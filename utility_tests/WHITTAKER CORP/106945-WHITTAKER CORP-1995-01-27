ITEM 1. BUSINESS.
 
THE REGISTRANT
 
  Whittaker Corporation ("Whittaker," the "Company," or the "Registrant") was
incorporated in California in 1947 and became a Delaware corporation in 1986.
Whittaker maintains its principal executive and administrative offices at 10880
Wilshire Boulevard, Los Angeles, California 90024 (telephone number 310-475-
9411).
 
  In its continuing operations, the Company has been active during fiscal 1994
almost solely in the aerospace business, including defense electronics, but is
now using its electronics technologies and expertise to expand into
telecommunications markets. During the past five years, the Company was also
active in the chemicals, specialty chemicals, and biotechnology businesses. Set
forth below is a description of the current business of the Company.
 
CONTINUING OPERATIONS
 
  The Company develops specialized aerospace and electronic technologies to
create products for aircraft, defense, telecommunications and industrial
markets. The Company's products and services are developed and produced by
three divisions: Aerospace, which manufactures and markets proprietary fuel,
hydraulic and pneumatic flow control valves and fire detection system products
fitted on aircraft and ground-based gas turbines; Electronics Systems, which
designs, develops and sells a wide array of highly reliable defense electronics
products and systems; and Communications, which developed and is manufacturing
and marketing advanced Asynchronous Transfer Mode ("ATM") telecommunications
products and systems.
 
  Principal applications and representative products of the Company's
continuing operations include:
 
    Fluid and Pneumatic Controls. The Company designs and manufactures a
  broad range of fluid control devices for both commercial and military
  aircraft. The products are designed to control pneumatic, hydraulic and
  fuel flows in aircraft systems. In commercial applications, they are used
  on virtually all Boeing and Douglas commercial aircraft, virtually all
  recent Airbus models, and virtually all other aircraft and jet engines
  manufactured in the world, with the exception of those manufactured in the
  former Communist countries. In addition, commercial and industrial
  applications include ground refueling devices and controls for cogeneration
  gas turbine power plants. In military applications, the products are used
  on military transports, bombers, helicopters, fighters and landing craft.
  Both commercial and military applications include aircraft jet engines
  built by General Electric and Pratt & Whitney. Sales of fluid controls were
  $52.9 million in fiscal 1994, $43.0 million in fiscal 1993, and $77.4
  million in fiscal 1992.
 
    Command, Control and Communications. The Company designs and manufactures
  electronic systems for command, control and communications, including
  display and analysis systems, digital data links, signal data converters,
  tactical simulation systems, and wide-band encrypted secure voice and data
  systems that permit secure communications. The Company also has developed
  modular software that is designed to be portable to any real-time operating
  system. A user-friendly, window-based display and a unique table-driven
  architecture provide easy interface between various equipment and
  facilitate the addition of new equipment. Sales of command, control and
  communications systems were $24.5 million in fiscal 1994, $29.8 million in
  fiscal 1993, and $24.8 million in fiscal 1992.
 
    Radio Frequency/Survivability Systems. The Company designs radar
  countermeasure systems and electronic combat systems that provide radar and
  proximity fuse jamming using an internally developed radio frequency memory
  unit. Experience in technique development was used to invent a proprietary
  monopulse radar countermeasures generator that is applicable to most modern
  jamming systems. A Company-designed radar system detects tactical ballistic
  missiles, such as the SCUD, and allows early warning for the civilian
  population and for deployment of weapons. Other ground-based radar
  surveillance and tracking systems of the Company, including replicas of
  enemy radar systems, are used in tactical training. Sales of radio
  frequency/survivability systems were $8.9 million in fiscal 1994, $10.1
  million in fiscal 1993, and $19.2 million in fiscal 1992.
 
                                       1
<PAGE>
 
    Other Electronics Products. The Company designs and manufactures high
  reliability silicon dioxide insulated coaxial and multiple conductor cable
  systems which permit broad-band data transmission and control function
  operation in extreme environments. Atmospheric monitoring systems are
  provided for timely warning of emergency conditions. Applications for these
  technologies include signal transmission and control functions inside
  nuclear power plants and reactors, power and control monitoring and
  electronic valve control at oil refineries, extreme environmental condition
  cable applications near jet engines, and critical connections in airborne
  electronic countermeasure systems. The Company also designs and
  manufactures expendable high-energy-density batteries utilized primarily
  for missile and space applications. These applications require watt seconds
  of energy and demand the highest availability and reliability due to their
  critical functions. The Company supplies these batteries to meet the
  extreme environmental requirement of airborne applications.
 
    Data Managers. The Company provides a unique combination of hardware and
  software that interfaces very high speed computers with lower speed
  computers as well as storage disks, recorders and other peripherals. The
  data manager allows simultaneous input and output of large amounts of data,
  facilitating real time analysis and storage. Data managers provide this
  capability in applications for jet engine data recording, transfer of video
  data in simulators, and command and control applications. The Company is
  developing a lower-priced version of the data manager with ATM capabilities
  to provide services for telecommunications markets, including real-time
  access to full-motion video on demand and to other applications requiring
  access to large amounts of video data, such as medical imaging. The lower-
  priced version is expected to be available in mid-1995.
 
    ATM Enterprise Network Access Switch. Using high-speed switching hardware
  and software technology developed for defense applications, the Company has
  designed, developed, successfully tested, and started production of an ATM
  Enterprise Network Access Switch ("ATM ENAS"). The ATM ENAS is designed for
  use by business customers and by telephone companies to efficiently
  transfer data files, video, still images, and multi-media files at
  extremely high speeds among local area networks over telephone companies'
  fiber optic-wide area networks. The Company expects to begin shipments of
  the ATM ENAS during the second quarter of fiscal 1995.
 
  Sales directly or indirectly to the United States Government, primarily under
military procurement contracts, represented approximately 49% of the sales from
continuing operations in fiscal 1994, compared to 68% in fiscal 1993 and 58% in
fiscal 1992. In addition to the normal risks found in any business, companies
engaged in supplying military equipment to the United States Government are
subject to certain industry specific risks, including dependence on
Congressional appropriations and administrative allotment of funds, time and
investment required for design and development, significant changes in contract
scheduling, complexity of designs and the rapidity with which they may become
obsolete, and change in Governmental procurement legislation and regulations
and other policies which may reflect military and political developments. All
contracts with the United States Government are subject to termination at any
time for the convenience of the Government if deemed in its best interest.
Contracts that are terminated for convenience generally provide for payments to
a contractor for its costs and for fees or profits related to work accomplished
through the date of termination.
 
  Approximately 20% of sales from continuing operations arose from exports to
customers outside the United States.
 
  At October 31, 1994, funded backlog totalled $69,300,000 (compared to
$75,200,000 at October 31, 1993), of which $14,300,000 is not expected to be
filled within fiscal 1995.
 
  The markets in which the Company operates are generally highly competitive,
with competition centering on price, product performance and product support.
Competitors of the Company in such markets may have substantially greater
financial resources, research and design capabilities, and manufacturing
capacity.
 
  The Company spent $2,700,000, $1,700,000, and $1,100,000 on research and
development activities in continuing operations in fiscal 1994, 1993, and 1992,
respectively.

DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS
 
  In October 1991, the Company spun off its biotechnology business. In
addition, since the beginning of the Company's divestiture program in 1989, the
Company has sold its Anjac/Doron, Duall/Wind, Chemical Coatings, Heico
Chemicals, Park Chemical, Ram Chemicals, Specialty Chemicals, Technibilt, Water
Management, Whittaker Metals, Winters Industries and Yardney Electric
Corporation units. The divestiture program has been substantially completed.
Remaining to be divested is a 996-acre parcel of land formerly used, until
1987, by the Company's former Bermite division, a discontinued technology unit.
See Notes 3 and 4 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II,
Item 8 of this Form 10-K for information about the spin off and discontinued
operations, respectively.
 
ACQUISITIONS
 
  On March 27, 1994, the Company acquired the assets and business of Systron-
Donner Safety Systems for a total purchase price of $13.0 million in cash.
Safety Systems manufactures and sells fire, smoke and overheating detectors and
systems for commercial and military aircraft and jet engines. The Company
intends to continue its previously announced strategy of growth by selective
acquisitions that complement the Company's existing businesses and product
lines.
 
ENVIRONMENTAL
 
  Compliance with Federal, state and local provisions which have been enacted
or adopted regulating the discharge of materials into the environment, or
otherwise relating to the protection of the environment, has had no material
effect upon the capital expenditures, earnings or competitive position of the
Company, nor is the Company estimating any material capital expenditures for
environmental control facilities in fiscal 1995 and 1996.
 
EMPLOYEE RELATIONS
 
  As of October 31, 1994, the Company employed approximately 800 persons in its
businesses, about 13% of whom were represented by labor organizations. The
Company believes that it has generally good relations with its employees.
 
ITEM 2. PROPERTIES.
 
  The corporate headquarters of the Company is located in 23,000 square feet of
leased office space in Los Angeles, California. The table below provides
information with respect to the principal production facilities utilized by the
Company as of October 31, 1994.

  The terms of the Company's leases range from one year to 20 years. The
termination of any of the short-term leases would not have a material adverse
effect on the Company's operations. See Note 9 of Notes to Consolidated
Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K.
 
  The Company believes that, in general, its plants and equipment are
adequately maintained, in good operating condition and adequate for the
Company's present needs. The Company regularly upgrades and modernizes its
facilities and equipment, and expands its facilities as necessary to meet
customer requirements. Capital additions by the Company were approximately $2.5
million for continuing operations in fiscal 1994.

ITEM 3. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS.
 
ENVIRONMENTAL MATTERS
 
  As a result primarily of the activities of its discontinued operations, the
Company is a potentially responsible party in a number of actions filed under
the Comprehensive Environmental Response Compensation and Liability Act of 1980
("CERCLA"). CERCLA, also known as "Superfund," is the main Federal law enacted
to address public health and environmental concerns arising with respect to
past treatment and disposal of hazardous substances. The Company also is a
potentially responsible party in a number of actions brought under state laws
patterned after CERCLA.
 
  CERCLA and such other state laws provide for the imposition of clean-up
liability on anyone who arranges for the disposal or treatment of hazardous
substances at designated sites. Accordingly, anyone who generates hazardous
substances may be a potentially responsible party if the treatment, storage, or
disposal facility that handles the substances becomes the subject of an
environmental clean-up under such laws. This is true even if the treatment,
storage, or disposal facility has the proper licenses and permits issued by
appropriate governmental authorities and treats, stores, or disposes of the
hazardous substances in accordance with the terms of such licenses and permits.
The various state environmental agencies and the U.S. Environmental Protection
Agency take the position under these environmental laws that all responsible
parties are jointly and severally liable for the costs of cleaning up sites
subject to their jurisdiction and for any environmental damages caused by the
treatment or disposal of hazardous substances at such sites.
 
  In nearly all of the environmental matters in which the Company is involved,
the Company contributed a very small amount (generally much less than 1%) of
the total wastes treated or disposed of at these various treatment or disposal
facilities and participates as a so-called "de minimis" party. De minimis
parties are generally allowed to settle their potential liability for clean-up
activities by agreeing with the state or Federal environmental authorities and
the other, larger responsible parties to bear a share of the past and estimated
future clean-up costs based on the volume of the waste each de minimis party
contributed, plus a "premium" or "multiplier." These premiums or multipliers
are designed to allow for the uncertainty of estimates of future costs and the
desirability of settling liability early to avoid so-called transaction costs,
i.e., the legal, consulting, and other expenses, which tend to consume a
significant amount of the funds actually spent on the resolution of
environmental matters.
 
  Where the Company does not qualify for such treatment, where the Company's
potential liability on a particular environmental matter could be significant,
or where the Company believes that the premium or multiplier for a de minimis
settlement is unreasonable, the Company may elect to participate in the
settlement or remediation activities as, or on the same basis as, a major
party, generally paying its allocated share of remediation expenses and
transaction costs as they are incurred, often over several years.
 
  In addition to the CERCLA and similar actions described above, the Company
also, from time to time, conducts or participates in remedial investigations
and clean-up activities at facilities currently or formerly occupied by its
operating units. In the most significant of these sites, the Company has "clean
closed" 13 of 14 facilities regulated under the Resource Conservation and
Recovery Act at its former Bermite division in Santa Clarita, California. The
Company is currently working to close the 14th of such facilities and to
complete an investigation of the entire property in anticipation of developing
the property for a planned mixed-use residential and commercial development.
 
  The Company's Denver, Colorado-based Power Storage Systems unit has been
cited by the City of Denver for violations arising from its failure to have a
waste water discharge permit for a sink used in the brazing operations of a
satellite welding facility. The Company believes it has defenses to many of the
allegations cited in the notice of violation from the City of Denver and is in
discussions with the City to settle this matter.
 
  In 1994, the Company made cash expenditures of approximately $1.8 million on
environmental matters.

OTHER LEGAL MATTERS
 
  There are also various other claims and suits pending against the Company.
Based on an evaluation, which included consultation with counsel concerning the
legal and factual issues involved, the Company is of the opinion that such
claims and suits pending against the Company, including the environmental
matters discussed above, will not have a material adverse effect, singly or in
the aggregate, on the financial position of the Company. See Note 10 of Notes
to Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K.

DIVIDENDS
 
  Dividends of $1.25 were declared on each share of $5.00 Preferred, and
dividends of $.25 were declared on each share of Series D Preferred Stock, for
each quarter of Whittaker's two most recent fiscal years. No dividends have
been declared on the Common Stock during the two most recent fiscal years.
 
  Under the Company's current credit facility with a group of banks, there are
restrictions that materially limit the amount of cash dividends that may be
paid on the Common Stock. The Company may pay cash dividends on the Common
Stock if the Company meets a cash flow test measured at the end of the fiscal
quarter immediately preceding the payment of the dividend, and the cumulative
amount of all cash dividends paid on the Common Stock does not exceed 20% of
the net income of the Company determined on a cumulative basis from January
30, 1995 through the end of the fiscal quarter immediately preceding the
payment of the dividend. In the foreseeable future, in light of the Company's
strategy of using earnings from operations to fund growth internally and by
selective acquisitions, the Company's present intention is to refrain from
paying cash dividends on the Common Stock even if the Company is able to do so
under its current credit facility. Although the Company expects to continue
paying dividends on the $5.00 Preferred, there can be no assurance that such
dividends will be continued. See Note 5 of Notes to Consolidated Financial
Statements in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K for further description of the
Company's credit facility.

ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND
        FINANCIAL CONDITION.
 
RESULTS OF OPERATIONS
 
 Comparison of 1994 to 1993
 
  Sales from continuing operations for fiscal 1994 increased 9.6% to $126.4
million from fiscal 1993 sales of $115.4 million. Sales increased in 1994 in
part as a result of the Company's acquisition of a telecommunications business
in July 1993, two aircraft fluid control product lines in the fourth quarter
of fiscal 1993, and an aerospace business during the second quarter of fiscal
1994. The acquisitions offset decreases in government sales. In the aggregate,
the acquired businesses and product lines accounted for $27.5 million of 1994
sales, compared to $1.7 million in 1993, reflecting the implementation of the
Company's previously announced strategy of growth by selective acquisitions to
complement the Company's existing businesses and product lines. The aerospace
business acquired in March 1994 contributed $10.5 million to 1994 sales.
Management expects that the acquired businesses and product lines will
continue to contribute to sales in fiscal 1995 at least at the annual rate at
which they contributed in fiscal 1994.
 
  The increased sales in fiscal 1994 also included the recognition of $4.0
million of sales during the first quarter of 1994 related to the partial
settlement of a termination claim against a defense electronics products
customer. The Company expects that additional revenue may result in fiscal
1995 from final settlement of the claim. Sales of defense electronics products
were adversely affected during the first and second quarters of fiscal 1994 by
the January 17 Northridge earthquake and by delays in the receipt of new
contract bookings. Sales of high-energy-density batteries declined because of
decreasing demand and intense price competition, trends that are expected to
continue. The Company's pyrotechnic devices unit was sold in the third quarter
of fiscal 1993 after contributing $3.6 million to fiscal 1993 sales.
 
  A shrinking U.S. defense budget has contributed to both the decline in sales
to the United States Government and in delays in the receipt of new contract
bookings. In addition, new aircraft production has not rebounded from the
reductions in the early 1990's, with the result that sales of aircraft fluid
control products have not rebounded to their early 1990's levels. Management
expects that this trend will continue at least for the near to medium term. In
fiscal 1994, the Company began marketing its aircraft fluid control and other
aerospace products to manufacturers of industrial, land-based gas turbines,
which are similar to jet engines. The Company intends to continue to do so.
Although management believes that there may be significant demand for the
Company's aerospace products in these and other industrial markets, management
does not currently expect that sales of aerospace products in industrial
markets will contribute a material amount of revenue to the Company in fiscal
1995, and there can be no assurance that such sales will contribute a material
amount of revenue to the Company in later years.
 
  Gross margin increased in fiscal 1994 to $53.2 million, or 42.0% of sales,
from $44.2 million, or 38.3% of sales in fiscal 1993. The increase was due
primarily to a product mix that included a higher portion of after-market
aircraft fluid control products. Also contributing to the increase in gross
margin was $3.5 million resulting from the partial termination claim
settlement described above, under which the Company recorded as revenue and
will receive at least $4.0 million in cash, with an associated cost of sale of
$0.5 million. The increase in gross margin was offset partially by lower
margins in radio frequency/survivability products resulting primarily from a
higher mix of cost-plus contracts and, to some degree, from the effects of the
interruption of the business and damage caused by the January 17 Northridge
earthquake.
 
  As a percentage of sales, engineering, selling and general and
administrative expenses increased from 24.7% in fiscal 1993 to 26.2% in fiscal
1994. The increase primarily was the result of additional expenses of the
acquired aerospace business, and executive bonus payments made for 1994
compared to limited payments made for 1993. The increase was offset partially
by income associated with the Company's defined benefit pension plan.
 
  Net income in fiscal 1994 from continuing operations was $10.1 million, or
$1.06 per share, compared to $7.7 million, or $0.81 per share, in fiscal 1993,
not including net income in 1993 of $1.5 million, or $0.16 per share,
resulting from a change in the method of accounting for income taxes in
accordance with the
 
                                       9
<PAGE>
 
Statement of Financial Accounting Standards SFAS No. 109, and a net after-tax
loss from discontinued operations of $2.0 million, or $0.21 per share. Income
before income taxes for fiscal 1994 was $16.5 million, compared to $12.5
million before income taxes and the accounting change for 1993.
 
 Comparison of 1993 to 1992
 
  Sales from continuing operations for fiscal 1993 decreased by $44.5 million
from fiscal 1992, reflecting decreased volume in aircraft fluid controls of
$34.4 million. This represents a decrease of 44.4% from fiscal 1992, primarily
due to a reduction of new aircraft production and reduced after market sales.
Also unfavorably affecting sales by $3.5 million was the sale of the
pyrotechnic devices unit in the third quarter of fiscal 1993. The remaining
decrease was attributable to reduced volume of defense electronics products,
high-energy-density batteries and cable products.
 
  Cost of sales as a percentage of sales increased slightly in fiscal 1993
primarily due to unabsorbed overhead as a result of the sales volume decrease
in aircraft fluid controls, which was partially offset by improved margins
related to changes in product mix. The $6.5 million, or 18.6%, decrease in
operating expenses (engineering, selling and general and administrative
expenses) was due primarily to reduced employee incentive costs of $3.5
million and a reduction of headcount throughout the operations. Interest
expense was lower in fiscal 1993 as a result of a lower level of debt and
lower interest rates.
 
  Income from continuing operations before taxes decreased by $9.4 million,
primarily due to the lower sales volume, slightly lower margins due to the
under-absorption of overhead, which was offset partially by reduced
engineering, selling and general and administrative expenses, and lower
interest costs.
 
  The 1993 loss from discontinued operations represents the after-tax effect
of a non-recurring charge of $3.5 million before tax to settle a patent
infringement case involving the Company's former Technibilt shopping cart
division, and a $0.7 million additional loss provision for ongoing costs for
discontinued operations. Partially offsetting the discontinued operations
charges was $1.0 million of interest income related to the resolution of tax
issues associated with previously discontinued operations.
 
  The accounting change reflects the adoption, retroactive to the first
quarter of fiscal 1993, of the Financial Accounting Standards Board Statement
No. 109, "Accounting for Income Taxes." This change in accounting increased
net income by $1.5 million.
 
 General
 
  In fiscal 1994, 1993 and 1992, approximately 49%, 68% and 58%, respectively,
of the Company's sales from continuing operations were directly or indirectly
attributable to the United States Government. In addition to the normal risks
found in any business, companies engaged in supplying military equipment to
the United States Government are subject to certain industry specific risks,
including dependence on Congressional appropriations and administrative
allotment of funds, time and investment required for design and development,
significant changes in contract scheduling, complexity of designs and the
rapidity with which they may become obsolete, and change in Governmental
procurement legislation and regulations and other policies which may reflect
military and political developments. A loss of Government business, although
not anticipated by the Company, could have a material adverse effect on the
Company's operations.
 
  In August 1994, the Company was awarded a $10.9 million cost-reimbursement
contract from the United States Army to develop three new versions of the
Company's previously developed battlefield electronic countermeasures system,
capable of detonating incoming artillery and mortar rounds, designated the
Shortstop Electronic Protection System ("SEPS"). The contract did not
contribute a material amount of revenue to the Company in 1994, but successful
development of the new SEPS versions could, subject to all of the risks and
uncertainties that apply to military procurement generally, as discussed
above, result in subsequent SEPS production contracts, which could then have a
material effect on the Company's sales. There can be no assurance, however,
whether or when any such contracts would be awarded.
 
                                      10
<PAGE>
 
  The Company is discussing with a foreign government the potential sale and
installation of a Company-designed radar system that detects tactical ballistic
missiles and allows early warning for the civilian population and for
deployment of weapons. The discussion could result in an agreement during
fiscal 1995. If the discussions result in an agreement, annual sales of defense
electronics products could increase by up to $50 million for up to five years.
Because of the uncertainties of the military procurement processes of foreign
governments, the need for the foreign government to provide budget authority
for the potential procurement, and all the uncertainties that apply to military
procurement generally, as discussed above, there can be no assurance that an
agreement will be reached or, if reached, what the contract price would be.
 
  The Company has developed and successfully tested an ATM Enterprise Network
Access Switch ("ATM ENAS"). Potential customers who have participated in the
testing of the ATM ENAS have expressed an interest in the purchase of
quantities of the ATM ENAS that could support profitable commercial production.
The Company is exploring price and other sales terms with these potential
customers. There can be no assurance, however, that agreements on sales will be
reached. In addition, the Company is developing a lower-priced version of the
data manager produced by the acquired telecommunications business which will
have ATM capabilities and which, if successfully developed, is expected to be
available to the market in mid-1995. These telecommunications products could
contribute increased amounts to sales of telecommunications products. There can
be no assurance, however, that development of the lower-priced version of the
data manager will be successful, that the market will accept the products, or
that sales of the products will be material or profitable.
 
  Effective November 1, 1992 the Company changed its method of accounting for
income taxes from the deferred method to the liability method required by
Financial Accounting Standards Board Statement No. 109, "Accounting for Income
Taxes." As permitted under the new rules, prior years' financial statements
have not been restated. In December 1990, the Board issued a new standard,
"Employers' Accounting for Post-retirement Benefits Other Than Pensions," which
the Company adopted in 1994. The adoption did not have a material effect on the
Company's consolidated financial statements.
 
  The outlook for future sales is difficult to predict given the uncertainties
related to the declining U.S. defense budget and related reductions and
terminations of U.S. Government defense contracts. Any negative effect on sales
related to this uncertainty may be offset in the future by contracts for new,
technologically advanced electronic defense systems, new commercial products in
the expanding telecommunications markets, and sales of aerospace and electronic
products into industrial markets. Thus, past Company performance may not be a
reliable indicator of future performance.
 
FINANCIAL CONDITION
 
  At October 31, 1994, the Company's debt totaled $60.3 million, which
consisted of $42.5 million of loans under a revolving bank credit facility,
$16.5 million under a bank term loan, and $1.3 million of other debt. In
addition, there were $12.5 million of letters of credit outstanding under the
revolving credit facility. On January 24, 1995, the Company and a new group of
banks entered into a new credit agreement which consists of a $65.0 million
revolving credit facility with a three-year term expiring in January 1998 and a
$35.0 million term loan that is to be repaid in quarterly installments over
five years. Interest on loans outstanding under the credit agreement are based,
at the Company's option, on LIBOR or the agent bank's prime rate. The annual
interest rate based on LIBOR may range between LIBOR plus 1% and LIBOR plus
1.875%, and the annual interest rate based on the prime rate may range between
prime and prime plus .50%. The agreement includes financial covenants with
respect to financial leverage, cash flow, and tangible net worth. Proceeds from
the new credit facility were used to pay off and cancel the old credit facility
and will be used going forward to fund working capital and acquisitions. At the
date of the new credit facility, the debt outstanding was $35.0 million under
the term loan, of which $3.75 million is due within fiscal year 1995, and
$20.5 million of loans and $12.7 million of letters of credit under the
revolving credit facility.
 
  The Company's ratio of long-term debt, including the current portion, to
capitalization (stockholders' equity plus debt) was 39.1% at October 31, 1994,
compared to 43.0% at the end of 1993, reflecting a $10.1 million contribution
to stockholders' equity from fiscal 1994 net income and continued reduction of
 
                                       11
<PAGE>
 
bank debt from cash flow generated by operations. It is expected that the
Company will continue to use cash generated from operations to reduce debt.
However, as discussed below, some cash and debt availability may be used to
finance additional acquisitions.
 
  Cash flow provided by continuing operations in fiscal 1994 was $21.8 million,
compared to $16.1 million in fiscal 1993. The increase resulted primarily from
higher net income and an income tax recovery. There were offsetting reductions
in cash provided and used as a result of changes in accounts receivable and
accounts payable, respectively. Cash used in investing activities was $15.7
million in fiscal 1994, which included $13.0 million for the acquisition of an
aerospace business and capital expenditures of $2.5 million. During fiscal
1993, the Company also used cash of $13.0 million to make acquisitions, but
received cash of $3.5 million as a result of the sale of the pyrotechnic
devices unit. Cash flow used in financing activities was $2.8 million in fiscal
1994 and $7.2 million in fiscal 1993, primarily the result of, in each case,
the reduction of debt.
 
  Included in accounts receivable are claims amounting to $5.6 million,
compared to $6.5 million at year-end 1993, related to certain United States
Government prime contracts and subcontracts. These claims have been recorded in
accordance with generally accepted accounting principles to the extent of
contract costs incurred. These costs were incurred in connection with customer
caused delays and disruptions, errors in technical data, a partial termination
for convenience and other unanticipated causes. These claims were filed for
amounts aggregating $31.8 million, compared to $22.2 million at year-end 1993,
substantially in excess of amounts recorded. While the outcome of these claims
presently cannot be determined, in the opinion of the Company and its counsel
the recorded amount is a reasonable estimate of the minimum amount expected to
be collected. These claims are subject to negotiation and audit by the U.S.
Government, the prime contractor customer, or both, and are presently at
various stages of settlement, litigation or appeal.
 
  During the third quarter of fiscal 1994, the Company submitted a claim to its
insurance carriers to recover the costs of repair and replacement of assets and
for the costs of business interruption brought about by the January 17
Northridge earthquake. To date, the Company has been paid $5.4 million on
account and is negotiating with the carriers to reach a final settlement, which
is expected to occur during the first half of fiscal 1995. The Company provided
reserves of $1.0 million in January 1994 to cover insurance deductibles and
does not believe that additional reserves will be required. Current assets in
1994 included $1.0 million, net of insurance payments on account, as a result
of deferrals of building and property repair and replacement costs and other
expenses that are expected to be recovered under the earthquake insurance
claim.
 
  Capital expenditures for fiscal 1994 were $2.5 million, compared to $1.3
million in fiscal 1993 and$2.2 million in fiscal 1992. At October 31, 1994,
there were approximately $2.4 million of approved capital expenditures
outstanding for the replacement and upgrade of existing plant and equipment at
the Company's various facilities. Funds for these and other capital
expenditures are expected to be provided from operations. Capital expenditures
are limited to specified annual amounts by covenants contained in the Company's
credit agreement. It is anticipated that the amounts under the covenants will
be sufficient to allow the Company to continue to maintain and upgrade existing
facilities.
 
  During fiscal 1994, most of the Company's expenditures on research and
development were devoted to the development and successful testing of the ATM
ENAS. It is anticipated that the Company will require additional expenditures
for development of its telecommunications products to remain competitive, and
that sufficient funds will be generated by operations for research and
development of these and other Company products.
 
  At October 31, 1994, the Company had recognized $1.4 million of net deferred
tax assets. The net deferred tax assets are expected to be realized from future
taxable income. In the absence of such future taxable income, the current level
of net deferred tax assets could be realized pursuant to the carryback
provisions of the Federal tax law. A valuation allowance of $0.8 million has
been established for the state tax effect of the temporary differences due to
certain limitations imposed by state tax law.
 
  On March 27, 1994, the Company acquired the assets and business of Systron-
Donner Safety Systems for a total purchase price of $13.0 million in cash.
Safety Systems manufactures and sells fire, smoke and overheating detectors and
systems for commercial and military aircraft and jet engines.
 
                                       12
<PAGE>
 
  The Company intends to continue its previously announced strategy of growth
by selective acquisitions that complement the Company's core businesses,
financed by cash from operations and from borrowings under its revolving credit
facility and, where appropriate, by issuance of new debt or equity securities
of the Company. The Company intends to pursue its acquisition strategy with
careful regard for profitability and the Company's need for liquidity. There
can be no assurance, however, that any acquisitions will occur or that an
acquisition that does occur will not adversely affect the Company's net income
or liquidity.
 
  The Company's program for divestiture of its discontinued operations was
substantially completed by the end of fiscal 1992. Remaining to be divested is
a 996-acre parcel of land, which was used until 1987 by the Company's former
Bermite division, a discontinued technology unit. The land is located in the
city of Santa Clarita, California, approximately 35 miles from downtown Los
Angeles. The Company has entered into a development agreement with a real
estate developer to seek entitlements (the right granted by political
authorities to develop real property) to develop this property as a mixed-use
residential, commercial, retail, and light industrial development. Following
receipt of these entitlements, the Company will pursue the most advantageous
means to realize the value of this asset.
 
  As a result primarily of the activities of its discontinued operations, the
Company is a potentially responsible party in a number of actions filed under
the Comprehensive Environmental Response Compensation and Liability Act of 1980
("CERCLA"). CERCLA, also known as "Superfund," is the main Federal law enacted
to address public health and environmental concerns arising with respect to the
past treatment and disposal of hazardous substances. The Company is also a
potentially responsible party in a number of other actions brought under state
laws patterned after CERCLA. In nearly all of these matters, the Company
contributed a small amount (generally less than 1%) of the total treated or
disposed of waste. In addition to the CERCLA and similar actions described
above, the Company also, from time to time, conducts or participates in
remedial investigations and clean-up activities at facilities currently or
formerly occupied by its operating units. In fiscal 1994, the Company made cash
expenditures of approximately $1.8 million on environmental matters.
 
  The Company has typically purchased insurance annually. In certain years,
after evaluating the availability and cost of insurance, the Company did not
purchase insurance for certain risks, including workers' compensation and
product liability. Moreover, the Company's insurance carriers have taken the
position that in certain cases the Company is uninsured for environmental
matters, a position that the Company disputes in certain instances.
Consequently, the Company is without insurance for various risks, including
product liability for certain products manufactured in the past. The Company
does, however, have product liability insurance for products it currently
manufactures.
 
  At October 31, 1994, the Company had provided for its aggregate liability
related to various claims, including uninsured risks and potential claims in
connection with the environmental matters noted above. The amounts provided on
the Company's books for contingencies, including environmental matters, are
recorded at gross amounts. Because of the uncertainty with respect to the
amount of probable insurance recoveries, these potential insurance recoveries
are not taken into account as a reduction of those amounts provided unless an
insurance carrier has agreed to such coverage. The Company does not anticipate
that these matters will have a material adverse effect on the Company's
financial position or on its ability to meet its working capital and capital
expenditure needs. Although the Company has recorded estimated liabilities for
contingent losses, including uninsured risks and claims in connection with
environmental matters, in accordance with generally accepted accounting
principles, the absence of or denial of various insurance coverages represents
a potential exposure for the Company, and the net income of the Company in
future periods could be adversely affected if uninsured losses in excess of
amounts recorded were to be incurred.

                         REPORT OF INDEPENDENT AUDITORS
 
To the Stockholders and Board of Directors of Whittaker Corporation
 
  We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Whittaker
Corporation as ofOctober 31, 1994 and 1993, and the related consolidated
statements of income, stockholders' equity, and cash flows for each of the
three years in the period ended October 31, 1994. These financial statements
are the responsibility of the Company's management. Our responsibility is to
express an opinion on these financial statements based on our audits.
 
  We conducted our audits in accordance with generally accepted auditing
standards. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of
material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence
supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. An audit
also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant
estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial
statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis
for our opinion.
 
  In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above
present fairly, in all material respects, the consolidated financial position
of Whittaker Corporation at October 31, 1994 and 1993, and the consolidated
results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the
period endedOctober 31, 1994, in conformity with generally accepted accounting
principles.
 
  As discussed in Note 7 to the consolidated financial statements, in 1993 the
Company changed its method of accounting for income taxes.

</TABLE>
 
  (C) Intangibles: Goodwill is amortized using the straight-line method over 40
years. Amortization of other intangible assets is being provided on a straight-
line basis over the following periods:
 
<TABLE>
      <S>                   <C>
      Purchased software... 7 years
      Technology........... 5-15 years
      Patents.............. Lesser of economic or legal life
</TABLE>
 
  Accumulated amortization of goodwill and of other intangible assets at
October 31, 1994 amounted to $1,852,000 and $5,858,000, respectively, and at
October 31, 1993 amounted to $1,397,000 and $5,351,000, respectively.
 
  (D) Property and Depreciation: Property, plant and equipment is recorded at
cost. Depreciation is computed principally by use of the straight-line method
based upon the estimated useful lives of such assets, ranging from four to 30
years. Depreciation of leasehold improvements is computed on a straight-line
basis over the shorter of the estimated useful lives of the improvements or the
terms of the leases.
 
  (E) Long-Term Contracts: Whittaker generally accounts for long-term contracts
using the percentage-of-completion method. At October 31, 1994 and 1993,
unbilled receivables relating to long-term contracts of $33,867,000 and
$39,212,000, respectively, were included in trade accounts receivable. These
amounts represent recoverable costs and accrued profits, not billable to
customers at the balance sheet date, which are generally billable upon product
delivery and acceptance and/or completion of milestones. Amounts representing
retainages under contracts are not material. Claims subject to further
negotiations and which may not be collected within one year are approximately
$1.6 million at October 31, 1994.
 
  (F) Company Business: The Company is engaged in the design, manufacture and
distribution of a wide variety of fluid control devices, defense electronic
systems, cable systems, high-energy-density batteries and a data manager
product for aerospace and other performance-critical applications.
 
  In fiscal 1994, 1993, and 1992 approximately 49%, 68% and 58%, respectively,
of Whittaker's sales from continuing operations were directly or indirectly to
the United States Government. In fiscal 1994, 1993 and 1992 approximately 20%,
11% and 11%, respectively, of Whittaker's sales from continuing operations
arose from exports to customers outside the United States. Approximately 31% of
the Company's accounts receivable are from the U.S. Government, and the balance
is primarily from prime defense contractors with the U.S. Government, aircraft
manufacturers, and foreign and commercial customers.
 
  (G) Research and Development Costs: Costs for research and development are
expensed as incurred. In fiscal 1994, 1993 and 1992 research and development
costs totaled $2.7 million, $1.7 million and $1.1 million, respectively.

                             WHITTAKER CORPORATION
 
            NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS--(CONTINUED)

NOTE 1. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND COMPANY BUSINESS--
        (CONTINUED)
 
  The Company acquired businesses for $13.0 million in cash during each of
fiscal 1994 and 1993. The acquisitions were accounted for under the purchase
method, and in the year of acquisition the results of operations for 1994 and
1993 include sales of $10.5 million and $1.7 million, respectively, related to
these businesses. These acquisitions resulted in goodwill of $5.6 million and
$6.9 million in fiscal 1994 and 1993, respectively.
 
NOTE 2. EARNINGS PER SHARE
 
  Earnings per share have been computed based on the weighted average number of
common and common equivalent shares outstanding during the periods, after
deducting from net income the dividend requirements on the outstanding $5.00
Cumulative Convertible Preferred Stock. Common stock equivalents include Series
D Participating Convertible Preferred Stock and dilutive employee stock
options, calculated using the treasury stock method.
 
  Fully diluted earnings per share are not presented because the calculations
result in dilution of less than 3%.
 
NOTE 3. SPIN OFF OF BIOTECHNOLOGY BUSINESS SEGMENT
 
  In October 1991, the following events relating to Whittaker's biotechnology
segment occurred:
 
    (i) Whittaker's Board of Directors, to effect the spin off of Whittaker's
  biotechnology business, declared a special distribution to Whittaker's
  stockholders of record on November 14, 1991 of one share of BioWhittaker,
  Inc. Common Stock for each Whittaker common share held on the record date
  and for each Whittaker common share into which Whittaker's Series D
  Participating Convertible Preferred Stock held on the record date was
  convertible. Whittaker thereby distributed all of the shares of
  BioWhittaker Common Stock owned by Whittaker, which represented 80.1% of
  the shares outstanding after giving effect to the sale of BioWhittaker
  Common Stock to the Boehringer Ingelheim group (see below).
 
    (ii) BioWhittaker, Inc. sold to Anasco GmbH for $23 million in cash newly
  issued BioWhittaker Common Stock, which represented 19.9% of its
  outstanding Common Stock after such sale. Anasco GmbH is a member of the
  Boehringer Ingelheim group headquartered in Germany.
 
    (iii) BioWhittaker paid to Whittaker $23.3 million, the outstanding
  balance of its intercompany payable to Whittaker.
 
NOTE 4. DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS
 
  On February 27, 1989, the Board of Directors approved a divestiture and
restructuring program (the "Divestiture Program") pursuant to which a
substantial part of the Company's chemical operations and certain of its
technology operations were discontinued. During the first quarter of fiscal
1990, the Company discontinued its specialty chemicals segment. During the
fourth quarter of fiscal 1991, the Company spun off its biotechnology segment
(see Note 3).

</TABLE>
 
  Assets held for sale at October 31, 1994 and October 31, 1993 include $23.7
million and $22.7 million, respectively, of land formerly used by a
discontinued technology unit. The Company is in the process of obtaining
entitlements--the right granted by political authorities to develop real
property--for the land.
 
  The 1993 loss from discontinued operations consists of the $3.5 million
settlement of a patent infringement case and a $.7 million loss provision for
ongoing costs related to previously discontinued operations. These losses were
partially offset by the receipt of $1.0 million of interest related to the
resolution of tax issues associated with previously discontinued operations.
 
  The 1992 Gain on disposal of discontinued operations of $2.3 million reflects
the tax benefit resulting from the resolution of certain tax issues relating to
previously discontinued operations on a more favorable basis than previously
anticipated. Proceeds realized in fiscal 1992 from the disposition of
discontinued businesses amounted to $7.8 million.
 
  In connection with the discontinuance of various businesses, the Company
remains liable for certain retained obligations and for certain future claims,
principally environmental and product liability. The noncurrent portion of such
items is included in "Other Noncurrent Liabilities" in the balance sheet.
 
NOTE 5. LONG-TERM DEBT
 
  At October 31, 1994, the Company's debt totaled $60.3 million, which
consisted of $42.5 million of loans under a revolving bank credit facility,
$16.5 million under a bank term loan, and $1.3 million of other debt. In
addition, there were $12.5 million of letters of credit outstanding under the
revolving credit facility. On January 24, 1995, the Company and a new group of
banks entered into a new credit agreement which consists of a $65.0 million
revolving credit facility with a three-year term expiring in January 1998 and a
$35.0 million term loan that is to be repaid in quarterly installments over
five years. Interest on loans outstanding under the credit agreement are based,
at the Company's option, on LIBOR or the agent bank's prime rate. The annual
interest rate based on LIBOR may range between LIBOR plus 1% and LIBOR plus
1.875%, and the annual interest rate based on the prime rate may range between
prime and prime plus .50%. The Company is obligated to pay letter of credit
fees which may range between LIBOR plus .625% per annum and LIBOR plus 2.0% per
annum on the aggregate amount of outstanding letters of credit, and commitment
fees which may range between .25% per annum and .375% per annum on the unused
amount of the revolving credit facility. The agreement includes financial
covenants with respect to financial leverage, cash flow, and tangible net
worth. Proceeds from the new credit facility were used to pay off and cancel
the old credit facility and will be used going forward to fund working capital
and acquisitions. At the date of the new credit facility, the debt outstanding

  At October 31, 1994, options for 1,137,586 shares were exercisable.
 
  The Company's Stockholder Rights Plan gives each holder of the Company's
Common Stock one right for each share of Common Stock held. Each right entitles
the holder to purchase from the Company 1/100 of a share of a new series of the
Company's preferred stock (Series A Participating Cumulative Preferred Stock)
at an exercise price of $125 per 1/100 of a share. The rights will become
exercisable and will detach from the Common Stock 10 days after any person or
group acquires 25% or more of the Company's Common Stock, or 10 business days
after any person or group commences a tender or exchange offer which, if
consummated, would result in that person or group owning at least 25% of the
Company's Common Stock.

            NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS--(CONTINUED)

NOTE 6. CAPITAL STOCK--(CONTINUED)
 
  If any person acquires 25% or more of the Company's Common Stock, each right
will entitle the holder, other than the acquiring person, to purchase for the
exercise price Common Stock of the Company with a value of twice the exercise
price. In addition, if following an acquisition by any person or group of 25%
or more of the Company's Common Stock, the Company is involved in a merger or
other business combination transaction, or sells more than 50% of its assets or
earning power to any person, each right will entitle the holder, other than the
acquiring person, to purchase for the exercise price Common Stock of the
acquiring person with a value of twice the exercise price.
 
  The Company may redeem the rights at $.01 per right at any time until the
tenth day after any person or group has acquired 25% or more of its Common
Stock. The rights will expire November 29, 1998, unless earlier redeemed. The
Stockholder Rights Plan may be supplemented or amended at the direction of the
Company without the approval of the holders of rights, except as otherwise set
forth in the Stockholder Rights Plan. At October 31, 1994, 150,000 preferred
shares were reserved for these rights.

  Effective November 1, 1992 the Company changed its method of accounting for
income taxes from the deferred method to the liability method required by
Financial Accounting Standards Board Statement No. 109, "Accounting for Income
Taxes." As permitted under the new rules, prior year's financial statements
have not been restated. The cumulative effect of adopting Statement 109 as of
November 1, 1992 was to increase net income by $1,512,000.
 
  Income tax expense is included in the consolidated statements of income as

NOTE 8. PENSION AND RETIREMENT PLANS
 
  Most of Whittaker's domestic employees are covered by its noncontributory
defined benefit pension plan. The benefits are based on years of service and
the employee's highest compensation for five consecutive years during the last
ten years of credited service. Contributions are intended to provide for
benefits attributable to service both to date and expected to be provided in
the future. The Company funds the plan in accordance with the Employee
Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, as amended (ERISA).
 
  The following table sets forth the plan's funded status and amounts
recognized in the Company's consolidated balance sheet:

</TABLE>
 
  During the fourth quarter of fiscal 1994, the Company's Board of Directors
approved an amendment to the defined benefit pension plan which suspends the
benefits related to future service of plan participants. The effect of the
amendment was to reduce the plan's projected benefit obligation at October 31,
1994 by $3,887,000. The amount was fully absorbed by unrecognized net losses at
October 31, 1994 related to the plan and, accordingly, no curtailment gain was
recognized.
 
  The weighted average discount rate and rate of increase in future
compensation levels used in determining the actuarial present value of the
projected benefit obligation were 8.0% and 0.0% (as a result of the curtailment
noted above), respectively, at October 31, 1994, and 7.5% and 5.0%,
respectively, at October 31, 1993. The expected long-term rate of return on
plan assets was 8.75% for the years ended October 31, 1994 and 1993, and 9% for
the year ended October 31, 1992.

  The Company also sponsors unfunded supplemental nonqualified executive and
director plans. At October 31, 1994, the projected benefit obligation for those
plans totaled $5,257,000, of which $1,022,000 is subject to later amortization.
The remaining $4,235,000 is accrued as a liability in the consolidated balance
sheet. In addition, the Company sponsors a defined contribution 401(k) plan
covering a majority of its domestic employees under which contributions by
employees are partially matched by the Company.
 
  Total pension and retirement expense was as follows:

NOTE 10. COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES
 
 The Company has typically purchased insurance annually. In certain years,
after evaluating the availability and cost of insurance, the Company did not
purchase insurance for certain risks, including workers' compensation and
product liability. Moreover, the Company's insurance carriers have taken the
position that in certain cases the Company is uninsured for environmental
matters, a position that the Company disputes in certain instances.
Consequently, the Company is without insurance for various risks, including
product liability for certain products manufactured in the past. The Company
does, however, have product liability insurance for products it currently
manufactures.
 
  As a result primarily of the activities of its discontinued operations, the
Company is a potentially responsible party in a number of actions filed under
the Comprehensive Environmental Response Compensation and Liability Act of 1980
("CERCLA"). CERCLA, also known as "Superfund," is the main Federal law enacted
to address public health and environmental concerns arising with respect to the
past treatment and disposal of hazardous substances. The Company is also a
potentially responsible party in a number of other actions brought under state
laws patterned after CERCLA. In nearly all of these matters, the Company
contributed a small amount (generally less than 1%) of the total treated or
disposed of waste.
 
  At October 31, 1994, the Company had provided for its aggregate liability
related to various claims, including uninsured risks and potential claims in
connection with the environmental matters noted above. The amounts provided on
the Company's books for contingencies, including environmental matters, are
recorded at gross amounts. Because of the uncertainty with respect to the
amount of probable insurance recoveries, these potential insurance recoveries
are not taken into account as a reduction of those amounts provided unless an
insurance carrier has agreed to such coverage. The Company does not anticipate
that these matters will have a material adverse effect on the Company's
financial position or on its ability to meet its working capital and capital
expenditure needs. Although the Company has recorded estimated liabilities for
contingent losses, including uninsured risks and claims in connection with
environmental matters, in accordance with generally accepted accounting
principles, the absence of or denial of various insurance coverages represents
a potential exposure for the Company, and the net income of the Company in
future periods could be adversely affected if uninsured losses in excess of
amounts recorded were to be incurred.

  Long term debt: The carrying amounts of the Company's borrowings approximate
their fair value. The Company's bank credit facility is a variable rate
facility that reprices frequently.
 
  Note receivable: The carrying amounts of the Company's note receivable
approximate their fair value.

              ------------------                                            
made on the Closing Date and shall be made on notice received by the Agent from
the Borrower (pursuant to a Notice of Borrowing) not later than 12:00 noon
(Dallas, Texas time) (or such later time as the Agent may agree) on the Business
Day immediately preceding the Closing Date.  Such Notice of Borrowing shall be
irrevocable upon receipt by the Agent.  Each Lender shall, before 2:00 p.m.
(Dallas, Texas time) on the Closing Date, make available for the account of its
Applicable Lending Office to the Agent such Lender's ratable share of such
Borrowings by depositing same day funds in the Agent's Account.

          (B) SUBSEQUENT REVOLVING BORROWINGS.  Each Revolving Borrowing
              -------------------------------                           
occurring after the Closing Date shall be made on notice received by the Agent
from the Borrower (pursuant to a Notice of Borrowing) not later than 12:00 noon
(Dallas, Texas time) (a) on the Business Day prior to the date of such Borrowing
if such Borrowing consists of Base Rate Advances, and (b) on the third Business
Day prior to the date of such Borrowing if such Borrowing consists of Eurodollar
Rate Advances.  Each such Notice of Borrowing shall be irrevocable upon receipt
by the Agent and, in the case of any Notice of Borrowing for Eurodollar Rate
Advances, the Borrower shall indemnify each Lender against any loss, cost or
expense incurred by such Lender as a result of any failure to fulfill on or
before the date specified by such Notice of Borrowing the applicable conditions
set forth in this Section 2.02 or Article IV, including, without limitation, any
loss (including loss of anticipated profits), cost or expense incurred by


                                      18
<PAGE>
 
reason of the liquidation or reemployment of deposits or other funds acquired by
such Lender to fund the Advance to be made by such Lender as a part of such
Borrowing when such Advance, as a result of such failure, is not made on such
date.

          (C) ADVANCES BY LENDERS.  If the Agent receives a Notice of Borrowing,
              -------------------

Texas time) on the Business Day prior to the date of such Borrowing or, if such
Borrowing consists of Eurodollar Rate Advances, the third Business Day prior to
the date of such Borrowing) give each Lender notice of such Notice of Borrowing.
Each Lender shall before 2:00 p.m. (Dallas, Texas time) on the date of such
Borrowing, make available for the account of its Applicable Lending Office to
the Agent such Lender's ratable portion of such Borrowing by depositing same day
funds in the Agent's Account.  Unless the Agent shall have received written
notice from a Lender prior to the date of any Borrowing hereunder that such
Lender will not make available to the Agent such Lender's ratable portion of
such Borrowing, the Agent may assume that such Lender has made such ratable
portion available to the Agent on the date of such Borrowing in accordance with
the terms hereof and the Agent may, in reliance upon such assumption, but shall
not be required to, make available to or for the account of the Borrower on such
date a corresponding amount.  If and to the extent that such Lender shall not
have so made such ratable portion available to the Agent and the Agent makes
such ratable portion available to the Borrower, such Lender and the Borrower,
without prejudice to any rights or remedies that the Borrower may have against
such Lender, severally agree to repay to the Agent forthwith on demand such
corresponding amount together with interest thereon, for each day from the date
such amount is made available to or for the account of the Borrower until the
date such amount is repaid to the Agent, at (A) in the case of the Borrower, the
interest rate applicable at the time to the Advances comprising such Borrowing,
and (B) in the case of such Lender, the Federal Funds Rate.  If such Lender
shall pay to the Agent such amount, such amount so paid shall constitute such
Lender's Advance as part of the relevant Borrowing for purposes of this
Agreement and, to the extent that the Borrower previously paid such amount to
the Agent, the Agent will refund to the Borrower such amount so paid, but
without interest.

          (D) DISBURSEMENT OF ADVANCES.  Upon fulfillment of the applicable
              ------------------------                                     
conditions set forth in Article IV, the Agent will make funds for any Borrowing
available to the Borrower by crediting the Borrower's Account, subject to the

first make a portion of such funds equal to any outstanding L/C Advance under
any Letter of Credit, and any interest accrued and unpaid thereon to and as of
such date, available to the applicable Issuing Bank for reimbursement of such
L/C Advance and payment of such interest.

              ------------------------------                                    
the Advance to be made by it as part of any Borrowing shall not relieve any
other Lender of its obligation, if any, hereunder to make its Advance on the
date of such Borrowing, but no Lender shall be responsible for the failure of
any other Lender to make the Advance to be made by such other Lender on the date
of any Borrowing.

   -----------------------                                                    
specified period (an "INTEREST PERIOD" for such Eurodollar Rate Advance) in
                      ---------------                                      
accordance with subsection (c) below, provided, however, that the Borrower may
                                      --------  -------                       
not have more than ten Eurodollar Rate Advances owing to any Lender outstanding
at any one time.  Each Interest Period shall be one, two, three, or six months,
at the Borrower's selection pursuant to subsection (c) below, provided, however,
                                                              --------  ------- 
that:

               (i)  The first day of an Interest Period for any Eurodollar Rate
     Advance shall be either the last day of any then current Interest Period
     for such Advance or, if there shall be no then current Interest Period for
     such Advance, any Business Day.

               (ii) The Borrower may not select any Interest Period that ends
     after any principal repayment installment date unless, after giving effect
     to such selection, the aggregate principal amount of Base Rate Advances and
     of Eurodollar Rate Advances having Interest Periods


                                      21
<PAGE>
 
     that end on or prior to such principal repayment installment date shall be
     at least equal to the aggregate principal amount of Advances due and
     payable on or prior to such date.

               (iii)  Whenever the last day of any Interest Period would
     otherwise occur on a day other than a Business Day, the last day of such
     Interest Period shall be extended to occur on the next succeeding Business
     Day; provided, however, that if such extension would cause the last day of
          --------  -------                                                    
     such Interest Period to occur in the next following month, the last day of
     such Interest Period shall occur on the next preceding Business Day.

               (iv)   Whenever the first day of any Interest Period occurs on a
     day of the month for which there is no numerically corresponding day in the
     calendar month that succeeds such initial calendar month by the number of
     months equal to the number of months of such Interest Period, such Interest
     Period shall end on the last Business Day of such succeeding calendar
     month.

          (C)  INTEREST ON EURODOLLAR RATE ADVANCES.  The Borrower may from time
               ------------------------------------                             
to time, on the condition that no Event of Default has occurred and is
continuing, and subject to the provisions of Sections 2.06(b) and 2.06(e), elect
to pay interest on all or any portion of any Advances of the same Type during
any Interest Period therefor at a rate per annum equal to the sum of the
Eurodollar Rate for such Interest Period for such Advances plus the Applicable
Margin for Eurodollar Rate Advances in effect from time to time, by notice,
specifying the Type and amount of the Advances as to which such election is made
(which amount shall aggregate at least $2,000,000 or any multiple of $500,000 in
excess thereof) and the first day and duration of such Interest Period, received
by the Agent before 12:00 noon (Dallas, Texas time) three Business Days prior to
the first day of such Interest Period.  If the Borrower has made such election
for Eurodollar Rate Advances for any Interest Period, the Borrower shall pay
interest on the unpaid principal amount of such Eurodollar Rate Advances during
such Interest Period, payable in arrears on the last day of such Interest Period
and, in the case of any Interest Period of six months, on the date which is
three months after the first day of such Interest Period, in each case at a rate
equal, subject to Section 2.06(d), to the sum of the Eurodollar Rate for such
Interest Period for such Eurodollar Rate Advances plus the Applicable Margin for
Eurodollar Rate Advances in effect from time to time during such Interest
Period.  On the last day of each Interest Period for any Eurodollar Rate
Advance, the unpaid principal balance thereof shall automatically become and
bear interest as a Base Rate Advance, except to the extent that the Borrower has
elected to pay interest on all or any portion of such amount for a new Interest
Period commencing on such day in accordance with this Section 2.06(c).  Each
notice by the Borrower under this Section 2.06(c) shall be irrevocable upon
receipt by the Agent, and the Borrower shall indemnify each Lender against any
loss, cost or expense incurred by such Lender as a result of any failure to
fulfill on or before the date specified by such notice the applicable conditions
set forth in this Section 2.06(c) or Article IV, including, without limitation,
any loss (including loss of anticipated profits), cost or expense incurred by
reason of the liquidation or reemployment of deposits or other funds acquired by
such Lender to fund any such Eurodollar Rate Advance when such Eurodollar Rate
Advance, as a result of such failure, is not made or does not become effective.

          (D)  DEFAULT INTEREST.  If either (i) any Event of Default occurs and
               ----------------                                                
is continuing as a result of the failure by the Borrower to pay when due any
amount of principal, interest or fees payable by the Borrower under the Loan
Documents, or (ii) upon the occurrence and during the continuance of any other
Event of Default the Agent shall give written notice to the Borrower (which
notice shall only be given, and may thereafter only be withdrawn, at the
direction of the Required Lenders) declaring default interest to be applicable,
then, so long as any such Event of Default is continuing, the Borrower shall, at
the dates set forth herein for the payment of interest and upon demand, (A) pay
interest on all


                                      22
<PAGE>
 
Base Rate Advances and any other amounts owing hereunder not paid when due
(other than then outstanding Eurodollar Rate Advances) at a rate per annum (the
"DEFAULT RATE") equal at all times to the rate otherwise applicable to Base Rate
 ------------                                                                   
Advances plus 2.00% per annum, and (B) pay interest on each then outstanding
         ----                                                               
Eurodollar Rate Advance at a rate per annum equal at all times to the rate
otherwise applicable to such Eurodollar Rate Advance plus 2.00% per annum.
                                                     ----                 

          (E)  SUSPENSION OF EURODOLLAR RATE ADVANCES.
               -------------------------------------- 

               (I)  ILLEGALITY.  Notwithstanding any other provision of this
                    ----------                                              
     Agreement, if the introduction of or any change in or in the interpretation
     of any law or regulation shall make it unlawful, or any central bank or
     other governmental authority shall assert that it is unlawful, for any
     Lender or its Eurodollar Lending Office to perform its obligations
     hereunder to make Eurodollar Rate Advances or to continue to fund or
     maintain Eurodollar Rate Advances hereunder, then, on notice thereof and
     demand therefor by such Lender to the Borrower through the Agent, (A) each
     Eurodollar Rate Advance will automatically, upon such demand (or, if
     permitted by applicable law, at the end of the then applicable Interest
     Period), be converted into a Base Rate Advance and (B) the obligation of
     the Lenders to make or maintain, or to convert Advances into, Eurodollar
     Rate Advances shall be suspended until the Agent shall notify the Borrower
     that such Lender has determined that the circumstances causing such
     suspension no longer exist; provided, however, that, before making any such
                                 --------  -------                              
     demand, each Lender agrees to use reasonable efforts (consistent with its
     internal policy and legal and regulatory restrictions) to designate a
     different Eurodollar Lending Office if the making of such a designation
     would allow such Lender or its Eurodollar Lending Office to continue to
     perform its obligations to make Eurodollar Rate Advances or  to continue to
     fund or maintain Eurodollar Rate Advances and would not, in the judgment of
     such Lender, be otherwise disadvantageous to such Lender.

              (II)  OTHER CIRCUMSTANCES.  If, with respect to any Eurodollar
                    -------------------                                     
     Rate Advances, the Required Lenders notify the Agent that the Eurodollar
     Rate for any Interest Period for such Advances will not adequately reflect
     the cost to such Lenders of making, funding or maintaining their Eurodollar
     Rate Advances for such Interest Period, the Agent shall forthwith so notify
     the Borrower and the Lenders, whereupon (i) each such Eurodollar Rate
     Advance will automatically, on the last day of the then existing Interest
     Period therefor, convert into a Base Rate Advance and (ii) the obligation
     of the Lenders to make, or to convert Advances into, Eurodollar Rate
     Advances shall be suspended until the Agent shall notify the Borrower that
     such Lenders have determined that the circumstances causing such suspension
     no longer exist.

             (III)  LENDERS' OBLIGATION TO NOTIFY AGENT.  If any Lender shall
                    -----------------------------------                      
     give notice to the Agent under Section 2.06(e)(i) or (ii) and such Lender
     shall thereafter determine that the circumstances causing such notice no
     longer exist, such Lender shall promptly give written notice thereof to the
     Borrower and the Agent, and the Agent shall thereafter give notice thereof
     to the Borrower and the other Lenders.

              (IV)  SUSPENSION ON EVENT OF DEFAULT.  Upon the occurrence and
                    ------------------------------                          
     during the continuance of any Event of Default, (i) each Eurodollar Rate
     Advance will automatically, on the last day of the then existing Interest
     Period therefor, convert into a Base Rate Advance and (ii) the obligation
     of the Lenders to make, or to convert Advances into, Eurodollar Rate
     Advances shall be suspended.

          SECTION 2.07.  FEES.
                         ---- 

          (A) AGENT'S FEES.  The Borrower agrees to pay to the Agent, for its
              ------------                                                   
own account, the fees in the amounts and at the times set forth in the letter
dated December 5, 1994 from NationsBank and NationsBanc Capital Markets, Inc.,
to the Borrower, and agreed to and accepted by the Borrower on December 7, 1994.

          (B) COMMITMENT FEES.  The Borrower agrees to pay to the Agent a
              ---------------                                            
commitment fee on the average daily Unused Revolving Commitment of each Lender,
for the account of such Lender, from the Closing Date in the case of each
Initial Lender and from the effective date specified in the Assignment and
Acceptance pursuant to which it became a Lender in the case of each other Lender
until the Revolving Commitment Termination Date, at the rate per annum equal to
the Commitment Fee Percentage in effect from time to time, payable in arrears on
the 21st day of each April, July, October and January, commencing April 21,
1995, and on the Revolving Commitment Termination Date.

          (C) ABSOLUTE OBLIGATION.  The Borrower's obligation hereunder to pay
              -------------------                                             
the fees referred to in this Section 2.07 shall be absolute and unconditional
and shall survive the making and repayment of Advances, the termination of all
Letter of Credit Obligations and the termination of this Agreement.  All fees
which are due or become due pursuant to this Section 2.07 are nonrefundable.

          SECTION 2.08.  INCREASED COSTS, ETC.
                         -------------------- 

          (A) INCREASED COSTS.  If, due to either (i) the introduction of or any
              ---------------                                                   
change after the date hereof in or in the interpretation of any law or
regulation or (ii) the compliance with any guideline or request from any central
bank or other governmental authority (whether or not having the force of law)
issued or made after the date hereof, there shall be any increase in the cost to
any Lender of agreeing to make or of making, funding or maintaining Eurodollar
Rate Advances or of agreeing to issue or of issuing or maintaining or purchasing
participations in Letters of Credit, then the Borrower shall from time to time,
within five Business Days of written demand by such Lender (with a copy of such
demand to the Agent), pay to the Agent for the account of such Lender additional
amounts sufficient to compensate such Lender for such increased cost; provided,
                                                                      -------- 
however, that, before making any such demand, each Lender agrees to use
- - -------                                                                
reasonable efforts (consistent with its internal policy and legal and regulatory
restrictions) to designate a different Applicable Lending Office if the making
of such a designation would avoid the need for, or reduce the amount of, such
increased cost and would not, in the reasonable judgment of such Lender, be
otherwise disadvantageous to such Lender.  A certificate as to the amount of
such increased cost, submitted to the Borrower by such Lender, shall be
conclusive and binding for all purposes, absent manifest error.

          (B) CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS.  If any Lender determines that compliance
              --------------------                                           
with any law or regulation or any guideline or request from any central bank or
other governmental authority (whether or not having the force of law) which is
issued or made after the date hereof affects or would affect the amount of
capital required or expected to be maintained by such Lender or any corporation
controlling such Lender and that the amount of such capital is increased by or
based upon the existence of such Lender's commitment to lend or to issue or
purchase participations in Letters of Credit hereunder and other commitments of
such type or the issuance or maintenance of or purchase of participations in the
Letters of Credit (or similar contingent obligations), then, within five
Business Days of written demand by such Lender (with a copy of such demand to
the Agent), the Borrower shall pay to the Agent for the account of such Lender,
from time to time as specified by such Lender, additional amounts sufficient to
compensate such Lender in the light of such circumstances, to the extent that
such Lender reasonably


                                      24
<PAGE>
 
determines such increase in capital to be allocable to the existence of such
Lender's commitment to lend or to issue or purchase participations in Letters of
Credit hereunder or to the issuance or maintenance of or purchase of
participations in any Letters of Credit.  A certificate as to such amounts
submitted to the Borrower by such Lender, shall be conclusive and binding for
all purposes, absent manifest error.

          (C) LIMITATIONS ON BORROWER'S COMPENSATION OBLIGATIONS.
              --------------------------------------------------  
Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement to the contrary, the
Borrower shall not be obligated to make any payment to any Lender pursuant to
this Section 2.08 in respect of any amounts or costs (i) accruing in or
allocable to any period prior to the 180th day preceding written demand by such
Lender for payment therefor (unless such amounts or costs prior to such 180 day
period result from the retroactive effect of any of the events described in the
foregoing Sections 2.08(a) or 2.08(b) giving rise to such written demand and
which occurred during such 180 day period) or (ii) resulting from a change in
the Lender's Applicable Lending Office.

          SECTION 2.09.  PAYMENTS AND COMPUTATIONS.
                         ------------------------- 

          (A) PAYMENTS BY BORROWER.  The Borrower shall make each payment
              --------------------                                       
hereunder and under any other Loan Document to which it is a party, irrespective
of and without condition or deduction for any counterclaim, defense, recoupment
or setoff, in lawful money of the United States and in same day funds delivered
to the Agent not later than 1:00 p.m. (Dallas, Texas time) on the day when due
by deposit of such funds to the Agent's Account.  Any payment so delivered to
the Agent after 1:00 p.m. (Dallas, Texas time) on any Business Day, or on any
day which is not a Business Day, shall be deemed received by the Agent on the
next succeeding Business Day.  Subject to Section 2.14, the Agent will promptly
after receipt of each payment cause to be distributed like funds relating to the
payment of principal, interest, commitment fees or letter of credit fees ratably
to the Lenders for the account of their respective Applicable Lending Offices,
and like funds relating to the payment of any other amount payable to any Lender
or any Issuing Bank (including payments with respect to Letters of Credit and
payments for the account of any Lender under Sections 2.08, 2.10 or 9.04(c)) to
such Lender for the account of its Applicable Lending Office or to such Issuing
Bank, in each case to be applied in accordance with, and subject to, the terms
of this Agreement, including Section 2.09(e) below.  Upon its acceptance of an
Assignment and Acceptance and recording of the information contained therein in
the Register pursuant to Section 9.07(c), from and after the effective date
specified in such Assignment and Acceptance, the Agent shall make all payments
hereunder and under any other Loan Document in respect of the interest assigned
thereby to the Lender assignee thereunder, and the parties to such Assignment
and Acceptance shall make all appropriate adjustments in such payments for
periods prior to such effective date directly between themselves.

          (B) COMPUTATIONS.  All computations of interest in respect of Base
              ------------                                                  
Rate Advances (and in respect of any other amount payable hereunder other than
Eurodollar Rate Advances and Letter of Credit fees) and all computations in
respect of commitment fees shall be made by the Agent on the basis of a year of
365 days and all computations of interest in respect of Eurodollar Rate Advances
and all computations in respect of Letter of Credit fees shall be made by the
Agent on the basis of a year of 360 days, in each case for the actual number of
days (including the first day but excluding the last day) occurring in the
period for which such interest or fees are payable; provided that if any Advance
                                                    --------                    
is repaid on the same day on which it is made, one day's interest shall be paid
on such Advance.  Each determination by the Agent of an interest rate, fee,
commission or discount rate hereunder shall be conclusive and binding for all
purposes, absent manifest error.


                                      25
<PAGE>
 
          (C) PAYMENTS ASSUMED.  Unless the Agent shall have received notice
              ----------------                                              
from the Borrower prior to the date on which any payment is due to the Lenders
or any Issuing Bank hereunder that the Borrower will not make such payment in
full, the Agent may assume that the Borrower has made such payment in full to
the Agent on such date and the Agent may, in reliance upon such assumption, but
shall not be required to, cause to be distributed to each Lender or such Issuing
Bank on such due date an amount equal to the amount then due to such Lender or
such Issuing Bank.  If and to the extent that the Borrower shall not have so
made such payment in full to the Agent, each Lender and Issuing Bank shall repay
to the Agent forthwith on demand such amount distributed to such Lender or
Issuing Bank together with interest thereon, for each day from the date such
amount is distributed to such Lender or Issuing Bank until the date such Lender
or Issuing Bank repays such amount to the Agent, at the Federal Funds Rate.

          (D) APPLICATION OF PAYMENTS SPECIFIED BY THE BORROWER.  Except as
              -------------------------------------------------            
otherwise specified herein, so long as no Event of Default has occurred and is
continuing, all payments shall be applied as instructed by the Borrower if such
instructions are received by the Agent prior to or contemporaneously with
receipt of funds therefor.

          (E) APPLICATION OF PAYMENTS NOT OTHERWISE SPECIFIED.  If the Agent
              -----------------------------------------------               
receives funds for application to the Advances or any Letter of Credit
Obligations or other Obligations of the Borrower under the Loan Documents under
circumstances for which the Loan Documents do not specify the Advances or the
Facility or the Obligations to which, or the manner in which, such funds are to
be applied, the Agent may elect to distribute such funds first, to the Issuing
                                                         -----                
Banks ratably in payment of the principal of and interest on any outstanding L/C
Advances, second, to each Lender ratably in accordance with such Lender's
          ------                                                         
proportionate share of all Advances then outstanding, in repayment or prepayment
of such of the outstanding Advances, and for application to such principal
installments, as the Agent may direct, and thereafter ratably to the Lenders in
repayment or prepayment of any other Obligations of the Borrower then
outstanding under the Loan Documents as the Agent shall direct, provided that if
                                                                --------        
an Event of Default has occurred and is continuing and the Term Advances have
been declared, or have become, due and payable in full and the Revolving
Commitments of the Lenders have been terminated in full, the Agent shall
distribute any payments and any proceeds of any collection, sale or other
realization or liquidation of any Collateral first, to the payment of all costs
                                             -----                             
and expenses of the Agent under the Loan Documents, second, to the Issuing Banks
                                                    ------                      
ratably in payment of the principal of and interest on any outstanding L/C
Advances, and third, to each Lender ratably in accordance with such Lender's
              -----                                                         
proportionate share of the principal amount of all Advances and Letter of Credit
Obligations then outstanding, in payment or prepayment of such Obligations owed
to such Lender under the Loan Documents, and for application to such principal
installments (if applicable) as the Agent shall direct.

          (F) PAYMENTS ON BUSINESS DAYS.  Whenever any payment hereunder shall
              -------------------------                                       
be stated to be due on a day other than a Business Day, such payment shall be
made on the next succeeding Business Day, and such extension of time shall in
such case be included in the computation of payment of interest and commitment
and other fees; provided, however, if such extension would cause payment of
                --------  -------                                          
interest on or principal of any Eurodollar Rate Advance to be made in the next

          SECTION 2.10.  TAXES.
                         ----- 

          (A) WITHHOLDING TAXES.  Any and all payments by the Borrower hereunder
              -----------------                                                 
shall be made, in accordance with Section 2.09, free and clear of and without
deduction for any and all present or future taxes, levies, imposts, deductions,
charges or withholdings, and all liabilities with respect thereto imposed by the
United States, any other jurisdiction resulting from a prior or present
connection between such jurisdiction and the Borrower, or any political
subdivision of any of the foregoing, excluding, in the case of each Lender, net
                                     ---------                                 
income taxes that are imposed by the United States and franchise taxes and
income taxes that are imposed on such Lender by the state or foreign
jurisdiction under the laws of which such Lender is organized or any political
subdivision thereof or therein, and franchise taxes based on income and income
taxes that are imposed on such Lender by any jurisdiction or any political
subdivision thereof or therein in which is located such Lender's Applicable
Lending Office or principal office (all such non-excluded taxes, levies,
imposts, deductions, charges, withholdings and liabilities being hereinafter
referred to as "TAXES").  If the Borrower shall be required by law to deduct any
                -----                                                           
Taxes from or in respect of any sum payable hereunder or under any other Loan
Document to any Lender or the Agent, (i) the sum payable shall be increased as
may be necessary so that after making all required deductions (including
deductions applicable to additional sums payable under this Section 2.10) such
Lender or the Agent (as the case may be) receives an amount equal to the sum it
would have received had no such deductions been made, (ii) the Borrower shall
make such deductions, and (iii) the Borrower shall pay the full amount deducted
to the relevant taxation authority or other authority in accordance with
applicable law.

          (B) OTHER TAXES.  In addition, the Borrower shall pay any present or
              -----------                                                     
future stamp, recording, documentary, excise or similar taxes, charges or levies
that arise from any payment made hereunder or from the execution, delivery or
registration of any Loan Document (hereinafter referred to as "OTHER TAXES").
                                                               -----------   

          (C) INDEMNIFICATION.  The Borrower shall indemnify each Lender for the
              ---------------                                                   
full amount of Taxes and Other Taxes, and for the full amount of taxes imposed
by any jurisdiction on amounts payable under this Section 2.10, paid by such
Lender and any liability (including penalties, additions to tax, interest and
expenses) arising therefrom or with respect thereto.  Payments pursuant to this
indemnification shall be made within 30 days from the date such Lender makes
written demand therefor setting forth in reasonable detail the basis of the
Borrower's obligation to indemnify such Lender pursuant to this Section 2.10;
                                                                             
provided, however, that (i) in the case of any Taxes or Other Taxes not required
- - --------  -------                                                               
by law to be deducted by the Borrower from or in respect of any sum payable
hereunder to any Lender, the Borrower shall be obligated to make payment to the
Lender pursuant to this Section 2.10 (A) in respect of such Taxes or Other Taxes
                        ------------                                            
only if written demand therefor has been made by the Lender within 180 days from
the date on which the Lender or the Agent, as the case may be, actually makes
payment of the Taxes or Other Taxes to the relevant taxing authority, and (B) in
respect of penalties and additions to tax attributable to late payment only to
the extent that such penalties or additions to tax are accrued after the written
demand therefor has been made by the Lender and (ii) the Borrower shall not be
obligated to pay any Taxes or Other Taxes to the extent the Taxes or Other Taxes
result from a change in the Lender's Applicable Lending Office.

          (D) EVIDENCE OF PAYMENT.  Within 30 days after the date of any payment
              -------------------                                               
of Taxes pursuant to Section 2.10(a) or (b), the Borrower shall furnish to the
Agent, at its address referred to in Section 9.02, evidence reasonably
satisfactory to the Agent of payment thereof.  In the case of any payment
hereunder for the account of any Lender which is made by the Borrower through an
account or branch outside the United States or on behalf of the Borrower by a
payor that is not a United States


                                      27
<PAGE>
 
person, if the Borrower determines that no Taxes are payable in respect thereof,
the Borrower shall, except where such mode of payment is at the request of such
Lender, furnish, or cause such payor to furnish, to the Agent, at such address,
a certificate from the appropriate taxing authority or authorities or an opinion
of counsel acceptable to the Agent, in either case stating that such payment is
exempt from Taxes.  For purposes of this subsection (d) and of subsection (e),
the terms "UNITED STATES" and "UNITED STATES PERSON" shall have the meanings
           -------------       --------------------                         
specified in Section 7701 of the Internal Revenue Code.

          (E) FOREIGN LENDERS AND ISSUING BANKS.  Each Initial Lender organized
              ---------------------------------                                
under the laws of a jurisdiction outside the United States shall, on or prior to
the date of its execution and delivery of this Agreement, and on the date of the
Assignment and Acceptance pursuant to which it became a Lender in the case of
each other Lender organized under the laws of a jurisdiction outside the United
States, and from time to time thereafter if any applicable form previously
provided by such Lender is no longer valid because such Lender has changed its
Applicable Lending Office or its principal office, place of incorporation or
fiscal residence or if otherwise requested in writing by the Borrower or the
Agent (but only so long thereafter as such Lender remains lawfully able to do
so), provide the Agent and the Borrower with (i) an accurate, complete and duly
executed Internal Revenue Service form 1001 or 4224, as appropriate, or any
successor form prescribed by the Internal Revenue Service, certifying that such
Lender is entitled to benefits under an income tax treaty to which the United
States is a party that reduces the rate of withholding tax on payments under
this Agreement or certifying that the income receivable pursuant to this
Agreement is effectively connected with the conduct of a trade or business in
the United States, and (ii) in the event that, by virtue of a change in law or
regulations, such forms are no longer valid evidence of a person's exemption
from withholding which is reasonably satisfactory to the Borrower, other
appropriate evidence supporting such person's exemption from withholding as the
Borrower may reasonably request.  If the form provided by a Lender at the time
such Lender first becomes a party to this Agreement indicates a United States
interest withholding tax rate in excess of zero, withholding tax at such rate
shall be considered excluded from Taxes; provided, however, that, if at the date
                                         --------  -------                      
of the Assignment and Acceptance pursuant to which a Lender assignee becomes a
party to this Agreement, the Lender assignor was entitled to payments under
subsection (a) in respect of United States withholding tax with respect to
interest paid at such date, then, to such extent, the term Taxes shall include
(in addition to withholding taxes that may be imposed in the future or other
amounts otherwise includable in Taxes) United States withholding tax, if any,
applicable with respect to the Lender assignee on such date.  If any form or
document referred to in this subsection (e) requires the disclosure of
information, other than information necessary to compute the tax payable and
information required on the date hereof by Internal Revenue Service form 1001 or
4224, that the Lender reasonably considers to be confidential, the Lender shall
give notice thereof to the Borrower and shall not be obligated to include in
such form or document such confidential information.

          (F) FAILURE TO PROVIDE FORMS.  For any period with respect to which a
              ------------------------                                         
Lender has failed to provide the Borrower with the appropriate form described in
subsection (e) at the times specified in subsection (e) whether or not such
Lender is lawfully able to do so (other than if such failure is due to a change
                                  ----- ----                                   
in law occurring after the date on which a form originally was required to be
provided), such Lender shall not be entitled to indemnification under subsection
(a) or (c) with respect to Taxes imposed by the United States to the extent that
the imposition of such Taxes is attributable to the failure to deliver such
form; provided, however, that should a Lender become subject to Taxes because of
      --------  -------                                                         
its failure to deliver a form required hereunder, the Borrower shall take such
reasonable steps as such Lender shall reasonably request to assist such Lender
to recover such Taxes.

          (G) CHANGE OF APPLICABLE LENDING OFFICE.  In the event that the
              -----------------------------------                        
Borrower becomes obligated to make an indemnification payment pursuant to
Section 2.10 to any Lender, the Borrower may


                                      28
<PAGE>
 
request that such Lender change the jurisdiction of its Applicable Lending
Office in order to avoid the need for or reduce the amount of any such
indemnification payment which may thereafter accrue.  The Borrower shall make
such request by delivering to such Lender a notice in writing (with a copy to
the Agent), in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to such Lender, in
which the Borrower identifies the jurisdiction to which the Borrower requests
such Lender change its Applicable Lending Office (which must be a jurisdiction
in which such Lender has a lending office) and promises to indemnify such Lender
against all reasonable out-of-pocket costs such Lender incurs in connection with
such change, and to which is attached an opinion of nationally recognized tax
counsel, in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to such Lender, to the
effect that such change will avoid the need for or reduce the amount of any such
indemnification payment which may thereafter accrue.  Upon receipt of such
notice, such Lender shall use reasonable efforts  (consistent with legal and
regulatory restrictions) to change the jurisdiction of its Applicable Lending
Office if such change would not, in the reasonable judgment of such Lender, be
disadvantageous to such Lender.

          (H) COOPERATION BY LENDERS.  Each Lender agrees that it will (i) take
              ----------------------                                           
all reasonable actions reasonably requested by the Borrower that are without
risk or material cost to such Lender to maintain all exemptions, if any,
available to it from withholding taxes (whether available by treaty or existing
administrative waiver), and (ii) to the extent reasonable and without risk or
material cost to it, otherwise cooperate with the Borrower to minimize any
amounts payable by the Borrower under this Section 2.10.

          (I) SURVIVAL.  Without prejudice to the survival of any other
              --------                                                 
agreement of the Borrower hereunder, the agreements and obligations of the
Borrower contained in this Section 2.10 shall survive the payment in full of
principal and interest hereunder.

          SECTION 2.11.  SHARING OF PAYMENTS, ETC.  If any Lender shall obtain
                         ------------------------                             
at any time any payment (whether voluntary, involuntary, through the exercise of
any right of set-off, or otherwise) (a) on account of Obligations due and
payable to such Lender hereunder at such time in excess of its ratable share
(according to the proportion of (i) the amount of such Obligations due and
payable to such Lender at such time to (ii) the aggregate amount of the
Obligations due and payable to all Lenders hereunder at such time) of payments
on account of the Obligations due and payable to all Lenders hereunder at such
time obtained by all the Lenders at such time or (b) on account of Obligations
owing (but not due and payable) to such Lender hereunder at such time in excess
of its ratable share (according to the proportion of (i) the amount of such
Obligations owing (but not due and payable) to such Lender at such time to (ii)
the aggregate amount of the Obligations owing (but not due and payable) to all
Lenders hereunder at such time) of payments on account of the Obligations owing
(but not due and payable) to all Lenders hereunder at such time obtained by all
the Lenders at such time, such Lender shall forthwith purchase from the other
Lenders such participations in the Obligations due and payable or owing to them,
as the case may be, as shall be necessary to cause such purchasing Lender to
share the excess payment ratably with each of them; provided, however, that if
                                                    --------  -------         
all or any portion of such excess payment is thereafter recovered from such
purchasing Lender, such purchase from each other Lender shall be rescinded and
such other Lender shall repay to the purchasing Lender the purchase price to the
extent of such other Lender's ratable share (according to the proportion of (i)
the purchase price paid to such Lender to (ii) the aggregate purchase price paid
to all Lenders) of such recovery together with an amount equal to such Lender's
ratable share (according to the proportion of (i) the amount of such other
Lender's required repayment to (ii) the total amount so recovered from the
purchasing Lender) of any interest or other amount paid or payable by the
purchasing Lender in respect of the total amount so recovered.  The Borrower
agrees that any Lender so purchasing a participation from another Lender
pursuant to this Section 2.11 may, to the fullest extent permitted by law,
exercise all its rights of payment (including the


                                      29
<PAGE>
 
right of set-off) with respect to such participation as fully as if such Lender
were the direct creditor of the Borrower in the amount of such participation.

          SECTION 2.12.  USE OF PROCEEDS.  The proceeds of the Advances shall be
                         ---------------                                        
available (and the Borrower agrees that it shall use such proceeds) to repay in
full all amounts outstanding under the Existing Credit Agreement, to pay
transaction fees and expenses, to provide working capital for the Borrower and
its Subsidiaries and for other general corporate purposes of the Borrower and
its Subsidiaries, including financing Operating Investments permitted hereunder.

          SECTION 2.13.  EVIDENCE OF DEBT.
                         ---------------- 

          (A) MAINTENANCE OF ACCOUNTS BY LENDERS.  Each Lender shall maintain in
              ----------------------------------                                
accordance with its usual practice an account or accounts evidencing the
indebtedness of the Borrower to such Lender resulting from each Advance owing to
such Lender from time to time, including the amounts of principal and interest
payable and paid to such Lender from time to time hereunder.

          (B) MAINTENANCE OF ACCOUNTS BY AGENT.  The Register maintained by the
              --------------------------------                                 
Agent pursuant to Section 9.07(c) shall include a control account, and a
subsidiary account for each Lender, in which accounts (taken together) shall be
recorded (i) the date and amount of each Borrowing made hereunder, the Type and
Interest Type of the Advances comprising such Borrowing and any Interest Period
applicable thereto, (ii) the terms of each Assignment and Acceptance delivered
to and accepted by it, (iii) the amount of any principal or interest due and
payable or to become due and payable from the Borrower to each Lender hereunder,
and (iv) the amount of any sum received by the Agent from the Borrower hereunder
and each Lender's share thereof.  The entries made in the Register shall be
conclusive and binding for all purposes, absent manifest error.

          (C) EXECUTION OF PROMISSORY NOTES BY BORROWER.  The Borrower hereby
              -----------------------------------------                      
agrees that if, in the opinion of any Lender, a promissory note or other
evidence of debt is required, appropriate or desirable to reflect or enforce the
indebtedness of the Borrower resulting from the Term Advances or Revolving
Advances made, or to be made, by such Lender, then upon request of such Lender,
the Borrower shall promptly execute and deliver to such Lender, for each of the
Advances made or to be made by such Lender, a promissory note substantially in
the form of Exhibit A-1 for Term Advances and Exhibit A-2 for Revolving
Advances, each payable to the order of such Lender in an amount equal to the
Term Advances or Revolving Commitment (as the case may be) of such Lender.

                                  ARTICLE III

                     AMOUNTS AND TERMS OF LETTERS OF CREDIT

          SECTION 3.01.  THE LETTER OF CREDIT SUBFACILITY.  The Borrower may
                         --------------------------------                   
request any Lender, on the terms and conditions hereinafter set forth, to Issue,
and any such Lender may, if in its sole discretion it elects to do so, and the
L/C Bank shall, if no other Lender elects to do so, Issue Letters of Credit for
the account of the Borrower from time to time on any Business Day during the
period after the Closing Date until the Revolving Commitment Termination Date
(a) in an aggregate Available Amount for all Letters of Credit (including the
Existing Letters of Credit) not to exceed at any time $40,000,000 (the "LETTER
                                                                        ------
OF CREDIT SUBFACILITY"), and (b) in an Available Amount for each such Letter of
- - ---------------------                                                          
Credit not to exceed the Unused Revolving Commitments of the Lenders on such
Business Day.  No Letter of Credit shall have an expiration date (including all
rights of the Borrower or the beneficiary to require renewal) later than the
Revolving Commitment Termination Date.  As of the Closing Date, each


                                      30
<PAGE>
 
Existing Letter of Credit shall constitute, for all purposes of this Agreement
and the other Loan Documents, a Letter of Credit issued and outstanding
hereunder and shall, for purposes of Section 3.05, be deemed to be Issued
hereunder on the Closing Date.  Within the limits of the Letter of Credit
Subfacility, and subject to the limits referred to above, the Borrower may
request the Issuance of one or more Letters of Credit under this Section 3.01,
repay amounts due resulting from L/C Advances thereunder pursuant to Section
3.03, and request the Issuance of one or more additional Letters of Credit under
this Section 3.01.

          SECTION 3.02.  ISSUANCE OF LETTERS OF CREDIT.
                         ----------------------------- 

          (A) NOTICE OF ISSUANCE.  Each Letter of Credit shall be Issued
              ------------------                                        
pursuant to a Notice of Issuance, which must be received by the Agent and the
Issuing Bank not later than 12:00 noon (Dallas, Texas time) on the third
Business Day prior to the date of the proposed Issuance of such Letter of Credit
(or such shorter period as may be acceptable to the applicable Issuing Bank).
Each such Notice of Issuance shall specify whether such Letter of Credit is to
be a Commercial Letter of Credit, a Financial Standby Letter of Credit or a
Performance Standby Letter of Credit and shall further specify therein the
requested (i) date of such Issuance (which shall be a Business Day), (ii)
Available Amount of such Letter of Credit, (iii) expiration date of such Letter
of Credit, (iv) name and address of the beneficiary of such Letter of Credit,
and (v) form of such Letter of Credit, and shall be accompanied by such
customary application and agreement for letter of credit of the Issuing Bank (a
"LETTER OF CREDIT AGREEMENT") as the Issuing Bank may specify to the Borrower
 --------------------------                                                  
for use in connection with such requested Letter of Credit.

          (B) CONDITIONS TO ISSUANCE.  If (i) the requested form of such Letter
              ----------------------                                           
of Credit is acceptable to the Agent and the Issuing Bank in the reasonable
discretion of each, (ii) in the case of any Issuing Bank other than the L/C
Bank, such Issuing Bank elects in its sole discretion to Issue the requested
Letter of Credit, and (iii) such Issuing Bank has not received notice from the
Agent or Lenders holding at least 60% of the Revolving Commitments that the
Issuance of such Letter of Credit is not authorized because such Issuance would
not comply with the requirements of clause (a) or (b) of Section 3.01 or one or
more of the conditions set forth in Section 4.02 has not been satisfied, then
such Issuing Bank will, upon fulfillment of the applicable conditions set forth
in Section 4.02 and subject to the provisions of this Article III, make such
Letter of Credit available to the Borrower at its office referred to in Section
9.02 or as otherwise agreed upon with the Borrower in connection with such
Issuance.  In the event and to the extent that the provisions of any Letter of
Credit Agreement shall conflict with this Agreement, the provisions of this
Agreement shall govern.

          (C) REPORTS BY ISSUING BANKS.  Each Issuing Bank shall furnish to the
              ------------------------                                         
Agent (i) on the fifth Business Day of each month a written report summarizing
Issuance and expiration dates of Letters of Credit Issued by such Issuing Bank
during the preceding month and L/C Advances during such month under all Letters
of Credit Issued by such Issuing Bank, and (ii) two Business Days prior to the
last Business Day of each January, April, July and October, a written report
setting forth the average daily aggregate Available Amount during the preceding
calendar quarter of all Letters of Credit Issued by such Issuing Bank.

          SECTION 3.03.  DRAWING AND REIMBURSEMENT.  The Borrower agrees to
                         -------------------------                         
reimburse the Issuing Bank under each Letter of Credit, within one Business Day
after it has notice of any L/C Advance by such Issuing Bank thereunder (which
notice such Issuing Bank agrees promptly to give but the failure to give such
notice shall not reduce the Borrower's obligations hereunder), for the principal
amount of such L/C Advance, and shall pay to such Issuing Bank, on demand,
interest on the unreimbursed principal of such L/C Advance at a rate per annum
equal to (a) from the date of such L/C


                                      31
<PAGE>
 
Advance to the first Business Day after notice thereof has been given to the
Borrower, the rate applicable to Base Rate Advances in effect from time to time,
and (b) from and after such first Business Day, the Default Rate.  If the
Borrower shall fail to so reimburse the Issuing Bank within one Business Day
after the Borrower receives notice that any such L/C Advance has been made, then
upon demand by the Issuing Bank, and whether or not a Default has occurred and
is continuing or any conditions set forth in Section 4.02 are satisfied, each
Lender shall purchase from such Issuing Bank, and such Issuing Bank shall sell
and assign to each Lender, such Lender's Pro Rata Share of such outstanding L/C
Advance as of the date of such purchase, by making available for the account of
such Issuing Bank, by deposit to the Agent's Account, in same day funds, an
amount equal to the sum of (i) the portion of the outstanding principal amount
of such L/C Advance to be purchased by such Lender, plus (ii) interest on such
amount, for each day from the date on which such L/C Advance is made until the
date such amount is paid to the Agent, at the Federal Funds Rate. Each Lender

stock (or any securities, instruments, warrants, option or purchase rights,
conversion or exchange rights, calls, commitments or claims of any character
convertible into or exercisable for capital stock) of the Borrower or any
Subsidiary of the Borrower is subject to issuance under any security,
instrument, warrant, option or purchase rights, conversion or exchange rights,
call, commitment or claim of any right, title or interest therein or thereto.
The outstanding capital stock of the Borrower and each Subsidiary of the
Borrower is duly authorized, validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable.

transactions contemplated thereby do not and will not (i) constitute a tortious
interference with any Contractual Obligation of the Borrower or any of its
Subsidiaries to any Person, or (ii) conflict with or violate such Loan Party's
certificate or articles of incorporation or bylaws, or other organizational
documents, as the case may be, or (iii) conflict with, result in a breach of or
constitute (with or without notice or lapse of time or both) a default under any
material Requirement of Law or material Contractual Obligation of the Borrower
or any of its Subsidiaries, or require termination of any material Contractual
Obligation of any such Person (other than the Existing Credit Agreement and the
Contractual Obligations relating thereto), or (iv) result in or require the
creation or imposition of any Lien whatsoever upon any of the properties or
assets of the Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries (other than Liens in favor of
the Agent arising pursuant to the Loan Documents or Liens permitted pursuant to
Section 6.02(a)), or (v) require any approval of stockholders or any approval or
consent of any Person under any Contractual Obligation of any Loan Party, except
for corporate authorizations described in Section 5.01(b) which have been
obtained and are in full force and effect on the Closing Date.

          (E) GOVERNMENTAL CONSENTS.  The execution, delivery and performance by
              ---------------------

          (G) FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND CONDITION.  Complete and accurate copies
              ----------------------------------                               
of the following financial statements and materials have been delivered to each
of the Lenders: the Annual Report of the Borrower on Form 10-K for Fiscal Year
1993 (including audited financial statements) and the Quarterly Report of the
Borrower on Form 10-Q for each of the first three quarters of Fiscal Year 1994.
All financial statements included in such materials furnished to any Lender, and
all Annual Reports of the Borrower on Form 10-K and Quarterly Reports of the
Borrower on Form 10-Q delivered after the Closing Date, were prepared in
conformity with GAAP consistently applied, except as otherwise noted therein,
and fairly present the Consolidated financial position of the Borrower and its
Subsidiaries as at the respective dates thereof and the Consolidated results of
operations and statement of cash flows of the Borrower and its Subsidiaries for
each of the periods covered thereby, subject, in the case of any unaudited
interim financial statements, to changes resulting from audit and normal year-
end adjustments.

          (H) DEBT.  Set forth on Schedule 5.01(h) hereto is a complete and
              ----                                                         
accurate list of all Surviving Debt, showing as of the date hereof the principal
amount outstanding thereunder for each issue of Debt having an outstanding
principal amount in excess of $250,000.

          (I) SOLVENCY.  Each Loan Party is, individually and together with its
              --------                                                         
Subsidiaries, Solvent.

          (J) LITIGATION; ADVERSE EFFECT.  There is no action, suit, proceeding,
              --------------------------                                        
governmental investigation or arbitration, at law or in equity, or before or by
any Governmental Authority, pending, or to the knowledge of the Borrower,
threatened against the Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries or any property of
any of them which has had or is reasonably likely to have a Material Adverse
Effect.  Neither the Borrower nor any of its Subsidiaries is (i) in violation of
any applicable law which violation has had or is reasonably likely to have a
Material Adverse Effect, or (ii) subject to or in default with respect to any
final judgment, writ, order, injunction, decree, rule or regulation of any court
or Governmental Authority which has had or is reasonably likely to have a
Material Adverse Effect.

          (K) NO MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT; ADVERSE AGREEMENTS.  Since October 31,
              ----------------------------------------------                    
1993, after giving effect to this Agreement and the transactions contemplated by
the Loan Documents, there has occurred no event which has had or is reasonably
likely to have a Material Adverse Effect.  Neither the Borrower nor any
Subsidiary of the Borrower is a party to or subject to any Contractual
Obligation or other restriction contained in their respective charters, bylaws,
partnership documents or similar governing documents which has had or is
reasonably likely to have a Material Adverse Effect.

          (L) TAX EXAMINATIONS.  As of the date hereof, the Federal income tax
              ----------------                                                
returns of the Borrower for the fiscal years ended (i) October 31, 1986 and
prior have been examined by the IRS and are closed by the applicable statutes of
limitations, (ii) October 31, 1987 and 1988 have been examined by the IRS and a
protest has been filed with the Appeals Division of the IRS to protest certain
adjustments proposed by the IRS, (iii) October 31, 1989, 1990, 1991, and 1992
have been examined by the IRS and the changes have been accepted by the
Borrower, and (iv) October 31, 1993 has not been examined by the IRS; this
return will be subject to review by the Joint Committee of Congress due to the
net operating loss carryback to the fiscal year ended October 31, 1990.  All
deficiencies which have been asserted against the Borrower as a result of such
examinations have been fully paid or finally settled or are being contested in
good faith, and no issue has been raised in any such examinations which, by
application of similar principles, reasonably can be expected to result in
assertion of a material deficiency for any other year not so examined that has
not been accrued on the Borrower's audited financial statements for its Fiscal
Year ended October 31, 1993 that would be required to be so accrued in
accordance with GAAP. The Borrower does not anticipate any further material tax
liability with respect to any years which have


                                      39
<PAGE>
 
not been closed, taken as a whole.  The Borrower has no knowledge of any
material Federal income tax liability with respect to open taxable years in
excess of amounts accrued on the Borrower's audited financial statements which
would be required to be so accrued in accordance with GAAP.  For purposes of
this Section, the term "THE BORROWER" shall include each other corporation with
                        ------------                                           
which the Borrower files consolidated or combined income tax returns or reports.

          (M) PAYMENT OF TAXES.  All federal and state income tax returns of the
              ----------------                                                  
Borrower and all other material tax returns and reports of the Borrower and each
Subsidiary of the Borrower required to be filed, have been timely filed, and all
taxes, assessments, fees and other governmental charges thereupon and upon their
respective properties, assets, income and franchises which are shown on such
returns as being due and payable, have been paid when due and payable, except
such taxes, if any, that are reserved against in accordance with GAAP, such
taxes as are being contested in good faith by appropriate proceedings or such
taxes the failure to make payment of which when due and payable would not have,
in the aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect.  The Borrower has no knowledge of
any proposed tax assessment against it or any of its Subsidiaries that is
reasonably likely to have a Material Adverse Effect.

          (N) PERFORMANCE OF CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS.  Neither the Borrower nor
              --------------------------------------                           
any Subsidiary of the Borrower is in default in the performance, observance or
fulfillment of any of the obligations, covenants or conditions contained in any
Contractual Obligation applicable to it, and no condition exists which, with the
giving of notice or the lapse of time or both, would constitute a default under
such Contractual Obligation, except, in any such case, where the consequences,
direct or indirect, of such default or defaults, if any, would not have or are
not reasonably likely to have a Material Adverse Effect.

          (O) MARGIN STOCK.  Neither the Borrower nor any of its Subsidiaries is
              ------------                                                      
engaged in the business of extending credit for the purpose of purchasing or
carrying any Margin Stock.  Following application of the proceeds of each
Advance, not more than 25 percent of the value of the assets (either of the
Borrower only or of the Borrower and its Subsidiaries on a Consolidated basis)
subject to the provisions of Section 6.02(a) or 6.02(e) or subject to any
restriction contained in any agreement or instrument between the Borrower and
any Lender or any Affiliate of any Lender relating to Debt and within the scope
of Section 7.01(e) will be Margin Stock.

          (P) DISCLOSURE.  Neither the Information Memorandum nor the schedules,
              ----------                                                        
certificates and other written statements and materials and information
furnished by or on behalf of the Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries to the
Agent and the Lenders contain any material misstatement of fact or omit to state
a material fact necessary in order to make the statements contained therein, in
light of the circumstances under which they were made and taken as a whole, not
misleading.  Neither the Borrower nor any of its Subsidiaries has intentionally
withheld any fact known to it which has had or is reasonably likely to have a
Material Adverse Effect which has not been set forth or referred to in this
Agreement, the other Loan Documents, or such schedules, certificates, statements
or information furnished to the Agent and the Lenders.

          (Q) REQUIREMENTS OF LAW.  The Borrower and each of its Subsidiaries is
              -------------------                                               
in compliance with all Requirements of Law (including, without limitation, the
Securities Act and the Securities Exchange Act, and the applicable rules and
regulations thereunder, state securities laws and "blue sky" laws) applicable to
                                                   --------                     
them and their respective businesses, in each case, where the failure to so
comply would have or is reasonably likely to have a Material Adverse Effect.

          (R) INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY.  The Borrower and each of its Subsidiaries

and other governmental approvals, patents, trademarks, trade names, copyrights,
technology, know-how and processes used in or necessary for the conduct of their
businesses as currently conducted which are material to their condition
(financial or otherwise), operations, performance and prospects, taken as a
whole.  The use of such permits and other governmental approvals, patents,
trademarks, trade names, copyrights, technology, know-how and processes by the
Borrower and each of its Subsidiaries does not infringe on the rights of any
Person, subject to such claims and infringements as do not, in the aggregate,
give rise to any liability on the part of the Borrower or any of its
Subsidiaries which has or is reasonably likely to have a Material Adverse
Effect.

          (S) ENVIRONMENTAL MATTERS.
              ---------------------

     and are in effect for the operations and properties of the Borrower and its
     Subsidiaries and the Borrower and its Subsidiaries are in compliance in all
     material respects with all such Environmental Permits, and (B) no
     circumstances exist that would be reasonably likely to (1) form the basis
     of an Environmental Action against the Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries
     or any of their properties that would be reasonably likely to have a
     Material Adverse Effect or (2) cause any such property to be subject to any
     restrictions on ownership, occupancy, use or transferability under any
     Environmental Law that would be reasonably likely to have a Material
     Adverse Effect.

              (ii)   Except as has not had and is not reasonably likely to have
     a Material Adverse Effect, none of the properties of the Borrower or any of
     its Subsidiaries is listed or, to the Borrower's knowledge, is proposed for
     listing on the National Priorities List under CERCLA or on the
     Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability
     Information System maintained by the Environmental Protection Agency or any
     analogous state list of sites requiring investigation or cleanup or is
     adjacent to any such property, and no underground storage tanks, as such
     term is defined in 42 U.S.C.(S) 6991, are located on any property of the
     Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries or, to the Borrower's knowledge, on any
     adjoining property.

              (iii)  Except as has not had and is not reasonably likely to have
     a Material Adverse Effect, neither the Borrower nor any of its Subsidiaries
     has transported or arranged for the transportation of any Hazardous
     Materials to any location that is listed or proposed for listing on the
     National Priorities List under CERCLA or on the Comprehensive Environmental
     Response, Compensation and Liability Information System maintained by the
     Environmental Protection Agency or any analogous state list, Hazardous
     Materials have not been generated, used, treated, handled, stored or
     disposed of on, or released or transported to or from, any property of the
     Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries or, to the Borrower's knowledge, any
     adjoining property, except in compliance with all Environmental Laws and
     Environmental Permits, and all other wastes generated at any such
     properties have been disposed of in compliance with all Environmental Laws
     and Environmental Permits.

          (T) ERISA MATTERS.
              ------------- 

              (i)   No ERISA Event has occurred or is reasonably expected to
     occur with respect to any Plan of any Loan Party or any of its ERISA
     Affiliates that has resulted in or is reasonably likely to result in a
     material liability of any Loan Party or any of its ERISA Affiliates.

              (ii)  Schedule B (Actuarial Information) to the 1993 annual
     report (Form 5500 Series) for each Plan of any Loan Party or any of its
     ERISA Affiliates, copies of which have been filed with the Internal Revenue
     Service, is complete and accurate and fairly presents the funding status of
     such Plan, and since the date of such Schedule B there has been no adverse
     change in such funding status that has had or would be reasonably likely to
     have a Material Adverse Effect.

              (iii) Neither any Loan Party nor any of its ERISA Affiliates has
     incurred or is reasonably expected to incur any Withdrawal Liability to any
     Multiemployer Plan in an amount which has had or would be reasonably likely

              (iv)  Neither any Loan Party nor any of its ERISA Affiliates has
     been notified by the sponsor of a Multiemployer Plan of any Loan Party or
     any of its ERISA Affiliates that such Multiemployer Plan is in
     reorganization or has been terminated, within the meaning of Title IV of
     ERISA, and to the best knowledge of any Loan Party and any of its ERISA
     Affiliates, no such Multiemployer Plan is reasonably expected to be in
     reorganization or to be terminated, within the meaning of Title IV of
     ERISA, in each case except for any such reorganization or termination which
     would not be reasonably likely to have a Material Adverse Effect.

              (v)   Except as set forth in the financial statements referred to
     in Sections 5.01 and 6.03, the Borrower and its Subsidiaries have no

Contractual Obligation to which the Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries is a

Agent by it, and all such Collateral is free and clear of all Liens except Liens
permitted by Section 6.02(a).

          (W) INVESTMENTS.  Set forth on Schedule 5.01(w) hereto is a complete
              -----------

consent, of the Required Lenders, by notice to the Borrower, declare the Total
Commitments and the obligation of each Lender to make Advances and of each
Issuing Bank to issue Letters of Credit to be terminated, whereupon the same
shall forthwith terminate, and (ii) shall at the request, or may with the
consent, of the Required Lenders, by notice to the Borrower, declare the Notes,
if any, the Advances, all interest thereon and all other amounts payable under
this Agreement and the other Loan Documents to be forthwith due and payable,
whereupon any such Notes, all outstanding Advances, all such interest and all
such amounts shall become and be forthwith due and payable, without presentment,
demand, protest or further notice of any kind, all of which are hereby expressly
waived by the Borrower; provided, however, that in the event of an actual or
                        --------  -------                                   
deemed entry of an order for relief with respect to any Loan Party or any of its
Subsidiaries under the Federal Bankruptcy Code, (x) the Total Commitments and
the obligation of each Lender to make Advances and of each Issuing Bank to issue
Letters of Credit shall automatically be terminated and (y) the Notes, if any,
all outstanding Advances, all such interest and all such amounts shall
automatically become and be due and payable, without presentment, demand,
protest or any notice of any kind, all of which are hereby expressly waived by
the Borrower.

          SECTION 7.02.  ACTIONS IN RESPECT OF THE LETTERS OF CREDIT UPON

DEFAULT.  If any Event of Default shall have occurred and be continuing, the
- - -------                                                                     
Agent may, irrespective of whether it is taking any of the actions described in
Section 7.01 or otherwise, make demand upon the Borrower to, and forthwith upon
such demand the Borrower will, pay to the Agent on behalf of the Lenders in same
day funds at the Agent's office designated in such demand, for deposit in the
L/C Cash Collateral Account, an amount equal to the aggregate Available Amount
of all Letters of Credit then outstanding.  If at any time the Agent determines
that any funds held in the L/C Cash Collateral Account are subject to any right
or claim of any Person other than the Agent and the Lenders or that the total
amount of such funds is less than the aggregate Available Amount of all Letters
of Credit, the Borrower will, forthwith upon demand by the Agent, pay to the
Agent, as additional funds to be deposited and held in the L/C Cash Collateral
Account, an amount equal to the excess of (a) such aggregate Available Amount
over (b) the total amount of funds, if any, then held in the L/C Cash Collateral
Account that the Agent determines to be free and clear of any such right and
claim.

                                 ARTICLE VIII

                                  THE AGENT

          SECTION 8.01.  AUTHORIZATION AND ACTION.  Each Lender hereby appoints
                         ------------------------                              
and authorizes the Agent to enter into the Collateral Documents and to take such
action as agent on its behalf and to exercise such powers and discretion under
this Agreement and the other Loan Documents as are delegated to the Agent by the
terms hereof and thereof, together with such powers and discretion as are
reasonably incidental thereto.  As to any matters not expressly provided for by
the Loan Documents (including, without limitation, enforcement or collection of
the Notes, if any, and the Debt resulting from the Advances), the Agent shall
not be required to exercise any discretion or take any action, but shall be
required to act or to refrain from acting (and shall be fully protected in so
acting or refraining from acting) upon the instructions of the Required Lenders,
and such instructions shall be binding upon all Lenders and all holders of
Notes; provided, however, that the Agent shall not be required to take any
       --------  -------                                                  
action that exposes the Agent to personal liability or that is contrary to this
Agreement or applicable law.  The Agent agrees to give to each Lender prompt
notice of each notice given to it by the Borrower pursuant to the terms of this
Agreement.

          SECTION 8.02.  AGENT'S RELIANCE, ETC.  Neither the Agent nor any of
                         ---------------------                               
its directors, officers, agents or employees shall be liable for any action
taken or omitted to be taken by it or them under or in connection with the Loan
Documents, except for its or their own gross negligence or willful misconduct.
Without limitation of the generality of the foregoing, the Agent:  (i) may treat
the payee of any Note as the holder thereof and the Lender that made any Advance
as the holder of the Debt resulting therefrom until the Agent receives and
accepts an Assignment and Acceptance entered into by the Lender that is the
payee of such Note and/or such Lender, as the case may be, as assignor, and an
Eligible Assignee, as assignee, as provided in Section 9.07; (ii) may consult
with legal counsel (including counsel for any Loan Party), independent public
accountants and other experts selected by it and shall not be liable for any
action taken  or omitted to be taken in good faith by it in accordance with the
advice of such counsel, accountants or experts; (iii) makes no warranty or
representation to any Lender and shall not be responsible to any Lender for any
statements, warranties or representations made in or in connection with the Loan
Documents; (iv) shall not have any duty to ascertain or to inquire as to the
performance or observance of any of the terms, covenants or conditions of any
Loan Document on the part of any Loan Party or to inspect the property
(including the books and records) of any Loan Party; (v) shall not be
responsible to any Lender for the due execution, legality, validity,
enforceability, genuineness, sufficiency or value of any Loan Document or any
other instrument or document furnished pursuant hereto; and (vi) shall incur no
liability under or in respect of any Loan Document by acting upon any notice,
consent, certificate or other instrument or writing (which may be by telegram,
telecopy, cable or telex) believed by it to be genuine and signed or sent by the
proper party or parties.

          SECTION 8.03.  NATIONSBANK AND AFFILIATES.  With respect to its
                         --------------------------                      
Commitments, and the Advances made by it and the Notes, if any, issued to it,
NationsBank shall have the same rights and powers under the Loan Documents as
any other Lender and may exercise the same as though it were not the Agent; and
the term "Lender" or "Lenders" shall, unless otherwise expressly indicated,
include NationsBank in its individual capacity.  NationsBank and its affiliates
may accept deposits from, lend money to, act as trustee under indentures of,
accept investment banking engagements from and generally engage in any kind of
business with, any Loan Party, any of its Subsidiaries and any Person who may do
business with or own securities of any Loan Party or any such Subsidiary, all as
if NationsBank were not the Agent and without any duty to account therefor to
the Lenders.

          SECTION 8.04.  LENDER CREDIT DECISION.  Each Lender acknowledges that
                         ----------------------                                
it has, independently and without reliance upon the Agent or any other Lender
and based on the financial statements referred to in Section 4.01, Section 5.01
and/or Section 6.03, as the case may be, and such other documents and
information as it has deemed appropriate, made its own credit analysis and
decision to enter into this Agreement.  Each Lender also acknowledges that it
will,  independently and without reliance upon the Agent or any other Lender and
based on such documents and information as it shall deem appropriate at the
time, continue to make its own credit decisions in taking or not taking action
under this Agreement.

          SECTION 8.05.  INDEMNIFICATION.  Each Lender severally agrees to
                         ---------------                                  
indemnify the Agent (to the extent not promptly reimbursed by the Borrower),
from and against such Lender's Pro Rata Share of any and all liabilities,
obligations, losses, damages, penalties, actions, judgments, suits, costs,
expenses or disbursements of any kind or nature whatsoever that may be imposed
on, incurred by, or asserted against the Agent in any way relating to or arising
out of the Loan Documents or any action taken or omitted by the Agent under the
Loan Documents; provided, however, that no Lender shall be liable for any
                --------  -------                                        
portion of such liabilities, obligations, losses, damages, penalties, actions,
judgments, suits, costs, expenses or disbursements resulting solely from the
Agent's gross negligence or willful misconduct.  Without limitation of the
foregoing, each Lender agrees to reimburse the Agent promptly upon demand for
such Lender's Pro Rata Share of any costs and expenses payable by the Borrower
under Section 9.04, to the extent that the Agent is not promptly reimbursed for
such costs and expenses by the Borrower.  The failure of any Lender to reimburse
the Agent promptly upon demand for its ratable share of any amount required to
be paid by the Lenders to the Agent as provided herein shall not relieve any
other Lender of its obligation hereunder to reimburse the Agent for its ratable
share of such amount, but no Lender shall be responsible for the failure of any
other Lender to reimburse the Agent for such other Lender's ratable share of
such amount.

          SECTION 8.06.  SUCCESSOR AGENTS.  The Agent may resign at any time by
                         ----------------                                      
giving written notice thereof to the Lenders and the Borrower and the Agent may
be removed at any time by written notice with or without cause by the Required
Lenders.  Upon any such resignation or removal, the Required Lenders shall have
the right to appoint a successor Agent; provided, however, that so long as no
                                        --------  -------                    
Event of Default has occurred and is continuing, the Borrower shall have the
right to approve any such successor Agent, such approval not to be unreasonably
withheld or delayed.  If no successor Agent shall have been so appointed by the
Required Lenders (and approved by the Borrower, if applicable), and shall have
accepted such appointment, within 30 days after the retiring Agent's giving of
notice of resignation or the Required Lenders' removal of the retiring Agent,
then the retiring Agent may, on behalf of the Lenders, appoint a successor
Agent, which shall be a commercial bank organized under the laws of the United
States or of any State thereof and having a combined capital and surplus of at
least $500,000,000; provided, however, that so long as no Event of Default has
                    --------  -------                                         
occurred and is continuing, the Borrower shall have the right to approve any
such successor Agent, such approval not to be unreasonably withheld or delayed.
Upon the acceptance of any appointment as Agent hereunder by a successor Agent
and upon the execution and filing or recording of such financing statements, or
amendments thereto and such other instruments or notices, as may be necessary or
desirable, or as the Required Lenders may request, in order to continue the
perfection of the Liens granted or purported to be granted by the Collateral
Documents, such successor Agent shall succeed to and become vested with all the
rights, powers, discretion, privileges and duties of the retiring Agent, and the
retiring Agent shall be discharged from its duties and obligations under the
Loan Documents. After any retiring Agent's resignation or removal hereunder as
Agent, the provisions of this Article VIII shall inure to its benefit as to any
actions taken or omitted to be taken by it while it was Agent under this
Agreement.

of this Agreement, the Notes, if any, or any other Loan Document nor consent to
any departure by the Borrower therefrom, shall in any event be effective unless
the same shall be in writing and signed by the Borrower and the Required
Lenders, and then such waiver or consent shall be effective only in the specific
instance and for the specific purpose for which given; provided, however, that
                                                       --------  -------
(i) no amendment, waiver or consent shall, unless in writing and signed by the 
Borrower and all the Lenders, do any of the following at any time: (A) change
the percentage of the Commitments or of the aggregate unpaid principal amount of
the Notes, if any, and Advances, or the number of Lenders, that shall be
required for the Lenders or any of them to take any action hereunder, (B) amend
this Section 9.01, (C) subject the Lenders to any additional obligations, (D)
reduce the principal of, or interest on, the Notes or Advances or any fees or
other amounts payable hereunder, or (E) postpone any date fixed for any payment
of principal of, or interest on, the Notes or Advances or any fees or other
amounts payable hereunder; provided further that no amendment, waiver or consent
                           -------- -------
unless in writing and signed by the L/C Bank and each other Lender that is then
an Issuing Bank, in addition to the Lenders required above to take such action,
affect the rights or obligations of the Issuing Banks under this Agreement; and
provided further that no amendment, waiver or consent shall, unless in writing
- - -------- -------
and signed by the Agent in addition to the Lenders required above to take such
action, affect the rights or duties of the Agent under this Agreement or any
Note or any other Loan Documents.

                (B) RELEASE OF COLLATERAL.  So long as no Default under Section
                    ---------------------                                      
7.01(a) or (f) and no Event of Default has occurred and is continuing: (i) upon
the request of the Borrower, and without the consent of the Lenders or the
Required Lenders, the Agent is authorized to (A) release from the Lien of any
Collateral Document any item or items of Collateral comprising less than all or
substantially all of the Collateral at the time of such release (and, if such
Collateral consists of all of the Borrower's or any of its Subsidiaries'
interest in any Guarantor, to simultaneously release such Guarantor from its
obligations under the Guaranty and the Collateral Documents) and (B) to execute
any documents or instruments reasonably requested by the Borrower (as determined
by the Agent) in connection therewith, but in each case only if (A) such release
is requested in conjunction with the consummation of any sale or other
disposition of such Collateral by the Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries (or
the creation of any Lien) that is not prohibited by this Agreement, and (B) the
Borrower has delivered to the Agent (which shall deliver a copy to each Lender)
an Officers' Certificate certifying that no Default under Section 7.01(a) or (f)
or Event of Default has occurred and is continuing and that such sale or other
disposition (or such creation of a Lien) is not prohibited by this Agreement.

                SECTION 9.02.  NOTICES, ETC.  Except as otherwise expressly 
                               ------------

Lender or the Agent to exercise, and no delay in exercising, any right hereunder
or under any Note shall operate as a waiver thereof; nor shall any single or

cumulative and not exclusive of any remedies provided by law.

          SECTION 9.04.  COSTS, EXPENSES.  (a)  The Borrower agrees to pay on

Documents, whether in any action, suit or litigation, any bankruptcy, insolvency
or other similar proceeding affecting creditors' rights generally or otherwise
(including, without limitation, the reasonable fees and expenses of counsel for
the Agent and each Lender with respect thereto).

          (b) The Borrower agrees to indemnify and hold harmless the Agent and

          (c) If any payment of principal of, or Conversion of, any Eurodollar
Rate Advance is made by the Borrower to or for the account of a Lender other
than on the last day of the Interest Period for such Advance, as a result of a
prepayment pursuant to Section 2.05, a payment or Conversion pursuant to Section
2.06 or 2.08, acceleration of the maturity of the Notes or Advances pursuant to
Section 7.01 or for any other reason, or by an Eligible Assignee to a Lender
other than on the last day of the Interest Period for such Advance upon an
assignment of rights and obligations under this Agreement pursuant to Section
9.07 as a result of a demand by the Borrower pursuant to Section 9.07(a), the
Borrower shall, upon demand by such Lender (with a copy of such demand to the
Agent), pay to the Agent for the account of such Lender any amounts required to
compensate such Lender for any additional losses, costs or expenses that it may
reasonably incur as a result of such payment, including, without limitation, any
loss (including loss of anticipated profits), cost or expense incurred by reason
of the liquidation or reemployment of deposits or other funds acquired by any
Lender to fund or maintain such Advance.  A certificate as to such amounts
submitted to the Borrower and the Agent by such Lender shall be conclusive and
binding for all purposes, absent manifest error.  Any calculation or
determination under Sections 2.06, 2.08 4.08 or this Section 9.04(c) shall be
made on the assumption that each Lender has funded or will fund each Eurodollar
Rate Advance in the applicable interbank market, provided that each such Lender
shall be under no obligation to actually fund any Eurodollar Rate Advance in
such manner.

          (d) Anything contained herein to the contrary notwithstanding, if any
Lender has sold a participation in any of its rights or obligations hereunder
and is entitled to any compensation, reimbursement or other payment under
Section 2.06, 2.08, 2.10, or this Section 9.04, the amount payable to such
Lender shall be determined and calculated as though no such participation had
been sold.

          SECTION 9.05.  RIGHT OF SET-OFF.  Upon (a) the occurrence and during
                         ----------------                                     
the continuance of any Event of Default and (b) the making of the request or the
granting of the consent specified by Section 7.01 to authorize the Agent to
declare the Notes and Advances due and payable pursuant to the provisions of
Section 7.01, each Lender and each of is Affiliates is hereby authorized at any
time and from time to time, to the fullest extent permitted by law, to set off
and otherwise apply any and all deposits (general or special, time or demand,
provisional or final) at any time held and other indebtedness at any time owing
by such Lender or such Affiliate to or for the credit or the account of the
Borrower against any and all of the Obligations of the Borrower now or hereafter
existing under this Agreement and the Note or Notes, if any, held by such
Lender, irrespective of whether such Lender shall have made any demand under
this Agreement or any such Note or Notes and although such obligations may be
unmatured.  Each Lender agrees promptly to notify the Borrower after any such
set-off and application; provided, however, that the failure to give such notice
                         --------  -------                                      
shall not, to the fullest extent permitted by law, affect the validity of such
set-off and application.  The rights of each Lender and its Affiliates under
this Section are in addition to other rights and remedies (including, without
limitation, other rights of set-off) that such Lender and its Affiliates may
have.

          SECTION 9.06.  BINDING EFFECT.  This Agreement shall become effective
                         --------------                                        
when it shall have been executed by the Borrower and the Agent and when the
Agent shall have been notified by each Initial Lender that such Initial Lender
has executed it and thereafter shall be binding upon and inure to the benefit of
the Borrower, the Agent and each Lender and their respective successors and
assigns, except that the Borrower shall not have the right to assign its rights
hereunder or any interest herein without the prior written consent of the
Lenders.

          SECTION 9.07.  ASSIGNMENTS AND PARTICIPATIONS.  (a)  Each Lender may
                         ------------------------------                       
and, if demanded by the Borrower (following a demand by such Lender for
compensation pursuant to Section 2.08 or 2.10 upon at least 10 Business Days'
notice to such Lender and the Agent), will, assign to one

                                      62

Commitments and the Advances owing to it and the Note or Notes, if any, held by
it); provided, however, that (i) each such assignment shall be of a uniform, and
     --------  -------                                                          
not a varying, percentage of all rights and obligations under and in respect of
all of the Facilities, (ii) except in the case of an assignment to a Person

the rights and obligations of the assigning Lender under this Agreement or an
assignment of a portion of such rights and obligations made concurrently with
another such assignment or other such assignments that together cover all of the
rights and obligations of the assigning Lender under this Agreement, (v) no
Lender shall be obligated to make any such assignment as a result of a demand by

accrued interest thereon to the date of payment of such principal amount and all
other amounts payable to such Lender under this Agreement, and (vi) the parties
to each such assignment shall execute and deliver to the Agent, for its

Acceptance, (x) the assignee thereunder shall be a party hereto and, to the
extent that rights and obligations hereunder have been assigned to it pursuant
to such Assignment and Acceptance, have the rights and obligations of a Lender
hereunder and (y) the Lender assignor thereunder shall, to the extent that

and obligations under this Agreement, such Lender shall cease to be a party
hereto).

          (b) By executing and delivering an Assignment and Acceptance, the
Lender assignor thereunder and the assignee thereunder confirm to and agree with
each other and the other parties hereto as follows:  (i) other than as provided
in such Assignment and Acceptance, such assigning Lender makes no representation

the execution, legality, validity, enforceability, genuineness, sufficiency or
value of this Agreement or any other instrument or document furnished pursuant

such assignee appoints and authorizes the Agent to take such action as agent on

<PAGE>
 
together with such powers and discretion as are reasonably incidental thereto;
and (vii) such assignee agrees that it will perform in accordance with their
terms all of the obligations that by the terms of this Agreement are required to
be performed by it as a Lender.

          (c) The Agent shall maintain at its address referred to in Section
9.02 a copy of each Assignment and Acceptance delivered to and accepted by it
and a register for the recordation of the names and addresses of the Lenders and
the Commitment of, and principal amount of the Advances owing to, each Lender
from time to time (the "REGISTER").  The entries in the Register shall be
                        --------                                         
conclusive and binding for all purposes, absent manifest error, and the
Borrower, the Agent and the Lenders may treat each Person whose name is recorded
in the Register as a Lender hereunder for all purposes of this Agreement.  The
Register shall be available for inspection by the Borrower or any Lender at any
reasonable time and from time to time upon reasonable prior notice.

          (d) Upon its receipt of an Assignment and Acceptance executed by an
assigning Lender and an assignee, together with any Note or Notes subject to
such assignment, the Agent shall, if such Assignment and Acceptance has been
completed and is in substantially the form of Exhibit D hereto, (i) accept such
Assignment and Acceptance, (ii) record the information contained therein in the
Register and (iii) give prompt notice thereof to the Borrower.  Within five
Business Days after its receipt of such notice, the Borrower, at its own
expense, shall, if so requested in writing, execute and deliver to the Agent in
exchange for any surrendered Note or Notes a new Note or new Notes to the order
of such Eligible Assignee in an amount equal to the Commitments assumed by it
pursuant to such Assignment and Acceptance and, if the assigning Lender has
retained a Commitment hereunder, a new Note or New Notes to the order of the
assigning Lender in an amount equal to the Commitments retained by it hereunder.
Such new Note or Notes shall be in an aggregate principal amount equal to the
aggregate principal amount of such surrendered Note or Notes, shall be dated the
effective date of such Assignment and Acceptance and shall otherwise be in
substantially the form of the applicable Exhibit hereto.

          (e) Each Lender may sell participations in or to all or a portion of
its rights and obligations under this Agreement (including, without limitation,
all or a portion of its Commitments, the Advances owing to it and any Note or
Notes held by it); provided, however, that (i) such Lender's obligations under
                   --------  -------                                          
this Agreement (including, without limitation, its Commitments) shall remain
unchanged, (ii) such Lender shall remain solely responsible to the other parties
hereto for the performance of such obligations, (iii) such Lender shall remain
the holder of any such Note and such Advances for all purposes of this
Agreement, (iv) the Borrower, the Agent and the other Lenders shall continue to
deal solely and directly with such Lender in connection with such Lender's
rights and obligations under this Agreement and (v) no participant under any
such participation shall have any right to approve any amendment or waiver of
any provision of any Loan Document, or any consent to any departure by any Loan
Party therefrom, except to the extent that such amendment, waiver or consent
would reduce the principal of, or interest on, the Notes or Advances or any fees
or other amounts payable hereunder, in each case to the extent subject to such
participation, or postpone any date fixed for any payment of principal of, or
interest on, the Notes or Advances or any fees or other amounts payable
hereunder, in each case to the extent subject to such participation.

          (f) Any Lender may, in connection with any assignment or participation
or proposed assignment or participation pursuant to this Section 9.07, disclose
to the assignee or participant or proposed assignee or participant, any
information relating to the Borrower and its Subsidiaries furnished to such
Lender by or on behalf of the Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries; provided,
                                                                   -------- 
however, that, prior to any such disclosure, the assignee or participant or
- - -------                                                                    
proposed assignee or participant shall agree to

                                      64

preserve (in accordance with Section 9.16) the confidentiality of any
Confidential Information received by it from such Lender.

          (g) Notwithstanding any other provision set forth in this Agreement,
any Lender may at any time create a security interest in all or any portion of
its rights under this Agreement (including, without limitation, the Advances
owing to it and any Note or Notes held by it) in favor of any Federal Reserve
Bank in accordance with Regulation A of the Board of Governors of the Federal
Reserve System.

          SECTION 9.08.  GOVERNING LAW.  This Agreement and the Notes, if any,
                         -------------                                        
shall be governed by, and construed in accordance with, the laws of the State of
New York.

          SECTION 9.09.  EXECUTION IN COUNTERPARTS.  This Agreement may be
                         -------------------------                        
executed in any number of counterparts and by different parties hereto in
separate counterparts, each of  which when so executed shall be deemed to be an
original and all of which taken together shall constitute one and the same
agreement.  Delivery of an executed counterpart of a signature page to this
Agreement by telecopier shall be effective as delivery of a manually executed
counterpart of this Agreement.

          SECTION 9.10.  NO LIABILITY OF THE ISSUING BANKS.  The Borrower
                         ---------------------------------               
assumes all risks of the acts or omissions of any beneficiary or transferee of
any Letter of Credit with respect to its use of such Letter of Credit.  Neither
any Issuing Bank nor any of its officers or directors shall be liable or
responsible for:  (a) the use that may be made of any Letter of Credit or any
acts or omissions of any beneficiary or transferee in connection therewith; (b)
the validity, sufficiency or genuineness of documents, or of any endorsement
thereon, even if such documents should prove to be in any or all respects
invalid, insufficient, fraudulent or forged; (c) payment by such Issuing Bank
against presentation of documents that do not comply with the terms of a Letter
of Credit, including failure of any documents to bear any reference or adequate
reference to the Letter of Credit; or (d) any other circumstances whatsoever in
making or failing to make payment under any Letter of Credit, except that the
                                                              ------         
Borrower shall have a claim against such Issuing Bank, and such Issuing Bank
shall be liable to the Borrower, to the extent of any direct, but not
consequential, damages suffered by the Borrower that the Borrower proves were
caused solely by (i) such Issuing Bank's willful misconduct or gross negligence
in determining whether documents presented under any Letter of Credit comply
with the terms of the Letter of Credit or (ii) such Issuing Bank's willful
failure to make lawful payment under a Letter of Credit after the presentation
to it of a draft and certificates strictly complying with the terms and
conditions of the Letter of Credit.  In furtherance and not in limitation of the
foregoing, such Issuing Bank may accept documents that appear on their face to
be in order, without responsibility for further investigation, regardless of any
notice or information to the contrary.

          SECTION 9.11.  CHANGE IN ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES.  Except as otherwise
                         -------------------------------                      
provided herein, if any changes in accounting principles from those used in the
preparation of the financial statements referred to in Section 5.01(g) are
hereafter required or permitted by the rules, regulations, pronouncements and
opinions of the Financial Accounting Standards Board or the American Institute
of Certified Public Accountants (or successors thereto or agencies with similar
functions) and are adopted by the Borrower with the agreement of its independent
certified public accountants and such changes result in a change in the method
of calculation of any of the financial covenants, standards or terms found in
Sections 6.02 or 6.04, the parties hereto agree to enter into negotiations in
order to amend such provisions so as to reflect equitably such changes with the
desired result that the criteria for evaluating the Borrower's financial
condition shall be the same after such changes as if such changes had not been
made; provided, that no change in generally accepted accounting principles that
      --------                                                                 
would affect the method of calculation of any of the financial covenants,
standards or terms shall be given effect in such

                                      65
<PAGE>
 
calculations until such provisions are amended, in a manner satisfactory to the
Required Lenders, to so reflect such change in accounting principles.

          SECTION 9.12.  LIMITATION OF LIABILITY.  No claim may be made by the
                         -----------------------                              
Borrower, any Lender or any other Person against the Agent, or any Lender or the
Affiliates, directors, officers, employees, or agents of any of them for any
special, indirect, consequential or punitive damages in respect of any claim for
breach of contract or any other theory of liability arising out of or related to
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, or any act, omission or event
occurring in connection therewith, and the Borrower and each Lender hereby

COURTS IN ANY SUCH ACTION OR PROCEEDING BY THE MAILING OF COPIES THEREOF BY

WAIVES, TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, ANY OBJECTION
(INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION, ANY OBJECTION TO THE LAYING OF VENUE OR BASED ON
THE GROUNDS OF FORUM NON CONVENIENS) WHICH IT MAY NOW OR HEREAFTER HAVE TO THE
BRINGING OF ANY SUCH ACTION OR PROCEEDING WITH RESPECT TO THIS AGREEMENT OR ANY
OTHER LOAN DOCUMENT IN ANY JURISDICTION SET FORTH ABOVE.  NOTHING HEREIN SHALL
AFFECT THE RIGHT TO SERVE PROCESS IN ANY OTHER MANNER PERMITTED BY LAW OR SHALL
LIMIT THE RIGHT OF ANY LENDER TO BRING PROCEEDINGS AGAINST THE BORROWER IN THE
COURTS OF ANY OTHER JURISDICTION.

          SECTION 9.14.  PERFORMANCE OF OBLIGATIONS.  The Borrower agrees that
                         --------------------------                           
the Agent may, but shall have no obligation to, make any payment or perform any
act required of the Borrower under any Loan Document or take any other action
which the Agent in its discretion deems necessary or desirable to protect or
preserve the Collateral, including, without limitation, any action to (a) pay or
discharge taxes, liens, security interests or other encumbrances levied or
placed on or threatened against any Collateral and (b) effect any repairs or

Obligations hereunder and shall be repaid by the Borrower on demand with
interest from the date of disbursement by the Agent to the date of payment by
the Borrower accrued at the rate applicable at the time interest accrues to a
Borrowing of Base Rate Advances.

any conditions precedent to the disbursement of any Advances, the Borrower's
performance of any of its covenants, agreements and obligations under the Loan
Documents, or the validity of any representations and warranties made by the
Borrower under the Loan Documents (regardless of whether or not the party
conducting such review, investigation or inspection should have discovered that
any of such conditions precedent were not satisfied or that any such covenants,
agreements or obligations were not performed or that any such representations or
warranties were not true) shall not affect (or constitute a waiver by the
Lenders of) (a) any of the representations and warranties made by the Borrower

accordance with safe and sound banking practices and will use such information

                         ----------------

          (1) The Agent, the Company, and the Lenders have entered into a Credit
Agreement dated as of January 23, 1995 (said Agreement, as it may hereafter be
amended or otherwise modified from time to time, being the "CREDIT AGREEMENT",

the terms defined therein and not otherwise defined herein being used herein as
therein defined), pursuant to which Lenders have agreed, among other things, and
subject to the terms and conditions set forth in the Credit Agreement, to make

Company under the Credit Agreement.

                                                            --------------

of said Schedule I and issued by the obligors named therein, in each case to the
extent such Pledged Shares and Pledged Debt are attributed on such Schedule to
the ownership of such Grantor.

          (4) It is a condition precedent to the making of Advances and the
issuance of Letters of Credit by the Lenders under the Credit Agreement that
each Grantor shall have granted the assignment and security interest and made
the pledge and assignment contemplated by this Agreement.

               Authority, or at all; provided, however, that if such

               other rights or remedies hereunder as to which such consent is
               required; and

               such property or any rights relating thereto expressly prohibit
               the granting of a security interest therein or condition the
               granting of a security interest therein on the consent of a third
               party whose consent has not been obtained or would cause, or
               allow a third party to cause, the forfeiture of such property
               upon the granting of a security interest therein; provided,
                                                                 --------

               consent relates only to the foreclosure of a security interest or
               the exercise of other rights or remedies upon a default, then a
               security interest in such property shall be deemed to be granted
               by this Agreement subject to the condition that the consent of
               such third party is obtained by the Agent prior to foreclosure or
               exercising of its other rights or remedies hereunder as to which
               such consent is required.

          In the event of the termination or elimination of any prohibition or
the requirement for any consent contained in any law, rule, regulation,
agreement, document or instrument to the extent sufficient to permit any
Excluded Property to become Collateral hereunder, or upon the granting of any
such consent, or waiving or terminating any requirement for such consent, a
security interest in such Excluded Property shall be automatically and
simultaneously granted hereunder in such Excluded Property, and the Excluded
Property automatically and simultaneously shall be deemed to be assigned and
pledged to the Agent and shall be included as Collateral hereunder.

specified payment date, at stated maturity, by acceleration or otherwise

Code or any similar law) of all Obligations of such Grantor to any Secured Party
now or hereafter existing under the Credit Agreement, this Agreement, the
Guaranty, the Notes, if any, the other Loan Documents and any and all Hedge
Agreements, in each case whether for principal (including reimbursement for
amounts drawn or available to be drawn under Letters of Credit), interest
(including, without limitation, interest that, but for the filing of a petition
in bankruptcy would accrue on such obligations), fees, expenses, increased
costs, indemnification or otherwise (any and all such Obligations being the
"SECURED OBLIGATIONS"); provided that any Hedge Agreement to which a Lender is a

party shall be a Secured Obligation only so long as there are any Borrowings or
Commitments outstanding under the Credit Agreement.  Without limiting the
generality of the foregoing, this Agreement secures the payment of all amounts
that constitute part of the Secured Obligations and would be owed by any Grantor
to the Agent or the Lenders under the Credit Agreement, this Agreement, the

L/C Cash Collateral Account in such Cash Equivalents in the name of the Agent as
the Company may select and the Agent may approve, and (b) invest interest paid
on the Cash Equivalents referred to in clause (a) above, and reinvest other

               (A) All of the Equipment and Inventory are located at the places
     specified in Schedule II hereto, except for (i) Inventory and Equipment in
     transit and (ii) other Collateral with an aggregate value that does not

     the Receivables, and the original copies of each Assigned Agreement and all
     originals of all

                                       6
<PAGE>
 
     chattel paper that evidence Receivables, are located at the address
     specified for such Grantor on Schedule III hereto.  None of the Receivables
     or Agreement Collateral is evidenced by a promissory note or other
     instrument.  Such Grantor's federal tax identification number is as set
     forth on Schedule III.

               (B) Such Grantor is the legal and beneficial owner of the
     Collateral free and clear of any Lien, except for Liens permitted under
     Section 6.02(a) of the Credit Agreement.  No effective financing statement
     or other instrument similar in effect covering all or any part of the
     Collateral is on file in any recording office, except such as may have been
     filed in favor of the Agent relating to this Agreement or any other Loan
     Document and except for liens permitted under Section 6.02(a) of the Credit
     Agreement.  As of the date of this Agreement, such Grantor currently
     conducts business only under its own name and, in certain areas and for
     certain operations, the trade names listed on Schedule IV.  Neither such
     Grantor nor any corporate predecessor has, during the preceding five (5)
     years, been known as or used any other corporate or fictitious name, except
     such names as are disclosed on Schedule IV.

               (C) Such Grantor has exclusive possession and control of the
     Equipment and Inventory of such Grantor except for (i) Equipment leased by
     such Grantor as a lessee and Equipment in the possession and control of

     agreements entered into in the ordinary course of business and consistent
     with past practice, (ii) Equipment and Inventory in transit with common or
     other carriers, and (iii) Equipment and Inventory in the possession of a
     bailee, provided that if any bailee is in possession of Equipment and
             --------                                                     
     Inventory with a value in excess of One Million Dollars ($1,000,000), the
     bailee has been notified by the Grantor of the security interests created
     by this Agreement.

               (D) The Pledged Shares have been duly authorized and validly
     issued and are fully paid and non-assessable.  The Pledged Debt of such
     Grantor, if any, is in all respects what it purports to be and represents
     genuine debt owing to such Grantor arising from bona fide transactions
     completed in accordance with the terms and provisions contained in the
     documents delivered to the Agent with respect thereto.

               (E) The pledge of the Pledged Shares and Pledged Debt, if any,
     pursuant to this Agreement creates a valid and first priority perfected
     security interest in the Pledged Shares and the Pledged Debt, respectively,
     subject only to Liens of the type described in clause (a) or (b) of the
     definition of "Permitted Liens" contained in the Credit Agreement.

               (F) The Pledged Shares constitute, as of the Closing Date, all of
     the issued and outstanding shares of stock of the respective issuers
     thereof indicated on Schedule I hereto and owned by the Grantors, and, as
     of the Closing Date, there is no other class of shares issued and
     outstanding of the respective issuers thereof.  The Pledged Debt
     constitutes, as of the Closing Date, all of the notes and instruments
     payable to or owned by such Grantor, except for notes and instruments with
     an outstanding principal amount of less than One Million Dollars
     ($1,000,000) and except for notes and instruments received in the ordinary
     course of business and which such Grantor is not required to deliver to the
     Agent pursuant to Section 8 hereof or of which the Agent has not at any
     time requested possession and which are not a material portion of the
     Collateral either singly or in the aggregate, and the security interest of
     the Agent therein has been duly perfected with first priority.

               (G) Appropriate financing statements have been filed in the
     necessary jurisdictions (or have been executed and delivered by the
     applicable Grantor in appropriate form for filing in the necessary
     jurisdictions) with respect to the Collateral as to which financing

                                       7
<PAGE>
 
     statements are required to be filed, so that the security interests granted
     pursuant to this Agreement, to the extent they may be perfected by filing
     financing statements in the necessary jurisdictions, constitute (or in the
     case of any such financing statements not yet filed, will constitute upon
     filing thereof) valid, continuing and perfected security interests in and
     liens on the Collateral to the extent a security interest can be created
     therein under the Uniform Commercial Code as in effect in the applicable
     jurisdictions in the United States, securing the payment of the Secured
     Obligations, subject only to Liens of the type described in clause (a) or
     (b) of the definition of "Permitted Liens" contained in the Credit
     Agreement.  All other actions necessary or requested by the Agent to
     perfect and protect such security interest in each item of Collateral
     (including, without limitation, the actions described in clauses (i) and
     (ii) of Section 8(a) to the extent required therein) have been duly taken
     to the extent a security interest can be created therein under the Uniform
     Commercial Code as in effect in the applicable jurisdictions of the United
     States.

               (H) No authorization, approval or other action by, and no notice
     to or filing with, any Governmental Authority (other than such
     authorizations, approvals and other actions as have already been taken or
     are in full force and effect) is required (A) for the pledge of the
     Security Collateral, for the assignment of the Assigned Agreements, for the
     grant of the security interest in the Collateral held by such Grantor
     hereby or for the execution, delivery or performance of this Agreement by
     such Grantor, or (B) for the exercise by the Agent of the voting rights in
     the Pledged Shares or of any other rights or remedies in respect of the
     Collateral hereunder except as may be required in connection with any
     disposition of Collateral consisting of securities by laws affecting the
     offering and sale of securities generally and except as may be required for
     the Agent to receive payments directly from the United States government
     under the Assignment of Claims Act, 31 U.S.C. (S) 3727 and 41 U.S.C. (S) 15
     (the "ASSIGNMENT OF CLAIMS ACT").
           ------------------------   

               (I) The Inventory has been produced by such Grantor in compliance
     with all requirements of the Fair Labor Standards Act.

               (J) To the best of such Grantor's knowledge, each trademark,
     copyright and patent material to the operations of the Company and its
     Subsidiaries taken as a whole is validly subsisting and is presently in
     good standing.

               (K) Except as has not had and would not reasonably be expected to
     have a Material Adverse Effect, no claim has been made by a third party
     that any Intellectual Property is invalid or unenforceable.

               (L) Except as has not had and would not reasonably be expected to
     have a Material Adverse Effect, no claim has been made that the use of any
     Intellectual Property does or may violate the rights of any third party.

               (M) In connection with the sale in May 1990 of the business of
     Whittaker Technical Products, Inc. and/or its predecessor entities located
     in Pawcatuck, Connecticut to Yardney Technical Products, Inc. (the
     "BUYER"), (i) a conveyance of all the rights in all of the contracts
      -----

     not entitled to receive benefit from such contracts.

          SECTION 8.  FURTHER ASSURANCES.
                      ------------------ 

               (A) Each Grantor agrees that from time to time, at the expense of
     such Grantor, such Grantor will promptly execute and deliver all further
     instruments and documents, and take all further action, that may be
     necessary or desirable, or that the Agent may reasonably request, in order
     to perfect, protect and maintain the priority of any pledge, assignment or
     security interest granted or purported to be granted hereby or to enable
     the Agent to exercise and enforce its rights and remedies hereunder with
     respect to any Collateral.  Without limiting the generality of the
     foregoing, each Grantor will: (i) at the request of the Agent made at any
     time after the occurrence and during the continuation of an Event of
     Default, mark conspicuously each document included in the Inventory, each
     chattel paper included in the Receivables, each Related Contract, each
     Assigned Agreement and each of its records pertaining to the Collateral
     with a legend, in form and substance satisfactory to the Agent, indicating
     that such document, chattel paper, Related Contract, Assigned Agreement or
     Collateral is subject to the security interest granted hereby; (ii) if any
     Collateral shall be evidenced by, or if such Grantor shall otherwise be the
     payee under, a promissory note or other instrument or chattel paper having
     a principal balance in excess of One Million Dollars ($1,000,000), deliver
     and pledge to the Agent hereunder such note or instrument or chattel paper
     duly indorsed and accompanied by duly executed instruments of transfer or
     assignment, all in form and substance satisfactory to the Agent; and (iii)
     execute and file such financing or continuation statements, or amendments
     thereto, and such other instruments or notices, as may be necessary or
     desirable, or as the Agent may reasonably request, in order to perfect and
     preserve, with the required priority, the pledge, assignment and security
     interest granted or purported to be granted hereby.

               (B) Each Grantor hereby authorizes the Agent to file one or more
     financing or continuation statements, and amendments thereto, relating to
     all or any part of the Collateral without the signature of such Grantor
     where permitted by law.  A photocopy or other reproduction of this
     Agreement or any financing statement covering the Collateral or any part
     thereof shall be sufficient as a financing statement where permitted by
     law.

               (C) Each Grantor will furnish to the Agent, from time to time,
     statements and schedules further identifying and describing the Collateral
     and such other reports in connection with the Collateral as the Agent may
     reasonably request, all in reasonable detail.

               (D) Each Grantor agrees that, at the request of the Agent,
     following the occurrence and during the continuance of an Event of Default,
     such Grantor will execute any and all documents, notices or instruments as
     may be necessary or desirable, or as the Agent may reasonably request, to
     direct the United States government to pay to the Agent, for the account of
     the Agent and the Lenders, all amounts otherwise payable to the Grantors
     under the Assignment of Claims Act.

               (E) Each Grantor shall (i) preserve and maintain all material
     rights in the Intellectual Property, and (ii) upon the occurrence and
     during the continuation of an Event of Default, use its best efforts to
     obtain any consents, waivers or agreements necessary to enable the Agent to
     exercise its remedies with respect to the Intellectual Property.  No
     Grantor shall abandon any material right to file a copyright, patent or
     trademark application nor shall any Grantor abandon any material pending
     copyright, patent or trademark application, or material Copyright, Patent
     or Trademark without the prior written consent of Agent.

          SECTION 9.  AS TO EQUIPMENT AND INVENTORY.
                      ----------------------------- 

               (A) Each Grantor shall keep the Equipment and Inventory of such
     Grantor (other than (i) Inventory sold in the ordinary course of business,
     and (ii) Equipment and Inventory with an aggregate value that does not
     exceed $500,000) at the places therefor specified on Schedule II or, upon
     prior written notice to the Agent, at such other places in a jurisdiction
     where all action required by Section 8 shall have been taken with respect
     to the Equipment and Inventory.

               (B) Each Grantor shall cause the Equipment material to its
     operations to be maintained and preserved in good repair and working order,
     ordinary wear and tear and damage due to casualty excepted, and make or
     cause to be made all appropriate repairs, renewals and replacements
     thereof, to the extent not obsolete, and consistent with past practice of
     such Grantor, as quickly as practicable after the occurrence of any loss or
     damage thereto, that are necessary or desirable to such end.  Each Grantor
     shall promptly furnish to the Agent a statement respecting any material
     loss or damages to any of the Equipment or Inventory.

          SECTION 10.  INSURANCE.
                       --------- 

               (A) Each Grantor (or the Company, on behalf of each Grantor)
     shall, at its own expense, maintain insurance with respect to the Equipment
     and Inventory of such Grantor with financially sound and reputable insurers
     in such amounts, against such risks and in such form as is consistent with
     past practice and as is usually carried by companies engaged in similar
     businesses and owning similar properties in the same general areas in which
     such Grantor operates.  Each policy for property damage insurance shall
     provide for all losses (except for losses of less than $5,000,000 per
     occurrence) to be paid directly to the Agent.  Each such policy shall in
     addition (i) name such Grantor (or the Company) and the Agent as insured
     parties thereunder (without any representation or warranty by or obligation
     upon the Agent) as their interests may appear, (ii) in the case of property
     damage insurance, contain the agreement by the insurer that any loss
     thereunder shall be payable to the Agent notwithstanding any action,
     inaction or breach of representation or warranty by such Grantor, (iii) not
     contain any provision providing for recourse against the Agent for payment
     of premiums or other amounts with respect thereto and (iv) provide that at
     least 10 days' prior written notice of cancellation or of lapse shall be
     given to the Agent by the insurer.  Each Grantor (or the Company) shall, if
     so requested by the Agent, deliver to the Agent original or duplicate
     policies of such insurance and, as often as the Agent may reasonably
     request, a report of a reputable insurance broker with respect to such
     insurance.  Further, each Grantor (or the Company) shall, at the request of
     the Agent, duly exercise and deliver instruments of assignment of such
     insurance policies to comply with the requirements of this Section 10 and
     cause the insurers to acknowledge notice of such assignment.

               (B) Reimbursement under any liability insurance maintained by
     such Grantor pursuant to this Section 10 may be paid directly to the Person
     who shall have incurred liability covered by such insurance.  In case of
     any loss involving damage to Equipment or Inventory when subsection (c) of
     this Section 10 is not applicable, such Grantor shall make or cause to be
     made the necessary repairs to or replacements of such Equipment or
     Inventory, and any proceeds of insurance maintained by such Grantor
     pursuant to this Section 10 and received by the Agent shall be released to
     such Grantor as reimbursement for the costs of such repairs or
     replacements.

               (C) At the request of the Agent, upon the occurrence and during
     the continuance of any Event of Default, all insurance payments in respect
     of such Equipment or Inventory shall be paid to and applied by the Agent as
     specified in Section 19(b) hereof.

                       --------------------------------------------------------
INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY.
- - --------------------- 

               (A) Each Grantor shall keep its  chief place of business and
     chief executive office and the office where it keeps its records concerning
     the Collateral and all originals of all chattel paper that evidence
     Receivables, at the location therefor specified on Schedule II or, upon
     prior written notice to the Agent, at such other locations in a
     jurisdiction where all actions required by Section 8 shall have been taken
     with respect to the Collateral.  Each Grantor will hold and preserve such
     records, Assigned Agreements and chattel paper and will permit
     representatives of the Agent at any time during normal business hours to
     inspect and make abstracts from such records and chattel paper.

               (B) Except as otherwise provided in this subsection (b), each
     Grantor shall continue to collect in accordance with its customary
     practice, at its own expense, all amounts due or to become due such Grantor
     under the Receivables and, prior to the occurrence of an Event of Default,
     such Grantor shall have the right to adjust, settle or compromise the
     amount or payment of any Account, or release wholly or partly any account
     debtor or obligor thereof, or allow any credit or discount thereon, all in
     accordance with its customary practices.  In connection with such
     collections, each Grantor may take (and, upon the occurrence and during the
     continuation of an Event of Default, at the Agent's direction, shall take)
     such action as such Grantor or the Agent may deem necessary or advisable to
     enforce collection of the Receivables; provided, however, that the Agent
                                            --------  -------                
     shall have the right, upon the occurrence and during the continuance of an
     Event of Default, and upon written notice to such Grantor of its intention
     to do so, to notify the obligors under any Receivables of the assignment of
     such Receivables to the Agent and to direct such obligors to make payment
     of all amounts due or to become due to such Grantor thereunder directly to
     the Agent and, upon such notification and at the expense of such Grantor,
     to enforce collection of any such Receivables, and to adjust, settle or
     compromise the amount or payment thereof, in the same manner and to the
     same extent as such Grantor might have done.  After receipt by such Grantor
     or Grantors of the notice from the Agent referred to in the proviso to the
                                                                 -------       
     preceding sentence, (i) all amounts and proceeds (including instruments)
     received by such Grantor in respect of the Receivables shall be received in
     trust for the benefit of the Agent hereunder, shall be segregated from
     other funds of such Grantor and shall be forthwith paid over to the Agent
     in the same form as so received (with any necessary indorsement) to be
     applied as provided by Section 19(b) and (ii) such Grantor shall not
     adjust, settle or compromise the amount or payment of any Receivable,
     release wholly or partly any obligor thereof, or allow any credit or
     discount thereon.

                    (ii)  Each Grantor shall be entitled to receive and retain
          any and all dividends and interest paid in respect of the Security
          Collateral; provided, however, that any and all dividends and interest
                      --------  -------

          instruments and other property (other than cash) received, receivable
          or otherwise distributed in respect of or in exchange for, any
          Security Collateral shall be forthwith delivered to the Agent to hold
          as, Security Collateral and shall, if received by such Grantor, be
          received in trust for the benefit of the Agent, be segregated from the
          other property or funds of such Grantor and be forthwith delivered to
          the Agent as Security Collateral in the same form as so received (with
          any necessary indorsement).

                    (iii) The Agent shall execute and deliver (or cause to be
          executed and delivered) to any Grantor all such proxies and other
          instruments as such Grantor may reasonably request for the purpose of
          enabling such Grantor to exercise the voting and other rights that it
          is entitled to exercise pursuant to clause (i) above and to receive
          the dividends or interest payments that it is authorized to receive
          and retain pursuant to clause (ii) above.

               (B) Upon the occurrence and during the continuance of an Event of
     Default and after notice to the Company from the Agent or the Required
     Lenders:

                    (i) All rights of each Grantor (x) to exercise or refrain
          from exercising the voting and other consensual rights that it would
          otherwise be entitled to exercise pursuant to Section 12(a)(i) and (y)
          to receive the dividends and interest payments that it would otherwise
          be authorized to receive and retain pursuant to Section 12(a)(ii)
          shall cease, and all such rights shall thereupon become vested in the
          Agent, so long as an Event of Default shall continue, which shall
          thereupon have the sole right to exercise or refrain from exercising
          such voting and other consensual rights and to receive and hold as
          Security Collateral such dividends and interest payments.  Each
          Grantor shall execute and deliver such instruments evidencing such
          Grantor's right to exercise such voting rights as the Agent may
          request.

               (ii) All dividends and interest payments that are received by any
          Grantor contrary to the provisions of paragraph (i) of this Section
          12(b) shall be received in trust for the benefit of the Agent, shall
          be segregated from other funds of such Grantor and shall be forthwith
          paid over to the Agent as Security Collateral in the same form as so
          received (with any necessary indorsement).

                       --------------------------------------                   
request of the Agent at any time when an Event of Default has occurred and is
continuing, each Grantor agrees to instruct each other party to each Assigned
Agreement of such Grantor, that so long as any Event of Default shall have

     pledge hereunder, immediately upon its acquisition (directly or indirectly)
     thereof, any and all such additional shares of stock or other securities
     issued to such Grantor.  Each Grantor hereby authorizes the Agent to modify
     this Agreement by amending Schedule I to include such additional shares or

          SECTION 16.  AGENT APPOINTED ATTORNEY-IN-FACT.  Each Grantor hereby
                       --------------------------------

     discharge for the same,

agreement contained herein, the Agent, upon written notice, if practicable, to
such Grantor or the Company, may itself perform, or cause performance of, such
agreement, and the reasonable expenses of the Agent incurred in connection
therewith shall be payable by such Grantor and the Company under Section 21(b).

          SECTION 18.  THE AGENT'S DUTIES.  The powers conferred on the Agent
                       ------------------                                    
hereunder are solely to protect its interest in the Collateral and shall not
impose any duty upon it to exercise any such powers.  Except for the safe
custody of any Collateral in its possession and the accounting for moneys
actually received by it hereunder, the Agent shall have no duty as to any
Collateral, as to ascertaining or taking action with respect to calls,
conversions, exchanges, maturities, tenders or other matters relative to any
Security Collateral, whether or not the Agent or any Lender has or is deemed to
have knowledge of such matters, or as to the taking of any necessary steps to
preserve rights against any parties or any other rights pertaining to any
Collateral.  The Agent shall be deemed to have exercised reasonable care in the
custody and preservation of any Collateral in its possession if such Collateral
is accorded treatment substantially equal to that which NationsBank accords its
own property.

          SECTION 19.  REMEDIES.  If any Event of Default shall have occurred
                       --------                                              
and be continuing:

               (A) The Agent may exercise in respect of the Collateral, in
     addition to all other rights and remedies provided for herein or otherwise
     available to it, all the rights and remedies of a secured party upon
     default under the Uniform Commercial Code in effect in the State of New
     York at such time (the "N.Y. UNIFORM COMMERCIAL CODE") (whether or not the
                             ----------------------------                      
     N.Y. Uniform Commercial Code applies to the affected Collateral) and also
     may (i) require each Grantor to, and each Grantor hereby agrees that it
     will at its expense and upon request of the Agent forthwith, assemble all
     or part of the Collateral as directed by the Agent and make it available to
     the Agent at a place to be designated by the Agent that is reasonably
     convenient to both parties and (ii) without notice except as specified
     below, sell the Collateral or any part thereof in one or more parcels at
     public or private sale, at any of the Agent's offices or elsewhere, for
     cash, on credit or for future delivery, and upon such other terms as the
     Agent may deem commercially reasonable.  Each Grantor agrees that, to the
     extent notice of sale shall be required by law, at least 10 days' notice to
     such Grantor of the time and place of any public sale or the time after
     which any private sale is to be made shall constitute reasonable
     notification.  The Agent shall not be obligated to make any sale of
     Collateral regardless of notice of sale having been given.  The Agent may
     adjourn any public or private sale from time to time by announcement at the
     time and place fixed therefor, and such sale may, without further notice,
     be made at the time and place to which it was so adjourned.

               (B) All cash proceeds received by the Agent in respect of any
     sale of, collection from, or other realization upon all or any part of the
     Collateral may, in the discretion of the Agent, be held by the Agent as
     collateral for, and/or then or at any time thereafter applied (after
     payment of any amounts payable to the Agent pursuant to Section 21) in
     whole or in part by the Agent for the ratable benefit of the Lenders
     against, all or any part of the Secured Obligations in such order as the
     Agent shall elect.  Any surplus of such cash or cash proceeds held by the
     Agent and remaining after payment in full of all the Secured Obligations
     shall be promptly paid over to the Company or to whomsoever may be lawfully
     entitled to receive such surplus.

               (C) The Agent may exercise any and all rights and remedies of any
     Grantor under or in connection with the Assigned Agreements or otherwise in
     respect of the Collateral, including, without limitation, any and all
     rights of any Grantor to demand or otherwise require payment of any amount
     under, or performance of any provision of, any Assigned Agreement.

               (D) All payments received by any of the Grantors under or in
     connection with any Assigned Agreement or otherwise in respect of the
     Collateral shall be received in trust for the benefit of the Agent, shall
     be segregated from other funds of such Grantor and shall be

                                      14
<PAGE>
 
     forthwith paid over to the Agent in the same form as so received (with any
     necessary indorsement).

               (E) The Agent may, without notice to any Grantor except as
     required by law and at any time or from time to time, charge, set-off and
     otherwise apply all or any part of the Secured Obligations against the L/C
     Cash Collateral Account or any part thereof.

          SECTION 20.  REGISTRATION RIGHTS.  If the Agent shall determine to
                       -------------------                                  
exercise its right to sell all or any of the Pledged Shares pursuant to Section
19, each Grantor agrees that, upon request of the Agent, such Grantor will, at
its own expense:

               (A) execute and deliver, and cause each issuer of the Pledged
     Shares contemplated to be sold and the directors and officers thereof to
     execute and deliver, all such instruments and documents, and do or cause to
     be done all such other acts and things, as may be necessary or, in the
     opinion of the Agent, advisable to register such Pledged Shares under the
     provisions of the Securities Act of 1933, as from time to time amended (the
     "SECURITIES ACT"), to cause the registration statement relating thereto to
      --------------                                                           
     become effective and to remain effective for such period as prospectuses
     are required by law to be furnished and to make all amendments and
     supplements thereto and to the related prospectus that, in the opinion of
     the Agent, are necessary or advisable, all in conformity with the
     requirements of the Securities Act and the rules and regulations of the
     Securities and Exchange Commission applicable thereto;

               (B) use its best efforts to qualify the Pledged Shares under the
     state securities or "Blue Sky" laws and to obtain all necessary
     governmental approvals for the sale of the Pledged Shares, as requested by
     the Agent;

               (C) provide the Agent with such other information and projections
     as may be necessary or, in the opinion of the Agent, advisable to enable
     the Agent to effect the sale of such Pledged Shares; and

               (D) do or cause to be done all such other acts and things as may
     be necessary to make such sale of the Pledged Shares or any part thereof
     valid and binding and in compliance with applicable law.

The Agent is authorized, in connection with any sale of the Pledged Shares
pursuant to Section 19, to deliver or otherwise disclose to any prospective
purchaser of the Pledged Shares (i) any registration statement or prospectus,
and all supplements and amendments thereto, prepared pursuant to clause (a)
above, (ii) subject to the requirements imposed by the securities laws, any
information and projections provided to it pursuant to clause (d) above and
(iii) subject to the requirements imposed by the securities laws, any other
information in its possession relating to the Pledged Shares.

          Each Grantor acknowledges the impossibility of ascertaining the amount
of damages that would be suffered by the Agent or the Lenders by reason of the
failure by any Grantor to perform any of the covenants contained in this Section
and, consequently, agrees that, if any Grantor shall fail to perform any of such
covenants, such Grantor or the Company shall pay, as liquidated damages and not
as a penalty, an amount equal to the value of the Pledged Shares on the date the
Agent shall demand compliance with this Section.

          SECTION 21.  INDEMNITY AND EXPENSES; TAXES.  (A)  Each Grantor agrees,
                       -----------------------------                            
jointly and severally, to indemnify each Indemnified Party from and against any
and all claims, losses and liabilities growing out of or resulting from this
Agreement (including, without limitation, enforcement of this

                                      15
<PAGE>
 
Agreement), except claims, losses or liabilities resulting from such Indemnified
Party's gross negligence or willful misconduct as determined by a final judgment
of a court of competent jurisdiction.

          (B) Each Grantor agrees, jointly and severally, to pay to the Agent,
upon written demand, the amount of any and all reasonable expenses, including
the reasonable fees and expenses of its counsel and of any experts and agents,
that the Agent may incur in connection with (i) the administration of this
Agreement, (ii) the custody, preservation, use or operation of, or the sale of,
collection from or other realization upon, any of the Collateral, (iii) the
exercise or enforcement of any of the rights of the Agent or the Lenders
hereunder or (iv) the failure by such Grantor to perform or observe any of the
provisions hereof.

          (C) Each Grantor shall pay (i) all taxes, assessments and other
charges of Governmental Authorities imposed upon any of the Collateral before
any material penalty or interest accrues thereon, and (ii) all claims
(including, without limitation, claims for labor, services, materials and
supplies) for sums materially adversely affecting the Collateral, which have
become due and payable and which by law have or may become a Lien (other than a
Permitted Lien) upon any of the Collateral prior to the time when any material
penalty or fine shall be incurred with respect thereto; provided, that no such
                                                        --------              
taxes, assessments and charges of Governmental Authorities referred to in clause
(i) above or claims referred to in clause (ii) above need to be paid if being
contested in good faith by appropriate proceedings promptly instituted and
diligently conducted and enforcement thereof is stayed and if a reserve or other
appropriate provision required in conformity with GAAP shall have been made
therefor and if, at the request of the Agent, it posts a bond or other form of
indemnity satisfactory to the Agent in the amount of such contested taxes,
assessments and charges plus any applicable interest and penalties.

      SECTION 22.  SECURITY INTEREST ABSOLUTE.  The obligations of each Grantor
                   --------------------------                                  
under this Agreement are independent of the Secured Obligations, and a separate
action or actions may be brought and prosecuted against each Grantor to enforce
this Agreement, irrespective of whether any action is brought against the
Company or whether the Company is joined in any such action or actions.  All
rights of the Agent and the pledge, assignment and security interest hereunder,
and all obligations of each Grantor hereunder, shall be absolute and
unconditional, irrespective of:

               (A) any lack of validity or enforceability of any Loan Document
     or any other agreement or instrument relating thereto;

               (B) any change in the time, manner or place of payment of, or in
     any other term of, all or any of the Secured Obligations or any other
     amendment or waiver of or any consent to any departure from any Loan
     Document, including, without limitation, any increase in the Secured
     Obligations resulting from the extension of additional credit to the
     Company or any of its Subsidiaries or otherwise;

               (C) any taking, exchange, release or non-perfection of any other
     collateral, or any taking, release or amendment or waiver of or consent to
     departure from any guaranty, for all or any of the Secured Obligations;

               (D) any manner of application of collateral, or proceeds thereof,
     to all or any of the Secured Obligations, or any manner of sale or other
     disposition of any collateral for all or any of the Secured Obligations or
     any other assets of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries;

               (E) any change, restructuring or termination of the corporate
     structure or existence of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries; or

                                     16                              
<PAGE>
 
               (F) any other circumstance that might otherwise constitute a
     defense available to, or a discharge of, such Grantor or a third party
     grantor of a security interest.

          SECTION 23.  AMENDMENTS; WAIVERS; ETC.  No amendment or waiver of any
                       ------------------------                                
provision of this Agreement, and no consent to any departure by any Grantor
herefrom, shall in any event be effective unless the same shall be in writing
and signed by the Agent and each Grantor, and then such waiver or consent shall
be effective only in the specific instance and for the specific purpose for
which given; provided, however, that any amendment to this Agreement that is in
             --------  -------                                                 
substantially the same form as Exhibit K to the Credit Agreement shall be
effective when signed by only the Agent and the Additional Grantor (as defined
therein).  No failure on the part of the Agent to exercise, and no delay in
exercising any right hereunder, shall operate as a waiver thereof; nor shall any
single or partial exercise of any such right preclude any other or further
exercise thereof or the exercise of any other right.

          SECTION 24.  ADDRESSES FOR NOTICES.  All notices and other
                       ---------------------                        
communications provided for hereunder shall be in writing (including telecopier,
telegraphic, telex or cable communication) and, mailed, telegraphed, telecopied,
telexed, cabled or delivered to each Grantor or to the Agent, as the case may
be, in each case addressed to it at its address specified in the Credit
Agreement or on the signature pages hereof, or, as to any party, at such other
address as shall be designated by such party in a written notice to each other
party complying as to delivery with the terms of this Section.  All such notices
and other communications shall, when mailed, telecopied, telegraphed, telexed or
cabled, respectively, be effective when deposited in the mails, telecopied,
delivered to the telegraph company, confirmed by telex answerback or delivered
to the cable company, respectively, addressed as aforesaid.

          SECTION 25.  CONTINUING SECURITY INTEREST; ASSIGNMENTS UNDER THE
                       ---------------------------------------------------
CREDIT AGREEMENT.  This Agreement shall create a continuing security interest in
- - ----------------

the payment in full in cash of the Secured Obligations or the termination of the
Commitments of the Lenders, (b) be binding upon each Grantor, its successors and
assigns and (c) inure, together with the rights and remedies of the Agent
hereunder, to the benefit of the Agent, the Lenders and their respective
successors, transferees and assigns.  Without limiting the generality of the
foregoing clause (c), any Lender may assign or otherwise transfer all or any
portion of its rights and obligations under the Credit Agreement (including,
without limitation, all or any portion of its Commitment, the Advances owing to
it and the Notes, if any, held by it) to any other Person, and such other Person
shall thereupon become vested with all the benefits in respect thereof granted
to such Lender herein or otherwise, in each case as provided in Section 9.07 of

Credit Agreement, the "AGENT") for the Lenders.
                       -----                   

          PRELIMINARY STATEMENT.  The Lenders and the Agent are parties to a
Credit Agreement dated as of January 23, 1995 (said Agreement, as it may
hereafter be amended, supplemented or otherwise modified from time to time,
being the "CREDIT AGREEMENT"; the terms defined therein and not otherwise
           ----------------                                              
defined herein being used herein as therein defined) with Whittaker Corporation,
a Delaware corporation (the "BORROWER").  The Guarantors will derive substantial
                             --------                                           
direct and indirect benefit from the transactions contemplated by the Credit
Agreement.  It is a condition precedent to the making of Advances and the
issuance of Letters of Credit by the Lenders under the Credit Agreement that the
Guarantors shall have executed and delivered this Guaranty.

          NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the premises and in order to
induce the Lenders to make Advances and issue Letters of Credit under the Credit
Agreement, the Guarantors hereby agree, jointly and severally, as follows:

          SECTION 1. GUARANTY.  Each Guarantor, jointly and severally, hereby
                     --------                                                
unconditionally guarantees the punctual payment when due, whether at stated
maturity, by acceleration or otherwise, of all Obligations of the Borrower now
or hereafter existing under the Credit Agreement, the Notes, if any, and each
other Loan Document and under each Hedge Agreement to which any Lender is a
party, including in each case any extensions, modifications, substitutions,
amendments and renewals thereof, including in each case whether for principal
(including reimbursement for amounts drawn under Letters of Credit), interest,
fees, expenses, indemnification or otherwise (such Obligations being the
                                                                        
"GUARANTEED OBLIGATIONS"), and agrees to pay any and all expenses (including
- - -----------------------                                                     
reasonable counsel fees and expenses) incurred by the Agent or the Lenders in
enforcing any rights under this Guaranty; provided that any Hedge Agreement to
                                          --------                            
which a Lender is a party shall be a Guaranteed Obligation only so long as there
are any Borrowings or Commitments outstanding under the Credit Agreement; and
provided further, that each Guarantor and, by acceptance hereof, the Agent and
- - -------- -------                                                              
each Lender hereby confirms that it is the intention of all such parties that
the guarantee by such Guarantor pursuant to this Guaranty not constitute a
fraudulent transfer or conveyance for purposes of Title 11 of the U.S. Code, the
Uniform Fraudulent Conveyance Act, the Uniform Fraudulent Transfer Act or any
similar federal or state law.  To effectuate the foregoing intention, the
obligations of each Guarantor under this guaranty shall be limited to the
maximum amount as will, after giving effect to all other liabilities of such
Guarantor (including, but not limited to, contingent liabilities, but excluding
the liabilities of such Guarantor hereunder) and after giving effect to any
collections from or payments made by or on behalf of any other guarantor in
respect of the obligations of such other Guarantor under this Guaranty or
pursuant to Section
<PAGE>
 
8 hereof, result in the obligations of such Guarantor under this guaranty not
constituting such fraudulent transfer or conveyance.  Without limiting the
generality of the foregoing (but subject to the preceding sentence), each
Guarantor's liability shall extend to all amounts that constitute part of the
Guaranteed Obligations and would be owed by the Borrower to the Agent and the
Lenders under the Loan Documents but for the fact that they are unenforceable or
not allowable due to the existence of a bankruptcy, reorganization or similar
proceeding involving any Loan Party.

          SECTION 2. GUARANTY ABSOLUTE. Each Guarantor guarantees that the
                     -----------------                                     
Guaranteed Obligations will be paid strictly in accordance with the terms of the
Loan Documents, regardless of any law, regulation or order now or hereafter in
effect in any jurisdiction affecting any of such terms or the rights of the
Agent or the Lenders with respect thereto.  The Obligations of the Guarantors
under this Guaranty are independent of the Guaranteed Obligations, and a
separate action or actions may be brought and prosecuted against the Guarantors
to enforce this Guaranty, irrespective of whether any action is brought against
the Borrower or whether the Borrower is joined in any such action or actions.
The liability of each Guarantor under this Guaranty shall be absolute and
unconditional, and shall not be affected or released in any way, irrespective
of:

               (A)   any lack of validity or enforceability of the Credit
     Agreement, any other Loan Document or any other agreement or instrument
     relating thereto for any reason, including, without limitation, the
     existence of a bankruptcy, reorganization or similar proceeding involving
     any Loan Party;

               (B)   any change in the time, manner or place of payment of, or
     in any other term of, all or any of the Guaranteed Obligations or any of
     the Loan Documents, or any other taking, release, amendment or waiver of or
     any consent to any departure from the Credit Agreement, any other Loan
     Document or any other guaranty of any or all of the Guaranteed Obligations,
     including, without limitation, any increase in the Guaranteed Obligations
     resulting from the extension of additional credit to any Loan Party or
     otherwise;

               (C)   any enforcement of any Loan Document, including the taking,
     exchange, holding, sale, additional guarantee or other disposition of any
     Collateral, or any amendment, alteration, exchange, substitution, transfer,
     enforcement, waiver, subordination, termination or release of any
     Collateral or such guaranties, or non-perfection of any Liens created by
     any Collateral Document, or any consent to departure from any such guaranty
     for all or any of the Guaranteed Obligations;

               (D)   any refusal of payment by the Agent or any Lender, in whole
     or in part, from any obligor or guarantor in connection with any of the
     Guaranteed Obligations, whether or not with notice to, or further assent
     by, or any reservation of rights against, any Guarantor;

               (E)   any change, restructuring or termination of the corporate
     structure or existence of any Loan Party;

               (F)   any other circumstance which might otherwise constitute a
     defense available to, or a discharge of, any Loan Party or any other
     guarantor of the Guaranteed Obligations;

               (G)   any manner of application of any Collateral, or proceeds
     thereof, to all or any of the Guaranteed Obligations, or any manner of sale
     or other disposition of any Collateral for all or any of the Guaranteed
     Obligations or any other assets of any Loan Party; or


                                       2
<PAGE>
 
               (H)   any modification, compounding, compromise, settlement,
     release by any lender or any other Person (or by operation of the law or
     otherwise), collection or other liquidation of the Obligations or the
     liability of any Loan Party, or of the Collateral, in whole or in part.

          This Guaranty shall continue to be effective or be reinstated, as the
case may be, if at any time any payment of any of the Guaranteed Obligations is
rescinded or must otherwise be returned by any Lender or any other Person upon
the insolvency, bankruptcy or reorganization of any Loan Party or otherwise, all
as though such payment had not been made.

          SECTION 3. WAIVERS. Each Guarantor hereby waives, to the extent
                     -------                                              
permitted by applicable law:

               (A)   promptness, diligence, notice of acceptance and any other
     notice with respect to any of the Guaranteed Obligations or any other
     obligations under the Loan Documents or this Guaranty;

               (B)   any requirement that the Agent or any Lender or any other
     Person protect, secure or insure any Lien or any property subject thereto
     or exhaust any right or take any action against any Loan Party or any other
     Person or any Collateral;

               (C)   any defense arising by reason of any claim or defense based
     upon an election of remedies by any Lender which in any manner impairs,
     reduces, releases or otherwise adversely affects its subrogation,
     contribution or reimbursement rights (if any) or other rights (if any) to
     proceed against any Loan Party or any other Person or any Collateral; and

               (D)   any duty on the part of the Agent or any Lender to disclose
     to such Guarantor any matter, fact or thing relating to the business,
     operation or condition of any Loan Party and its assets now know or
     hereafter known by the Agent or such Lender.

          SECTION 4. WAIVER OF SUBROGATION; SUBORDINATION.
                     ------------------------------------ 

               (A)   Until all the Guaranteed Obligations and all other amounts
     payable under this Guaranty shall have been paid in full and the obligation
     of the Lenders to make Advances and issue Letters of Credit shall have
     expired or terminated (and except as otherwise provided in Section 8), each
     Guarantor (i) agrees that it shall not enforce or otherwise exercise any
     right of subrogation to any of the rights of the Agent or any Lender
     against the Borrower or any right of reimbursement or contribution or
     similar right against the Borrower, any endorser or any other guarantor of
     all or any part of the Guaranteed Obligations or any guarantor thereof and
     (ii) waives the benefit of, and any right to participate in, any security
     or collateral given to the Agent or any Lender to secure payment of the
     Guaranteed Obligations.  If any amount shall be paid to any Guarantor on
     account of such subrogation, reimbursement or contribution rights at any
     time prior to the later of (x) the payment in full of the Guaranteed
     Obligations and all other amounts payable under this Guaranty and (y) the
     expiration or termination of the obligation of the Lenders to make Advances
     and issue Letters of Credit, such amount shall be held in trust for the
     benefit of the Lenders and shall forthwith be paid to the Agent to be
     credited and applied against the Guaranteed Obligations, whether matured or
     unmatured, in accordance with the terms of the Credit Agreement or to be
     held by the Agent as collateral security for any Guaranteed Obligations
     thereafter existing.  Each Guarantor hereby agrees that it shall not, so
     long as an Event of Default has occurred and is continuing and until all
     the Guaranteed Obligations and all other amounts payable under this
     Guaranty shall have been paid in full and the obligation of the Lenders to


                                       3
<PAGE>
 
     make Advances and issue Letters of Credit shall have expired or terminated,
     assert any claim or counterclaim it may have against the Borrower or setoff
     any of its obligations to the Borrower against any obligations of the
     Borrower to it.

               (B)   Each Guarantor hereby agrees that any indebtedness of the
     Borrower now or hereafter owing to such Guarantor (the "SUBORDINATED DEBT")
                                                             -----------------  
     is hereby subordinated to all of the Guaranteed Obligations and all other
     amounts payable under this Guaranty, whether heretofore, now or hereafter
     created, and that without the prior consent of the Agent, the Subordinated
     Debt shall not be paid in whole or in part until the Guaranteed Obligations
     and all other amounts payable under this Guaranty have been paid in full
     and the Credit Agreement has been terminated and is of no further force or
     effect, except that payments of principal and interest on the Subordinated
     Debt shall be permitted (i) so long as no Event of Default shall have
     occurred and be continuing and (ii) during the continuance of any Event of
     Default so long as the Agent has not provided the Company and each
     Guarantor with written notice of default stating that such payment shall no
     longer be permitted, but in either of the foregoing events only to the
     extent such payments would not render the Borrower incapable of performing
     the Guaranteed Obligations.  Each Guarantor agrees that it will not accept
     any payment of or on account of any Subordinated Debt at any time in
     contravention of the foregoing.  At the request of the Agent, following the
     occurrence and during the continuance of an Event of Default, each
     Guarantor hereby agrees to direct the Borrower to pay to the Agent, for the
     account of the Agent and the Lenders, all or any part of the Subordinated
     Debt and any amount so paid to the Agent shall be applied to payment of the
     Guaranteed Obligations and all other amounts payable under this Guaranty.
     Each payment on the Subordinated Debt received in violation of any of the
     provisions hereof shall be deemed to have been received as trustee for the
     Agent and shall be paid over to the Agent immediately on account of the
     Guaranteed Obligations, but without otherwise affecting in any manner any
     Guarantor's liability under any of the provisions of this Guaranty.  Each
     Guarantor agrees to file all claims against the Borrower in any bankruptcy
     or other proceeding in which the filing of claims is required by law in
     respect of any Subordinated Debt, and the Agent shall be entitled to all of
     such Guarantor's rights thereunder.  If for any reason any Guarantor fails
     to file such claim at least 30 days prior to the last date on which such
     claim should be filed, the Agent, as such Guarantor's attorney-in-fact, is
     hereby authorized to do so in such Guarantor's name or, in the Agent's
     discretion, to assign such claim to and cause proof of claim to be filed in
     the name of the Agent or its nominee.  In all such cases, whether in
     reorganization, bankruptcy or otherwise, the Person or Persons authorized
     to pay such claim shall pay to the Agent, for the account of the Agent and
     the Lenders, the full amount payable on the claim in the proceeding, and,
     to the full extent necessary for that purpose, each Guarantor hereby
     assigns to the Agent, for the account of the Agent and the Lenders, all of
     such Guarantor's rights to any payments or distributions to which such
     Guarantor otherwise would be entitled.  If the amount so paid is greater
     than such Guarantor's liability hereunder, the Agent will pay the excess
     amount to the party entitled thereto.  In addition, each Guarantor hereby
     appoints the Agent as its attorney-in-fact to exercise all of such
     Guarantor's voting rights in connection with any bankruptcy proceeding or
     any plan for the reorganization of the Borrower.

          SECTION 5. PAYMENTS FREE AND CLEAR OF TAXES, ETC.

     be made, in accordance with Section 2.09 of the Credit Agreement, free and
     clear of, and without deduction for, any and all present or future Taxes.
     If any Guarantor shall be required by law to deduct any Taxes from or in
     respect of any sum payable hereunder to any Lender or the Agent, (i) the
     sum payable shall be increased as may be necessary so that after making all
     required deductions (including deductions applicable to additional sums
     payable under this Section 5) such


                                       4
<PAGE>
 
     Lender or the Agent (as the case may be) receives an  amount equal to the
     sum it would have received had no such deductions been made, (ii) such
     Guarantor shall make such deductions and (iii) such Guarantor shall pay the
     full amount deducted to the relevant taxation authority or other authority
     in accordance with applicable law.

               (B)   In addition, each Guarantor agrees to pay any present or
     future Other Taxes.

               (C)   Each Guarantor will indemnify each Lender and the Agent for
     the full amount of Taxes or Other Taxes (including, without limitation, any
     Taxes or Other Taxes imposed by any jurisdiction on amounts payable under
     this Section 5) paid by such Lender or the Agent (as the case may be) and
     any liability (including penalties, interest and expenses) arising
     therefrom or with respect thereto.

               (D)   Each Guarantor shall indemnify the Agent and each Lender
     for the full amount of Taxes and Other Taxes, and for the full amount of
     taxes imposed by any jurisdiction on amounts payable under this Section,
     paid by the Agent or such Lender and any liability (including penalties,
     additions to tax, interest and expenses) arising therefrom or with respect
     thereto. Payments pursuant to this indemnification shall be made within 30
     days from the date such Lender makes written demand therefor setting forth
     in reasonable detail the basis of the Guarantor's obligation to indemnify
     such Lender pursuant to this Section; provided, however, that (i) in the
                                           --------  -------
     case of any Taxes or Other Taxes not required by law to be deducted by the
     applicable Guarantor from or in respect of any sum payable hereunder to the
     Agent or any Lender, such Guarantor shall be obligated to make payment to
     the Agent or such Lender pursuant to this Section (A) in respect of such
     Taxes or Other Taxes only if written demand therefor has been made by the
     Lender within 180 days from the date on which the Lender or the Agent, as
     the case may be, actually makes payment of the Taxes or Other Taxes to the
     relevant taxing authority, and (B) in respect of penalties and additions to
     tax attributable to late payment only to the extent that such penalties or
     additions to tax are accrued after the written demand therefore has been
     made by the Lender and (ii) no Guarantor shall be obligated to pay any
     Taxes or Other Taxes to the extent the Taxes or Other Taxes result from a
     change in the Lender's Applicable Lending Office.

               (E)   Within 30 days after the date of any payment of Taxes
     pursuant to this Section, the applicable Guarantor shall furnish to the
     Agent, at its address referred to in the Credit Agreement, evidence
     reasonably satisfactory to the Agent of payment thereof.  In the case of
     any payment hereunder for the account of the Agent or any Lender which is
     made by any Guarantor through an account or branch outside the United
     States or on behalf of any Guarantor by a payor that is not a United States
     person, if the applicable Guarantor determines that no Taxes are payable in
     respect thereof, such Guarantor shall, except where such mode of payment is
     at the request of the Agent or such Lender, furnish, or cause such payor to
     furnish, to the Agent, at such address, a certificate from the appropriate
     taxing authority or authorities or an opinion of counsel acceptable to the
     Agent, in either case stating that such payment is exempt from Taxes.  For
     purposes of this subsection (d), the terms "UNITED STATES" and "UNITED
                                                 -------------       ------
     STATES PERSON" shall have the meanings specified in Section 7701 of the
     -------------                                                          
     Internal Revenue Code.

               (F)   Without prejudice to the survival of any other agreement of
     any Guarantor hereunder, the agreements and obligations of each Guarantor
     contained in this Section 5 shall survive the payment in full of the
     Guaranteed Obligations and all other amounts payable under this Guaranty.

               only to the extent that, under applicable law, the applicable
               Grantor is expressly prohibited from granting a security interest
               therein or applicable law provides for the involuntary forfeiture
               of the property in the event a security interest is granted
               therein without the consent of the appropriate Governmental
               Authority, or at all; provided, however, that if such prohibition
                                     --------  -------
               or the condition requiring such consent relates only to the
               foreclosure of a security interest or the exercise of other
               rights and remedies upon a default but not to the granting of a
               security interest therein, then a security interest in such

               to the condition that the consent of such Governmental Authority
               is obtained by the Agent prior to foreclosure or exercising its
               other rights or remedies hereunder as to which such consent is
               required; and

               such property or any rights relating thereto expressly prohibit
               the granting of a security interest therein or condition the
               granting of a security interest therein on the consent of a third
               party whose consent has not been obtained or would cause, or
               allow a third party to cause, the forfeiture of such property
               upon the granting of a security interest therein; provided,
                                                                 --------

               consent relates only to the foreclosure of a security interest or
               the exercise of other rights or remedies upon a default, then a
               security interest in such property shall be deemed to be granted
               by this Agreement subject to the condition that the consent of
               such third party is obtained by the Agent prior to foreclosure or
               exercising of its other rights or remedies hereunder as to which
               such consent is required.

          In the event of the termination or elimination of any prohibition or
the requirement for any consent contained in any law, rule, regulation,
agreement, document or instrument to the extent sufficient to permit any
Excluded Property to become Collateral hereunder, or upon the granting of any
such consent, or waiving or terminating any requirement for such consent, a
security interest in such Excluded Property shall be automatically and
simultaneously granted hereunder in such Excluded Property, and the Excluded
Property automatically and simultaneously shall be deemed to be assigned and
pledged to the Agent and shall be included as Collateral hereunder.

          SECTION 2.  SECURITY FOR OBLIGATIONS.  This Agreement secures with
                      ------------------------                              
respect to each Grantor, and the Collateral of such Grantor is collateral
security for, the prompt payment and performance in full when due, whether on a
specified payment date, at stated maturity, by acceleration or otherwise
(including, without limitation, the payment of amounts that would become due but
for the operation of the automatic stay under Section 362(a) of the Bankruptcy
Code or any similar law) of all Obligations of such Grantor to any Secured Party
now or hereafter existing under the Credit Agreement, this Agreement, the
Guaranty, the Notes, if any, the other Loan Documents and any and all Hedge
Agreements, in each case whether for principal (including reimbursement for
amounts drawn or available to be drawn under Letters of Credit), interest
(including, without limitation, interest that, but for the filing of a petition
in bankruptcy would accrue on such obligations), fees, expenses, increased
costs, indemnification or otherwise (any and all such Obligations being the
"SECURED OBLIGATIONS"); provided that any Hedge Agreement to which a Lender is a
 -------------------    --------                                                
party shall be a Secured Obligation only so long as there are any Borrowings or
Commitments outstanding under the Credit Agreement.  Without limiting the
generality of the foregoing, this Agreement secures the payment of all amounts
that constitute part of the Secured Obligations and would be owed by any Grantor
to the Agent or the Lenders under the Credit Agreement, this Agreement, the
Guaranty, the Notes, if any, and the other Loan Documents but for the fact that
they are unenforceable or not allowable due to the existence of a bankruptcy,
reorganization or similar proceeding.

          SECTION 3.  GRANTORS REMAINS LIABLE.  Anything herein to the contrary
                      -----------------------                                  
notwithstanding, (a) each Grantor shall remain liable under the contracts and
agreements (including, without limitation, the Assigned Agreements) included in
the Collateral to the extent set forth therein to perform all of its duties and
obligations thereunder to the same extent as if this Agreement had not been
executed, (b) the exercise by the Agent of any of the rights hereunder shall not
release any Grantor from any of its duties or obligations under the contracts
and agreements (including, without limitation, the Assigned Agreements) included
in the Collateral and (c) neither the Agent nor any Lender shall have any
obligation or liability under the contracts and agreements (including, without
limitation, the Assigned Agreements) included in the Collateral by reason of
this Agreement, nor shall the Agent or any Lender be obligated to perform any of
the obligations or duties of any Grantor thereunder or to take any action to
collect or enforce any claim for payment assigned hereunder.

Default, without notice to any Grantor, to transfer to or to register in the
name of the Agent or any of its nominees any or all of the Security Collateral

                      -------------------------------------------         
Event of Default shall have occurred and shall be continuing:

               (A)    The Agent may, and upon request of the Agent the Company

     the sole dominion and control of the Agent and subject to the terms of this
     Agreement; and

               (B)    It shall be a term and condition of the L/C Cash
     Collateral Account, notwithstanding any term or condition to the contrary
     in any other agreement relating to the L/C Cash Collateral Account, and
     except as otherwise provided by the provisions of Section 19, that no
     amount (including interest on Collateral Investments (as hereinafter
     defined)) shall be paid or released to or for the account of, or withdrawn
     by or for the account of, the Company or any other Person (other than the
     Agent) from the L/C Cash Collateral Account.

The L/C Cash Collateral Account shall be subject to such applicable laws, and
such applicable regulations of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve

provisions of Section 19, from time to time (a) invest amounts on deposit in the
L/C Cash Collateral Account in such Cash Equivalents in the name of the Agent as
the Company may select and the Agent may approve, and (b) invest interest paid
on the Cash Equivalents referred to in clause (a) above, and reinvest other
proceeds of any such Cash Equivalents that may mature or be sold, in each case
in such Cash Equivalents in the name of the Agent as the Company may select and
the Agent may approve (the Cash Equivalents referred to in clauses (a) and (b)
above being collectively referred to herein as "COLLATERAL INVESTMENTS").
                                                ----------------------    
Interest and proceeds that are not invested or reinvested in Collateral
Investments as provided above shall be deposited and held in the L/C Cash

L/C Cash Collateral Account, no Event of Default exists, the Agent shall, upon
the written request of the Company, release all amounts on deposit in the L/C
Cash Collateral Account to the Company.

          SECTION 7.  REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES.  Each Grantor hereby
                      ------------------------------

               (A)    All of the Equipment and Inventory are located at the

<PAGE>
 
     chattel paper that evidence Receivables, are located at the address
     specified for such Grantor on Schedule III hereto.  None of the Receivables
     or Agreement Collateral is evidenced by a promissory note or other
     instrument.  Such Grantor's federal tax identification number is as set
     forth on Schedule III.

               (B) Such Grantor is the legal and beneficial owner of the
     Collateral free and clear of any Lien, except for Liens permitted under
     Section 6.02(a) of the Credit Agreement.  No effective financing statement
     or other instrument similar in effect covering all or any part of the
     Collateral is on file in any recording office, except such as may have been
     filed in favor of the Agent relating to this Agreement or any other Loan
     Document and except for liens permitted under Section 6.02(a) of the Credit
     Agreement.  As of the date of this Agreement, such Grantor currently
     conducts business only under its own name and, in certain areas and for
     certain operations, the trade names listed on Schedule IV.  Neither such
     Grantor nor any corporate predecessor has, during the preceding five (5)
     years, been known as or used any other corporate or fictitious name, except
     such names as are disclosed on Schedule IV.

               (C) Such Grantor has exclusive possession and control of the
     Equipment and Inventory of such Grantor except for (i) Equipment leased by
     such Grantor as a lessee and Equipment in the possession and control of
     such Grantor's lessees and licensees under written lease and license
     agreements entered into in the ordinary course of business and consistent
     with past practice, (ii) Equipment and Inventory in transit with common or
     other carriers, and (iii) Equipment and Inventory in the possession of a
     bailee, provided that if any bailee is in possession of Equipment and
             --------                                                     
     Inventory with a value in excess of One Million Dollars ($1,000,000), the
     bailee has been notified by the Grantor of the security interests created
     by this Agreement.

               (D) The Pledged Shares have been duly authorized and validly
     issued and are fully paid and non-assessable.  The Pledged Debt of such
     Grantor, if any, is in all respects what it purports to be and represents
     genuine debt owing to such Grantor arising from bona fide transactions
     completed in accordance with the terms and provisions contained in the
     documents delivered to the Agent with respect thereto.

               (E) The pledge of the Pledged Shares and Pledged Debt, if any,
     pursuant to this Agreement creates a valid and first priority perfected
     security interest in the Pledged Shares and the Pledged Debt, respectively,
     subject only to Liens of the type described in clause (a) or (b) of the
     definition of "Permitted Liens" contained in the Credit Agreement.

               (F) The Pledged Shares constitute, as of the Closing Date, all of
     the issued and outstanding shares of stock of the respective issuers
     thereof indicated on Schedule I hereto and owned by the Grantors, and, as
     of the Closing Date, there is no other class of shares issued and
     outstanding of the respective issuers thereof.  The Pledged Debt
     constitutes, as of the Closing Date, all of the notes and instruments
     payable to or owned by such Grantor, except for notes and instruments with
     an outstanding principal amount of less than One Million Dollars
     ($1,000,000) and except for notes and instruments received in the ordinary
     course of business and which such Grantor is not required to deliver to the
     Agent pursuant to Section 8 hereof or of which the Agent has not at any
     time requested possession and which are not a material portion of the
     Collateral either singly or in the aggregate, and the security interest of
     the Agent therein has been duly perfected with first priority.

               (G) Appropriate financing statements have been filed in the
     necessary jurisdictions (or have been executed and delivered by the
     applicable Grantor in appropriate form for filing in the necessary
     jurisdictions) with respect to the Collateral as to which financing

                                       7
<PAGE>
 
     statements are required to be filed, so that the security interests granted
     pursuant to this Agreement, to the extent they may be perfected by filing
     financing statements in the necessary jurisdictions, constitute (or in the
     case of any such financing statements not yet filed, will constitute upon
     filing thereof) valid, continuing and perfected security interests in and
     liens on the Collateral to the extent a security interest can be created
     therein under the Uniform Commercial Code as in effect in the applicable
     jurisdictions in the United States, securing the payment of the Secured
     Obligations, subject only to Liens of the type described in clause (a) or
     (b) of the definition of "Permitted Liens" contained in the Credit
     Agreement.  All other actions necessary or requested by the Agent to
     perfect and protect such security interest in each item of Collateral
     (including, without limitation, the actions described in clauses (i) and
     (ii) of Section 8(a) to the extent required therein) have been duly taken
     to the extent a security interest can be created therein under the Uniform
     Commercial Code as in effect in the applicable jurisdictions of the United
     States.

               (H) No authorization, approval or other action by, and no notice
     to or filing with, any Governmental Authority (other than such
     authorizations, approvals and other actions as have already been taken or
     are in full force and effect) is required (A) for the pledge of the
     Security Collateral, for the assignment of the Assigned Agreements, for the
     grant of the security interest in the Collateral held by such Grantor
     hereby or for the execution, delivery or performance of this Agreement by
     such Grantor, or (B) for the exercise by the Agent of the voting rights in
     the Pledged Shares or of any other rights or remedies in respect of the
     Collateral hereunder except as may be required in connection with any
     disposition of Collateral consisting of securities by laws affecting the
     offering and sale of securities generally and except as may be required for
     the Agent to receive payments directly from the United States government
     under the Assignment of Claims Act, 31 U.S.C. (S) 3727 and 41 U.S.C. (S) 15
     (the "ASSIGNMENT OF CLAIMS ACT").
           ------------------------   

               (I) The Inventory has been produced by such Grantor in compliance
     with all requirements of the Fair Labor Standards Act.

               (J) To the best of such Grantor's knowledge, each trademark,
     copyright and patent material to the operations of the Company and its
     Subsidiaries taken as a whole is validly subsisting and is presently in
     good standing.

               (K) Except as has not had and would not reasonably be expected to
     have a Material Adverse Effect, no claim has been made by a third party
     that any Intellectual Property is invalid or unenforceable.

               (L) Except as has not had and would not reasonably be expected to
     have a Material Adverse Effect, no claim has been made that the use of any
     Intellectual Property does or may violate the rights of any third party.

               (M) In connection with the sale in May 1990 of the business of
     Whittaker Technical Products, Inc. and/or its predecessor entities located
     in Pawcatuck, Connecticut to Yardney Technical Products, Inc. (the
     "BUYER"), (i) a conveyance of all the rights in all of the contracts
      -----

          SECTION 8.  FURTHER ASSURANCES.
                      ------------------ 

               (A)    Each Grantor agrees that from time to time, at the expense
     of such Grantor, such Grantor will promptly execute and deliver all further
     instruments and documents, and take all further action, that may be
     necessary or desirable, or that the Agent may reasonably request, in order
     to perfect, protect and maintain the priority of any pledge, assignment or
     security interest granted or purported to be granted hereby or to enable
     the Agent to exercise and enforce its rights and remedies hereunder with

     Assigned Agreement and each of its records pertaining to the Collateral
     with a legend, in form and substance satisfactory to the Agent, indicating
     that such document, chattel paper, Related Contract, Assigned Agreement or
     Collateral is subject to the security interest granted hereby; (ii) if any
     Collateral shall be evidenced by, or if such Grantor shall otherwise be the
     payee under, a promissory note or other instrument or chattel paper having
     a principal balance in excess of One Million Dollars ($1,000,000), deliver
     and pledge to the Agent hereunder such note or instrument or chattel paper
     duly indorsed and accompanied by duly executed instruments of transfer or
     assignment, all in form and substance satisfactory to the Agent; and (iii)
     execute and file such financing or continuation statements, or amendments
     thereto, and such other instruments or notices, as may be necessary or
     desirable, or as the Agent may reasonably request, in order to perfect and
     preserve, with the required priority, the pledge, assignment and security
     interest granted or purported to be granted hereby.

               (B)    Each Grantor hereby authorizes the Agent to file one or
     more financing or continuation statements, and amendments thereto, relating
     to all or any part of the Collateral without the signature of such Grantor
     where permitted by law. A photocopy or other reproduction of this Agreement
     or any financing statement covering the Collateral or any part thereof
     shall be sufficient as a financing statement where permitted by law.

               (C)    Each Grantor will furnish to the Agent, from time to time,
     statements and schedules further identifying and describing the Collateral
     and such other reports in connection with the Collateral as the Agent may
     reasonably request, all in reasonable detail.

               (D)    Each Grantor agrees that, at the request of the Agent,
     following the occurrence and during the continuance of an Event of Default,
     such Grantor will execute any and all documents, notices or instruments as
     may be necessary or desirable, or as the Agent may reasonably request, to
     direct the United States government to pay to the Agent, for the account of
     the Agent and the Lenders, all amounts otherwise payable to the Grantors
     under the Assignment of Claims Act.

               (E)    Each Grantor shall (i) preserve and maintain all material
     rights in the Intellectual Property, and (ii) upon the occurrence and
     during the continuation of an Event of Default, use its best efforts to
     obtain any consents, waivers or agreements necessary to enable the Agent to
     exercise its remedies with respect to the Intellectual Property.  No
     Grantor shall abandon any material right to file a copyright, patent or
     trademark application nor shall any Grantor abandon any material pending
     copyright, patent or trademark application, or material Copyright, Patent
     or Trademark without the prior written consent of Agent.

          SECTION 9.  AS TO EQUIPMENT AND INVENTORY.
                      ----------------------------- 

               (A)    Each Grantor shall keep the Equipment and Inventory of
     such Grantor (other than (i) Inventory sold in the ordinary course of
     business, and (ii) Equipment and Inventory with an aggregate value that
     does not exceed $500,000) at the places therefor specified on Schedule II
     or, upon prior written notice to the Agent, at such other places in a
     jurisdiction where all action required by Section 8 shall have been taken
     with respect to the Equipment and Inventory.

               (B)    Each Grantor shall cause the Equipment material to its
     operations to be maintained and preserved in good repair and working order,
     ordinary wear and tear and damage due to casualty excepted, and make or
     cause to be made all appropriate repairs, renewals and replacements
     thereof, to the extent not obsolete, and consistent with past practice of
     such Grantor, as quickly as practicable after the occurrence of any loss or
     damage thereto, that are necessary or desirable to such end.  Each Grantor
     shall promptly furnish to the Agent a statement respecting any material
     loss or damages to any of the Equipment or Inventory.

          SECTION 10. INSURANCE.
                      --------- 

               (A)    Each Grantor (or the Company, on behalf of each Grantor)
     shall, at its own expense, maintain insurance with respect to the Equipment
     and Inventory of such Grantor with financially sound and reputable insurers
     in such amounts, against such risks and in such form as is consistent with
     past practice and as is usually carried by companies engaged in similar
     businesses and owning similar properties in the same general areas in which
     such Grantor operates.  Each policy for property damage insurance shall
     provide for all losses (except for losses of less than $5,000,000 per
     occurrence) to be paid directly to the Agent.  Each such policy shall in
     addition (i) name such Grantor (or the Company) and the Agent as insured
     parties thereunder (without any representation or warranty by or obligation
     upon the Agent) as their interests may appear, (ii) in the case of property
     damage insurance, contain the agreement by the insurer that any loss
     thereunder shall be payable to the Agent notwithstanding any action,
     inaction or breach of representation or warranty by such Grantor, (iii) not
     contain any provision providing for recourse against the Agent for payment
     of premiums or other amounts with respect thereto and (iv) provide that at
     least 10 days' prior written notice of cancellation or of lapse shall be
     given to the Agent by the insurer.  Each Grantor (or the Company) shall, if
     so requested by the Agent, deliver to the Agent original or duplicate
     policies of such insurance and, as often as the Agent may reasonably
     request, a report of a reputable insurance broker with respect to such
     insurance.  Further, each Grantor (or the Company) shall, at the request of
     the Agent, duly exercise and deliver instruments of assignment of such
     insurance policies to comply with the requirements of this Section 10 and
     cause the insurers to acknowledge notice of such assignment.

               (B)    Reimbursement under any liability insurance maintained by
     such Grantor pursuant to this Section 10 may be paid directly to the Person
     who shall have incurred liability covered by such insurance.  In case of
     any loss involving damage to Equipment or Inventory when subsection (c) of
     this Section 10 is not applicable, such Grantor shall make or cause to be
     made the necessary repairs to or replacements of such Equipment or
     Inventory, and any proceeds of insurance maintained by such Grantor
     pursuant to this Section 10 and received by the Agent shall be released to
     such Grantor as reimbursement for the costs of such repairs or
     replacements.

               (C)    At the request of the Agent, upon the occurrence and
     during the continuance of any Event of Default, all insurance payments in
     respect of such Equipment or Inventory shall be paid to and applied by the
     Agent as specified in Section 19(b) hereof.

     prior written notice to the Agent, at such other locations in a
     jurisdiction where all actions required by Section 8 shall have been taken
     with respect to the Collateral.  Each Grantor will hold and preserve such
     records, Assigned Agreements and chattel paper and will permit
     representatives of the Agent at any time during normal business hours to
     inspect and make abstracts from such records and chattel paper.

               (B)     Except as otherwise provided in this subsection (b), each
     Grantor shall continue to collect in accordance with its customary
     practice, at its own expense, all amounts due or to become due such Grantor
     under the Receivables and, prior to the occurrence of an Event of Default,
     such Grantor shall have the right to adjust, settle or compromise the
     amount or payment of any Account, or release wholly or partly any account
     debtor or obligor thereof, or allow any credit or discount thereon, all in
     accordance with its customary practices.  In connection with such
     collections, each Grantor may take (and, upon the occurrence and during the
     continuation of an Event of Default, at the Agent's direction, shall take)
     such action as such Grantor or the Agent may deem necessary or advisable to
     enforce collection of the Receivables; provided, however, that the Agent
                                            --------  -------                
     shall have the right, upon the occurrence and during the continuance of an
     Event of Default, and upon written notice to such Grantor of its intention
     to do so, to notify the obligors under any Receivables of the assignment of
     such Receivables to the Agent and to direct such obligors to make payment
     of all amounts due or to become due to such Grantor thereunder directly to
     the Agent and, upon such notification and at the expense of such Grantor,
     to enforce collection of any such Receivables, and to adjust, settle or
     compromise the amount or payment thereof, in the same manner and to the
     same extent as such Grantor might have done.  After receipt by such Grantor
     or Grantors of the notice from the Agent referred to in the proviso to the
                                                                 -------       
     preceding sentence, (i) all amounts and proceeds (including instruments)
     received by such Grantor in respect of the Receivables shall be received in
     trust for the benefit of the Agent hereunder, shall be segregated from
     other funds of such Grantor and shall be forthwith paid over to the Agent
     in the same form as so received (with any necessary indorsement) to be
     applied as provided by Section 19(b) and (ii) such Grantor shall not
     adjust, settle or compromise the amount or payment of any Receivable,
     release wholly or partly any obligor thereof, or allow any credit or
     discount thereon.

                       ----------------------------- 

               (A)     So long as no Event of Default shall have occurred and be

                       (i)   Each Grantor shall be entitled to exercise any and
          all voting and other consensual rights pertaining to the Security
          Collateral or any part thereof for any purpose not inconsistent with
          the terms of this Agreement or the other Loan Documents; provided,

          however, that no Grantor shall exercise or refrain from exercising 
          -------
          any such right if such action would have a material adverse effect on
          the value of the Security Collateral or the benefits of this Agreement
          to the Secured Parties.

          retain any and all dividends and interest paid in respect of the
          Security Collateral; provided, however, that any and all dividends and
                               --------  -------
          interest paid or payable other than in cash in respect of, and any and

          any Security Collateral shall be forthwith delivered to the Agent to
          hold as, Security Collateral and shall, if received by such Grantor,
          be received in trust for the benefit of the Agent, be segregated from
          the other property or funds of such Grantor and be forthwith delivered
          to the Agent as Security Collateral in the same form as so received
          (with any necessary indorsement).

                       (iii) The Agent shall execute and deliver (or cause to be
          executed and delivered) to any Grantor all such proxies and other
          instruments as such Grantor may reasonably request for the purpose of
          enabling such Grantor to exercise the voting and other rights that it
          is entitled to exercise pursuant to clause (i) above and to receive
          the dividends or interest payments that it is authorized to receive
          and retain pursuant to clause (ii) above.

               (B)     Upon the occurrence and during the continuance of an
     Event of Default and after notice to the Company from the Agent or the
     Required Lenders:

                       (i)   All rights of each Grantor (x) to exercise or
          refrain from exercising the voting and other consensual rights that it
          would otherwise be entitled to exercise pursuant to Section 12(a)(i)
          and (y) to receive the dividends and interest payments that it would
          otherwise be authorized to receive and retain pursuant to Section
          12(a)(ii) shall cease, and all such rights shall thereupon become
          vested in the Agent, so long as an Event of Default shall continue,
          which shall thereupon have the sole right to exercise or refrain from
          exercising such voting and other consensual rights and to receive and
          hold as Security Collateral such dividends and interest payments. Each
          Grantor shall execute and deliver such instruments evidencing such
          Grantor's right to exercise such voting rights as the Agent may
          request.

               (ii)    All dividends and interest payments that are received by
          any Grantor contrary to the provisions of paragraph (i) of this
          Section 12(b) shall be received in trust for the benefit of the Agent,

     pledge hereunder, immediately upon its acquisition (directly or indirectly)
     thereof, any and all such additional shares of stock or other securities

          SECTION 18.  THE AGENT'S DUTIES.  The powers conferred on the Agent
                       ------------------                                    
hereunder are solely to protect its interest in the Collateral and shall not
impose any duty upon it to exercise any such powers.  Except for the safe
custody of any Collateral in its possession and the accounting for moneys
actually received by it hereunder, the Agent shall have no duty as to any
Collateral, as to ascertaining or taking action with respect to calls,
conversions, exchanges, maturities, tenders or other matters relative to any
Security Collateral, whether or not the Agent or any Lender has or is deemed to
have knowledge of such matters, or as to the taking of any necessary steps to
preserve rights against any parties or any other rights pertaining to any
Collateral.  The Agent shall be deemed to have exercised reasonable care in the
custody and preservation of any Collateral in its possession if such Collateral
is accorded treatment substantially equal to that which NationsBank accords its
own property.

          SECTION 19.  REMEDIES.  If any Event of Default shall have occurred
                       --------

     addition to all other rights and remedies provided for herein or otherwise
     available to it, all the rights and remedies of a secured party upon
     default under the Uniform Commercial Code in effect in the State of New
     York at such time (the "N.Y. UNIFORM COMMERCIAL CODE") (whether or not the
                             ----------------------------                      
     N.Y. Uniform Commercial Code applies to the affected Collateral) and also
     may (i) require each Grantor to, and each Grantor hereby agrees that it
     will at its expense and upon request of the Agent forthwith, assemble all
     or part of the Collateral as directed by the Agent and make it available to
     the Agent at a place to be designated by the Agent that is reasonably
     convenient to both parties and (ii) without notice except as specified
     below, sell the Collateral or any part thereof in one or more parcels at
     public or private sale, at any of the Agent's offices or elsewhere, for
     cash, on credit or for future delivery, and upon such other terms as the
     Agent may deem commercially reasonable.  Each Grantor agrees that, to the
     extent notice of sale shall be required by law, at least 10 days' notice to
     such Grantor of the time and place of any public sale or the time after
     which any private sale is to be made shall constitute reasonable
     notification.  The Agent shall not be obligated to make any sale of
     Collateral regardless of notice of sale having been given.  The Agent may
     adjourn any public or private sale from time to time by announcement at the
     time and place fixed therefor, and such sale may, without further notice,
     be made at the time and place to which it was so adjourned.

               (B) All cash proceeds received by the Agent in respect of any
     sale of, collection from, or other realization upon all or any part of the
     Collateral may, in the discretion of the Agent, be held by the Agent as
     collateral for, and/or then or at any time thereafter applied (after
     payment of any amounts payable to the Agent pursuant to Section 21) in
     whole or in part by the Agent for the ratable benefit of the Lenders
     against, all or any part of the Secured Obligations in such order as the
     Agent shall elect.  Any surplus of such cash or cash proceeds held by the
     Agent and remaining after payment in full of all the Secured Obligations
     shall be promptly paid over to the Company or to whomsoever may be lawfully
     entitled to receive such surplus.

               (C) The Agent may exercise any and all rights and remedies of any
     Grantor under or in connection with the Assigned Agreements or otherwise in
     respect of the Collateral, including, without limitation, any and all
     rights of any Grantor to demand or otherwise require payment of any amount
     under, or performance of any provision of, any Assigned Agreement.

               (d) All payments received by any of the Grantors under or in
     connection with any Assigned Agreement or otherwise in respect of the
     Collateral shall be received in trust for the benefit of the Agent, shall
     be segregated from other funds of such Grantor and shall be

                                      14
<PAGE>
 
     forthwith paid over to the Agent in the same form as so received (with any
     necessary indorsement).

               (E) The Agent may, without notice to any Grantor except as
     required by law and at any time or from time to time, charge, set-off and
     otherwise apply all or any part of the Secured Obligations against the L/C
     Cash Collateral Account or any part thereof.

          SECTION 20.  REGISTRATION RIGHTS.  If the Agent shall determine to
                       -------------------                                  
exercise its right to sell all or any of the Pledged Shares pursuant to Section
19, each Grantor agrees that, upon request of the Agent, such Grantor will, at
its own expense:

               (A) execute and deliver, and cause each issuer of the Pledged
     Shares contemplated to be sold and the directors and officers thereof to
     execute and deliver, all such instruments and documents, and do or cause to
     be done all such other acts and things, as may be necessary or, in the
     opinion of the Agent, advisable to register such Pledged Shares under the

     become effective and to remain effective for such period as prospectuses
     are required by law to be furnished and to make all amendments and
     supplements thereto and to the related prospectus that, in the opinion of
     the Agent, are necessary or advisable, all in conformity with the
     requirements of the Securities Act and the rules and regulations of the

     as may be necessary or, in the opinion of the Agent, advisable to enable
     the Agent to effect the sale of such Pledged Shares; and

     be necessary to make such sale of the Pledged Shares or any part thereof

          Each Grantor acknowledges the impossibility of ascertaining the amount
of damages that would be suffered by the Agent or the Lenders by reason of the
failure by any Grantor to perform any of the covenants contained in this Section
and, consequently, agrees that, if any Grantor shall fail to perform any of such
covenants, such Grantor or the Company shall pay, as liquidated damages and not
as a penalty, an amount equal to the value of the Pledged Shares on the date the
Agent shall demand compliance with this Section.

                       -----------------------------

Agreement (including, without limitation, enforcement of this

                                      15

Agreement), except claims, losses or liabilities resulting from such Indemnified
Party's gross negligence or willful misconduct as determined by a final judgment
of a court of competent jurisdiction.

          (B)   Each Grantor agrees, jointly and severally, to pay to the Agent,
upon written demand, the amount of any and all reasonable expenses, including
the reasonable fees and expenses of its counsel and of any experts and agents,
that the Agent may incur in connection with (i) the administration of this
Agreement, (ii) the custody, preservation, use or operation of, or the sale of,
collection from or other realization upon, any of the Collateral, (iii) the
exercise or enforcement of any of the rights of the Agent or the Lenders
hereunder or (iv) the failure by such Grantor to perform or observe any of the
provisions hereof.

          (C)   Each Grantor shall pay (i) all taxes, assessments and other
charges of Governmental Authorities imposed upon any of the Collateral before
any material penalty or interest accrues thereon, and (ii) all claims
(including, without limitation, claims for labor, services, materials and
supplies) for sums materially adversely affecting the Collateral, which have
become due and payable and which by law have or may become a Lien (other than a
Permitted Lien) upon any of the Collateral prior to the time when any material
penalty or fine shall be incurred with respect thereto; provided, that no such
                                                        --------              
taxes, assessments and charges of Governmental Authorities referred to in clause
(i) above or claims referred to in clause (ii) above need to be paid if being
contested in good faith by appropriate proceedings promptly instituted and
diligently conducted and enforcement thereof is stayed and if a reserve or other
appropriate provision required in conformity with GAAP shall have been made
therefor and if, at the request of the Agent, it posts a bond or other form of
indemnity satisfactory to the Agent in the amount of such contested taxes,
assessments and charges plus any applicable interest and penalties.

          SECTION 22.  SECURITY INTEREST ABSOLUTE.  The obligations of each 
                       --------------------------       
Grantor under this Agreement are independent of the Secured Obligations, and a
separate action or actions may be brought and prosecuted against each Grantor to
enforce this Agreement, irrespective of whether any action is brought against
the Company or whether the Company is joined in any such action or actions. All
rights of the Agent and the pledge, assignment and security interest hereunder,
and all obligations of each Grantor hereunder, shall be absolute and
unconditional, irrespective of:

               (A)   any lack of validity or enforceability of any Loan Document
     or any other agreement or instrument relating thereto;

               (B)   any change in the time, manner or place of payment of, or
     in any other term of, all or any of the Secured Obligations or any other
     amendment or waiver of or any consent to any departure from any Loan
     Document, including, without limitation, any increase in the Secured
     Obligations resulting from the extension of additional credit to the
     Company or any of its Subsidiaries or otherwise;

               (C)   any taking, exchange, release or non-perfection of any
     other collateral, or any taking, release or amendment or waiver of or
     consent to departure from any guaranty, for all or any of the Secured
     Obligations;

               (D)   any manner of application of collateral, or proceeds
     thereof, to all or any of the Secured Obligations, or any manner of sale or
     other disposition of any collateral for all or any of the Secured
     Obligations or any other assets of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries;

               (E)   any change, restructuring or termination of the corporate
     structure or existence of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries; or

                                     16                              
<PAGE>
 
               (F) any other circumstance that might otherwise constitute a
     defense available to, or a discharge of, such Grantor or a third party
     grantor of a security interest.

          SECTION 23.  AMENDMENTS; WAIVERS; ETC.  No amendment or waiver of any
                       ------------------------                                
provision of this Agreement, and no consent to any departure by any Grantor
herefrom, shall in any event be effective unless the same shall be in writing
and signed by the Agent and each Grantor, and then such waiver or consent shall
be effective only in the specific instance and for the specific purpose for
which given; provided, however, that any amendment to this Agreement that is in
             --------  -------                                                 
substantially the same form as Exhibit K to the Credit Agreement shall be
effective when signed by only the Agent and the Additional Grantor (as defined
therein).  No failure on the part of the Agent to exercise, and no delay in
exercising any right hereunder, shall operate as a waiver thereof; nor shall any
single or partial exercise of any such right preclude any other or further
exercise thereof or the exercise of any other right.

          SECTION 24.  ADDRESSES FOR NOTICES.  All notices and other
                       ---------------------

address as shall be designated by such party in a written notice to each other
party complying as to delivery with the terms of this Section.  All such notices
and other communications shall, when mailed, telecopied, telegraphed, telexed or
cabled, respectively, be effective when deposited in the mails, telecopied,
delivered to the telegraph company, confirmed by telex answerback or delivered

the Collateral and shall (a) remain in full force and effect until the later of
the payment in full in cash of the Secured Obligations or the termination of the
Commitments of the Lenders, (b) be binding upon each Grantor, its successors and
assigns and (c) inure, together with the rights and remedies of the Agent
hereunder, to the benefit of the Agent, the Lenders and their respective
successors, transferees and assigns.  Without limiting the generality of the
foregoing clause (c), any Lender may assign or otherwise transfer all or any
portion of its rights and obligations under the Credit Agreement (including,
without limitation, all or any portion of its Commitment, the Advances owing to
it and the Notes, if any, held by it) to any other Person, and such other Person
shall thereupon become vested with all the benefits in respect thereof granted
to such Lender herein or otherwise, in each case as provided in Section 9.07 of
the Credit Agreement.

          SECTION 26.  TERMINATION.  Upon the payment in full of the Secured
                       -----------                                          
Obligations and the termination of the Commitments of the Lenders, the security
interest granted hereby shall terminate and all rights to the Collateral as
shall not have been sold or otherwise applied pursuant to the terms hereof shall
revert to the applicable Grantor.  Upon the termination of any such security
interest, or upon the Agent's release of any of the Collateral pursuant to
Section 9.01 of the Credit Agreement, the Agent shall promptly return to the
applicable Grantor, at such Grantor's expense, such of the Collateral (and, in
the case of a release, such of the released Collateral) held by the Agent as
shall not have been sold or otherwise applied pursuant to the terms hereof.  The
Agent will, at such Grantor's expense, execute and deliver to the Agent such
other documents as the Agent shall reasonably request to evidence such
termination or release, as the case may be.

          SECTION 27.  GOVERNING LAW; TERMS.  This Agreement shall be governed
                       --------------------

(as hereinafter defined) that becomes a party to this Agreement, a "GUARANTOR"
                                                                    --------- 
and, collectively, the "GUARANTORS"), in favor of the financial institutions

Credit Agreement, the "AGENT") for the Lenders.
                       -----                   

          PRELIMINARY STATEMENT.  The Lenders and the Agent are parties to a
Credit Agreement dated as of January 23, 1995 (said Agreement, as it may
hereafter be amended, supplemented or otherwise modified from time to time,
being the "CREDIT AGREEMENT"; the terms defined therein and not otherwise
           ----------------                                              
defined herein being used herein as therein defined) with Whittaker Corporation,
a Delaware corporation (the "BORROWER").  The Guarantors will derive substantial
                             --------                                           
direct and indirect benefit from the transactions contemplated by the Credit
Agreement.  It is a condition precedent to the making of Advances and the
issuance of Letters of Credit by the Lenders under the Credit Agreement that the
Guarantors shall have executed and delivered this Guaranty.

          NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the premises and in order to
induce the Lenders to make Advances and issue Letters of Credit under the Credit
Agreement, the Guarantors hereby agree, jointly and severally, as follows:

          SECTION 1. GUARANTY.  Each Guarantor, jointly and severally, hereby
                     --------                                                
unconditionally guarantees the punctual payment when due, whether at stated
maturity, by acceleration or otherwise, of all Obligations of the Borrower now
or hereafter existing under the Credit Agreement, the Notes, if any, and each
other Loan Document and under each Hedge Agreement to which any Lender is a
party, including in each case any extensions, modifications, substitutions,
amendments and renewals thereof, including in each case whether for principal
(including reimbursement for amounts drawn under Letters of Credit), interest,
fees, expenses, indemnification or otherwise (such Obligations being the
                                                                        
"GUARANTEED OBLIGATIONS"), and agrees to pay any and all expenses (including
- - -----------------------                                                     
reasonable counsel fees and expenses) incurred by the Agent or the Lenders in
enforcing any rights under this Guaranty; provided that any Hedge Agreement to
                                          --------                            
which a Lender is a party shall be a Guaranteed Obligation only so long as there
are any Borrowings or Commitments outstanding under the Credit Agreement; and
provided further, that each Guarantor and, by acceptance hereof, the Agent and
- - -------- -------                                                              
each Lender hereby confirms that it is the intention of all such parties that
the guarantee by such Guarantor pursuant to this Guaranty not constitute a
fraudulent transfer or conveyance for purposes of Title 11 of the U.S. Code, the
Uniform Fraudulent Conveyance Act, the Uniform Fraudulent Transfer Act or any
similar federal or state law.  To effectuate the foregoing intention, the
obligations of each Guarantor under this guaranty shall be limited to the
maximum amount as will, after giving effect to all other liabilities of such
Guarantor (including, but not limited to, contingent liabilities, but excluding
the liabilities of such Guarantor hereunder) and after giving effect to any
collections from or payments made by or on behalf of any other guarantor in
respect of the obligations of such other Guarantor under this Guaranty or
pursuant to Section
<PAGE>
 
8 hereof, result in the obligations of such Guarantor under this guaranty not
constituting such fraudulent transfer or conveyance.  Without limiting the
generality of the foregoing (but subject to the preceding sentence), each
Guarantor's liability shall extend to all amounts that constitute part of the
Guaranteed Obligations and would be owed by the Borrower to the Agent and the
Lenders under the Loan Documents but for the fact that they are unenforceable or
not allowable due to the existence of a bankruptcy, reorganization or similar
proceeding involving any Loan Party.

          SECTION 2. GUARANTY ABSOLUTE. Each Guarantor guarantees that the
                     -----------------                                     
Guaranteed Obligations will be paid strictly in accordance with the terms of the
Loan Documents, regardless of any law, regulation or order now or hereafter in
effect in any jurisdiction affecting any of such terms or the rights of the
Agent or the Lenders with respect thereto.  The Obligations of the Guarantors
under this Guaranty are independent of the Guaranteed Obligations, and a
separate action or actions may be brought and prosecuted against the Guarantors
to enforce this Guaranty, irrespective of whether any action is brought against
the Borrower or whether the Borrower is joined in any such action or actions.
The liability of each Guarantor under this Guaranty shall be absolute and
unconditional, and shall not be affected or released in any way, irrespective
of:

               (A)   any lack of validity or enforceability of the Credit
     Agreement, any other Loan Document or any other agreement or instrument
     relating thereto for any reason, including, without limitation, the
     existence of a bankruptcy, reorganization or similar proceeding involving
     any Loan Party;

               (B)   any change in the time, manner or place of payment of, or
     in any other term of, all or any of the Guaranteed Obligations or any of
     the Loan Documents, or any other taking, release, amendment or waiver of or
     any consent to any departure from the Credit Agreement, any other Loan
     Document or any other guaranty of any or all of the Guaranteed Obligations,
     including, without limitation, any increase in the Guaranteed Obligations
     resulting from the extension of additional credit to any Loan Party or
     otherwise;

               (C)   any enforcement of any Loan Document, including the taking,
     exchange, holding, sale, additional guarantee or other disposition of any
     Collateral, or any amendment, alteration, exchange, substitution, transfer,
     enforcement, waiver, subordination, termination or release of any
     Collateral or such guaranties, or non-perfection of any Liens created by
     any Collateral Document, or any consent to departure from any such guaranty
     for all or any of the Guaranteed Obligations;

               (D)   any refusal of payment by the Agent or any Lender, in whole
     or in part, from any obligor or guarantor in connection with any of the
     Guaranteed Obligations, whether or not with notice to, or further assent
     by, or any reservation of rights against, any Guarantor;

               (E)   any change, restructuring or termination of the corporate
     structure or existence of any Loan Party;

               (F)   any other circumstance which might otherwise constitute a
     defense available to, or a discharge of, any Loan Party or any other
     guarantor of the Guaranteed Obligations;

               (G)   any manner of application of any Collateral, or proceeds
     thereof, to all or any of the Guaranteed Obligations, or any manner of sale
     or other disposition of any Collateral for all or any of the Guaranteed
     Obligations or any other assets of any Loan Party; or


                                       2
<PAGE>
 
               (H)   any modification, compounding, compromise, settlement,
     release by any lender or any other Person (or by operation of the law or
     otherwise), collection or other liquidation of the Obligations or the
     liability of any Loan Party, or of the Collateral, in whole or in part.

          This Guaranty shall continue to be effective or be reinstated, as the
case may be, if at any time any payment of any of the Guaranteed Obligations is
rescinded or must otherwise be returned by any Lender or any other Person upon
the insolvency, bankruptcy or reorganization of any Loan Party or otherwise, all
as though such payment had not been made.

          SECTION 3. WAIVERS. Each Guarantor hereby waives, to the extent
                     -------                                              
permitted by applicable law:

               (A)   promptness, diligence, notice of acceptance and any other
     notice with respect to any of the Guaranteed Obligations or any other
     obligations under the Loan Documents or this Guaranty;

               (B)   any requirement that the Agent or any Lender or any other
     Person protect, secure or insure any Lien or any property subject thereto
     or exhaust any right or take any action against any Loan Party or any other
     Person or any Collateral;

               (C)   any defense arising by reason of any claim or defense based
     upon an election of remedies by any Lender which in any manner impairs,
     reduces, releases or otherwise adversely affects its subrogation,
     contribution or reimbursement rights (if any) or other rights (if any) to
     proceed against any Loan Party or any other Person or any Collateral; and

               (D)   any duty on the part of the Agent or any Lender to disclose
     to such Guarantor any matter, fact or thing relating to the business,
     operation or condition of any Loan Party and its assets now know or
     hereafter known by the Agent or such Lender.

          SECTION 4. WAIVER OF SUBROGATION; SUBORDINATION.
                     ------------------------------------ 

               (A)   Until all the Guaranteed Obligations and all other amounts
     payable under this Guaranty shall have been paid in full and the obligation
     of the Lenders to make Advances and issue Letters of Credit shall have
     expired or terminated (and except as otherwise provided in Section 8), each
     Guarantor (i) agrees that it shall not enforce or otherwise exercise any
     right of subrogation to any of the rights of the Agent or any Lender
     against the Borrower or any right of reimbursement or contribution or
     similar right against the Borrower, any endorser or any other guarantor of
     all or any part of the Guaranteed Obligations or any guarantor thereof and
     (ii) waives the benefit of, and any right to participate in, any security
     or collateral given to the Agent or any Lender to secure payment of the
     Guaranteed Obligations.  If any amount shall be paid to any Guarantor on
     account of such subrogation, reimbursement or contribution rights at any
     time prior to the later of (x) the payment in full of the Guaranteed
     Obligations and all other amounts payable under this Guaranty and (y) the
     expiration or termination of the obligation of the Lenders to make Advances
     and issue Letters of Credit, such amount shall be held in trust for the
     benefit of the Lenders and shall forthwith be paid to the Agent to be
     credited and applied against the Guaranteed Obligations, whether matured or
     unmatured, in accordance with the terms of the Credit Agreement or to be
     held by the Agent as collateral security for any Guaranteed Obligations
     thereafter existing.  Each Guarantor hereby agrees that it shall not, so
     long as an Event of Default has occurred and is continuing and until all
     the Guaranteed Obligations and all other amounts payable under this
     Guaranty shall have been paid in full and the obligation of the Lenders to


                                       3
<PAGE>
 
     make Advances and issue Letters of Credit shall have expired or terminated,
     assert any claim or counterclaim it may have against the Borrower or setoff
     any of its obligations to the Borrower against any obligations of the
     Borrower to it.

               (B)   Each Guarantor hereby agrees that any indebtedness of the
     Borrower now or hereafter owing to such Guarantor (the "SUBORDINATED DEBT")
                                                             -----------------  
     is hereby subordinated to all of the Guaranteed Obligations and all other
     amounts payable under this Guaranty, whether heretofore, now or hereafter
     created, and that without the prior consent of the Agent, the Subordinated
     Debt shall not be paid in whole or in part until the Guaranteed Obligations
     and all other amounts payable under this Guaranty have been paid in full
     and the Credit Agreement has been terminated and is of no further force or
     effect, except that payments of principal and interest on the Subordinated
     Debt shall be permitted (i) so long as no Event of Default shall have
     occurred and be continuing and (ii) during the continuance of any Event of
     Default so long as the Agent has not provided the Company and each
     Guarantor with written notice of default stating that such payment shall no
     longer be permitted, but in either of the foregoing events only to the
     extent such payments would not render the Borrower incapable of performing
     the Guaranteed Obligations.  Each Guarantor agrees that it will not accept
     any payment of or on account of any Subordinated Debt at any time in
     contravention of the foregoing.  At the request of the Agent, following the
     occurrence and during the continuance of an Event of Default, each
     Guarantor hereby agrees to direct the Borrower to pay to the Agent, for the
     account of the Agent and the Lenders, all or any part of the Subordinated
     Debt and any amount so paid to the Agent shall be applied to payment of the
     Guaranteed Obligations and all other amounts payable under this Guaranty.
     Each payment on the Subordinated Debt received in violation of any of the
     provisions hereof shall be deemed to have been received as trustee for the
     Agent and shall be paid over to the Agent immediately on account of the
     Guaranteed Obligations, but without otherwise affecting in any manner any
     Guarantor's liability under any of the provisions of this Guaranty.  Each
     Guarantor agrees to file all claims against the Borrower in any bankruptcy
     or other proceeding in which the filing of claims is required by law in
     respect of any Subordinated Debt, and the Agent shall be entitled to all of
     such Guarantor's rights thereunder.  If for any reason any Guarantor fails
     to file such claim at least 30 days prior to the last date on which such
     claim should be filed, the Agent, as such Guarantor's attorney-in-fact, is
     hereby authorized to do so in such Guarantor's name or, in the Agent's
     discretion, to assign such claim to and cause proof of claim to be filed in
     the name of the Agent or its nominee.  In all such cases, whether in
     reorganization, bankruptcy or otherwise, the Person or Persons authorized
     to pay such claim shall pay to the Agent, for the account of the Agent and
     the Lenders, the full amount payable on the claim in the proceeding, and,
     to the full extent necessary for that purpose, each Guarantor hereby
     assigns to the Agent, for the account of the Agent and the Lenders, all of
     such Guarantor's rights to any payments or distributions to which such
     Guarantor otherwise would be entitled.  If the amount so paid is greater
     than such Guarantor's liability hereunder, the Agent will pay the excess
     amount to the party entitled thereto.  In addition, each Guarantor hereby
     appoints the Agent as its attorney-in-fact to exercise all of such
     Guarantor's voting rights in connection with any bankruptcy proceeding or
     any plan for the reorganization of the Borrower.

          SECTION 5. PAYMENTS FREE AND CLEAR OF TAXES, ETC.
                     ------------------------------------- 

               (A)   Any and all payments made by the Guarantors hereunder shall
     be made, in accordance with Section 2.09 of the Credit Agreement, free and
     clear of, and without deduction for, any and all present or future Taxes.
     If any Guarantor shall be required by law to deduct any Taxes from or in
     respect of any sum payable hereunder to any Lender or the Agent, (i) the
     sum payable shall be increased as may be necessary so that after making all
     required deductions (including deductions applicable to additional sums
     payable under this Section 5) such


                                       4
<PAGE>
 
     Lender or the Agent (as the case may be) receives an  amount equal to the
     sum it would have received had no such deductions been made, (ii) such
     Guarantor shall make such deductions and (iii) such Guarantor shall pay the
     full amount deducted to the relevant taxation authority or other authority
     in accordance with applicable law.

               (B)   In addition, each Guarantor agrees to pay any present or
     future Other Taxes.

               (C)   Each Guarantor will indemnify each Lender and the Agent for
     the full amount of Taxes or Other Taxes (including, without limitation, any
     Taxes or Other Taxes imposed by any jurisdiction on amounts payable under
     this Section 5) paid by such Lender or the Agent (as the case may be) and
     any liability (including penalties, interest and expenses) arising
     therefrom or with respect thereto.

               (D)   Each Guarantor shall indemnify the Agent and each Lender
     for the full amount of Taxes and Other Taxes, and for the full amount of
     taxes imposed by any jurisdiction on amounts payable under this Section,
     paid by the Agent or such Lender and any liability (including penalties,
     additions to tax, interest and expenses) arising therefrom or with respect
     thereto. Payments pursuant to this indemnification shall be made within 30
     days from the date such Lender makes written demand therefor setting forth
     in reasonable detail the basis of the Guarantor's obligation to indemnify
     such Lender pursuant to this Section; provided, however, that (i) in the
                                           --------  -------
     case of any Taxes or Other Taxes not required by law to be deducted by the
     applicable Guarantor from or in respect of any sum payable hereunder to the
     Agent or any Lender, such Guarantor shall be obligated to make payment to
     the Agent or such Lender pursuant to this Section (A) in respect of such
     Taxes or Other Taxes only if written demand therefor has been made by the
     Lender within 180 days from the date on which the Lender or the Agent, as
     the case may be, actually makes payment of the Taxes or Other Taxes to the
     relevant taxing authority, and (B) in respect of penalties and additions to
     tax attributable to late payment only to the extent that such penalties or
     additions to tax are accrued after the written demand therefore has been
     made by the Lender and (ii) no Guarantor shall be obligated to pay any
     Taxes or Other Taxes to the extent the Taxes or Other Taxes result from a
     change in the Lender's Applicable Lending Office.

               (E)   Within 30 days after the date of any payment of Taxes
     pursuant to this Section, the applicable Guarantor shall furnish to the
     Agent, at its address referred to in the Credit Agreement, evidence
     reasonably satisfactory to the Agent of payment thereof.  In the case of
     any payment hereunder for the account of the Agent or any Lender which is
     made by any Guarantor through an account or branch outside the United
     States or on behalf of any Guarantor by a payor that is not a United States
     person, if the applicable Guarantor determines that no Taxes are payable in
     respect thereof, such Guarantor shall, except where such mode of payment is
     at the request of the Agent or such Lender, furnish, or cause such payor to
     furnish, to the Agent, at such address, a certificate from the appropriate
     taxing authority or authorities or an opinion of counsel acceptable to the
     Agent, in either case stating that such payment is exempt from Taxes.  For
     purposes of this subsection (d), the terms "UNITED STATES" and "UNITED
                                                 -------------       ------
     STATES PERSON" shall have the meanings specified in Section 7701 of the
     -------------                                                          
     Internal Revenue Code.

               (F)   Without prejudice to the survival of any other agreement of
     any Guarantor hereunder, the agreements and obligations of each Guarantor
     contained in this Section 5 shall survive the payment in full of the
     Guaranteed Obligations and all other amounts payable under this Guaranty.

     has deemed appropriate, made its own credit analysis and decision to enter
     into this Guaranty.

SECTION 4. Eligibility

SECTION 5. Maximum Amount Available for Awards

executive officer of the Company may receive Awards under the Plan in any
calendar year that relate to more than 200,000 shares of Stock.  Shares of
Common Stock may be made available from the authorized but unissued shares of
the Company or from shares reacquired by the Company, including shares purchased
in the open market.  In the event that (i) an Option or Stock Appreciation Right
expires or is terminated unexercised as to any shares of Common Stock covered
thereby or (ii) any Award in respect of shares of Common Stock is


                                       3


<PAGE>
 
forfeited or otherwise cancelled for any reason under the Plan, such shares
shall thereafter be again available for award pursuant to the Plan; provided
that if an Option or Stock Appreciation Right is cancelled, the shares covered
by the cancelled Option or Stock Appreciation Right shall continue to be counted
against the maximum number of shares for which Awards may be made under the Plan
to an executive officer of the Company in a calendar year.  In the event that
any Option or other Award granted hereunder is exercised through the delivery of
shares of Stock, the number of shares of Stock available for Awards under the
Plan shall be increased by the number of shares of Stock surrendered.

     (b)  In the event that the Committee shall determine that any dividend or
other distribution (whether in the form of cash, securities or other property),
recapitalization, reorganization, merger, consolidation, split-up, spinoff,
combination, repurchase or exchange of shares, issuance of warrants or other
rights to purchase Common Stock at a price below fair market value or other
similar corporate event affects the Common Stock such that an adjustment is
required in order to preserve the benefits or potential benefits intended to be
made available under the Plan, then the Committee shall, in its sole discretion,
and in such manner as the Committee may deem equitable, adjust any or all of (1)
the number and kind of shares which may thereafter be made the subject of
Awards, (2) the number and kind of shares (or other securities or assets)
subject to outstanding Awards, and (3) the grant or exercise price with respect
to any Award and/or, if deemed appropriate, make provision for a cash payment to
a Participant or a person who has an outstanding Award; provided that the number
of shares subject to any Award shall always be a whole number.

     (c)  Any shares of Common Stock underlying Substitute Awards shall not,
except in the case of Substitute Awards granted to Employees who are officers or
directors of the Company for purposes of Section 16 of the Securities Exchange
Act of 1934 or any successor section thereto, be counted against the shares of
Common Stock available for Awards under the Plan.

<PAGE>
 
SECTION 6. Stock Options

     (a)  Grant.  Subject to the provisions of the Plan, the  Committee shall
have sole and complete authority to determine the Employees to whom Options
shall be granted, the number of shares to be covered by each Option, the option
price therefor and the conditions and limitations applicable to the exercise of
the Option.  The Committee shall establish the option price at the time each
Option is granted, which price, except in the case of an Option that is a
Substitute Award, shall not be less than 100% of the fair market value of the
Common Stock on the date of grant (determined in accordance with procedures
established by the Committee).  The Committee may authorize the grant of
Incentive Stock Options, Nonqualified Stock Options or both.  In the case of
Incentive Stock Options, the terms and conditions of such grants shall be
subject to and comply with such rules as may be prescribed by Section 422 of the
Code and any implementing regulations.

     (b)  Exercise.  (1)  Each Option shall be exercisable at such times and
subject to such terms and conditions as the Committee may, in its sole
discretion, specify in the applicable Award or thereafter, provided, however,
that in no event may any Option granted hereunder be exercisable after the
expiration of 10 years from the date of such grant.  The Committee may impose
such conditions with respect to the exercise of Options, including any relating
to applicable federal or state securities laws, as it may deem necessary or
advisable.

     (2)  No shares shall be delivered pursuant to any exercise of an Option
until payment in full of the option price therefor is received by the Company.
Such payment may be made in cash, or its equivalent, or, if and to the extent
permitted by the Committee, by exchanging shares of Common Stock owned by the
optionee (which are not the subject of any pledge or other security interest),
or by a combination of the foregoing; provided that the combined value of all
cash and cash equivalents and the fair market value of any such Common Stock so
tendered to the Company, valued (in accordance with procedures established by
the Committee) as of the date of such tender, is at least equal to such option
price.

SECTION 7. Stock Appreciation Rights

     (a)  Subject to the provisions of the Plan, the Committee shall have sole
and complete authority to determine the Employees to whom Stock Appreciation
Rights shall be granted, the number of shares to be covered by each Stock
Appreciation Right, the grant price thereof and the conditions and limitations
applicable to the exercise


                                       5


<PAGE>
 
thereof.  Stock Appreciation Rights may be granted in tandem with an Option, in
addition to an Option or freestanding and unrelated to an Option.  Stock
Appreciation Rights granted in tandem with or in addition to an Option may be
granted either at the same time as the Option or at a later time.  Stock
Appreciation Rights shall not be exercisable earlier than six months after grant
nor after the expiration of 10 years from the date of grant, and except for
Stock Appreciation Rights which are Substitute Awards, shall have a grant price
of not less than 100% of the fair market value of the Common Stock on the date
of grant or, if granted in tandem with an Option but at a later time, on the
date of grant of such Option (determined in accordance with procedures
established by the Committee).

     (b)  Each Stock Appreciation Right shall entitle the Participant to receive
from the Company with respect to each share covered thereby an amount equal to
the excess of the fair market value of a share of Common Stock on the date of
exercise of the Stock Appreciation Right over the grant price, provided that the
Committee may for administrative convenience determine that, for any Stock
Appreciation Right, that is not related to an Incentive Stock Option and that
can be exercised only during limited periods of time in order to satisfy the
conditions of certain rules of the Securities and Exchange Commission, the
exercise of any such Stock Appreciation Right for cash during such limited
period shall be deemed to occur for all purposes hereunder on the day during
such limited period on which the fair market value of the Stock is the highest.
Any such determination by the Committee may be changed by the Committee from
time to time and may govern the exercise of Stock Appreciation Rights granted or
exercised prior to such determination as well as Stock Appreciation Rights
granted or exercised thereafter.  The Committee shall determine upon the
exercise of a Stock Appreciation Right whether such Stock Appreciation Right
shall be settled in cash, shares of Common Stock or a combination of cash and
shares of Common Stock.

SECTION 8. Performance Shares

     (a)  Subject to the provisions of the Plan, the Committee shall have sole
and complete authority to determine the Employees who shall be granted
Performance Shares, the number of Performance Shares to be granted to each
Participant for each Performance Cycle, the Performance Goals for each
Performance Cycle, the duration of each Performance Cycle and the value of each
Performance Share.  There may be more than one Performance Cycle in existence at
any one time, and the durations of Performance Cycles may differ from each
other.


                                       6


<PAGE>
 
     (b)  The Committee shall establish Performance Goals for each Cycle on the
basis of such criteria and to accomplish such objectives as the Committee may
from time to time select.  During any Cycle, the Committee may adjust the
Performance Goals for such Cycle as it deems equitable in recognition of unusual
or nonrecurring events affecting the Corporation or changes in applicable tax
laws or accounting principles or such other factors as the Committee may
determine.

     (c) (1)  The Committee shall, as soon as practicable after the expiration
of each Performance Cycle, determine the number of Performance Shares which have
been earned on the basis of performance in relation to the Performance Goals
established for such Performance Cycle.

     (2)  Payment Values of earned Performance Shares shall be distributed to
the Participant or, if the Participant has died, to the Participant's Designated
Beneficiary, as soon as practicable after the Committee's determination under
paragraph (1) above.  The Committee shall determine whether Payment Values are
to be distributed in the form of cash, shares of Common Stock or a combination
of cash and shares of Common Stock.

SECTION 9. Restricted Stock and Restricted Stock Units

     (a)  Subject to the provisions of the Plan, the Committee shall have sole
and complete authority to determine the Employees to whom shares of Restricted
Stock and Restricted Stock Units shall be granted, the number of shares of
Restricted Stock and the number of Restricted Stock Units to be granted to each
Participant, the duration of the Restricted Period during which, and the
conditions under which, the Restricted Stock and Restricted Stock Units may be
forfeited to the Company, and the other terms and conditions of such Awards.

     (b)  Shares of Restricted Stock and Restricted Stock Units may not be sold,
assigned, transferred, pledged or otherwise encumbered, except as herein
provided, during the Restricted Period.  Certificates issued in respect of
shares of Restricted Stock shall be registered in the name of the Participant
and deposited by him, together with a stock power endorsed in blank, with the
Company or in escrow with an escrow agent designated by the Company.  At the
expiration of the Restricted Period, the Company shall deliver or cause such
certificates to be delivered to the Participant.  Payment for Restricted Stock
Units shall be made by the Corporation in cash, shares of Common Stock or a
combination of cash and shares of Common Stock.

SECTION 10. Other Stock Based Awards



                                       7


<PAGE>
 
     (a)  In addition to Awards granted pursuant to other provisions of the
Plan, subject to the provisions of the Plan, the Committee shall have sole and
complete discretion to authorize the grant to Participants of Stock Unit Awards
which can be in the form of Common Stock or units, the value of which is based,
in whole or in part, on the value of Common Stock.  Subject to the provisions of
the Plan, including Section 10(b) below, Stock Unit Awards shall be subject to
such terms, restrictions, conditions, vesting requirements and payment rules
(all of which are sometimes hereinafter collectively referred to as "rules") as
the Committee may determine in its sole and complete discretion at the time of
grant.  The rules need not be identical for each Stock Unit Award.

     (b)  In the sole and complete discretion of the Committee, a Stock Unit
Award may be granted subject to the following rules:

          (1)  Any shares of Common Stock which are part of a Stock Unit Award
     may not be assigned, sold, transferred, pledged or otherwise encumbered
     prior to the date on which the shares are issued or, if later, the date
     provided by the Committee at the time of grant of the Stock Unit Award.

          (2)  Stock Unit Awards may provide for the payment of cash
     consideration by the person to whom such Award is granted or provide that
     the Award, and any Common Stock to be issued in connection therewith, if
     applicable, shall be delivered without the payment of cash consideration;
     provided that for any Common Stock to be purchased in connection with a
     Stock Unit Award, except in the case of a Stock Unit Award which is a
     Substitute Award, the purchase price shall be at least 50% of the fair
     market value of such Common Stock on the date such Award is granted
     (determined in accordance with procedures established by the Committee).

          (3)  Stock Unit Awards may be made subject, in whole or in part, to
     the achievement of certain performance targets established by the Committee
     at the time of grant.

          (4)  Stock Unit Awards may provide for deferred payment schedules
     and/or vesting over a specified period of employment.

          (5)  In such circumstances as the Committee may deem advisable, the
     Committee may waive or otherwise remove, in whole or in part, any
     restriction or


                                       8


<PAGE>
 
     limitation to which a Stock Unit Award was made subject at the time of
     grant.

     (c)  In the sole and complete discretion of the Committee, an Award,
whether made as a Stock Unit Award under this Section 10 or as an Award granted
pursuant to Sections 6 through 9, may provide the Participant with (i) dividends
or dividend equivalents (payable on a current or deferred basis) and (ii) cash
payments in lieu of or in addition to an Award.

SECTION 11. General Provisions

     (a)  Withholding.  The Corporation shall have the right to deduct from all
amounts paid in cash to a Participant or Designated Beneficiary (whether under
the Plan or otherwise) any taxes that the Corporation reasonably determined to
be required by law to be withheld in respect of Awards to such Participant or
Designated Beneficiary.  In the case of payments of Awards in the form of Common
Stock, at the Committee's discretion the Participant of Designated Beneficiary
may be required by law to pay to the Corporation the amount of any taxes
required to be withheld with respect to such Common Stock, or in lieu thereof,
the Corporation shall have the right to retain (or the Participant or Designated
Beneficiary may be offered the opportunity to elect to tender) the number of
shares of Common Stock whose fair market value, determined in accordance with
procedures established by the Committee, equals the amount that the Corporation
reasonably determined to be required to be withheld.

     (b)  Awards.  Each Award hereunder shall be evidenced by a writing
delivered to the Participant which shall specify the terms and conditions
thereof and any rules applicable thereto, including the effect on such Award of
the death, retirement or other termination of employment of the Participant and
the effect thereon, if any, of a change in control of the Company.

     (c)  Nontransferability.  No Award shall be assignable or transferable, and
no right or interest of any Participant shall be subject to any lien, obligation
or liability of the Participant, except by will or the laws of descent and
distribution, provided, however, that an Award may be transferable, to the
              -----------------                                           
extent set forth in the applicable Award agreement, if the Award is not an
Incentive, (i) such Award agreement provisions do not disqualify such Award for
exemption under Rule 16b-3 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, or (ii)
such Award is not intended to qualify for exemption under such rule.


                                       9



<PAGE>
 
     (d)  No Right to Employment.  No person shall have any claim or right to be
granted an Award, and the grant of an Award shall not be construed as giving a
Participant the right to be retained in the employ of the Corporation.  Further,
the Corporation may at any time dismiss a Participant free from any liability,
or any claim under the Plan, except as provided herein or in any agreement
entered into with respect to an Award.

     (e)  No Rights as Stockholder.  Subject to the provisions of the applicable
Award, no Participant or Designated Beneficiary shall have any rights as a
stockholder with respect to any shares of Common Stock to be distributed under
the Plan until he or she has become the holder thereof.  Notwithstanding the
foregoing, in connection with each grant of Restricted Stock hereunder, the
applicable Award shall specify if and to what extent the Participant shall not
be entitled to the rights of a stockholder in respect of such Restricted Stock.

     (f)  Construction of the Plan.  The validity, construction, interpretation,
administration and effect of the Plan and of its rules and regulations, and
rights relating to the Plan, shall be determined solely in accordance with the
laws of the State of Delaware.

     (g)  Effective Date.  Subject to the approval of the stockholders of the
Company, the Plan shall be effective on the date of initial stockholder
approval.  No Awards may be granted under the Plan after the tenth anniversary
of the date of the initial stockholder approval.

     (h)  Amendment of Plan.  The Board of Directors may amend, suspend or
terminate the Plan or any portion thereof at any time, provided that no
amendment shall be made without stockholder approval if such approval is
necessary to comply with any tax or regulatory requirement with which or for
which the Board deems it necessary or desirable for the Plan to comply or
qualify, including for these purposes any approval requirement which is a
prerequisite for exemptive relief from Section 16(b) of the Securities Exchange
Act of 1934.  Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, the
Committee may amend the Plan in such manner as may be necessary so as to have
the Plan conform with local rules and regulations.

     (i)  Amendment of Award.  The Committee may amend, modify or terminate any
outstanding Award with the Participant's consent at any time prior to payment or
exercise in any manner not inconsistent with the terms of the Plan, including
(1) to change the date or dates as of which (A) an Option or Stock Appreciation
Right becomes exercisable, (B) a Performance Share is deemed earned or (C)


                                      10


<PAGE>
 
Restricted Stock or a Restricted Stock Unit becomes nonforfeitable or (2) to
cancel and reissue an Award under such different terms and conditions as it
determines, in its sole and complete discretion.

                       CALCULATION OF EARNINGS PER SHARE



NOTES

(A)  In connection with those securities outstanding prior to June 1, 1969 the
     Company elected under paragraph 46 of APB Opinion Number 15 to classify as
     common stock equivalents only those which were classified as residual
     securities under APB Opinion Number 9.


(B)  Earnings per share have been computed based on the weighted average number
     of common and common equivalent shares outstanding during the periods,
     after deducting from net income the dividend requirements on the
     outstanding $5.00 cumulative convertible stock. Common stock equivelents
     include series D participating convertible preferred stock and dilutive
     employee stock options, calculated using the treasury stock method.
