                                                      PART I

Item 1.     Business.

      Winthrop Growth Investors 1 Limited  Partnership (the  "Partnership")  was
organized  under the Uniform  Limited  Partnership  Act of the  Commonwealth  of
Massachusetts   on  June  20,  1983  for  the  purpose  of  owning  and  leasing
income-producing residential,  commercial and industrial properties. The General
Partners  of  the   Partnership   are  Two   Winthrop   Properties,   Inc.   and
Linnaeus-Lexington  Associates  Limited  Partnership.  Two Winthrop  Properties,
Inc.,  a  Massachusetts   corporation  (the  "Managing   General   Partner")  is
wholly-owned  by First  Winthrop  Corporation,  a Delaware  corporation  ("First
Winthrop"),  which is wholly-owned by Winthrop Financial  Associates,  A Limited
Partnership, a Maryland limited partnership ("WFA").

     Until  December  22,  1994,  Arthur J.  Halleran,  Jr. was the sole general
partner of Linnaeus  Associates  Limited  Partnership  ("Linnaeus") which is the
sole general  partner of WFA. On December 22,  1994,  pursuant to an  Investment
Agreement  entered into among Nomura Asset  Capital  Corporation  ("NACC"),  Mr.
Halleran and certain  other  individuals  who comprise the senior  management of
WFA,  the  general  partnership  interest in Linnaeus  was  transferred  to W.L.
Realty, L.P. ("W.L. Realty"). W.L. Realty is a Delaware limited partnership, the
general partner of which is A.I. Realty Company,  LLC  ("Realtyco").  The equity
securities of Realtyco are  currently  held by certain  employees of NACC.  Such
securities are subject to a call option agreement pursuant to which NACC may, at
any time, elect to purchase such securities for $1.00.

     Linnaeus-Lexington   Associates  Limited  Partnership  is  a  Massachusetts
limited partnership (the "Associate General Partner").  The general partners are
Arthur J.  Halleran,  Jr. and  Jonathan  W.  Wexler.  The other  partners of the
Associate  General  Partner are former  employees  and former  officers of First
Winthrop  Corporation  and WFA.  On January 27,  1995,  NACC  acquired  indirect
control of (but no economic interest in) the Associate General Partner.

     The Partnership was initially capitalized with contributions of $1,000 from
each of the General  Partners and $5,000 from the Initial  Limited  Partner.  On
June 24, 1983, the Partnership filed a Registration  Statement on Form S-11 (the
"Registration  Statement")  with the  Securities  and Exchange  Commission  (the
"Commission")   with  respect  to  the  public  offering  of  units  of  limited
partnership interest ("Units") in the Partnership.  The Registration  Statement,
covering the offering of 50,000 Units at a purchase price of $1,000 per Unit (an
aggregate of $50,000,000)  was declared  effective on May 11, 1984. The offering
terminated in February  1985, at which time Limited  Partners had subscribed for
23,144  Units,  representing  capital  contributions  from  Limited  Partners of
$23,144,000.  An  additional  five Units are held by WFC  Realty  Co.,  Inc.,  a
subsidiary of WFA ("WFC  Realty"),  such that there were 23,149 Units issued and
outstanding.  During 1994,  certain  Limited  Partners  elected to abandon their
interests  in the  Partnership,  reducing  the  number of  outstanding  Units to
23,139.

     The Partnership's only business is owning and leasing income producing real
estate.  The Partnership's  investment  objectives and policies are described at
pages 17-24 of its Prospectus  dated May 11, 1984 (the  "Prospectus")  under the
caption  "Investment  Objectives  and Policies,"  which  description is attached
hereto as an exhibit and incorporated  herein by this reference.  The Prospectus
was filed with the Commission pursuant to Rule 424(b) on July 3, 1984.

      The Partnership  invested  $18,176,787 of the original  offering  proceeds
(net of sales  commissions  and sales and  organizational  costs,  but including
acquisition  fees and expenses) in four  properties.  Two of the properties were
acquired in joint venture arrangements, one in a partnership arrangement and one
directly.  Subsequent to the acquisition,  the joint venture  arrangements  were
converted to limited partnerships.

      The  Partnership   allocated  $2,421,373  of  the  original  proceeds  for
operating  reserves (the  "Operating  Reserve").  To the extent not used,  these
funds  have  been   invested  in   interest-bearing   short-term   money  market
instruments.  From 1987 to 1990 the Partnership added funds otherwise  available
for  distribution  to these  reserves.  As discussed  later in this report under
Management's  Discussion  and  Analysis of  Financial  Condition  and Results of
Operations,  in 1994 the Partnership used $1.5 million of its reserves to reduce
the principal  balance of the mortgage loan  encumbering  Sunflower  Apartments.
Funds  are also held at each of the  properties  in which  the  Partnership  has
invested,  such that on December 31, 1994, $923,214 in cash and cash equivalents
were available to the Partnership.

(1)    Reflects total cost of property including capital improvements subsequent
       to acquisition but excluding acquisition fees and expenses. In connection
       with its ongoing evaluation, management of the Partnership wrote down the
       carrying  value  of  Sunflower   Apartments  by  $2,107,738  to  its  net
       realizable value  (approximately  $3.7 million) at December 31, 1993. The
       "Total Cost" does not reflect this writedown.
(2)    Reflects the  Partnership's  total investment in the property,  including
       amounts  invested to fund capital  improvements  and  operating  deficits
       subsequent to acquisition and acquisition fees and expenses.
(3)    The Partnership  invested in Sunflower Apartments through a joint venture
       arrangement  in which it owned a 99%  general  partnership  interest.  On
       October 7, 1988, the Partnership converted the joint venture to a limited
       partnership  with the  Partnership as the general  partner and its former
       co-venturer as the limited partner. On May 1, 1990, Winthrop  Management,
       an affiliate of WFA, was hired as property manager.
(4)    The  Partnership  originally  invested in Meadow Wood in a joint  venture
       arrangement  in  which  it  owned  a 95%  general  partnership  interest.
       Effective as of December 1, 1988,  the  Partnership  converted  the joint
       venture to a limited  partnership.  In 1990, the limited  partnership was
       restructured into a general  partnership.  On February 1, 1990,  Winthrop
       Management, an affiliate of WFA, was hired as property manager.
(5)    The  Partnership   invested  in  Stratford  Place  Apartments  through  a
       partnership  arrangement with WFA and WFC Realty. The Partnership holds a
       99.98%  interest in such  partnership  and WFA and WFC Realty each hold a
       .01% interest for which they each made pro rata capital contributions. On
       February 1, 1988, Winthrop Management,  an affiliate of WFA, was hired as
       property manager.
(6)    In  connection  with the mortgage  refinancing  on this property in 1989,

      Sunflower  Apartments.  Sunflower  Apartments are located in Dallas, Texas
approximately  eight  miles  northeast  of  the  central  business  district.  A
description  of the  general  character  of  this  property  and  the  terms  of
acquisition is contained in the  Supplement to the  Prospectus  dated August 24,
1984,  filed with the  Commission  pursuant to Rule 424(c) on September 7, 1984,
which  description is attached hereto as an exhibit and  incorporated  herein by
reference.

      Sunflower  is  encumbered  by a  first  mortgage  securing  a loan  with a
principal  balance,  as of December 31, 1994, of $1,043,092.  In April 1989, the
loan was modified pursuant to a modification  agreement that became effective as
of October 1, 1988.  From November 1, 1988 through October 1, 1991 (the "Reduced
Payment  Period"),  interest  only  payments  were  required on the  outstanding
principal  balance at 7% per annum. The note continued to accrue interest at the
rate of 9.5% per annum, and the resulting  "deferred  interest" was added to the
principal  balance.  From  November 1, 1990 through  December 1, 1993,  the loan
required  minimum  payments of $29,256,  which were first used to eliminate  the
deferred  interest  amounts.  In  addition,  the loan  required  that  available
operating  cash  flow,  as  defined in the  modification  agreement,  be used as
additional loan payments.  No cash flow payments were required during 1991, 1992
or 1993.

     The loan matured on January 1, 1994 at which point a balloon payment in the
approximate amount of $2,808,696 was due. In March 1994, the Partnership used $1
million of its reserves to make a principal  payment on the loan. As a result of
that payment,  the lender extended the maturity of the loan to June 30, 1994. In
June 1994, the Partnership made an additional  principal  payment of $500,000 to
further  extend the maturity date to August 31, 1994. On September 9, 1994,  the
Partnership  and the lender agreed to a modification  of the loan that calls for
fixed monthly payments of principal and interest in the amount of $47,893.  Such
payments will retire the remaining balance of the loan on December 1, 1996.

      In 1993,  in  connection  with its ongoing  evaluation,  management of the
Partnership  wrote down the carrying  value of the property by $2,107,738 to its
estimated net realizable value (approximately $3.7 million).

      During 1994, the Partnership  completed $62,464 of capital improvements at
the property,  consisting  primarily of apartment upgrades,  including replacing
appliances, carpeting and air conditioning units. These improvements were funded
primarily from the Partnership's reserves. Capital improvements planned for 1995
consist  of  additional  apartment  upgrades  as well as balcony  repairs,  some
exterior  painting and parking lot repairs.  These  improvements are expected to
cost  approximately  $131,000,  which amount will be funded from  operating cash
flow or, if needed, Partnership reserves.

      The Managing General Partner believes that the Dallas  residential  rental
market where Sunflower is located has been competitive but is stable.

      Meadow   Wood   Apartments.   Meadow  Wood   Apartments   are  located  in
Jacksonville,  Florida.  A description of the general character of this property
and the terms of  acquisition  is contained in the  Supplement to the Prospectus
dated  November 2, 1984,  filed with the  Commission  pursuant to Rule 424(c) on
November  6, 1984,  which  description  is  attached  hereto as an  exhibit  and
incorporated herein by this reference.

      Meadow  Wood is  encumbered  by a first  mortgage  securing  a loan with a
principal  balance,  as of December 31,  1994,  of  $4,233,492.  This loan bears
interest at an annual rate of 10% and matures on December 1, 2000.  Monthly debt
service payments are $36,966.

      In 1994,  the  Partnership  expended  $113,543  on  capital  improvements,
consisting primarily of replacing carpeting and appliances in apartment units as
well as upgrading the property's clubhouse.  These improvements were funded from
a  combination  of  Partnership  reserves  and cash flow.  Capital  improvements
costing  approximately  $190,000  are  planned  for 1994,  including  additional
upgrading of apartment unit interiors,  exterior painting, drainage improvements
and a new sprinkler  system.  These  improvements  will be funded from cash flow
and, if necessary, from Partnership reserves.

      The Jacksonville  rental market became extremely  competitive in 1991, and
was further impacted by the closing of the Jacksonville  Naval Shipyard in 1992.
The market stabilized  somewhat in 1993 but became  increasingly  competitive in
1994.
      Stratford  Place  Apartments.  Stratford  Place  Apartments are located in
Gaithersburg,  Maryland. A description of the general character of this property
and the terms of acquisition (including the terms of the partnership arrangement
with WFA and WFC Realty  through  which the  Partnership  invested in  Stratford
Place Apartments) is contained in the  Partnership's  Current Report on Form 8-K
filed with the  Commission  on March 17,  1986,  which  description  is attached
hereto as an exhibit and incorporated herein by this reference.



<PAGE>



      Stratford  Place is encumbered by a first mortgage  securing a loan with a
principal  balance,  as of December 31, 1994,  of  $10,092,324.  This loan bears
interest at an annual rate of 9.687% and matures on February 1, 1996.

      In 1994,  the  Partnership  spent $64,288 on capital  improvements,  which
included replacing a hot water tank,  exterior  painting,  replacing some common
area carpeting and upgrading unit interiors. These improvements were funded from
cash  flow  and  Partnership  reserves.   Anticipated  capital  improvements  of
approximately  $87,000 for 1995 include  replacing  additional  hot water tanks,
exterior  painting and upgrading unit interiors,  primarily carpet  replacement.
These  capital  improvements  will be funded  from  operating  cash flow and, if
necessary, Partnership reserves.

      In the opinion of the Managing General Partner, the Gaithersburg, Maryland
rental apartment market is currently stable.

      Stratford Village. Stratford Village Apartments are located in Montgomery,
Alabama.  A description of the general  character of this property and the terms
of  acquisition  is contained in the  Partnership's  Current  Report on Form 8-K
filed with the  Commission  on January 6, 1986,  which  description  is attached
hereto as an exhibit and incorporated herein by this reference.

      Stratford Village is encumbered by a first mortgage securing a loan with a
principal  balance,  as of December 31,  1994,  of  $5,342,906.  This loan bears
interest at an annual  rate of 7.72% and  matures on  November 1, 2024.  Monthly
debt service payments are $38,194.

      In 1994, the Partnership spent $63,466 on capital improvements,  primarily
on replacing windows, carpeting in apartment units and roofs. These improvements
were funded from cash flow. The Partnership has budgeted capital improvements of
approximately  $109,000  for  1995,  including  additional  window  replacement,
interior  carpet  replacement,  parking  lot  repairs,  landscaping  and  gutter
replacement.

      The Managing General Partner believes that the Montgomery,  Alabama rental
apartment market is currently strong.

      In the opinion of the Managing General Partner each of the four Properties
has adequate insurance coverage.


Employees

      The  Partnership  does not have any employees.  Services are performed for
the  Partnership  by its  General  Partners  and agents  retained by the General
Partners, including an affiliate of the General Partners, Winthrop Management.

Item 3.     Legal Proceedings.

      The Partnership is not a party, nor are any of its properties  subject, to
any material pending legal proceedings.

Item 4.     Submission of Matters to a Vote of Security Holders.    None.

Item 5. Market Price of and  Dividends  on the  Registrant's  Common  Equity and
        Related Stockholder Matters.

      The Registrant is a partnership and thus has no common stock.  There is no
active market for the Units.  Trading in the Units is sporadic and occurs solely
through private transactions.

      As of December 31, 1994, there were 1,403 holders of Units.

      The   Partnership   Agreement   requires  that  any  "Cash  Available  for
Distribution"  (defined  under the  Partnership  Agreement as Cash Flow less any
amounts set aside from Cash Flow for the restoration or creation of reserves) be
distributed  quarterly to the Partners in specified  proportions and priorities.
As a result of the Managing General  Partner's  initial  determination to retain
Cash Flow to fund  reserves,  there was no Cash Available for  Distribution  and
therefore no  distributions  paid to the Limited Partners between 1987 and 1990.
In 1991, the Managing  General  Partner  determined that the current year's Cash
Available  for  Distribution  together  with a portion of the cash  retained  as
reserves from prior years'  operations  were sufficient to permit a distribution
to the limited  partners of $962,535.  Of this amount,  $574,879 was funded from
reserves  established from prior years'  operations and $387,656 was funded from
1991  operations.  The 1991  distribution  was made as a result  of the  overall
improved  operations of the  Properties in 1990. An additional  distribution  of
$100,004  was  made  during  the  first  quarter  of 1992  attributable  to 1991
operations.  This  distribution  level was  maintained for each quarter in 1992.
During  1993,  the  quarterly  distribution  was reduced to $50,002  because the
Partnership  anticipated  needing  its  reserves to address the January 1, 1994,
maturity of the loan encumbering Sunflower Apartments.  In 1994, the Partnership
used $1.5  million  of its  reserves  to reduce  the  principal  balance  of the
Sunflower  loan. In addition,  the  modification  of the Sunflower loan requires
higher  monthly  debt  service  payments in order to fully  amortize the loan by
December  1,  1996.  As  a  result,   the   Partnership   maintained   quarterly
distributions  at $50,000 during 1994. The  Partnership  continues to review its
distribution policy on a quarterly basis.

Item 7.     Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and
            Results of Operations.

Liquidity and Capital Resources.

      As of  December  31,  1994,  the  Partnership's  balance  of cash and cash
equivalents  was  $923,214,  including  funds held at the various  properties in
which the Partnership has invested. The Partnership has invested, and expects to
continue to invest,  such amounts in short-term money market  instruments  until
required for Partnership purposes.

      The Partnership's interest income from its short-term investments and cash
flow derived from its  investments in real properties were sufficient in 1994 to
pay general and  administrative  expenses,  and are expected to be sufficient in
future years to pay these amounts. In 1994, the Partnership used $1.5 million of
its reserves to reduce the principal  balance of the loan encumbering  Sunflower
Apartments.

      Each of the properties in which the Partnership has invested requires cash
to make  principal and interest  payments on its mortgage  indebtedness,  to pay
operating expenses,  management fees, general and administrative expenses and to
complete capital  improvements.  Two of the four properties  (Stratford  Village
Apartments and Meadow Wood Apartments) were able to meet these  obligations from
their operating income in 1994.  Stratford Place Apartments operated at a slight
deficit, which was funded by the Partnership's reserves and the Partnership used
$1.5  million of its  reserves to reduce the  principal  balance of the mortgage
loan encumbering Sunflower Apartments.  Anticipated capital improvements in 1995
will be funded from a  combination  of the  Partnership's  reserves and property
cash flow. For a discussion of the proposed  capital  improvements and estimated
cost  for  each  property  see the  discussion  under  Item 1  above,  which  is
incorporated herein by reference.

      Based upon improved operating results in 1990 and the substantial reserves
funded from  operations  in 1987  through  1990,  the Managing  General  Partner
reassessed its decision not to make distributions in 1990 and made a substantial
distribution  in the first  quarter of 1991 ($30.24 per Unit,  or  approximately
$700,000  in the  aggregate).  Of the  amount  distributed,  $24.84 per Unit was
attributable  to  Cash  Flow  from  1990  operations  and  $5.40  per  Unit  was
attributable to Cash Flow from operations  during the first quarter of 1991. The
Managing General Partner made smaller distributions in the second quarter ($7.02
per Unit,  or  approximately  $162,510  in the  aggregate)  and in the third and
fourth quarters ($4.32 per Unit per quarter,  or  approximately  $100,000 in the
aggregate per quarter).  The fourth  quarter  distribution  was made in February
1992. The declining performance of the properties in 1991, primarily as a result
of market factors, led the Managing General Partner to reduce Cash Available for
Distribution  for the last two quarters of 1991.  The  distribution  was further
reduced for the last  quarter of 1992 and the 1993  quarterly  distributions  in
anticipation  of the maturity of the first mortgage loan  encumbering  Sunflower
Apartments.  The Partnership maintained its quarterly  distributions at the same
level during 1994 because it required a  significant  portion of its reserves to
reduce the principal balance of the Sunflower Apartments mortgage loan.


<PAGE>




      The loan encumbering  Sunflower  Apartments  matured on January 1, 1994 at
which point a balloon payment in the  approximate  amount of $2,808,696 was due.
In March  1994,  the  Partnership  used $1  million  of its  reserves  to make a
principal payment on the loan. As a result of that payment,  the lender extended
the maturity of the loan to June 30, 1994. In June 1994, the Partnership made an
additional  principal payment of $500,000 to further extend the maturity date to
August 31, 1994. On September 9, 1994, the  Partnership and the lender agreed to
a  modification  of the loan that calls for fixed monthly  payments of principal
and interest to increase from $29,256 to $47,893.  Such payments will retire the
remaining  balance of the loan on December 1, 1996. The Partnership  anticipates
having to use additional  reserves or the cash flow being generated by its other
properties to make the increased debt service payments on the Sunflower loan.

      Inflation and changing  economic  conditions could continue,  however,  to
affect vacancy levels, rental payment defaults and operating expenses, and thus,
would likely affect the  Partnership's  revenues and net income.  The ability of
these  properties  to improve  operations  will also affect the liquidity of the
Partnership.   The  Partnership's  liquidity  could  be  adversely  affected  by
unanticipated or greater than anticipated operating expenses.

Results of Operations

      1994  Compared to 1993:  The  Partnership's  total  revenue  decreased  by
approximately  1.0% in 1994 compared to 1993.  Rental  income  declined by 1.4%,
from  $6,206,712  in  1993 to  $6,118,605  in 1994 as  lower  rental  income  at
Stratford  Place and  Meadow  Wood  more than  offset  higher  rental  income at
Sunflower  and  Stratford  Village.   While  average  apartment  rents  for  the
Partnership's  properties  increased by  approximately  3.7%, from $492 to $510,
average  occupancy  declined  from 93% in 1993 to 91% in 1994.  Interest  income
declined  from $83,073 to $64,797  because the  Partnership  used a  significant
portion of its reserves to reduce the  principal  balance of the  mortgage  loan
encumbering Sunflower Apartments. Other income (including revenues from laundry,
vending,  late fees and lease termination fees) increased by approximately 20.1%
from  $219,853 in 1993 to $265,873 in 1994,  primarily  as a result of increased
lease termination fees at Stratford Place and Stratford Village.

      Expenses of operating the Partnership's  properties increased by less than
1%, from  $3,453,049  in 1993 to  $3,471,106  in 1994.  Increases in payroll and
insurance costs as well as higher real estate taxes were offset by lower utility
and  repair  and  maintenance  expenses.   Other  expenses  of  the  Partnership
(depreciation and amortization,  interest expense and provision for writedown of
real estate) decreased significantly from 1993 to 1994, predominantly because of
a $2,107,738 provision in 1993 for investment property writedown with respect to
Sunflower  Apartments.  Aside  from  this  writedown,  the  Partnership's  other
expenses decreased by approximately 3.1% from 1993 to 1994.  Interest expense on
the Partnership's  mortgages  decreased by approximately 5.5% from 1993 to 1994,
primarily as a result of lower interest expense on the Sunflower  mortgage loan,
while depreciation and amortization  expenses remained  essentially flat between
1993 and 1994.

      The Partnership's net loss declined from $2,922,167 in 1993 to $773,762 in
1994, primarily as a result of the 1993 investment property writedown.


<PAGE>




      The  Partnership's  expenditures for capital  improvements  increased from
$148,349 in 1993 to $303,761 in 1994.

      1993  Compared to 1992:  The  Partnership's  total  revenue  increased  by
approximately  4.4% in  1993  compared  to  1992.  Rental  income  increased  by
approximately 5.3%, from $5,896,067 in 1992 to $6,206,712 in 1993,  primarily as
a result of stronger  occupancy  at Meadow Wood and  Stratford  Place and higher
rental rates at Stratford Village. Average apartment rents for the Partnership's
properties  increased  by  approximately  2.9%,  from $478 to $492,  and average
occupancy  improved  from 91% in 1992 to 93% in 1993.  Interest and other income
(including revenues from laundry, vending, late fees and lease termination fees)
decreased by approximately 10.3% from $337,750 in 1992 to $302,926 in 1993.

      Expenses of operating the Partnership's  properties increased by less than
1%, from  $3,435,747 in 1992 to  $3,453,049  in 1993, as utility cost  increases
were  offset by a  reduction  in  general  and  administrative  expenses.  Other
expenses of the Partnership (including  depreciation and amortization,  interest
expense and partnership  administrative  expenses)  increased  significantly  in
1993,  predominantly  because of a $2,107,738  provision for investment property
writedown with respect to Sunflower Apartments.  Aside from this writedown,  the
Partnership's other expenses were essentially flat from 1992 to 1993.

      As a result of the investment  property  writedown,  the Partnership's net
loss increased from $1,078,745 in 1992 to $2,922,167 in 1993.

      The  Partnership's   expenditures  for  capital   improvements   decreased
dramatically from $451,876 in 1992 to $148,349 in 1993.

      The tax losses of the Partnership will gradually  decrease over time since
the advantages of accelerated  depreciation taken with respect to the properties
are greatest in the earliest years.  Also, the deductions for mortgage  interest
expense will steadily decrease as the mortgage principal is amortized.

      (a)   Security ownership of certain beneficial owners.

      No person or group is known by the Partnership to be the beneficial  owner
of more than 5% of the outstanding Units at December 31, 1994. Under the Amended
and Restated Agreement of Limited Partnership of the Partnership dated as of May
11,  1984 (the  "Partnership  Agreement"),  the  voting  rights  of the  Limited
Partners  are  limited  and,  in some  circumstances,  are  subject to the prior
receipt of certain opinions of counsel or judicial decisions.

      Under the Partnership  Agreement,  the right to manage the business of the
Partnership  is vested in the General  Partners and is generally to be exercised
only by the Managing  General  Partner,  although  the consent of the  Associate
General  Partners is required for all purchases,  financings,  refinancings  and
sales  or other  dispositions  of the  Partnership's  real  properties  and with
respect to certain  other  matters.  See Item 1 above for a  description  of the
General Partners.

      (b)   Security ownership of management.

      As of December 31, 1994,  an  affiliate  of the General  Partner  owned 10
Units in the  Partnership.  No officers,  directors  or general  partners of the
General Partners own any Units.


      (c)   Changes in control.

      There exists no  arrangement  known to the  Partnership  the  operation of
which may at a subsequent date result in a change in control of the Partnership.

Item 13.    Certain Relationships and Related Transactions.

      See Note 4 of Notes to Consolidated  Financial  Statements for information
about  transactions  between the Partnership and the General  Partners and their
affiliates.  See Item 11 above for information  concerning the fees, commissions
and cash distributions  which the Partnership paid to or accrued for the account
of the General  Partners and their  affiliates  for the year ended  December 31,

                    REPORT OF INDEPENDENT PUBLIC ACCOUNTANTS



              To WINTHROP GROWTH INVESTORS I LIMITED PARTNERSHIP:

     We have audited the  accompanying  consolidated  balance sheets of WINTHROP
GROWTH INVESTORS I LIMITED PARTNERSHIP (a Massachusetts  limited partnership) as
of  December  31,  1994 and 1993,  and the related  consolidated  statements  of
operations,  changes in  partners'  capital and cash flows for each of the three
years in the period ended December 31, 1994. These financial  statements are the
responsibility of the Partnership's  General Partners.  Our responsibility is to
express an opinion on these financial statements based on our audits. We did not
audit  the  financial  statements  of two of the  Properties,  which  statements
reflect  approximately 49% and 49% of total  consolidated  assets as of December
31, 1994 and 1993, respectively and 47%, 47% and 35% of consolidated revenues in
1994,  1993 and 1992,  respectively.  Those  statements  were  audited  by other
auditors whose reports have been furnished to us and our opinion,  insofar as it
relates to the  amounts  included  for those  entities,  is based  solely on the
reports of the other auditors.

     We conducted  our audits in accordance  with  generally  accepted  auditing
standards.  Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material
misstatement.  An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting
the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements.  An audit also includes
assessing the  accounting  principles  used and  significant  estimates  made by
management,  as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation.
We  believe  that our  audits  and the  reports  of  other  auditors  provide  a
reasonable basis for our opinion.

     In our opinion,  based on our audits and the reports of other auditors, the
financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects,
the financial position of Winthrop Growth Investors I Limited  Partnership as of
December 31, 1994 and 1993, and the results of its operations and its cash flows
for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 1994, in conformity
with generally accepted accounting principles.

     Our  audits  were made for the  purpose  of forming an opinion on the basic
financial  statements taken as a whole.  Schedule III listed in Item 14(a)(2) is
the responsibility of Winthrop Growth Investors I Limited Partnership Management
and is  presented  for purposes of complying  with the  Securities  and Exchange
Commission's rules and is not a required part of the basic financial statements.
This schedule has been subjected to the auditing procedures applied in our audit
of the basic  financial  statements and, in our opinion,  fairly states,  in all
material  respects,  the  financial  data  required  to be set forth  therein in
relation to the basic financial statements taken as a whole.

                         NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
                           DECEMBER 31, 1994 AND 1993

1.     ORGANIZATION

Winthrop  Growth  Investors  I  Limited   Partnership  (the  "Partnership")  was
organized  on June 20, 1983 under the  Uniform  Limited  Partnership  Act of the
Commonwealth of Massachusetts  for the purpose of investing in  income-producing
residential,  commercial and industrial  real  properties.  The  Partnership has
acquired  two  properties  through  joint  venture  agreements,  one  through  a
partnership  agreement and one through a fee simple interest (the "Properties"),
all of which are residential apartment complexes. The Partnership shall continue
in full  force and  effect  until  December  31,  2003 or until  dissolution  in
accordance with the terms of the Partnership Agreement.


2.     SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

Basis of Accounting - The  accompanying  consolidated  financial  statements are
prepared  on the  accrual  basis of  accounting  in  accordance  with  generally
accepted  accounting   principles.   Revenues  consist  of  rents,  interest  on
investments,  and laundry/vending income. Rental revenue is recognized under the
gross rent potential  method by crediting  gross rent potential at the beginning
of each month and reducing gross  potential by vacancies and  concessions at the
end of each month.

Basis  of  Consolidation  -  The  accompanying   financial   statements  of  the
Partnership have been consolidated with those of the Properties. All significant
intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation.

The  Partnership  acquired  a  99%,  99.99%,   99.98%  and  100%  interest  (the
"Controlling  Interest") in four real  properties,  DEK Associates,  Meadow Wood
Associates,  Stratford Place Investors Limited Partnership and Stratford Village
Realty Trust, respectively. The Partnership's original investment in Meadow Wood
Associates was through a joint venture agreement in which it owned a 95% general
partnership interest.  Effective December 1, 1988, the Partnership converted the
joint venture into a limited  partnership  in which the  Partnership is the sole
general   partner.   Subsequently,   on  November  15,  1990,  the   Partnership
restructured  Meadow Wood  Associates  into a general  partnership  in which the
Partnership now owns a 99.99% general partnership interest. Effective October 7,
1988, the Partnership  also converted the joint venture of DEK Associates into a
limited  partnership.  The  Partnership  has become the sole general partner for
both partnerships and continues to receive the same allocation of income, losses
and cash  distributions as prior to the conversion.  Due to cumulative  minority
interest losses exceeding the minority interest capital, the Partnership records
100% of the losses of all the Properties.

Income  Taxes - No provision  has been made for  federal,  state or local income
taxes in the accompanying  consolidated financial statements of the Partnership.
The  Partners  are  required to report on their  individual  tax  returns  their
allocable  share  of  income,  gains,  losses,  deductions  and  credits  of the
Partnership.  The  Partnership  files its tax returns on the accrual  basis.  On
October  19,  1983,  the  Internal  Revenue  Service  issued a  ruling  that the
Partnership will be classified as a partnership for federal income tax purposes.

Distributions  to Partners - The Managing  General  Partner has determined  that
current year cash available for distribution and cash retained from prior years'
operations were sufficient to support a distribution to the limited  partners of
$199,943 in 1994, $200,007 in 1993 and $400,015 in 1992.

Depreciation  -  For  financial  statement  purposes,  each  of  the  Properties
depreciates  the  cost of its  real  property  over 25  years  and its  personal
property over 10 years using the straight-line method.

For tax purposes,  depreciation is computed using the accelerated  cost recovery
system  (ACRS) over 18 or 19 years for real  property  and 5 years for  personal
property.

Deferred  Costs  and  Amortization  -  Costs  relating  to the  acquisition  and
selection of the  Partnership's  investment in the  Properties  are deferred and
amortized over 25 years.  Costs in excess of the Partnership's  initial basis in
the net assets of the Properties  are amortized over the estimated  useful lives
of the underlying assets.

Two Winthrop  Properties,  Inc. ("Two Winthrop"),  the Managing General Partner,
Winthrop  Securities Co., Inc. ("Winthrop  Securities"),  the Selling Agent, and
Winthrop  Management,  the manager of all of the  Properties,  are wholly  owned
subsidiaries  of First Winthrop  Corporation  which, in turn, is wholly owned by
Winthrop Financial Associates, a Limited Partnership ("WFA"). Linnaeus-Lexington
Associates   Limited   Partnership,   the  Associate   General  Partner  of  the
Partnership,  is a  limited  partnership,  some of whose  general  partners  are
partners  of WFA.  WFA and its  affiliates  manage or  advise a large  number of
partnerships  organized to own or operate apartment complexes,  as well as other
real estate investments,  or to invest in other limited partnerships that own or
operate apartment complexes or other real estate investments. WFA has formed and
is planning to form, directly or through affiliates,  additional partnerships or
other  entities,  both  public  and  private,  some of  which  may have the same
investment objectives as those of the Partnership.

Winthrop Management is the management agent for all four properties. Pursuant to
each  management  agreement the  partnerships  and trust pay a 5% management fee
based on gross rental  collections.  The total management fee for the properties
for the years ended December 31, 1994, 1993 and 1992 was $316,494,  $315,588 and
$300,832, respectively.

and for each quarter thereafter,  the General Partners generally are entitled to
percentages  of Cash  Available  for  Distribution  subordinated  to a specified
minimum  return  to the  Limited  Partners,  as  described  in  the  Partnership
Agreement.

During the liquidation stage of the Partnership,  the General Partners and their

The  Partnership's  tax loss for 1994 differs from that for financial  reporting
purposes  primarily due to the  accounting  differences  in the  recognition  of
depreciation and the amortization of deferred costs. A reconciliation of the tax
loss for 1994 is as follows:
