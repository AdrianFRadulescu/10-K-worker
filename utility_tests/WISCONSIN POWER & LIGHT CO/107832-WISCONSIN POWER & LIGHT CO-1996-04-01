   ITEM 1.  BUSINESS

                                   THE COMPANY

            On March 1, 1988, after obtaining shareowner and all the
   necessary regulatory approvals, Wisconsin Power and Light Company (the
   "Company" or "WP&L") effected a corporate restructuring which included the
   formation of a holding company, WPL Holdings, Inc ("WPLH").  WPL Holdings,
   Inc. is the parent company of WP&L and its utility subsidiaries and of
   Heartland Development Corporation, the parent corporation for nonregulated
   businesses.

            WP&L, incorporated in Wisconsin on February 21, 1917, as the
   Eastern Wisconsin Electric Company, is a public utility predominately
   engaged in the transmission and distribution of electric energy and the
   generation and bulk purchase of electric energy for sale.  It also
   transports, distributes and sells natural gas purchased from gas
   suppliers.  Nearly all of WP&L's customers are located in south and
   central Wisconsin.  WP&L operates in municipalities pursuant to permits of
   indefinite duration which are regulated by Wisconsin law.  WP&L does not
   derive a material portion of its revenues from any one customer.

            WP&L owns all of the outstanding capital stock of South Beloit
   Water, Gas and Electric Company ("South Beloit"), a public utility
   supplying electric, gas and water service, principally in Winnebago
   County, Illinois, which was incorporated on July 23, 1908.

            WP&L also owns varying interests in several other subsidiaries
   and investments which are not material to WP&L's operations.

            On November 10, 1995, WPLH entered an agreement to merge with 
   IES Industries  Inc. ("IES")  of Cedar Rapids, Iowa, and Interstate Power
   Company ("IPC") of Dubuque, Iowa, under a holding company that will be
   known as Interstate Energy Corporation, headquartered in Madison,
   Wisconsin.  The merger is subject to the approval of the common
   shareowners of all companies and various regulatory agencies.  Interstate
   Energy Corporation will be registered under the Public Utility Holding
   Company Act of 1935, as amended.  It is anticipated that WP&L will
   continue to operate as a separate entity, headquartered in Madison, WI,
   for a period of time following the merger.  See Item 5. " Market for
   Registrant's Common Equity and Related Stockholder Matters - Proposed
   Merger" for additional information.

   Regulation

            WP&L is subject to regulation by the Public Service Commission
   of Wisconsin ("PSCW") as to retail utility rates and service, accounts,
   issuance and use of proceeds of securities, certain additions and
   extensions to facilities, and in other respects.  The PSCW is comprised of
   three Commissioners appointed by the Governor and ratified by the State
   Senate.  WP&L is required to file a rate case with the PSCW every two
   years with requests for rate relief  based on a forward- looking  test
   year period.  South Beloit is subject to regulation by the Illinois
   Commerce Commission ("ICC") for retail utility rates and service,
   accounts, issuance and use of proceeds of securities, certain additions
   and extensions to facilities, and in other respects.    

            The PSCW's inquiries into the future structure of the natural
   gas and electric utility industries are ongoing.  The stated goal of the
   PSCW in the natural gas docket is to move all gas supply activities out of
   the existing regulated distribution utilities and allow  independent units
   to compete for the business.  The goal of the electric utility
   restructuring process is to create open access transmission and
   distribution services for all customers with  competitive generation and
   customer  service markets.  Additional proceedings as well as consultation
   with the legislature are planned prior to a target implementation date
   after the year 2000.  

            The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission ("FERC") has
   jurisdiction under the Federal Power Act over certain of the electric
   utility facilities and operations, wholesale rates and accounting
   practices of WP&L and in certain other respects.  Certain of WP&L's
   natural gas facilities and operations are subject to the jurisdiction of
   the FERC under the Natural Gas Act.  WP&L is presently exempt from all
   provisions of the Public Utility Holding Company Act of 1935, except
   provisions relating to the acquisition of securities of other public
   utility companies.

            The FERC is currently developing regulation which will begin to
   provide open access to electric utility transmission facilities for
   wholesale customers subject to certain approved FERC tariffs.  WP&L
   believes its existing open access tariffs position it well to compete
   under such market conditions.

            With respect to environmental matters impacting WP&L and its
   subsidiaries, the United States Environmental Protection Agency
   administers certain federal statutes and has delegated the administration
   of other environmental initiatives to the Wisconsin Department of Natural
   Resources ("DNR").  In addition, the DNR has jurisdiction over air and
   water quality standards associated with fossil fuel fired electric
   generation and the level and flow of water, safety and other matters
   pertaining to hydroelectric generation.

            WP&L is subject to the jurisdiction of the Nuclear Regulatory
   Commission ("NRC") with respect to the Kewaunee Nuclear Power Plant
   ("Kewaunee") and to the jurisdiction of the United States Department of
   Energy ("DOE") with respect to the disposal of nuclear fuel and other
   radioactive wastes from  Kewaunee.

   Employees

            At  year-end 1995, WP&L employed 2,332 persons, of whom 1,872
   were considered electric utility employees, 319 were considered gas
   utility employees and 141 were considered other utility employees.  WP&L
   has a three-year contract with members of the International Brotherhood of
   Electrical Workers, Local 965, that is in effect until June 1, 1996.  The
   contract covers 1,601 of WP&L's employees.  The Company entered
   discussions concerning renegotiation of this contract in February 1996. 
   No assurance can be given regarding the outcome of these negotiations.

   ELECTRIC OPERATIONS:

   General

            WP&L provides electricity in a service territory of
   approximately 16,000 square miles in 35 counties in southern and central
   Wisconsin and four counties in northern Illinois.  As of December 31,
   1995, WP&L provided retail electric service to approximately 377,000
   customers in 610 cities, villages and towns, and wholesale service to 25
   municipal utilities, one privately owned utility, three rural electric
   cooperatives, one American Indian nation  and to the Wisconsin Public
   Power, Inc. system for the provision of  retail service to nine
   communities.

            Electric operations represented 79.2 percent of WP&L's total
   operating revenues and 87.8 percent of WP&L's total operating income for
   the year ended December 31, 1995.

            Electric sales are seasonal to some extent with the yearly peak
   normally occurring in the summer months.  WP&L also experiences a smaller
   winter peak in December or January.  The maximum net hourly peak load on
   the electric system was 2,197 megawatts  and occurred on July 31, 1995.  A
   new winter system peak of 1,913 megawatts occurred on December 11, 1995. 
   During the year ended December 31, 1995, about 82.1 percent of total
   kilowatthour requirements were generated by company-owned and
   jointly-owned facilities and the remaining 17.9 percent were purchased.

            WP&L's electric generating facilities include:  four coal-fired
   generating stations (including nine units; four jointly owned), seven
   natural-gas-fired peaking units, eight hydro-electric plants (two jointly
   owned), one gas-fired steam generating plant and one nuclear power plant
   (jointly owned).  WP&L will have the ability to dispatch and include in
   its reserve margin an 86 MW gas-fired peaking unit which will be
   operational in 1996.  Refer to Item 2. "Properties" for additional
   information regarding electric generating facilities.  WP&L owns
   21,413 miles of electric transmission and distribution lines and 362
   substations located adjacent to the communities served.   WP&L is
   interconnected with other utilities in Wisconsin and neighboring states
   and is an associate member of the Mid-Continent Power Pool ("MAPP") and a
   member of the Mid-America Interconnected Network, Inc.  ("MAIN").  WP&L
   officially notified the MAIN board of directors of  its intentions to
   withdraw  from MAIN, effective December 31, 1997.   WP&L believes that its
   customers' financial interest will be better served by participation in a
   regional organization that can reach consensus on transmission
   restructuring issues.  To date, MAIN has been unable to accomplish that
   objective.   Although WP&L would have until December 31, 1997, to join
   another reliability region, WP&L is currently studying its options and
   expects to make a final decision in 1996.

            The Company projects electric sales to grow at a  rate of 2.4
   percent  annually  over the next five years.   For a discussion regarding
   the Company's future construction, capital requirements and financing, see
   the "Liquidity and Capital Resources" section of Item 7. "Management's
   Discussion and Analysis of  Financial Condition and the Results of
   Operations."

   Fuel

            In 1995, approximately 81.1 percent of WP&L's net kilowatthour
   generation of electricity was fueled by coal and 15.3 percent by nuclear
   fuel (provided by WP&L's 41 percent ownership interest in Kewaunee.)  The
   remaining electricity generated was produced by hydroelectric, oil-fired
   and natural gas generation.

   Coal

            The Company's primary fuel source is coal.  To ensure an
   adequate supply of coal, WP&L has entered into certain long-term coal
   contracts.  These contracts include a demand or take-or-pay clause under
   which payments are required if contracted quantities are not purchased. 
   Purchase obligations on these coal and related rail contracts total
   approximately $168  million through December 31, 2002.  WP&L's management
   believes it will meet minimum coal and rail purchase obligations under the
   contracts.  Minimum purchase obligations on these contracts over the next
   five years are estimated to be $37 million in 1996, 1997, 1998, $30
   million in 1999 and $10 million in 2000.  WP&L anticipates that its
   average fuel costs will likely increase in the future, due to cost
   escalation provisions in existing coal and transportation contracts. 
   WP&L's management believes that any increases in costs associated with
   these contracts will be incorporated in future rates and as such will not
   have a material effect on operating results.

            The estimated coal requirements of WP&L's generating units
   (including jointly-owned facilities) for the years 1996 through 2015 total
   about 168 million tons.  Present coal supply contracts and transportation
   contracts (excluding extension options) cover approximately 16 percent and
   19 percent, respectively, of this estimated requirement.  WP&L will seek
   renewals of existing contracts or additional sources of supply and
   negotiate new or additional transportation contracts to satisfy these
   requirements and to comply with environmental regulations.

   Purchased Power

            During the year ended December 31, 1995, about 17.9 percent of
   WP&L's total kilowatthour requirements were met through purchased power. 

   Nuclear

            Kewaunee is jointly-owned by WP&L (41 percent), Wisconsin Public
   Service Corporation (41.2 percent) and Madison Gas & Electric Company
   (17.8 percent).  Wisconsin Public Service Corporation ("WPSC") is the
   operator.  The plant began commercial operation in 1974.

            WPSC is a member of the Institute of Nuclear Power ("INPO"). 
   All nuclear generating units in the U.S. belong to INPO and have made a
   commitment to the standards of excellence promoted by this organization. 
   INPO was created by the nuclear utilities in the U.S. after the Three Mile
   Island accident.  INPO has negotiated with insurance carriers for lower
   premiums for those utilities that meet the highest standards of excellence
   and have attained a Category 1 rating.  Kewaunee has attained this
   Category 1 rating 5 times out of 6 ranking periods and has benefited with
   reduced insurance premiums.  The National Nuclear Accrediting Board
   ("NNAB") is a part of the INPO structure.  The purpose of NNAB is to
   monitor and accredit each utility's training program as established by
   INPO standards.  All ten accredited training programs at Kewaunee are
   currently in good standing.

            The supply of nuclear fuel for the Kewaunee plant involves the
   mining and milling of uranium ore to uranium concentrates, the conversion
   of uranium concentrates to uranium hexafluoride, the enrichment of the
   uranium hexafluoride and the fabrication of the enriched uranium into
   usable fuel assemblies.  After a region (approximately one-third of the
   nuclear fuel assemblies in the reactor) of spent fuel is removed from the
   reactor, it is placed in temporary storage for cooling in a spent fuel
   pool at the plant site.  Permanent storage is addressed below.  Presently,
   there are no operating facilities in the United States reprocessing
   commercial nuclear fuel.  A discussion of the nuclear fuel supply for
   Kewaunee, which requires approximately 300,000 pounds of uranium
   concentrates per year follows:

             (a)  Requirements for uranium are met through spot market or
                  contract purchases of uranium.  In general, a three-year
                  supply of uranium is maintained.

             (b)  Uranium hexafluoride, from inventory and from spot market
                  purchases, was used to satisfy converted material
                  requirements in 1995.  Conversion services relating to
                  uranium hexafluoride are purchased on the spot market, as
                  the available supply in this market provides for
                  attractive pricing.

             (c)  In 1995, enrichment services were not required.  Future
                  services will be procured from COGEMA, Inc. pursuant to a
                  contract last amended in October 1995.  Enrichment
                  services are also purchased from the United States
                  Enrichment Corporation  under the terms of the utility
                  services contract.  This contract is in effect for the
                  life of Kewaunee.  The Kewaunee owners over the next ten
                  years are committed to take 70 percent of their annual
                  enrichment services requirements in alternate years 1997,
                  1999, 2001, 2003, and 2005 from the United States
                  Enrichment Corporation.

             (d)  Fuel fabrication requirements through 2001 are covered by
                  contract with Siemens Power Corporation.

             (e)  Beyond the stated periods for Kewaunee, additional
                  contracts for uranium concentrates, conversion to uranium
                  hexafluoride, fabrication and spent fuel storage will have
                  to be procured.  The prices for the foregoing are
                  currently expected to increase slightly.

            The National Energy Policy Act of 1992 provides that both the
   Federal government and the nuclear utilities fund the decontamination and
   decommissioning of the three federal gaseous diffusion plants in the
   United States.  This will require the owners of Kewaunee to pay an
   additional  $15.7 million in current dollars over the next 12 years plus
   an adjustment for inflation.  WP&L's share including interest amounted to
   an annual payment of approximately $537,000 in 1995.

            The steam generator tubes at Kewaunee are susceptible to
   corrosion characteristics seen throughout the nuclear industry.  During
   the first quarter of 1995, Kewaunee was shutdown for scheduled maintenance
   and refueling.  Inspection of the steam generators revealed increased
   levels of tube degeneration.  Prior to shutdown the equivalent of
   approximately 12 percent of the tubes in the steam generators were
   plugged, with no loss of capacity.  When the plant was returned to
   service in May 1995, approximately 21 percent of the tubes were plugged
   resulting in an initial capacity reduction of approximately 4 percent. 
   Approximately half of this lost capacity has been recovered through
   operating modifications.  The ultimate small reduction in capacity did
   not affect revenues or earnings in 1995 because of operating and
   maintenance cost savings and reserve capacity recovery efforts at
   Kewaunee.  In addition, there was no impact on the Company's bulk power
   sales due to the availability of attractive purchased power opportunities.

            As a result of the need to address the repair or replacement of
   the steam generators, the owners of Kewaunee have been, and are continuing
   to, evaluate various alternatives to deal with capacity degradation of the
   steam generator tubes.  As part of this evaluation the owners have:

            (a)   submitted a request to the NRC to redefine the pressure
                  boundary point of the repaired steam generator tubes
                  (sleeved tubes) which have been removed from service by
                  plugging, in order to allow the return of many of the
                  sleeved tubes to service.  If the request is granted, even
                  if additional degraded tubes would be discovered during
                  the next planned shutdown in the fall of 1996, the
                  requested redefinition of the pressure boundary point
                  should allow the plant to return to full output.  Testing
                  of three tubes removed during the 1995 refueling outage
                  indicates structural soundness equal to the original tube
                  strength.  Management believes the request will be granted
                  by the NRC;

            (b)   requested approval from the NRC to pursue welded repair
                  technologies to return plugged tubes to service.  Although
                  welded tube repair technologies exist, the technology is
                  not presently approved by the NRC; and

            (c)   continued to evaluate the economics of replacement of the
                  steam generators.  The replacement of steam generators is
                  estimated to cost approximately $100 million, exclusive of
                  additional purchased power costs associated with an
                  extended shutdown.

            In the event none of the above alternatives is pursued (for
   failure to obtain NRC approval or otherwise), the owners would continue to
   evaluate the potential financial and regulatory implications of a change
   in ownership (which would likely require, as a condition precedent,
   authority to replace the steamm generator) or early shutdown of Kewaunee.  
   WP&L believes that the best near term economic alternative for the owners
   of Kewaunee is to continue to pursue tube recovery and repair processes. 
   WP&L will reassess its views of available alternatives based on the
   condition of steam generator tubes during the fall 1996 refueling outage.  
   If early shutdown is pursued, WP&L anticipates that it would receive full
   recovery in rates of its undepreciated plant balance and decommissioning
   expense.  On December 31, 1995, the net book value of WP&L's share of
   Kewaunee was $57.0 million.  

            Physical decommissioning is expected to occur during the period
   2014 to 2021 with additional expenditures being incurred during the period
   2022 to 2050 related to the storage of spent nuclear fuel at the site. 
   The undiscounted amount of decommissioning costs estimated to be expended
   between the years 2014 and 2050 is $1,016 million.  Wisconsin utilities
   operating nuclear generating plants are required by the PSCW to establish
   external trust funds to provide for the decommissioning of such plants.
   WP&L's share of the decommissioning costs is estimated to be $169 million
   (in 1995 dollars, assuming the plant is operating through 2013) based on a
   1992 site-specific study, using the immediate dismantlement method of
   decommissioning.   WP&L's annual contribution to the external trust fund
   for decommissioning  was $10.7 million in 1995 and is expected to be $10.7
   million in 1996.  The market value of the investments in the funds
   established by WP&L at December 31, 1995 totaled $73.4 million. 
   Additionally, in July 1994, the PSCW issued a  generic order covering
   utilities that have nuclear generation.  This order standardizes the
   escalation assumption to be used in determining nuclear decommissioning
   liabilities.  After-tax earnings on the tax-qualified and nontax-qualified
   decommissioning funds are assumed to be 6.1 percent and 5.1 percent,
   respectively.  The future escalation rate is assumed to be 6.5 percent.

            Pursuant to the Nuclear Waste Policy Act of 1982, the DOE has
   entered into a contract with WP&L to accept, transport and dispose of
   spent nuclear fuel beginning no later than January 31, 1998.  It is likely
   that the DOE will delay the acceptance of spent nuclear fuel beyond 1998. 
   A fee to offset the costs of the DOE's disposal for all spent fuel used
   since April 7, 1983 has been assessed by the DOE at one mill per net
   kilowatthour of electricity generated and sold by  Kewaunee.  An
   additional one-time fee was paid for the disposal of spent nuclear fuel
   used to generate electricity prior to April 7, 1983.

            Spent fuel is currently stored at Kewaunee.  The existing
   capacity of the spent fuel storage facility will enable storage of the
   projected quantities of spent fuel through April 2001.  Kewaunee is
   currently evaluating options for the storage of additional quantities
   beyond 2001.  Several technologies are available.  An investment of
   approximately $2.5 million  could provide additional storage sufficient to
   meet on-site spent fuel storage needs until 2013, the expiration of the
   current operating license.

            The Low-Level Radioactive Waste Policy Act of 1980, as amended,
   provides that states may enter into compacts to provide for regional
   low-level waste disposal facilities.  Wisconsin is a member of the Midwest
   Interstate Low-Level Radioactive Waste Compact.  Ohio has been selected as
   the host state for the Midwest Compact and is proceeding with the
   preliminary phases of site selection.  In July 1995, the Branwell, South
   Carolina disposal facility again began accepting waste materials from
   outside its region.  The Kewaunee owners expect to have sufficient storage
   space either on site or through shipments to Branwell to satisfy low 
   level radioactive waste disposal needs until the Ohio facility accepts low
   level radioactive waste materials.

   Recovery of Electric Fuel Costs

            In WP&L's most recent rate case, the PSCW approved elimination
   of the retail electric fuel adjustment clause for a two year trial period,
   1995-1996.  For this period, retail rates will remain unchanged even if
   fuel costs vary from forecasted levels established in the rate proceeding.

            WP&L's wholesale rates and South Beloit's retail rates contain
   fuel adjustment clauses pursuant to which rates are adjusted monthly to
   reflect changes in the costs of fuel.

   Environmental Matters

            WP&L cannot precisely forecast the effect of future
   environmental regulations by federal, state and local authorities upon its
   generating, transmission and other facilities, or its operations, but has
   taken steps to anticipate the future while meeting the requirements of
   current environmental regulations.  The Clean Air Act Amendments of 1977
   and subsequent amendments to the Clean Air Act, as well as the new laws
   affecting the handling and disposal of solid and hazardous wastes, could
   affect the siting, construction and operating costs of both present and
   future generating units.

            Under the Federal Clean Water Act, National Pollutant Discharge
   Elimination System permits for generating station discharge into water
   ways are required to be obtained from the DNR to which the permit program
   has been delegated.  These permits must be periodically renewed.  WP&L has
   obtained such permits for all of its generating stations or has filed
   timely applications for renewals of such permits.

            Air quality regulations promulgated by the DNR in accordance
   with federal standards impose statewide restrictions on the emission of
   particulates, sulfur dioxide, nitrogen oxides and other air pollutants and
   require permits from the DNR for the operation of emission sources.  WP&L
   currently has the necessary permits to operate its fossil-fueled
   generating facilities.  While periodic exceedances in air emissions may
   occur, management promptly responds to these events and works with the DNR
   to resolve any permit compliance issues.   With the passage of the new
   Federal Clean Air Act Amendments, the state is required to include these
   provisions into their permit requirements.  WP&L has submitted timely
   Title V permit applications in compliance with schedules set forth by the
   regulators.  WP&L has also completed application for Phase II permits
   under the Clean Air Act in compliance with the time lines identified.  The
   state Title V operating permits, when issued, will consolidate all
   existing air permit conditions and regulatory requirements into one permit
   for each facility.  Permits are expected to be issued in  1996.  Until
   such time, the facilities will continue to operate under their existing
   permit conditions. 

            Pursuant to Section 144.386(2) of the Wisconsin Statutes, WP&L
   has submitted data and plans for 1996 sulfur dioxide emissions compliance. 
   Actual 1995 emissions were reported to the DNR.  WP&L is currently in
   compliance with the state requirement.  WP&L will continue to make any
   necessary operational changes in fuel types and power plant dispatch to
   comply with the system emissions limit of 1.2 pounds SO2 per million BTU.

            WP&L's compliance strategy for Wisconsin's sulfur dioxide law
   (discussed above) and the Federal Clean Air Act Amendments required plant
   upgrades at its generating facilities.  The majority of these projects
   were completed in 1993.  WP&L has installed continuous emission monitoring
   systems at all of its coal-fired boilers in compliance with federal
   requirements.  Monitoring for sulfur dioxide was also required by Title IV
   of the Federal Clean Air Act at WP&L's South Fond du Lac combustion
   turbine site.  These requirements were also met.  Additional monitoring
   systems for nitrogen oxides are required in 1996 at the combustion turbine
   site.  WP&L has installed these monitors, and will complete certification
   tests for the equipment by May 1996.  No significant investments are
   anticipated at this time to meet the requirements of the Federal Clean Air
   Act Amendments.

            Pursuant to Section 311(j)(5) of the Clean Water Act, WP&L has
   submitted a facility response plan for the South Fond du Lac combustion
   turbine site.  The plans addresses pollution prevention and spill response
   activities for those facilities with capacity to store in excess of one
   million gallons of oil.

            WP&L maintains licenses for all of its ash disposal facilities
   and regularly reports to the DNR groundwater data and quantities of ash
   landfilled or reused.  The landfills are operated according to a Plan of 
   Operation approved by the DNR.  WP&L monitors hazardous materials use and
   hazardous waste generation at its facilities.  Annual reports are filed
   with the DNR on quantities stored and generated as required by the
   Superfund Amendments and Reauthorizaton Act and the Resource Conservation
   Recovery Act.

            WP&L's accumulated pollution abatement expenditures adjusted for
   accumulated retirements totaled $132.7 million as of December 31, 1995. 
   The major expenditures consist of about $60 million for the installation
   of electrostatic precipitators for the purpose of reducing particulate
   emissions from WP&L's coal-fired generating stations and approximately $73
   million for other pollution abatement equipment at the Columbia, Edge-
   water, Kewaunee, Nelson Dewey, Rock River and Blackhawk plants. 
   Expenditures during 1995 totalled approximately $.5 million.  Estimated
   future pollution abatement expenditures total $3.7 million through 1997. 
   WP&L's estimated pollution abatement expenditures are subject to
   continuing review and are revised from time to time due to escalation of
   construction costs, changes in construction plans and changes in
   environmental regulations.

            See "Electric Operations - Nuclear" for information concerning
   the disposal of spent nuclear fuel and high level nuclear waste.

   GAS OPERATIONS:

   General

             As of December 31, 1995, WP&L provided retail natural gas
   service to approximately 146,000 customers in 242 cities, villages and
   towns in 22 counties in southern and central Wisconsin and one county in
   northern Illinois.  Gas operations represented 20.2 percent of WP&L's
   total operating revenues and 11.1 percent of WP&L's total operating income
   for the year ended December 31, 1995.

             WP&L's gas sales follow a seasonal pattern.  There is an annual
   base load of gas used for heating, cooking, water heating and other
   purposes, with a large peak occurring during the heating season.  WP&L set
   a  new  record for natural gas peak-demand of 258,000 dekatherms on
   January 30-31, 1996.  The previous record of  256,000 dekatherms was set
   on January 14-15, 1995.

   Gas Supplies

             Prior to 1995, WP&L passed on its cost incurred from natural gas
   suppliers and pipeline companies on a dollar-for-dollar basis to its
   customers.  In 1995, the PSCW approved  implementation of a performance-
   based rate mechanism for Wisconsin gas customers.  Under this mechanism,
   fluctuations in the commodity cost of gas above or below  a prescribed
   commodity price index will serve to increase or decrease WP&L's margin on
   gas sales.  Both benefits and exposures are subject to customer sharing
   provisions.  Specifically, to the extent WP&L purchases its gas supply
   below the index price, it will retain 50 percent of the first $1.151
   million in savings; 25 percent of the next $1.151 million; and 10 percent
   of the next $2.878 million.  WP&L's share of the incentive is capped at
   $1.1 million on a pre-tax basis.  The balance of the savings is returned
   to customers.

             During 1995, the Company paid the two pipeline companies serving
   WP&L (ANR Pipeline and Northern Natural Gas Company) $2.6 million in Order
   636 transition costs representing costs incurred by these pipelines in
   transitioning from full service natural gas commodity providers to open
   access gas transmission companies.  In addition, WP&L incurred $.8 million
   of take-or-pay costs paid to pipelines to reform its gas contracts from
   the pre-Order 636 time period.  Both categories of costs were recovered
   100 percent from the Company's gas customers.

             Customers served under South Beloit's gas rate schedules
   continue to pay for gas on a traditional purchase gas adjustment basis.

             In providing gas commodity service to retail gas customers, WP&L
   administers a diversified portfolio of transportation contracts with ANR
   Pipeline and Northern Natural Gas Company allowing access to gas supplies
   from the states of Oklahoma, Louisiana, Texas, and the province of
   Alberta, Canada.  WP&L's transportation contracts provide a maximum daily
   delivery capability of 234,081 dekatherms per day of natural gas as
   follows:

   ANR Pipeline      Northern Natural Gas Company       Non-Traditional

   148,075 Dt             73,556 Dt                      12,450 Dt

            Two non-traditional arrangements provide WP&L with gas delivered
   directly to its "city gate" using the vendors' transportation contract
   with ANR Pipeline.

            WP&L's contracts also allow access to gas stored in underground
   storage fields in the states of Michigan, New Mexico and Oklahoma.  Gas
   purchased in the summer and delivered in the winter comprise 25 percent of
   the Company's annual gas requirements.  

            The Company maintains purchase agreements with over 60 suppliers
   of natural gas from all gas producing regions of the U.S. and Canada. 
   These  include 9 contracts providing for long-term gas deliveries (i.e.,
   with terms ranging from 6 months to 10 years).  These contracts provided
   42 percent of WP&L's annual gas purchases in 1995.   In addition to its
   direct purchase and sales of natural gas, the Company provided
   transportation service to 154 customers who purchased their own gas,
   pursuant to the Company's transportation tariffs.  These customers
   represent 30 percent of total gas moved through WP&L's natural gas
   distribution pipe.

   Manufactured Gas Plant Sites

            Historically, WP&L has owned 11 properties that have been
   associated with the production of manufactured gas.  Currently, WP&L owns
   five of these sites, three are owned by municipalities, and the remaining
   three are owned by private companies.  In 1989, WP&L initiated
   environmental investigations of these manufactured gas plant sites.  The
   DNR has been involved in reviewing investigation plans and has received
   ongoing reports regarding these investigations.

            Through ongoing investigation and studies, WP&L  confirmed that
   there was no contamination at two of the sites and has now received a
   close out letter from the DNR related to each of those sites. 
   Additionally, the investigation of historical records at a third site
   indicated a minimal likelihood of any significant environmental impacts. 
   In 1995, WP&L requested and received a close out letter for the third
   site.

            In February 1993, WP&L completed cost estimates for the
   environmental remediation of the eight remaining sites.  The results of
   this analysis indicate that, during the next 32 years, WP&L will expend
   approximately $77 million for feasibility studies, data collection, soil
   remediation activities, groundwater research and groundwater remediation
   activities, including construction of slurry containment walls and the
   installation of groundwater pump and treatment facilities.  This estimate
   was based on various assumptions, and is subject to continuous review and
   revision by management.

            The cost estimate set forth above assumes 4 percent average
   inflation over the period.  The cost estimate also contemplates that
   primarily groundwater pump and treatment activities will take place after
   1998 through and including 2027.  During this time, WP&L estimates that it
   will incur average annual costs of $2 million to complete the planned
   groundwater remediation activities.

            Through 1995, management  has continued its oversight of the
   issues related to the above manufactured gas plant sites without
   significant revision to the above estimates and assumptions.   With
   respect to rate recovery of these costs, the PSCW has approved a five-year
   amortization of the unamortized balance of environmental costs expended to
   date.  Based on the present regulatory record at the PSCW, management
   believes that future costs of remediating these manufactured gas plant
   sites will be recovered in rates. 

            See  "Item 3. Legal Proceedings" for information  related to the
   manufactured gas plant sites.

            WP&L owns 21,413 miles of electric transmission and distribution
   lines and 362 substations located adjacent to the communities served. 
   Substantially all of WP&L's facilities are subject to the lien of its
   first mortgage bond indenture.

   ITEM 3.  LEGAL PROCEEDINGS

            On July 20, 1995, the City of Beloit ("Beloit") filed a suit
   against WP&L in the Circuit Court of Rock County, Wisconsin alleging that,
   based on negligence, nuisance and trespass, WP&L caused damage to Beloit
   through the contamination of property owned by Beloit as a result of the
   historical operation of manufactured gas plants on the property prior to
   Beloit's acquisition of the property.  The suit seeks damages equal to the
   cost of cleaning up the property, for decrease in the value of the
   property, and to compensate Beloit for lost development opportunities for
   the property as well as consequential damages and costs of the action.

            Beloit and WP&L entered into a Stipulation upon which the Court
   issued an Order staying further proceedings in the action pending further
   environmental investigation of the property and pending WP&L's
   determination of the extent of liability insurance coverage for the
   claims.

            In management's judgement, the probability is remote that this
   action will have a material adverse impact on the Company's financial
   condition.

               On November 6, 1995, WP&L filed the 1994 Depreciation Study
   (Docket 6680-DU-102) with the PSCW.  The study is presently under review. 
   It is anticipated that the study will result in a $4 to $8 million pre-tax
   increase in depreciation expense effective in 1997.  The revised
   depreciation rates are expected to be fully recoverable in WP&L's next
   retail rate order which is scheduled to be effective on January 1, 1997.

                                     PART II
   ITEM 5:  MARKET FOR REGISTRANT'S COMMON EQUITY AND RELATED STOCK HOLDER
            MATTERS

            Effective with the formation of the holding company, all $5 par
   value common stock of the Company was converted into common stock of WPL
   Holdings, Inc.  WPL Holdings is now the sole common shareowner of the
   Company.   The Common Stock outstanding at December 31, 1995 was
   13,326,601 shares.

               Cash dividends paid per share of common stock during 1995 and
   1994 to WPL Holdings, Inc. were $1.07 and 96 cents, respectively, for each
   quarter.

            In accordance with the terms of the Merger Agreement (see
   "Proposed Merger", below),  WPLH is not permitted to declare or pay any
   dividends on any of its capital stock other than the obligations that
   exist with respect to WP&L's cumulative preferred stock, and regular
   quarterly dividends to be paid on WPLH's common stock may not exceed 105
   percent of the dividends from the prior year.

            In the retail rate order effective January 1, 1995, the PSCW
   ordered that no dividend payment in excess of the level forecasted for
   1995 ($58.1 million) may be paid, if such dividend payments would reduce
   WP&L's average common equity ratio below  the test year forecasted level
   of 51.93 percent.

   Proposed Merger

            WPL Holdings, Inc. ("WPLH"), IES Industries Inc. ("IES"), and
   Interstate Power Company ("IPC") have entered into an Agreement and Plan
   of Merger ("Merger Agreement"), dated  November 10, 1995, providing for:
   a) IPC becoming a wholly-owned subsidiary of WPLH, and b) the merger of
   IES with and into WPLH, which merger will result in the combination of IES
   and WPLH as a single holding company (collectively, the "Proposed
   Merger"). 

            The new holding company will be named Interstate Energy
   Corporation ("Interstate Energy").  The Proposed Merger, which will be
   accounted for as a pooling of interests, has been approved by the
   respective Boards of Directors.  It is still subject to approval by the
   shareholders of each company as well as several federal and state
   regulatory agencies.  The companies expect to receive the shareholder
   approvals in the second quarter of 1996 and regulatory approvals by the
   second quarter of 1997.

            The operating revenues, net income from continuing operations
   and total assets of the companies were as follows:

                                                                PRO FORMA
                                                                 COMBINED
                                WPLH        IES        IPC     (Unaudited)
                                                            (in thousands)

    1995 Operating revenues  $807,255     $851,010  $318,542   $1,976,807
    1995 Net income from
    continued operations      $71,618      $64,176   $25,198     $160,992
    Assets at December 31,
    1995                   $1,872,414   $1,985,591  $634,316   $4,492,321


            Under the terms of the Merger Agreement, the outstanding shares
   of WPLH's common stock will remain unchanged and outstanding as shares of
   Interstate Energy.  Each outstanding share of IES common stock will be
   converted to .98 shares of Interstate Energy's common stock.  Each share
   of IPC's common stock will be converted to 1.11 shares of Interstate
   Energy's common stock.  It is anticipated that Interstate Energy will
   retain WPLH's common share dividend payment level as of the effective time
   of the merger.  On January 24, 1996, the Board of Directors of WPLH
   declared a quarterly dividend of 49.25 cents per share.  This represents
   an equivalent annual rate of $1.97 per share.

            IES is a holding company headquartered in Cedar Rapids, Iowa,
   and is the parent company of IES Utilities Inc. ("IES Utilities") and IES
   Diversified Inc. ("IES Diversified").  IES Utilities supplies electric and
   gas service to approximately 333,000 and 174,000 customers, respectively,
   in Iowa.  IES Diversified and its principal subsidiaries are primarily
   engaged in the energy-related, transportation and real estate development
   businesses.  IPC, an operating public utility headquartered in Dubuque,
   Iowa, supplies electric and gas service to approximately 163,000 and
   49,000 customers, respectively, in northeast Iowa, northwest Illinois and
   southern Minnesota. 

            Interstate Energy will be the parent company of  WP&L, IES
   Utilities and IPC and will be registered under the Public Utility Holding
   Company Act of 1935, as amended, ("1935 Act").  The Merger Agreement
   provides that these operating utility companies will continue to operate
   as separate entities for a minimum of three years beyond the effective
   date of  the merger.  In addition, the non-utility operations of WPLH and
   IES Diversified will be combined shortly after the effective date of  the
   merger under one entity to manage the diversified operations of Interstate
   Energy.  The corporate headquarters of Interstate Energy will be in
   Madison, Wisconsin.

            The SEC historically has interpreted the 1935 Act to preclude
   registered holding companies, with limited exceptions, from owning both
   electric and gas utility systems.  Although the SEC has recently
   recommended that registered holding companies be allowed to hold both gas
   and electric utility operations if the affected states agree, it remains
   possible that the SEC may require as a condition to its approval of the
   Proposed Merger that WPLH, IES and IPC divest their gas utility
   properties, and possibly certain non-utility ventures of WPLH and IES,
   within a reasonable time after the effective date of the Proposed Merger.

   MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND
   ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION
   AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

   1995 COMPARED WITH 1994

   OVERVIEW

               Net income of Wisconsin Power and Light Company ("WP&L" or the
   "Company") increased to $75.3 million in 1995 compared with $68.2 million
   in 1994. Net income for 1994 was significantly affected by two non-
   recurring items.  These items were the reversal of a coal contract penalty
   and costs associated with early retirement and severance programs.  The
   coal contract item is discussed in the "Other Events" section of the
   Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of
   Operations ("MD&A").  The following break out (dollars in millions) presents
   the recurring aspects of 1995 and 1994 operations.

               The increase in the "net income before non-recurring items"
   primarily reflects higher electric and gas margins, resulting from an
   increase in weather related sales, and aggressive cost management:

   </TABLE>

        Electric margin  increased 4 percent during 1995 compared with 1994
   primarily due to higher sales combined with  reduced aggregate costs per
   kWh for electric production fuels and purchased power.  Kilowatthour sales
   increased 8 percent due to a much warmer summer than normal, increased
   sales to other utilities, a  2 percent growth in customers, and continued
   economic strength in the service territory.  Partially offsetting these
   sales increases was a  2.8 percent decrease in retail electric rates
   effective January 1, 1995.

        A record setting heat wave resulted in WP&L setting a system peak of
   2,197 megawatts on July 31, 1995. This reflects a 9.7 percent increase
   over the previous record system peak of 2,002 megawatts set in 1994.

        While overall kWh sales increased, the aggregate costs of electric
   production fuels and purchased power remained relatively unchanged. The
   stability of these costs reflects lower coal and transportation costs at
   the Company's generating units in 1995 as well as the availability of
   attractive purchased power opportunities in the bulk power market.

         Gas margin increased 8 percent during 1995 compared with 1994
   primarily as a result higher sales volumes and favorable gas procurement
   strategies.  Therm sales increased 7 percent principally due to
   residential customer growth  reflecting the favorable economic conditions
   in the Company's service territory and  colder than normal weather in the
   fourth quarter, offsetting  a mild January and February.   The 8 percent
   decrease in gas revenues was the result of a pass through to customers of
   the lower cost of purchased gas.  Under the current rate structure, future
   reductions in revenues resulting solely from such pass through would not
   be expected to have a material impact on earnings.  The gas incentive
   program authorized by the Public Service Commission of Wisconsin ("PSCW")
   also resulted in additional pre-tax earnings of $750,000 in 1995.

    Operating Expenses

         The decline in operations expense principally reflects the impact of
   a $13.7 million charge for early retirement and severance costs in 1994. 
   While the Company was able to achieve savings in 1995 from its continued
   reengineering of operations, these savings were offset somewhat by higher
   conservation expenses.  The increase in depreciation expense in 1995 is
   primarily the result of property additions at the utility and higher
   contributions to WP&L's external nuclear decommissioning trust.  Despite
   higher operating income in 1995, the income tax expense was unchanged due
   to prior years' tax adjustments resolved in 1995.

   Other Income And Deductions

         Other income and deductions in 1994 includes after-tax income of
   $5.3 million related to the reversal of a coal contract penalty as
   discussed in the "Other Events" section of the MD&A.  In addition, income
   associated with the allowance for funds used during construction ("AFUDC")
   decreased in 1995 due to significantly lower construction work in progress
   amounts and a lower Federal Energy Regulatory Commission ("FERC") AFUDC
   rate.

   Interest Expense

         Interest expense  increased due to the higher levels of short-term
   debt and higher short-term interest rates. During the second quarter of
   1995, WP&L repurchased $18 million of its Series V bonds from private
   investors. WP&L applied revenue neutral treatment to these reacquired
   bonds which are anticipated to be refinanced in 1996. 


   1994  COMPARED WITH 1993

   OVERVIEW

        Net income of  WP&L increased to $68.2 million in 1994 compared with
   $60.2 million in 1993.  Net income for 1994 was significantly affected by
   two non-recurring items.  These items were the reversal of a coal contract
   penalty,  and costs associated with early retirement and severance
   programs which primarily occurred in the fourth quarter.  The reversal of
   the coal contract penalty is discussed in the "Other Events" section of
   the MD&A.  The following break out (dollars in millions) presents the
   recurring aspects of 1994 and 1993 operations.

        The increase in the "net income before non-recurring items" primarily
   reflects an increase in operating earnings.

               WP&L's electric margin increased 6 percent during 1994
   compared to 1993.  The primary factor was a 3.8 percent retail rate
   increase effective October 1, 1993.  Strong economic conditions in the
   industrial and commercial customer classes and residential customer growth 
   contributed to higher sales.  Electric production fuel costs were
   reasonably stable for 1994.  The volume of purchased power increased as a
   result of WP&L's efforts to conserve coal inventories during a rail strike
   in the third quarter of 1994.  The financial impact on WP&L's operating
   results was not material.

   </TABLE>


         Gas margin increased 9 percent in 1994 from 1993 primarily due to a
   1.4 percent retail rate increase effective October 1, 1993, and higher
   sales to firm service customers. The overall cost of purchased gas
   declined reflecting WP&L's effective use of opportunities on the gas spot
   market.

   Operating Expenses

         Other operation expense increase primarily due to several early
   retirement and severance programs offered in 1994.  The increase in
   depreciation expense in 1995 is primarily the result of increased property
   additions at the utility and higher contributions to the Company's
   external nuclear decommissioning trust.  Income taxes increased between
   years primarily due to higher taxable income.  Partially offsetting these
   costs were reductions in operating costs resulting from the ongoing
   reengineering of processes.  Maintenance expense decreased between years
   due to variation in the timing and extent of maintenance on generating
   facilities between years.  Secondarily, a severe storm in the summer of
   1993 increased 1993's maintenance expense related to service restoration. 

   Other Income and (Deductions)

         Other income increased resulting from the  reversal of a coal
   contract penalty which is discussed in the  "Other Events" section of the
   MD&A.

   Interest Expense

         Interest expense decreased primarily due to the lower short-term
   debt interest.

   LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES

         During 1995 and 1994 the Company generated sufficient cash flows
   from operations and short-term borrowings to cover operating expenses,
   cash dividends, and investment activities.  In 1993, cash flows from
   operations covered a portion of investing activities, the remainder was
   generated through the issuance of common stock and long and short-term
   debt.  Cash flows from operations increased to $196 million in 1995
   compared with $187 million and $153 million in 1994 and 1993,
   respectively.

   Rates and Regulatory Matters

         Effective January 1, 1995, for the two-year period ended December
   31, 1996, the PSCW in rate order UR-109, authorized a 2.8 percent annual
   decrease in electric rates, a .5 percent annual increase in gas rates and
   a decline in the allowed return on common equity to 11.5 percent from the
   previous 11.6 percent.  None of these events is expected to have a
   material impact on earnings.  Further, the PSCW approved certain incentive
   programs described below:

   1.    The retail electric fuel adjustment mechanism, which allowed costs
   to fluctuate within a 3 percent band width, was eliminated.  The
   elimination of the adjustment mechanism did not have a material effect on
   1995 earnings and is not expected to materially impact 1996 results. 

   2.    The automatic purchased gas adjustment clause was also eliminated. 
   The fluctuations in the commodity cost of gas above or below a prescribed
   commodity price index will serve to increase or decrease WP&L's margin on
   gas sales.  Both benefits and exposures are subject to customer sharing
   provisions. WP&L's share is capped at $1.1 million pre-tax.   For 1995,
   WP&L earned $750,000 pre-tax under this incentive mechanism.  The
   customers' share of this program is $1.1 million pre-tax which will be
   refunded to customers in April 1996.  The refund has been fully reserved
   in the 1995 financial results.  The Company uses gas commodity swaps to
   hedge the price risks associated with the purchase and sale of stored gas.

   3.    In order to promote air quality and delivery system reliability,
   there are SO2 emissions and service reliability incentive clauses. 
   Positive incentives available under these clauses include $1.5 million 
   pre-tax for the SO2 emissions and $.5 million pre-tax for the service
   reliability.  WP&L's earnings are also negatively exposed for equal
   amounts.  For calendar year 1995, WP&L collected $2.0 million pre-tax in
   revenues and also deferred $2.1 million pre-tax in revenues.   WP&L plans
   to refund this amount to customers in  April 1996, resulting in no
   material impact on 1995 revenues. 

   Industry Outlook

             WP&L is subject to regulation by the PSCW and the FERC.  The
   stated goal of the PSCW in its natural gas docket is to move all gas
   supply activities out of the existing regulated distribution utilities and
   allow independent units to compete for the business.  The goal of the
   electric utility restructuring process is to create open access
   transmission and distribution services for all customers with competitive
   generation  and customer service markets.  Additional proceedings as well
   as consultation with the legislature are planned prior to a target
   implementation date after the year 2000.  The Company cannot currently
   predict what impact, if any, these proceedings may have on its future
   financial condition or results of operations.  The Company believes,
   however, that it is well positioned to compete in a deregulated
   environment.  WP&L's rates to all customer classes are competitive
   within the state of Wisconsin and below the average in the Midwest region.


              The FERC is developing regulation which will begin to provide
   open access to utility transmission facilities for wholesale electric
   customers subject to certain approved FERC tariffs.  WP&L believes its
   existing open access tariffs position it well to compete under such market
   conditions.  

   Financing and Capital Structure

             The level of short-term borrowings fluctuates based on seasonal
   corporate needs, the timing of long-term financing, and capital market
   conditions.  WP&L generally borrows on a short-term basis to provide
   interim financing of construction and capital expenditures in excess of
   available internally-generated funds.  WP&L periodically reduces its
   outstanding short-term borrowings through the issuance of long-term debt
   and through  WPL Holdings, Inc.'s additional investment in its common
   equity.  To maintain flexibility in its capital structure and to take
   advantage of favorable short-term rates, WP&L also uses proceeds from the
   sales of accounts receivable and unbilled revenues to finance a portion of
   its long-term cash needs.  The Company also anticipates that short-term
   debt funds will continue to be available at reasonable costs due to strong
   ratings by independent utility analysts and rating services.  Commercial
   paper has been rated A-1+ by Standard & Poor's Corp. and P-1 by Moody's
   Investors Service.   Bank lines of credit of $70 million at December 31,
   1995, are available to support these borrowings.

             The Company has only limited involvement with derivative
   financial instruments and does not use them for trading purposes. They are
   used to manage well-defined interest rate and gas commodity price risks.
   The Company enters into interest rate swap agreements to reduce the impact
   of changes in interest rates on its floating-rate long-term debt, short-
   term debt and the sales of its accounts receivable.  The total notional
   amount of interest rate swaps was $123 million and $150 million,
   respectively, for the years ended December 31, 1995 and 1994. The Company
   uses gas commodity swaps to hedge the price risks associated with the
   purchase and sale of stored gas.

             The Company's capitalization at December 31, 1995, including the
   current maturities of long-term debt, variable rate demand bonds and
   short-term debt, consisted of 53 percent common equity, 6 percent
   preferred stock and 41 percent debt.  The common equity to total
   capitalization ratio at December 31, 1995, increased to 53 percent from 52
   percent at December 31, 1994.

             In accordance with the terms of the Merger Agreement (See "Other
   Events" section of the MD&A.), WPLH may not declare or pay any dividends
   on any of its capital stock other than the obligations that exist with
   respect to cumulative preferred stock, and regular quarterly dividends on
   common stock may not to exceed 105 percent of the common stock dividends
   from the prior year.
    
             The retail rate order received effective January 1, 1995,
   requires WP&L to maintain a utility common equity level of 51.93 percent
   of total utility capitalization during the two-year period ending December
   31, 1996.  In addition, the PSCW ordered that it must approve the payment
   of dividends by WP&L to WPLH that are in excess of the level forecasted
   for 1995 ($58.1 million), if such dividends would reduce WP&L's average
   common equity ratio below 51.93 percent.  At December 31, 1995, WP&L's
   common equity ratio was 52.6 percent.  

   Capital Requirements  

             WP&L is a capital-intensive business and requires large
   investments in long-lived assets.  Therefore, the Company's most
   significant capital requirements relate to construction expenditures. 
   Additions to utility plant decreased in 1995 by $29.6 million and in 1994
   by $25.9 million primarily due to the completion of two 86-megawatt
   combustion-turbine generators in 1994.  Estimated capital requirements for
   the next five years are as follows:

      Included in the construction expenditure estimates, in addition to the
   recurring additions and improvements to the distribution and transmission
   systems, are the following: 1) expenditures for managing and controlling
   electric line losses and for the electric delivery system to enhance
   WP&L's interconnection capability with other utilities; 2) expenditures
   related to upgrading computer systems to improve productivity and customer
   service; and 3) expenditures associated with the construction of an
   86-megawatt combustion-turbine generator expected to become operational in
   1996. The decommissioning  expenditures represent both the amount of
   annual contribution to external trust funds and the income earned on the
   external trust funds. These amounts are recorded in depreciation expense
   and recovered in rates. WP&L expects to contribute $10.7 million annually
   to this fund.

        The steam generator tubes at Kewaunee are susceptible to corrosion
   characteristics seen throughout the nuclear industry.  During the first
   quarter of 1995, Kewaunee was shutdown for scheduled maintenance and
   refueling.  Inspection of the steam generators revealed increased levels
   of tube degeneration.  Prior to shutdown the equivalent of approximately
   12 percent of the tubes in the steam generators were plugged, with no loss
   of capacity.  When the plant was returned to service in May 1995
   approximately 21 percent of the tubes were plugged.

        As a result of the need to address the repair or replacement of the
   steam generators, the owners of Kewaunee have been, and are continuing to,
   evaluate various alternatives to deal with the loss of capacity resulting
   from the continuing degradation of the steam generator tubes.  As part of
   this evaluation the owners have:

      (a)   submitted a request to the NRC to redefine the pressure boundary
            point of the repaired steam generator tubes (sleeved tubes) which
            have been removed from service by plugging, in order to allow the
            return of many of the sleeved tubes to service.  If the request
            is granted, even if additional degraded tubes would be discovered
            during the next planned shutdown in the fall of 1996, the
            requested redefinition of the pressure boundary point should
            allow the plant to return to full output.  Testing of three tubes
            removed during the 1995 refueling outage indicates structural
            soundness equal to the original tube strength.  Management
            believes the request will be granted by the NRC;

      (b)   requested approval from the NRC to pursue welded repair
            technologies to return plugged tubes to service.  Although welded
            tube repair technologies exist, the technology is not presently
            approved by the NRC; and 

      (c)   continued to evaluate the economics of replacement of the steam
            generators.  The replacement of steam generators is estimated to
            cost approximately $100 million, exclusive of additional
            purchased power costs associated with an extended shutdown.

        The owners continue to evaluate the potential financial and
   regulatory implications of a change in ownership (which would likely
   require, as a condition precedent, authority to replace the steam
   generator) or early shutdown of Kewaunee.   WP&L believes that the best
   near term economic alternative for the owners of Kewaunee is to continue
   to pursue tube recovery and repair processes.  WP&L will reassess its
   views of available alternatives based on the condition of the steam
   generator tubes during the fall 1996 refueling outage.  On December 31,
   1995, the net book value of WP&L's share of Kewaunee was $57.0 million.  

        Physical decommissioning of Kewaunee is expected to occur during the
   period 2014 to 2021 with additional expenditures being incurred during the
   period 2022 to 2050 related to the storage of spent nuclear fuel at the
   site.  The undiscounted amount of decommissioning costs estimated to be
   expended between the years 2014 and 2050 is $1,016 million.  Wisconsin
   utilities operating nuclear generating plants are required by the PSCW to
   establish external trust funds to provide for the decommissioning of such
   plants. WP&L's share of the decommissioning costs is estimated to be $169
   million in 1995 dollars, assuming the plant is operating through 2013,
   based on a 1992 site-specific study, using the immediate dismantlement
   method of decommissioning.  The market value of the investments in the
   funds established by WP&L at December 31, 1995, totaled $73.4 million.  

   Capital Resources

        One of the Company's objectives is to finance construction
   expenditures through internally generated funds supplemented, when
   required, by outside financing.  With this objective in place, the Company
   has financed an average of 68 percent of its construction expenditures
   during the past five years from internal sources.  However, during the
   next five years, the Company expects this percentage to increase primarily
   due to relatively stable level of construction expenditures and higher
   depreciation rates beginning in 1997.  External financing sources such as
   the issuance of long-term debt, short-term borrowings and equity
   contributions from its parent, WPL Holdings, Inc. will be used by the
   Company to finance the remaining construction expenditure requirements for
   this period.  Expectations are that approximately $60 million of long-term
   debt will be issued in 1996.

   NEW ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS
         
            In October 1995, the Financial Accounting Standards Board
   ("FASB") issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 123
   "Accounting for Stock Based Compensation Plans" which establishes
   standards of financial accounting and reporting for stock based
   compensation plans.  As allowed under SFAS No. 123, WP&L will continue to
   apply APB No. 25, "Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees," in
   accounting for stock based compensation plans when the statement becomes
   effective in 1996.  As a result, this statement will have no impact on the
   financial position or results of operations of WP&L. 

            In March 1995, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued
   Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 121, "Accounting for the
   Impairment of Long-Lived Assets and Long-Lived Assets to be Disposed Of." 
   This statement imposes stricter criteria for evaluating the recoverability
   of regulatory assets.  WP&L adopted this standard on January 1, 1996, and
   does not expect that adoption will have a material impact on the financial
   position or results of  operations of  the Company.  This conclusion may
   change in the future as competitive factors influence wholesale and retail
   pricing in the utility.

   INFLATION

            The impacts of inflation on WP&L are currently mitigated through
   current ratemaking methodologies.  Although rates will be held flat until
   at least 1997, management expects that any impact of inflation will be
   mitigated by customer growth and productivity improvements.

   OTHER EVENTS

   Coal Contract Penalty

            In November 1989, the PSCW concluded that WP&L did not properly
   administer a coal contract, resulting in an assessment to compensate
   ratepayers for excess fuel costs having been incurred.  As a result, WP&L
   recorded a reserve in 1989 that had an after-tax effect of reducing 1989
   net income by $4.9 million.  The PSCW decision was found to represent
   unlawful retroactive rate-making by both the Dane County Circuit Court and
   the Wisconsin Court of Appeals.  The case was then appealed to the
   Wisconsin Supreme Court.

            In January 1994, the Wisconsin Supreme Court affirmed the
   decisions of the Dane County Circuit Court and Wisconsin Court of Appeals. 
   In management's opinion, all avenues for appeal have been exhausted.  As a
   result, WP&L reversed the entire reserve and was also allowed to collect
   interest on amounts of the penalty previously refunded to ratepayers.  The
   reversal of the reserve plus interest had an after-tax affect of
   increasing net income in 1994 by $5.3 million.

   Merger Proposal

            WPL Holdings, Inc. ("WPLH"), IES Industries Inc. ("IES"), and
   Interstate Power Company ("IPC") have entered into an Agreement and Plan
   of Merger ("Merger Agreement"), dated  November 10, 1995, providing for:
   a) IPC becoming a wholly-owned subsidiary of WPLH, and b) the merger of
   IES with and into WPLH, which merger will result in the combination of IES
   and WPLH as a single holding company (collectively, the "Proposed
   Merger").  

            The new holding company will be named Interstate Energy
   Corporation ("Interstate Energy").  The Proposed Merger, which will be
   accounted for as a pooling of interests, has been approved by the
   respective Board of Directors.  It is still  subject to approval by the
   shareholders of each company as well as several federal and state
   regulatory agencies.  The companies expect to receive the shareholder
   approvals in the second quarter of 1996 and regulatory approvals by the
   second quarter of 1997.  The corporate headquarters of Interstate Energy
   will be in Madison.  

            The business of Interstate Energy will consist of utility
   operations and various non-utility enterprises, and it is expected that
   its utility subsidiaries will serve more than 870,000 electric customers
   and 360,000 natural gas customers in Iowa, Illinois, Minnesota and
   Wisconsin.

            The operating revenues, net income from continuing operations
   and total assets of the companies were as follows:

                                                                  PRO FORMA
                                                                  COMBINED
                                   WPLH       IES        IPC     (Unaudited)
                                                              (in thousands)

  1995 Operating revenues      $807,255    $851,010   $318,542   $1,976,807
  1995 Net income from
    continued operations        $71,618     $64,176    $25,198     $160,992
  Assets at December 31,
    1995                     $1,872,414  $1,985,591   $634,316   $4,492,321

            Under the terms of the Merger Agreement, the outstanding shares
   of WPLH's common stock will remain unchanged and outstanding as shares of
   Interstate Energy.  Each outstanding share of IES common stock will be
   converted to .98 shares of Interstate Energy's common stock.  Each share
   of IPC's common stock will be converted to 1.11 shares of Interstate
   Energy's common stock.  It is anticipated that Interstate Energy will
   retain WPLH's common share dividend payment level as of the effective time
   of the merger.  On January 24, 1996, the Board of Directors of WPL
   Holdings, Inc. declared a quarterly dividend of 49.25 cents.  This
   represents an equivalent annual rate of $1.97 per share.

            Interstate Energy will be the parent company of  Wisconsin Power
   and Light Company, IES Utilities and  IPC and will be registered under the
   Public Utility Holding Company Act of 1935, as amended ("1935 Act").  The
   Merger Agreement provides that these operating utility companies will
   continue to operate as separate entities for a minimum of three years
   beyond the effective date of  the merger.  In addition, the non-utility
   operations of WPLH and IES Diversified will be combined shortly after the
   effective date of  the merger under one entity to manage the diversified
   operations of Interstate Energy.  

            The SEC historically has interpreted the 1935 Act to preclude
   registered holding companies, with limited exceptions, from owning both
   electric and gas utility systems.  Although the SEC has recently
   recommended that registered holding companies be allowed to hold both gas
   and electric utility operations if the affected states agree, it remains
   possible that the SEC may require as a condition to its approval of the
   Proposed Merger that WPLH, IES and IPC divest their gas utility
   properties, and possibly certain non-utility ventures of WPLH and IES,
   within a reasonable time after the effective date of the Proposed Merger.

            Legislation to repeal the 1935 Act was introduced in Congress in
   1995 and is pending.  No assurance can be given as to when or if such
   legislation will be considered or enacted.  The Staff of the SEC has also
   recommended that the SEC "permit combination systems by registered holding
   companies if the affected states concur," and the SEC has proposed rules
   that would relax current restrictions on investment by registered holding
   companies in certain "energy related," non-utility businesses.  No
   prediction can be made as to the outcome of these legislative and
   regulatory proposals.

   Union Contract

            The three year contract  WP&L has with the International
   Brotherhood of Electrical Workers, Local 965 is in effect until June 1,
   1996. The contract covers 1,601 of  WP&L's employees which represents
   approximately 69 percent of the total employees at December 31, 1995.  At
   this time the results of negotiations cannot be estimated. 

   Environmental

             WP&L cannot precisely forecast the effect of future
   environmental regulations by federal, state and local authorities upon its
   generating, transmission and other facilities, or its operations, but has
   taken steps to anticipate the future while meeting the requirements of
   current environmental regulations.  The Clean Air Act Amendments of 1977
   and subsequent amendments to the Clean Air Act, as well as the new laws
   affecting the handling and disposal of solid and hazardous wastes, could
   affect the siting, construction and operating costs of both present and
   future generating units.

            Under the Federal Clean Water Act, National Pollutant Discharge
   Elimination System permits for generating station discharge into water
   ways are required to be obtained from the Wisconsin Department of Natural
   Resources ("DNR") to which the permit program has been delegated. These
   permits must be periodically reviewed.  WP&L has obtained such permits for
   all of its generating stations or has filed timely applications for
   renewals of such permits.

            Air quality regulations promulgated by the DNR in accordance
   with Federal standards impose statewide restrictions on the emission of
   particulates, sulfur dioxide, nitrogen oxides and other air pollutants and
   require permits from the DNR for the operation of emission sources.  WP&L
   currently has the necessary permits to operate its fossil-fueled
   generating facilities.  While periodic exceedances in air emissions may
   occur, management promptly acts on these excursions and works with the DNR
   to resolve any permit compliance issues.   With the passage of the new
   Federal Clean Air Act Amendments, the state is required to include these
   provisions in its permit requirements.  WP&L has submitted timely Title V
   permit applications in compliance with schedules set forth by the
   regulators.  WP&L has also completed application for Phase II permits
   under the Clean Air Act in compliance with the time lines identified.  The
   state Title V operating permits, when issued, will consolidate all
   existing air permit conditions and regulatory requirements into one permit
   for each facility.  Permits are expected to be issued in 1996.  Until such
   time, the facilities will continue to operate under their existing permit
   conditions. 

            WP&L's compliance strategy for Wisconsin's sulfur dioxide law
   (discussed above) and the Federal Clean Air Act Amendments required plant
   upgrades at its generating facilities.  The majority of these projects
   were completed in 1993.  WP&L has installed continuous emission monitoring
   systems at all of its coal fired boilers in compliance with federal
   requirements.  Monitoring for sulfur dioxide was also required by Title IV
   of the Federal Clean Air Act at WP&L's South Fond du Lac combustion
   turbine site.  These requirements were also met.  Additional monitoring
   systems for nitrogen oxides are required in 1996 at the combustion-turbine
   site.  WP&L  has  installed these monitors, and will complete
   certification tests for the equipment by May 1996.  No significant
   investments are anticipated at this time to meet the requirements of the
   Federal Clean Air Act Amendments.

            For a discussion of the Company's liability regarding
   environmental remediation at certain manufactured gas plant sites formerly
   operated by WP&L, see Note 11 of "Notes to Consolidated Financial
   Statements."

   Dividend Declaration

            On January 24, 1996, the Board of Directors of WPL Holdings,
   Inc. declared a quarterly dividend on common stock.  The dividend is 49.25
   cents per share payable February 15 to shareowners of record on February
   2, 1996.


   ITEM 8.     FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND SUPPLEMENTARY DATA



   REPORT OF INDEPENDENT PUBLIC ACCOUNTANTS

   To Wisconsin Power and Light Company:

   We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets and
   statements of capitalization of Wisconsin Power and Light Company (a
   Wisconsin corporation) and subsidiaries as of December 31, 1995 and 1994,
   and the related consolidated statements of income, common shareowners'
   investment and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended
   December 31, 1995.  These financial statements are the responsibility of
   the Company's management.  Our responsibility is to express an opinion on
   these financial statements based on our audits.

   We conducted our audits in accordance with generally accepted auditing
   standards.  Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to
   obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are
   free of material misstatement.  An audit includes examining, on a test
   basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial
   statements.  An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles
   used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating
   the overall financial statement presentation.  We believe that our audits
   provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.

   In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present fairly,
   in all material respects, the financial position of Wisconsin Power and
   Light Company and subsidiaries as of December 31, 1995 and 1994, and the
   results of their operations and their cash flows for each of the three
   years in the period ended December 31, 1995, in conformity with generally
   accepted accounting principles.

   WISCONSIN POWER AND LIGHT COMPANY

   NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 
   (dollars in thousands except as otherwise indicated)

   NOTE 1.   SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING AND REPORTING POLICIES:

   a.      Business and Consolidation:

           Wisconsin Power and Light Company ("WP&L" or the "Company") is a
   subsidiary of WPL Holdings, Inc. ("WPLH").

           WP&L is a public utility predominantly engaged in the transmission
   and distribution of electric energy and the generation and bulk purchase
   of electric energy for sale.  WP&L also transports, distributes and sells
   natural gas purchased from gas suppliers.  Nearly all of WP&L's retail
   customers are located in south and central Wisconsin.  WP&L's principal
   consolidated subsidiary is South Beloit Water, Gas and Electric Company. 
   Certain amounts from prior years have been reclassified to conform with
   the current year presentation.

   b.      Regulation:

           WP&L's financial records are maintained in accordance with the
   uniform system of accounts prescribed by its regulators.  The Public
   Service Commission of Wisconsin ("PSCW") and the Illinois Commerce
   Commission have jurisdiction over retail rates, which represent
   approximately 82 percent of electric revenues plus all gas revenues.  The
   Federal Energy Regulatory Commission ("FERC") has jurisdiction over
   wholesale electric rates representing the balance of electric revenues. 
   Statement of Financial Accounting Standards ("SFAS") No. 71, "Accounting
   for the Effects of Certain Types of Regulation" provides that rate-
   regulated public utilities such as WP&L record certain costs and credits
   allowed in the ratemaking process in different periods than for
   unregulated entities.  These are deferred as regulatory assets or
   regulatory liabilities and are recognized in the Consolidated Statements
   of Income at the time they are reflected in rates. 

   c.      Use of Estimates:

           The preparation of financial statements in conformity with
   generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make
   estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and
   liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the
   date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and
   expenses during the reporting period.  Actual results will, in most cases,
   differ from those estimates.

   d.      Utility Plant and Other Property and Equipment:

           Utility plant and other property and equipment are recorded at
   original cost and cost, respectively.  Utility plant costs include
   financing costs that are capitalized using the FERC method for allowance
   for funds used during construction ("AFUDC").  The AFUDC capitalization
   rate for 1995 was 6.68 percent.  These capitalized costs are recovered in
   rates as the cost of the utility plant is depreciated.

           Normal repairs, maintenance and minor items of utility plant and
   other property and equipment are expensed.  Ordinary utility plant
   retirements, including removal costs less salvage value, are charged to
   accumulated depreciation upon removal from utility plant accounts, and no
   gain or loss is recognized.  Upon retirement or sale of other property and
   equipment, the cost and related accumulated depreciation are removed from
   the accounts and any gain or loss is included in other income and
   deductions. 

   e.      Depreciation:

           The Company uses the straight-line method of depreciation.  For
   utility plant, straight-line depreciation is computed on the average
   balance of depreciable property at individual straight-line PSCW approved
   rates that consider the estimated useful life and removal cost or salvage
   value as follows:

                          Electric       Gas         Water        Common
             1995           3.3%         3.7%         2.5%         7.9%
             1994           3.2%         3.7%         2.5%         7.2%
             1993           3.2%         3.7%         2.5%         7.3%

           Depreciation expense related to WP&L's share of the
   decommissioning of the Kewaunee Nuclear Power Plant is discussed in "Note
   11 Commitments and Contingencies."  WP&L has filed a depreciation rate
   case with the PSCW requesting higher depreciation rates, which if
   approved, will be effective in 1997.

           Estimated useful lives related to other property and equipment are
   from 3 to 12 years for equipment and 31.5 to 40 years for buildings.

   f.      Nuclear Fuel:

           Nuclear fuel is recorded at its original cost and is amortized to
   expense based upon the quantity of heat produced for the generation of
   electricity.  This accumulated amortization assumes spent nuclear fuel
   will have no residual value.  Estimated future disposal costs of such fuel
   are expensed based on kilowatthours generated.

   g.      Revenue:

           WP&L accrues utility revenues for services provided but not yet
   billed.

   h.      Electric Production Fuels and Purchased Gas:

      (1) Electric Production Fuels:

          Through 1994, the PSCW retail electric rates provided a range from
          which actual fuel costs could vary in relation to costs forecasted
          and used in rates.  If actual fuel costs fell outside this range, a
          hearing could be held to determine if a rate change was necessary,
          and a rate increase or decrease could result.

          Beginning with WP&L's latest rate order UR-109, effective January
          1, 1995, the automatic fuel adjustment clause was eliminated.  In
          its absence, WP&L will benefit from reductions in fuel cost. 
          Conversely, WP&L will be exposed to increases in fuel costs.

          An automatic fuel adjustment clause for the FERC wholesale portion
          of WP&L's electric business and South Beloit's retail rates
          operates to increase or decrease monthly rates based on changes in
          fuel costs.

      (2) Purchased Gas:

          Through 1994, WP&L's base gas cost recovery rates permitted the
          recovery of, or refund to, all customers for any increases or
          decreases in the cost of gas purchased from WP&L's suppliers
          through a monthly purchased gas adjustment clause.

          Beginning with UR-109, the monthly purchased gas adjustment clause
          was also eliminated.  Thus, the fluctuations in the commodity cost
          of gas above or below a prescribed commodity price index will serve
          to increase or decrease WP&L's margin on gas sales.  Fixed demand
          costs are excluded from the incentive program.  Both benefits and
          exposures are subject to customer sharing provisions.  WP&L's share
          is  capped at $1.1 million pre-tax.

   i.     Cash and Equivalents:

          The Company considers all highly liquid debt instruments purchased
   with a maturity of three months or less to be cash equivalents.  The
   carrying amount approximates fair value because of the short maturity of
   these items.

   j.     Income Taxes:

          Under the terms of an agreement with WPLH, the Company calculates
   its federal tax provisions and makes payments to WPLH as if it were a
   separate taxable entity.

          Beginning in 1993, WP&L fully provides deferred income taxes in
   accordance with SFAS No.109, "Accounting for Income Taxes", to reflect tax
   effects of reporting book and tax items in different periods.  Investment
   tax credits are accounted for on a deferred basis and reflected in income
   ratably over the life of related property.

   NOTE 2.  JOINTLY OWNED UTILITY PLANTS:
    
     WP&L participates with other Wisconsin utilities in the construction
   and operation of several jointly owned utility generating plants.  The
   chart below represents WP&L's proportionate share of such plants as
   reflected in the Consolidated Balance Sheets at December 31, 1995 and
   1994.

        Each of the respective joint owners finances its portion of
   construction costs.  WP&L's share of operation and maintenance expenses is
   included in the Consolidated Statements of Income.

   NOTE 3.  NET ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE:

            WP&L has a contract with a financial organization to sell, with
   limited recourse, certain accounts receivable and unbilled revenues. 
   These receivables include customer receivables, sales to other public
   utilities and billings to the co-owners of the jointly owned electric
   generating plants that WP&L operates.  

      The contract allows WP&L to sell up to $150 million of receivables at
   any time.  Expenses related to the sale of receivables are paid to the
   financial organization under this contract and include, along with various
   other fees, a monthly discount charge on the outstanding balance of
   receivables sold that approximated a 5.94 percent annual rate during 1995. 
   These costs are recovered in retail utility rates as an operating expense. 
   All billing and collection functions remain the responsibility of WP&L. 
   The contract expires August 16, 1998, unless extended by mutual agreement.

            As of December 31, 1995 and 1994, the balance of sold accounts
   receivable that had not been collected totaled $79.5 million and $76.5
   million, respectively.  During 1995, the monthly proceeds from the sale of
   accounts receivable averaged $77.5 million, compared with $82.3 million in
   1994.

            The Company does not have any significant concentrations of
   credit risk in the December 31, 1995 and 1994 net accounts receivable
   balances.

   NOTE 4.  REGULATORY ASSETS AND REGULATORY LIABILITIES:

            Certain costs and credits are deferred and amortized in
   accordance with authorized or expected ratemaking treatment.  As of
   December 31, 1995 and 1994, regulatory created assets include the
   following:

                                                  1995          1994

                                              ========      ========


            The PSCW, in  rate case UR-108, ordered the recovery of
   environmental remediation costs incurred be deferred and amortized over a
   five-year period with  no recovery of the carrying costs on the
   unamortized balance.  

            As of December 31, 1995 and 1994, WP&L had recorded regulatory
   related liabilities of  $37,898 and $42,803,  respectively.  These
   liabilities are primarily tax related.

            In March 1995, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued
   SFAS No. 121, "Accounting for the Impairment of Long-Lived Assets and
   Long-Lived Assets to be Disposed Of."  This statement imposes stricter
   criteria for regulatory assets by requiring that such assets be probable
   of future recovery at each balance sheet date.  The Company adopted this
   standard on January 1, 1996, and does not expect that adoption will have a
   material impact on the financial position or results of operations of the
   Company based on the current regulatory structure in which the Company
   operates.  This conclusion may change in the future as competitive factors
   influence wholesale and retail pricing in this industry.  

   NOTE 5.  EMPLOYEE BENEFIT PLANS:

   a.        Pension Plans:

            WP&L has noncontributory, defined benefit retirement plans
   covering substantially all employees.  The benefits are based upon years
   of service and levels of compensation.  WP&L's funding policy is to
   contribute at least the statutory minimum to a trust.

            The projected unit credit actuarial cost method was used to
   compute net pension costs and the accumulated and projected benefit
   obligations.  The discount rate used in determining those benefit
   obligations was 7.25, 8.25 and 7.25 percent for 1995, 1994 and 1993,
   respectively.  The long-term rate of return on assets used in determining
   those benefit obligations was 9.00, 9.00 and 9.75 percent for 1995, 1994,
   and 1993, respectively.

            The following table sets forth the funded status of the WP&L
   plans and amounts recognized in the Company's Consolidated Balance Sheets
   at December 31, 1995 and 1994:

          The net pension cost (benefit) recognized in the Consolidated
   Statements of Income for 1995, 1994 and 1993 included the following
   components:

   b.        Postretirement Health Care and Life Insurance:

             Effective January 1, 1993, the Company prospectively adopted
   SFAS No. 106, "Employers' Accounting for Postretirement Benefits Other
   Than Pensions".  SFAS No. 106 establishes standards of financial
   accounting and reporting for the Company's postretirement health care and
   life insurance benefits.  SFAS No. 106 requires the accrual of the
   expected cost of such benefits during the employees' years of service
   based on actuarial methodologies that closely parallel pension accounting
   requirements.  WP&L has elected delayed recognition of the transition
   obligation and is amortizing the discounted present value of the
   transition obligation to expense over 20 years.  The cost of providing
   postretirement benefits, including the transition obligation, is being
   recovered in retail rates under current regulatory practices.


   The following table sets forth the plans' funded status:

                                          1995        1994

                                      ========     =======

        The net postretirement benefits cost recognized in the Consolidated
   Statements of Income for 1995, 1994 and 1993 included the following
   components:


                              1995         1994       1993
   Service cost             $1,495      $1,739      $1,463

   Interest cost on
    projected benefit 
    obligation               3,567       3,135       3,151
   Actual return on assets  (2,051)       (253)       (696)

   Amortization of
    transition obligation    1,471       1,527       1,560
   Amortization and
    deferral                 1,313        (381)        (27)
                           -------      ------       -----
   Net postretirement
    benefits cost           $5,795      $5,767      $5,451
                            ======      ======      ======

             The postretirement benefits cost components for 1995 were
   calculated assuming health-care cost trend rates ranging from 11.5 percent
   for 1995 and decreasing to 5.0 percent by the year 2002.  The health-care
   cost trend rate considers estimates of health care inflation, changes in
   utilization or delivery, technological advances, and changes in the health
   status of the plan participants.  Increasing the health-care cost trend
   rate by one percentage point in each year would increase the accumulated
   postretirement benefit obligation as of December 31, 1995, by $2.8 
   million and the aggregate of the service and interest cost components of
   the net periodic postretirement benefit cost for the year by $.5 million.

             The assumed discount rate used in determining the accumulated
   postretirement obligation was 7.25, 8.25 and 7.25 percent in 1995, 1994
   and 1993, respectively.  The long-term rate of return on assets was 9.00,
   9.00 and 9.50 percent in 1995, 1994 and 1993, respectively.  Plan assets
   are primarily invested in common stock, bonds and fixed income securities. 
   The Company's funding policy is to contribute the tax-advantaged maximum
   to a trust.

   c.        Other Post-employment Benefits:

             In November 1992, the Financial Accounting Standards Board
   issued SFAS No. 112, "Employers' Accounting for Post-employment Benefits." 
   SFAS No. 112, which was effective January 1, 1994, establishes standards
   of financial accounting and reporting for the estimated cost of benefits
   provided by an employer to former or inactive employees after employment
   but before retirement.  The effect of adopting SFAS No. 112 was not
   material to the Company's financial position and results of operations.

   d.         Long-Term Equity Incentive Plan

             On January 23, 1994, the Company adopted the "WPL Holdings, Inc.
   Long-Term Equity Incentive Plan" (the "Plan") which permits the grant of
   non-qualified stock options and performance units.  To date, 41,900 non-
   qualified stock options and equivalent performance units have been
   granted.  The non-qualified stock options have a per-share option price of
   $27.50.  There were no options exercised during the year nor exercisable
   at year-end.

             The following table reconciles the statutory federal income tax
   rate to the effective income tax rate:

            Changes in WP&L's deferred income taxes arising from the
   adoption of SFAS No. 109 represent amounts recoverable or refundable
   through future rates and have been recorded as net regulatory assets on
   the Consolidated Balance Sheets.  These net regulatory assets are being
   recovered in rates over the estimated remaining useful lives of the assets
   to which they pertain. 

   NOTE 7.  SHORT-TERM DEBT AND LINES OF CREDIT:

            The Company maintains committed bank lines of credit, most of
   which are at the bank prime rates, to obtain short-term borrowing
   flexibility, including pledging lines of credit as security for any
   commercial paper outstanding.  Amounts available under these lines of
   credit totaled $70 million as of December 31, 1995.  Information regarding
   short-term debt and lines of credit is as follows:

   NOTE  8.  DERIVATIVE FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS 

            The Company has only limited involvement with derivative
   financial instruments and does not use them for trading purposes.  They
   are used to manage well-defined interest rate and gas commodity price
   risks.

            The Company enters into interest rate swap agreements to reduce
   the impact of changes in interest rates on its floating-rate debt and fees
   associated with the sale of its accounts receivable.  The notional
   principal amount of interest rate swaps outstanding as of December 31,
   1995, was $123 million.  Average variable rates are based on rates implied
   in the forward yield curve at the reporting date.  The average pay and
   receive rates associated with these agreements are 5.27 percent and 5.31
   percent, respectively.  The swap agreements have contract maturities from
   one-and-a half to five years.  It is not the Company's intent to terminate
   these contracts, however, the total cost to the Company if it were to
   terminate all of the agreements existing at December 31, 1995, is $.8
   million.  In addition, the Company entered into an interest rate forward
   contract related to the anticipated issuance of $60 million of long-term
   debt securities.  At December 31, 1995, the forward contract, if settled
   on that date, would have required a payment by the Company of
   approximately $6.7 million.  The financial impact of this contract, which
   will result in either a cash payment or cash receipt, will be deferred and
   recognized as an adjustment to interest expense over the life of the new
   bonds to effect the interest rate implicit in the forward contract.

            The Company uses gas commodity swaps to reduce the impact of
   price fluctuations on gas purchased and injected into storage during the
   summer months and withdrawn and sold at current market prices during the
   winter months.  Variances between underlying commodity prices and
   financial contracts on these agreements are deferred and recognized as
   increases or decreases in the cost of gas at the time the storage gas is
   sold.  At December 31, 1995 and 1994, the commodity swap agreements
   outstanding were immaterial.  

   NOTE 9.  FAIR VALUE OF FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS

            In accordance with SFAS No. 107, "Disclosure about Fair Value of
   Financial Instruments," all financial instruments of the Company for which
   the carrying amount does not approximate fair value, must be disclosed. 
   At December 31, 1995, the fair value of long-term debt was $408.4 million
   and the carrying amount was $375.6 million.  At  December 31, 1994, the
   fair value of long-term debt was $385.1 million and the carrying amount
   was $393.5 million.  


   NOTE 10. CAPITALIZATION:

   a.       Common Shareowner's Investment:

            A retail rate order effective January 1, 1995, requires WP&L to
   maintain a utility common equity level of 51.93 percent of total utility
   capitalization during the test years January 1, 1995 to December 31, 1996. 
   In addition, the PSCW ordered that it must approve the payment of
   dividends by WP&L to WPLH that are in excess of the level forecasted in
   the rate order  ($58.1 million), if such dividends would reduce WP&L's
   average common equity ratio below 51.93 percent.  At December 31, 1995,
   WP&L's common equity ratio was 52.6 percent.

   b.       Long-term Debt:

            Substantially all of WP&L's utility plant is secured by its
   first mortgage bonds.  Current maturities of long-term debt are as
   follows: $0 in 1996, $55 million in 1997, $8.9 million in 1998, $0 in 1999
   and $1.9 million in 2000.

            On September 14, 1995, the Company received an order from the
   PSCW authorizing the sale of up to $60 million of long-term debt
   securities.  The Company currently expects to make an offering of the
   long-term debt securities before December 31, 1996, unless the PSCW grants
   a request for extension.  The Company intends to use the net proceeds from
   the sale of these securities first to repay short-term debt which was
   incurred in June 1995 to repurchase in private transactions $18 million
   aggregate principal amount of the Company's 9.30 percent first mortgage
   bonds, Series V, due December 1, 2025.  The remainder of the net proceeds
   will be used to repay other short-term debt incurred by the Company to
   finance utility construction expenditures and for general corporate
   purposes.

   NOTE 11. COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES:

   a.        Coal Contract Commitments:

            To ensure an adequate supply of coal, WP&L has entered into
   certain long-term coal contracts.  These contracts include a demand or
   take-or-pay clause under which payments are required if contracted
   quantities are not purchased.  Purchase obligations on these coal and
   related rail contracts total approximately $168 million through December
   31, 2002.  WP&L's management believes it will meet minimum coal and rail
   purchase obligations under the contracts.  Minimum purchase obligations on
   these contracts over the next five years are estimated to be $37 million
   in 1996, 1997, and 1998, $30 million in 1999 and $10 million in 2000.

   b.        Purchased Power and Gas:

             Under firm purchased power and gas contracts, WP&L is obligated
   as follows (dollars in millions):

                    Purchased Power           Purchased Gas
                  Purchase               Purchase     Dekatherms
                 Obligation      MW's   Obligation  (in millions)

    1996            $23.4     2,893         $73              94
    1997             14.1     4,212          62              82
    1998             17.7     4,041          52              69
    1999             19.8     4,050          43              54
    2000             27.7     4,796          39              52
    Thereafter      104.6    11,510         108             163


   c.        Manufactured Gas Plant Sites:

             Historically, WP&L has owned 11 properties that have been
   associated with the production of manufactured gas.  Currently, WP&L owns
   five of these sites, three are owned by municipalities, and the remaining
   three are owned by private companies.  In 1989, WP&L initiated
   investigation of these manufactured gas plant sites.  The Wisconsin
   Department of Natural Resources ("DNR") has been involved in reviewing
   investigation plans and has received ongoing reports regarding these
   investigations.

             WP&L has continued its investigations and studies.  WP&L
   confirmed that there was no contamination at two of the sites and has now
   received a close out letter from the DNR related to each  of those sites. 
   Additionally, the investigation of historical records at a third site
   indicated a minimal likelihood of any significant environmental impacts. 
   In 1995, WP&L requested and received a close out letter for the third
   site.

             In February 1993, WP&L completed cost estimated for the
   environmental remediation of the eight remaining sites.  The result of
   this analysis indicate that during the next 32 years, WP&L will expend
   approximately $77 million for feasibility studies, data collection, soil
   remediation activities, groundwater research and groundwater remediation
   activities, including construction of slurry containment walls and the
   installation of groundwater pump and treatment facilitates.  This estimate
   was based on various assumptions, and is subject to continuous review and
   revision by management.

             The cost estimate set forth above assumes 4 percent average
   inflation over the period.  The cost estimate also contemplates that
   primarily groundwater pump and treatment activities will take place after
   1998 through and including 2027.  During this time, WP&L estimates that it
   will incur average annual costs of $2 million to complete the planned
   groundwater remediation activities.

             Through 1995, management has continued its oversight of the
   issues related to the above manufactured gas plant sites without
   significant revision to the above estimates and assumptions.  With respect
   to rate recovery of these costs, the PSCW has approved a five-year
   amortization of the unamortized balance of environmental costs expended to
   date.  Based on the present regulatory record at the PSCW, management
   believes that future costs of remediating these manufactured gas plant
   sites will be recovered in rates.  

   d.        Spent Nuclear Fuel and Decommissioning Costs:

             Wisconsin utilities with ownership of nuclear generating plants
   are required by the PSCW to establish and make annual contributions to
   external trust funds to provide for plant decommissioning over the
   remaining life of the Kewaunee Nuclear Power Plant ("Kewaunee").  In July
   1994, the PSCW issued a generic order covering utilities that have nuclear
   generation, which standardizes the escalation assumptions to be used in
   determining nuclear decommissioning liabilities.

             WP&L's share of the decommissioning costs of Kewaunee is
   estimated to be $169 million (in 1995 dollars, assuming the plant is
   operating through 2013) based on a 1992 site-specific study, using the
   immediate dismantlement method of decommissioning.  The costs of
   decommissioning are assumed to escalate at an annual rate of 6.5 percent. 
   The undiscounted amount of decommissioning costs estimated to be expended
   between the years 2014 and 2050 is $1,016 million.

             WP&L has established external trusts to custody decommissioning
   funds.  The Company's current annual contribution is $10.7 million.  This
   amount is fully recovered in rates.  The after-tax income of the external
   trust funds was $2.8 million, $2.7 million and $1.1 million for the years
   ended December 31, 1995, 1994 and 1993, respectively.  In accordance with
   SFAS No. 115, "Accounting for Certain Investments in Debt and Equity
   Securities," the fair value of the external trusts as of December 31, 1995
   and 1994, is reported as $73.4 million and $51.8 million, respectively.

             Decommissioning costs, which include the annual contribution 
   and earnings on the assets of the trust, are recorded as depreciation
   expense in the Consolidated Statements of Income with the cumulative
   amount included in the accumulated provision for depreciation on the
   Consolidated Balance Sheets.  Depreciation expense related to Kewaunee
   totaled $13.6 million, $13.4 million and $6.1 million in 1995, 1994 and
   1993, respectively.  As of December 31, 1995, the total decommissioning
   costs included in the accumulated provision for depreciation were $73.4
   million.

             Under the Nuclear Waste Policy Act of 1982, the U.S. Department
   of Energy ("DOE") is responsible for the ultimate storage and disposal of
   spent nuclear fuel removed from nuclear reactors.  Interim storage space
   for spent nuclear fuel is currently provided at Kewaunee.  Currently there
   is on-site storage capacity for spent fuel through the year 2001.  An
   investment of approximately $2.5 million could provide additional storage
   sufficient to meet spent fuel storage needs until the expiration of the
   current operating license.   The following summarizes the investment at
   December 31, 1995 and 1994:

                                    1995             1994
      Original cost of

                                 =======          =======

   e.         Nuclear Insurance:

             The Price Anderson Act provides for the payment of funds for
   public liability claims arising from a nuclear incident.  Accordingly, in
   the event of a nuclear incident, WP&L, as a 41-percent owner of Kewaunee,
   is subject to an overall assessment of approximately $32.5 million per
   incident for its ownership of this factor, not to exceed $4.1 million
   payable in any given year.

             Through its membership in Nuclear Electric Insurance Limited,
   WP&L has obtained property damage and decontamination insurance totaling
   $1.5 billion for loss from damage at Kewaunee.  In addition, WP&L
   maintains outage and replacement power insurance coverage totaling $101.4
   million in the event an outage exceeds 21 weeks.

   f.        Planned Capital Expenditures:

             Plans for the construction and financing of future additions to
   utility plant can be found elsewhere in this report in "Management's
   Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations."

   NOTE 12.  PROPOSED MERGER OF THE COMPANY:

             WPL Holdings, Inc. ("WPLH"), IES Industries Inc. ("IES"), and
   Interstate Power Company ("IPC") have entered into an Agreement and Plan
   of Merger ("Merger Agreement"), dated  November 10, 1995, providing for:
   a) IPC becoming a wholly-owned subsidiary of WPLH, and b) the merger of
   IES with and into WPLH, which merger will result in the combination of IES
   and WPLH as a single holding company (collectively, the "Proposed
   Merger").  The new holding company will be named Interstate Energy
   Corporation ("Interstate Energy").  The Proposed Merger, which will be
   accounted for as a pooling of interests, has been approved by the
   respective Boards of Directors.  It is still subject to approval by the
   shareholders of each company as well as several federal and state
   regulatory agencies.  The companies expect to receive the shareholder
   approvals in the second quarter of 1996 and the regulatory approvals by
   the second quarter of 1997.  

   The operating revenues, net income from continuing operations and total
   assets of the companies were as follows:

                                                                 PRO FORMA
                                                                 COMBINED
                                WPLH         IES        IPC     (Unaudited)

    1995 Operating revenues   $807,255     $851,010  $318,542   $1,976,807
    1995 Income from
      continuing operations    $71,618      $64,176   $25,198     $160,992
    Assets at December 31,
      1995                  $1,872,414   $1,985,591  $634,316   $4,492,321


             Under the terms of the Merger Agreement, the outstanding shares
   of WPLH's common stock will remain unchanged and outstanding as shares of
   Interstate Energy.  Each outstanding share of IES common stock will be
   converted to .98 shares of Interstate Energy's common stock.  Each share
   of IPC's common stock will be converted to 1.11 shares of Interstate
   Energy's common stock.  It is anticipated that Interstate Energy will
   retain WPLH's common share dividend payment level as of the effective time
   of the merger.  On January 24, 1996, the Board of Directors of WPLH
   declared a quarterly dividend of 49.25 cents per share.  This represents
   an annual rate of $1.97 per share.

             IES is a holding company headquartered in Cedar Rapids, Iowa,
   and is the parent company of IES Utilities Inc. ("IES Utilities") and IES
   Diversified Inc. ("IES Diversified").  IES Utilities supplies electric and
   gas service to approximately 333,000 and 174,000 customers, respectively,
   in Iowa.  IES Diversified and its principal subsidiaries are primarily
   engaged in the energy-related, transportation and real estate development
   businesses.  IPC, an operating public utility headquartered in Dubuque,
   Iowa, supplies electric and gas service to approximately 163,000 and
   49,000 customers, respectively, in northeast Iowa, northwest Illinois and
   southern Minnesota. 

             Interstate Energy will be the parent company of  WP&L, IES
   Utilities and  IPC and will be registered under the Public Utility Holding
   Company Act of 1935, as amended ("1935 Act").  The Merger Agreement
   provides that these operating utility companies will continue to operate
   as separate entities for a minimum of three years beyond the effective
   date of the merger.  In addition, the non-utility operations of WPLH and
   IES Diversified will be combined shortly after the effective date of  the
   merger under one entity to manage the diversified operations of Interstate
   Energy.  The corporate headquarters of Interstate Energy will be in
   Madison.

             The SEC historically has interpreted the 1935 Act to preclude
   registered holding companies, with limited exceptions, from owning both
   electric and gas utility systems.  Although the SEC has recently
   recommended that registered holding companies be allowed to hold both gas
   and electric utility operations if the affected states agree, it remains
   possible that the SEC may require as a condition to its approval of the
   Proposed Merger that WPLH, IES and IPC divest their gas utility
   properties, and possibly certain non-utility ventures of WPLH and IES,
   within a reasonable time after the effective date of the Proposed Merger.

   the consolidated financial statements included in the 1995 Form 10-K of
   Wisconsin Power and Light Company and have issued our report thereon dated

   provided in Paragraph 5 of Section 2 of this Article.  All deposits in any

        2.  No debts shall be contracted except for current expenses unless
            authorized by the Board of Directors or the Executive Committee,
            and no invoices shall be paid by the Treasurer unless audited and

        3.  Checks, drafts and notes drawn on any account or deposit of the

            instruments signed in this manner provided the facsimile

            Secretary or other duly authorized Officer of the Company.

        5.  In addition to the provisions of Section 1 of this Article VII,
            the Treasurer of the Company is authorized to establish petty
            cash funds, on an imprest basis.  Each such account shall be
            designated as a "Cashier's Trust Account" and shall be separately
            maintained and accounted for by the cashier or other employee
            assigned such responsibility by the Treasurer.

            a.  Checks drawn on a Cashier's Trust Account may be signed and
                countersigned on behalf of the Company by such employees as
                the Treasurer or Vice President-Finance may from time to time
                authorize and designate; provided, however, that no such
                check shall be signed and countersigned by the same person.

            b.  No payment out of petty cash funds, whether by cash or check,
                shall exceed $2,500 in the case of payments by district
                offices, area offices or the Treasury Department, or $1,000

                manual or facsimile signature of its Chief Executive Officer
                or President and shall not require any countersignature.

                Company from claims for personal injury and/or property
                damage.

            b.  Any employee or agent authorized by the treasurer of the
                Company may draw such sight drafts in amounts not exceeding
                $10,000 payable to any one person or in any transaction for
                right-of-way easements, reimbursements for damages to land,
                payments to bind agreements for purchases of real estate and
                payments of document recording fees.

   authorized in writing by any of the foregoing Officers, is authorized to
   direct any depository:

            the issuance of a check or draft of the Company, for the purpose
            of paying principal of and interest on bonds and notes issued by
            the Company, and

        2.  to accept and process data submitted via electronic means or by
            wire transfer for purposes of receipt or disbursement of funds;

   provided that such direction is in writing and describes the type of such
   transactions permitted to be made by such depository.

        Section 2 - Mandatory Indemnification -

         1.     The Corporation shall indemnify a Director or Officer, to the
                extent he or she has been successful on the merits or
                otherwise in the defense of a proceeding, for all reasonable
                expenses incurred in the proceeding if the Director or
                Officer was a party because he or she is a Director or
                Officer of the Corporation.

        2.  a.  In cases not included under sub. 1., the Corporation shall
                indemnify a Director or Officer against liability incurred by
                the Director or Officer in a proceeding to which the Director
                or Officer was a party because he or she is a Director or
                Officer of the Corporation, unless liability was incurred
                because the Director or Officer breached or failed to perform
                a duty he or she owes to the Corporation and the breach or
                failure to perform constitutes any of the following:

                1) A willful failure to deal fairly with the Corporation or
                   its shareholders in connection with a matter in which the
                   Director or Officer has a material conflict of interest.

                2) A violation of criminal law, unless the Director or
                   Officer had reasonable cause to believe his or her
                   conduct was lawful or no reasonable cause to believe his
                   or her conduct was unlawful.

                3) A transaction from which the Director or Officer derived
                   an improper personal profit.

                4) Willful misconduct.

            b.  Determination of whether indemnification is required under
                this subsection shall be made under Section 3.

            c.  The termination of a proceeding by judgment, order,
                settlement or conviction, or upon a plea of no contest or an
                equivalent plea, does not, by itself, create a presumption
                that indemnification of the Director or Officer is not
                required under this subsection.

        3.  A Director or Officer who seeks indemnification under this
            section shall make a written request to the Corporation.

        4.  a.  Indemnification under this Article X is not required to the
                extent limited by the articles of incorporation under
                Section 180.048, Wis. Stats.

            b.  Indemnification under this Article X is not required if the
                Director or Officer has previously received indemnification
                or allowance of expenses from any person, including the
                Corporation, in connection with the same proceeding.

        Section 3 - Determination of Right to Indemnification - Unless
   otherwise provided by the articles of incorporation or bylaws or by
   written agreement between the Director or Officer and the Corporation, the
   Director or Officer seeks indemnification under Section 2, 2. shall select
   one of the following means for determining his or her right to
   indemnification:

        1.  By a majority vote of a quorum of the Board of Directors
            consisting of Directors not at the time parties to the same or
            related proceedings.  If a quorum of disinterested Directors
            cannot be obtained, by majority vote of a committee duly
            appointed by the Board of Directors and consisting solely of 2 or
            more Directors not at the time parties to the same or related
            proceedings.  Directors who are parties to the same or related
            proceedings may participate in the designation of members of the
            committee.

        2.  By independent legal counsel selected by a quorum of the Board of
            Directors or its committee in the manner prescribed in 1., above,
            if unable to obtain such a quorum or committee, by a majority
            vote of the full Board of Directors, including Directors who are
            parties to the same or related proceedings.

        3.  By a panel of three arbitrators consisting of one arbitrator
            selected by those Directors entitled under 2., above, to select
            independent legal counsel, one arbitrator selected by the
            Director or Officer seeking indemnification and one arbitrator
            selected by the two arbitrators previously selected.

        4.  By an affirmative vote of shares as provided in Section 180.28,
            Wis. Stats., shares owned by, or voted under the control of,
            persons who are at the time parties to the same or related
            proceedings, whether as plaintiffs or defendants or in any other
            capacity, may not be voted in making the determination.

        5.  By a court under Section 180.051, Wis. Stats., as created by 1987
            Wisconsin Act 13.

        6.  By any other method provided for in any additional right to
            indemnification permitted under Section 5, below.

        Section 4 - Allowance of Expenses as Incurred - Upon written request
   by a Director or Officer who is a party to a proceeding, the Corporation
   may pay or reimburse his or her reasonable expenses as incurred if the
   Director or Officer provides the Corporation with all of the following:

        1.  A written affirmation of his or her good faith belief that he or
            she has not breached or failed to perform his or her duties to
            the Corporation.

        2.  A written undertaking, executed personally or on his or her
            behalf, to repay the allowance and/if required by the
            Corporation, to pay reasonable interest on the allowance to the
            extent that it is ultimately determined under Section 3, above,
            that indemnification under Section 2, above, is not required and
            that indemnification is not ordered by a court.  The undertaking
            under this subsection shall be an unlimited general obligation of
            the Director or Officer and may be accepted without reference to
            his or her ability to repay the allowance.  The undertaking may
            be secured or unsecured.

        Section 5 - Additional Rights to Indemnification and Allowance of
   Expenses  

        1.  Except as provided in 2. below, Sections 2 and 4 above, do not
            preclude any additional right to indemnification or allowance of
            expenses that a Director or Officer may have under any of the
            following:

            a.  The articles of incorporation or bylaws.

            b.  A written agreement between the Director or Officer and the
                Corporation.

            c.  A resolution of the Board of Directors.

            d.  A resolution, after notice, adopted by a majority vote of all
                the Corporation's voting shares then issued and outstanding.

        2.  Regardless of the existence of an additional right under
            subsection 1., above, the Corporation may not indemnify a
            Director or Officer, or permit a Director or Officer to retain
            any allowance of expenses unless it is determined by or on behalf
            of the Corporation that the Director or Officer did not breach or
            fail to perform a duty he or she owes to the Corporation which
            constitutes conduct under Section 2, 2. a. 1), 2), 3) or 4).  A
            Director or Officer who is a party to the same or related
            proceeding for which indemnification or an allowance of expenses
            is sought may not participate in a determination under this
            subsection.

        3.  No provision of this Article X shall affect the Corporation's
            power to pay or reimburse expenses incurred by a Director or
            Officer in any of the following circumstances:

            a.  As a witness in a proceeding to which he or she is not a
                party.

            b.  As a plaintiff or petitioner in a proceeding because he or
                she is or was an employee, agent, Director or Officer of the
                Corporation.

        Section 6 - Insurance - The Corporation may purchase and maintain
   insurance on behalf of an individual who is an employee, agent, Director
   or Officer of the Corporation against liability asserted against or
   incurred by the individual in his or her capacity as an employee, agent,
   Director or Officer or arising from his or her status as an employee,
   agent, Director or Officer, regardless of whether the Corporation is
   required or authorized to indemnify or allow expenses to the individual
   against the same liability under Sections 2, 3, 4 or 5 of this Article X.

        Section 7 - Indemnification and Insurance Against Securities
   Law Claims - Sections 1 through 6, inclusive, apply to the extent
   applicable to any other proceeding, to any proceeding involving a federal
   or state statute, rule or regulation regulating the offer, sale or
   purchase of securities, securities brokers or dealers, or investment
   companies or investment advisers.

        Section 8 - Reliance by Directors or Officers -

        1.  Unless the Director or Officer has knowledge that makes reliance
            unwarranted, a Director or Officer, in discharging his or her
            duties to the Corporation, may rely on information, opinions,
            reports or statements, any of which may be written or oral,
            formal or informal, including financial statements and other
            financial data, if prepared or presented by any of the following:

            a.  An Officer or employee of the Corporation whom the Director
                or Officer believes in good faith to be reliable and
                competent in the matters presented.

            b.  Legal counsel, public accountants or other persons as to
                matters the Director or Officer believes in good faith are
                within the person's professional or expert competence.

            c.  In the case of reliance by a Director, a committee of the
                Board of Directors of which the Director is not a member if
                the Director believes in good faith that the committee merits
                confidence.

        2.  This section does not apply to a Director's reliance under
            Section 180.40(3), Wis. Stats., as in effect on the date of
            adoption hereof.

        Section 9 - Consideration of Interests in Addition to Shareholders'
   Interests - In discharging his or her duties to the Corporation and in
   determining what he or she believes to be in the best interests of the
   Corporation, a Director or Officer may, in addition to considering the
   effects of any action on shareholders, consider the following:

        1.  The effects of the action on employees, suppliers and customers
            of the Corporation.
