   ITEM 11.   EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION

                            COMPENSATION OF DIRECTORS

        No fees are paid to directors who are officers of the Company and/or
   its parent or any of its subsidiaries (presently Mr. Davis). 
   Nonmanagement directors, each of whom serve on the Boards of the Company,
   WPLH, and Heartland Development Corporation, receive an annual retainer of
   $32,800 for service on all three boards.  Travel expenses are paid for
   each meeting day attended.  All nonmanagement directors also received a
   25 percent matching contribution in WPLH common stock for limited optional
   cash purchases, up to $10,000, of WPLH common stock through the WPLH
   Dividend Reinvestment and Stock Purchase Plan.  Matching contributions of
   $2,500 each for calendar year 1995 were made for the following directors: 
   L. Aspin, L. D. Carley, R. G. Flowers, D. R. Haldeman, K. C. Lyall, A. M.
   Nemirow, M. E. Neshek, H. C. Prange, J. D. Pyle, H. F. Scheig and C. T.
   Toussaint.  Mr. Scheig retired as a director effective May 17, 1995.  Mr.
   Aspin passed away on May 21, 1995.

        Director's Charitable Award Program - A Director's Charitable Award
   Program is maintained for the nonmanagement members of the Company's Board
   of Directors beginning after three years of service.  The purpose of the
   Program is to recognize the interest of the Company and its directors in
   supporting worthy institutions, and enhance the Company's director benefit
   program so that the Company is able to continue to attract and retain
   directors of the highest caliber.  Under the Program, when a director
   dies, a total of $500,000 will be donated by the Company and/or WPLH to
   one qualified charitable organization, or that amount will be divided
   among a maximum of four qualified charitable organizations, selected by
   the individual director.  The individual director derives no financial
   benefit from the Program.  All deductions for charitable contributions are
   taken by the Company and WPLH, and the donations are funded through life
   insurance policies on the directors.  Over the life of the Program, all
   costs of donations and premiums on the life insurance policies, including
   a return of the Company's cost of funds, will be recovered through life
   insurance proceeds on the directors.  The Program, over its life, will not
   result in any material cost to the Company.

        Director's Life Insurance Program - The Company maintains a split-
   dollar Director's Life Insurance Program for nonemployee directors,
   beginning after three years of service,  which provides a maximum death
   benefit of $500,000 to each eligible director.  Under the split-dollar
   arrangement, directors are provided a death benefit only and do not have
   any interest in the cash value of the policies.  The Life Insurance
   Program is structured to pay a portion of the total death benefit to the
   Company to reimburse the Company for all costs of the program, including a
   return on its funds.  The Life Insurance Program, over its life, will not
   result in any material cost to the Company.

                       COMPENSATION OF EXECUTIVE OFFICERS

   compensation paid by the Company for all services rendered during 1995,

   1    Consists of non-qualified stock options to purchase shares of WPLH
        common stock granted pursuant to the WPLH Long-Term Equity Incentive
        Plan.  Options were granted on January 3, 1995, and will fully vest
        on January 3, 1998.  These options were granted with an equal number
        of contingent dividend awards as described in the table entitled
        "Long-Term Incentive Awards in 1995", and have exercise prices equal
        to the fair market value of a share of WPLH common stock on the date
        of grant.  Upon a "change in control" of WPLH as defined in the Long-
        Term Equity Incentive Plan or upon retirement, disability or death of
        the option holder, these options shall become immediately
        exercisable.  Upon exercise of an option, the executive purchases all
        or a portion of the shares covered by the option by paying the
        exercise price multiplied by the number of shares as to which the
        option is exercised, either in cash or by surrendering shares of WPLH
        common stock already owned by the executive.

   2    The hypothetical potential appreciation shown for the named
        executives is required by rules of the Securities and Exchange
        Commission.  The amounts shown do not represent either the historical
        or expected future performance of WPLH's common stock.  For example,
        in order for the named executives to realize the potential values set
        forth in the 5% and 10% columns in the table above, the price per
        share of WPLH common stock would be $44.80 and $71.34, respectively,
        as of the expiration date of the options.

   1 Consists of performance units awarded under the WPLH Long-Term Equity
     Incentive Plan in combination with stock options (as described in the
     table entitled "Option/SAR Grants in 1995").  These performance units
     are entirely in the form of contingent dividends and will be paid if
     total shareholder return over a three year period ending January 3,
     1998 equals or exceeds the median return earned by the companies in a
     peer group of utility holding companies, except that there will be no
     payment if WPLH's total return is negative over the course of such
     period.  If payable, each participant shall receive an amount equal to
     the accumulated dividends paid on one share of WPLH common stock during
     the period of January 3, 1995 through January 2, 1998 multiplied by the
     number of performance units awarded to the participant, and modified by
     a performance multiplier which ranges from 0 to 1.75 based on the WPLH
     total return relative to the peer group.

   2 Assumes, for purposes of illustration only, a 2 cent per share increase
     in the annual dividend on shares of WPLH common stock for 1996 and
     1997.

   Agreements with Executives

        WPLH, the parent of the Company, has entered into employment and
   severance agreements with certain executive officers of the Company,
   including Messrs. Davis, Harvey, Protsch, Amato, and Doyle. WPLH
   recognized that, in today's developing competitive marketplace within the
   energy industry, circumstances may arise in which a change of control of
   WPLH may occur, through acquisition or otherwise.   This potentiality may
   cause uncertainty about the continued employment  of certain key
   executives with the Company, without regard to the competence or past
   contributions of the executives.  WPLH recognized further that this
   uncertainty could result in the loss to the Company and WPLH of valuable
   services of one or more of the key executives, particularly during a
   period where these same executives may be called upon to negotiate on
   behalf of the shareowners.  Because of the intimate knowledge of the
   business and the affairs of the Company which these executives possess,
   such loss could be to the detriment of the Company and WPLH.  To provide
   the Company, WPLH and key executives reasonable security against changes
   in the relationship of the executives with the Company and WPLH in the
   event of a change in control, WPLH entered into the employment and
   severance agreements.  The agreements provide that each executive officer
   covered by the agreements is entitled to benefits if, within five years
   after a change in control of WPLH (as defined in the agreements), the
   officer's employment is ended through (i) termination by the Company,
   other than by reason of death or disability or for cause (as defined in
   the agreements), or (ii) termination by the officer due to a breach of the
   agreement by WPLH or the Company or a significant change in the officer's
   responsibilities, or (iii) in the case of Mr Davis' agreement only,
   termination by Mr. Davis following the first anniversary of the change of
   control.  The benefits provided under each agreement are: (i) a cash
   termination payment of one, two or three times (depending on which
   executive is involved) the sum of the executive officer's annual salary
   and his average annual bonus during the three years before the termination
   and (ii) continuation for up to five years of equivalent hospital,
   medical, dental, accident, disability and life insurance coverage as in
   effect at the time of termination.  The agreements also provide the
   foregoing benefits in connection with certain terminations which are
   effected in anticipation of a change of control.  Each agreement provides
   that if any portion of the benefits under the agreement or under any other
   agreement for the officer would constitute an excess payment for purposes
   of the Internal Revenue Code, benefits will be reduced so that the officer
   will be entitled to receive $1 less than the maximum amount which he could
   receive without becoming subject to the 20% excise tax imposed by the Code
   on certain excess payments as defined in the Code, or which WPLH may pay
   without loss of deduction under the Code.  The Board of Directors of WPLH
   has authorized that each of the foregoing agreements be amended to
   specifically provide that the consummation of the proposed combination
   involving WPLH, IES Industries Inc. and Interstate Power Company will
   constitute a change of control in certain cases for purposes of the
   agreements in the event of a termination without cause.

   Retirement and Employee Benefit Plans

        Salaried employees (including officers) of the  Company are eligible
   to participate in the Company's Retirement Plan.  All eligible persons
   whose compensation is reported in the foregoing Summary Compensation Table
   participated in the plan during 1995.  Contributions to the plan are
   determined actuarially, computed on a single-life, annuity basis, and
   cannot be readily calculated as applied to any individual participant or
   small group of participants.  For purposes of the plan, compensation means
   payment for services rendered, including vacation and sick pay, and is
   substantially equivalent to salary reported in the foregoing Summary
   Compensation Table.  Retirement Plan benefits depend upon length of plan
   service (up to a maximum of 30 years), age at retirement, and amount of
   compensation (determined in accordance with the plan) and are reduced by
   up to 50 percent of Social Security benefits.  Credited years of service
   under the plan for covered persons named in the foregoing Summary
   Compensation Table are as follows:  Erroll B. Davis, Jr., 16 years;
   William D. Harvey, 8 years; Eliot G. Protsch, 16 years; A. J. (Nino)

   *  Average annual compensation is based upon the average of the highest 36
   consecutive months of compensation.  The Retirement Plan benefits shown
   above are net of estimated Social Security benefits and do not reflect any
   deductions for other amounts.  The annual retirement benefits payable are
   subject to certain maximum limitations (in general, $120,000 for 1995 and
   $120,000 for 1996) under the Internal Revenue Code.  Under the Retirement
   Plan and a supplemental survivors income plan, if a Retirement Plan
   participant dies prior to retirement, the designated survivor of the
   participant is entitled to a monthly income benefit equal to approximately
   50 percent (100 percent in the case of certain executive officers and key
   management employees) of the monthly retirement benefit which would have
   been payable to the participant under the Retirement Plan if the
   participant had remained employed by the Company until eligible for normal
   retirement.

        Unfunded Supplemental Retirement Plan - The Company maintains an
   Unfunded Supplemental Retirement Plan which provides funds for payment of
   retirement benefits above the limitations on payments from qualified
   pension plans in those cases where an employee's retirement benefits
   exceed the qualified plan limits.  Additionally, the plan provides for
   payments of supplemental retirement benefits to employees holding the
   title of Vice President or higher, who have been granted additional months
   of service by the Board of Directors for purposes of computing retirement
   benefits.

        Unfunded Executive Tenure Plan - The Company maintains an Unfunded
   Executive Tenure Plan to provide incentive for key executives to remain in
   the service of the Company by providing additional compensation which is
   payable only if the executive remains with the Company until retirement
   (or other termination if approved by the Board of Directors). 
   Participants in the plan must be designated by the Chief Executive Officer
   and approved by the Board.  Mr. Davis was the only active participant in
   the plan as of December 31, 1995.  The plan provides for monthly payments
   to a participant after retirement (at or after age 65, or with Board
   approval, prior to age 65) for 120 months.  The payments will be equal to
   25 percent of the participant's highest average salary for any consecutive
   36-month period.  If a participant dies prior to retirement or before 120
   payments have been made, the participant's beneficiary will receive
   monthly payments equal to 50 percent of such amount for 120 months in the
   case of death before retirement, or if the participant dies after
   retirement, 50 percent of such amount for the balance of the 120 months. 
   Annual benefits of $104,500 would be payable to Mr. Davis upon retirement,
   assuming he continues in the Company's service until retirement at the
   same salary as was in effect on December 31, 1995.
