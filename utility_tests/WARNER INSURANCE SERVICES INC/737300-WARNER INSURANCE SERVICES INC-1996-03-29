     -------------------------------------------------------------------------

                              PART III--NARRATIVE

     -------------------------------------------------------------------------

     State below in reasonable detail the reasons why Form 10-K, 20-F, 11-K, 10-
     Q, N-SAR, or the transition report or portion thereof could not be filed
     within the prescribed period.

          On March 4, 1996, Warner Insurance Services, Inc. (the "Registrant")
     announced a series of agreements relating to its former Insurance Services
     Division ("ISD") which resulted in the settlement and dismissal of lawsuits
     with certain affiliates of The Robert Plan Corporation and the release of
     the Registrant from continuing obligations under certain contracts for the
     provision of insurance services to ISD customers.  As a part of the
     restructuring (the "Restructuring"), the Registrant transferred a
     predominant part of its ISD assets to MDA Services, Inc., a subsidiary of
     The Robert Plan Corporation, which has succeeded the Registrant as the
     servicing processor for the ISD customers.  Because the Restructuring has
     impacted upon the Registrant's consolidated financial statements for the
     fiscal year ended December 31,1995, and because such impact is still in the
     process of being analyzed and finalized, the Registrant is unable to
     complete the Annual Report on Form 10-K, containing the consolidated
     financial statements of the Registrant, by March 31, 1996 without
     unreasonable effort or expense.  The Registrant fully expects to complete
     the analysis of the Restructuring necessary to finalize the preparation of
     the Registrant's consolidated financial statements for the 1995 fiscal year
     such that the Registrant will be in a position to file the Form 10-K on or
     before the fifteenth calendar day following the prescribed due date for the
     Form 10-K.


     -------------------------------------------------------------------------
     
                              PART IV--OTHER INFORMATION

     -------------------------------------------------------------------------
     
          (1) Name and telephone number of person to contact in regard to this
     notification:

               Raul F. Calvo                 (201)     794-4800
     .........................................................................
                 (Name)                 (Area Code) (Telephone Number)

          (2) Have all other periodic reports required under Section 13 or 15(d)
     of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 or Section 30 of the Investment
     Company Act of 1940 during the preceding 12 months or for such shorter
     period that the registrant was required to file such report(s) been filed?
     If the answer is no, identify report(s).
                                                       [X] Yes         [ ] No

          (3) Is it anticipated that any significant change in results of
     operations from the corresponding period for the last fiscal year will be
     reflected by the earnings statements to be included in the subject report
     or portion thereof?
                                                       [X] Yes         [ ] No

          If so:  provide an explanation of the anticipated change, both
     narratively and quantitatively, and, if appropriate, state the reasons why
     a reasonable estimate of the results cannot be made.

          It is anticipated that the results of operations for the three months
     ended December 31, 1995 will include a net operating loss in excess of $2
     million compared with net operating loss of approximately $11.3 million for
     the same period of 1994.  The net operating loss for the fiscal year ended
     December 31, 1995 is anticipated to be approximately $11 million compared
     with a net operating loss of approximately $14 million for the fiscal year
     ended December 31, 1994.  The anticipated losses for the three months and
     fiscal year ended December 31, 1995 arose from losses in the Registrant's
     ISD business which was transferred during the first quarter of 1996 to a
     subsidiary of The Robert Plan Corporation.  The Registrant's wholly-owned
     subsidiary, COVER-ALL Systems, Inc. anticipates a net loss of $3.5 million
     for the fiscal year ended December 31, 1995 compared with a net loss of
     approximately $7 million for the same period in 1994.
