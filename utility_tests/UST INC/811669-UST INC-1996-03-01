                                     PART I
 
ITEM 1 -- BUSINESS
 
GENERAL
 
     UST Inc. was formed on December 23, 1986 as a Delaware corporation.
Pursuant to a reorganization approved by stockholders at the 1987 Annual
Meeting, United States Tobacco Company (originally incorporated in 1911) became
a wholly owned subsidiary of UST Inc. on May 5, 1987. UST Inc., through its
subsidiaries (collectively "Registrant" unless the context otherwise requires),
is engaged in manufacturing and marketing consumer products in the following
industry segments:
 
          Tobacco Products: Registrant's primary activities are manufacturing
     and marketing smokeless tobacco (snuff and chewing tobacco) and other
     tobacco products.
 
          Wine: Registrant produces and markets wine.
 
          Other: The international and video entertainment operations as well as
     certain miscellaneous businesses are included in this segment. Registrant
     also produces or imports and markets certain other products such as
     smokers' accessories and operates certain commercial agricultural
     properties.
 
INDUSTRY SEGMENT DATA
 
     Registrant hereby incorporates by reference the Consolidated Industry
Segment Data pertaining to the years 1993 through 1995 set forth on page 31 of
its Annual Report to stockholders for the fiscal year ended December 31, 1995
("Annual Report"), which page is included in Exhibit 13.
 
                                        1
<PAGE>   3
 
                                TOBACCO PRODUCTS
 
PRINCIPAL PRODUCTS
 
     Registrant's principal smokeless tobacco products and brand names are as
follows:
 
          Moist -- COPENHAGEN, SKOAL LONG CUT, SKOAL, SKOAL BANDITS,
                   SKOAL FLAVOR PACKS
 
            Dry -- BRUTON, CC, RED SEAL
 
        Chewing -- WB CUT
 
     It has been claimed that the use of tobacco products may be harmful to
health. To the best of Registrant's knowledge, unresolved controversy continues
to exist among scientists concerning the claims made about tobacco and health.
In 1986, federal legislation was enacted regulating smokeless tobacco products
by, inter alia, requiring health warning notices on smokeless tobacco packages
and advertising and prohibiting the advertising of smokeless tobacco products on
electronic media. A federal excise tax was imposed in 1986, which was increased
in 1991 and 1993. The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) published in the
Federal Register in 1995 a proposal to regulate tobacco products. The contents
of the proposal include unprecedented jurisdiction over the tobacco industry's
ability to market, promote and advertise its products. Also, in recent years,
other proposals have been made at the federal level for additional regulation of
tobacco products including, inter alia, the requirement of additional warning
notices, the disallowance of advertising and promotion expenses as deductions
under federal tax law, a significant increase of federal excise taxes, a ban or
further restriction of all advertising and promotion, regulation of
environmental tobacco smoke and increased regulation of the manufacturing and
marketing of tobacco products by new or existing federal agencies. Substantially
similar proposals will likely be considered in 1996. In recent years, various
state and local governments continued the regulation of tobacco products,
including, inter alia, the imposition of significantly higher taxes, sampling
and advertising bans or restrictions, regulation of environmental tobacco smoke
and anti-tobacco advertising campaigns. Additional state and local legislative
and regulatory actions will likely be considered in 1996. Registrant is unable
to assess the future effects these various actions may have on its tobacco
business.
 
RAW MATERIALS
 
     Except as noted below, raw materials essential to Registrant's business are
generally purchased in domestic markets under competitive conditions.
 
     In 1995, Registrant increased its purchases of dark fired, burley and dark
air cured tobaccos ("tobacco") primarily from domestic sources. In 1995,
purchases from foreign suppliers declined, and continued to decline as a
percentage of total tobacco purchased. Such foreign suppliers were located in
Canada, Italy and Mexico. Various factors, including a failure of domestic
tobacco production to continue to increase, may require Registrant to purchase
additional amounts of tobacco from foreign sources in order to meet future
requirements. Tobaccos used in the manufacture of smokeless tobacco products
must be processed and aged by Registrant for a period of two to four years prior
to their use.
 
     Registrant or its suppliers purchase certain flavoring components used in
Registrant's tobacco products from foreign sources.
 
     At the present time, Registrant has no reason to believe that future raw
material requirements for its tobacco products will not be satisfied. However,
the continuing availability and the cost of tobacco from both domestic and
foreign sources is dependent upon a variety of factors which cannot be
predicted, including weather, growing conditions, disease, local planting
decisions, overall market demands and other factors.
 
WORKING CAPITAL
 
     The principal portion of Registrant's operating cash requirements relates
to its need to maintain significant inventories of leaf tobacco, primarily for
manufacturing of smokeless tobacco products, and its need to age and cure
certain of these tobaccos for periods of up to four years prior to use.
 
                                        2

CUSTOMERS
 
     Registrant markets tobacco products throughout the United States
principally to chain stores and tobacco and grocery wholesalers. Approximately
32% of Registrant's gross sales of tobacco products are made to five customers,
one of which, McLane Co. Inc., a national distributor, accounts for more than
10% of Registrant's consolidated revenue. Registrant has maintained satisfactory
relationships with these customers for many years.
 
COMPETITIVE CONDITIONS
 
     The tobacco manufacturing industry in the United States is composed of at
least four domestic companies larger than Registrant and many smaller ones. The
larger companies concentrate on the manufacture and marketing of cigarettes; one
also manufactures and markets smokeless tobacco products. Registrant is a well
established and major factor in the smokeless tobacco sector of the overall
tobacco market. Consequently, Registrant competes actively with both larger and
smaller companies in the marketing of its tobacco products. Registrant's
principal methods of competition in the marketing of its tobacco products
include quality, advertising, promotion, sampling, product recognition and
distribution.
 
                                      WINE
 
     Registrant is an established producer of premium varietal and blended
wines. CHATEAU STE. MICHELLE and COLUMBIA CREST varietal table wines and DOMAINE
STE. MICHELLE sparkling wine are produced by Registrant in the state of
Washington and marketed throughout the United States. Registrant also produces
and markets two California premium wines under the labels of VILLA MT. EDEN and
CONN CREEK. Approximately 50% of Registrant's wine sales are made to ten
distributors, no one of which accounts for more than 22% of total wine sales.
Substantially all wines are sold through state-licensed distributors with whom
Registrant maintains satisfactory relationships.
 
     It has been claimed that the use of alcohol beverages may be harmful to
health. To the best of Registrant's knowledge, unresolved controversy continues
to exist among scientists concerning the claims made about alcohol beverages and
health. In 1988, federal legislation was enacted regulating alcohol beverages by
requiring health warning notices on alcohol beverages. Effective in 1991, the
federal excise tax on wine was increased from $.17 a gallon to $1.07 a gallon
for those manufacturers that produce more than 250,000 gallons a year, such as
Registrant. In recent years at the federal level, proposals were made for
additional regulation of alcohol beverages including, inter alia, an excise tax
increase, modification of the required health warning notices and the regulation
of labeling, advertising and packaging. Substantially similar proposals will
likely be considered in 1996. Also in recent years, increased regulation of
alcohol beverages by various states included, inter alia, the imposition of
higher taxes, the requirement of health warning notices and the regulation of
advertising and packaging. Additional state and local legislative and regulatory
actions affecting the marketing of alcohol beverages will likely be considered
during 1996. Registrant is unable to assess the future effects these regulatory
and other actions may have on the sale of its wines.
 
     Registrant uses grapes harvested from its own vineyards, as well as grapes
purchased from independent growers located primarily in Washington State. Grape
harvest yields experienced by Registrant and throughout Washington State in 1995
continue to be adequate to meet requirements for premium varietal wines. As in
other viticultural regions, Registrant may experience variations of yields due
to climatic conditions. Although yields will fluctuate from year to year, at the
present time, Registrant has no reason to believe that future raw material
requirements for its wine products will not be satisfied.
 
     Registrant's principal competition comes from many larger, well-established
national companies, as well as many smaller wine producers. Registrant's
principal methods of competition include quality, price, consumer and trade wine
tastings, competitive wine judging and advertising. Registrant is a minor factor
in the total nationwide business of producing wines.
 
     Registrant concentrates its marketing efforts on premium varietal table
wines and sparkling wines. The future of Registrant's wine business will be
dependent on sales, price and volume growth for premium varietal wines, the
success of new products and adequate grape harvest yields from Washington State.

                                     OTHER
 
     Included in this segment for 1995 are the international operations, video
entertainment business, pipes, smokers' accessories, agricultural properties and
a majority interest in a company that develops and markets equipment used in
film making. None of the above, singly, constitutes a material portion of
Registrant's operations.
 
                        ADDITIONAL BUSINESS INFORMATION
 
ENVIRONMENTAL REGULATIONS
 
     Registrant does not believe that compliance with federal, state and local
provisions regulating the discharge of materials into the environment or
otherwise relating to the protection of the environment will have a material
effect upon the capital expenditures, earnings or competitive position of
Registrant.
 
NUMBER OF EMPLOYEES
 
     Registrant's average number of employees during 1995 was 4,082.
 
TRADEMARKS
 
     Registrant markets consumer products under a large number of trademarks.
All of the significant trademarks either have been registered or applications
therefor are pending with the United States Patent and Trademark Office.
 
SEASONAL BUSINESS
 
     No material portion of the business of any industry segment of Registrant
is seasonal.
 
ORDERS
 
     Backlog of orders is not a material factor in any industry segment of
Registrant.

     Such principal properties in Registrant's industry segments were utilized
only in connection with Registrant's business operations. Registrant believes
that the above properties at December 31, 1995 were suitable and adequate for
the purposes for which they were used, and were operated at satisfactory levels
of capacity.
 
     All principal properties are owned in fee by Registrant.
 
ITEM 3 -- LEGAL PROCEEDINGS
 
     Registrant has been named in certain litigation against the major domestic
cigarette companies and others seeking damages alleged to be related to the
usage of cigarettes and, in certain of those complaints, "tobacco products",
some of which contain several allegations relating to smokeless tobacco
products. Each of these actions is in varying stages of pretrial activities.
 
                                        5
<PAGE>   7
 
     Registrant believes that these pending litigation matters will not result
in any material liability for a number of reasons, including the fact that
Registrant has had only limited involvement with cigarettes and Registrant's
current percentage of total tobacco industry sales is relatively small. Prior to
1986, Registrant manufactured some cigarette products which had a de minimis
market share. From May 1, 1982 to August 1, 1994, Registrant distributed a small
volume of imported cigarettes and is indemnified against claims relating to
those products.
 
     In addition, Registrant has been named in an action entitled Sontag v.
United States Tobacco Company, et al., (No. 95-6434), 14th Judicial District
Court, Parish of Calcaseiu, State of Louisiana, served on December 27, 1995.
This action is brought by an individual plaintiff and his wife against a number
of smokeless tobacco manufacturers and certain other organizations seeking
damages and other relief in connection with injuries allegedly sustained as a
result of his use of smokeless tobacco products.
 
     Registrant believes, and has been so advised by counsel handling these
cases, that it has a number of meritorious defenses to all such pending
litigation. All such cases are, and will continue to be, vigorously defended,
and Registrant believes that the ultimate outcome of all such pending litigation
will not have a material adverse effect on the consolidated financial statements
of Registrant.

RESULTS OF OPERATIONS
 
CONSOLIDATED RESULTS
 
1995 COMPARED WITH 1994
 
     Consolidated net sales rose to $1.3 billion, an 8.4 percent increase over
1994.
 
     Tobacco segment sales increased 8.9 percent and accounted for 91.6 percent
of the $102.4 million sales increase. The Wine segment also contributed to the
overall sales gain, posting a 22.7 percent increase. Other segment sales were
lower primarily due to lower sales for the entertainment business.
 
     Over the last three years, net sales have increased 27.5 percent at an
average annual rate of 8.4 percent.
 
     Cost of products sold increased 4.1 percent to $262.2 million. Cost of
products sold for the Tobacco segment was slightly higher due to higher unit
costs and increased unit volume for moist smokeless tobacco. Wine segment costs
were significantly higher due to volume gains and sales of bulk wine. Costs for
the Other segment were lower primarily due to volume declines for the
entertainment business.
 
     Gross profit increased $92.1 million or 9.5 percent over 1994 primarily due
to higher selling prices and increased unit volume for moist smokeless tobacco.
 
     The gross profit percentage rose to 80.2 percent mainly due to the
favorable results for moist smokeless tobacco. The gross profit percentage has
increased 4.9 percentage points over the last three years.
 
     Selling, advertising and administrative expenses rose 7.6 percent to $355.5
million.
 
     Selling and advertising expenses increased for all segments. Administrative
and other expenses increased slightly due to increases in salary and related
costs and higher spending associated with addressing legal and regulatory
issues. Included in administrative and other expenses in 1995 is a charge
relating to an employment contract with a former officer, and in the fourth
quarter, provisions to write-down nonstrategic assets which were partially
offset by a gain recorded on the sale of a corporate aircraft.
 
     The Company incurred net interest expense as interest expense on borrowings
exceeded income from cash equivalent investments.
 
     Pretax profit margins increased slightly to 53.2 percent on earnings before
income taxes of $704.6 million. Over the last three years, earnings before
income taxes have increased 40.2 percent at an average annual rate of 12.1
percent, while pretax margins have averaged 53.3 percent.
 
     The overall tax rate for 1995 decreased slightly.
 
     Net earnings increased for the 35th consecutive year rising 10.9 percent to
$429.8 million. Primary earnings per share rose to $2.16, a 15.5 percent
increase over 1994. Primary earnings per share have increased 53.2 percent over
the last three years at an average annual rate of 15.3 percent.
 
1994 COMPARED WITH 1993
 
     Consolidated net sales rose 10.1 percent to $1.2 billion.
 
     The Tobacco segment accounted for 94.7 percent of the $112.6 million sales
increase. The Wine segment also contributed to the overall sales gain, posting
an 11.2 percent increase. Other segment sales were lower due to the absence of
Zig-Zag cigarette papers and related products resulting from the sale of its
distribution rights on March 31, 1993, partially offset by increased sales in
the entertainment business.
<PAGE>   5
 
     Cost of products sold increased 2.2 percent to $251.9 million. Cost of
products sold for the Tobacco segment was slightly higher, as higher unit costs
and increased unit volume for moist smokeless tobacco were offset by lower costs
for other tobacco products resulting from significant volume declines. Wine
segment costs were higher due to volume gains which were partially offset by
lower unit costs. Costs for the Other segment were lower primarily due to the
absence of cigarette papers and lower Canadian excise taxes, partially offset by
increased costs due to volume gains for the entertainment business.
 
     Gross profit increased $107.1 million, or 12.4 percent over 1993 primarily
due to higher selling prices and increased unit volume for moist smokeless
tobacco.
 
     The gross profit percentage rose to 79.4 percent mainly due to the
favorable results for moist smokeless tobacco and volume declines for lower
margin products.
 
     Selling, advertising and administrative expenses rose 10.4 percent to
$330.3 million. Selling and advertising expenses increased for the Tobacco and
Other segments and remained stable in the Wine segment. Administrative and other
expenses were generally higher due to increases in salary and related costs,
increased spending associated with addressing legal and regulatory issues, the
early adoption of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 116,
"Accounting for Contributions Received and Contributions Made" and provisions
recorded for nonstrategic assets.
 
     Net interest expense resulted from interest expense on short-term
borrowings and long-term debt exceeding income from cash equivalent investments.
 
     The comparison of earnings per share for the year 1994 as compared to 1993,
was adversely affected by 3 cents due to several events which occurred in 1993.
On March 31, 1993, the Company sold its distribution rights for Zig-Zag
cigarette papers and related products which resulted in an after-tax gain of $22
million or 10 cents per share. In addition, operating results for the year of
1994 did not include Zig-Zag and related products amounting to 2 cents per
share. Also in 1993, the Company adopted SFAS No. 106 and SFAS No. 109, which
reduced primary earnings per share by 9 cents.
 
     Pretax profit margins decreased slightly to 52.4 percent on earnings before
income taxes of $640.6 million.
 
     The overall tax rate for 1994 increased slightly.
 
     Net earnings increased 11 percent to $387.5 million. Primary earnings per
share rose to $1.87, a 15.4 percent increase over 1993.
 
TOBACCO SEGMENT
 
1995 COMPARED WITH 1994
 
     Tobacco segment sales increased 8.9 percent to $1.2 billion and accounted
for 86.9 percent of consolidated revenues. Smokeless tobacco sales increased 9
percent to $1.1 billion, representing 86 percent of consolidated sales.
 
     The increase in smokeless tobacco sales resulted from higher selling prices
and slightly higher unit volume gains for moist smokeless tobacco products.
Domestic unit volume for moist smokeless tobacco products increased 1.3 percent
in 1995 to 635.4 million cans, as compared with 1994. Fourth quarter unit volume
increased 3.5 percent to 163.7 million cans, compared with the similar 1994
period. Unit volume results for the year and fourth quarter as compared to the
similar periods in the prior year were favorably affected by the national
roll-out of Skoal Flavor Packs, a new variety of a portion pack product in the
fourth quarter of 1995, and were partially offset by distributor inventory
build-up in December of 1994. Adjusting for these events unit volume would have
increased approximately 0.9 percent for the year and 2.3 percent for the fourth
quarter.
 
     Cost of sales for the Tobacco segment was slightly higher, primarily due to
higher unit costs and increased unit volume for moist smokeless tobacco. Moist
smokeless tobacco unit costs increased slightly due to higher leaf tobacco and
packaging costs.
<PAGE>   6
 
     Gross profit for the segment rose substantially during 1995. Higher selling
prices and unit volume gains for moist smokeless tobacco were the primary
reasons for the increase.
 
     Selling expenses increased 6 percent, primarily due to higher costs
associated with the promotion and retail placement of our moist smokeless
products. Field and sales support expenses were generally higher as were
salaries and related costs for the sales force and support personnel.
 
     Advertising costs increased significantly for promotional activities in
support of our moist smokeless tobacco products, and the Skoal Flavor Pack
roll-out during the fourth quarter. Administrative expenses were significantly
higher due to a charge resulting from recording the present value of future
payments due to the former president of United States Tobacco Company under
terms of his employment contract, higher expenses incurred to address legal and
regulatory issues as well as increased support costs.
 
     Operating profit increased 10.3 percent to $720.9 million.
 
1994 COMPARED WITH 1993
 
     Tobacco segment sales rose to $1.1 billion for an increase of 11.2 percent
and accounted for 86.5 percent of consolidated revenues. Smokeless tobacco sales
increased 12.4 percent to $1.0 billion, and represented 85.5 percent of
consolidated sales. Other tobacco product sales decreased significantly due to
volume declines.
 
     The increase in smokeless tobacco sales resulted from higher selling prices
and unit volume gains for moist smokeless tobacco. Domestic unit volume for
moist smokeless tobacco products increased 2.6 percent in 1994 to 627.4 million
cans, as compared with 1993.
 
     Cost of sales for the Tobacco segment was slightly higher as higher unit
costs and increased unit volume for moist smokeless tobacco were offset by lower
costs due to significant volume declines for other tobacco products. Moist
smokeless tobacco unit costs increased slightly due to higher leaf tobacco costs
and overhead expenses.
 
     Gross profit for the segment rose substantially during 1994 as a result of
higher selling prices and unit volume gains for moist smokeless tobacco.
 
     Selling expenses increased 7.5 percent, primarily due to higher costs
associated with promotional activities as well as higher salaries for the sales
force and support personnel.
 
     Advertising costs increased slightly and were directed at the promotion and
support of our moist smokeless tobacco products. Administrative expenses were
significantly higher primarily due to expenses incurred to address legal and
regulatory issues and increased salary and related costs.
 
     Operating profit increased 14.3 percent to $653.7 million.
 
WINE SEGMENT
 
1995 COMPARED WITH 1994
 
     Wine segment revenue increased 22.7 percent to $109.5 million and accounted
for 8.3 percent of consolidated sales. Higher case volume for premium wine
accounted for the majority of the sales gain along with increased bulk wine
sales. Case volume for premium wine increased 18.8 percent, while overall case
volume for the Wine segment increased 15.2 percent. Chateau Ste. Michelle and
Columbia Crest, our two leading brands of premium wine, accounted for
approximately 70 percent of total wine revenue. Unit costs increased slightly
primarily due to lower harvest yields in 1994.
 
     The Company uses grapes both harvested from its own vineyards and purchased
from regional growers in its wine production. Total grape tonnage harvested and
purchased in 1995 was significantly higher than in 1994 and at slightly lower
average costs, which will have a favorable effect on unit costs in 1996.
However, recent adverse weather conditions may affect grape harvest yields in
1996, which may result in higher unit costs in future years.
<PAGE>   7
 
     Gross profit for the Wine segment increased 21.7 percent primarily as a
result of an increase in premium wine case volume which was partially offset by
slightly higher unit costs and higher costs associated with bulk wine sales.
 
     Selling, advertising and administrative expenses were higher in 1995.
Selling expenses increased significantly primarily to support higher volume
levels of premium brands. Advertising expenses were higher and were directed
toward expanding and supporting the brand awareness of premium wines, primarily
Columbia Crest and Domaine Ste. Michelle.
 
     Administrative and other expenses, primarily salary and related expenses,
were slightly higher.
 
     The Wine segment recorded an operating profit of $13.5 million in 1995, an
increase of 52.8 percent.
 
1994 COMPARED WITH 1993
 
     Wine segment revenue increased 11.2 percent to $89.2 million and accounted
for 7.3 percent of consolidated sales. Case volume for premium wine accounted
for the increase, rising 13.2 percent. Overall case volume for the Wine segment
increased 9.2 percent.
 
     Unit costs decreased slightly primarily due to excellent harvest yields in
1992 and 1993.
 
     Total grape tonnage harvested and purchased in 1994 was significantly lower
than the exceptional harvest experienced in 1993 and as a result, the cost for
grapes was slightly higher which will affect future unit costs. However, the
1994 harvest level was adequate to enable the Company to meet its requirements
for premium wine.
 
     Gross profit for the Wine segment increased 13.1 percent primarily as a
result of an increase in premium wine case volume and slightly lower unit costs.
 
     Selling, advertising and administrative expenses remained stable in 1994.
Selling and advertising expenses were directed toward expanding the brand
awareness of premium wines, primarily Columbia Crest and Domaine Ste. Michelle.
 
     Administrative and other expenses, primarily salary and related expenses,
were slightly higher.
 
     The Wine segment recorded an operating profit of $8.8 million in 1994.
 
OTHER SEGMENT
 
1995 COMPARED WITH 1994
 
     Other segment sales were $67.4 million, a 14.4 percent decrease from 1994,
and accounted for 5.1 percent of consolidated sales. Other segment sales
declined primarily due to lower revenues from the entertainment business. An
operating loss for the entertainment business, along with higher spending
associated with developing international markets and provisions recorded for the
anticipated sale of the pipe business resulted in the Other segment operating
loss of $5.3 million in 1995.
 
1994 COMPARED WITH 1993
 
     Other segment sales decreased 3.4 percent in 1994 to $78.7 million and
accounted for 6.4 percent of consolidated sales. Other segment sales were lower
due to the sale of the distribution rights for Zig-Zag cigarette papers and
related products on March 31, 1993, partially offset by higher revenues for the
entertainment business.
 
     The absence of the cigarette paper operations for the entire year, along
with higher spending associated with developing international markets and
provisions recorded for nonstrategic assets more than offset favorable results
for the entertainment business. The Other segment recorded an operating profit
of $1.5 million in 1994.

FOOD AND DRUG ADMINISTRATION (FDA) PROPOSAL
 
     The FDA has published in the Federal Register a proposal to regulate
tobacco products. The contents of the proposal include unprecedented
jurisdiction over the tobacco industry's ability to market, promote and
advertise its products. The comment period for this proposal expired on January
2, 1996, on which date the Company filed written comments with the FDA,
challenging the agency's jurisdiction to regulate the Company's smokeless
tobacco products. Also, in the fall of 1995, United States Tobacco Company filed
suit in Federal District Court in Greensboro, North Carolina, seeking judicial
confirmation that the FDA lacks jurisdiction to regulate the Company's smokeless
tobacco products. The Company is not able to predict the outcome of the FDA's
proposal, or assess the future effect that this proposal may have on its tobacco
business.
 
FINANCIAL CONDITION
 
SOURCES AND USES OF CASH -- OPERATIONS
 
     Cash provided by operating activities, primarily earnings generated by the
Tobacco segment is the major source of funds available to the Company. Cash from
operations for 1995 was $445.1 million as compared to $453.2 million in 1994 and
$367.6 million in 1993.
 
     Net cash provided by operating activities has increased $156.3 million over
the last three years, at an average annual rate of 16.3 percent. Net cash
provided by operating activities in 1995 as compared to 1994 decreased slightly
as higher earnings generated by the Tobacco segment were offset primarily by the
timing of payments for accrued expenses related to the prior year.
 
     Significant inventories of leaf tobacco are required primarily in
connection with our smokeless tobacco products. During the last three years,
$198.3 million was used for the purchase of leaf tobacco and related costs. In
addition, the cost of grapes harvested and purchased totaled $65.4 million over
the last three years.
 
INVESTING ACTIVITIES
 
     Net cash used in investing activities was $14 million in 1995. Purchases of
property, plant and equipment over the last three years totaled $121.1 million.
 
     Major areas of capital spending from 1993 through 1995 were:
 
     Tobacco segment
 
      - Manufacturing, processing and packaging equipment
 
      - Building renovations
 
      - Computer equipment
 
      - Automobiles for the sales force
 
     Wine segment
 
      - Storage capacity and processing equipment
 
      - New facilities and building renovations
 
     Other segment
 
      - Equipment
 
      - Building additions and renovations
 
     Shared assets
 
      - Transportation equipment -- primarily aircraft
 
      - Headquarters renovations
<PAGE>   9
 
     In 1996, the Company's capital program is expected to approximate $70
million, and will primarily include improvements to the tobacco processing and
manufacturing operations and the expansion of wine processing and storage
facilities.
 
     In 1995, cash proceeds from the sale of an aircraft were $17.7 million. In
1993, the Company sold its distribution rights for Zig-Zag cigarette papers and
related products for $39 million.
 
FINANCING ACTIVITIES
 
     Other significant sources and uses of cash over the last three years have
included borrowings, the issuance of common stock, stock repurchases and cash
dividends. Over the last three years the Company has borrowed $200 million
through a combination of its credit facilities and the issuance of commercial
paper. (See Revolving Credit and Term Loan Agreement and Short-Term Lines of
Credit Note.)
 
     Common stock was issued upon the exercise of options granted under the
Company's stock option plans. The Company receives income tax benefits upon the
exercise of certain of these options. Since 1992, funds received from the
exercise of options, together with these tax benefits, totaled $108 million.
 
     During 1995, the Company continued its program to repurchase shares of its
common stock as authorized by the Board of Directors. The current program began
in 1994 upon the completion of a prior program, and authorizes the Company to
repurchase up to 20 million shares of its common stock from time to time in open
market or negotiated transactions to be used in connection with employee benefit
programs and other corporate purposes.
 
     During 1995, the Company repurchased 8.9 million shares at a cost of $274.8
million. As of December 31, 1995, 6.6 million shares remained to be repurchased
under the current program, which is net of put options outstanding on .3 million
shares. (See Other Liabilities Note.)
 
     It is the Company's philosophy that its stockholders should benefit
directly from increases in net earnings. Accordingly, the Company has regularly
increased dividend payments as earnings have risen. During the last three years,
cash dividends distributed to stockholders amounted to $677.8 million, totaling
58.1 percent of net earnings for the period.
 
LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES
 
     Sources of cash exceeded uses of cash by $18.7 million in 1995. Cash
generated from operating activities and borrowings were used to meet the
Company's requirements for seasonal purchases of leaf tobacco, capital projects,
quarterly dividend payments and its stock repurchase program.
 
     The Company maintains adequate credit facilities through short-term lines
of credit with domestic and foreign banks and through its revolving credit and
term loan facility. These facilities can be used as bank financing or as support
for commercial paper borrowings for which the Company has the highest rating. At
December 31, 1995, the Company had $100 million available under its credit
facilities.
 
     The ratio of current assets to current liabilities (current ratio) at
December 31, 1995 was 1.5 to 1 and has averaged 2.3 to 1 over the last three
years. The current ratio declined in 1995 primarily as a result of the short-
term obligations outstanding at December 31, 1995. The Company's liquidity
position is enhanced by the fact that certain inventories are carried at costs
computed under the LIFO method. The average costs of these inventories are $42.9
million more than the amount at which they are carried in the Consolidated
Statement of Financial Position at December 31, 1995.
 
     In 1996, projected leaf tobacco purchases will approximate the amounts
expended in 1995, as the Company continues its plan to maintain higher levels of
leaf tobacco. In addition, significant levels of cash will be required for the
stock repurchase program, dividend payments and capital projects. The Company
anticipates that these and other requirements will be met by amounts generated
from operating activities augmented by short-term borrowings.
 
     The Company intends to maintain appropriate facilities to ensure access to
credit markets providing sufficient financial resources and operational
flexibility.
<PAGE>   10
 
     The percentage of total debt outstanding to stockholders' equity is 68.1
percent. In 1996, the Company intends to maintain $100 million of long-term debt
and approximately the same level of total debt outstanding as of December 31,
1995, by utilizing a combination of its credit facilities and commercial paper,
depending on conditions in the credit markets.
 
     Stockholders' equity decreased in 1995, as the effects of the stock
repurchase program and dividend payments exceeded the effects of net earnings
and common stock issued under the Company's stock option plans.
 
     The return on average stockholders' equity has increased by 68.7 percentage
points to 131.2 percent over the last three years.

DIVIDENDS AND STOCK PRICES
 
CASH DIVIDENDS
 
     The Company increased its 1995 cash dividend by 16.1 percent to an annual
rate of $1.30 per share. Since 1992, the dividend rate has increased 62.5
percent reflecting an average annual increase of 17.6 percent. Total cash
dividends paid by the Company in 1995 were $252.4 million or 58.7 percent of net
earnings. Cash dividends paid to stockholders have exceeded 50 percent of net
earnings in each of the last three years.
 
     In December 1995, the Board of Directors approved a first quarter 1996
dividend of 37 cents per share. This equates to an indicated annual rate of
$1.48, and represents an increase of 13.8 percent. The Company has paid cash
dividends without interruption since 1912. Future dividends depend on many
factors, including internal estimates of future performance and the Company's
need for funds.
 
STOCK PRICES
 
     UST shares are traded on the New York Stock Exchange and the Pacific Stock
Exchange, ticker symbol -- UST.
 
     The number of stockholders of record at December 31, 1995 was 12,320. The

                   NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
                (DOLLARS IN THOUSANDS, EXCEPT PER SHARE AMOUNTS)
 
SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES
 
BASIS OF PRESENTATION
 
     The consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with
generally accepted accounting principles and, as such, include amounts based on
judgments and estimates made by management, which may differ from actual
results. The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the
Company and all of its subsidiaries after the elimination of intercompany
accounts and transactions. Investments in a limited partnership and 50 percent
or less owned companies, accounted for by the equity method, are carried at
amounts equal to the Company's equity in the underlying net assets of such
entities.
 
FAIR VALUE OF FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS
 
     The estimated fair value of amounts reported in the consolidated financial
statements have been determined by using available market information and
appropriate valuation methodologies. All current assets and current liabilities
are carried at their fair value, which approximates market value, because of
their short-term nature. The fair value of long-term investments and long-term
obligations approximate their carrying value.
 
INVENTORIES
 
     Inventories are stated at lower of cost or market. The major portion of
leaf tobacco and briar inventory costs is determined by the last-in, first-out
(LIFO) method. The cost of the remaining inventories is determined by the
first-in, first-out (FIFO) and average cost methods. Leaf tobacco and wine
inventories are included in current assets as a standard industry practice,
notwithstanding the fact that such inventories are carried for several years for
the purpose of curing and aging.
 
PROPERTY, PLANT AND EQUIPMENT
 
     Property, plant and equipment are carried at cost less allowances for
depreciation computed by the straight-line method.
 
STOCK COMPENSATION
 
     The Company accounts for stock option grants in accordance with Accounting
Principles Board (APB) Opinion No. 25, "Accounting for Stock Issued to
Employees." Under the Company's current plans, options may be granted at not
less than the fair market value on the date of grant and therefore no
compensation expense is recognized for the stock options granted. In 1996, the
Company intends to adopt the disclosure provisions of Statement of Financial
Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 123, "Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation."
 
IMPAIRMENT OF LONG-LIVED ASSETS
 
     In 1995, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued SFAS No. 121,
"Accounting for the Impairment of Long-Lived Assets and for Long-Lived Assets to
Be Disposed Of." The Company will adopt SFAS No. 121 in 1996, and the impact, if
any, will not be material.

           NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS -- (CONTINUED)
 
INCOME TAXES
 
     Income taxes are provided on all revenue and expense items included in the
Consolidated Statement of Earnings, regardless of the period in which such items
are recognized for income tax purposes, except for items representing permanent
differences between pretax accounting income and taxable income. Deferred income
taxes result from the future tax consequences associated with temporary
differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for tax and
financial reporting purposes.
 
EARNINGS PER SHARE
 
     Primary earnings per share are calculated by dividing net earnings by the
weighted average number of common and common equivalent shares outstanding
during the period. Common equivalent shares are shares which would be issuable
upon the exercise of outstanding stock options, reduced by the number of shares
which are assumed to be purchased by the Company from the resulting proceeds at
the average market price during the period. For the fully diluted earnings per
share calculation, shares are assumed to be purchased by the Company at the
higher of the average or period-end price and may include additional dilutive
options.

REVOLVING CREDIT AND TERM LOAN AGREEMENT AND SHORT-TERM LINES OF CREDIT
 
     In 1994, the Company entered into a $200 million revolving credit and term
loan agreement with several banks.
 
     The Company had $100 million and $125 million outstanding at December 31,
1995 and 1994, respectively, under this agreement. The weighted average interest
rate on the outstanding borrowings at December 31, 1995 was 6.2 percent.
 
     Under the terms of the agreement, the Company may borrow funds and elect to
pay interest under the "Base Rate," "Competitive Bid" or "Eurodollar" interest
rate provisions. The terms of the agreement provide for a three-year revolving
line of credit. At the Company's option, any balance outstanding thereafter may
be converted into a three-year term loan.
 
     Principal repayments are optional during the revolving credit period, while
36 equal monthly installments are required during the term loan period. The
Company is required to pay a facility fee of 1/10 of 1 percent per annum.

           NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS -- (CONTINUED)
 
     Certain provisions of this agreement require the maintenance of tangible
net worth levels as well as certain financial ratios. The agreement expires in
August of 2000.
 
     At December 31, 1995, the Company had $100 million outstanding under
commercial paper borrowings at a weighted average interest rate of 5.9 percent.
 
     In addition, the Company has short-term lines of credit with domestic and
foreign banks totaling $100 million at December 31, 1995 and 1994. The lines of
credit are generally committed for a one-year period expiring at various times
during 1996, and provide for borrowing at prime rates. These arrangements
require commitment fees which are not significant.
 
OTHER LIABILITIES
 
     Other liabilities include the noncurrent portion of the net pension
liabilities for 1995 and 1994 of $34.5 million and $27.1 million, respectively.
(See Employee Benefit and Compensation Plans Note.)
 
     During the fourth quarter of 1995, the Company sold put options that
entitle the holder to sell a specified number of shares of common stock to the
Company at a predetermined price.
 
     Put options to repurchase 250,000 shares of the Company's stock were
outstanding at December 31, 1995, expiring on various dates between January 1996
and March 1996 with exercise prices ranging from $29.75 to $35.13. At December
31, 1995, the amount related to the Company's potential repurchase obligation,
$8.1 million, has been reclassified from stockholders' equity and is included in
other liabilities. The Company received a premium of $.3 million from the sale
of these put options in 1995. There was no effect on earnings per share for the
periods presented as a result of these put options. (See Consolidated Statement
of Changes in Stockholders' Equity.)
 
CAPITAL STOCK
 
     The Company has two classes of capital stock, preferred stock and common
stock. Preferred stock carries a par value of $.10 and no shares have been
issued. Common stock carries a $.50 par value. Authorized preferred stock is 10
million shares and authorized common stock is 600 million shares.
 
     In 1995, the Company repurchased 8.9 million shares pursuant to a stock
repurchase program authorized by the Board of Directors in 1994. The program
allows the Company to repurchase up to 20 million shares of its common stock
from time to time in open market or in negotiated transactions for use in
connection with employee benefit programs and other corporate purposes. As of
December 31, 1995, 13.1 million shares of the 20 million authorized have been
repurchased and .3 million shares were subject to put options outstanding.
 
     Common stock issued and outstanding at December 31, 1995 and 1994 was
189,186,036 shares and 196,110,436 shares, respectively.
 
     Events causing changes in the issued and outstanding shares are described
in the Consolidated Statement of Changes in Stockholders' Equity.
 
STOCK OPTIONS
 
     The Company maintains three stock option plans, the 1992 and 1982 Stock
Option Plans and a Nonemployee Directors' Stock Option Plan. Under the plans,
options may be granted at not less than the fair market value on the date of
grant.
 
     In May 1995, stockholders approved the Nonemployee Directors' Stock Option
Plan. Under this plan, options to purchase up to 200,000 shares of common stock
may be granted.

                                      UST
 
           NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS -- (CONTINUED)
 
     Under the 1992 Stock Option Plan, options first become exercisable, in
ratable installments or otherwise, over a period of one to five years from the
date of grant and may be exercised up to a maximum of ten years from the date of
grant using various payment methods. Under the Nonemployee Directors' Plan
options first become exercisable six months from the date of grant and may be
exercisable up to a maximum of ten years from the date of grant and must be paid
in full at the time of the exercise.
 
     At December 31, 1995, 6,030,300 shares were available for grant under the
1992 plan and 189,500 shares were available for grant under the Nonemployee
Directors' Plan, while no shares were available under the 1982 plan.
 
     Receivables from the exercise of options in the amount of $11.3 million in
1995, $15.3 million in 1994 and $17.4 million in 1993 have been deducted from
stockholders' equity.

EMPLOYEE BENEFIT AND COMPENSATION PLANS
 
     The Company and its subsidiaries maintain a number of noncontributory
defined benefit pension plans covering substantially all employees over age 21
with at least one year of service. The Company's plan for salaried employees
provides pension benefits based on their highest three-year average
compensation. The Company's funding policy for this plan is to contribute an
amount sufficient to meet or exceed ERISA minimum requirements. All other funded
plans base benefits on the employee's compensation in each year of employment.
The Company's funding policy for these plans is generally to contribute the
annual normal cost plus the amount required to amortize unfunded liabilities
over 20 years from the date established. The Company also maintains unfunded
plans providing pension and additional benefits for certain employees.
 
     The assumptions used to determine expense for 1995, 1994 and 1993 were:

           NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS -- (CONTINUED)
 
     For 1995 and 1994, the net pension assets of $26.1 million and $22.1
million, respectively, consist of prepaid pension costs and are included in
other assets. The noncurrent portion of the net liabilities for 1995 and 1994
are included in other liabilities.
 
     For pension plans whose accumulated benefits exceed assets at December 31,
1995, the Consolidated Statement of Financial Position reflects an additional
minimum liability of $10.8 million: an intangible asset of $3.8 million included
in other assets and a reduction of retained earnings of $4.6 million, which is
net of deferred tax benefits of $2.4 million. At December 31, 1994, the
Consolidated Statement of Financial Position included an additional minimum
liability of $6.1 million: an intangible asset of $3.1 million and a reduction
of retained earnings of $2 million, which is net of deferred tax benefits of $1
million.
 
     Plan assets include marketable equity securities (including common stock of
the Company having a market value of $42.7 million as of December 31, 1995 and
$35.7 million as of December 31, 1994) and corporate and government debt
securities.
 
     The discount rate used in determining the present value of benefit
obligations was 7.5 percent for 1995 and 9 percent for 1994.
 
     The Company sponsors a defined contribution plan (Employees' Savings Plan)
covering substantially all of its employees. The Plan requires one year of
service prior to eligibility for participation. Company contributions are based
upon participant contributions. The expense was $3.8 million in 1995, $3.7
million in 1994 and $3.6 million in 1993.
 
     The Company has an Incentive Compensation Plan which provides for incentive
payments to designated employees based on stated percentages of net income as
defined in the Plan. Expenses under the Plan amounted to $36.9 million for 1995,
$33.5 million for 1994 and $28.8 million for 1993.
 
POSTRETIREMENT BENEFITS OTHER THAN PENSIONS
 
     The Company and certain of its subsidiaries maintain a number of
postretirement welfare benefit plans which provide certain medical and life
insurance benefits to substantially all full-time employees who have attained
certain age and service requirements upon retirement. The health care benefits
are subject to deductibles, co-insurance and in some cases flat dollar
contributions which vary by plan, age and service at retirement. All life
insurance coverage is noncontributory. The welfare plans are not funded.
 
     In 1993, the Company adopted SFAS No. 106, "Employers' Accounting for
Postretirement Benefits Other Than Pensions," and elected to immediately
recognize the accumulated postretirement benefit obligation of $50.8 million
through a one-time cumulative effect adjustment to earnings of $32.7 million,
net of income taxes.
 
     The net periodic postretirement benefit cost for 1995, 1994 and 1993
included the following components:

</TABLE>
 
     The discount rate used in determining the net periodic postretirement
benefit cost was 9 percent for 1995, 7 percent for 1994 and 8 percent for 1993.
 
     The rate of increase in per capita costs of covered health care benefits is
assumed to be 10.6 percent for 1996 and to decrease gradually to 5 percent by
the year 2008 and remain at that level thereafter. The health care cost trend
rate assumption has a significant effect on the amounts reported. To illustrate,
increasing the assumed health care cost trend rates by 1 percentage point in
each year would increase the accumulated postretirement benefit obligation as of
December 31, 1995 by approximately $8.5 million and the 1995 net periodic
postretirement benefit cost by approximately $1.2 million.
 
     The weighted average discount rate used in determining the accumulated
postretirement benefit obligation was 7.5 percent at December 31, 1995 and 9
percent at December 31, 1994.
 
INCOME TAXES
 
     In 1993, the Company adopted SFAS No. 109, "Accounting for Income Taxes,"
which changed the method of accounting for income taxes from the deferred method
to the liability method. The Company reflected this change through a cumulative
effect adjustment which increased net earnings and reduced deferred tax
liabilities reported in the Consolidated Statement of Financial Position by
$12.8 million.
 
     The income tax provision (benefit) consisted of the following:

     Deferred taxes for 1993 includes an $18.1 million benefit resulting from
the adoption of SFAS No. 106. In addition, the deferred tax benefits for 1995,
1994 and 1993 do not reflect the respective tax effects of $1.4 million, $(1.4)
million and $.8 million resulting from the minimum pension liability adjustment
required by SFAS No. 87, "Employers' Accounting for Pensions."
 
     Deferred income taxes arise from temporary differences between the carrying
amounts of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the
amounts used for income tax purposes.
 
     Significant components of deferred tax assets and liabilities as of
December 31 are as follows:

INDUSTRY SEGMENT DATA
 
     The Company's industry segments are Tobacco, Wine and Other. The Company
operates predominately in the tobacco industry as a producer and marketer of
moist smokeless tobacco products. The Company also produces and markets premium
wines as well as a number of nontobacco products. Tobacco segment sales are
principally to a large number of wholesalers and chain stores which are widely
dispersed. In 1995, sales to one wholesale customer accounted for approximately
21 percent of Tobacco segment sales.
 
     The Company operates primarily in the United States; foreign operations and
export sales are not significant. Intersegment sales are accounted for at cost.
 
     Operating profit is total revenue less operating expenses excluding
corporate expenses and interest, net, and in 1993, the gain on disposal of a
product line. Identifiable assets by segment include both assets directly
identified with those operations and an allocable share of jointly used assets.
Corporate assets consist primarily of cash and cash equivalents, other long-term
investments and an allocation of property, plant and equipment associated with
nonsegment activities. Gross capital expenditures for 1995 were $22.2 million
for the Tobacco segment, $11.1 million for the Wine segment, $1.8 million for
the Other segment and $.2 million for Corporate. These amounts were netted with
each segment's allocable share of the sale of a corporate aircraft of $17.7
million along with other dispositions.

           NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS -- (CONTINUED)
 
OTHER MATTERS
 
     The Company has been named in certain litigation against the major domestic
cigarette companies and others seeking damages alleged to be related to the
usage of cigarettes and, in certain of those complaints, "tobacco products,"
some of which contain several allegations relating to smokeless tobacco
products. Each of these actions is in varying stages of pretrial activities.
 
     The Company believes that these pending litigation matters will not result
in any material liability for a number of reasons, including the fact that the
Company has had only limited involvement with cigarettes and the Company's
current percentage of total tobacco industry sales is relatively small. Prior to
1986, the Company manufactured some cigarette products which had a de minimis
market share. From May 1, 1982 to August 1, 1994, the Company distributed a
small volume of imported cigarettes and is indemnified against claims relating
to those products.
 
     In addition, in December 1995, the Company was named in an action brought
by an individual plaintiff and his wife against a number of smokeless tobacco
manufacturers and certain other organizations seeking damages and other relief
in connection with injuries allegedly sustained as a result of his use of
smokeless tobacco products.
 
     The Company believes, and has been so advised by counsel handling these
cases, that it has a number of meritorious defenses to all such pending
litigation. All such cases are, and will continue to be, vigorously defended,
and the Company believes that the ultimate outcome of all such pending
litigation will not have a material adverse effect on the consolidated financial
statements of the Company.
 
     The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has published in the Federal
Register a proposal to regulate tobacco products. The Company filed suit in
Federal District Court in Greensboro, North Carolina, seeking judicial
confirmation that the FDA lacks jurisdiction to regulate smokeless tobacco
products. The Company is not able to predict the outcome of the FDA's proposal,
or assess the future effect that this proposal may have on its tobacco business.
 
     On March 31, 1993, the Company sold its distribution rights for Zig-Zag
cigarette papers and related products for $39 million in cash and additional
consideration for the next ten years. The transaction resulted in a pretax gain
of $35 million, amounting to 10 cents per share.

               REPORT OF ERNST & YOUNG LLP, INDEPENDENT AUDITORS
 
To the Directors and Stockholders UST Inc.
 
     We have audited the accompanying consolidated statement of financial
position of UST Inc. as of December 31, 1995 and 1994, and the related
consolidated statements of earnings, changes in stockholders' equity, and cash
flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 1995. These
financial statements are the responsibility of the Company's management. Our
responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements based on
our audits.
 
     We conducted our audits in accordance with generally accepted auditing
standards. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material
misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting
the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. An audit also includes
assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by
management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation.
We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.
 
     In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present fairly,
in all material respects, the consolidated financial position of UST Inc. at
December 31, 1995 and 1994, and the consolidated results of its operations and
its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31,
1995, in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles.
 
     As discussed in the notes to the financial statements, in 1993 the Company
changed its methods of accounting for income taxes and postretirement benefits
other than pensions.
