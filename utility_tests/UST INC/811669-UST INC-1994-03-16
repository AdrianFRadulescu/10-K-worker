                                     PART I
 
ITEM 1 -- BUSINESS
 
GENERAL
 
     UST Inc. was formed on December 23, 1986 as a Delaware corporation.
Pursuant to a reorganization approved by stockholders at the 1987 Annual
Meeting, United States Tobacco Company (originally incorporated in 1911) became
a wholly owned subsidiary of UST Inc. on May 5, 1987. UST Inc., through its
subsidiaries (collectively "Registrant" unless the context otherwise requires),
is engaged in manufacturing, importing and selling consumer products in the
following industry segments:
 
          Tobacco Products: Registrant's primary activities are manufacturing
     and selling smokeless tobacco (snuff and chewing tobacco) and importing and
     selling other tobacco products.
 
          Wine: Registrant produces and sells wine.
 
          Other: Registrant produces or imports and sells certain other products
     such as smokers' accessories and operates certain commercial agricultural
     properties. The international and video entertainment operations as well as
     certain miscellaneous businesses are included in this segment.
 
INDUSTRY SEGMENT DATA
 
     Registrant hereby incorporates by reference the Consolidated Industry
Segment Data pertaining to the years 1991 through 1993 set forth on page 28 of
its Annual Report to stockholders for the fiscal year ended December 31, 1993
("Annual Report"), which page is included as Exhibit 13.1.
 
                                        1
<PAGE>   3
 
                                TOBACCO PRODUCTS
 
PRINCIPAL PRODUCTS
 
     Registrant's principal smokeless tobacco products and brand names are as
follows:
 
          Moist -- COPENHAGEN, SKOAL LONG CUT, SKOAL, SKOAL BANDITS
 
          Dry -- BRUTON, CC, RED SEAL
 
          Chewing -- WB CUT
 
     It has been claimed that the use of tobacco products may be harmful to
health. To the best of Registrant's knowledge, unresolved controversy continues
to exist among scientists concerning the claims made about tobacco and health.
In 1986, federal legislation was enacted regulating smokeless tobacco products
by, inter alia, requiring health warning notices on smokeless tobacco packages
and advertising and prohibiting the advertising of smokeless tobacco products on
electronic media. A federal excise tax was imposed in 1986, which was increased
in 1991 and 1993. The Health Security Act announced by the Clinton
Administration in 1993 seeks, inter alia, a significant federal excise tax
increase on moist smokeless and other tobacco products. Also, in recent years,
proposals have been made at the federal level for additional regulation of
tobacco products including, inter alia, the requirement of additional warning
notices, the disallowance of advertising and promotion expenses as deductions
under federal tax law, a significant increase of federal excise taxes, a ban or
further restriction of all advertising and promotion, regulation of
environmental tobacco smoke and increased regulation by new or existing federal
agencies. Substantially similar proposals will likely be considered in 1994. In
1993, various state and local governments continued the regulation of tobacco
products, including, inter alia, the imposition of significantly higher taxes,
sampling and advertising bans or restrictions, regulation of environmental
tobacco smoke, negative advertising campaigns and packaging regulations.
Additional state and local legislative and regulatory actions will likely be
considered in 1994. Registrant is unable to assess the future effects these
various actions may have on the sale of its tobacco products.
 
RAW MATERIALS
 
     Except as noted below, raw materials essential to Registrant's business are
generally purchased in domestic markets under competitive conditions.
 
     In 1993, Registrant increased its purchases of dark fired, burley and dark
air cured tobaccos ("tobacco") primarily from domestic sources. Although there
was a slight increase in foreign purchases in 1993, purchases from foreign
suppliers, as a percentage of total tobacco purchased, declined. Such foreign
suppliers were located in Canada, Italy and Mexico. Various factors, including a
failure of domestic tobacco production to continue to increase, may require
Registrant to purchase additional amounts of tobacco from foreign sources in
order to meet future requirements. Tobaccos used in the manufacture of smokeless
tobacco products must be processed and aged by Registrant for a period of two to
three years prior to their use.
 
     Registrant or its suppliers purchase certain flavoring components used in
Registrant's tobacco products from European sources.
 
     At the present time, Registrant has no reason to believe that its future
raw material requirements for its tobacco products will not be satisfied.
However, the continuing availability and the cost of tobacco from both domestic
and foreign sources is dependent upon a variety of factors which cannot be
predicted, including weather, growing conditions, disease, local planting
decisions, overall market demands and other factors.
 
LICENSE AND DISTRIBUTION ARRANGEMENTS
 
     Registrant is a party to license and distribution arrangements that relate
to imported pipe tobacco and imported cigarette products, which have been
entered into in the ordinary course of Registrant's business, none of which is
material to the Tobacco segment.
 
                                        2
<PAGE>   4
 
WORKING CAPITAL
 
     The principal portion of Registrant's operating cash requirements relates
to its need to maintain significant inventories of leaf tobacco, primarily for
manufacturing of smokeless tobacco products, and its need to age and cure
certain of these tobaccos for periods of up to three years prior to use.
 
CUSTOMERS
 
     Registrant sells tobacco products throughout the United States principally
to chain stores and tobacco and grocery wholesalers. Approximately 25% of
Registrant's gross sales of tobacco products are made to five customers, one of
which accounts for more than 10% of such sales. Registrant has maintained
satisfactory relationships with these customers for many years.
 
COMPETITIVE CONDITIONS
 
     The tobacco manufacturing industry in the United States is composed of at
least five domestic companies larger than Registrant and many smaller ones. The
larger companies concentrate on the manufacture and sale of cigarettes; one also
manufactures and sells smokeless tobacco products. Registrant is a well
established and major factor in the smokeless tobacco sector of the overall
tobacco market. Consequently, Registrant competes actively with both larger and
smaller companies in the sale of its tobacco products. Registrant's principal
methods of competition with its tobacco products include quality, advertising,
promotion, sampling, price, product recognition and distribution.
 
                                      WINE
 
     Registrant is an established producer of premium varietal and blended
wines. CHATEAU STE. MICHELLE and COLUMBIA CREST varietal table wines and DOMAINE
STE. MICHELLE sparkling wine are produced by Registrant in the state of
Washington and sold throughout the United States. Registrant also produces and
sells two California premium wines under the labels of VILLA MT. EDEN and CONN
CREEK. Approximately 48% of Registrant's wine sales are made to ten
distributors, no one of which accounts for more than 20% of total wine sales.
Substantially all wines are sold through state-licensed distributors with whom
Registrant maintains satisfactory relationships.
 
     It has been claimed that the use of alcohol beverages may be harmful to
health. To the best of Registrant's knowledge, unresolved controversy continues
to exist among scientists concerning the claims made about alcohol beverages and
health. In 1988, federal legislation was enacted regulating alcohol beverages by
requiring health warning notices on alcohol beverages. Effective in 1991, the
federal excise tax on wine was increased from $.17 a gallon to $1.07 a gallon
for those manufacturers that produce more than 250,000 gallons a year, such as
Registrant. In recent years at the federal level, proposals were made for
additional regulation of alcohol beverages including, inter alia, an excise tax
increase, modification of the required health warning notices and the regulation
of labeling, advertising and packaging. Substantially similar proposals will
likely be considered in 1994. Also in recent years, increased regulation of
alcohol beverages by various states included, inter alia, the imposition of
higher taxes, the requirement of health warning notices and the regulation of
advertising and packaging. Additional state and local legislative and regulatory
actions affecting the marketing of alcohol beverages will likely be considered
during 1994. Registrant is unable to assess the future effects these regulatory
and other actions may have on the sale of its wines.
 
     Registrant uses grapes harvested from its own vineyards, as well as grapes
purchased from independent growers located primarily in Washington State. Total
grape harvest yields experienced by Registrant and throughout Washington State
in 1993 were significantly higher than the prior year and continue to be
adequate to meet requirements for premium varietal wines. From time to time
adverse weather conditions have significantly affected grape harvests from
Washington State. Should any vineyards be destroyed as a result of such
conditions, new vineyards generally require five to six years to provide full
yields. At the present time, Registrant has no reason to believe that its future
raw material requirements for its wine products will not be satisfied.
 
                                        3
<PAGE>   5
 
     Registrant's principal competition comes from many larger, well established
national companies, as well as smaller wine producers. Registrant's principal
methods of competition include quality, price, consumer and trade wine tastings,
competitive wine judging and advertising. Registrant is a minor factor in the
total nationwide business of producing wines.
 
     Registrant concentrates its sales efforts on premium varietal table wines
and sparkling wines. The future of Registrant's wine business will be dependent
on sales, price and volume growth for premium varietal wines, the success of new
products and adequate grape harvest yields from Washington State.
 
                                     OTHER
 
     Included in this segment for 1993 were cigarette papers, pipes, smokers'
accessories, the international operation, video entertainment, agricultural
properties and a majority interest in a company that develops and markets
equipment used in filmmaking. None of the above, singly, constitutes a material
portion of Registrant's operations. Registrant sold its distribution rights to
cigarette papers and related products on March 31, 1993.
 
                        ADDITIONAL BUSINESS INFORMATION
 
CUSTOMERS
 
     In 1993 sales to McLane Co. Inc., a national distributor, exceeded 10% of
Registrant's consolidated revenue.
 
ENVIRONMENTAL REGULATIONS
 
     Registrant does not believe that compliance with federal, state and local
provisions regulating the discharge of materials into the environment or
otherwise relating to the protection of the environment will have a material
effect upon the capital expenditures, earnings or competitive position of
Registrant.
 
NUMBER OF EMPLOYEES
 
     Registrant's average number of employees during 1993 was 3,724.
 
TRADEMARKS
 
     Registrant sells consumer products under a large number of trademarks. All
of the more important trademarks either have been registered or applications
therefor are pending with the United States Patent and Trademark Office.
 
SEASONAL BUSINESS
 
     No material portion of the business of any industry segment of Registrant
is seasonal.
 
ORDERS
 
     Backlog of orders is not a material factor in any industry segment of
Registrant.

     Such principal properties in Registrant's industry segments were utilized
only in connection with Registrant's business operations. Registrant believes
that the above properties at December 31, 1993 were suitable and adequate for
the purposes for which they were used, and were operated at satisfactory levels
of capacity. Registrant is producing moist smokeless tobacco products at both
its Franklin Park and Nashville plants where the combined installed capacity was
planned to meet larger future demand for these products. While current capacity
exceeds current sales, utilization would increase if market demand increases.
 
     All principal properties are owned in fee by Registrant.

ITEM 3 -- LEGAL PROCEEDINGS
 
     Registrant was named in an amended complaint filed on January 17, 1992, in
an action against the major cigarette companies and others entitled Norma R.
Broin, et al. v. Philip Morris Companies, Inc. et al. (Case No.: 91-49738 CA
(22), Circuit Court, 11th Judicial Circuit, Dade County, Florida) seeking five
billion dollars in punitive damages and unspecified compensatory damages. The
action purportedly is brought on behalf of flight attendants who have allegedly
sustained physical, psychological and emotional injuries as a result of exposure
to environmental tobacco smoke on airplanes. On May 19, 1992, the Court
dismissed the class action allegations in plaintiffs' amended complaint.
Plaintiffs filed a notice of appeal from the Court's dismissal on June 17, 1992
and this appeal has not been decided.
 
     Registrant has had only limited involvement with cigarettes. Prior to 1985,
Registrant manufactured some cigarette products which had a de minimis market
share, and Registrant is indemnified for the small volume of imported cigarettes
which it currently distributes.
 
     Registrant believes that the action is without merit, intends to defend it
vigorously and does not believe it will result in any material liability to
Registrant.

    (A)  Commercial paper generally matures within 90 days from date of 
         issuance with no provision for extensions of its maturity.  Amounts in
          1993 are higher than in previous years due to an arbitrage program.
    (B)  Notes payable represent borrowings under lines of credit arrangements.
         In January 1994, Registrant converted this $40 million loan into a 
         revolving credit and term loan agreement and this amount was 
         classified as long-term debt at December 31, 1993. (See Notes to 
         Consolidated Financial Statements -- Revolving Credit and Term Loan 
         Agreement and Short-Term Lines of Credit.)
    (C)  Represents maximum amount outstanding at any time during the period.
    (D)  The average amount outstanding during the period was computed by 
         dividing the total of the monthly average outstanding principal 
         balances by twelve.
    (E)  The weighted average interest rate during the period was computed by 
         dividing the actual interest expense by the average short-term debt 
         outstanding.

                              EMPLOYMENT AGREEMENT
 
     AGREEMENT made this first day of December, 1993, between UST INC., a
Delaware corporation (the "Company"), and John J. Bucchignano (the "Executive").
 
     The Executive is presently employed by the Company as Executive Vice
President and Chief Financial Officer.
 
     The Board of Directors of the Company (the "Board") recognizes that the
Executive's contribution to the growth and success of the Company during the
past nine years has been substantial. The Board desires to provide for the
continued employment of the Executive and to make certain changes in the
Executive's employment arrangements with the Company which the Board has
determined will reinforce and encourage the continued attention and dedication
to the Company of the Executive as a member of the Company's management, in the
best interest of the Company and its shareholders. The Executive is willing to
commit himself to continue to serve the Company, on the terms and conditions
herein provided.
 
     In order to effect the foregoing, the Company and the Executive wish to
enter into an employment agreement on the terms and conditions set forth below.
Accordingly, in consideration of the premises and the respective covenants and
agreements of the parties herein contained, and intending to be legally bound
hereby, the parties hereto agree as follows:
 
     1. Employment.  The Company hereby agrees to continue to employ the
Executive, and the Executive hereby agrees to continue to serve the Company, on
the terms and conditions set forth herein.
 
     2. Term.  The employment of the Executive by the Company as provided in
Section 1 will commence on the date hereof and end on November 30, 1996, unless
further extended or sooner terminated as hereinafter provided. On November 30,
1994, and on the last day of November of each year thereafter, the term of the
Executive's employment shall be automatically extended one (1) additional year
unless, prior to such last day of November, the Company shall have delivered to
the Executive or the Executive shall have delivered to the Company written
notice that the term of the Executive's employment hereunder will not be
extended. In no event, however, shall the term of the Executive's employment
extend beyond the end of the calendar month in which the Executive's 65th
birthday occurs.
 
     3. Position and Duties.  The Executive shall serve as Executive Vice
President and Chief Financial Officer of the Company and shall have such
responsibilities and authority as may from time to time be assigned to the
Executive of the Board, the Chief Executive Officer of the Chief Operating
Officer of the Company. The Executive shall devote substantially all his working
time and efforts to the business and affairs of the Company.
 
     4. Place of Performance.  In connection with the Executive's employment by
the Company, the Executive shall be based at the principal executive offices of
the Company in Greenwich, Connecticut, except for required travel on the
Company's business to an extent substantially consistent with present business
travel obligations.
 
     5. Compensation and Related Matters.
 
          (a) Salary.  During the period of the Executive's employment
     hereunder, the Company shall pay to the Executive a salary at an annual
     rate not less than the rate in effect as of the date hereof or such higher
     rate as may from time to time be determined by the Board, such salary to be
     payable in accordance with the Company's then regular payroll practice.
     This salary may be increased from time to time in accordance with normal
     business practices of the Company and, if so increased, shall not
     thereafter during the term of this Agreement be decreased. Compensation of
     the Executive by salary payments shall not be deemed exclusive and shall
     not prevent the Executive from participating in any other compensation or
     benefit plan of the Company. The salary payments (including any increased
     salary payments) hereunder shall not in any way limit or reduce any other
     obligation of the Company
<PAGE>   2
 
     hereunder, and no other compensation, benefit or payment hereunder shall in
     any way limit or reduce the obligation of the Company to pay the
     Executive's salary hereunder.
 
          (b) Expenses.  During the term of the Executive's employment
     hereunder, the Executive shall be entitled to receive prompt reimbursement
     for all reasonable expenses incurred by the Executive in performing
     services hereunder, including all expenses of travel and living expenses
     while away from home on business or at the request of and in the service of
     the Company, provided that such expenses are incurred and accounted for in
     accordance with the policies and procedures established by the Company.
 
          (c) Other Benefits.  The Company shall maintain in full force and
     effect, and the Executive shall be entitled to continue to participate in,
     all of the employee benefit plans and arrangements in effect on the date
     hereof in which the Executive participates or plans or arrangements
     providing the Executive with at least equivalent benefits thereunder
     (including without limitation each pension and retirement plan and
     arrangement, supplemental pension and retirement plan and arrangement,
     stock option plan, life insurance and health-and-accident plan and
     arrangement, medical insurance plan, disability plan, survivor income plan,
     relocation plan and vacation plan); provided, however, that this provision
     shall not apply to the Company's Incentive Compensation Plan. The Company
     shall not make any changes in such plans or arrangements that would
     adversely affect the Executive's rights or benefits thereunder; provided,
     however, that, prior to a change in control of the Company (as defined in
     Section 8(d) (iii) hereof), such a change may be made if it occurs pursuant
     to a program applicable to all executives of the Company and does not
     result in a proportionately greater reduction in the rights of or benefits
     to the Executive as compared with any other executive of the Company. The
     Executive shall be entitled to participate in or receive benefits under any
     employee benefit plan or arrangement made available by the Company in the
     future to its executives and key management employees, subject to and on a
     basis consistent with the terms, conditions and overall administration of
     such plans and arrangements. Nothing paid to the Executive under any plan
     or arrangement presently in effect or made available in the future shall be
     deemed to be in lieu of the salary payable to the Executive pursuant to
     subsection (a) of this Section. Any payments or benefits payable to the
     Executive hereunder in respect of any calendar year during which the
     Executive is employed by the Company for less than the entire such year
     shall, unless otherwise provided in the applicable plan or arrangement, be
     prorated in accordance with the number of days in such calendar year during
     which he is so employed.
 
          (d) Vacations.  The Executive shall be entitled to the number of
     vacation days in each calendar year, and to compensation in respect of
     earned but unused vacation days, determined in accordance with the
     Company's vacation plan. The Executive shall also be entitled to all paid
     holidays given by the Company to its executives.
 
          (e) Services Furnished.  The Company shall furnish the Executive with
     office space, stenographic assistance and such other facilities and
     services as shall be suitable to the Executive's position and adequate for
     the performance of his duties as set forth in Section 3 hereof.
 
     6. Offices.  The Executive agrees to serve without additional compensation,
if elected or appointed thereto, as a director of the Company and any of its
subsidiaries and in one or more executive offices of any of the Company's
subsidiaries, provided that the Executive is indemnified for serving in any and
all such capacities on a basis no less favorable than is currently provided by
Article VIII of the Company's By-Laws. The Executive further agrees that, upon
the termination of the Executive's employment for any reason, he will resign any
directorship held with respect to the Company or any of its subsidiaries,
effective as of the Date of Termination (as defined in Section 8(f) hereof).
 
     7. Improvements; Confidential Information.  Annex I hereto, as from time to
time amended, is a form of Employee Secrecy Agreement between the Executive and
the Company, concerning the treatment of Improvements and Confidential
Proprietary Information (as defined therein) and related matters.
 
     8. Termination.  The Executive's employment hereunder may be terminated
without any breach of this Agreement only under the following circumstances:
 
          (a) Death.  The Executive's employment hereunder shall terminate upon
     his death.
<PAGE>   3
 
          (b) Disability.  If, as a result of the Executive's incapacity due to
     physical or mental illness, the Executive shall have been absent from his
     duties hereunder on a full-time basis for the entire period of six
     consecutive months, and within thirty (30) days after written notice of
     termination is given (which may occur before or after the end of such
     six-month period) shall not have returned to the performance of his duties
     hereunder on a full-time basis, the Company may terminate the Executive's
     employment hereunder.
 
          (c) Cause.  The Company may terminate the Executive's employment
     hereunder for Cause. For purposes of this Agreement, the Company shall have
     "Cause" to terminate the Executive's employment hereunder upon (i) the
     willful and continued failure by the Executive to substantially perform his
     duties hereunder (other than any such failure resulting from the
     Executive's incapacity due to physical or mental illness), after demand for
     substantial performance is delivered by the Company that specifically
     identifies the manner in which the Company believes the Executive has not
     substantially performed his duties, or (ii) the willful engaging by the
     Executive in misconduct which is materially injurious to the Company,
     monetarily or otherwise (including, but not limited to, conduct that
     constitutes Competitive Activity, as defined in Section 10 hereof) or (iii)
     the willful violation by the Executive of the provisions of the Employee
     Secrecy Agreement in the form of Annex I hereto; provided, however, that
     upon the occurrence of any of the events constituting a change in control
     of the Company (as defined in Section 8(d)(iii) hereof), the foregoing
     definition of Cause shall cease to apply, and the Company shall have
     "Cause" to terminate the Executive's employment hereunder only if the
     Executive commits an act or acts of dishonesty constituting a felony under
     the laws of the United States or any State thereof and resulting or
     intended to result directly or indirectly in gain or personal enrichment at
     the expense of the Company. For purposes of this subsection, no act, or
     failure to act, on the Executive's part shall be considered "willful"
     unless done, or omitted to be done, by him not in good faith and without
     reasonable belief that his action or omission was in the best interest of
     the Company. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Executive shall not be
     deemed to have been terminated for Cause without (1) reasonable notice to
     the Executive setting forth the reasons for the Company's intention to
     terminate for Cause, (2) an opportunity for the Executive, together with
     his counsel, to be heard before the Chief Executive Officer of the Company
     or his specifically designated representative, and (3) delivery to the
     Executive of a Notice of Termination, as defined in subsection (e) hereof,
     from the Chief Executive Officer of the Company or his specifically
     designated representative finding that in the good faith opinion of such
     executive or representative the Executive was guilty of conduct set forth
     above in clause (i), (ii) or (iii) hereof, and specifying the particulars
     thereof in detail.
 
          (d) Termination by the Executive.  (i) The Executive may terminate his
     employment hereunder (A) for Good Reason or (B) if his health should become
     impaired to an extent that makes his continued performance of his duties
     hereunder hazardous to his physical or mental health or his life, provided
     that the Executive shall have furnished the Company with a written
     statement from a qualified doctor to such effect and provided, further,
     that, at the Company's request, the Executive shall submit to an
     examination by a doctor selected by the Company and such doctor shall have
     concurred in the conclusion of the Executive's doctor.
 
          (ii) For purposes of this Agreement, "Good Reason" shall mean (A) a
     change in control of the Company (as defined below), (B) a failure by the
     Company to comply with any material provision of this Agreement which has
     not been cured within ten (10) days after notice of such noncompliance has
     been given by the Executive to the Company, or (C) any purported
     termination of the Executive's employment which is not effected pursuant to
     a Notice of Termination satisfying the requirements of subsection (e)
     hereof (and for purposes of this Agreement no such purported termination
     shall be effective).
 
          (iii) For purposes of this Agreement, a "change in control of the
     Company" shall be deemed to have occurred if (A) any "person" (as such term
     is used in Sections 13(d) and 14(d)of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934,
     as amended (the "Exchange Act")), other than the Company, any "person" who
     on the date hereof is a director or officer of the Company, any trustee or
     other fiduciary holding securities under an employee benefit plan of the
     Company, or any corporation owned, directly or indirectly, by the
     stockholders of the Company in substantially the same proportions as their
     ownership of stock of the
<PAGE>   4
 
     Company, is or becomes the "beneficial owner" (as defined in Rule 13d-3
     under the Exchange Act), directly or indirectly, of securities of the
     Company representing 20% or more of the combined voting power of the
     Company's then outstanding securities; (B) during any period of two
     consecutive years (not including any period prior to the execution of this
     Agreement), individuals who at the beginning of such period constitute the
     Board, and any new director (other than a director designated by a person
     who has entered into an agreement with the Company to effect a transaction
     described in clause (A) or (C) of this paragraph) whose election by the
     Board or nomination for election by the Company's stockholders was approved
     by a vote of at least two-thirds (2/3) of the directors then still in
     office who either were directors at the beginning of the period or whose
     election or nomination for election was previously so approved, cease for
     any reason to constitute at least a majority thereof; or (C) the
     shareholders of the Company approve a merger or consolidation of the
     Company with any other corporation, other than a merger or consolidation
     which would result in the voting securities of the Company outstanding
     immediately prior thereto continuing to represent (either by remaining
     outstanding or by being converted into voting securities of the surviving
     entity) more than 80% of the combined voting power of the voting securities
     of the Company or such surviving entity outstanding immediately after such
     merger or consolidation, or the shareholders of the Company approve a plan
     of complete liquidation of the Company or an agreement for the sale or
     disposition by the Company of all or substantially all of the Company's
     assets.
 
          (e) Any termination of the Executive's employment by the Company or by
     the Executive (other than termination pursuant to subsection (a) hereof)
     shall be communicated by written Notice of Termination to the other party
     hereto. For purposes of this Agreement, a "Notice of Termination" shall
     mean a notice which shall indicate the specific termination provision in
     this Agreement relied upon and shall set forth in reasonable detail the
     facts and circumstances claimed to provide a basis for termination of the
     Executive's employment under the provision so indicated.
 
          (f) "Date of Termination" shall mean (i) if the Executive's employment
     is terminated by his death, the date of his death, (ii) if the Executive's
     employment is terminated pursuant to subsection (b) hereof, thirty (30)
     days after Notice of Termination is given (provided that the Executive
     shall not have returned to the performance of his duties on a full-time
     basis during such thirty (30)-day period), (iii) if the Executive's
     employment is terminated pursuant to subsection (c) hereof, the date
     specified in the Notice of Termination, and (iv) if the Executive's
     employment is terminated for any other reason, the date on which a Notice
     of Termination is given; provided, however, that, if within thirty (30)
     days after any Notice of Termination is given the party receiving such
     Notice of Termination notifies the other party that a dispute exists
     concerning the termination, the Date of Termination shall be the date on
     which the dispute is finally determined, either by mutual written agreement
     of the parties, by a binding and final arbitration award or by a final
     judgment, order or decree of a court of competent jurisdiction (the time
     for appeal therefrom having expired and no appeal having been perfected).
 
     9. Compensation Upon Termination or During Disability.
 
          (a) During any period that the Executive fails to perform his duties
     hereunder as a result of incapacity due to physical or mental illness
     ("disability period"), the Executive shall continue to receive his full
     salary at the rate then in effect for such period until his employment is
     terminated pursuant to Section 8(b) hereof, provided that payments so made
     to the Executive during the first 180 days of the disability period shall
     be reduced by the sum of the amounts, if any, payable to the Executive at
     or prior to the time of any such payment under disability benefit plans of
     the Company or under the Social Security disability insurance program, and
     which amounts were not previously applied to reduce any such payment. If
     the Executive shall terminate his employment under clause (B) of Section
     8(d)(i) hereof, the Company shall pay the Executive his full salary through
     the Date of Termination at the rate in effect at the time Notice of
     Termination is given.
 
          (b) If the Executive's employment is terminated by his death, the
     Company shall (i) pay to the Executive's spouse, or if he leaves no spouse,
     to his estate, commencing on the next succeeding payroll day (as determined
     in accordance with the Company's then regular payroll practice) and,
     thereafter, on each succeeding payroll day until a total of six payments
     has been made, an amount on each payment
<PAGE>   5
 
     date equal to the periodic salary payment payable to the Executive pursuant
     to Section 5(a) hereof at the time of his death; and (ii) provide to the
     Executive's surviving spouse and dependent children group medical benefits
     on a basis not less favorable than that to which they were entitled
     immediately prior to the Executive's death.
 
          (c) If the Executive's employment shall be terminated for Cause, the
     Company shall pay the Executive his full salary through the Date of
     Termination at the rate in effect at the time Notice of Termination is
     given and the Company shall have no further obligations to the Executive
     under this Agreement.
 
          (d) If (A) in breach of this Agreement, the Company shall terminate
     the Executive's employment other than pursuant to Section 8(b) or 8(c)
     hereof (it being understood that a purported termination pursuant to
     Section 8(b) or (c) hereof which is disputed and finally determined not to
     have been proper shall be a termination by the Company in breach of this
     Agreement) or (B) the Executive shall terminate his employment for Good
     Reason, then
 
             (i) the Company shall pay the Executive his full salary through the
        Date of Termination at the rate in effect at the time Notice of
        Termination is given;
 
             (ii) in lieu of any further salary payments to the Executive for
        periods subsequent to the Date of Termination, the Company shall pay as
        severance pay to the Executive an amount equal to the product of (A) the
        sum of (1) the Executive's annual salary rate in effect as of the Date
        of Termination and (2) the highest annual amount payable to the
        Executive under the Company's Incentive Compensation Plan with respect
        to any of the three calendar years immediately preceding the Date of
        Termination, provided, however, that if payment results from a
        termination based on a change in control of the Company, the amount
        taken into account under this clause (2) shall in no event exceed
        seventy-five percent (75%) of the amount taken into account under clause
        (1) hereof, and (B) if payment results from a termination based on a
        change in control of the Company, the number three, or if payment
        results from any other cause, the greater of the number of years
        (including partial years) remaining in the term of employment hereunder
        or the number three; such payment to be made (X) if resulting from a
        termination based on a change of control of the Company, in a lump sum
        on or before the fifth day following the Date of Termination, or (Y) if
        resulting from any other cause, in substantially equal periodic
        installments in accordance with the Company's then regular payroll
        practice, commencing with the month in which the Date of Termination
        occurs and continuing for the number of consecutive periodic payment
        dates (including the first such date as aforesaid) equal to the product
        obtained by multiplying the number of years (including partial years)
        applicable under clause (B) hereof by 24 (if the Company's then regular
        payroll practice is semimonthly payroll dates), 26 (if the Company's
        then regular payroll practice is biweekly payroll dates) or such other
        number as is appropriate to reflect the Company's then regular payroll
        practice;
 
             (iii) if termination of the Executive's employment arises out of a
        breach by the Company of this Agreement, the Company shall pay all other
        damages to which the Executive may be entitled as a result of such
        breach, including damages for any and all loss of benefits to the
        Executive under the Company's employee benefit plans (other than the
        Company's Incentive Compensation Plan and Employees' Savings Plan) which
        the Executive would have received if the Company had not breached this
        Agreement and had the Executive's employment continued for the full term
        provided in Section 2 hereof (including specifically but without
        limitation the benefits which the Executive would have been entitled to
        receive pursuant to the Company's Retirement Income Plan, the Officers'
        Supplemental Retirement Plan and any other supplemental retirement
        income plan or arrangement had his employment continued for the full
        term provided in Section 2 hereof at the rate of compensation specified
        herein), and including all legal fees and expenses incurred by him as a
        result of such termination; provided, however, that nothing contained in
        this Agreement, including without limitation in this paragraph (iii),
        shall be construed to entitle the Executive to be granted any stock
        options pursuant to any stock option plan maintained by the Company or
        to receive any amount in damages in lieu of the grant of such options;
        and further provided, however, that, if the
<PAGE>   6
 
        Date of Termination occurs prior to the occurrence of a change in
        control of the Company, the legal fees and expenses to which an
        Executive is entitled pursuant to this paragraph (iii) (and Section 16
        hereof) shall not exceed, in the aggregate, the sum of $50,000.
 
          (e) Whether or not the Executive becomes entitled to the payment
     provided under subsection (d)(ii) or (iii) hereof or under subsection (f)
     hereof, if any of the Total Payments (as hereinafter defined) will be
     subject to the tax (the "Excise Tax") imposed by section 4999 of the
     Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the "Code"), the Company shall
     pay to the Executive, no later than the fifth day following the Date of
     Termination (or such other date as is hereinafter described), an additional
     amount (the "Gross-Up Payment") such that the net amount retained by him,
     after deduction of any Excise Tax on the Total Payments and any federal and
     state and local income tax upon the payment provided for by this paragraph,
     shall be equal to the excess of the Total Payments over the payment
     provided for by this paragraph. For purposes of determining whether any of
     the Total Payments will be subject to the Excise Tax and the amount of such
     Excise Tax, (i) all payments or benefits received or to be received by the
     Executive in connection with a change in control of the Company or the
     termination of the Executive's employment (whether payable pursuant to the
     terms of this Agreement or of any other plan, arrangement or agreement with
     the Company, its successors, any person whose actions result in a change in
     control or any person affiliated (or which, as a result of the completion
     of the transactions causing a change in control, will become affiliated)
     with the Company or such person within the meaning of section 1504 of the
     Code (the "Total Payments")) shall be treated as "parachute payments"
     (within the meaning of section 280G(b)(2) of the Code) unless, in the
     opinion of tax counsel selected by the Company's independent auditors and
     reasonably acceptable to the Executive, such payments or benefits (in whole
     or in part) do not constitute parachute payments, including by reason of
     section 280G(b)(4)(A) of the Code, and all "excess parachute payments"
     (within the meaning of section 280G(b)(1) of the Code) shall be treated as
     subject to the Excise Tax, unless in the opinion of such tax counsel such
     excess parachute payments represent reasonable compensation for services
     actually rendered within the meaning of section 280G(b)(4)(B) of the Code,
     or are not otherwise subject to the Excise Tax, and (ii) the value of any
     noncash benefits or any deferred payment or benefit shall be determined by
     the Company's independent auditors in accordance with the principles of
     sections 280G(d)(3) and (4) of the Code. For purposes of determining the
     amount of the Gross-Up Payment, the Executive shall be deemed to pay
     federal income taxes at the highest marginal rate of federal income
     taxation in the calendar year in which the Gross-Up Payment is to be made
     and state and local income taxes at the highest marginal rate of taxation
     in the state and locality of the residence of the Executive on the Date of
     Termination (or such other date as is hereinafter described), net of the
     maximum reduction in federal income taxes that could be obtained from
     deduction of such state and local taxes. In the event that the Excise Tax
     is subsequently determined to be less than the amount taken into account
     hereunder at the Date of Termination (or such other date as is hereinafter
     described), the Executive shall repay to the Company at the time that the
     amount of such reduction in Excise Tax is finally determined the portion of
     the Gross-Up Payment attributable to such reduction (plus the portion of
     the Gross-Up Payment attributable to the Excise Tax and federal and state
     and local income tax imposed on the Gross-Up Payment being repaid by the
     Executive if such repayment results in a reduction in Excise Tax or a
     federal and state and local income tax deduction) plus interest on the
     amount of such repayment at the applicable federal rate (as defined in
     section 1274(d) of the Code). In the event that the Excise Tax is
     determined to exceed the amount taken into account hereunder at the time of
     the termination of the employment of the Executive, or at such other time
     as is hereinafter described (including by reason of any payment the
     existence or amount of which cannot be determined at the time of the
     Gross-Up Payment), the Company shall make an additional gross-up payment in
     respect of such excess (plus any interest payable with respect to such
     excess) at the time that the amount of such excess is finally determined.
     If an Executive who remains in the employ of the Company becomes entitled
     to the payment provided for by this paragraph, such payment shall be made
     no later than the later of (x) the fifth day following the date on which
     the Executive notifies the Company that he is subject to the Excise Tax and
     (y) ten days prior to the date on which the Excise Tax is initially due.
 
          (f) Unless the Executive is terminated for Cause, the Company shall
     maintain in full force and effect, for the continued benefit of the
     Executive for the greater of the number of years (including partial
<PAGE>   7
 
     years) remaining in the term of employment hereunder or the number three
     (3), all employee welfare benefit plans (including, but not limited to, all
     life insurance and health-and-accident plans and arrangements, medical
     insurance plans, disability plans, survivor income plans, relocation plans
     and vacation plans and programs) in which the Executive was entitled to
     participate immediately prior to the Date of Termination provided that the
     Executive's continued participation is possible under the general terms and
     provisions of such plans and programs. In the event that the Executive's
     participation in any such plan or program is barred, the Company shall
     arrange to provide the Executive with benefits substantially similar to
     those which the Executive would otherwise have been entitled to receive
     under such plans and programs from which his continued participation is
     barred.
 
          (g) The Executive shall not be required to mitigate the amount of any
     payment provided for in this Section 9 by seeking other employment or
     otherwise.
 
     10. Non competition.  The Executive agrees that he will not engage in any
Competitive Activity during any period with respect to which he is entitled to
severance pay pursuant to Section 9(d) (ii) hereof or to employee benefits
pursuant to Section 9(f) hereof; provided, however, that this provision shall
cease to apply upon the occurrence of any of the events constituting a change in
control of the Company. For purposes of this Section, "Competitive Activity"
shall mean activity, without the written consent of an authorized officer of the
Company (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld), consisting of the
Executive's participation in the management of, or his acting as a consultant
for or employee of, any business operation of any enterprise if such operation
(a "Competitive Operation") is then in substantial and direct competition with a
principal business operation of the Company, as now or hereafter designated by
the Board; provided, however, that no business operation may be designated a
principal business operation of the Company unless the Company's profits, sales
or assets attributable to such business operation amount to at least 10 percent
(10%) of the Company's total profits, sales or assets. "Competitive Activity"
shall not include (1) the mere ownership of securities in any enterprise; or (2)
the participation in the management of, or acting as a consultant for or
employee of, any enterprise or any business operation thereof, other than in
connection with a Competitive Operation of such enterprise, provided that the
Executive does not furnish advice with respect to inventions, processes,
customers, methods of distribution or methods of manufacture of any Competitive
Operation of such enterprise.
 
     11. Successors; Binding Agreement.
 
          (a) The Company will require any successor (whether direct or
     indirect, by purchase, merger, consolidation or otherwise) to all or
     substantially all of the business and/or assets of the Company, by
     agreement in form and substance satisfactory to the Executive, to expressly
     assume and agree to perform this Agreement in the same manner and to the
     same extent that the Company would be required to perform it if no such
     succession had taken place. Failure of the Company to obtain such agreement
     prior to the effectiveness of any such succession shall be a breach of this
     Agreement and shall entitle the Executive to compensation from the Company
     in the same amount and on the same terms as he would be entitled to
     hereunder if he terminated his employment for Good Reason, except that for
     purposes of implementing the foregoing, the date on which any such
     succession becomes effective shall be deemed the Date of Termination. As
     used in this Agreement, "Company" shall mean the Company as hereinbefore
     defined and any successor to its business and/or assets as aforesaid which
     executes and delivers the agreement provided for in this Section 11 or
     which otherwise becomes bound by all the terms and provisions of this
     Agreement by operation of law.
 
          (b) This Agreement and all rights of the Executive hereunder shall
     inure to the benefit of and be enforceable by the Executive's personal or
     legal representatives, executors, administrators, successors, heirs,
     distributees, devisees and legatees. If the Executive should die while any
     amounts would still be payable to him hereunder if he had continued to
     live, all such amounts, unless otherwise provided herein, shall be paid in
     accordance with the terms of this Agreement to the Executive's devisee,
     legatee, or other designee or, if there be no such designee, to the
     Executive's estate.
 
     12. Notice.  For the purposes of this Agreement, notices, demands and all
other communications provided for in this Agreement shall be in writing and
shall be deemed to have been duly given when delivered

or discharged unless such waiver, modification or discharge is agreed to in

such other officer as may be specifically designated by the Board. No waiver by
either party hereto at any time of any breach by the other party hereto of, or

subject matter hereof have been made by either party which are not set forth
expressly in this Agreement and the Employee Secrecy Agreement in the form of

effect.
 
     15. Counterparts.  This Agreement may be executed in one or more

                                    UST INC.
 
                           EMPLOYEE SECRECY AGREEMENT
 
     THIS AGREEMENT, entered into this first day of December 1993, by and
between UST Inc., a corporation existing under the laws of Delaware and having
its principal offices in Greenwich, Connecticut (hereinafter referred to as
"UST"), and John J. Bucchignano, residing at 85 Walnut Hill Road, Bethel,
Connecticut 06801 (hereinafter referred to as the "Employee").
 
                             W I T N E S S E T H :
 
     WHEREAS, UST (which for the purposes of this Agreement shall include its
subsidiaries and affiliates) has developed and uses commercially valuable
technical and non-technical information (hereinafter "Proprietary Information")
and, to guard the legitimate interest of UST, it is necessary to protect the
Proprietary Information either by patents or by holding its secret or
confidential or to copyright such Proprietary Information as may be sought to be
copyrighted; and
 
     WHEREAS, the aforesaid Proprietary Information is vital to the success of
UST's business, provides UST with commercial advantages vis-a-vis its
competitors and Employee through his employment may become acquainted therewith
and may contribute thereto either through inventions, discoveries, improvements
or otherwise; and
 
     WHEREAS, the disclosure of that Proprietary Information such as
confidential or secret information could be very harmful to UST's business and
its employees, in turn, could suffer loss;
 
     NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of past and present employment and in
confirmation of the terms and conditions of said employment it is agreed as
follows:
 
          1. All ideas, methods, formulae, inventions, improvements and
     developments directly or indirectly relating to aging, curing, flavoring,
     manufacturing, processing and/or packaging of tobacco products and those
     directly or indirectly relating to other products and fields of activity of
     Employee's employment (whether patentable or unpatentable) made, conceived
     or developed by Employee alone or jointly with one or more others during
     the term of Employee's employment (whether at the request or suggestion of
     UST or otherwise and during the regular hours of work or otherwise) and
     within one (1) year thereafter (hereinafter called "Improvements") shall be
     the property of UST, and Employee shall disclose each of the same promptly
     and in such manner as requested by UST, including by delivery to UST of all
     papers, drawings, models, data and any other material relating to the
     Improvements. Unless and except if a specific waiver has been granted for
     any copyright or a renewal of such copyright or any derivative work
     thereof, such Improvements shall also include copyrightable works which are
     hereby acknowledged to be works "made-for-hire", and shall include for the
     benefit of UST all derivative, underlying, secondary or similar rights
     derived from such copyright.
 
          2. Employee shall keep such records as UST considers desirable in
     connection with the conception, disclosure and utilization of the
     Improvements and shall execute all proper documents to insure that UST
     shall have the full benefit, enjoyment, ownership, and title to
     Improvements, including without limitations, patent disclosures,
     disclosures of Proprietary Information, patent applications and
     assignments, trademark rights, copyrights, etc.
 
          In the event UST is unable, for any reason whatsoever, to secure
     Employee's signature to any lawful and necessary documents required for the
     purpose stated above, Employee hereby irrevocably designates and appoints
     UST, and its duly authorized officers and agents, as his agent(s) and
     attorney(s)-in-fact to act for and on behalf of Employee, to execute and
     file any such documents and to do all other lawfully permitted acts to
     further the prosecution and issuance of any governmental grant such as
     letters patent, copyrights, author's certificates, etc., thereof with the
     same legal force and effect as if actually executed by Employee.
<PAGE>   11
 
          3. Employee anticipates that among the Proprietary Information he will
     receive e.g. certain confidential or trade secret information which
     directly or indirectly relates to the business of UST, and which he
     understands includes (i) the Improvements and the details of the
     construction and operation of machines and the processes followed by UST in
     the aging, curing, flavoring, processing, manufacturing and/or packaging of
     UST products, (ii) the volumes of the various products manufactured or sold
     by UST, and the relationships between the various products from the
     standpoint of the dollar volumes of such sales, (iii) the gross and net
     profits of UST products, and the sources of materials which are used to
     produce such products including the quantities and dollar values of such
     materials purchased by UST, (iv) the blending and other procedures involved
     in the blending and other procedures involved in producing the products
     manufactured or sold by UST, and (v) the sales and marketing plans and
     programs of or for UST including advertising, promotions, distribution,
     credit terms and customer information; and he will not at any time, whether
     during said employment or thereafter, directly or indirectly, disclose this
     Proprietary Information to others, except in the course of said employment,
     and then he shall not act contrary to specific instructions from UST.
 
          4. Employee, upon termination of employment, shall promptly deliver to
     UST all drawings, blueprints, manuals, letters, notes, reports, and all
     other materials relating to Proprietary Information in his possession or
     under his control, without retaining any copies thereof.
 
          5. If any Proprietary Information is required to be disclosed by a
     governmental request or in a judicial process, anyone served with such
     request shall promptly notify UST without first disclosing any such
     Proprietary Information. The obligation to notify UST assures UST that it
     may obtain sufficient counsel or seek a protective order or an order by the
     court placing such information under seal or designating such information
     "Proprietary Information" or "Trade Secret Information" or any such
     designation employed by the various state or federal statutes. Such
     obligation survives the termination of employment.
 
          6. The compensation regularly and periodically paid Employee in the
     course of said employment by UST includes a component payment, in full, for
     his obligations hereunder. It is understood that UST shall pay all expenses
     incident to obtaining copyrights or patents or trademarks on the
     Improvements and to the execution and recording of assignments and other
     documents incident to security title thereto in UST.
 
          7. It is understood that information presently in the public domain or
     which comes into the public domain without any breach of this Agreement by
     Employee shall not be Proprietary Information, but the fact that UST
     utilizes any such information shall be Proprietary Information.
 
          8. It is further understood that UST may conduct a yearly audit of its
     Proprietary Information and each employee understands that such audit is to
     assure that its Proprietary Information is being maintained as prescribed
     by the procedures established by UST.
 
          9. As any data storage and/or retrieval system such as electronic data
     storage and retrieval system, laser image or image storage and/or retrieval
     system and the like may accumulate and/or provide access to enormous
     amounts of very valuable information including Proprietary Information, and
     further as such information may be dispersed throughout such data storage
     systems, and still further as such information may be manipulated to
     provide significant Proprietary Information retrieved from a combination of
     these stored data, all such data storage systems and information retrieval
     from same must be considered to be based on and to contain Proprietary
     Information. Unless such use and/or manipulation of such information in a
     data storage system is authorized, all such access to and/or manipulation
     of such information is considered to be unauthorized. Any violation of
     access and/or manipulation of such information in a data storage system
     including making a copy, in whatever form, of this information, on premises
     of UST or off premises of UST, is a basis for dismissal unless good cause
     is shown why such use and/or copying was believed to be authorized.
 
          10. In the event Employee's employment with UST will cease, the
     Employee agrees to an exit interview conducted by UST which may cover,
     among other items, any inquiry about Proprietary Information which belongs
     to UST and/or is considered by UST as belonging to it.
<PAGE>   12
 
          11. The terms of this Agreement shall survive the termination of
     Employee's employment by UST and shall be binding upon the Employee's
     heirs, successors and legal representatives.
 
          12. It is also understood that if Employee were to be employed by a
     competitor that Employee may be asked to sign an agreement whereby Employee
     will be required to reiterate and reaffirm the above terms and give a
     positive assurance that up to termination Employee has abided by the terms
     of this Agreement and during the employment with the competitor Employee
     will scrupulously observe and abide by the terms of this Agreement.
 
          13. It is also understood that the term "Proprietary Confidential
     Information" includes any and all information of or relating to UST not
     otherwise publicly available including, without limitation, any such
     information developed by management or UST's agents or representatives
     pertaining to proposals or similar studies or analyses with respect to any
     actions of any manner whatsoever which may be taken in the event of an
     actual or attempted acquisition or change of control of UST.

employees of the Company to increase the profits of the Company, including its

     1.12 "Plan Year" shall be the twelve calendar months of the fiscal year of
the Parent Company.
 
     1.13 "Plan" shall mean the UST Inc. Incentive Compensation Plan set forth
herein, as amended from time to time.
 
                                   SECTION 2.
 
     2.1 Any full-time employee of the Company who is determined by the
Committee to have made a meaningful contribution to the Company for a particular
Plan Year shall be eligible to be a Participant for such Plan Year. Inclusion of
the name of any employee in a list or schedule for distribution of the Fund for
any particular year shall, as to that year, constitute a designation by the
Committee and no further or other act shall be required to establish the
eligibility of an employee.
 
     2.2 Termination of employment prior to the end of a Plan Year for any
reason shall not affect an employee's eligibility for that portion of the year
prior to termination, but if such employee is designated as a Participant for
such Plan Year in accordance with Section 2.1, the share of that Participant
shall be determined as provided in Section 4.7.
 
                                   SECTION 3.
 
                  DETERMINATION OF INCENTIVE COMPENSATION FUND
 
     3.1 The Incentive Compensation Fund shall be the sum of the following
portions of Incentive Plan Income for each Plan Year:
                            1% of the
                            first         $1,000,000
                            2% of the
                            next           1,500,000
                            3% of the
                            next           2,500,000
                            4% of the
                            next           3,500,000
                            5% of amounts
                            over           8,500,000
 
provided, however, that no Fund shall be deemed to have been earned, and none
shall be distributed for any Plan Year, unless (a) a cash dividend shall have
been declared and paid on the common stock of the Parent Company in such year,
and (b) the Incentive Plan Income shall have exceeded 12% of Stockholders'
Equity for that year. A statement of the amount of the Fund shall be prepared
under the direction of and certified by the Controller as soon after the close
of the Plan Year as may conveniently be done, and be delivered to the Committee.
The Nominating and Compensation Committee of the Parent Company's Board of
Directors (the "Compensation Committee") shall certify in a writing prior to the
payment of any Incentive Compensation that the foregoing conditions have been
satisfied.
 
     3.2 Upon receipt of the statement described in Section 3.1 above, based
upon the amount of the Fund as certified therein and subject to the other
provisions of the Plan, including Section 3.3 hereof, the Committee shall with
all reasonable dispatch determine who shall participate and the amount of
Incentive Compensation
<PAGE>   3
 
payable to each Participant in accordance with the terms of the Plan, and shall
thereupon furnish to the Controller a list or schedule showing:
 
          (a) the names of all Participants,
 
          (b) the incentive group, A or B, of each Participant,
 
          (c) the Incentive Weight of each Participant,
 
          (d) the performance points of each Participant,
 
          (e) the adjustment factor applicable to the Participants in each
     incentive group, and
 
          (f) the amount of Incentive Compensation payable to each Participant.
 
     3.3 Subject to applicable provisions of Section 4, the Committee shall for
each Plan Year, with respect to Participants who are "executive officers" (as
defined in Rule 3b-7 issued under Section 3 of the Securities Exchange Act of
1934, as amended) of the Parent Company during such Plan Year (the "Executive
Officers"), recommend the amount of Incentive Compensation payable to each such
Participant and submit its recommendation to the Compensation Committee.
Payments of Incentive Compensation with respect to the Executive Officers shall
be subject to the approval of the Compensation Committee.
 
                                   SECTION 4.
 
                  DISTRIBUTION OF INCENTIVE COMPENSATION FUND
 
     4.1 The Fund shall be divided by the Committee into two portions, for Group
A and Group B Participants, respectively. Such portions for each Plan Year shall
be determined by the Committee, but in no event shall the Group A portion exceed
50% of the Fund.
 
     4.2 The employees eligible to be designated by the Committee, in accordance
with Section 2.1, as Group A Participants for a Plan Year shall be the
employee-directors of the Parent Company, the principal officers of the Parent
Company and such other officers of the Company as the Committee may from time to
time select. All Executive Officers shall be designated as Group A Participants
for each Plan Year.
 
     4.3 The employees eligible to be designated by the Committee, in accordance
with Section 2.1, as Group B Participants for a Plan Year shall be those
employees of the Company other than employees designated as Group A
Participants.
 
     4.4 As to each group and for each Plan Year, without reference to any prior
Plan Year, an Incentive Weight as defined in Section 1.9 above will be
determined for each Participant in such group, taking into account the other
provisions of the Plan and any and all factors deemed to be relevant to the
evaluation of individual performance, including, but not limited to, general
knowledge and repute, personal observations, importance of the individual
employee's duties, responsibilities, complexity of his work, skills required,
attendance record and attitude, performance of duties, attainment of corporate
objectives, and such other grounds for judgment as are deemed appropriate;
Incentive Weights shall be expressed in percentages, but in no event shall they
exceed 40% for any Participant.
 
     4.5 The allocation of the Fund within each group shall be determined by
multiplying the Salary of each Participant in group by the Incentive Weight
determined by the Committee for such Participant. The product thereof shall be
the performance points of such Participant. The total performance points of each
group shall then be compared with the total number of dollars of the Fund
applicable to each group, and an adjustment factor derived therefrom from each
group by dividing the performance points into the number of dollars of the Fund
for the group. Within each group the performance points of each Participant
shall be adjusted by multiplying such points by the adjustment factor for that
group. The performance points as so adjusted shall be the amount of Incentive
Compensation payable to each such Participant in the Plan for that Plan Year.
 
     4.6 Incentive Compensation payments shall be made in cash as soon after the
completion of the several computations as may be practicable, provided, however,
that as to Group A Participants, an election may be made prior to the
commencement of each Plan Year in writing addressed and delivered to the
Chairman of
<PAGE>   4
 
the Committee as to whether or not the Participant desires to receive his
Incentive Compensation when available for distribution or wishes to defer its
payment until a specified date after the date of his retirement. If no such
election is made, payment shall be made currently and not deferred. Any such
deferred payment shall be wholly vested in the Participant upon the final
determination of the amount thereof and in the event of his death prior to
payment shall be paid to the legal representative of his estate, or, in the
event of termination of employment for any reason prior to retirement, shall be
paid within thirty (30) days thereafter to the Participant or to his order. No
interest shall accrue on deferred payments regardless of the period of
deferment.
 
     4.7 In the event an employee who is designated as a Participant for a Plan
Year under Sections 2.1 and 3.2 had terminated employment for any reason during
such Plan Year, he shall not forfeit Incentive Compensation for such Plan Year
but he shall be entitled to receive pro rata compensation according to the
number of whole months of continuous Employment prior to such termination in
that Plan Year.
 
     4.8 Notwithstanding any other provisions of the Plan, in no event shall the
amount of Incentive Compensation payable for any Plan Year to the Chief
Executive Officer of the Company exceed 15% of Fund A; nor shall the amount of
Incentive Compensation payable for any Plan Year to any other Executive Officer
exceed 12% of Fund A, provided that in each case the Compensation Committee
shall have the discretion to award less than the indicated maximum amount. If
less than the indicated maximum amount is allocated to any Executive Officer for
any Plan Year, the excess of the maximum amount over the actual amount of the
award may not be used to increase the maximum award to any other Executive
Officer.
 
                                   SECTION 5
 
                                 ADMINISTRATION
 
     5.1 The Incentive Compensation Plan shall be administered by a Committee of
three (3) to six (6) members, as determined from time to time by the Board,
subject to the provisions of Section 3.3 and applicable provisions of Section 4
hereof. Such members shall be appointed from time to time by the Board, upon
recommendation by the Chief Executive Officer of the Parent Company. Not less
than a majority of the Committee shall be members of the Board.
 
     5.2 The President or Chief Executive Officer of the Parent Company shall be
a member and Chairman of the Committee. The Committee shall select one of its
members to act as Secretary and shall authorize one or more of its members to
execute or deliver any instruments or to make any certificates in behalf of the
Committee.
 
     5.3 Members of the Committee shall serve without special remuneration but
shall be entitled to be reimbursed for reasonable expenses necessarily incurred
in the performance of their duties as Committee members. They shall not be
liable for any acts or omissions to act unless the same are due to their willful
misconduct or gross negligence.
 
     5.4 Committee action may be taken by the concurrence, in assembled meeting
or otherwise, of a simple majority of the full Committee, provided that all
members have been fully informed and given opportunity to record their
concurrence or disagreement. At any meeting of the Committee, a quorum for the
transaction of any business shall consist of a simple majority of the full
number of the Committee regardless of vacancies.
 
     5.5 The Secretary selected by the Committee shall keep full and accurate
minutes of all meetings and records of the actions of the Committee, and these
minutes and records shall be at all times open to inspection by the members of
the Board of Directors. The Secretary shall annually transmit to the Board
certified copies of the statements or schedules described in Sections 3.1 and
3.2 promptly upon completion thereof.
 
     5.6 The Plan is designed to comply with the requirements of Section 162(m)
of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, with respect to "qualified
performance-based compensation" paid to Participants who are "covered
employees," each as defined in such Section 162(m), and shall be interpreted
accordingly.

                                   SECTION 6.
 
               AMENDMENT, TERMINATION OR MODIFICATION OF THE PLAN
 
     6.1 The Plan may be amended from time to time or terminated by the
stockholders of the Parent Company or by the Board of Directors; provided,
however, that no amendment of the Plan shall be made without the approval of
stockholders if such amendment would (i) change the method of calculation of the
Fund, (ii) make less restrictive the existing restrictions on the distribution
of the Fund contained in clauses (a) and (b) of Section 3.1, or (iii) increase
to more than 50% the proportion of the Fund payable for any Plan Year to
employees who are either employee-directors or principal officers of the Parent
Company.
 
     6.2 In the event of a change in the Parent Company's fiscal year, this Plan
shall apply, with appropriate pro rata adjustments, to any intermediate period
not consisting of twelve months, and shall then apply to each fiscal year
following, and the term "Plan Year" shall under such circumstances be deemed to
refer to the Parent Company's fiscal year.
 
     6.3 No employee, Participant or group of employees or Participants shall
have any right or vested interest in the continuation of this Plan at any time,
nor, by being a Participant, have any right or vested interest in continuation
of his employment or of his status as a Participant, or of his rate of
compensation.
 
     6.4 No right or interest of any Participant under this Plan shall be
subject to anticipation, assignment, pledge, or charge, in whole or in part,
either directly or by operation of law or otherwise, including, but without
limitation, execution, levy, garnishment, attachment, pledge, bankruptcy or any
other manner, but excluding devolution by death or mental incompetency, and any
attempt to anticipate, assign, pledge or charge any such right or interest shall
be void and no right or interest of any Participant under this Plan shall be
liable for, or subject to, any obligation or liability or tort of such
Participant. If any Participant shall attempt to anticipate, assign, pledge or
charge (except as specifically provided herein) any of his rights or interests
hereunder or if such rights or interests shall be subjected to execution, levy,
garnishment, attachment, pledge or bankruptcy, then such rights or interests
shall, in the discretion of the Committee, cease and terminate and in that event
the Committee may hold or apply the same or any part thereof to or for the
benefit of such Participant or his estate in such manner and in such proportion
as the Committee may think proper.

                           DIVIDENDS AND STOCK PRICES
 
CASH DIVIDENDS
 
     The Company increased its 1993 cash dividend by 20 percent to an annual
rate of 96 cents per share. Since 1990, the dividend rate has increased 74.5
percent reflecting an average annual increase of 20.4 percent. Total cash
dividends paid by the Company in 1993 were $199.7 million or 57.2 percent of net
earnings. Cash dividends paid to stockholders have exceeded 50 percent of net
earnings in each of the last three years.
 
     In December 1993, the Board of Directors approved a first quarter 1994
dividend of 28 cents per share. This equates to an indicated annual rate of
$1.12 and represents an increase of 16.7 percent. The Company has paid cash
dividends without interruption since 1912. Future dividends depend on many
factors, including internal estimates of future performance and the Company's
need for funds.
 
STOCK PRICES
 
     UST shares are traded on the New York Stock Exchange and the Pacific Stock
Exchange, ticker symbol -- UST.
 
     The number of stockholders of record at December 31, 1993 was 13,601. The

overall sales gain, posting a 13.8 percent increase. Other segment sales were
lower due to the absence of Zig-Zag cigarette papers and related products
resulting from the sale of its distribution rights on March 31, 1993.
 
     Over the last three years, net sales have increased 45.8 percent at an
average annual rate of 13.5 percent.
 
     Cost of products sold decreased 4 percent to $246.4 million. Cost of
products sold for the Tobacco segment was lower due to significant volume
declines for other tobacco products which was partially offset by higher unit
costs and increased unit volume for moist smokeless tobacco. Costs for the Other
segment were lower primarily due to the absence of cigarette papers, while Wine
segment unit costs were higher.
 
     Gross profit increased $81.4 million, or 10.4 percent over 1992 primarily
due to higher selling prices and increased unit volume for moist smokeless
tobacco.
 
     The gross profit percentage rose to 77.8 percent mainly due to the
favorable results for moist smokeless tobacco and volume declines for lower
margin products. The gross profit percentage has increased 3 percentage points
over the last three years.
 
     Selling, advertising and administrative expenses rose 6.2 percent to $299.2
million. Selling and advertising expenses increased for all segments.
Administrative and other expenses were generally lower, with increases in salary
and related costs being offset by lower spending in other areas and gains
recorded on the sale of corporate investments.
 
     Operating income increased 12.8 percent in 1993 to $564.8 million.
 
     The Company realized net interest income as a result of income from cash
equivalent investments exceeding interest expense.
 
     Results for 1993, as compared to 1992, were affected by several
developments. The Company sold its distribution rights for Zig-Zag cigarette
papers and related products on March 31, 1993 for $39 million in cash and
additional consideration based on future earnings for the next ten years. This
transaction resulted in an after-tax gain of $22 million, amounting to 10 cents
per share. The absence of these products in operating results for the remainder
of 1993 reduced primary earnings per share by 2 cents. In addition, the "Omnibus
Budget Reconciliation Act," which increased the statutory corporate federal
income tax rate to 35 percent retroactive to January 1, 1993, reduced primary
earnings per share by 3 cents for the year.
 
     In the first quarter of 1993 the Company adopted Statement of Financial
Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 106, "Employers' Accounting for Postretirement
Benefits Other Than Pensions," and SFAS No. 109, "Accounting for Income Taxes."
As a result of adopting SFAS No. 106 the Company recorded a one-time charge to
net earnings of $32.7 million. The adoption of SFAS No. 109 resulted in an
increase in net earnings of $12.8 million. The cumulative effect of these
accounting changes reduced primary earnings per share by 9 cents for the year.
 
     Profit margins rose to 54.2 percent on earnings before income taxes and the
cumulative effect of accounting changes of $601.8 million. Over the last three
years, earnings before income taxes and the
<PAGE>   2
 
cumulative effect of accounting changes have increased 70.9 percent at an
average annual rate of 19.6 percent, while pretax margins have averaged 49.9
percent.
 
     The overall tax rate for 1993 increased due to the higher statutory
corporate federal income tax rate.
 
     Net earnings increased for the 33rd consecutive year rising 11.7 percent to
$349 million. Primary earnings per share before the cumulative effect of
accounting changes rose to $1.71, a 21.3 percent increase over 1992, and have
increased 74.5 percent over the last three years at an average annual rate of
20.4 percent. Primary earnings per share, after the cumulative effect of
accounting changes, rose to $1.62, a 14.9 percent increase over 1992. Primary
earnings per share have increased 65.3 percent over the last three years at an
average annual rate of 18.3 percent.
 
  1992 COMPARED WITH 1991
 
     Certain amounts reported in 1992 and 1991 have been reclassified to conform
to the 1993 presentation. (See Wine segment for additional information.)
 
     Consolidated net sales rose 14.9 percent to $1.04 billion.
 
     The Tobacco segment accounted for 82.1 percent of the $134.9 million sales
increase. The Wine and Other segments also contributed to the sales increase,
posting gains of 15.5 percent and 19.4 percent, respectively.
 
     Cost of products sold increased 12.9 percent to $256.8 million, primarily
due to increased unit sales and higher unit costs for other tobacco products,
moist smokeless tobacco and wine. Volume gains for businesses in the Other
segment also contributed to the increase.
 
     Gross profit increased $105.7 million, or 15.6 percent over 1991, primarily
due to higher selling prices and increased unit volume for moist smokeless
tobacco.
 
     The gross profit percentage for 1992 rose slightly to 75.3 percent with the
increase of moist smokeless tobacco margins being partially offset by lower
margins for other tobacco products and the Wine segment.
 
     Selling, advertising and administrative expenses rose 11.4 percent to
$281.8 million. Selling and advertising expenses increased in all segments.
Administrative and other expenses were generally higher, primarily due to salary
and related costs.
 
     Interest income resulted as income from cash equivalent investments
exceeded interest expense.
 
     Pretax profit margins rose to 48.4 percent on earnings before taxes of
$502.6 million.
 
     The overall tax rate for 1992 remained stable.
 
     Net earnings increased 17.5 percent to $312.6 million. Primary earnings per
share rose to $1.41, a 19.5 percent increase over 1991.
 
TOBACCO SEGMENT
 
  1993 COMPARED WITH 1992
 
     Tobacco segment sales increased 7.6 percent to $951.6 million and accounted
for 85.7 percent of consolidated revenues. Smokeless tobacco sales increased
11.7 percent to $930.5 million, representing 83.8 percent of consolidated sales.
Other tobacco product sales decreased significantly due to lower unit volume of
imported cigarettes.
 
     The increase in smokeless tobacco sales resulted from higher selling prices
and unit volume gains for moist smokeless tobacco. Unit volume results for both
the year and fourth quarter of 1993 included one less shipping day as compared
with the similar periods in 1992. Domestic unit volume for moist smokeless
tobacco products increased 2.3 percent in 1993 to 611.6 million cans, as
compared with the similar period for 1992, and would have increased 3.1 percent
on an equivalent shipping day basis. Fourth quarter unit volume remained
<PAGE>   3
 
stable on sales of 152 million cans, compared with the similar 1992 period, and
would have increased 3 percent on an equivalent shipping day basis.
 
     Moist smokeless tobacco unit costs increased slightly due to higher leaf
tobacco costs and increased excise taxes imposed January 1, 1993. Cost of sales
for the Tobacco segment were significantly lower due to decreased unit volume
for other tobacco products which have higher unit costs as compared to moist
smokeless tobacco.
 
     Gross profit for the segment rose substantially during 1993. Higher selling
prices and unit volume gains for moist smokeless tobacco were the primary
reasons for the increase.
 
     Selling expenses increased 12.9 percent, primarily due to higher costs
associated with promotional activities as well as higher salaries and increased
expenses for the sales force.
 
     Advertising costs increased significantly as compared with the prior year.
Selling and advertising expenses were directed at the promotion and support of
our moist smokeless tobacco products, including the two new flavors which were
introduced during the year. Administrative expenses were lower as increased
salary and related costs were offset by lower spending in other areas.
 
     Operating profit increased 12.4 percent to $572.1 million.
 
  1992 COMPARED WITH 1991
 
     Tobacco segment sales rose to $884 million for an increase of 14.3 percent
and accounted for 85 percent of consolidated revenues. Smokeless tobacco sales
increased 13.8 percent to $832.9 million, and represented 80.1 percent of
consolidated sales. Other tobacco product sales increased significantly due to
higher unit volume of imported cigarettes.
 
     The increase in smokeless tobacco sales resulted from higher selling prices
and unit volume gains for moist smokeless tobacco. Domestic unit volume for
moist smokeless tobacco products increased 3.7 percent in 1992, to 597.8 million
cans.
 
     Moist smokeless tobacco unit costs increased slightly due to higher leaf
tobacco costs. Cost of sales for other tobacco products were substantially
higher, primarily due to volume gains and higher unit costs.
 
     Gross profit for the segment rose substantially during 1992 as a result of
higher selling prices and unit volume gains for moist smokeless tobacco.
 
     Selling expenses increased 6.9 percent, primarily due to higher salaries
and increased expenses for the sales force and higher costs associated with
promotional activities. Advertising costs increased significantly as compared
with the prior year. Selling and advertising expenses were aimed at supporting
and expanding consumer awareness of our moist smokeless tobacco products.
Administrative expenses were higher primarily due to increased salary and
related costs.
 
     Operating profit increased 16 percent to $508.8 million.
 
WINE SEGMENT
 
  1993 COMPARED WITH 1992
 
     Wine segment revenue increased 13.8 percent to $80.2 million and accounted
for 7.2 percent of consolidated sales. Higher case volume for premium wine
accounted for the increase. Case volume for premium wine increased 14.4 percent,
while overall case volume for the Wine segment increased 7.6 percent. Chateau
Ste. Michelle and Columbia Crest, our two leading brands of premium wine,
accounted for approximately 69 percent of total wine revenue.
 
     Overall, unit costs increased primarily due to higher grape costs resulting
from low harvest yields in 1991 and prior years.
<PAGE>   4
 
     The Company uses grapes both harvested from its own vineyards and purchased
from regional independent growers in its wine production. For the second
consecutive year, the 1993 grape harvest yields experienced by the Company and
throughout the region were exceptional. Total grape tonnage harvested and
purchased in 1993 was significantly higher than in 1992 resulting in increased
inventory levels. The outstanding harvest in 1993 will continue to assist the
Company in meeting its expanding requirements for premium brands and will have a
favorable effect on future unit costs.
 
     Gross profit for the Wine segment increased 10.7 percent primarily as a
result of an increase in premium wine case volume partially offset by higher
unit costs.
 
     Selling, advertising and administrative expenses increased in 1993. Selling
expenses increased primarily to support higher volume levels of premium brands.
 
     Advertising expenses were higher and were aimed at supporting and expanding
national brand awareness of our existing premium wines and recently introduced
products.
 
     Administrative and other expenses were slightly lower as compared to 1992,
as higher salary and related costs were offset by lower spending in other areas.
 
     The Wine segment recorded an operating profit of $6.1 million in 1993, an
increase of 28.4 percent over 1992.
 
  1992 COMPARED WITH 1991
 
     In 1993, the Company reclassified certain discounts and allowances which
were previously included in selling expense, to sales and cost of sales, to
better reflect competitive market conditions. All prior period amounts have been
reclassified to conform to the 1993 presentation.
 
     Wine segment revenue increased 15.5 percent to $70.5 million and accounted
for 6.8 percent of consolidated sales. Higher case volume for premium wine
accounted for the increase. Overall case volume for the Wine segment increased
12.3 percent, while case volume for premium wine increased 14 percent.
 
     Overall, unit costs increased primarily due to higher grape costs resulting
from low harvest yields in prior years.
 
     Total grape tonnage harvested and purchased in 1992 was higher than in
1991, resulting in increased inventory levels which will provide lower future
unit costs. However, unit costs for 1993 will continue to reflect higher costs
due to lower harvest yields in prior years.
 
     Gross profit for the Wine segment increased 6.9 percent primarily as a
result of an increase in premium wine case volume.
 
     Selling, advertising and administrative expenses increased in 1992. Selling
expenses increased primarily due to promotions and expenses incurred to support
higher volume levels of premium brands.
 
     Advertising expenses increased and were focused on supporting and expanding
national brand awareness of Columbia Crest.
 
     Administrative expenses increased due to higher salary and related costs.
 
     The Wine segment recorded an operating profit of $4.8 million in 1992.
 
OTHER SEGMENT
 
  1993 COMPARED WITH 1992
 
     Other segment sales were $81.5 million, a 7 percent decrease from 1992, and
accounted for 7.3 percent of consolidated sales. Other segment sales were lower
due to the sale of the distribution rights for Zig-Zag cigarette papers and
related products on March 31, 1993. The absence of these products for the
remainder of 1993 had an adverse effect on the operating results for the Other
segment and will continue to have an adverse effect in the first quarter of
1994.
<PAGE>   5
 
     Operating profit was significantly lower for tobacco-related products due
to the sale of the cigarette paper business, but was partially offset by
favorable results for other businesses. Overall, the Other segment recorded an
operating profit of $9.2 million in 1993.
 
  1992 COMPARED WITH 1991
 
     Other segment sales rose 19.4 percent to $87.6 million and accounted for
8.4 percent of consolidated sales. Volume gains and higher selling prices for
Zig-Zag cigarette papers and related products accounted for the majority of the
increase. Operating profit for these tobacco-related products, which increased
significantly in 1992, were partially offset by losses recorded for other
businesses. The Other segment recorded an operating profit of $9.6 million in
1992.
 
                               HEALTH CARE REFORM
 
     In October 1993, the Clinton Administration announced the Health Security
Act, which provides for, among other things, increased federal excise taxes on
all tobacco products, including moist snuff. The proposed federal excise tax
rate on moist snuff would increase from 36 cents per pound to $12.86 per pound.
The Company intends to vigorously oppose this proposed increase. The debate over
this health care proposal, as well as other alternatives which do not include
excise tax increases, is expected to continue for many months in Congress.
Accordingly, the Company is not able to predict the amount, if any, by which the
federal excise tax rate may increase, or assess the future effect that any such
increase may have on the sale of its tobacco products.
 
                              FINANCIAL CONDITION
 
SOURCES AND USES OF CASH -- OPERATIONS
 
     Cash provided by operating activities is the major source of funds
available to the Company. Cash from operations increased to $367.6 million in
1993, as compared to $288.8 million in 1992 and $272 million in 1991. The
primary reason for the increase was higher earnings generated by the Tobacco
segment.
 
     Significant inventories of leaf tobacco are required primarily in
connection with our smokeless tobacco products. During the last three years,
$158.1 million was used for the purchase of leaf tobacco. In addition, the cost
of grapes harvested and purchased totaled $61.6 million over the last three
years.
 
INVESTING ACTIVITIES
 
     Net cash used in investing activities was $17.3 million in 1993. Purchases
of property, plant and equipment over the last three years totaled $122.2
million.
 
     Major areas of capital spending from 1991 through 1993 were:
 
     Tobacco segment
 
     o Manufacturing, processing and packaging equipment
 
     o Automobiles for the sales force
 
     o Building renovations
 
     Wine segment
 
     o Storage capacity and processing equipment
 
     o New facilities and building renovations
 
     o Irrigation and vineyard development
<PAGE>   6
 
     Other segment
 
     o Equipment
 
     o Building additions and renovations
 
     Shared assets
 
     o Transportation equipment -- primarily aircraft
 
     o Headquarters, conference and training facility renovations
 
     In 1994, the Company's capital program is expected to approximate $38
million, and will primarily include improvements to the tobacco processing and
manufacturing operations and the expansion of wine processing and storage
facilities.
 
     On March 31, 1993, the Company sold its distribution rights for Zig-Zag
cigarette papers and related products for $39 million in cash and additional
consideration based on future earnings.
 
FINANCING ACTIVITIES
 
     Other significant sources and uses of cash over the last three years have
included long-term borrowings, the issuance of common stock, stock repurchases
and cash dividends. During the fourth quarter of 1993, the Company borrowed $40
million under a short-term line of credit with a bank and used the proceeds to
repurchase additional shares of its common stock. In January 1994, the Company
entered into a revolving credit and term loan agreement for $50 million with the
same bank and converted the outstanding amount of $40 million to long-term debt.
The Company intends to borrow the additional $10 million in 1994 to increase the
funds available for the stock repurchase program. (See Revolving Credit and Term
Loan Agreement and Short-Term Lines of Credit Note.)
 
     Common stock was issued upon the exercise of options granted under the
Company's stock option plans. Options are granted to employees who have made or
who are expected to make contributions to the growth of the Company. The Company
receives income tax benefits upon the exercise of certain of these options.
Since 1990, funds received from the exercise of options, together with these tax
benefits, totaled $203.4 million.
 
     During 1993, the Company continued its program to repurchase shares of its
common stock as authorized by the Board of Directors. The current program
authorizes the Company to repurchase up to 40 million shares of its common stock
from time to time in open market or negotiated transactions to be used in
connection with employee benefit programs and other corporate purposes.
 
     During 1993, the Company repurchased 8.5 million shares at a cost of $236.7
million and as of December 31, 1993, 6.4 million shares remained to be
repurchased under the current program. The Company anticipates repurchasing
these remaining shares in 1994.
 
     It is the Company's philosophy that its stockholders should benefit
directly from increases in net earnings. Accordingly, the Company has regularly
increased dividend payments as earnings have risen. During the last three years,
cash dividends distributed to stockholders amounted to $507.3 million, totaling
54.7 percent of net earnings for the period.
 
LIQUIDITY
 
     Uses of cash exceeded sources of cash by $11 million in 1993. The Company
anticipates that cash generated from operating activities will meet most of its
requirements in 1994. Seasonal purchases of leaf tobacco occasionally require
the Company to use short-term borrowings in the form of commercial paper, when
necessary, to augment cash generated by operating activities. In 1993 sufficient
cash was generated to meet these requirements and short-term borrowings were
limited. The Company anticipates that leaf tobacco purchases in 1994 will
approximate $55.4 million as compared to $54.1 million for 1993.
 
     The ratio of current assets to current liabilities (current ratio) at
December 31, 1993 was 3.1 to 1 and has averaged 3.5 to 1 over the last three
years. Cash used in investing and financing activities, along with an increase
in income taxes payable, reduced the current ratio from prior years. However,
the Company continues
<PAGE>   7
 
to maintain a strong liquidity position. Further enhancing this position is the
fact that certain inventories are carried at costs computed under the LIFO
method. The average costs of these inventories was $39.6 million more than the
amount at which they are carried in the Consolidated Statement of Financial
Position at December 31, 1993.
 
     The Company believes that adequate credit facilities are available through
committed short-term credit lines. The Company has available short-term lines of
credit with domestic and foreign banks totaling $100 million at December 31,
1993. The lines of credit are generally committed for a one-year period expiring
mid-1994 and provide for borrowing at prime rates. These arrangements require
commitment fees which are not significant. These facilities can be used as bank
financing or as support for commercial paper borrowing. The commercial paper
market is expected to continue as an attractive source of funds. The Company has
the highest ratings available on its commercial paper.
 
     The Company intends to maintain appropriate facilities to ensure access to
credit markets providing sufficient financial resources and operational
flexibility.
 
CAPITAL RESOURCES
 
     The Company had $40 million of long-term debt outstanding at December 31,
1993. The percentage of long-term debt outstanding to stockholders' equity is
8.6 percent. The Company had no short-term debt outstanding at December 31,
1993.
 
     Stockholders' equity decreased in 1993, as the effects of the stock
repurchase program and dividend payments exceeded the effects of net earnings
and common stock issued under the Company's stock option plans.
 
     The return on average stockholders' equity has increased by 24.6 percentage
points to 71.3 percent over the last three years.
<PAGE>   8
 
                           DIVIDENDS AND STOCK PRICES
 
CASH DIVIDENDS
 
     The Company increased its 1993 cash dividend by 20 percent to an annual
rate of 96 cents per share. Since 1990, the dividend rate has increased 74.5
percent reflecting an average annual increase of 20.4 percent. Total cash
dividends paid by the Company in 1993 were $199.7 million or 57.2 percent of net
earnings. Cash dividends paid to stockholders have exceeded 50 percent of net
earnings in each of the last three years.
 
     In December 1993, the Board of Directors approved a first quarter 1994
dividend of 28 cents per share. This equates to an indicated annual rate of
$1.12 and represents an increase of 16.7 percent. The Company has paid cash
dividends without interruption since 1912. Future dividends depend on many
factors, including internal estimates of future performance and the Company's
need for funds.
 
STOCK PRICES
 
     UST shares are traded on the New York Stock Exchange and the Pacific Stock
Exchange, ticker symbol -- UST.
 
     The number of stockholders of record at December 31, 1993 was 13,601. The
following table sets forth dividends paid per share and the high and low market
prices for the year and each quarter of 1993 and 1992.

                   NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
 
SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES
 
  CONSOLIDATION
 
     The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company
and all of its subsidiaries after the elimination of intercompany accounts and
transactions. Investments in a limited partnership and 50 percent or less owned
companies, accounted for by the equity method, are carried at amounts equal to
the Company's equity in the underlying assets of such entities.
 
     Certain amounts in the Wine segment which were previously included in
selling, general and administrative expenses have been reclassified to net sales
and cost of products sold to conform to the 1993 presentation.
 
  FAIR VALUE OF FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS
 
     The estimated fair value of amounts reported in the consolidated financial
statements have been determined by using available market information and
appropriate valuation methodologies. All current assets and current liabilities
are carried at their fair value, because of their short-term nature. The fair
value of long-term investments, notes receivable and long-term debt approximate
their carrying value.
 
  INVENTORIES
 
     Inventories are stated at lower of cost or market. The major portion of
leaf tobacco and briar inventory costs is determined by the last-in, first-out
(LIFO) method. The cost of the remaining inventories is determined by the
first-in, first-out (FIFO) and average cost methods. Leaf tobacco and wine
inventories are included in current assets as a standard industry practice,
notwithstanding the fact that such inventories are carried for several years for
the purpose of curing and aging.
 
  PROPERTY, PLANT AND EQUIPMENT
 
     Property, plant and equipment are carried at cost less allowances for
depreciation computed by the straight line method.
 
  GOODWILL
 
     Goodwill represents the excess of cost over the fair value of net assets of
businesses acquired. Unamortized goodwill is included in other assets and is
being amortized ratably over periods from ten to forty years ending in 2026.
 
  INCOME TAXES
 
     Income taxes are provided on all revenue and expense items included in the
Consolidated Statement of Earnings regardless of the period in which such items
are recognized for income tax purposes, except for items representing permanent
differences between pretax accounting income and taxable income. Effective
January 1, 1993, the Company adopted Statement of Financial Accounting Standards
(SFAS) No. 109, "Accounting for Income Taxes," which requires a change in the
method of accounting for income taxes from the deferred method to the liability
method. (See Income Taxes Note for the effects of this change.)
 
  POSTRETIREMENT BENEFITS OTHER THAN PENSIONS
 
     Effective January 1, 1993, the Company adopted Statement of Financial
Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 106, "Employers' Accounting for Postretirement
Benefits Other Than Pensions." This standard requires the accrual basis of
accounting for postretirement benefits. Postretirement benefit costs prior to
adoption of SFAS No. 106 were accounted for on a pay-as-you-go (cash) basis.
(See Postretirement Benefits Other Than Pensions Note for the effects of this
change.)

           NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS -- (CONTINUED)
 
  EARNINGS PER SHARE
 
     Primary earnings per share are calculated by dividing net earnings by the
weighted average number of common and common equivalent shares outstanding
during the period. Common equivalent shares are shares which would be issuable
upon the exercise of outstanding stock options, reduced by the number of shares
which are assumed to be purchased by the Company from the resulting proceeds at
the average market price during the period.
 
     For the fully diluted earnings per share calculation, shares are assumed to
be purchased by the Company at the higher of the average or period-end price and
may include additional dilutive options.

REVOLVING CREDIT AND TERM LOAN AGREEMENT AND SHORT-TERM LINES OF CREDIT
 
     During the fourth quarter of 1993, the Company borrowed $40 million under a
$50 million short-term line of credit which in January 1994 was converted into a
revolving credit and term loan. The current interest rate is 3.5 percent and the
agreement expires in January 2000.
 
     The terms of the agreement provide for a three-year revolving line of
credit. At the Company's option, any balance outstanding thereafter may be
converted into a three-year term loan. Under the terms of the agreement, the
Company may borrow funds and elect either the "Base Rate," "Money Market" or
"Eurodollar" interest rates. Principal repayments are optional during the
revolving credit period, while 36 equal monthly installments are required during
the term loan period. The Company is required to pay a commitment fee of 1/8 of
1 percent per annum on the $50 million commitment during the credit term.
 
     Certain provisions of this agreement require the maintenance of tangible
net worth levels as well as certain financial ratios.
 
     At December 31, 1993, this amount was classified as long-term debt in the
Consolidated Statement of Financial Position.
 
     In addition, the Company has available short-term lines of credit with
domestic and foreign banks totaling $100 million and $95 million at December 31,
1993 and 1992, respectively. The lines of credit are generally committed for a
one-year period expiring mid-1994, and provide for borrowing at prime rates.
These arrangements require commitment fees which are not significant.
 
OTHER LIABILITIES
 
     Other liabilities include the noncurrent portion of the net pension
liabilities (see Employee Benefit and Compensation Plans Note) for 1993 and 1992
of $30.9 million and $26.1 million, respectively.
 
CAPITAL STOCK
 
     The Company has two classes of capital stock, preferred stock and common
stock. Preferred stock carries a par value of $.10 and no shares have been
issued. Common stock carries a $.50 par value. Authorized preferred stock is 10
million shares and authorized common stock is 600 million shares.
 
     In 1993, the Company repurchased 8,467,000 of its shares pursuant to a
stock repurchase program authorized by the Board of Directors on January 1,
1990. The program allows the Company to repurchase up to 40 million shares of
its common stock from time to time in open market or negotiated transactions to
be used in connection with employee benefit programs and other corporate
purposes. As of December 31, 1993, 6.4 million shares remained to be repurchased
under the current program.
 
     Common stock issued and outstanding at December 31, 1993 and 1992 was
204,756,636 shares and 211,036,936 shares, respectively.
 
     Events causing changes in the issued and outstanding shares are described
in the Consolidated Statement of Changes in Stockholders' Equity.
 
STOCK OPTIONS
 
     The Company maintains two stock option plans, the 1992 and 1982 Stock
Option Plans. At December 31, 1993, 9,205,400 shares were available for grant
under the 1992 plan, while no shares were available under the 1982 plan. Under
the plans, options may be granted at not less than the fair market value on the
date of grant. Under the 1992 Stock Option Plan, options first become
exercisable, in ratable installments or otherwise, over a period of one to five
years from the date of grant and may be exercised up to a maximum of 10 years
from date of grant using various payment methods.
 
     Receivables from the exercise of options in the amount of $17.4 million in
1993, $17.2 million in 1992 and $12.5 million in 1991 have been deducted from
stockholders' equity.

EMPLOYEE BENEFIT AND COMPENSATION PLANS
 
     The Company and its subsidiaries maintain a number of noncontributory
defined benefit pension plans covering substantially all employees over age 21
with at least one year of service. The Company's plan for salaried employees
provides pension benefits based on their highest three-year average
compensation. The Company's funding policy for this plan is to contribute an
amount sufficient to meet or exceed ERISA minimum requirements. All other funded
plans base benefits on the employee's compensation in each year of employment.
The Company's funding policy for these plans is generally to contribute the
annual normal cost plus the amount required to amortize unfunded liabilities
over 20 years from the date established. The Company also maintains unfunded
plans providing pension and additional benefits for certain employees.
 
     The assumptions used to determine expense for 1993, 1992 and 1991 were:

     For 1993 and 1992, the net pension assets of $23.5 million and $21.4
million, respectively, consist of prepaid pension costs and are included in
other assets. The noncurrent portion of the net liabilities for 1993 and 1992 of
$33.8 million and $28 million, respectively, are included in other liabilities.
 
     For pension plans whose accumulated benefits exceed assets at December 31,
1993, the Consolidated Statement of Financial Position reflects an additional
minimum liability of $11.5 million: an intangible asset of $4.3 million included
in other assets and a reduction of retained earnings of $4.8 million, which is
net of deferred tax benefits of $2.4 million. At December 31, 1992, the
Consolidated Statement of Financial Position included an additional minimum
liability of $9.6 million: an intangible asset of $4.8 million and a reduction
of retained earnings of $3.2 million, which is net of deferred tax benefits of
$1.6 million.
 
     Plan assets include marketable equity securities (including common stock of
the Company having a market value of $35.5 million as of December 31, 1993 and
$45.8 million as of December 31, 1992) and corporate and government debt
securities.
 
     The discount rate used in determining the present value of benefit
obligations was 7 percent for 1993 and 8 percent for 1992.
 
     The Company sponsors a defined contribution plan (Employees' Savings Plan)
covering substantially all of its employees. The plan requires one year of
service prior to eligibility for participation. Company

contributions are based upon participant contributions. The expense was $3.6
million in 1993, $3.4 million in 1992 and $3.2 million in 1991.
 
     The Company has an Incentive Compensation Plan which provides for incentive
payments to designated employees based on stated percentages of net income as
defined in the plan. Expenses under the plan amounted to $28.8 million for 1993,
$26.3 million for 1992 and $22.2 million for 1991.
 
POSTRETIREMENT BENEFITS OTHER THAN PENSIONS
 
     The Company and certain of its subsidiaries maintain a number of
postretirement welfare benefit plans which provide certain medical and life
insurance benefits to substantially all full-time employees who have attained
certain age and service requirements upon retirement. The health care benefits
are subject to deductibles, co-insurance and in some cases flat dollar
contributions which vary by plan, age and service at retirement. All life
insurance coverage is noncontributory. The welfare plans are not funded.
 
     Effective January 1, 1993, the Company adopted Statement of Financial
Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 106, "Employers' Accounting for Postretirement
Benefits Other Than Pensions." SFAS No. 106 requires the Company to accrue the
expected cost of providing postretirement benefits as an employee renders
service. Prior to the change costs were charged to expense on a pay-as-you-go
(cash) basis.
 
     The Company elected to immediately recognize the accumulated postretirement
benefit obligation of $50.8 million through a one-time cumulative effect
adjustment to earnings of $32.7 million, net of income taxes. The liability is
stated separately in the Consolidated Statement of Financial Position.
 
     The following table sets forth the combined status of the plans at December
31, 1993:

     Postretirement benefit expense was $7.3 million in 1993, $1.6 million in
1992 and $.9 million in 1991. The net periodic postretirement benefit cost for
1993 included the following components:

</TABLE>
 
     The rate of increase in per capita costs of covered health care benefits is
assumed to be 12.3 percent for 1994 and decrease gradually to 5 percent by the
year 2008 and remain at that level thereafter. The health care cost trend rate
assumption has a significant effect on the amounts reported. To illustrate,
increasing the assumed health care cost trend rates by 1 percentage point in
each year would increase the accumulated postretirement benefit obligation as of
December 31, 1993 by approximately $8 million and the 1993 net periodic
postretirement benefit cost by approximately $1.5 million.
 
     The weighted average discount rate used in determining the accumulated
postretirement benefit obligation was 7 percent at December 31, 1993.

INCOME TAXES
 
     Effective January 1, 1993, the Company adopted Statement of Financial
Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 109, "Accounting for Income Taxes," which
requires a change in the method of accounting for income taxes from the deferred
method to the liability method. The Company reflected this change through a
cumulative effect adjustment which increased net earnings and reduced deferred
tax liabilities reported in the Consolidated Statement of Financial Position by
$12.8 million.
 
     Deferred income taxes reflect the net tax effects of temporary differences
between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial reporting
purposes and the amounts used for income tax purposes.
 
     Significant components of the Company's deferred tax liabilities and assets
as of December 31, 1993 are as follows:

     The current tax provisions do not reflect $15.4 million, $52.5 million and
$29.8 million for 1993, 1992 and 1991, respectively, of tax benefits arising
from the exercise of stock options. These amounts were credited directly to
additional paid-in capital.
 
     The deferred tax provision for 1993 includes the benefit of $18.1 million
resulting from the adoption of SFAS No. 106. In addition, the deferred tax
provisions for 1993, 1992 and 1991 do not reflect the respective tax effects of
$.8 million, $(.6) million and $.4 million, resulting from the minimum pension
liability adjustment required by SFAS No. 87, "Employers' Accounting for
Pensions."
 
     The 1993 "Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act" increased the statutory
corporate federal income tax rate to 35 percent retroactive to January 1, 1993.

</TABLE>
 
     The first quarter of 1993 includes a pretax gain of $35 million, amounting
to 10 cents per share, from the sale of a tobacco-related business. This gain
was offset by the cumulative effect of accounting changes as a result of the
adoption of SFAS No. 106 and SFAS No. 109, which resulted in a decrease in net
earnings of $19.8 million, or 9 cents per share.
 
     Certain amounts previously included in selling, general and administrative
expenses have been reclassified to net sales and cost of products sold in both
years.
 
INDUSTRY SEGMENT DATA
 
     The Company's industry segments are Tobacco, Wine and Other. The Company
operates primarily in the tobacco industry and also produces and markets a
number of nontobacco products. Tobacco segment sales are principally to a large
number of wholesalers and chain stores which are widely dispersed. In 1993,
sales to one wholesale customer accounted for approximately 16 percent of
Tobacco segment sales.
 
     The Company operates primarily in the United States; foreign operations and
export sales are not significant. Intersegment sales are accounted for at cost.
 
     Operating profit is total revenue less operating expenses excluding
corporate expenses, net interest income and gain on disposal of product line.
Identifiable assets by segment include both assets directly identified with
those operations and an allocable share of jointly used assets. Corporate assets
consist primarily of cash and cash equivalents, other long-term investments and
an allocation of property, plant and equipment associated with nonsegment
activities.
 
     Net sales for the Wine segment for 1992 and 1991 have been restated to
conform to the 1993 presentation.

OTHER MATTERS
 
     In January 1992, the Company was named as a defendant in an amended
complaint against the major cigarette manufacturers and others. The action
purportedly is brought on behalf of flight attendants who have allegedly
sustained physical, psychological and emotional injuries as a result of exposure
to environmental tobacco smoke on airplanes. On May 19, 1992, the Court
dismissed the class action allegations in plaintiffs' amended complaint.
Plaintiffs filed a notice of appeal from the Court's dismissal on June 17, 1992
and this appeal has not been decided. The Company has had only limited
involvement with cigarettes. Prior to 1985, the Company manufactured some
cigarette products which had a de minimis market share, and the Company is
indemnified for the small volume of imported cigarettes which it currently
distributes. The Company believes that the action is without merit, intends to
defend it vigorously and does not believe it will result in any material
liability to the Company.
 
     On March 31, 1993, the Company sold its distribution rights for Zig-Zag
cigarette papers and related products for $39 million in cash and additional
consideration based on future earnings for the next ten years. The transaction
resulted in a pretax gain of $35 million, amounting to 10 cents per share.

                 REPORT OF ERNST & YOUNG, INDEPENDENT AUDITORS
 
To the Directors and Stockholders
UST Inc.
 
     We have audited the accompanying consolidated statement of financial
position of UST Inc. as of December 31, 1993 and 1992, and the related
consolidated statements of earnings, changes in stockholders' equity, and cash
flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 1993. These
financial statements are the responsibility of the Company's management. Our
responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements based on
our audits.
 
     We conducted our audits in accordance with generally accepted auditing
standards. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material
misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting
the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. An audit also includes
assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by
management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation.
We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.
 
     In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present fairly,
in all material respects, the consolidated financial position of UST Inc. at
December 31, 1993 and 1992, and the consolidated results of its operations and
its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 1993
in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles.
 
     As discussed in the notes to the financial statements, in 1993 the Company
changed its methods of accounting for Income Taxes and Postretirement Benefits
Other Than Pensions.
