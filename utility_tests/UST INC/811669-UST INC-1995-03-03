                                     PART I
 
ITEM 1 -- BUSINESS
 
GENERAL
 
     UST Inc. was formed on December 23, 1986 as a Delaware corporation.
Pursuant to a reorganization approved by stockholders at the 1987 Annual
Meeting, United States Tobacco Company (originally incorporated in 1911) became
a wholly owned subsidiary of UST Inc. on May 5, 1987. UST Inc., through its
subsidiaries (collectively "Registrant" unless the context otherwise requires),
is engaged in manufacturing and marketing consumer products in the following
industry segments:
 
          Tobacco Products: Registrant's primary activities are manufacturing
     and marketing smokeless tobacco (snuff and chewing tobacco) and marketing
     other tobacco products.
 
          Wine: Registrant produces and markets wine.
 
          Other: The international and video entertainment operations as well as
     certain miscellaneous businesses are included in this segment. Registrant
     also produces or imports and markets certain other products such as
     smokers' accessories and operates certain commercial agricultural
     properties.
 
INDUSTRY SEGMENT DATA
 
     Registrant hereby incorporates by reference the Consolidated Industry
Segment Data pertaining to the years 1992 through 1994 set forth on page 32 of
its Annual Report to stockholders for the fiscal year ended December 31, 1994
("Annual Report"), which page is included as Exhibit 13.1.
 
                                        1
<PAGE>   3
 
                                TOBACCO PRODUCTS
 
PRINCIPAL PRODUCTS
 
     Registrant's principal smokeless tobacco products and brand names are as
follows:
 
          Moist -- COPENHAGEN, SKOAL LONG CUT, SKOAL, SKOAL BANDITS
 
          Dry -- BRUTON, CC, RED SEAL
 
          Chewing -- WB CUT
 
     It has been claimed that the use of tobacco products may be harmful to
health. To the best of Registrant's knowledge, unresolved controversy continues
to exist among scientists concerning the claims made about tobacco and health.
In 1986, federal legislation was enacted regulating smokeless tobacco products
by, inter alia, requiring health warning notices on smokeless tobacco packages
and advertising and prohibiting the advertising of smokeless tobacco products on
electronic media. A federal excise tax was imposed in 1986, which was increased
in 1991 and 1993. The Health Security Act announced by the Clinton
Administration in 1993 sought, inter alia, a significant federal excise tax
increase on moist smokeless and other tobacco products. Also, in recent years,
proposals have been made at the federal level for additional regulation of
tobacco products including, inter alia, the requirement of additional warning
notices, the disallowance of advertising and promotion expenses as deductions
under federal tax law, a significant increase of federal excise taxes, a ban or
further restriction of all advertising and promotion, regulation of
environmental tobacco smoke and increased regulation of the manufacturing and
marketing of tobacco products by new or existing federal agencies. Substantially
similar proposals will likely be considered in 1995. In recent years, various
state and local governments continued the regulation of tobacco products,
including, inter alia, the imposition of significantly higher taxes, sampling
and advertising bans or restrictions, regulation of environmental tobacco smoke
and anti-tobacco advertising campaigns. Additional state and local legislative
and regulatory actions will likely be considered in 1995. Registrant is unable
to assess the future effects these various actions may have on its tobacco
business.
 
RAW MATERIALS
 
     Except as noted below, raw materials essential to Registrant's business are
generally purchased in domestic markets under competitive conditions.
 
     In 1994, Registrant increased its purchases of dark fired, burley and dark
air cured tobaccos ("tobacco") primarily from domestic sources. In 1994
purchases from foreign suppliers declined, and continued to decline as a
percentage of total tobacco purchased. Such foreign suppliers were located in
Canada and Italy. Various factors, including a failure of domestic tobacco
production to continue to increase, may require Registrant to purchase
additional amounts of tobacco from foreign sources in order to meet future
requirements. Tobaccos used in the manufacture of smokeless tobacco products
must be processed and aged by Registrant for a period of two to four years prior
to their use.
 
     Registrant or its suppliers purchase certain flavoring components used in
Registrant's tobacco products from foreign sources.
 
     At the present time, Registrant has no reason to believe that its future
raw material requirements for its tobacco products will not be satisfied.
However, the continuing availability and the cost of tobacco from both domestic
and foreign sources is dependent upon a variety of factors which cannot be
predicted, including weather, growing conditions, disease, local planting
decisions, overall market demands and other factors.
 
WORKING CAPITAL
 
     The principal portion of Registrant's operating cash requirements relates
to its need to maintain significant inventories of leaf tobacco, primarily for
manufacturing of smokeless tobacco products, and its need to age and cure
certain of these tobaccos for periods of up to four years prior to use.
 
                                        2

CUSTOMERS
 
     Registrant markets tobacco products throughout the United States
principally to chain stores and tobacco and grocery wholesalers. Approximately
31% of Registrant's gross sales of tobacco products are made to five customers,
one of which accounts for more than 10% of Registrant's consolidated revenue.
Registrant has maintained satisfactory relationships with these customers for
many years.
 
COMPETITIVE CONDITIONS
 
     The tobacco manufacturing industry in the United States is composed of at
least four domestic companies larger than Registrant and many smaller ones. The
larger companies concentrate on the manufacture and marketing of cigarettes; one
also manufactures and markets smokeless tobacco products. Registrant is a well
established and major factor in the smokeless tobacco sector of the overall
tobacco market. Consequently, Registrant competes actively with both larger and
smaller companies in the marketing of its tobacco products. Registrant's
principal methods of competition in the marketing of its tobacco products
include quality, advertising, promotion, sampling, price, product recognition
and distribution.
 
                                      WINE
 
     Registrant is an established producer of premium varietal and blended
wines. CHATEAU STE. MICHELLE and COLUMBIA CREST varietal table wines and DOMAINE
STE. MICHELLE sparkling wine are produced by Registrant in the state of
Washington and marketed throughout the United States. Registrant also produces
and markets two California premium wines under the labels of VILLA MT. EDEN and
CONN CREEK. Approximately 49% of Registrant's wine sales are made to nine
distributors, no one of which accounts for more than 22% of total wine sales.
Substantially all wines are sold through state-licensed distributors with whom
Registrant maintains satisfactory relationships.
 
     It has been claimed that the use of alcohol beverages may be harmful to
health. To the best of Registrant's knowledge, unresolved controversy continues
to exist among scientists concerning the claims made about alcohol beverages and
health. In 1988, federal legislation was enacted regulating alcohol beverages by
requiring health warning notices on alcohol beverages. Effective in 1991, the
federal excise tax on wine was increased from $.17 a gallon to $1.07 a gallon
for those manufacturers that produce more than 250,000 gallons a year, such as
Registrant. In recent years at the federal level, proposals were made for
additional regulation of alcohol beverages including, inter alia, an excise tax
increase, modification of the required health warning notices and the regulation
of labeling, advertising and packaging. Substantially similar proposals will
likely be considered in 1995. Also in recent years, increased regulation of
alcohol beverages by various states included, inter alia, the imposition of
higher taxes, the requirement of health warning notices and the regulation of
advertising and packaging. Additional state and local legislative and regulatory
actions affecting the marketing of alcohol beverages will likely be considered
during 1995. Registrant is unable to assess the future effects these regulatory
and other actions may have on the sale of its wines.
 
     Registrant uses grapes harvested from its own vineyards, as well as grapes
purchased from independent growers located primarily in Washington State. Grape
harvest yields experienced by Registrant and throughout Washington State in 1994
continue to be adequate to meet requirements for premium varietal wines. From
time to time adverse weather conditions have significantly affected grape
harvests from Washington State. Should any vineyards be destroyed as a result of
such conditions, new vineyards generally require five to six years to provide
full yields. At the present time, Registrant has no reason to believe that its
future raw material requirements for its wine products will not be satisfied.
 
     Registrant's principal competition comes from many larger, well-established
national companies, as well as many smaller wine producers. Registrant's
principal methods of competition include quality, price, consumer and trade wine
tastings, competitive wine judging and advertising. Registrant is a minor factor
in the total nationwide business of producing wines.
 
     Registrant concentrates its marketing efforts on premium varietal table
wines and sparkling wines. The future of Registrant's wine business will be
dependent on sales, price and volume growth for premium varietal wines, the
success of new products and adequate grape harvest yields from Washington State.

                                     OTHER
 
     Included in this segment for 1994 are the international operations, video
entertainment business, pipes, smokers' accessories, agricultural properties and
a majority interest in a company that develops and markets equipment used in
filmmaking. None of the above, singly, constitutes a material portion of
Registrant's operations.
 
                        ADDITIONAL BUSINESS INFORMATION
 
CUSTOMERS
 
     In 1994 sales to McLane Co. Inc., a national distributor, exceeded 10% of
Registrant's consolidated revenue.
 
ENVIRONMENTAL REGULATIONS
 
     Registrant does not believe that compliance with federal, state and local
provisions regulating the discharge of materials into the environment or
otherwise relating to the protection of the environment will have a material
effect upon the capital expenditures, earnings or competitive position of
Registrant.
 
NUMBER OF EMPLOYEES
 
     Registrant's average number of employees during 1994 was 3,817.
 
TRADEMARKS
 
     Registrant markets consumer products under a large number of trademarks.
All of the significant trademarks either have been registered or applications
therefor are pending with the United States Patent and Trademark Office.
 
SEASONAL BUSINESS
 
     No material portion of the business of any industry segment of Registrant
is seasonal.
 
ORDERS
 
     Backlog of orders is not a material factor in any industry segment of
Registrant.

ITEM 3 -- LEGAL PROCEEDINGS
 
     Registrant has been named in certain litigation against the major cigarette
companies and others seeking damages relating to the usage of cigarettes and, in
certain of the complaints, "tobacco products", one of which contains several
allegations relating to smokeless tobacco products, including:
 
     -- Norma R. Broin, et al. v. Philip Morris Companies, Inc. et al., Case
No.: 91-49738 CA (22), Circuit Court, 11th Judicial Circuit, Dade County,
Florida, served on or about January 17, 1992. Purported class action on behalf
of flight attendants seeking $5 billion in punitive damages and unspecified
compensatory damages as a result of exposure to environmental tobacco smoke on
airplanes; on December 12, 1994, the Circuit Court entered an order granting
certification of the class, which defendants have appealed.
 
     -- John G. Allman, et al. v. Philip Morris, Inc., et al., Case No.:
94-0504-IEG (CM), U.S. District Court, Southern District of California, served
on or about April 6, 1994. Purported class action on behalf of persons who have
smoked defendants' cigarettes, became "addicted" and purchased, or would be
purchasing in the future, nicotine patches, seeking unspecified damages for
various alleged violations including allegations of a conspiracy to withhold
information about the claimed effects of cigarette smoking; the court has
dismissed with prejudice the plaintiffs' complaint and the parties to this
action have entered into a stipulation dismissing with prejudice plaintiffs'
appeal of this decision.
 
     -- Diane Castano, et al. v. The American Tobacco Company, Inc., et al.,
Case No.: 94-1044 "B" (3), U.S. District Court, Eastern District of Louisiana,
served on or about May 12, 1994. Purported class action on behalf of "nicotine
dependent" persons who have smoked defendants' cigarettes, seeking unspecified
damages as a result of defendants' alleged manipulation of the levels of
nicotine in their cigarettes for the purpose of "addicting" consumers. On
February 17, 1995, the Court entered an order granting certification of the
class "only in regard to the liability issues of fraud, breach of warranty
(express or implied), intentional tort, negligence, strict liability and
consumer protection and punitive damages issues." The Court denied certification
of the class in regard to the issues of injury-in-fact, proximate cause,
reliance, affirmative defenses, compensatory damages and medical monitoring.
 
     -- McGraw v. The American Tobacco Company, et al., Civil Action No.
94-1707, Circuit Court of Kanawha County, West Virginia, served on or about
November 1, 1994. Action purportedly on behalf of the State of West Virginia
seeking unspecified damages and other relief as reimbursement for amounts
allegedly spent by the state as a result of "tobacco-related injuries, diseases
or sickness"; several allegations relate to smokeless tobacco products.
 
     Except for the Allman action which has been dismissed with prejudice, each
of these actions is in varying stages of pretrial activities.
 
     Registrant believes that these pending litigation matters will not result
in any material liability for a number of reasons, including the fact that
Registrant has had only limited involvement with cigarettes and Registrant's
current percentage of total tobacco industry sales is relatively small. Prior to
1986, Registrant manufactured some cigarette products which had a de minimis
market share. From May 1, 1982 to August 1, 1994, Registrant distributed a small
volume of imported cigarettes and is indemnified against claims relating to
those products.
 
     Registrant also believes that these actions are without merit and intends
to defend them vigorously.

                                    UST INC.
                      DIRECTORS' SUPPLEMENTAL MEDICAL PLAN
 
     1. Purpose; Applicability.  The purpose of the Plan is to provide
supplemental medical benefits to nonemployee members of the Board of Directors
of UST Inc. (the "Company"). The Plan was adopted as of January 1, 1994 and
amended and restated to add a new Section 3 as of February 16, 1995. The Plan
shall be applicable to all current or future directors of the Company, other
than directors who are employees or former employees of the Company or its
subsidiaries, whether direct or indirect ("Eligible Directors"). Neither the
spouse of an Eligible Director nor any other member of an Eligible Director's
family shall be eligible for coverage under the Plan.
 
     2. Benefits.  The Company, or any third party administrator appointed by
the Company, shall reimburse each Eligible Director for the reasonable,
medically related expenses incurred by such Director for deductibles,
coinsurance, co-pays, prescription drugs, physician charges, medically related
charges, annual physicals, professional nursing care, medically related
transportation and lodging, special health equipment, vision care, eyeglasses,
contact lenses and hearing aids ("Covered Expenses"); provided, however, that
(i) the amount of Covered Expenses incurred in any calendar year for which an
Eligible Director may be reimbursed shall not exceed $7,500, and (ii) Covered
Expenses shall not include cosmetic surgery, insurance premiums, hot tubs
(etc.), care not approved by a physician, act of war, free services, or claims
covered by any other health plan.
 
     3. Continuing Coverage.  Coverage under the Plan shall continue after an
Eligible Director's service as a director ceases for any reason, for the same
number of months as the number of full months that the Eligible Director shall
have served as a director; provided, however, that in the event an Eligible
Director dies before the end of the period in which payments are to be made,
coverage shall cease as of the last day of the month in which occurs the death
of such Director.
 
     4. Administration.  The Company, or any third party administrator appointed
by the Company, may establish such reasonable rules and conditions for the
submission and reimbursement of claims as it shall in its discretion determine.
 
     5. No Right of Service.  Nothing contained in this Plan shall give any
Director the right to remain as a director.
 
     6. Nontransferability.  No amounts payable under the Plan shall be
transferable by the Eligible Director.
 
     7. Amendments to Plan.  The Board of Directors of the Company may, by its
duly taken action, at any time terminate or from time to time modify or suspend
the Plan, in whole or in part, except that termination, modification or
suspension of the Plan shall not, without the consent of the affected Eligible
Directors, adversely affect any right of any such Director to receive benefits
that have previously accrued.
 
     8. Governing Law.  The Plan shall be governed and construed in accordance
with the laws of the State of Delaware.

CASH DIVIDENDS
 
     The Company increased its 1994 cash dividend by 16.7 percent to an annual
rate of $1.12 per share. Since 1991, the dividend rate has increased 69.7
percent reflecting an average annual increase of 19.3 percent. Total cash
dividends paid by the Company in 1994 were $225.7 million or 58.2 percent of net
earnings. Cash dividends paid to stockholders have exceeded 50 percent of net
earnings in each of the last three years.
 
     In December 1994, the Board of Directors approved a first quarter 1995
dividend of 32 1/2 cents per share. This equates to an indicated annual rate of
$1.30, and represents an increase of 16.1 percent. The Company has paid cash
dividends without interruption since 1912. Future dividends depend on many
factors, including internal estimates of future performance and the Company's
need for funds.

                      MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS
 
RESULTS OF OPERATIONS
 
CONSOLIDATED RESULTS
 
  1994 compared with 1993
 
     Consolidated net sales rose to $1.22 billion, a 10.1 percent increase over
1993.
 
     Tobacco segment sales increased 11.2 percent, and accounted for 94.7
percent of the $112.6 million sales increase. The Wine segment also contributed
to the overall sales gain, posting an 11.2 percent increase. Other segment sales
were lower due to the absence of Zig-Zag cigarette papers and related products
resulting from the sale of its distribution rights on March 31, 1993, partially
offset by increased sales in the entertainment business.
 
     Over the last three years, net sales have increased 35.2 percent at an
average annual rate of 10.6 percent.
 
     Cost of products sold increased 2.2 percent to $251.9 million. Cost of
products sold for the Tobacco segment was slightly higher, as higher unit costs
and increased unit volume for moist smokeless tobacco were offset by lower costs
for other tobacco products resulting from significant volume declines. Wine
segment costs were higher due to volume gains which were partially offset by
lower unit costs. Costs for the Other segment were lower primarily due to the
absence of cigarette papers and lower Canadian excise taxes, partially offset by
increased costs due to volume gains for the entertainment business.
 
     Gross profit increased $107.1 million, or 12.4 percent over 1993 primarily
due to higher selling prices and increased unit volume for moist smokeless
tobacco.
 
     The gross profit percentage rose to 79.4 percent mainly due to the
favorable results for moist smokeless tobacco and volume declines for lower
margin products. The gross profit percentage has increased 4.6 percentage points
over the last three years.
 
     Selling, advertising and administrative expenses rose 10.4 percent to
$330.3 million. Selling and advertising expenses increased for the Tobacco and
Other segments and remained stable in the Wine segment. Administrative and other
expenses were generally higher due to increases in salary and related costs,
increased spending associated with addressing legal and regulatory issues, the
early adoption of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 116,
"Accounting for Contributions Received and Contributions Made" and reserves
recorded for nonstrategic assets.
 
     The Company incurred net interest expense as a result of interest expense
on short-term borrowings and long-term debt exceeding income from cash
equivalent investments.
 
     The comparison of earnings per share for the year 1994 as compared to 1993,
was adversely affected by 3 cents due to several events which occurred in 1993.
On March 31, 1993, the Company sold its distribution rights for Zig-Zag
cigarette papers and related products which resulted in an after-tax gain of $22
million or 10 cents per share. In addition, operating results for the year of
1994 do not include Zig-Zag and related products amounting to 2 cents per share.
Also in 1993, the Company adopted SFAS No. 106 and SFAS No. 109, which reduced
primary earnings per share by 9 cents.
 
     Pretax profit margins decreased slightly to 52.4 percent on earnings before
income taxes of $640.6 million. Over the last three years, earnings before
income taxes have increased 50.4 percent at an average annual rate of 14.7
percent, while pretax margins have averaged 51.7 percent.
 
     The overall tax rate for 1994 increased slightly.
 
     Net earnings increased for the 34th consecutive year rising 11 percent to
$387.5 million. Primary earnings per share rose to $1.87, a 15.4 percent
increase over 1993. Primary earnings per share have increased 58.5 percent over
the last three years at an average annual rate of 16.6 percent.
 
  1993 compared with 1992
 
     Consolidated net sales rose 6.8 percent to $1.11 billion.
<PAGE>   2
 
     The Tobacco segment accounted for 95.2 percent of the $71 million sales
increase. The Wine segment also contributed to the overall sales gain, posting a
13.8 percent increase. Other segment sales were lower due to the absence of
Zig-Zag cigarette papers and related products resulting from the sale of its
distribution rights on March 31, 1993.
 
     Cost of products sold decreased 4 percent to $246.4 million. Cost of
products sold for the Tobacco segment was lower due to significant volume
declines for other tobacco products which was partially offset by higher unit
costs and increased unit volume for moist smokeless tobacco. Costs for the Other
segment were lower primarily due to the absence of cigarette papers, while Wine
segment unit costs were higher.
 
     Gross profit increased $81.4 million, or 10.4 percent over 1992, primarily
due to higher selling prices and increased unit volume for moist smokeless
tobacco.
 
     The gross profit percentage rose to 77.8 percent, mainly due to favorable
results for moist smokeless tobacco and volume declines for lower margin
products.
 
     Selling, advertising and administrative expenses rose 6.2 percent to $299.2
million. Selling and advertising expenses increased for all segments.
Administrative and other expenses were generally lower, with increases in salary
and related costs being offset by lower spending in other areas and gains
recorded on the sale of corporate investments.
 
     Operating income increased 12.8 percent in 1993 to $564.8 million.
 
     Net interest income resulted as income from cash equivalent investments
exceeded interest expense.
 
     Results for 1993, as compared to 1992, were affected by several events. The
Company sold its distribution rights for Zig-Zag cigarette papers and related
products on March 31, 1993 for $39 million in cash and additional consideration
based on future earnings for the next ten years. This transaction resulted in an
after-tax gain of $22 million, amounting to 10 cents per share. The absence of
these products in operating results for the remainder of 1993 reduced primary
earnings per share by 2 cents. In addition, the "Omnibus Budget Reconciliation
Act," which increased the statutory corporate federal income tax rate to 35
percent retroactive to January 1, 1993, reduced primary earnings per share by 3
cents for the year. Also in 1993, the Company adopted SFAS No. 106, "Employers'
Accounting for Postretirement Benefits Other Than Pensions," and SFAS No. 109,
"Accounting for Income Taxes." As a result of adopting SFAS No. 106 the Company
recorded a one-time charge to net earnings of $32.7 million. The adoption of
SFAS No. 109 resulted in an increase in net earnings of $12.8 million. The
cumulative effect of these accounting changes reduced primary earnings per share
by 9 cents.
 
     Profit margins rose to 54.2 percent on earnings before income taxes and the
cumulative effect of accounting changes of $601.8 million.
 
     The overall tax rate for 1993 increased due to the higher statutory
corporate federal income tax rate.
 
     Net earnings increased 11.7 percent to $349 million. Primary earnings per
share before the cumulative effect of accounting changes rose to $1.71, a 21.3
percent increase over 1992. Primary earnings per share, after the cumulative
effect of accounting changes, rose to $1.62, a 14.9 percent increase over 1992.
 
TOBACCO SEGMENT
 
  1994 compared with 1993
 
     Tobacco segment sales increased 11.2 percent to $1.06 billion and accounted
for 86.5 percent of consolidated revenues. Smokeless tobacco sales increased
12.4 percent to $1.05 billion, representing 85.5 percent of consolidated sales.
Other tobacco product sales decreased significantly due to volume declines.
 
     The increase in smokeless tobacco sales resulted from higher selling prices
and unit volume gains for moist smokeless tobacco. Domestic unit volume for
moist smokeless tobacco products increased 2.6 percent in 1994 to 627.4 million
cans, as compared with the similar period for 1993. Fourth quarter unit volume
increased 4.1 percent to 158.2 million cans, compared with the similar 1993
period. The unit volume
<PAGE>   3
 
comparison for the fourth quarter of 1994 to the similar period in the prior
year was favorably affected by distributor inventory build-up in December.
 
     Cost of sales for the Tobacco segment was slightly higher, as higher unit
costs and increased unit volume for moist smokeless tobacco were offset by lower
costs due to significant volume declines for other tobacco products. Moist
smokeless tobacco unit costs increased slightly due to higher leaf tobacco costs
and overhead expenses.
 
     Gross profit for the segment rose substantially during 1994. Higher selling
prices and unit volume gains for moist smokeless tobacco were the primary
reasons for the increase.
 
     Selling expenses increased 7.5 percent, primarily due to higher costs
associated with promotional activities as well as higher salaries for the sales
force and support personnel.
 
     Advertising costs increased slightly as compared with the prior year.
Selling and advertising expenses were directed at the promotion and support of
our moist smokeless tobacco products. Administrative expenses were significantly
higher primarily due to expenses incurred to address legal and regulatory issues
and increased salary and related costs.
 
     Operating profit increased 14.3 percent to $653.7 million.
 
  1993 compared with 1992
 
     Tobacco segment sales rose to $951.6 million for an increase of 7.6 percent
and accounted for 85.7 percent of consolidated revenues. Smokeless tobacco sales
increased 11.7 percent to $930.5 million, and represented 83.8 percent of
consolidated sales. Other tobacco product sales decreased significantly due to
lower unit volume.
 
     The increase in smokeless tobacco sales resulted from higher selling prices
and unit volume gains for moist smokeless tobacco. Domestic unit volume for
moist smokeless tobacco products increased 2.3 percent in 1993, to 611.6 million
cans, which included one less shipping day as compared to 1992. On an equivalent
shipping day basis unit volume for domestic moist smokeless tobacco would have
increased 3.1 percent.
 
     Moist smokeless tobacco unit costs increased slightly due to higher leaf
tobacco costs and increased excise taxes imposed January 1, 1993. Cost of sales
for the Tobacco segment was significantly lower due to decreased unit volume for
other tobacco products which have higher unit costs as compared to moist
smokeless tobacco.
 
     Gross profit for the segment rose substantially during 1993 as a result of
higher selling prices and unit volume gains for moist smokeless tobacco.
 
     Selling expenses increased 12.9 percent, primarily due to higher costs
associated with promotional activities and higher salaries and increased
expenses for the sales force.
 
     Advertising costs increased significantly as compared with the prior year.
Selling and advertising expenses were directed at the promotion and support of
our moist smokeless tobacco products, including two new flavors which were
introduced during 1993. Administrative expenses were lower as increased salary
and related costs were offset by lower spending in other areas.
 
     Operating profit increased 12.4 percent to $572.1 million.
 
WINE SEGMENT
 
  1994 compared with 1993
 
     Wine segment revenue increased 11.2 percent to $89.2 million and accounted
for 7.3 percent of consolidated sales. Higher case volume for premium wine
accounted for the increase. Case volume for premium wine increased 13.2 percent.
Overall case volume for the Wine segment increased 9.2 percent. Chateau Ste.
Michelle and Columbia Crest, our two leading brands of premium wine, accounted
for approximately 70 percent of total wine revenue.
<PAGE>   4
 
     Unit costs decreased slightly primarily due to excellent harvest yields in
1992 and 1993.
 
     The Company uses grapes both harvested from its own vineyards and purchased
from regional growers in its wine production. Total grape tonnage harvested and
purchased in 1994 was significantly lower than the exceptional harvest
experienced in 1993. As a result of lower harvest yields, the cost for grapes
was slightly higher which will affect future unit costs. However, the 1994
harvest level was adequate to enable the Company to meet its requirements for
premium wine.
 
     Gross profit for the Wine segment increased 13.1 percent primarily as a
result of an increase in premium wine case volume and slightly lower unit costs.
 
     Selling, advertising and administrative expenses remained stable in 1994.
Selling and advertising expenses were directed toward expanding the brand
awareness of premium wines, primarily Columbia Crest and Domaine Ste. Michelle.
 
     Administrative and other expenses, primarily salary and related expenses,
were slightly higher.
 
     The Wine segment recorded an operating profit of $8.8 million in 1994, an
increase of 44.2 percent over 1993.
 
  1993 compared with 1992
 
     Wine segment revenue increased 13.8 percent to $80.2 million and accounted
for 7.2 percent of consolidated sales. Higher case volume for premium wine
accounted for the increase. Overall case volume for the Wine segment increased
7.6 percent, while case volume for premium wine increased 14.4 percent.
 
     Overall, unit costs increased primarily due to higher grape costs resulting
from low harvest yields in prior years.
 
     Total grape tonnage harvested and purchased in 1993 was significantly
higher than in 1992, resulting in increased inventory levels, which will have a
favorable effect on future unit costs.
 
     Gross profit for the Wine segment increased 10.7 percent primarily as a
result of an increase in premium wine case volume partially offset by higher
unit costs.
 
     Selling, advertising and administrative expenses increased in 1993. Selling
expenses increased primarily to support higher volume levels of premium brands.
 
     Advertising expenses were higher and were aimed at supporting and expanding
national brand awareness of our existing premium wines and new products.
 
     Administrative and other expenses were slightly lower as higher salary and
related costs were offset by lower spending in other areas.
 
     The Wine segment recorded an operating profit of $6.1 million in 1993.
 
OTHER SEGMENT
 
  1994 compared with 1993
 
     Other segment sales were $78.7 million, a 3.4 percent decrease from 1993,
and accounted for 6.4 percent of consolidated sales. Other segment sales were
lower due to the sale of the distribution rights for Zig-Zag cigarette papers
and related products on March 31, 1993, partially offset by higher revenues for
the entertainment business.
 
     The absence of the cigarette paper operations for the entire year, higher
spending associated with developing international markets and reserves recorded
for nonstrategic assets more than offset favorable results for the entertainment
business. Overall, the Other segment recorded an operating profit of $1.5
million in 1994.
<PAGE>   5
 
  1993 compared with 1992
 
     Other segment sales decreased 7 percent to $81.5 million and accounted for
7.3 percent of consolidated sales. Other segment sales were lower due to the
sale of the distribution rights for Zig-Zag cigarette papers and related
products on March 31, 1993. The absence of these products for the remainder of
1993 had an adverse effect on the operating results for the Other segment.
 
     Operating profit was significantly lower for tobacco-related products due
to the sale of the cigarette paper business, but was partially offset by
favorable results for other businesses. The Other segment recorded an operating
profit of $9.2 million in 1993.
 
HEALTH CARE REFORM
 
     As introduced by the Clinton Administration during the 103rd Congress, The
Health Security Act proposed, among other things, a significant federal excise
tax increase on all tobacco products, including moist snuff. This proposal
failed last year. We expect some form of health care debate during the 104th
Congress and we will vigorously oppose any proposed increase in the federal
excise tax on our tobacco products. Accordingly, the Company is not able to
predict the amount, if any, by which the federal excise tax rate may increase,
or assess the future effect that any such increase may have on its tobacco
business.
 
FINANCIAL CONDITION
 
SOURCES AND USES OF CASH -- OPERATIONS
 
     Cash provided by operating activities is the major source of funds
available to the Company. Cash from operations increased to $453.2 million in
1994, as compared to $367.6 million in 1993 and $288.8 million in 1992. The
primary reason for the increase was higher earnings generated by the Tobacco
segment.
 
     Significant inventories of leaf tobacco are required primarily in
connection with our smokeless tobacco products. During the last three years,
$175.4 million was used for the purchase of leaf tobacco and related costs. In
addition, the cost of grapes harvested and purchased totaled $64.7 million over
the last three years.
 
INVESTING ACTIVITIES
 
     Net cash used in investing activities was $21.5 million in 1994. Purchases
of property, plant and equipment over the last three years totaled $119.9
million.
 
     Major areas of capital spending from 1992 through 1994 were:
 
Tobacco segment
 
- - Manufacturing, processing and packaging equipment
 
- - Automobiles for the sales force
 
- - Building renovations
 
Wine segment
 
- - Storage capacity and processing equipment
 
- - New facilities and building renovations
 
- - Irrigation and vineyard development
 
Other segment
 
- - Equipment
 
- - Building additions and renovations
<PAGE>   6
 
Shared assets
 
- - Transportation equipment -- primarily aircraft
 
- - Headquarters, conference and training facility renovations
 
     In 1995, the Company's capital program is expected to approximate $52
million, and will primarily include improvements to the tobacco processing and
manufacturing operations and the expansion of wine processing and storage
facilities.
 
     In 1993 the Company sold its distribution rights for Zig-Zag cigarette
papers and related products for $39 million in cash and additional consideration
based on future earnings.
 
FINANCING ACTIVITIES
 
     Other significant sources and uses of cash over the last three years have
included long-term borrowings, the issuance of common stock, stock repurchases
and cash dividends. During 1994, the Company entered into a $200 million
revolving credit and term loan agreement with several banks replacing the
similar $50 million credit facility. The Company has borrowed $125 million under
this credit facility since 1993 and used the funds for its share repurchase
program. The remaining $75 million is available and may be used for the stock
repurchase program depending on market conditions. (See Revolving Credit and
Term Loan Agreement and Short-Term Lines of Credit Note.)
 
     Common stock was issued upon the exercise of options granted under the
Company's stock option plans. Options are granted to employees who have made or
who are expected to make contributions to the growth of the Company. The Company
receives income tax benefits upon the exercise of certain of these options.
Since 1991, funds received from the exercise of options, together with these tax
benefits, totaled $168.7 million.
 
     During 1994, the Company continued its program to repurchase shares of its
common stock as authorized by the Board of Directors. In 1994, the Board of
Directors approved a new stock repurchase program, authorizing the Company to
repurchase up to 20 million shares of its common stock from time to time in open
market or negotiated transactions to be used in connection with employee benefit
programs and other corporate purposes. The new program commenced during the
fourth quarter of 1994, upon completion of the prior program, which provided for
the repurchase of up to 40 million shares.
 
     During 1994, the Company repurchased 10.6 million shares at a cost of
$298.8 million. As of December 31, 1994, 15.8 million shares remained to be
repurchased under the new program.
 
     It is the Company's philosophy that its stockholders should benefit
directly from increases in net earnings. Accordingly, the Company has regularly
increased dividend payments as earnings have risen. During the last three years,
cash dividends distributed to stockholders amounted to $593.4 million, totaling
56.6 percent of net earnings for the period.
 
LIQUIDITY
 
     Sources of cash exceeded uses of cash by $25.4 million in 1994. The Company
anticipates that cash generated from operating activities will meet most of its
requirements in 1995. Seasonal purchases of leaf tobacco occasionally require
the Company to use short-term borrowings in the form of commercial paper, when
necessary, to augment cash generated by operating activities. In 1994 sufficient
cash was generated to meet these requirements and short-term borrowings were
limited. The Company anticipates that leaf tobacco purchases and related costs
in 1995 will increase to approximately $82 million as compared to $70 million
for 1994. Increased spending in 1995 reflects the Company's plan to maintain a
higher level of leaf tobacco inventory.
 
     The ratio of current assets to current liabilities (current ratio) at
December 31, 1994 was 2.4 to 1 and has averaged 3.2 to 1 over the last three
years. Increases in accrued expenses and income taxes payable reduced the
current ratio from prior years. However, the Company continues to maintain a
strong liquidity position. Further enhancing this position is the fact that
certain inventories are carried at costs computed under the
<PAGE>   7
 
LIFO method. The average costs of these inventories was $41.8 million more than
the amount at which they are carried in the Consolidated Statement of Financial
Position at December 31, 1994.
 
     The Company believes that adequate credit facilities are available through
committed short-term credit lines. The Company has available short-term lines of
credit with domestic and foreign banks totaling $100 million at December 31,
1994. The lines of credit are generally committed for a one-year period expiring
at various times during 1995 and provide for borrowing at prime rates. These
arrangements require commitment fees which are not significant. These facilities
can be used as bank financing or as support for commercial paper borrowing. The
commercial paper market is expected to continue as an attractive source of
funds. The Company has the highest ratings available on its commercial paper.
 
     The Company intends to maintain appropriate facilities to ensure access to
credit markets providing sufficient financial resources and operational
flexibility.
 
CAPITAL RESOURCES
 
     Over the last two years the Company has taken advantage of its strong
capital structure and relatively low interest rates in the marketplace and has
borrowed $125 million under its $200 million credit facility. This amount was
classified as long-term debt at December 31, 1994. These borrowings were used
for the stock repurchase program. Depending on market conditions the Company may
borrow the additional $75 million available under this credit facility in 1995
and use the proceeds for the stock repurchase program. (See Revolving Credit and
Term Loan Agreement and Short-Term Lines of Credit Note.)
 
     The percentage of long-term debt outstanding to stockholders' equity is
34.6 percent. The Company had no short-term debt outstanding at December 31,
1994.
 
     Stockholders' equity decreased in 1994, as the effects of the stock
repurchase program and dividend payments exceeded the effects of net earnings
and common stock issued under the Company's stock option plans.
 
     The return on average stockholders' equity has increased by 38.4 percentage
points to 94 percent over the last three years.

DIVIDENDS AND STOCK PRICES
 
CASH DIVIDENDS
 
     The Company increased its 1994 cash dividend by 16.7 percent to an annual
rate of $1.12 per share. Since 1991, the dividend rate has increased 69.7
percent reflecting an average annual increase of 19.3 percent. Total cash
dividends paid by the Company in 1994 were $225.7 million or 58.2 percent of net
earnings. Cash dividends paid to stockholders have exceeded 50 percent of net
earnings in each of the last three years.
 
     In December 1994, the Board of Directors approved a first quarter 1995
dividend of 32 1/2 cents per share. This equates to an indicated annual rate of
$1.30, and represents an increase of 16.1 percent. The Company has paid cash
dividends without interruption since 1912. Future dividends depend on many
factors, including internal estimates of future performance and the Company's
need for funds.
 
STOCK PRICES
 
     UST shares are traded on the New York Stock Exchange and the Pacific Stock
Exchange, ticker
symbol -- UST.
 
     The number of stockholders of record at December 31, 1994 was 13,116. The
following table sets foth dividends paid per share and the high and low market
prices for the year and each quarter of 1994 and 1993.

                   NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
 
SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES
 
  Consolidation
 
     The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company
and all of its subsidiaries after the elimination of intercompany accounts and
transactions. Investments in a limited partnership and 50 percent or less owned
companies, accounted for by the equity method, are carried at amounts equal to
the Company's equity in the underlying assets of such entities.
 
  Fair Value of Financial Instruments
 
     The estimated fair value of amounts reported in the consolidated financial
statements have been determined by using available market information and
appropriate valuation methodologies. All current assets and current liabilities
are carried at their fair value, which approximates market value, because of
their short-term nature. The fair value of long-term investments and long-term
debt approximate their carrying value.
 
  Inventories
 
     Inventories are stated at lower of cost or market. The major portion of
leaf tobacco and briar inventory costs is determined by the last-in, first-out
(LIFO) method. The cost of the remaining inventories is determined by the
first-in, first-out (FIFO) and average cost methods. Leaf tobacco and wine
inventories are included in current assets as a standard industry practice,
notwithstanding the fact that such inventories are carried for several years for
the purpose of curing and aging.
 
  Property, Plant and Equipment
 
     Property, plant and equipment are carried at cost less allowances for
depreciation computed by the straight line method.
 
  Goodwill
 
     Goodwill represents the excess of cost over the fair value of net assets of
businesses acquired. Unamortized goodwill is included in other assets and is
being amortized ratably over periods from ten to forty years ending in 2026.
 
  Income Taxes
 
     Income taxes are provided on all revenue and expense items included in the
Consolidated Statement of Earnings, regardless of the period in which such items
are recognized for income tax purposes, except for items representing permanent
differences between pretax accounting income and taxable income. Deferred income
taxes are provided on temporary differences between the carrying amounts of
assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the amounts used for
income tax purposes.
 
  Earnings Per Share
 
     Primary earnings per share are calculated by dividing net earnings by the
weighted average number of common and common equivalent shares outstanding
during the period. Common equivalent shares are shares which would be issuable
upon the exercise of outstanding stock options, reduced by the number of shares
which are assumed to be purchased by the Company from the resulting proceeds at
the average market price during the period. For the fully diluted earnings per
share calculation, shares are assumed to be purchased by the Company at the
higher of the average or period-end price and may include additional dilutive
options.

REVOLVING CREDIT AND TERM LOAN AGREEMENT AND SHORT-TERM LINES OF CREDIT
 
     In 1994, the Company entered into a $200 million revolving credit and term
loan agreement with several banks. This agreement replaced the $50 million
revolving credit and term loan agreement which had been in effect since 1993.
 
     At December 31, 1994 the Company had $125 million outstanding under this
agreement at interest rates ranging from 5.9 percent to 6.5 percent. At December
31, 1994 this amount was classified as long-term debt in the Consolidated
Statement of Financial Position.
 
     Under the terms of the agreement, the Company may borrow funds and elect to
pay interest under the "Base Rate," "Competitive Bid" or "Eurodollar" interest
rate provisions. The terms of the agreement provide for a three-year revolving
line of credit. At the Company's option, any balance outstanding thereafter may
be converted into a three-year term loan. Principal repayments are optional
during the revolving credit period, while 36 equal monthly installments are
required during the term loan period. The Company is required to pay a facility
fee of 1/10 of 1 percent per annum during the revolving credit period.
 
     Certain provisions of this agreement require the maintenance of tangible
net worth levels as well as certain financial ratios. The agreement expires in
August of 2000.
 
     In addition, the Company has available short-term lines of credit with
domestic and foreign banks totaling $100 million at December 31, 1994 and 1993.
The lines of credit are generally committed for a one-year period expiring at
various times during 1995, and provide for borrowing at prime rates. These
arrangements require commitment fees which are not significant.
 
OTHER LIABILITIES
 
     Other liabilities include the non-current portion of the net pension
liabilities for 1994 and 1993 of $27.1 million and $30.9 million, respectively.
(See Employee Benefit and Compensation Plans Note.)
 
CAPITAL STOCK
 
     The Company has two classes of capital stock, preferred stock and common
stock. Preferred stock carries a par value of $.10 and no shares have been
issued. Common stock carries a $.50 par value. Authorized preferred stock is 10
million shares and authorized common stock is 600 million shares.
 
     In 1994, the Board of Directors approved a new stock repurchase program,
authorizing the Company to repurchase up to 20 million shares of its common
stock from time to time in open market or in negotiated transactions for use in
connection with employee benefit programs and other corporate purposes. The new
program began upon the completion of the prior program which provided for the
repurchase of up to 40 million shares of the Company's common stock and had been
in effect since 1990. In 1994, the Company repurchased a total of 10.6 million
shares of its common stock pursuant to its stock repurchase programs of which
4.2 million shares related to the new program.

STOCK OPTIONS
 
     The Company maintains two stock option plans, the 1992 and 1982 Stock
Option Plans. At December 31, 1994, 7,502,700 shares were available for grant
under the 1992 plan, while no shares were available under the 1982 plan. Under
the plans, options may be granted at not less than the fair market value on the
date of grant.
 
     Under the 1992 Stock Option Plan, options first become exercisable, in
ratable installments or otherwise, over a period of one to five years from the
date of grant and may be exercised up to a maximum of ten years from the date of
grant using various payment methods.

EMPLOYEE BENEFIT AND COMPENSATION PLANS
 
     The Company and its subsidiaries maintain a number of noncontributory
defined benefit pension plans covering substantially all employees over age 21
with at least one year of service. The Company's plan for salaried employees
provides pension benefits based on their highest three-year average
compensation. The Company's funding policy for this plan is to contribute an
amount sufficient to meet or exceed ERISA minimum requirements. All other funded
plans base benefits on the employee's compensation in each year of employment.
The Company's funding policy for these plans is generally to contribute the
annual normal cost plus the amount required to amortize unfunded liabilities
over 20 years from the date established. The Company also maintains unfunded
plans providing pension and additional benefits for certain employees. The
assumptions used to determine expense for 1994, 1993 and 1992 were:

     For 1994 and 1993, the net pension assets of $22.1 million and $23.5
million, respectively, consist of prepaid pension costs and are included in
other assets. The noncurrent portion of the net liabilities for 1994 and 1993 of
$30.3 million and $33.8 million, respectively, are included in other
liabilities.
 
     For pension plans whose accumulated benefits exceed assets at December 31,
1994, the Consolidated Statement of Financial Position reflects an additional
minimum liability of $6.1 million: an intangible asset of $3.1 million included
in other assets and a reduction of retained earnings of $2 million, which is net
of deferred tax benefits of $1 million. At December 31, 1993, the Consolidated
Statement of Financial Position included an additional minimum liability of
$11.5 million: an intangible asset of $4.3 million and a reduction of retained
earnings of $4.8 million, which is net of deferred tax benefits of $2.4 million.
 
     Plan assets include marketable equity securities (including common stock of
the Company having a market value of $35.7 million as of December 31, 1994 and
$35.5 million as of December 31, 1993) and corporate and government debt
securities.
 
     The discount rate used in determining the present value of benefit
obligations was 9 percent for 1994 and 7 percent for 1993.
 
     The Company sponsors a defined contribution plan (Employees' Savings Plan)
covering substantially all of its employees. The Plan requires one year of
service prior to eligibility for participation. Company contributions are based
upon participant contributions. The expense was $3.7 million in 1994, $3.6
million in 1993 and $3.4 million in 1992.
 
     The Company has an Incentive Compensation Plan which provides for incentive
payments to designated employees based on stated percentages of net income as
defined in the Plan. Expenses under the Plan amounted to $33.5 million for 1994,
$28.8 million for 1993 and $26.3 million for 1992.

POSTRETIREMENT BENEFITS OTHER THAN PENSIONS
 
     The Company and certain of its subsidiaries maintain a number of
postretirement welfare benefit plans which provide certain medical and life
insurance benefits to substantially all full-time employees who have attained
certain age and service requirements upon retirement. The health care benefits
are subject to deductibles, co-insurance and in some cases flat dollar
contributions which vary by plan, age and service at retirement. All life
insurance coverage is noncontributory. The welfare plans are not funded.
 
     Effective January 1, 1993, the Company adopted SFAS No. 106, "Employers'
Accounting for Postretirement Benefits Other Than Pensions," which requires the
Company to accrue the expected cost of providing postretirement benefits as an
employee renders service.
 
     In 1993 the Company elected to immediately recognize the accumulated
postretirement benefit obligation of $50.8 million through a one-time cumulative

</TABLE>
 
     The discount rate used in determining the net periodic postretirement
benefit cost was 7 percent for 1994 and 8 percent for 1993.
 
     The rate of increase in per capita costs of covered health care benefits is
assumed to be 11.1 percent for 1995 and to decrease gradually to 6.5 percent by
the year 2008 and remain at that level thereafter. The health care cost trend
rate assumption has a significant effect on the amounts reported. To illustrate,
increasing the assumed health care cost trend rates by 1 percentage point in
each year would increase the accumulated postretirement benefit obligation as of
December 31, 1994 by approximately $7 million and the 1994 net periodic
postretirement benefit cost by approximately $1.2 million.
 
     The weighted average discount rate used in determining the accumulated
postretirement benefit obligation was 9 percent at December 31, 1994 and 7
percent at December 31, 1993.

INCOME TAXES
 
     Effective January 1, 1993, the Company adopted SFAS No. 109, "Accounting
for Income Taxes," which required a change in the method of accounting for
income taxes from the deferred method to the liability method. The Company
reflected this change through a cumulative effect adjustment which increased net
earnings and reduced deferred tax liabilities reported in the Consolidated
Statement of Financial Position by $12.8 million.
 
     Deferred income taxes reflect the net tax effects of temporary differences
between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial reporting
purposes and the amounts used for income tax purposes.
 
     Significant components of the Company's deferred tax liabilities and assets
as of December 31 are as follows:

     The first quarter of 1993 includes a pretax gain of $35 million, amounting
to 10 cents per share, from the sale of a tobacco-related business. This gain
was offset by the cumulative effect of accounting changes as a result of the
adoption of SFAS No. 106 and SFAS No. 109, which resulted in a decrease in net
earnings of $19.8 million, or 9 cents per share.

INDUSTRY SEGMENT DATA
 
     The Company's industry segments are Tobacco, Wine and Other. The Company
operates primarily in the tobacco industry and also produces and markets a
number of nontobacco products. Tobacco segment sales are principally to a large
number of wholesalers and chain stores which are widely dispersed. In 1994,
sales to one wholesale customer accounted for approximately 19 percent of
Tobacco segment sales.
 
     The Company operates primarily in the United States; foreign operations and
export sales are not significant. Intersegment sales are accounted for at cost.
 
     Operating profit is total revenue less operating expenses excluding
corporate expenses and interest, net, and in 1993, the gain on disposal of a
product line. Identifiable assets by segment include assets directly identified
with those operations and an allocable share of jointly used assets. Corporate
assets consist primarily of cash and cash equivalents, other long-term
investments and an allocation of property, plant and equipment associated with
nonsegment activities.
 
OTHER MATTERS
 
     The Company has been named in certain litigation against the major
cigarette companies and others seeking damages relating to the usage of
cigarettes and, in certain of the complaints, "tobacco products," one of which
contains several allegations relating to smokeless tobacco products.
 
     The Company believes that these pending litigation matters will not result
in any material liability for a number of reasons, including the fact that the
Company has had only limited involvement with cigarettes and the Company's
current percentage of total tobacco industry sales is relatively small. Prior to
1986, the Company manufactured some cigarette products which had a de minimis
market share. From May 1, 1982 to August 1, 1994, the Company distributed a
small volume of imported cigarettes and is indemnified against claims relating
to those products.
 
     The Company also believes that these actions are without merit and intends
to defend them vigorously.
 
     On March 31, 1993, the Company sold its distribution rights for Zig-Zag
cigarette papers and related products for $39 million in cash and additional
consideration for the next ten years. The transaction resulted in a pretax gain
of $35 million, amounting to 10 cents per share.

position of UST Inc. as of December 31, 1994 and 1993, and the related
consolidated statements of earnings, changes in stockholders' equity, and cash
flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 1994. These
financial statements are the responsibility of the Company's management. Our
responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements based on
our audits.
 
     We conducted our audits in accordance with generally accepted auditing
standards. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material
misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting
the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. An audit also includes
assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by
management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation.
We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.
 
     In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present fairly,
in all material respects, the consolidated financial position of UST Inc. at
December 31, 1994 and 1993, and the consolidated results of its operations and
its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 1994
in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles.
 
     As discussed in the notes to the financial statements, in 1993 the Company
changed its methods of accounting for Income Taxes and Postretirement Benefits
Other Than Pensions.
