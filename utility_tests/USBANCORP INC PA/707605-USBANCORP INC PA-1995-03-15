MESSAGE TO THE SHAREHOLDER

Dear Shareholder:

FINANCIAL REVIEW
The year 1994 was a mixed period of strategic triumphs and
financial tribulations. Our pre-tax income, exclusive of the
one-time acquisition charge related to the intra-market purchase
of Johnstown Savings Bank, reached a five year high of $19.7
million, 120% better than 1990; our year-end stock price at
$21.00 per share was 11.5% lower than year-end 1993, but 65%
higher than year-end 1990. Our net interest income recorded a
tenth consecutive year of increase, reaching $55.8 million or 76%
greater than for 1990; our net interest margin percentage
declined by 31 basis points to a recent annual historic low of
4.03%. Our total assets jumped during 1994 by 44% to $1.79
billion at year-end, a corporate record; our net loans and loans
held for sale rose just 19.7% to $868 million at December 31. The
underlying reasons for each of these financial observations are
carefully and comprehensively explained in the "Financial
Condition and Results of Operations" management discussion and
analysis beginning on page 47 of this report. You are encouraged
to read this material to better understand your Company's
performance and the soundness of your investment. And as we all
enter 1995, we now are able to review the year just ended with
the unfettered vision provided by hindsight.
We are not in the business of predicting interest rates, although
much of our net revenues are dependent upon them. Instead, we
manage our banking business to prudently seize occasional market
opportunities when they become available as in our investment
leverage program and to insulate ourselves from excessive rate
volatility through our hedging and well-developed interest rate
risk management discipline. At the writing of our 1993 message to
you, we would not have correctly forecasted six Federal Reserve
rate increases aggregating 250 basis points for 1994; the speed,
frequency, and total of the rate moves would have exceeded our
year-end 1993 expectation, had we boldly and unnecessarily
ventured such a prediction. During mid-year 1994, we began,
however, to reposition your Company for the rising rate
environment in which we find ourselves. We strategically
repositioned our $784 million investment portfolio substantially;
at December 31, 1994, our portfolio has a weighted average
maturity of just 3.8 years (up slightly from 2.8 years at
year-end 1993), a weighted average coupon of 6.84% (up sharply
from 5.45% at December 31, 1993), and a 25% variable rate
composition (up from only 15% at year-end 1993). And today we
have in place $100 million of off-balance sheet hedges through
which we are partially protected from further rate hikes through
September 28, 1995. In review, we would have done more,
longer-term hedging - had we just known the vigor of the Federal
Reserve's anti-inflation quest.
We are in the business of managing an efficient banking delivery
system. At December 31, 1994, we reached assets per employee of
$2.3 million, a five year productivity performance high bettering
1990 by 58%. We lowered our net overhead expense (excluding the
acquisition charge) to average assets to 2.32% from 2.89% in
1990, a third consecutive improving year. In 1993 we told you
that we expected $3.8 million annually in pre-tax savings upon
full integration of the intra-market Johnstown Savings Bank
acquisition. We realized $1.4 million pre-tax of this opportunity
in 1994. More importantly, the net interest margin enhancements,
the 50% employee downsizing, the business re-engineerings, and
the processing conversions are substantially completed entering
1995. The annual pre-tax earnings enhancements are not, however,
going to be $3.8 million pre-tax; 

<PAGE>5

commencing in 1995, we estimate them to be closer to $5.0 million
pre-tax. These consolidation economies alone allow for related
recovery of the acquisition's goodwill and core deposit
intangibles in approximately five years. Better still, the
amortization of intangibles are non-cash charges to income and
the savings are real "in your pocket" cash. In hindsight, we
would have been more bullish with our earliest disclosed
intra-market savings estimates.
We began a common stock repurchase plan in July 1994. At the
close of the year, we had repurchased 127,700 of our shares as
treasury stock at a total cost of $3,064,000 or at just under an
average price per share of $24.00, less than our reported book
value per share. Our earnings per share improved because of this
repurchase program. In retrospect, we would have bought more
shares and begun the program earlier.
In hindsight, 1994 was, on balance, a respectable, but not
satisfying year financially for your Company. We positioned
ourselves strategically for continued financial improvement and
the achievement of a progressive total shareholder return in 1995
and beyond. We overcame many challenges and obstacles with the
dedicated support of our shareholders and boards of directors,
the leadership of your management and the committed effort of our
employees. Our fortitude and perseverance were tested by an
unresponsive stock price trend during the latter part of the
year, a trend similar to that observed throughout the banking
industry. But we remain confident in our plans and our people;
and, we will continue our proven strategies with the anticipation
that the market will ultimately rally and reward our progress.

BEYOND THE FINANCES

Your Company is achieving the challenging goal of providing the
progressive total shareholder return investors demand, while
strategically delivering the quality banking services that our
customers expect. This capability results from our success in
applying the resources of a regional $1.8 billion dollar banking
company to a network of small community banks which emphasize
premier quality service delivered on a personal basis. As this
approach guides us into 1995, one of our leading priorities
continues to be the positioning of our banks as invaluable
members within the communities we serve.
Senior management's efforts to position your Company as a
community banking leader are aided by three key elements, all of
which are currently in place: 1) senior management and board
members at each subsidiary live and work within their bank's
service area; 2) each bank offers quality customer service along
with a diverse product line which fosters a total customer
relationship; and 3) each bank is an energetic supporter of
community improvement and creates goodwill within the community
it serves. These three components strengthen the very foundation
that will continue to support future growth and profitability.
The first component of a successful community banking plan
requires active participation in the local community by your
Company's senior management and board of directors. A board
comprised of directors who live and work within the communities
they serve is becoming a rarity within a financial world where
competitors race to grow at all costs. While USBANCORP's holding
company board provides operational support and strategic guidance
for all subsidiaries, each bank's senior officers and local board
are responsible for daily management and the challenge of forging
a stronger bond between the bank and its community. Our 

<PAGE>6

bank boards provide the communities we serve with local
decision-making authority, enabling a quick response to community
needs and providing the assurance that senior management and
board members are accessible to customers.
To address the second component of a successful community banking
plan, your Company is focusing energy on providing a diverse and
useful product line, highlighting customer-friendly "packages of
banking services" that involve our customers in multiple banking
relationships. Research confirms that the greater number of
accounts a customer has with a financial institution, the more
loyal the customer becomes to that financial institution.
Products such as the Three Rivers Bank Direct Deposit Plus, the
U.S. National Bank Value+Plus, and the Community Savings Bank
College Account feature deposit and lending products combined
into one account designed to appeal to a specific segment within
each market area. New product introductions follow this same
approach. The Prestige Banking Account, formally introduced in
1994 at all three affiliates, presents the affluent customer with
a banking package which includes an interest-bearing checking
account, a preferred line of credit, a VISA Gold credit card and
special MAC privileges. All three affiliates have also been
promoting bank accounts packaged for low- and moderate-income
families. By meeting income guidelines, customers become eligible
for low interest personal loans, reduced fee or no fee checking
services and smaller down-payment mortgages. Because each
USBANCORP affiliate is managed at the bank level, each product
can include customized pricing for the bank's own customers and
market conditions. The "packaged" account approach is
successfully developing a more loyal customer base and is
enhancing USBANCORP's reputation as a company which responds to
the banking needs of its communities with practical and
affordable products, delivered by employees dedicated to
providing superior customer service.
Your Company measures its success by the satisfaction that each
customer and each community derives from a banking relationship
with us. A progressive total shareholder return is a direct
result of our success in focusing on our customers and the
communities we serve. Defining what it takes to continuously meet
and exceed customer and community desires has been an active
responsibility throughout 1994. Immediately preceding the
affiliation of U.S. National Bank and Johnstown Savings Bank,
your Company conducted an extensive survey of more than 5,000
U.S. National Bank customers. The first goal of the survey was to
generate marketplace intelligence to objectively develop a
platform of important customer quality values. The second
objective was to establish a baseline quality service measurement
system, and then to develop a comprehensive method of measuring
and tracking future changes against this baseline. During the
fourth quarter of 1994, a similar customer survey was initiated
at both Three Rivers Bank and Community Savings Bank. When asked
about customer service, more than 90 percent of survey
respondents from each bank agreed that the service they receive
meets or exceeds their expectations. Additionally, more than half
of the Three Rivers Bank respondents cited specific instances of
extraordinary service. Examples of extraordinary service also
appeared on half of Community Savings Bank responses, and on more
than one-third of U.S. National Bank surveys. All three survey
programs have provided valuable data on our overall customer
service. In addition, 

<PAGE>7

the surveys also provide useful feedback on specific community
office performance, which will be used to design training
programs to further enhance highly-rated service areas, and to
strengthen areas where improvement would be beneficial. During
1995, a follow-up survey of each bank's customers will chart our
progress in providing superior quality customer service.
A proactive community plan, the third component of a successful
community bank, is paramount to achieving a positive reputation
within each community. Within your Company's plan is a strong
expectation for employee involvement in community charities and
fund raising efforts. Long-term community action is found in
USBANCORP's leadership and daily involvement in economic
development projects within our service communities. There is a
wealth of valuable experience at all levels within our
organization, and you can be assured that your Company is working
intensely in its communities, whether our employees are
instructing a Junior Achievement class at the local high school
or arranging a financial plan for attracting new businesses to
the community. Your Company's Community Reinvestment Act ("CRA")
initiatives have also succeeded in creating a positive reputation
within each community. Specific CRA achievements are many
including: Three Rivers Bank's sponsorship of a small business
development forum which involved local McKeesport community
leaders; Community Savings Bank's receipt of the Pittsburgh
community's Credit Enhancement Program award; and U.S. National
Bank President and CEO Louis Cynkar's receipt of the Volunteer of
the Year Award from Housing Opportunities, Inc., the local
non-profit organization dedicated to helping low- and
moderate-income families realize the dream of home ownership. As
a contributing and caring corporate citizen, USBANCORP's sincere
commitment to our communities is integral to our corporate
philosophy.
The year 1995 will be an exciting, but challenging year for most
financial institutions. A rising rate environment can decrease an
institution's margin of profit. Therefore, selling more products
and services to our existing customers, and attracting new bank
customers, will become key elements for our continued success. To
ensure that this growth occurs, we have added a full-time sales
department whose members will travel daily to community banking
offices to work with the staff to support a retail sales culture.
Building more customer relationships will be an important goal
for 1995, and this effort will be reinforced by a comprehensive
sales incentive program for all employees.
Each employee enters 1995 with a clearly defined agenda for
enhancing the relationship we share with each customer. The
support provided by a centralized holding company will ensure
that each bank can devote the necessary time and resources to
this quality service agenda. Your Company has developed an
organizational strategy which combines the audit, compliance,
purchasing, accounting, investing, marketing, sales and corporate
planning functions for all entities at the holding company level.
The result is an efficient internal delivery system of critical
"back room" operations, reduced expenses through economies of
scale, plus clear and consistent overall policy direction. In
this manner, we are able to enhance our customer service at the
community bank level, while many of the staff functions are more
efficiently maintained within the holding company.

THE 1995 OUTLOOK

We start 1995 with our strategies formulated, a strong,
supportive financial foundation, numerous challenges identified,
and a common stock price which has rebounded to above $22.00 per
share (an approximate 5% improvement just since December 31,
1994). It is our intent to vigorously pursue the following key
strategies during this year:

We will continue to prudently leverage capital through investment
securities purchased by borrowings until the marginal return dips
below 1.50% pre-tax. We will not, however, leverage below an
asset leverage ratio of 6% corporately or at any individual
entity.

We will continue our commitment to a progressive total
shareholder return by maintaining our common dividend at a
slightly higher level than peer. We want to ensure market
recognition of USBANCORP, Inc. as an attractive yielding bank
investment.

We will intensify our past practice of searching for earnings
accretive acquisitions of whole institutions, branches, and
select business lines. Our focus in acquisition efforts will
continue to be timeliness of earnings accretion and our search
will center within the market we presently serve as well as
contiguous counties in western Pennsylvania.

We will initiate more frequent business line profitability
analyses. It is expected that we will have a comprehensive,
automated transfer pricing system fully functional by the end of
1995. We will decisively act upon the results of these analyses,
improving product pricing or lowering delivery costs where
possible and curtailing business lines that are severable and no
longer contributing to an acceptable, progressive total
shareholder return. We have already identified the indirect auto
lending business segment and our recently acquired mortgage
banking subsidiary as two areas which require substantial
re-engineering to meet our return objectives.

We will continue our focus of delivering a diverse and useful
product line and building a base of customers with multiple
banking relationships. Our line personnel will continue to
distinguish themselves by providing quality service that results
in measurable satisfaction beyond customers' expectations and the
standards of our peers.

We will continue to be model corporate citizens within the
communities we serve. We will be involved in our communities and
supportive of important neighborhood programs.

These strategies will be implemented with our characteristic
intensity and resolve. 

We enter 1995 realizing that we face significant, anticipated
challenges:

There will be intensified deposit pricing pressures. We will be
challenged to increase the rate we pay on our core, generally
price inelastic, deposits including NOW accounts, passbooks, and
statement savings. The February 1, 1995, Federal Reserve 50 basis
point rate increase, the seventh since the beginning of 1994
aggregating a total 300 basis point climb, has begun to push
beyond the limit of price

<PAGE>9

inelasticity on core accounts, in contrast to the constant
inelasticity which we enjoyed throughout 1994. Our deposit mix
will pose a further challenge as our customers continue to pursue
higher yield by shifting from lower cost core accounts to
long-term, fixed-rate certificates of deposit with a higher rate.
Consequently, our net interest margin, although generally
expected to modestly improve from the fourth quarter 1994 level
of 3.66%, will continue to be tested, especially if the Federal
Reserve's fight against inflation did not end on February 1.

There will be business mix pressures given our 43% (of total
loans outstanding) fixed-rate, long-term residential mortgage
concentration. We will seek all prudent methods to bring our
lending mix to a preferred 33% consumer, 33% commercial, and 33%
mortgage blend. This lending diversification challenge will be
substantial, especially if the Federal Reserve succeeds in
measurably slowing the economy and loan demand, and the thirty
year treasury rate remains above 7.25%. We anticipate that our
efforts in this area will extend beyond 1995.
There will be lending growth pressures. In 1994, excluding the
effects of any acquisitions or the sale of the student loan
portfolio, we increased loans outstanding by $32 million or 4.4%.
We will be challenged to underwrite 5% loan growth in 1995.
Competitive challenges, the re-engineering of our indirect loan
operations, and a successful Federal Reserve effort at slowing
economic growth, if achieved in 1995, will all exacerbate these
pressures.
While recognizing the magnitude of these identified challenges,
and realizing that other unforeseeable travails will reveal
themselves throughout this year, we are cautiously optimistic
that 1995, by most measures, will be better than our respectable
1994. We also recognize that hindsight one year hence may again
prove to be a valued teacher.
In conclusion, I want to thank our dedicated employees and
directors for their tireless efforts and you, our shareholder,
for your support.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AT AND FOR THE YEARS
ENDED DECEMBER 31, 1994, 1993 AND 1992

1. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

Business:
USBANCORP, Inc. (the "Company") and its subsidiaries' operations
relate primarily to commercial banking activities which represent
one industry segment.
Principles of Consolidation:
The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the
Company and its wholly-owned subsidiaries, United States National
Bank in Johnstown ("U.S. Bank"), Three Rivers Bank and Trust
Company ("Three Rivers Bank"), Community Bancorp, Inc.
("Community"), USBANCORP Trust Company ("Trust Company"), and
United Bancorp Life Insurance Company ("United Life").
Intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated in
preparing the consolidated financial statements.
Investment Securities:
Effective January 1, 1994, the Company adopted SFAS #115,
"Accounting for Certain Investments in Debt and Equity
Securities," which specifies a methodology for the classification
of securities as either held to maturity, available for sale, or
as trading assets. Securities are classified at the time of
purchase as investment securities held to maturity if it is
management's intent and the Company has the ability to hold the
securities until maturity. These held to maturity securities are
carried on the Company's books at cost, adjusted for amortization
of premium and accretion of discount on a straight-line basis,
which is not materially different from the level yield method.
Alternatively, securities are classified as available for sale if
it is management's intent at the time of purchase to hold the
securities for an indefinite period of time and/or to use the
securities as part of the Company's asset/liability management
strategy. Securities classified as available for sale include
securities which may be sold to effectively manage interest rate
risk exposure, prepayment risk, and other factors (such as
liquidity requirements). These available for sale securities are
reported at fair value with unrealized aggregate appreciation
(depreciation) excluded from income and credited (charged) to a
separate component of shareholders' equity on a net of tax basis.
Any security classified as trading assets are reported at fair
value with unrealized aggregate appreciation (depreciation)
included in current income on a net of tax basis. The Company
presently does not engage in trading activity. The increase in
the carrying value of the available for sale portfolio upon
adoption of SFAS #115 was approximately $2.6 million.

Prior to this adoption, the securities portfolio was classified
as available for sale, and carried at the lower of amortized cost
or market value. Any unrealized holding period adjustments were
reflected in "Net unrealized gain or loss on investment
securities available for sale" on the Consolidated Statement of
Income. Realized gain or loss on securities sold is computed upon
the adjusted cost of the specific securities sold.
Loans:
Interest income is recognized using methods which approximate a
level yield related to principal amounts outstanding. The
subsidiaries immediately discontinue the accrual of interest
income when loans, except for loans that are insured for credit
loss, become 90 days past due in either principal or interest. In
addition, if circumstances warrant, the accrual of interest may
be discontinued prior to 90 days. In all cases, payments received
on non-accrual loans are credited to principal until full
recovery of principal has been recognized; it is only after full
recovery of principal that any additional payments received are
recognized as interest income. A non-accrual loan is placed on
accrual status after becoming current and remaining current for
twelve consecutive payments (except for residential mortgage
loans which have to become current and remain current for six
consecutive payments) and upon the approval of the Credit
Committee and/or Board Discount/Loan Committee with final
approval resting with the Chief Financial Officer.
Loan Fees:
Loan origination and commitment fees, net of associated direct
costs, are deferred and amortized into interest and fees on loans
over the loan or commitment period. Fee amortization is
determined by either the straight-line method, or the effective
interest method, which do not differ materially.
Mortgage Loans Held For Sale:
All newly originated 30 year fixed-rate residential mortgage
loans are classified as "held for sale." It is management's
intent to periodically sell these residential mortgage loans and
retain servicing rights for the remaining lives; this strategy
will be executed in an effort to help neutralize long-term
interest rate risk. The residential mortgage loans held for sale
are carried at the lower of aggregate cost or market value.
Realized gains and losses are calculated by the specific
identification method and are included in "Net realized gain or
loss on loans held for sale"; unrealized net valuation
adjustments (if any) are recorded in the same line item on the
Consolidated Statement of Income.
Premises and Equipment:
Premises and equipment are stated at cost less accumulated
depreciation and amortization. Depreciation is charged to
operations over the estimated useful lives of the premises and
equipment using the straight-line method. Useful lives of up to
45 years for buildings and up to 12 years for equipment are
utilized. Leasehold improvements are amortized using the
straight-line method over the terms of the respective leases or
useful lives of the improvements, whichever is shorter.
Maintenance, repairs, and minor alterations are charged to
current operations as expenditures are incurred. 
Allowance for Loan Losses and Charge-off Procedures:
As a financial institution which assumes lending and credit risks
as a principal element in its business, the Company anticipates
that credit losses will be experienced in the normal course of
business. Accordingly, management of        

<PAGE>21

the Company makes a quarterly determination as to an appropriate
provision from earnings necessary to maintain an allowance for
loan losses which would be adequate for potential yet
undetermined losses. The amount charged against earnings is based
upon several factors including, at a minimum, each of the
following:
A continuing review of delinquent, classified and nonperforming
loans, large loans, and overall portfolio quality. This
continuous review assesses the risk characteristics of both
individual loans and the total loan portfolio.
Regular examinations and reviews of the loan portfolio by
representatives of the regulatory authorities.
Analytical review of loan charge-off experience, delinquency
rates, and other relevant historical and peer statistical ratios.
Management's judgment with respect to local and general economic
conditions and their impact on the existing loan portfolio.
When it is determined that the prospects of recovery of the
principal of a loan have significantly diminished, the loan is
immediately charged against the allowance account and subsequent
recoveries, if any, are credited to the allowance account. Loans
are charged-off promptly upon determination that a loss is
anticipated. In addition, non-accrual and large delinquent loans
are reviewed monthly to determine potential losses. Consumer
loans are considered losses when they are 90 days past due,
except loans that are insured for credit loss.
Purchased Mortgage Servicing Rights:
Purchased mortgage servicing rights associated with loan
servicing acquired in the secondary mortgage market are
capitalized. The amount capitalized upon the purchase of mortgage
servicing rights is equal to the price paid to unaffiliated
sellers. The purchased mortgage servicing rights are amortized as
an adjustment of future servicing income using a method that
approximates the interest method over the life of the related
loans, adjusted for estimated prepayments.
Trust Fees:
All trust fees are recorded on the cash basis which approximates
the accrual basis for such income.
Earnings Per Common Share:
Primary earnings per share amounts are computed by dividing net
income, after deducting preferred stock dividend requirements, by
the weighted average number of common stock and common stock
equivalent shares outstanding. Fully diluted earnings per share
amounts are calculated for 1993 and 1992 assuming that the Series
A $2.125 Cumulative Convertible Non-Voting Preferred Stock was
converted at the beginning of the year into 1.136 shares of the
Company's Common Stock and that no preferred dividends were paid.
By April 7, 1993, all Preferred Stock was either redeemed or
converted to the Company's Common Stock.
Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows:
On a consolidated basis, cash equivalents include cash and due
from banks, interest bearing deposits with banks, and federal
funds sold and securities purchased under agreements to resell;
for the Company, cash equivalents include short-term investments.
The Company made $3,210,000 in federal income tax payments in
1994; $4,300,000 in 1993; and $3,986,000 in 1992. The Company
made total interest expense payments of $45,953,000 in 1994;
$34,153,000 in 1993; and $40,942,000 in 1992.
Income Taxes:
As discussed in Note 13, the Company adopted Statement of
Financial Accounting Standards #109, "Accounting for Income
Taxes" on January 1, 1993. Under SFAS #109, deferred tax assets
or liabilities are computed based on the difference between the
financial statement and income tax bases of assets and
liabilities using the enacted marginal tax rate. Deferred income
tax expenses or credits are based on the changes in the asset or
liability from period to period. Prior to 1993, deferred income
tax expenses or credits were recorded to reflect the tax
consequences of timing differences between the recording of
income and expenses for financial reporting purposes and for
purposes of filing federal income tax returns at income tax rates
in effect when the difference arose.
Interest Rate Contracts:
The Company uses various interest rate contracts, such as
interest rate swaps, caps and floors, to help manage interest
rate and market valuation risk exposure, which is incurred in
normal recurrent banking activities. These interest rate
contracts function as hedges against specific assets or
liabilities on the Company's Balance Sheet. Gains or losses on
these hedge transactions are deferred and recognized as
adjustments to interest income or interest expense of the
underlying assets or liabilities over the hedge period.
For interest rate swaps, the interest differential to be paid or
received is accrued by the Company and recognized as an
adjustment to interest income or interest expense of the
underlying assets or liabilities being hedged. Since only
interest payments are exchanged, the cash requirement and
exposure to credit risk are significantly less than the notional
amount.
Any premium or transaction fee incurred to purchase interest rate
caps or floors are deferred and amortized to interest income or
interest expense over the term of the contract. Unamortized
premiums related to the purchase of caps and floors are included
in other assets on the Consolidated Balance Sheet.

In April of 1994, the Company transferred $139 million of
securities from available for sale into held to maturity. The
unrealized holding loss on the securities at the date of transfer
amounted to $2.8 million and is being amortized over the
remaining life of the securities as an adjustment of yield.

<PAGE>23

All purchased investment securities are recorded on settlement
date which is not materially different from the trade date.
Realized gains and losses are calculated by the specific
identification method and are included in "Net realized gain or
loss on investment securities."
Maintaining investment quality is a primary objective of the
Company's investment policy which, subject to certain limited
exceptions, prohibits the purchase of any investment security
below a Moody's Investors Service or Standard & Poor's rating of
"A." At December 31, 1994, 96.1% of the portfolio was rated "AAA"
and 97.0% "AA" or higher as compared to 89.2% and 91.0%,
respectively, at December 31, 1993. Only 0.5% of the portfolio
was rated below "A" or unrated on December 31, 1994.
The book value of securities pledged to secure public and trust
deposits, as required by law, was $275,210,000 at December 31,
1994, and $83,769,000 at December 31, 1993. The Company realized
$1,029,000 and $827,000 of gross investment security gains and
$5,001,000 and $244,000 of gross investment security losses on
available for sale securities in 1994 and 1993, respectively.
The average maturity distribution at amortized cost of the
investment securities available for sale and held to maturity at
December 31, 1994, was $40,974,000 and $7,790,000 within one
year; $190,825,000 and $310,358,000 within one to five years;
$31,498,000 and $160,655,000 within five to ten years; and
$5,267,000 and $45,835,000 after ten years, respectively. Refer

</TABLE>

Real estate construction loans were not material at these
presented dates and comprised 2.3% and 2.5% of total loans net of
unearned income at December 31, 1994, and 1993, respectively. The
Company has no credit exposure to foreign countries or highly
leveraged transactions. Additionally, the Company has no
significant industry lending concentrations.
In the ordinary course of business, the subsidiaries have
transactions, including loans, with their officers, directors,
and their affiliated companies. These transactions were on
substantially the same terms as those prevailing at the time for
comparable transactions with unaffiliated parties and do not
involve more than the normal credit risk. These loans totaled
$14,955,000 and $15,074,000 at December 31, 1994, and 1993,
respectively. An analysis of these related party loans follows:

An analysis of the changes in the allowance for loan losses

</TABLE>

In the fourth quarter 1994, the Company recognized a one-time
non-recurring negative loan loss provision of $4,000,000. This
action caused the provision for the full year 1994 to be
$(2,765,000). For further comprehensive discussion see "Allowance
for Loan Losses and Provision" within the Management's Discussion
and Analysis.
Effective January 1, 1995, the Company adopted SFAS #114,
"Accounting by Creditors for Impairment of a Loan." SFAS #114
defines the term "impaired loan" and indicates the method used to
measure the impairment. The measurement of impairment may be
based upon: 1) the present value of expected future cash flows
discounted at the loan's effective interest rate; 2) the
observable market price of the impaired loan; or 3) the fair
value of the collateral of a collateral dependent loan. The
adoption of this standard is not expected to have a material
impact on the Company's financial statements.

7. NON-PERFORMING ASSETS
Non-performing assets are comprised of (i) loans which are on a
non-accrual basis, (ii) consumer loans which are contractually
past due 90 days or more as to interest or principal payments and
which are insured for credit loss, and (iii) other real estate
owned (real estate acquired through foreclosure and in-substance
foreclosures). All loans, except for loans that are insured for
credit loss, are placed on non-accrual status immediately upon
becoming 90 days past due in either principal or interest. In
addition, if circumstances warrant, the accrual of interest may
be discontinued prior to 90 days. In all cases, payments received
on non-accrual loans are credited to principal until full
recovery of principal has been recognized; it is only after full
recovery of principal that any additional payments received are
recognized as interest income.

<PAGE>24

The following table presents information concerning
non-performing assets:

balance            225,269   -         28,590    -      12,005    -
</TABLE>

Average amounts outstanding during the year represent daily
averages. Average interest rates represent interest expense
divided by the related average balances.
Included in the year-end balance were $69,000,000 Flexline
overnight borrowings and $107,455,000 reverse repurchase
agreements from the Federal Home Loan Bank.
Also included in the above borrowings is a $17,539,000
outstanding balance on a $25 million mortgage warehouse line of
credit at Standard Mortgage Corporation (a mortgage banking
subsidiary of Community). This line of credit bears interest at a
rate of 1.625% on the used portion for which a compensating
balance is maintained and prime rate on the used portion for
which no compensating balance is maintained. This line of credit,
which expires July 1, 1995, is secured by Standard Mortgage
Corporation inventory, servicing rights, and commitments.
Compensating balances held by the lender are used in determining
the interest rates charged on the mortgage warehouse lines of
credit and a bank note (discussed in Footnote 11). These
balances, which are derived from customer escrow balances,
amounts of collections in transit on loans serviced and corporate
cash balances, can further decrease the interest rate charged on
the line of credit if the compensating balance is maintained at a
level greater than the used portion of the line.
These borrowing transactions range from overnight to six months
in maturity. The average maturity was sixty-eight days at the end
of 1994, two days at the end of 1993, and eight days at the end
of 1992.

All Federal Home Loan Bank stock and an interest in unspecified
mortgage loans, with an aggregate statutory value equal to the
amount of the advances, have been pledged as collateral with the
Federal Home Loan Bank of Pittsburgh.
Collateralized Mortgage Obligation:
The collateralized mortgage obligation was issued through
Community First Capital Corporation ("CFCC"), a wholly- owned,
single-purpose finance subsidiary of Community Savings Bank.
Community Savings Bank transferred in 1988 Federal Home Loan
Mortgage Corporation ("FHLMC") securities with a book value of
approximately $31,500,000 to CFCC which were then used as
collateral for issuance of bonds with a par value of $27,787,000
in the form of a collateralized mortgage obligation.
There are four classes of bonds, including one class of zero
coupon bonds, which mature in the years 2000 through 2018;
however, payments of the bonds may occur prior to maturity in
accordance with certain provisions of the Trust Indenture between
CFCC and the trustee. The remaining bonds have a weighted average
adjusted effective rate of 10.25%.
Assets held in trust for the collateralized mortgage obligation
consist of the following:

Under provisions of the Trust Indenture, the bonds are fully
collateralized by the FHLMC securities and funds held by the
trustee. Funds held by the trustee represent payments received on
FHLMC securities, collateral reserves, and reinvestment of
earnings on such funds which have not been applied to pay
principal and interest on the bonds. These funds are restricted
to assure payment on the bonds in accordance with the Indenture.

Long-Term Debt:
The Company's long-term debt consisted of the following:

</TABLE>

One bank note evidences a $4 million loan to partially finance
the acquisition of Community Bancorp, Inc.,which has a current
principal balance of $1,988,000. The loan originally was payable
in equal quarterly amounts of principal and interest of
approximately $196,000 through April 1999 and had a fixed annual
interest rate of 9.50%. On August 31, 1993, the Company
refinanced this note and shortened the maturity date to July 31,
1996, and reduced the interest rate to one that floats at the
Prime Rate. The Company paid a prepayment premium of $170,000 to
effect these favorable modifications to the original note.
The other bank note evidences a $9 million non-revolving
commercial loan commitment at Standard Mortgage Corporation of
Georgia of which the current outstanding balance of $3,611,000 is
payable monthly in fixed principal installments of $144,000
through January 15, 1997. The commercial loan bears interest at
3% on the used portion for which a compensating balance is
maintained and Prime Rate for which no compensating balance is
maintained. This loan is secured by Standard Mortgage Corporation
mortgage inventory, servicing rights, and commitments.
Scheduled maturities of long-term debt for the years subsequent
to December 31, 1994, are $2,825,000 in 1995; $2,505,000 in 1996;
$446,000 in 1997; and $30,000 in 1998.

12. DISCLOSURES ABOUT FAIR VALUE OF FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS
Statement of Financial Accounting Standards #107, "Disclosures
about Fair Value of Financial Instruments," requires all entities
to disclose the estimated fair value of its financial instrument
assets and liabilities. For the Company, as for most financial
institutions, approximately 95% of its assets and liabilities are
considered financial instruments as defined in SFAS #107. Many of
the Company's financial instruments, however, lack an available
trading market as characterized by a willing buyer and willing
seller engaging in an exchange transaction. Therefore,
significant estimations and present value calculations were used
by the Company for the purpose of this disclosure.
Estimated fair values have been determined by the Company using
the best available data, as generally provided in the Company's
FRY-9C Regulatory Reports, and an estimation methodology suitable
for each category of financial instruments. Management believes
that cash, cash equivalents, and loans and deposits with floating
interest rates have estimated fair values which approximate the
recorded book balances. The estimation methodologies used, the
estimated fair values, and recorded book balances at December 31,
1994, and 1993, were as follows:

Financial instruments actively traded in a secondary market have
been valued using quoted available market prices.

Purchased mortgage servicing rights have been valued by an
independent third party using a methodology which incorporates a
discounted after-tax cash flow of the servicing (loan servicing
fees and other related ancillary fee income less the costs of
servicing the loans). This valuation also assumes current PSA
prepayment speeds which are based upon industry data collected on
mortgage prepayment trends.

Changes in assumptions or estimation methodologies may have a
material effect on these estimated fair values.
The Company's remaining assets and liabilities which are not
considered financial instruments have not been valued differently
than has been customary with historical cost accounting. No
disclosure of the relationship value of the Company's deposits is
required by SFAS #107. Because of the Company's stable core
deposit base (which comprises 97% of total deposits), its non-use
of volatile funding sources such as
 brokered deposits, and a peer comparable cost of deposits
(actual cost in 1994 of 3.47% vs. a peer average of 3.29% as of
September 30, 1994), management believes the relationship value
of these deposits is significant. Based upon the Company's most
recent acquisitions and other limited secondary market
transactions involving similar deposits, management estimates the
relationship value of these funding liabilities to range between
$41 million to $87 million less than their estimated fair value
shown at December 31, 1994. The estimated fair value of
off-balance sheet financial instruments, used for hedging
purposes, is estimated by obtaining quotes from brokers. These
values represent the estimated amount the Company would receive
or pay, to terminate the agreements, considering current interest
rates, as well as, the creditworthiness of the counterparties. At
December 31, 1994, the notional value of the Company's
off-balance sheet financial instruments (interest rate swaps and
caps) totalled $110 million with an estimated fair value of
$61,000. There is no material difference between the notional
amount and the estimated fair value of the remaining off-balance
sheet items which total $161.8 million and are primarily
comprised of unfunded loan commitments which are generally priced
at market at the time of funding.
Management is concerned that reasonable comparability of these
disclosed fair values between financial institutions may not be
likely due to the wide range of permitted valuation techniques
and numerous estimates which must be made given the absence of
active secondary markets for many of the financial instruments.
This lack of uniform valuation methodologies also introduces a
greater degree of subjectivity to these estimated fair values.

The disposition of certain marketable securities acquired in the
acquisition of Johnstown Savings Bank caused a loss of
approximately $10 million for tax reporting purposes. This loss
was the primary factor that reduced 1994 taxable income to a
level that generated an alternative minimum tax liability of
approximately $1,050,000. This minimum tax is expected to be
recovered in future years and has been included in net deferred
tax assets at December 31, 1994.
Deferred income taxes result from temporary differences in the
recognition of revenue and expense for tax and financial
reporting purposes. The following table presents the impact on
income tax expense of the principal timing differences and the
tax effect of each:

</TABLE>

Effective January 1, 1993, the Company adopted Statement of
Financial Accounting Standards #109, "Accounting for Income
Taxes." SFAS #109 utilizes the liability method and deferred
taxes are determined based on the estimated future tax effects of
differences between the financial statement and income tax bases
of assets and liabilities given the provisions of the enacted tax
laws. This adoption resulted in the recognition of a
non-recurring net benefit of $1,452,000 or $0.35 per share on a
fully diluted basis. The effect of this standard on income tax
expense (exclusive of the cumulative effect adjustment) for the
year ended December 31, 1993, was not material.
In August 1993, Congress passed the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation
Act of 1993 which increased the corporate tax rate from 34% to
35% on income greater than $10 million. As a result of this
increase in the tax rate, the Company recognized an approximate
$100,000 addition to the net deferred tax asset. This caused a
corresponding benefit to the provision for income taxes.

14. PENSION AND PROFIT SHARING PLANS
U.S. Bank:
U.S. Bank has a trusteed, noncontributory defined benefit pension
plan covering all employees who work at least 1,000 hours per
year for U.S. Bank or the Company and who have not yet reached
age 60 at their employment date. The benefits of the plan are
based upon the employee's years of service and average annual
earnings for the highest five consecutive calendar years during
the final ten-year period of employment. U.S. Bank's plan funding
policy has been to contribute annually an amount within the
statutory range of allowable minimum and maximum actuarially
determined tax deductible contributions. Plan assets are
primarily debt securities (including U.S. Agency and Treasury
securities, corporate notes and bonds), listed common stocks
(including shares of USBANCORP, Inc. common stock), mutual funds,
and short-term cash equivalent instruments.
Net periodic pension cost for the plan is as follows:

The above pension disclosures include the information for the
supplemental plan for certain management employees which was
implemented January 1, 1992.
U.S. Bank also has a trusteed deferred profit sharing plan with
contributions made by U.S. Bank based upon income as defined in
the plan. All employees of U.S. Bank and the Company who work
over 1,000 hours per year participate in the plan beginning on
January 1 following six months of service. Contributions to this
profit sharing plan were $584,000 in 1994; $489,000 in 1993; and
$500,000 in 1992. Plan assets are primarily debt securities
(including U.S. Agency and Treasury securities, corporate notes
and bonds), listed common stocks (including shares of USBANCORP,
Inc. common stock), mutual funds, and short-term cash equivalent
instruments.
Three Rivers Bank and Community Savings Bank
(the Western Region Subsidiaries):
The Western Region Subsidiaries have a trusteed, noncontributory
defined benefit pension plan covering all employees who work at
least 1,000 hours per year and who have not yet reached age 60 at
their employment date. The benefits of the plan are based upon
the employee's years of service and average annual earnings for
the highest five consecutive calendar years during the final
ten-year period of employment. The Western Region Subsidiaries'
plan funding policy has been to contribute annually an amount
within the statutory range of allowable minimum and maximum
actuarially determined tax-deductible contributions. Plan assets
are primarily debt securities (including U.S. Agency and Treasury
securities, corporate notes and bonds), listed common stocks
(including shares of USBANCORP, Inc. common stock), mutual funds,
and short-term cash equivalent instruments.
Net periodic pension cost for the plan is as follows:

The above pension disclosures include the information for the
supplemental plan for certain management employees which was
implemented July 1, 1993.
Additionally, prior to July 1, 1993, eligible Community employees
participated in a non-contributory defined multi-employer pension
plan. The net pension cost for contributions made to the plan
amounted to $80,000 for the six month period in 1993. Effective
July 1, 1993, Community's employees were merged into the Three
Rivers Bank pension plan.

<PAGE>32

The Western Region Subsidiaries also have a trusteed 401(k) plan
with contributions made by Western Region Subsidiaries matching
those by eligible employees up to a maximum of 50% of the first
6% of their annual salary. All employees of the Western Region
Subsidiaries who work over 1,000 hours per year are eligible to
participate in the plan beginning on January 1 following six
months of service.  The Western Region Subsidiaries contribution
to this 401(k) plan was $79,000 in 1994; $27,000 in 1993; and
$24,000 in 1992.
Except for the above pension benefits provided by each
subsidiary, the Company has no significant additional exposure
for any other post-retirement benefits.
15. LEASE COMMITMENTS
The Company's obligation for future minimum lease payments on
operating leases at December 31, 1994, is as follows:

<TABLE>
<CAPTION>

Year                            Future Minimum Lease Payments

<S>                             <C>

1996                            873
1997                            730
1998                            354
1999 and thereafter (in total)  627
</TABLE>

In addition to the amounts set forth above, certain of the leases
require payments by the Company for taxes, insurance, and
maintenance.
Rent expense included in total non-interest expense amounted to
$540,000, $493,000, and $414,000 in 1994, 1993, and 1992,
respectively.

16. COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENT LIABILITIES
The Company's banking subsidiaries incur off-balance sheet risks
in the normal course of business in order to meet the financing
needs of their customers. These risks derive from commitments to
extend credit and standby letters of credit. Such commitments and
standby letters of credit involve, to varying degrees, elements
of credit risk in excess of the amount recognized in the
consolidated financial statements.
Commitments to extend credit are obligations to lend to a
customer as long as there is no violation of any condition
established in the loan agreement. Commitments generally have
fixed expiration dates or other termination clauses and may
require payment of a fee. Since many of the commitments are
expected to expire without being drawn upon, the total commitment
amounts do not necessarily represent future cash requirements.
The banking subsidiaries evaluate each customer's
creditworthiness on a case-by-case basis. Collateral which
secures these types of commitments is the same as for other types
of secured lending such as accounts receivable, inventory, and
fixed assets.
Standby letters of credit are conditional commitments issued by
the banking subsidiaries to guarantee the performance of a
customer to a third party. Those guarantees are primarily issued
to support public and private borrowing arrangements, including
normal business activities, bond financings, and similar
transactions. The credit risk involved in issuing letters of
credit is essentially the same as that involved in extending
loans to customers. Letters of credit are issued both on an
unsecured and secured basis. Collateral securing these types of
transactions is similar to collateral securing the subsidiary
banks' commercial loans.
The Company's exposure to credit loss in the event of
nonperformance by the other party to these commitments to extend
credit and standby letters of credit is represented by their
contractual amounts. The banking subsidiaries use the same credit
and collateral policies in making commitments and conditional
obligations as for all other lending. The Company had outstanding
various commitments to extend credit approximating $161,826,000
and standby letters of credit of $6,419,000 as of December 31,
1994.
Additionally, the Company is also subject to a number of asserted
and unasserted potential claims encountered in the normal course
of business. In the opinion of management and legal counsel,
neither the resolution of these claims nor the funding of these
credit commitments will have a material adverse effect on the
Company's consolidated financial position or results of
operation.

17.INCENTIVE STOCK OPTION PLAN
In 1991, the Company's Board of Directors adopted an Incentive
Stock Option Plan authorizing the grant of options covering
128,000 shares of common stock. Under the Plan, options can be
granted (the "Grant Date") to employees with executive,
managerial, technical, or professional responsibility, as
selected by a committee of the Board of Directors. The option
price at which a stock option may be exercised shall be a price
as determined by the board committee, but shall not be less than
100% of the fair market value per share of common stock on the
Grant Date. The maximum term of any option granted under the Plan
cannot exceed 10 years. The following stock option activity was
recognized (amounts not rounded):

On or after the first anniversary of the Grant Date, one-third of
such options may be exercised. On or after the second anniversary
of the Grant Date, two-thirds of such options may be exercised
minus the aggregate number of such options previously exercised.
On or after the third anniversary of the Grant Date, the
remainder of the options may be exercised.
18.PREFERRED STOCK
On November 20, 1992, the Board of Directors authorized the
redemption of all outstanding shares of the Company's Series A
$2.125 Cumulative Convertible Non-Voting Preferred Stock. The
redemption date was established as April 7, 1993. The Preferred
Stock redemption presented shareholders with the choice of either
redeeming their shares at the redemption price of $25.638 per
share or converting their shares into 1.136 shares of the
Company's Common Stock. Shareholders of only 53,283 shares opted
to redeem their shares resulting in a redemption payout of
approximately $1.4 million; shareholders of 498,717 shares
(approximately 90%) elected to convert their shares. This
conversion resulted in the issuance of 566,543 new common shares.
19.DIVIDEND REINVESTMENT PLAN
The Company's Dividend Reinvestment and Common Stock Purchase
Plan provides each record holder of Common Stock with a simple
and convenient method of purchasing additional shares without
payment of any brokerage commissions, service charges or other
similar expense. A participant in the Plan may purchase shares of
Common Stock by electing either to (1) reinvest dividends on all
of his or her shares of Common Stock or (2) to make optional cash
payments of not less than $10 each purchase up to a maximum of
$2,000 per month and continue to receive regular dividend
payments on his or her other shares. Participants who enroll to
reinvest dividends may also make optional cash payments of not
less than $10 each purchase up to a maximum of $2,000 per month.
A participant may withdraw from the Plan at any time.
Shares purchased under the Plan will be acquired at a three
percent (3%) discount from the average market price.
In the case of purchases from USBANCORP, Inc. of treasury or
newly-issued shares of Common Stock, the average market price is
determined by averaging the high and low sale price of the Common
Stock as reported on the NASDAQ on the relevant investment date.
At December 31, 1994, the Company had 263,048 unissued reserved
shares available under the Plan. In the case of purchases of
shares of Common Stock on the open market, the average market
price will be the weighted average purchase price of shares
purchased for the Plan in the market for the relevant investment
date.

20. SHAREHOLDER RIGHTS PLAN
Each share of the Company's Common Stock had attached to it one
right (a "Right") issued pursuant to a Shareholder Protection
Rights Agreement, dated November 10, 1989 (the "Rights
Agreement"). Each Right entitled a holder to buy one-tenth of a
share of the Company's Series B Preferred Stock at a price of
$40.00, subject to adjustment (the "Exercise Price"). The Rights
became exercisable if a person, group, or other entity acquired
or announced a tender offer for 20% or more of the Company's
Common Stock. They could also have been exercised if a person or
group who had become a beneficial owner of at least 10% of the
Company's Common Stock was declared by the Board of Directors to
be an "adverse person" (as defined in the Rights Agreement).
Under the Rights Agreement, any person, group, or entity would be
deemed a beneficial owner of the Company's Common Stock if such
person, group, or entity would be deemed to beneficially own the
Company's Common Stock under the rules of the Securities and
Exchange Commission which generally require that such person,
group, or entity have, or have the right to acquire within sixty
days, voting or dispositive power of the Company's Common Stock;
provided, however, that the Rights Agreement excluded from the
definition of beneficial owner, holders of revocable proxies,
employee benefit plans of the Company or its subsidiaries and the
Trust Company. After the Rights became exercisable, the Rights
(other than rights held by a 20% beneficial owner or an "adverse
person") would entitle the holders to purchase, under certain
circumstances, either the Company's Common Stock or common stock
of the potential acquirer having a value equal to twice the
Exercise Price. The Company was generally entitled to redeem the
Rights at $.01 per Right at any time until the twentieth business
day following public announcement that a 20% position had been
acquired or the Board of Directors had designated a holder of the
Company's Common Stock an adverse person. The Rights expired on
November 10, 1994. 
On February 24, 1995, the Company's Board of Directors adopted a
Shareholder Rights Plan which is substantially similar to and
replaces the previous Rights Agreement which expired on November
10, 1994. The only significant difference from the previous
Rights Agreement is that under the new plan each right will
initially entitle shareholders to buy one unit of a newly
authorized series of junior participating preferred stock at an
exercise price of $65.00. The rights attached to shares of
USBANCORP common stock outstanding on March 15, 1995, and will
expire in ten years. The Rights Plan may have the effect of
deterring or discouraging a non-negotiated tender or exchange
offer for the Company, the acquisition of a large block of the
Company's Common Stock, and the removal of the Company's
management.

21. COMMUNITY BANCORP, INC. MERGER
Effective as of the beginning of business on March 23, 1992, the
Company merged Community Bancorp, Inc. with and into a newly
formed subsidiary of the Company with Community surviving the
merger. Community Bancorp, Inc., a Pennsylvania corporation, is a
registered bank holding company under the Bank Holding Company
Act of 1956, as amended, whose sole direct subsidiary is
Community (formerly Community Savings Association), a
Pennsylvania-chartered FDIC-insured savings bank. Community had
the following direct subsidiaries: Community First Capital
Corporation (a special purpose finance subsidiary), Community
First Financial Corporation (a subsidiary engaged in real estate
joint ventures), and Frontier Consumer Discount Company. In
accordance with Federal Reserve Board policy, the Company has
committed to divest its equity investment in Community First
Financial Corporation by March 22, 1995, or such longer period as
the Federal Reserve Board may approve.
The Company acquired all of the outstanding common stock and
stock options of Community Bancorp, Inc. with Community Bancorp,
Inc. shareholders receiving $14.1 million in cash and 388,213
shares of the Company's common stock. The total acquisition cost
was $21,709,000. The acquisition was accounted for by the
purchase accounting method and, accordingly, Community's assets
and liabilities have been adjusted to their estimated fair values
at the effective date. The fair value of Community's net assets
acquired exceeded the purchase price by $2,677,000 which reduced
the value assigned to the premises and equipment of Community.
The results of operations of Community for the period from March
23, 1992, through December 31, 1992, amounting to $2,980,000 of
net income, was included in the Company's 1992 income statement.
The pro forma combined results of operations of the Company for
the year ended December 31, 1992, after giving effect to the pro
forma adjustments as of the beginning of the period, are as
follows:

22. BRANCHES ACQUISITION
On April 2, 1993, the Company's Three Rivers Bank subsidiary and
Integra National Bank/Pittsburgh consummated the acquisition of
four Integra branch offices ("Integra") located in the suburban
Pittsburgh market area pursuant to a Purchase and Assumption
Agreement (the "Agreement"). In connection with the transaction,
Three Rivers Bank assumed $88.6 million in deposit liabilities
and purchased $12.1 million of assets; these assets consisted of:
home equity and other consumer loans; vault cash; furniture,
fixtures, and equipment; real estate together with improvements;
and safe deposit box business. In addition, Three Rivers Bank
assumed certain other liabilities including contracts that relate
to the operation of the branches and real estate leases relating
to one branch and one ATM. In consideration for the assumption of
the deposit liabilities, Three Rivers Bank paid Integra a deposit
premium of 1.4% or $1.2 million.

23. JOHNSTOWN SAVINGS BANK ("JSB") 
ACQUISITION
For financial reporting purposes, the Merger ("Merger") with JSB
was consummated and control was passed to USBANCORP on June 30,
1994. USBANCORP merged JSB with and into U.S. Bank, a
wholly-owned subsidiary of USBANCORP, with U.S. Bank surviving
the Merger. The separate existence of JSB ceased, and all
property, rights, powers, duties, obligations, and liabilities of
JSB were automatically transferred to U.S. Bank, in accordance
with Federal and Pennsylvania law. Immediately following the
Merger, U.S. Bank caused the intracompany sale by Standard
Mortgage Corporation of Georgia, a wholly-owned subsidiary of
JSB, of all its assets, subject to all of its liabilities, to SMC
Acquisition Corporation, an indirect subsidiary of Community. SMC
Acquisition Corporation was renamed Standard Mortgage Corporation
of Georgia and is a mortgage banking company organized under the
laws of the State of Georgia and originates, sells, and services
residential mortgage loans.
The Merger was treated as a purchase for financial accounting
purposes. The recorded purchase price was based on the average of
the closing price of USBANCORP Common Stock ("UBAN") on the
NASDAQ/NMS for the ten trading days immediately preceding July
11, 1994, the final closing date of the transaction. The ten day
average of USBANCORP's Common Stock was $25.125, which resulted
in a total cost of the acquisition being $43.8 million, which was
represented by the issuance of 957,857 common shares and $19.7
million in cash. Accounting for the acquisition as a purchase,
USBANCORP recognized newly created core deposit intangibles of
$5.7 million and goodwill of $20.2 million and began realizing
net income immediately from July 1, 1994. Furthermore, the
Company incurred approximately $2.4 million of additional
restructuring expenses during 1994 as a result of the JSB
acquisition including employee severance, data processing
conversion costs, marketing and advertising expenses, and other
costs. These costs are included in the line item titled
"Acquisition charge" in the accompanying Consolidated Statement
of Income.

24. GOODWILL AND CORE DEPOSIT 
INTANGIBLE ASSETS
USBANCORP's balance sheet shows both tangible assets (such as
loans, buildings, and investments) and intangible assets (such as
goodwill). The Company now carries $20.7 million of goodwill and
$6.3 million of core deposit intangible assets on its balance
sheet. The majority of these intangible assets came from the 1994
Johnstown Savings Bank acquisition ($25.9 million) and the 1993
Integra Branches acquisition ($1.2 million).
Intangible assets are typically created when companies pay a
premium over book value to make acquisitions of businesses and
use the "purchase" method of accounting. There are two types of
intangibles. Identifiable intangibles are those that relate to
the fair market value of specific customer relationships.
Acquisitions of items such as core deposit liabilities and
mortgage servicing rights create this type of intangible. The
current value of future revenues attributable to such
relationships is used in order to establish the amount of
identifiable intangibles. A second category of intangibles is
goodwill. Goodwill represents the excess of the purchase price
(premium) over the fair market value of the assets (including
identifiable intangibles) and liabilities acquired.
USBANCORP believes these intangible assets represent real value
to the Company. For example, the total intangible assets created
with the JSB acquisition amounted to $20.2 million in goodwill
and $5.7 million in core deposit intangibles. The Company paid
this premium for JSB and believes its franchise value has been
strengthened by the acquisition for several reasons:
JSB's customer base, branch locations, and approximately $200
million of stable low cost core deposits allowed the Company to
obtain a 25% market share leadership position in Cambria County -
one of its primary markets.
the intra-market consolidation opportunities are expected to
provide for significant future ongoing earnings enhancements.
 Under accounting rules, intangibles are amortized over a period
of time and eventually disappear as an asset on the balance
sheet. The Company is amortizing core deposit intangibles over
periods ranging from five to ten years while goodwill is being
amortized over a 15 year life. The straight line method of
amortization is being used for both of these categories of
intangibles. It is important to note that this intangible
amortization expense is not a future cash flow item. The
following table reflects the future amortization expense of the
intangible assets:

<TABLE>

Total goodwill and core deposit
intangible assets at December 31, 1994       $27,009
</TABLE>

The value of these intangibles is reassessed regularly by the
Company. If it is determined that the value of any asset is
permanently impaired, appropriate adjustments to the book value
of that asset are made.

25. OFF-BALANCE SHEET HEDGE INSTRUMENTS
The Company enters into off-balance sheet hedging transactions to
help manage interest rate and market valuation risk exposure
which is incurred in normal recurrent banking activities. A
summary of the off-balance sheet hedging transactions completed
to date are as follows:

<PAGE>36

CMO Liability Hedge:
During the first quarter of 1994, the Company entered into an
interest rate swap agreement with a notional amount of $10
million and a termination date of February 11, 1997. Under the
terms of the swap agreement, the Company will receive a fixed
interest rate of 5% and pay a floating interest rate defined as
the 90 day Libor which resets quarterly. The counterparty in this
unsecured transaction is PNC Bank.
This swap agreement was initiated to hedge interest rate risk in
a declining, stable, or modestly rising rate environment.
Specifically, this transaction hedges the CMO liability on the
Company's Balance Sheet by effectively converting the fixed
percentage cost to a variable rate cost. This hedge also offsets
market valuation risk since any change in the market value of the
swap agreement correlates in the opposite direction with a change
in the market value of the CMO liability. Overall, this swap
agreement favorably reduced interest expense by $29,000 in 1994.
Leverage Program Hedge:
On September 28, 1994, the Company completed hedging transactions
with a notional amount of $100 million. The counterparty in these
unsecured transactions is Mellon Bank. The $100 million notional
amount was comprised of the following:
a $50 million interest rate swap agreement whereby the Company
pays a one year fixed interest rate of 6.08% and receives 90 day
Libor which resets quarterly. The termination date of this swap
agreement is September 28, 1995.
a $50 million interest rate cap on 90 day Libor whereby the cap
amounts to 5.25% for the period covering September 28, 1994,
through March 28, 1995, and then 5.75% for the period from March
29, 1995, through September 28, 1995. The cost of this cap was 63
basis points or $315,000 and is being amortized as an interest
expense over the life of the cap. At December 31, 1994, the
unamortized premium amounted to $236,000.
The Company purchased these derivative products to hedge an
interest rate mismatch that existed between the investment
securities portfolio and short-term Federal Home Loan Bank
borrowings. This mismatch was created upon consummation of the
balance sheet leverage program (see further discussion in M.D.&A.
on page 49) which increased the negativity of the Company's
static GAP ratios and the variability of the net interest income
under alternative rate scenarios. This hedge reduced interest
rate risk since after the hedge was put in place, the Company's
negative six-month static GAP was reduced by $100 million and
presently totals negative $96 million or 5.4% of total assets.
The interest rate swap portion of this hedge also offsets market
valuation risk since any change in the market value of the swap
agreement correlates in the opposite direction with any change in
the market value of the securities portfolio. These off-balance
sheet derivative hedge transactions increased interest expense by
approximately $200,000 in 1994.
The Company believes that its exposure to credit loss in the
event of non-performance by any of the counterparties is remote.
The Company monitors and controls all off-balance sheet
derivative products with a comprehensive Board of Director
approved hedging policy. In addition to interest rate swaps and
caps, the policy also allows for the use of interest rate floors.
The Company has not instituted the use of interest rate floors as
of December 31, 1994.

The ability of subsidiary banks to upstream cash to the Company
is restricted by regulations. Federal law prevents the Company
from borrowing from its subsidiary banks unless the loans are
secured by specified assets. Further, such secured loans are
limited in amount to ten percent of the subsidiary banks' capital
and surplus. In addition, the subsidiary banks are subject to
legal limitations on the amount of dividends that can be paid to
their shareholder. The dividend limitation generally restricts
dividend payments to a bank's retained net income for the current
and preceding two calendar years. Cash may also be upstreamed to
the Parent Company by the subsidiary banks as an inter-entity
management fee; these fees must be based upon the fair market
value of services provided by the Company. At December 31, 1994,
the subsidiary banks were 

<PAGE>38

permitted to upstream an additional $13,559,000 in cash dividends
and to loan on a secured basis $2,532,000 to the Company. The
subsidiary banks also had a combined $129,213,000 of restricted
surplus and retained earnings at December 31, 1994.
The Company also had available at December 31, 1994,$1.5 million
of a total $2.5 million line of credit from a non-affiliated
correspondent bank. This line of credit is unsecured and is
subject to annual review on September 30, 1995. Future drawdowns
on this line would be at short-term rates tied to 90 day Libor.
Additionally, there is an annual commitment fee of 1/4% on any
unused portion of the line.
Based on the risk-based capital guidelines of the Board of
Governors of the Federal Reserve System, a bank holding company
such as the Company, is required to maintain a Tier 1 capital to
risk-adjusted assets ratio of 4.00% and total capital to
risk-adjusted assets of 8.00%. At December 31, 1994, the Company
and each of its banking subsidiaries exceeded their respective
regulatory requirements.

STATEMENT OF MANAGEMENT RESPONSIBILITY

January 27, 1995

To the Stockholders and
Board of Directors of
USBANCORP, Inc.

Management of USBANCORP, Inc. and its subsidiaries have prepared
the consolidated financial statements and other information in
the "Annual Report and Form 10-K" in accordance with generally
accepted accounting principles and are responsible for its
accuracy.
In meeting its responsibility, management relies on internal
accounting and related control systems, which include selection
and training of qualified personnel, establishment and
communication of accounting and administrative policies and
procedures, appropriate segregation of responsibilities, and
programs of internal audit. These systems are designed to provide
reasonable assurance that financial records are reliable for
preparing financial statements and maintaining accountability for
assets and that assets are safeguarded against unauthorized use
or disposition. Such assurance cannot be absolute because of
inherent limitations in any internal control system.
Management also recognizes its responsibility to foster a climate
in which Company affairs are conducted with the highest ethical
standards. The Company's Code of Conduct, furnished to each
employee and director, addresses the importance of open internal
communications, potential conflicts of interest, compliance with
applicable laws, including those related to financial disclosure,
the confidentiality of proprietary information, and other items.
There is an ongoing program to assess compliance with these
policies.
The Audit Committee of the Company's Board of Directors consists
solely of outside directors. The Audit Committee meets
periodically with management and the independent accountants to
discuss audit, financial reporting, and related matters. Arthur
Andersen LLP and the Company's internal auditors have direct
access to the Audit Committee.

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT PUBLIC ACCOUNTANT

To the Stockholders and Board of Directors of USBANCORP, Inc.:
We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of
USBANCORP, Inc. (a Pennsylvania corporation) and subsidiaries as
of December 31, 1994 and 1993, and the related consolidated
statements of income, stockholders' equity and cash flows for
each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 1994.
Those financial statements are the responsibility of the
Company's management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion
on these financial statements based on our audits.
We conducted our audits in accordance with generally accepted
auditing standards. Those standards require that we plan and
perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether
the financial statements are free of material misstatement. An
audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting
the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. An audit
also includes assessing the accounting principles used and
significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating
the overall financial statement presentation. We believe that our
audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.
In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to
above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial
position of USBANCORP, Inc. and subsidiaries as of December 31,
1994 and 1993, and the results of their operations and their cash
flows for each of the three years in the period ended December
31, 1994, in conformity with generally accepted accounting
principles.
As discussed in Notes 1 and 13 to the Consolidated Financial
Statements, effective January 1, 1994, and 1993, the Company
changed its method of accounting for investments in debt and
equity securities and income taxes, respectively.

MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
CONDITION
AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS ("M. D. & A.")
The following discussion and analysis of financial condition and
results of operations of USBANCORP should be read in conjunction
with the consolidated financial statements of USBANCORP,
including the related notes thereto, included elsewhere herein.
RESULTS OF OPERATIONS FOR THE YEARS ENDED
DECEMBER 31, 1994, 1993, AND 1992
RECENT ACQUISITION HISTORY...The following represents a brief
summary of the acquisitions which impacted the Company's
financial performance over the three year period from January 1,
1992, through December 31, 1994. For a more comprehensive
discussion on each of these acquisitions, see Notes  to Financial
Statements 21, 22, and 23. 
Community Bancorp, Inc.: The acquisition of Community Bancorp,
Inc. was effective March 23, 1992, and, accordingly, impacted the
Company's financial performance for approximately nine months in
1992 and the full year in both 1993 and 1994. At the acquisition
date, Community Bancorp had total assets of $368 million, total
loans of $261 million, and total deposits of $321 million.
Community Bancorp added 12 community offices to the Company's
branch network in the suburban Pittsburgh marketplace. The total
cost of the Community Bancorp, Inc. acquisition was $21.7
million.
Integra Branches: On April 2, 1993, the Company's Three Rivers
Bank subsidiary acquired four branch offices located in the
suburban Pittsburgh marketplace from Integra National Bank. In
connection with the transaction, Three Rivers Bank assumed
approximately $89 million of deposit liabilities and purchased
$12 million of assets, approximately $10 million of which were
consumer loans. For the deposit liabilities assumed, Three Rivers
Bank paid Integra a deposit premium of 1.4% or $1.2 million. This
acquisition impacted the Company's financial performance for
approximately nine months in 1993 and the full year in 1994.
Johnstown Savings Bank: The acquisition of JSB for financial
reporting purposes was effective June 30, 1994, and, accordingly,
impacted the Company's financial performance for six months in
1994. At the acquisition date, JSB had total assets of $367
million, total loans of $125.6 million, and total deposits of
$209 million. JSB was immediately merged into the Company's U.S.
Bank subsidiary, which is also based in Johnstown, Pennsylvania,
giving U.S. Bank an approximate 25% deposit market share
leadership position in Cambria County. JSB also had a
wholly-owned mortgage banking subsidiary, Standard Mortgage
Company of Georgia, which U.S. Bank sold on an intracompany basis
immediately following the merger to Community Bancorp, Inc..
Standard Mortgage Company services approximately $1.2 billion of
mortgage loans and has purchased mortgage servicing rights
totalling $11.5 million.
The total cost of the JSB acquisition was $43.8 million. This
cost excludes a $1,882,000 after-tax acquisition restructuring
charge. JSB initially had six branch 

<PAGE>47

office locations in the Greater Johnstown marketplace. Late in
the third quarter of 1994, two of these offices were merged into
U.S. Bank's retail delivery system to achieve economy of scale
benefits.
PERFORMANCE OVERVIEW...The Company's net income for 1994 was
$11,320,000 or $2.18 on a fully diluted per share basis compared
to net income of $12,488,000 or $2.72 per fully diluted share for
1993 and net income of $8,883,000 or $2.53 per fully diluted
share for 1992. The Company's 1994 net income includes a
$1,882,000 after-tax acquisition restructuring charge related to
the June 30, 1994, completed intra-market purchase of Johnstown
Savings Bank. This previously disclosed acquisition charge
included expense recognition for one-time integration costs such
as employee severance, data processing conversion, and marketing
and communication costs. Excluding this acquisition charge, 1994
net income was $13,202,000 or $2.54 per fully diluted share. The
Company's 1993 net income included a $1,452,000 non-recurring
benefit due to the adoption of SFAS #109, "Accounting for Income
Taxes." Before the SFAS #109 benefit, 1993 net income was
$11,036,000 or $2.41 per fully diluted share. The Company's 1992
results were not impacted by any unusually large non-recurring or
extraordinary items.
When 1994 is compared with 1993, before the acquisition charge
and SFAS #109 benefit, the Company's net income increased by
$2,166,000 or 19.6% while fully diluted earnings per share
increased by a lesser amount of $0.13 or 5.4%. The Company's
return on average assets declined modestly by four basis points
to 0.87% while the return on average equity increased by 28 basis
points to 10.41%. The Company's improved net income was due to a
negative loan loss provision and increased net interest income
resulting from the JSB acquisition and the implementation of a
balance sheet leveraging program. These positive items were
partially offset by increased non-interest expense caused largely
by the JSB acquisition and lower non-interest income due to the
realization of approximately $4 million of losses on available
for sale investment security transactions. In conjunction with
the JSB acquisition, the Company also issued 957,857 new shares
of common stock which contributed to the 13.1% increase in
weighted average fully diluted shares outstanding to 5.192
million. The impact of these additional shares was the primary
reason that the fully diluted EPS growth rate was lower than the
net income growth rate experienced in 1994.
 When 1993 is compared with 1992, the Company's net income before
the SFAS #109 benefit increased by $2,153,000 or 24.2% while
fully diluted earnings per share decreased by $0.12 or 4.7%.
Similar trends were noted for two other key performance ratios as
the Company's return on assets before the SFAS #109 benefit
improved by six basis points to 0.91% while the return on equity
before the SFAS #109 benefit declined by 128 basis points to
10.13%. The increase in net income was attributed to the
Company's ability to enhance Community's net income and the
accretive impact of the purchase of four Integra branch offices.
Additionally, net income and return on assets increased due to
continued core growth in non-interest income, increased gains
realized on the sale of investment securities available for sale,
and the interest earnings generated on $24.6 million of net funds
provided from the Company's February 1993 secondary common stock
offering. This secondary common stock offering resulted in the
issuance of 1,150,000 new shares of the Company's common stock
causing a 30.5% increase in weighted average fully diluted shares
outstanding to approximately 4.59 million. The initial

temporary dilutive effect of these additional shares was the
major factor responsible for the $0.12 decline in fully diluted
earnings per share and the 128 basis point drop in return on
average equity experienced in 1993.

When 1994 is compared to 1993, USBANCORP's net interest income on
a tax-equivalent basis increased by $7,339,000 or 14.6% while the
net interest margin percentage declined by 31 basis points to
4.03%. The increased net interest income was due primarily to a
higher volume of earning assets resulting from the JSB
acquisition and a balance sheet leverage program. For 1994, total
average earning assets were $274 million higher than 1993. Net
interest income was also enhanced by approximately $500,000 of
non-accrual loan interest recoveries. While the leverage program
and the JSB acquisition did cause an increase in net interest
income, these same two factors also contributed to a compression
in the Company's net interest margin percentage which is fully
explained in the following discussion.
DYNAMIC LEVERAGE PROGRAM...In the second half of 1994, management
fully implemented a previously disclosed program designed to
better leverage the Company's balance sheet and equity. This
dynamic leverage program consists of the ongoing purchase and
replacement of an aggregate $122 million pool of "AAA" credit
quality investment securities. The pool is presently composed of
15 year fixed- and adjustable-rate mortgage-backed securities,
seven year balloons, U.S. Treasury securities and municipal
bonds. At December 31, 1994, approximately 39% of the pool is
adjustable-rate and 61% fixed-rate with a  

<PAGE>49

duration of approximately 3.6 years. This project is funded
through the Federal Home Loan Bank using one-year term funds tied
to 90 day Libor, 30 and 90 day wholesale reverse repurchase
agreements and overnight funds. The dynamic leverage pool will
remain in existence as long as the incremental spread between new
investments purchased into the pool and the latest funding cost,
net of hedging results, exceeds 150 basis points.
While this leverage program favorably increased net interest
income dollars by $1.2 million it did, however, contribute to a
lower net interest margin percentage since the average spread
earned on the funds deployed in the leverage program approximated
196 basis points compared to the Company's more typical net
interest spread of approximately 350 basis points. The following
table isolates the impact that the leverage program had on some
of the Company's key performance items in 1994:

</TABLE>

It is recognized that interest rate risk does exist, particularly
in the recently rising interest rate environment, from this
dynamic leverage program. To neutralize this risk, management
executed $150 million of hedging transactions late in the third
quarter which helped fix the variable funding costs associated
with this program through September 28, 1995 (see further
discussion under Note 25). While the initial cost of these hedge
transactions negatively impacted the Company's fourth quarter net
interest margin performance by approximately $400,000, they did
lock-in a minimum 150 basis point positive spread on the dynamic
leverage program through the hedge maturity dates.
JSB ACQUISITION...The Company's core net interest margin
performance was also negatively impacted by the JSB acquisition
and its lower net interest margin performance (i.e., During the
first half of 1994 prior to the acquisition, JSB's net interest
margin approximated 3.20% compared to the Company's 4.33% NIM
performance for that same period). This lower margin performance
at JSB can be attributed to its more typical savings bank balance
sheet mix; this mix includes a greater proportion of fixed-rate
residential and commercial mortgage loans and more reliance on
certificates of deposit, rather than non-interest bearing demand
deposits, as a funding source. The Company was able to improve
JSB's net interest margin performance by approximately 70 basis
points and its annual pre-tax net interest margin dollars by
approximately $2.9 million as a result of an investment portfolio
repositioning strategy executed in the months immediately
following the acquisition. The Company elected to sell $175
million or 90% of JSB's securities portfolio, which was comprised
primarily of collateralized mortgage obligations yielding
approximately 5.50%, and replace it with Federal Agency mortgage
pass through securities yielding approximately 7.2% with a
similar average life of approximately 3.5 years. The Company
prefers mortgage pass through securities because these
instruments have more predictable cash flows and less market
valuation risk than collateralized mortgage obligations. No gain
or loss was recognized on the sale of these securities for book
purposes since they had already been marked to market through
purchase accounting at the acquisition date.
 
<PAGE>50

When analyzing the Company's net interest margin percentage
performance on a quarterly basis during 1994, a declining
trendline was observed throughout the year as the net interest
margin declined from a high of 4.43% in the first quarter to a
low of 3.66% in the fourth quarter. The most significant
quarterly NIM drop of 34 basis points occurred between the third
and fourth quarters. As previously mentioned, the JSB acquisition
and leverage program were primary elements contributing to the
margin decline in the second half of the year. Other factors
responsible for the fourth quarter decline were:
the $200,000 initial cost associated with instituting the $100
million off-balance sheet hedge program.
the $200,000 cost associated with extending $50 million of
overnight borrowings with the FHLB into a one year fixed-rate
advance which matures on September 28, 1995.
a liability funding mix shift as deposit balances in low cost
savings accounts declined by approximately $35 million in the
fourth quarter of 1994. Specifically, $11 million of these
deposits shifted into higher, fixed-rate certificates of deposit
with maturities exceeding one year at an increased cost to the
Company of approximately 400 basis points. The remaining $24
million of these deposits were replaced with borrowed FHLB funds
at a similarly higher rate. This unfavorable funding mix shift
reduced net interest income by approximately $400,000, but does
provide the Company with certain additional margin protection
from any near-term rate increases.
One factor contributing to the deposit mix shift was the
implementation of a Customer's Choice certificate of deposit
program in the fourth quarter of 1994. This program was executed
in an effort to both slow deposit run-off and further grow the
deposit base with funds at incremental costs currently lower than
comparable Federal Home Loan Bank funding alternatives.
Additionally, this program provided the Company's community
office employees with a viable product to sell during a period in
which pricing was not increased on lower cost core accounts. The
program was successful during the six week period it was in place
as it generated $38 million of total deposits of which $13
million or 34% represented new funds from outside the
organization. The average fixed cost of these deposits was 6.22%
with an average term of approximately 18 months. This extension
of the liability base also allowed the Company to reduce the
negativity of its six month and one year static GAP positions.
For the first quarter of 1995, the Company generally expects the
net interest margin to modestly improve from the 3.66% recent
quarterly performance. This general expectation is based upon the
following:
late in the fourth quarter of 1994, the Company repositioned its
investment portfolio by selling $81 million of available for sale
securities with a weighted average coupon of approximately 6.02%
and remaining maturity of 29 months. Securities in the amount of
$77 million were purchased with a weighted average coupon of
approximately 8.80% and a maturity of 49 months. The approximate
275 basis point yield improvement on this repositioning strategy
will generate $2.1 million of additional pre-tax earnings for
each of the next three years. The yield improvement for the
remaining 13 months may differ due to the variable rate
composition of the securities.
the $100 million of off-balance sheet hedge transaction
associated with the leverage program will provide a locked-in
first quarter net margin benefit of $266,000.

These expected net interest margin enhancements may, however, be
negated by additional funding cost increases given the February
1, 1995, Federal Reserve 

<PAGE>51

action to increase interest rates by 50 basis points, the
possible continued customer deposit mix shift from lower cost
core accounts into higher fixed cost certificates of deposit, and
the potential implementation by the Company of additional hedges
during the first quarter.
When 1993 is compared to 1992, USBANCORP's tax equivalent net
interest income increased by $5.0 million or 11.0% while the net
interest margin percentage declined by 24 basis points to 4.34%.
The increased net interest income was due primarily to a higher
volume of earning assets resulting from the Integra Branches and
Community Savings Bank acquisitions and the $24.6 million in net
funds provided from the secondary common stock offering. For
1993, total average earning assets were $167 million higher than
1992. The contraction in the net interest margin can best be
explained by the following factors:
The full year impact of the Community Savings acquisition and its
lower NIM performance which averaged in the 3.80% to 4.00% range
during 1993. This margin performance was lower than the net
interest margin operating performance of approximately 4.60%
experienced at the Company's other banking subsidiaries. This
lower margin performance at Community can be attributed to its
more typical savings bank balance sheet mix; this mix includes a
greater portion of one- to four-family fixed-rate residential
mortgage loans and more reliance on certificates of deposit,
rather than non-interest bearing demand deposit accounts, as a
funding source. It is the Company's intent to gradually improve
Community's margin to a higher operating level by diversifying
the loan mix to include more rate sensitive and shorter maturity
commercial and consumer loans. This diversification of the loan
portfolio has already begun as commercial loans comprised 15% of
Community's total loan portfolio at December 31, 1993 (at
December 31, 1994, it was 21%), compared to only 4% at March 31,
1992. A decline in the dependence on real estate loans was
experienced as Community's real estate loan portfolio composition
percentage decreased from 82% to 74% between these same two
dates. This decline resulted from the sale of primarily all new
30 year fixed-rate residential mortgage loans originated during
1993 totalling approximately $22 million at a gain of $593,000.
Since only $10 million of loans were acquired with the Integra
Branch offices, the majority of the $88 million of acquired
Integra deposits were redeployed into investment securities.
Additionally, $24.6 million of funds provided from the secondary
market common stock issuance were also invested in the securities
portfolio. This initial dependence on the investment portfolio as
the primary source of return on these acquired deposits and stock
issuance proceeds was a major factor contributing to the
contraction in the net interest margin percentage.
The table that follows provides an analysis of net interest
income on a tax-equivalent basis setting forth (i) average
assets, liabilities and stockholders' equity, (ii) interest
income earned on interest earning assets and interest expense
paid on interest bearing liabilities, (iii) average yields earned
on interest earning assets and average rates paid on interest
bearing liabilities, (iv) USBANCORP's interest rate spread (the
difference between the average yield earned on interest earning
assets and the average rate paid on interest bearing
liabilities), and (v) USBANCORP's net interest margin (net
interest income as a percentage of average total interest earning
assets). For purposes of this table, loan balances include
non-accrual loans and interest income on loans includes loan fees
or amortization of such fees which have been deferred as well as
interest recorded on non-accrual loans as cash is received once
the principal has been fully paid.

volume and rate components of interest income and interest
expense. The table below sets forth an analysis of volume and
rate changes in net interest income on a tax-equivalent basis.
For purposes of this table, changes inbased upon the respective 
percentage changes in average balances
and average rates. Changes in net interest income that could not
be specifically identified as either a rate or volume change were
allocated proportionately to changes in volume and changes in
rate.

</TABLE>

Regarding the separate components of net interest income, the
Company's total tax equivalent interest income for 1994 increased
by $18.1 million or 20.9% when compared to 1993. This increase
was due to the previously mentioned $274 million increase in
average earning assets which caused interest income to rise by
$18.6 million between years. This positive factor was partially
offset by an unfavorable rate variance of $473,000 as a reduced
loan portfolio yield more than offset an improved yield for the
total investment security portfolio causing the Company's total
earning asset yield to drop by 17 basis points to 7.31%. The full
year impact was felt in 1994 of the trend of accelerated customer
refinancing of mortgage loans during the latter part of 1993.
This trend combined with limited new consumer loan growth caused
the Company's total loan portfolio yield to drop 32 basis points
to 8.29%. This drop more than offset the benefit of a 33 basis
point increase in the total investment security portfolio yield
to 6.03%. This improved security yield reflected only the partial
year benefit of the following strategic initiatives executed
during 1994 in an attempt to generate increased earnings from the
securities portfolio by taking additional managed and controlled
interest rate risk:
the securities purchased in conjunction with the $122 million
dynamic leverage program.

<PAGE>54


the sale and repositioning of $175 million or 90% of JSB's
investment security portfolio.
the sale late in the fourth quarter of 1994 of $81 million of
available for sale securities with a weighted average coupon
(WAC) of 6.02% and weighted average maturity (WAM) of 29 months
generated a $4 million loss. The proceeds from this sale were
used to purchase $77 million of securities with a WAC of 8.80%
and a WAM of 49 months.
At December 31, 1994, as a result of these strategic initiatives
the balance in the investment securities portfolio totalled $784
million with a WAC of 6.84% and WAM of 3.8 years compared to a
total securities balance of $429 million at December 31, 1993,
with a WAC of 5.45% and a WAM of 2.8 years. The Company is now
positioned to garner the full year benefits of these strategies
in 1995.
The Company's total interest income for 1993 increased by $2.9
million or 3.6% when compared to 1992. This increase was due
entirely to the previously mentioned $167 million increase in
average earning assets which resulted in a $7.5 million increase
in interest income between years. This positive factor was offset
by an unfavorable rate variance of $4.6 million as the Company's
earning assets repriced downward in conjunction with the national
decline in interest rates. Specifically, the yield on the loan
portfolio decreased 80 basis points to 8.61% while the yield on
total investment securities and investment securities available
for sale dropped 124 basis points to 5.70%. The national and
local market trend of accelerated customer refinancing of
mortgage loans contributed materially to the declining yields
experienced in both of these portfolios. Finally, the increased
dependence on investment securities as a funding use negatively
impacted the earning asset mix in 1993.
The Company's total interest expense for 1994 increased by $10.7
million or 29.6% when compared to 1993. This increase was also
caused by a $260 million increase in average interest bearing
liabilities resulting from the previously mentioned JSB
acquisition and FHLB borrowings used to fund the leverage
program. These increased FHLB borrowings also negatively impacted
the liability mix and overall cost of funds because the cost of
these borrowings averaged 5.12% for 1994 compared to the
Company's core cost of deposits of 3.47%. This 3.47% cost of core
deposits represented a 14 basis point decline from the prior year
and was the primary factor responsible for the $888,000 favorable
variance in 1994.
This decline in deposit costs is primarily a result of management
repricing all deposit categories downward in the declining
interest rate environment experienced during 1993 and generally
maintaining those low rates for non-certificate of deposit
products during the rising rate environment experienced in 1994
(see further discussion under Interest Rate Sensitivity on page
65 regarding future limitations on the Company's ability to
continue to maintain these low core deposit rates). It has been
management's ongoing pricing strategy to position USBANCORP's
core savings deposit rates within the lower quartile of deposit
rates offered by commercial banks in its market area. Management
believes that a constant level of high service quality mitigates
the impact this rate positioning strategy has on the deposit base
size and funds availability provided that the rates offered are
not appreciably below competition.
During the second half of 1994, the Company positioned its
certificate of deposit pricing within the upper half of deposit
rates offered by commercial banks in its market area. This
increase in certificate of deposit pricing was done for several
reasons: to help retain customers immediately after the JSB
acquisition during a critical period which included a computer
system conversion, to try to encourage customer deposit term
extension in a rising interest rate environment, and to use 

<PAGE>55

 lower cost deposits as a source of funds to replace higher cost
and more rate sensitive FHLB borrowings which were being used to
fund a portion of JSB's acquired balance sheet. As a result of
the rising interest rate environment and the increased
certificate of deposit pricing, the Company did begin to
experience a shift of funds out of low cost savings accounts and
into certificates of deposit during the fourth quarter of 1994.
Specifically, approximately $11 million of funds shifted into
fixed cost certificates of deposit with maturities generally
exceeding one year with an increased cost to the Company of
approximately 400 basis points. The combination of all these
price and liability composition movements caused USBANCORP's
average cost of interest bearing liabilities to increase by eight
basis points from 3.76% during 1993 to 3.84% during 1994.
The Company's total interest expense for 1993 decreased by $l $7.1 million 
of interest expense generated
from a $115 million increase in average interest bearing
liabilities. This negative factor was more than offset by a $9.2
million favorable variance which resulted primarily from
management repricing all deposit categories downward in a
declining interest rate environment. The magnitude of the
downward repricing was more pronounced at Community as their
deposit rate structure was reduced to levels more consistent with
bank competition and the Company's other banking subsidiaries.
Regarding the deposit mix, the Company experienced a shift of
funds from short-term certificates of deposit into more liquid
interest bearing demand and savings accounts due to the narrowing
of the rate spread between these products and customer preference
for liquidity in the low interest rate environment. The Company
also used an additional $17.6 million (average balance) of
advances from the Federal Home Loan Bank to extend the liability
maturity base at Community in order to better manage interest
rate risk. These price and liability composition movements
allowed USBANCORP to lower the average cost of interest bearing
liabilities by 76 basis points from 4.52% in 1992 to 3.76% in
1993.
LOAN QUALITY...USBANCORP's written lending policies require
underwriting, loan documentation, and credit analysis standards
to be met prior to funding any loan. After the loan has been
approved and funded, continued periodic credit review is
required. Annual credit reviews are mandatory for all commercial
loans in excess of $100,000 and for all commercial mortgages in
excess of $250,000. In addition, due to the secured nature of
residential mortgages and the smaller balances of individual
installment loans, sampling techniques are used on a continuing
basis for credit reviews in these loan areas.
The following table sets forth information concerning USBANCORP's
loan delinquency and other non-performing assets:

except for loans that are insured for credit loss, are placed on
non-accrual status immediately upon becoming 90 days past due in
either principal or interest.
</TABLE>

<PAGE>56

At December 31, 1994, non-accrual loans as a percentage of total
loans and loans held for sale, net of unearned income, were
0.63%. Total non-performing assets as a percentage of total loans
and loans held for sale, net of unearned income, and other real
estate owned were 0.91% at this same year-end 1994 date. The
decreases from December 31, 1992, in each of these categories
were due primarily to the Company's ongoing loan work-out program
which has been implemented at each banking subsidiary. Overall,
total loan delinquency (past due 30 to 89 days) as a percentage
of total loans, net of unearned income, totalled 1.48% at
December 31, 1994, and increased modestly between years.
Potential problem loans consist of loans which are included in
performing loans, but for which potential credit problems of the
borrowers have caused management to have concerns as to the
ability of such borrowers to comply with present repayment terms.
At December 31, 1994, all identified potential problem loans were
included in the preceding table.
ALLOWANCE AND PROVISION FOR LOAN LOSSES...As a financial
institution which assumes lending and credit risks as a principal
element of its business, the Company anticipates that credit
losses will be experienced in the normal course of business.
Accordingly, management of the Company makes a quarterly
determination as to an appropriate provision from earnings
necessary to maintain an allowance for loan losses that is
adequate for potential yet undetermined losses. The amount
charged against earnings is based upon several factors including,
at a minimum, each of the following:
a continuing review of delinquent, classified and non-accrual
loans, large loans, and overall portfolio quality. This
continuous review assesses the risk characteristics of both
individual loans and the total loan portfolio.
regular examinations and review of the loan portfolio by
representatives of the regulatory authorities.
analytical review of loan charge-off experience, delinquency
rates, and other relevant historical and peer statistical ratios.
management's judgment with respect to local and general economic
conditions and their impact on the existing loan portfolio.
When it is determined that the prospects for recovery of the
principal of a loan have significantly diminished, the loan is
immediately charged against the allowance account; subsequent
recoveries, if any, are credited to the allowance account. In
addition, non-accrual and large delinquent loans are reviewed
monthly to determine potential losses. Consumer loans are
considered losses when they are 90 days past due, except loans
that are insured for credit loss.
USBANCORP has no credit exposure to foreign countries, foreign
borrowers, or highly leveraged transactions.

</TABLE>

The Company recorded a negative provision for loan losses of $2.8
million in 1994 compared to loan loss provisions of $2.4 million
in 1993 and $2.2 million in 1992. When expressed as a percentage
of average loans, the provision averaged (.34%) in 1994, .34% in
1993, and .36% in 1992. When 1994 is compared to 1993, this
represents a net favorable shift of $5.2 million.
The overall negative provision for 1994 resulted from a one-time
non-recurring negative provision of $4 million recognized in the
fourth quarter. This negative provision was driven by the
continuing improvement of the Company's asset quality including
reduced levels of net loan charge-offs. Specifically, since 1987,
USBANCORP, Inc. has meticulously adhered to a publicly disclosed
procedural discipline in determining both the necessary provision
for loan losses to be taken from earnings and the adequacy of the
allowance for loan losses. Based upon management's judgment and
evaluation of this systematic procedural methodology, the Company
has reduced its quarterly provision for loan losses three times
since the beginning of 1993. Despite these expense reductions,
and due to both nominal loan charge-offs and ongoing work-out
successes and recoveries, the provision for loan losses has
exceeded net charge-offs each quarter since June 30, 1992.
Indeed, for the full year 1994 net charge-offs again dropped to
$327,000 or only .04% of total loans. In recognition of this well
established trend, the Company's increasingly diversified loan
mix and geographic presence, stabilized and improving regional
economies, completed credit integration of all recent
acquisitions and the continuing 

<PAGE>58

adequacy of the allowance for loan losses subsequent to the
non-recurring negative provision, it was management's and the
Board of Director's judgment that the interests of the Company's
shareholders and customers were best served by this immediate,
one-time negative provision.
Subsequent to the non-recurring negative provision, management
believes the Company's allowance is adequate at each subsidiary
bank for losses inherent in the portfolio and its allowance
coverage is generally comparable with peer institutions. The
allowance for loan losses at December 31, 1994, was 1.80% of
total loans and 197% of non-performing assets; according to the
most recent bank analysis prepared by SNL Securities, the peer
average for banks throughout the country between $1 and $5
billion in assets is an allowance to non-performing assets ratio
of 128%. Consistent with the Company's historic practice of
maintaining a surplus in the allowance for loan losses of at
least 20% of the systematically determined minimum requirement,
the unallocated general reserve amount was $6.6 million or 74% of
the total required need at December 31, 1994. There can be no
assurance that if asset quality deteriorates in future periods
material additions to the allowance for loan losses will not be
required; management currently estimates, however, that the 1995
provision for loan losses will approximate $500,000.
When December 31, 1993, is compared to December 31, 1992, the
allowance coverage ratios for non-accrual loans and
non-performing assets increased due to the previously discussed
improvement in the Company's asset quality combined with an
increased balance in the allowance for loan losses. The December
31, 1993, allowance to total loans and loans held for sale, net
of unearned income, ratio of 2.10% declined by only two basis
points from the December 31, 1992, level of 2.12% despite the
$78.3 million of growth experienced in the loan portfolio.
USBANCORP management is unable to determine in what loan category
future charge-offs and recoveries may occur. The following
schedule sets forth the allocation of the allowance for loan
losses among various categories. This allocation is based upon
historical experience. The entire allowance for loan losses is
available to absorb future loan losses in any loan category.

NON-INTEREST INCOME...Non-interest income for 1994 totalled $8.2
million which represented a $2 million or 19.3% decrease when
compared to 1993. This decrease was primarily due to the
following items:
the realization of a $4 million loss on investment securities
available for sale in 1994 compared to a $583,000 gain realized
in 1993 (a net unfavorable shift of $4.6 million). The 1994 loss
resulted primarily from an investment portfolio

<PAGE>59

repositioning strategy executed late in the fourth quarter which
was designed to enhance future net interest income performance.
Specifically, $81 million of available for sale securities with a
weighted average coupon of 6.02% and weighted average maturity of
29 months were sold at a $4 million loss. The proceeds from this
sale were used to purchase $77 million of securities with a WAC
of 8.80% and a WAM of 49 months. The approximate 275 basis point
yield improvement on this repositioning strategy will generate
$2.1 million of additional pre-tax earnings for each of the next
three years. The yield improvement for the remaining 13 months
may differ due to the variable rate composition of the
securities. Other investment security strategies executed in 1994
included the second quarter sale of certain collateralized
mortgage obligations in an effort to reduce the market valuation
risk of the available for sale portfolio, enhance yield
performance and reduce cash flow volatility. The losses from this
repositioning strategy were almost offset by gains generated from
a sales strategy executed in the first quarter to capture
available market premiums on securities with a remaining maturity
of generally less than one year.
the inclusion of $1.1 million of net mortgage servicing income
generated from a mortgage banking subsidiary acquired with the
JSB acquisition. This amount resulted from $1.9 million of
mortgage servicing fees net of $746,000 of amortization expense
of the cost of purchased mortgage servicing rights. As of
December 31, 1994, this mortgage banking subsidiary was servicing
$1.2 billion of mortgage loans. SMC's servicing portfolio has
benefited from recent increases in interest rates as the value of
the servicing portfolio typically increases in a rising interest
rate environment due to slower mortgage prepayment speeds. Recent
valuations of the portfolio caused SMC to reduce the monthly
amortization expense of the purchased mortgage servicing rights
(PMSRs) by approximately $50,000 in the fourth quarter due to
extension of the servicing lives. This reduction will favorably
impact the 1995 pre-tax performance of SMC by approximately
$500,000. The following chart highlights some of the key
information related to SMC's mortgage servicing portfolio:

a $445,000 or 17.3% increase in trust fees to $3 million in 1994.
This core trust fee growth is prompted by the profitable
expansion of the Company's business throughout western
Pennsylvania including the Greater Pittsburgh marketplace. Total
trust assets (discretionary and non-discretionary) have grown by
$85 million or 9% since December 31, 1993, and now total over $1
billion at December 31, 1994. The Trust staff's marketing skills
combined with their proven ability to deliver quality service has
been the key to the Company's growth rate, which has ranged
between 17%-25% annually for each of the past four years. While
there can be no assurances of continuation of this trend, these
factors provide a foundation for future growth of this important
source of fee income.
the realization of a $763,000 gain on loan and servicing sales in
1994 compared to a $593,000 gain for 1993. The $170,000 increase
between periods was due entirely to a $200,000 gain recognized on
the sale of the Company's $17 million student loan portfolio
which more than offset reduced gains generated on $60 million of
fixed-rate mortgage loan sales in 1994.
an $883,000 increase in other income due primarily to additional
fee income resulting from the JSB acquisition. Examples of fee
income sources demonstrating increases are: credit card charges,
other mortgage banking processing fees, ATM transaction charges,
and bond handling fees. Other income was also supplemented by an
$88,000 gain realized on the liquidation of a real estate joint
venture and a $70,000 increase in premium income on credit life
and disability insurance sales to consumer loan customers.
Non-interest income for 1993 totalled $10.2 million which
represented a $1.8 million or 21.6% increase over 1992. This
increase was primarily due to an $855,000 increase in service
charges on deposit accounts, a $524,000 increase in trust fees, a
$190,000 increase in realized gains on the sale of investment
securities classified as "available for sale," and a $92,000
increase in wholesale cash processing fees. These positive
factors were partially offset by a $144,000 decrease in gains
realized on the sale of loans classified as "held for sale."
The $855,000 or 44.6% increase in deposit service charges
resulted partly from higher deposit levels due to the
acquisitions. Additionally, the other significant part of this
increase was due to the benefits of a revised deposit service
charge pricing strategy implemented at Community on March 1,
1993. The $524,000 or 25.5% increase in trust fees resulted
primarily from continued successful business development efforts
as total trust assets (discretionary and non-discretionary) grew
by 45.1% since December 31, 1992, to $943 million at December 31,
1993. Specifically, corporate trust assets grew by $98 million or
44%, employee benefit assets grew by $60 million or 26%, and
personal trust assets grew by $75 million or 29%. A portion of
the growth in personal trust assets was fueled by the continued
successful sales of the Pathroad Account, a competitively priced
mutual fund product. The increase in realized gains on the sale
of investment securities available for sale resulted from the
execution of several investment strategies to capture available
market premiums on various mortgage-backed securities which had
the characteristics of low remaining balances and fast prepayment
histories. Also, the $92,000 increase in wholesale cash
processing fees resulted from continued growth in the customer
base. Even though it was a $144,000 reduction from 1992, the
Company realized $593,000 in gains from the sale of approximately
$22 million of 30 year fixed-rate residential mortgage loans
which were originated during 1993.

NON-INTEREST EXPENSE...Total 1994 non-interest expense of $49.5
million increased by $8.8 million or 21.6% when compared to 1993
due in part to the recognition of a $2.4 million pre-tax
acquisition restructuring charge associated with the Company's
acquisition of Johnstown Savings Bank. Excluding this charge,
total non-interest expense increased by $6.4 million or 15.6%
when 1994 is compared to 1993. The acquisition of JSB has been
the primary reason for the increase experienced in each of the
expense line items and is evidenced by the following more
significant changes:
a $3,359,000 or 16.8% increase in salaries and employee benefits
expense due entirely to planned wage increases approximating 4%,
69 additional average full-time equivalent employees resulting
from the JSB and Integra Branches acquisitions and a $343,000
increase in pension/profit sharing expense.
a $1,221,000 increase in net occupancy and equipment expense as a
result of the additional branch facilities and equipment acquired
with the JSB and Integra branches acquisitions and higher
utilities and repair/maintenance expenses due in part to the
harsh winter early in 1994.
a $974,000 increase in amortization expense due entirely to the
amortization of the goodwill and core deposit intangibles
resulting from the JSB and Integra branches acquisition (see
further discussion in Note 24).
a $419,000 increase in FDIC deposit insurance expense caused by
the additional deposits associated with the acquisitions.
a $214,000 decrease in other expense due to reduced other real
estate owned expense and economy of scale benefits derived from
the elimination of outside data processing fees, as Community's
data processing is now performed internally at the centralized
Western Region Operations Center.
When 1993 is compared to 1992, total non-interest expense of
$40.7 million increased by $4.5 million or 12.3%. This increase
was primarily caused by the following items:
a $1,914,000 or 10.6% increase in salaries and employee benefits
due to planned wage increases approximating 4%, an additional 30
(average) full-time employees due to the previously mentioned
Integra branches and CSB acquisitions and increased group
hospitalization expense.
a $1.4 million increase in other expense due in part to a
$287,000 loss on the disposition of real estate owned property,
approximately $300,000 of non-recurring expenses incurred for a
computer conversion at Community from an outside data processing
contractor to an in-house computer processing system at Three
Rivers Bank, and the charge-off of $73,000 of remaining debt
issuance costs due to the early retirement of the mortgage bonds
used to finance U.S. Bank's Main Office headquarters facility.
a $464,000 or 15.8% increase in net occupancy expense due to the
additional branch facilities acquired with the Integra and CSB
acquisitions and higher maintenance and repair costs.

<PAGE>62


NET OVERHEAD BURDEN...Excluding the JSB acquisition charge and
$3.8 million of net security losses from the fourth quarter
investment portfolio repositioning strategy, the Company's net
overhead to average assets ratio averaged 2.32% in 1994. This
represents the third consecutive year that this ratio has
declined from a high of 3.01% in 1991. The Company's net overhead
to tax equivalent net interest income ratio has remained
relatively stable at approximately 61% over the past three years
after dropping from a high of 69% in 1991. Employee productivity
ratios continue to demonstrate improvement as total assets per
employee were $2.3 million at the end of 1994, a 22.8%
improvement over the 1993 year-end total of $1.9 million assets
per employee, and a 29.5% increase over the 1992 amount of $1.8
million. The improvement in these net overhead measures
demonstrates management's commitment to effectively integrating
acquisitions to achieve productivity enhancements, operational
efficiencies and economy of scale benefits. The Company continues
to target a 55% net overhead expense to tax-equivalent net
interest income ratio goal.
JSB INTEGRATION BENEFITS...During the second half of 1994, the
Company began the process of integrating JSB into its U.S. Bank
subsidiary in order to begin realizing as soon as possible the
previously disclosed $3.8 million of annual pre-tax savings
opportunities expected from this intra-market consolidation.
Specific cost savings/revenue generating actions completed during
the third and fourth quarters of 1994 included: a computer
conversion from JSB's outside data processing service bureau to
U.S. Bank's internal data processing system, the consolidation of
two JSB branches into the Company's existing retail delivery
system, the consolidation of back room check clearing and item
processing operations, the consolidation of several
administrative functions such as executive administration,
accounting and internal audit, the transfer of all subsidiary
banks' mortgage servicing to the newly acquired Standard Mortgage
Corporation, an investment portfolio repositioning strategy that
resulted in the sale of approximately 90% of JSB's securities
portfolio (see complete discussion under JSB acquisition on page
50), and the downward repricing of several deposit products. The
favorable pre-tax benefits recognized during the second half of
1994 due to these initiatives amounted to approximately $1.4
million. Since the majority of these initiatives were not
completed until late in the third quarter and early in the fourth
quarter, the Company expects, based upon the strategies in place
at year-end 1994, to realize annual pre-tax benefits of
approximately $5 million beginning in 1995. The improved total
pre-tax benefits from the integration reflect better than
expected net interest margin enhancements at JSB, as the Company
fully expects to garner each dollar of its initial estimated
annual cost savings. Overall, the Company has retained
approximately 60 employees or just 50% of the original JSB total
(excluding Standard Mortgage Corporation) of 120 full-time
equivalent employees.
INCOME TAX EXPENSE...The Company's provision for income taxes for
1994 was $5.9 million reflecting an effective tax rate of 34.4%.
The Company's 1993 income tax provision was $5.5 million or an
effective tax rate of 33.2%. The JSB acquisition was responsible
for the modest increase in the Company's effective tax rate due
to nondeductible expenses for goodwill and other acquisition
costs. 

<PAGE>63

The Company's effective tax rate, however, did benefit by
approximately 5% over that same time period due to increased
tax-free asset holdings. The tax-free asset holdings consist of
municipal investment securities with a duration of approximately
four years and commercial loan tax anticipation notes which
generally have a maturity of one year. For 1994, total tax-free
asset holdings were $65 million higher on average than 1993 and
amounted to $124 million.
Effective January 1, 1993, the Company adopted Statement of
Financial Accounting Standards #109, "Accounting For Income
Taxes." This adoption resulted in the recording of a deferred tax
asset of $1,452,000 and a corresponding credit to the income
statement as a cumulative effect of change in accounting
principle. Excluding this non-recurring benefit, the Company's
provision for income taxes for 1993 was $5.5 million reflecting
an effective tax rate of 33.2%. This represented a tax expense
increase of $44,000 over 1992 due solely to the higher pre-tax
income since the effective tax rate between years declined as a
result of increased tax-free asset holdings.
 SIGNIFICANT UNCOMMON PRE-TAX INCOME AND EXPENSE...As mentioned
throughout this M.D.& A., the Company recognized in 1994 the net
unfavorable effect of several uncommon items aggregating
approximately $2.2 million pre-tax. The largest pre-tax items
were the $2.4 million JSB acquisition charge, the $4 million
negative loan loss provision, $4 million of investment security
losses resulting from the repositioning strategy and a $200,000
gain on the sale of the student loan portfolio.
In 1993, USBANCORP recognized the net unfavorable pre-tax effect
of several uncommon items aggregating approximately $367,000. The
largest items were $350,000 of expenses related to the Community
data processing and Integra branch conversions, a $287,000 loss
on real estate owned property, a $73,000 write-off of bond
issuance costs, and $343,000 of realized gains from fixed-rate
mortgage loan sales. In 1992, USBANCORP recognized the net
favorable pre-tax effect of several items aggregating
approximately $138,000.
BALANCE SHEET...The Company's total consolidated assets were
$1.789 billion at December 31, 1994, compared with $1.242 billion
at December 31, 1993, which represents an increase of $547
million or 44.1%. The June 30, 1994, acquisition of Johnstown
Savings Bank accounted for $367 million or 67.1% of the growth
between periods. The cost of the JSB acquisition was $43.8
million. In conjunction with the acquisition, 957,857 new shares
of UBAN common stock were issued at a per share price of $25.125
which caused a $24.1 million increase in total equity. Since the
acquisition has been accounted for under the purchase method of
accounting, the December 31, 1994, balances for the newly created
core deposit intangibles and goodwill totalled $5.4 million and
$19.6 million, respectively.
Excluding JSB, the previously discussed $122 million dynamic
leverage program explained the majority of the remaining growth
in assets. This program was designed to enhance the Company's
return on equity by leveraging the investment securities
portfolio through the use of funding sources available from the
Federal Home Loan Bank. Specifically, total securities have
increased by $165.3 million while federal funds purchased, other
short term borrowings, and FHLB advances have grown by a total of
$248 million. The growth in borrowings exceeded the securities
portfolio growth because borrowings were also needed to maintain
the funding of the loan portfolio since total deposits declined
by $43 million or 4.1% since December 31, 1993. The decline in
deposits can be attributed to management's application of the
previously discussed pricing philosophy which emphasizes 

<PAGE>64

profitable net interest margin management rather than increased
deposit size. This deposit pricing strategy was maintained during
a period of aggressively increasing competitive deposit rates
particularly in the Greater Pittsburgh suburban area. Regarding
the JSB acquisition, the Company used quality customer service to
achieve its goal of retaining over 90% of the total deposits
acquired in this intra-market consolidation.
Excluding the $125.6 million of loans acquired with the JSB
acquisition and the $17 million of student loans sold, total
loans and loans held for sale also increased by $32.2 million or
4.4% since year-end 1993. This growth occurred primarily in the
second and third quarters of 1994 and reflects the economic
stability and diversification of both regions of the Company's
marketplace - Greater Johnstown and suburban Pittsburgh. The
majority of the loan growth occurred in the commercial loan
portfolio which grew by $11.5 million or 11.6%. The Company
experienced increased demand for both taxable and tax-free
commercial loans in 1994. Total real estate loans (including home
equity products) also grew modestly by 3.7% during 1994 despite
the Company's practice of selling all newly originated 30 year
fixed-rate mortgage loans amounting to approximately $60 million
in 1994. This commercial and mortgage loan growth more than
offset reduced consumer loan balances caused largely by the sale
of the Company's $17 million student loan portfolio late in the
second quarter of 1994. Management elected to divest of this line
of business since future profitability will be adversely impacted
by scheduled changes in regulations and servicing requirements.
Consumer loan balances have also been negatively impacted by
intense competitive pressures in the indirect auto loan business
segment. Several finance companies and credit unions have been
offering below market auto loan rates in an effort to develop
business during a 1994 period of strong consumer demand for
automobile purchases. The Company, while maintaining a commitment
to profitably price this product in this competitive environment,
has consequently struggled to maintain both indirect and direct
auto loan balances.
INTEREST RATE SENSITIVITY...Asset/liability management involves
managing the risks associated with changing interest rates and
the resulting impact on the Company's net interest income and
capital. The management and measurement of interest rate risk at
USBANCORP is performed by using the following tools: 1) static
"GAP" analysis which analyzes the extent to which interest rate
sensitive assets and interest rate sensitive liabilities are
matched at specific points in time; 2) simulation modeling which
analyzes the impact of interest rate changes on net interest
income and capital levels over specific future time periods by
projecting the yield performance of assets and liabilities in
numerous varied interest rate environments.
For static GAP analysis, USBANCORP typically defines interest
rate sensitive assets and liabilities as those that reprice
within six months or one year. Maintaining an appropriate match
is one method of avoiding wide fluctuations in net interest
margin during periods of changing interest rates. The difference
between rate sensitive assets and rate sensitive liabilities is
known as the "interest sensitivity GAP." A positive GAP occurs
when rate sensitive assets exceed rate sensitive liabilities
repricing in the same time period and a negative GAP occurs when
rate sensitive liabilities exceed rate sensitive assets repricing
in the same time period. A GAP ratio (rate sensitive assets
divided by rate sensitive liabilities) of one indicates a
statistically perfect match. A GAP ratio of less than one
suggests that a financial institution may be better positioned to
take advantage of declining interest rates rather than increasing
interest rates, and a GAP ratio of more than one suggests the
converse.

</TABLE>

The acquisition of JSB and the implementation of the investment
securities leverage program caused a shift to more negative
static GAP ratios at December 31, 1994. As previously discussed
in detail in Note 25, the Company has executed a total of $110
million of off-balance sheet hedge transactions. These
off-balance sheet hedge transactions are included in the above
GAP table as a separate line item to isolate the impact they had
as a hedge against specific borrowings. These hedge transactions
reduced the negativity of the cumulative six month static GAP by
$90 million or 48.5% and had a minor impact on the one year
cumulative static GAP. Management is cognizant of the interest
rate risk that exists with the increased leveraging of the
balance sheet but is confident that it is being effectively
managed with available board-approved hedging measurement
methods, policies, and cash flow from the investment portfolio.
A portion of the Company's funding base is low cost core deposit
accounts which do not have a specific maturity date. The accounts
which comprise these low cost core deposits include passbook
savings accounts, money market accounts, NOW accounts, daily
interest savings accounts, purpose clubs, etc.. At December 31,
1994, the balance in these accounts totalled $485 million or
27.1% of total assets. Within the above static GAP table,
approximately $143 million or 30% of the total $485 million of
low cost core deposits are assumed to be rate sensitive
liabilities which reprice in one year or less; this 30%
assumption is based upon historical experience in varying
interest rate environments and is consistently used for all GAP
ratios presented. The Company recognizes that the pricing of
these accounts is somewhat inelastic when compared to normal rate
movements and generally assumes that up 

<PAGE>66

to a 250 basis point increase in rates will not necessitate a
change in the cost of these accounts. Indeed, throughout 1994 the
Company has been able to hold steady the pricing of these
accounts despite six Federal Reserve rate movements which caused
a total 250 basis point increase in both the fed funds and prime
rate. Given intensifying competitive pressures and the widening
of the gap between the rates paid on these core accounts and
certificates of deposit, the Company expects that it may have to
increase the rate paid on the majority of these accounts by a
minimum of 25-50 basis points in 1995; such potential rate
increases would add pre-tax annual interest expense for the
Company of $1.2 million to $2.4 million. The probability of
increasing the rates on these low cost accounts was further
intensified by the February 1, 1995, Federal Reserve action to
increase interest rates by an additional 50 basis points. This
action further magnified the difference between the low cost core
account rates and certificates of deposit rates to approximately
500 basis points. This spread, left unattended, will most likely
contribute to increased migration of dollars from low cost
accounts into longer-term certificates of deposit as evidenced by
the migration witnessed in the fourth quarter. The Company will
continue to explore strategies, such as off-balance sheet hedging
transactions and on-balance sheet extension of the liability
base, to further mitigate the impact of any future rate increases
on these accounts and unfavorable mix shifts in a rising rate
environment.
There are some inherent limitations in using static GAP analysis
to measure and manage interest rate risk. For instance, certain
assets and liabilities may have similar maturities or periods to
repricing but the magnitude or degree of the repricing may vary
significantly with changes in market interest rates. As a result
of these GAP limitations, management places considerable emphasis
on simulation modeling to manage and measure interest rate risk.
At December 31, 1994, these varied economic interest rate
simulations indicated that the maximum negative variability of
USBANCORP's net interest income over the next twelve month period
was (5.6%) under an upward rate shock forecast reflecting an
immediate 275 basis point increase in interest rates. The impact
on capital under this simulation was estimated to be less than
(2.0%). A more moderate near-term forecast simulation reflecting
a 125 basis point increase in rates indicates net interest income
variability of (1.2%) and capital impairment of less than 1.0%.
The Company's asset liability management policy seeks to limit
net interest income variability to + or - 5%.

With the adoption of SFAS #115 in the first quarter of 1994,
33.1% of the investment portfolio is currently classified as
available for sale and 66.9% as held to maturity. The available
for sale classification provides management with greater
flexibility to more actively manage the securities portfolio to
better achieve overall balance sheet rate sensitivity goals.
Furthermore, it is the Company's intent to continue to diversify
its loan portfolio to increase liquidity and rate sensitivity and
to better manage USBANCORP's long-term interest rate risk by
continuing to sell newly originated 30 year fixed-rate mortgage
loans. The Company will retain all servicing rights at its newly
acquired mortgage banking subsidiary (Standard Mortgage
Corporation of Georgia) and recognize fee income over the
remaining lives of the loans sold at an average rate of
approximately 30 basis points on the loan balances outstanding.

<PAGE>67


LIQUIDITY...Financial institutions must maintain liquidity to
meet day-to-day requirements of depositor and borrower customers,
take advantage of market opportunities, and provide a cushion
against unforeseen needs. Liquidity needs can be met by either
reducing assets or increasing liabilities. Sources of asset
liquidity are provided by short-term investment securities, time
deposits with banks, federal funds sold, banker's acceptances,
and commercial paper. These assets totalled $146 million at
December 31, 1994, compared to $151 million at December 31, 1993.
Maturing and repaying loans, as well as, the monthly cash flow
associated with certain asset- and mortgage-backed securities are
other sources of asset liquidity.
Liability liquidity can be met by attracting deposits with
competitive rates, using repurchase agreements, buying federal
funds, or utilizing the facilities of the Federal Reserve or the
Federal Home Loan Bank systems. USBANCORP's subsidiaries utilize
a variety of these methods of liability liquidity. At December
31, 1994, USBANCORP's subsidiaries had approximately $55 million
of unused lines of credit available under informal arrangements
with correspondent banks compared to $89.6 million at December
31, 1993. These lines of credit enable USBANCORP's subsidiaries
to purchase funds for short-term needs at current market rates.
Additionally, each of the Company's subsidiary banks are members
of the Federal Home Loan Bank which provides the opportunity to
obtain intermediate to longer term advances up to approximately
80% of their investment in assets secured by one- to four-family
residential real estate. This would suggest a remaining current
total available Federal Home Loan Bank aggregate borrowing
capacity of approximately $474 million. Furthermore, USBANCORP
had available at December 31, 1994, $1.5 million of a total $2.5
million unsecured line of credit.
Liquidity can be further analyzed by utilizing the Consolidated
Statement of Cash Flows. Cash equivalents increased by $3.5
million from December 31, 1993, to December 31, 1994. Both the
financing and investing activities were significantly impacted by
the JSB acquisition. Investing activities also disclose that
purchases of investment securities exceeded the cash proceeds
from investment security maturities and sales by approximately
$180 million. To a much lesser extent, cash advanced for new loan
fundings exceeded the cash received from loan principal payments
and sales by approximately $15 million. Within financing
activities, there was a net $102 million increase in Federal Home
Loan Bank advances and a $164 million net increase in short-term
borrowings. Cash provided from these financing activities was
used to execute the increased leveraging of the Company's balance
sheet during 1994.
EFFECTS OF INFLATION...USBANCORP's asset and liability structure
is primarily monetary in nature. As such, USBANCORP's assets and
liabilities tend to move in concert with inflation. While changes
in interest rates may have an impact on the financial performance
of the banking industry, interest rates do not necessarily move
in the same direction or in the same magnitude as prices of other
goods and services and may frequently reflect government policy
initiatives or economic factors not measured by a price index.

compliance with the required regulatory capital ratios for each

</TABLE>

The decline in each of the regulatory capital ratios between
December 31, 1994, and December 31, 1993, was due to the
execution of several strategic initiatives which allowed the
Company to better leverage its capital strength in an effort to
enhance total shareholder return. The JSB acquisition had the
most significant impact because the $24.1 million increase in
capital resulting from the new common shares issued was basically
offset by the $25.9 million intangible asset created from the
acquisition. The implementation of the board approved treasury
stock buyback program during the second half of 1994 resulted in
the purchase of 127,700 shares at a total cost of $3.1 million.
Additionally, the execution of the previously discussed $122
million leverage program increased total assets without any
increase in equity. Each of these strategic initiatives,
including an increased common stock dividend, contributed to
enhanced leverage of the Company's capital base.
Even with the increased leverage of capital in 1994, the Company
exceeds all regulatory capital ratios for each of the periods
presented. Furthermore, each of the Company's subsidiary banks
are considered "well capitalized" under all applicable FDIC
regulations. It is the Company's ongoing intent to prudently
leverage the capital base in an effort to increase return on
equity performance while maintaining necessary capital
requirements. It is, however, the Company's intent to maintain
the FDIC "well capitalized" classification for each of its
subsidiaries to ensure the lowest deposit insurance premium and
to maintain an asset leverage ratio of no less than 6.0%.
The Company's declared Common Stock cash dividend per share was
$0.97 for 1994 which was a 12.8% increase over the $0.86 per
share dividend for 1993. The dividend yield on the Company's
Common Stock now approximates 4.5% compared to an average
Pennsylvania bank holding company yield of approximately 3.0%.
The Company remains committed to a progressive total shareholder
return which includes a common dividend yield at slightly higher
than peer levels.

PART I
ITEM 1. BUSINESS
General
USBANCORP, Inc. (the "Company") is a registered bank holding
company organized under the Pennsylvania Business Corporation Law
and is registered under the Bank Holding Company Act of 1956, as
amended (the "BHCA.") The Company became a holding company upon
acquiring all of the outstanding shares of United States National
Bank in Johnstown ("U.S. Bank") on January 5, 1983. The Company
also acquired all of the outstanding shares of Three Rivers Bank
and Trust Company ("Three Rivers Bank") in June 1984, McKeesport
National Bank ("McKeesport Bank") on December 1, 1985 (which was
subsequently merged into Three Rivers Bank), and Community
Bancorp, Inc. (whose sole direct subsidiary is Community Savings
Bank) in March 1992. On June 30, 1994, the Company acquired
Johnstown Savings Bank, a $367 million savings bank headquartered
in Johnstown, PA.  The Company merged JSB with and into U.S. Bank
with U.S. Bank surviving the merger. The separate existence of
JSB ceased, and all property, rights, powers, duties,
obligations, and liabilities of JSB were automatically
transferred to U.S. Bank in accordance with Federal and
Pennsylvania law. Immediately following the Merger, U.S. Bank
caused the intracompany sale by Standard Mortgage Corporation of
Georgia, a wholly-owned subsidiary of JSB, of all its assets,
subject to all of its liabilities, to SMC Acquisition
Corporation, an indirect subsidiary of Community. SMC Acquisition
Corporation was renamed Standard Mortgage Corporation of Georgia
and is a mortgage banking company organized under the laws of the
State of Georgia and originates, sells, and services residential
mortgage loans. In addition, the Company formed United Bancorp
Life Insurance Company ("United Life") in October 1987 and
USBANCORP Trust Company (the "Trust Company") in October 1992.
The Company's principal activities consist of owning and
operating its five wholly-owned subsidiary entities. At December
31, 1994, the Company had, on a consolidated basis, total assets,
deposits, and stockholders' equity of $1.79 billion, $1.20
billion and $137 million, respectively.
The Company and the subsidiary entities derive substantially all
their income from banking and bank-related services. The Company
functions primarily as a coordinating and servicing unit for its
subsidiary entities in general management, credit policies and
procedures, accounting and taxes, loan review, auditing,
investment advisory, compliance, marketing, insurance risk
management, general corporate services, and financial and
strategic planning.
The Company, as a bank holding company, is regulated under the
BHCA, and is supervised by the Board of Governors of the Federal
Reserve System (the "Board.") In general, the Act limits the
business of bank holding companies to owning or controlling banks
and engaging in such other activities as the Board may determine
to be so closely related to banking or managing or controlling
banks as to be a proper incident thereto.
USBANCORP Banking Subsidiaries:
U.S. Bank
U.S. Bank is a national banking association organized under the
laws of the United States. Through 21 locations in Cambria,
Clearfield, Somerset, and Westmoreland Counties, Pennsylvania,
U.S. Bank conducts a general banking business. It is a
full-service bank offering (i) retail banking services, such as
demand, savings and time 

<PAGE>74

deposits, money market accounts, secured and unsecured loans,
mortgage loans, safe deposit boxes, holiday club accounts,
collection services, money orders, and traveler's checks; (ii)
lending, depository and related financial services to commercial,
industrial, financial, and governmental customers, such as real
estate-mortgage loans, short- and medium-term loans, revolving
credit arrangements, lines of credit, inventory and accounts
receivable financing, personal and commercial property lease
financing, real estate-construction loans, business savings
accounts, certificates of deposit, wire transfers, night
depository, and lock box services; and (iii) credit card
operations through MasterCard and VISA. U.S. Bank also operates
22 automated bank teller machines ("ATM") through its 24 Hour
Banking Network which is linked with MAC and HONOR, regional ATM
networks, and CIRRUS, a national ATM network.
U.S. Bank's deposit base is such that loss of one depositor or a
related group of depositors would not have a materially adverse
effect on its business. In addition, the loan portfolio is also
diversified so that one industry or group of related industries
does not comprise a material portion of the loan portfolio.
U.S. Bank's business is not seasonal nor does it have any risks
attendant to foreign sources.
Since U.S. Bank is federally chartered, it is subject to primary
supervision of the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency.
U.S. Bank is also subject to the regulations of the Board of
Governors of the Federal Reserve Bank and the Federal Deposit
Insurance Corporation.

Three Rivers Bank
Three Rivers Bank is a state bank chartered under the
Pennsylvania Banking Code of 1965, as amended (the "Pennsylvania
Banking Code.") Through 12 locations in Allegheny and Washington
Counties, Pennsylvania, Three Rivers Bank conducts a general
retail banking business consisting of granting commercial,
consumer, construction, mortgage and student loans, and offering
checking, interest bearing demand, savings and time deposit
services. It also operates 12 ATMs which are

<PAGE>75

affiliated with MAC, a regional ATM network, and Plus System, a
national ATM network. Three Rivers Bank also offers wholesale
banking services to other banks, merchants, governmental units,
and other large commercial accounts. Such services include
balancing services, lock box accounts, and providing coin and
currency. Three Rivers Bank has an arrangement with Statewide
Security Transport, Inc. (which conducts business under the name
of Landmark Security Transport) pursuant to which it also
provides cash collection and deposit services to its customers.
Three Rivers Bank's deposit base is such that loss of one
depositor or a related group of depositors would not have a
materially adverse effect on its business. In addition, the loan
portfolio is also diversified so that one industry or group of
related industries does not comprise a material portion of the
loan portfolio.
 Three Rivers Bank's business is not seasonal nor does it have
any risks attendant to foreign sources.
As a state chartered, federally-insured bank and trust company
which is not a member of the Federal Reserve System, Three Rivers
Bank is subject to supervision and regular examination by the
Pennsylvania Department of Banking and the Federal Deposit
Insurance Corporation. Various federal and state laws and
regulations govern many aspects of its banking operations.

Community
As part of the Company's strategy of expanding in suburban
Pittsburgh, in March 1992, USBANCORP acquired Community Bancorp,
Inc., which subsequently became a bank holding company regulated
under the BHCA and supervised by the Federal Reserve Board, and
its sole direct subsidiary, Community Savings Bank ("Community.")
Community is a Pennsylvania-chartered savings bank registered
under the Pennsylvania Banking Code. Community currently conducts
its banking operation through 12 locations in Allegheny,
Washington, and Westmoreland counties,

<PAGE>76

Pennsylvania. Traditionally, Community originated and held
fixed-rate residential mortgage loans which were funded primarily
by certificates of deposit and offered a few fee-based services.
Under the direction of personnel transferred to Community from
U.S. Bank and Three Rivers Bank, Community has begun the process
of expanding its product offerings through the introduction of
commercial lending and expanded consumer lending and deposit
gathering in order to position it as a full service community
bank.
As part of the Community acquisition, USBANCORP acquired
Community's direct subsidiaries: Community First Capital
Corporation (a special purpose finance subsidiary), Community
First Financial Corporation (a subsidiary engaged in real estate
joint ventures with assets totalling $1.3 million), and Frontier
Consumer Discount Company. Additionally, as part of the JSB
acquisition on June 30, 1994, Standard Mortgage Corporation
became a direct subsidiary of Community as a result of the
intra-company purchase of all its assets, subject to all its
liabilities. Standard Mortgage Corporation is a mortgage banking
company that originates, sells, and services residential mortgage
loans. In accordance with Federal Reserve policy, USBANCORP has
committed to divest its equity investment in Community First
Financial Corporation by March 22, 1995, or such longer period as
the Federal Reserve Board may approve.
Community's deposit base is such that loss of one depositor or a
related group of depositors would not have a materially adverse
effect on its business. In addition, the loan portfolio contains
a high portion of residential mortgage and consumer loans that
have less credit risk associated with them. In addition, the loan
portfolio is also diversified so that one industry or group of
related industries does not comprise a material portion of the
loan portfolio.
Community's business is not seasonal nor does it have any risks
attendant to foreign sources.
As a Pennsylvania-chartered, federally-insured savings bank that
is not a member of the Federal Reserve System, Community Savings
Bank is subject to supervision and regular examination by the
Pennsylvania Department of Banking and the FDIC. Various federal
and state laws and regulations also govern many aspects of its
banking and bank-related operations.

Monetary Policies
Commercial banks are affected by policies of various regulatory
authorities including the Federal Reserve System. An important
function of the Federal Reserve System is to regulate the
national supply of bank credit. Among the instruments of monetary
policy used by the Board of Governors are: open market operations
in U.S. Government securities, changes in the discount rate on
member bank borrowings, and changes in reserve requirements on
bank deposits. These means are used in varying combinations to
influence overall growth of bank loans, investments, and
deposits, and may also affect interest rate charges on loans or
interest paid for deposits. The monetary policies of the Board of
Governors have had a significant effect on the operating results
of commercial banks in the past and are expected to continue to
do so in the future. In view of changing conditions in the
national economy and the money markets (as well as the effect of
actions by monetary and fiscal authorities including the Board of
Governors), no prediction can be made as to possible future
changes in interest rates, deposit levels or loan demand, or as
to the impact of such changes on the business and earnings of the
Company and its subsidiary entities.
Competition
The subsidiary entities face strong competition from other
commercial banks, savings banks, savings and loan associations,
and several other financial or investment service institutions
for business in the communities they serve. Several of these
institutions are affiliated with major banking and financial
institutions, such as Mellon Bank Corporation and PNC Financial
Corporation, which are substantially larger and have greater
financial resources than the subsidiary entities.
As the financial services industry continues to consolidate, the
scope of potential competition affecting the subsidiary entities
will also increase. For most of the services that the subsidiary
entities perform, there is also competition from credit unions
and issuers of commercial paper and money market funds. Such
institutions, as well as brokerage houses, consumer finance
companies, factors, insurance companies, and pension trusts, are
important competitors for various types of financial services. In
addition, personal and corporate trust investment counseling
services are offered by insurance companies, other firms, and
individuals.
Market Area
The Company, headquartered in Johnstown, Pennsylvania, operates
through 45 branch offices in six southwestern Pennsylvania
counties with a combined population of approximately 2.2 million:
Allegheny, Cambria, Clearfield, Somerset, Washington, and
Westmoreland. With the acquisition of Johnstown Savings Bank, the
Company's largest subsidiary, U.S. Bank has 21 offices and a $1.1
billion asset presence primarily in the Greater Johnstown
marketplace. U.S. Bank now has a leading 25% deposit market share
in Cambria County. Community Bank and Three Rivers Bank have a
combined 24 offices and a $734 million asset presence in the
western region, largely comprised of the suburban Pittsburgh
marketplace.
The Pennsylvania economy appears to be slowing down as the
nation-at-large continues to enjoy a faster growth rate. The
strongest economic activity in Pennsylvania seems to be
concentrated in the southeast and central regions of the state.
Retail sales, durable goods orders, and consumer real estate
activity continue to foster the expansion. However, the statewide
seasonally adjusted unemployment rate for December 1994 increased
slightly to 5.9%, compared with the seasonally adjusted December
1993 unemployment rate of 5.8%. It must be emphasized, however,
that Pennsylvania has spent in excess of $2 billion to create
294,000 jobs since the beginning of 1987; further more, each
public dollar spent has been leveraged to an additional $2.55
from the private

<PAGE>79

sector over this same time period. The Company believes that as
the national economy begins to slow, the conditions in the state
will continue to slowly improve throughout 1995 as a result of
this strong historic public and private sector support for jobs
creation. Furthermore, Pennsylvania has separate House and Senate
bills in committee which attempt to relieve both the buyer and
the lender of any responsibility for pollution from former
owners. This law could be in place by Spring of 1995 and
continues the recent history of creating a state eagerly
receptive to new business development.
The Greater Johnstown economy is trailing Pennsylvania and the
nation; however, the seasonally adjusted unemployment rate for
December 1994 dropped to 8.5% compared with 9.0% for December
1993. Recent economic activity in the Johnstown region includes:
The Johnstown Industrial Park, which accommodates new business
and manufacturing ventures, has reached its capacity, leading to
the development of a second 68 acre industrial park.
Attracting defense industry contracts, the goal of a proactive
community business development plan, has resulted in $156.2
million in defense contracts and more than 650 new jobs since
1990.
Veritas Capital, Inc. has agreed to the purchase of the Conemaugh
& Blacklick Railroad and the Manufacturers Water Company,
Bethlehem Steel Corporation's only remaining Johnstown operation.
The Erie Sailors of the independent Frontier League entered a
three year lease with the City of Johnstown to move the baseball
team to the Point Stadium. The Point Stadium will receive funds
from the state of Pennsylvania for renovations to upgrade the
facility for the new minor league baseball franchise.
Several small, diversified steel production companies are
expected to hire nearly 2,500 high-skilled local steel workers.
Local tradesmen and subcontractors are expecting roles in the
construction of a $30 million Army Reserve aviation facility near
the Johnstown airport.
As evidenced by the above, Greater Johnstown continues to shift
from an over-reliance on heavy industry to a more diversified
economy including more light manufacturing and service related
businesses. This diversification of the local economy is further
exemplified by the nature of the ten largest non-government
employers in the region which include: three hospitals; a
state-wide electric utility; a regional food retailer; a steel
manufacturer; a ladies apparel manufacturer; a national life
insurance company; and a long distance trucking company.
The Greater Pittsburgh region, where Three Rivers Bank and
Community operate, is benefitting from the national economic
expansion. Manufacturing, retail housing, and new auto sales have
all seen expansionary activity. Overall office building leasing
has been steady throughout 1994, with special strength noted in
the Oakland, Parkway West, and North suburban markets. Suburban
office space is expected to be a popular investment in 1995. With
vacancy rates trending downward, effective rental rates climbing,
and little new space being created, suburban office space is
becoming less readily available. It is quite possible that 1995
may see the return of speculative office construction in the
Pittsburgh suburbs. Recent economic activity in the Pittsburgh
region includes:
Lukens Steel Co. announced a $6.4 million project at its
Washington Steel plant, Washington County, that will increase
production by 14,000 tons or 5.0%.
Hillman Company is divesting a significant portion of its
nationwide real estate holdings.

<PAGE>80

The Southwestern Pennsylvania Planning Commission, covering the
six-county Pittsburgh region, has adopted a $14.7 billion
transportation plan aimed at improving the area's highway and
mass transit system over the next 20 years.
Hospitality Franchise Systems, Inc. purchased 130 acres along the
Monongahela River. Hospitality is interested in a riverboat
gambling operation for the site. Other smaller lot purchases for
this purpose have also been made in 1994 in reaction to the
Pittsburgh mayor's active support of this revenue concept.
$13.5 million in funding was approved for projects at Three
Rivers Stadium, $2.5 million for the renovation of Heinz Hall and
$2 million for the development of the Steel Heritage Center.
The Commonwealth of Pennsylvania granted $6 million to NASA
Robotics Engineering Consortium to help convert an abandoned
industrial site on the Allegheny River to a robotics research
center.
U.S. Steel has agreed to a two year contract with General Motors
Corp. which could boost steel prices by as much as 16%.
Links Development Co. is developing a $32 million residential and
retail development along a major transportation artery.
The Pittsburgh economy is generally well diversified as
exemplified by the ten largest non-government employers in the
region which include: USAir; the University of Pittsburgh;
Westinghouse; two money center banks; USX Corporation; a
multi-state grocery retailer; and a multi-state restaurant chain.
The Company believes that the state and regional economies will
continue this diversification and show modest improvement
throughout 1995. Consequently, the Company's marketplace should
continue to display modest strengthening.
Employees
The Company employed approximately 780 persons as of December 31,
1994, in full- and part-time positions. Approximately 235
non-supervisory employees of U.S. Bank are represented by a
union. U.S. Bank and such employees are parties to a labor
contract pursuant to which employees have agreed not to engage in
any work stoppage during the term of the contract which will
expire on October 15, 1995. U.S. Bank has not experienced a work
stoppage since 1979. Management considers relations with
employees to be satisfactory.
Commitments and Lines of Credit
The Company's banking subsidiaries are obligated under
commercial, standby, and trade-related irrevocable letters of
credit aggregating $6.4 million at December 31, 1994. In
addition, the subsidiary banks have issued lines of credit to
customers generally for periods of up to one year. Borrowings
under such lines of credit are usually for the working capital
needs of the borrower. At December 31, 1994, the Company's
banking subsidiaries had unused loan commitments of approximately
$161.8 million.

Investment Portfolio
Effective January 1, 1994, the Company adopted Statement of
Financial Accounting Standards ("SFAS") #115, "Accounting for
Certain Investments in Debt and Equity Securities." This
statement addresses the accounting and reporting for investments
in equity securities that have readily determinable fair values
and for all investments in debt securities. Investment securities
held to maturity are carried at amortized cost while investment
securities classified as available for sale are reported at fair
value. At December 31, 1994, approximately 67% of the portfolio
was categorized as held to maturity and 33% as available for
sale. Prior to the adoption of SFAS #115, the entire securities
portfolio was classified as available for sale and carried at the
lower of amortized cost or market value.
The following table sets forth the book and market value of
USBANCORP's investment portfolio as of the periods indicated:

The $364.5 million increase in 1994 can be attributed to the
following: $190.1 million securities acquired through the
acquisition of Johnstown Savings Bank, and a $122 million
increase due primarily to increased leveraging of the Company's
balance sheet through the utilization of funding sources from the
Federal Home Loan Bank. Subsequent to the JSB acquisition, the
Company elected to sell approximately 90% of JSB's securities
portfolio (see further discussion under JSB Acquisition on page
50). Within the portfolio, the Company placed an emphasis on the
purchase of mortgage-backed securities, which provide a more
predictable cash flow stream than CMO's, and municipal securities
in an effort to generate increased tax-free earnings.
The book value of total investment securities increased from
$366.9 million at December 31, 1992, to $428.7 million at
December 31, 1993. The increase in the total investment
securities was due entirely to the redeployment of a significant
portion of the $88 million of acquired Integra deposits and the
$24.6 million of funds from the secondary market common stock
issuance into the securities portfolio. Within the portfolio, the
decline in other securities reflects a shift in emphasis towards
mortgage-backed securities and collateralized mortgage
obligations which provide a recurrent source of cash flow.
At December 31, 1994, investment securities having a book value
of $275.2million were pledged as collateral for public funds and
other purposes as required by law.
The Company and its subsidiaries, collectively, did not hold
securities of any single issuer, excluding U.S. Treasury and U.S.
Agencies, that exceeded 10% of stockholders' equity at December
31, 1994.
Maintaining investment quality is a primary objective of the
Company's investment policy which, subject to certain minor
exceptions, prohibits the purchase of any investment security
below a Moody's Investor Service or Standard & Poor's rating of
"A." At December 31, 1994, 96.1% of the portfolio was rated "AAA"
and 97.0% was rated at least "AA" as compared to 89.2% and 91.0%,
respectively, at December 31, 1993. Only 0.5% was rated below "A"
or unrated at December 31, 1994.
The following table sets forth the contractual maturity
distribution of the investment securities, book and market
values, and the weighted average yield for each type and range of
maturity as of December 31, 1994. Yields are not presented on a
tax-equivalent basis, are based upon book value and are weighted
for the scheduled maturity. Average maturities are based upon the
original contractual maturity dates with the exception of
mortgage-backed securities and asset-backed securities for which
the average lives were used. Also, where applicable, put-dates
were used as the maturity dates. At December 31, 1994,
USBANCORP's consolidated investment securities portfolio had an
average contractual maturity of approximately 15.05 years and an
average cash flow payback of approximately 3.67 years.

During 1994 and 1993, the Company sold approximately $168 million
and $22 million, respectively, of investment securities available
for sale which resulted in the realization of net investment
security losses of $3,972,000 and net investment security gains
of $583,000, respectively. The 1994 loss resulted primarily from
an investment portfolio repositioning strategy executed late in
the fourth quarter which was designed to enhance future net
interest income performance (see complete discussion under Net
Interest Income and Margin on page 49). The 1993 gains resulted
from several investment strategies to capture available market
premiums on mortgage-backed securities which had the
characteristics of low remaining balances and fast prepayment
histories.

<F1>At December 31, 1994, and 1993, real estate-construction loans

</TABLE>

Excluding the $125.6 million of loans acquired with the JSB
acquisition and the $17 million of student loans sold, total
loans and loans held for sale also increased by $32.2 million or
4.4% since year-end 1993. This growth occurred primarily in the
second and third quarters of 1994 and reflects the economic
stability and diversification of both regions of the Company's
marketplace - Greater Johnstown and suburban Pittsburgh. The
majority of the loan growth occurred in the commercial loan
portfolio which grew by $11.5 million or 11.6%. The Company
experienced increased demand for both taxable and tax-free
commercial loans in 1994. Total real estate loans (including home
equity products) also grew modestly by 3.7% during 1994 despite
the Company's practice of selling all newly originated 30 year
fixed-rate mortgage loans amounting to approximately $60 million
in 1994. This commercial and mortgage loan growth more than
offset reduced consumer loan balances caused largely by the sale
of the Company's $17 million student loan portfolio late in the
second quarter of 1994. Management elected to divest of this line
of business since future profitability will be adversely impacted
by scheduled changes in regulations and servicing requirements.
Consumer loan balances have also been negatively impacted by
intense competitive pressures in the indirect auto loan business
segment.
From December 31, 1992, to December 31, 1993, loans increased by
$72.2million or 10.9% from $659.8 million to $732.0 million. As a
result of the low rate environment, less inflationary fears, and
a moderate economic recovery, each of the Company's banking
subsidiaries experienced heightened loan demand in 1993. Within
the loan portfolio, each of the major loan categories experienced
growth in the following amounts since December 31, 1992:
commercial loans up by $22.7 million or 29.5%, real
estate-mortgage loans up by $39.8 million or 13.3%, consumer
loans up by $9.5 million or 6.0%, and commercial loans secured by
real estate up by $200,000 or only .2%. The commercial loan
growth resulted from successful business development efforts in
both regions of the Company's marketplace which includes suburban
Pittsburgh and Greater Johnstown. The net growth in mortgage

<PAGE>85


loans (including home equity) occurred despite the sale of
approximately $22 million of 30 year fixed-rate product that
originated during 1993. The majority of the mortgage growth
occurred at Community with approximately 60% of this growth
related to refinancing activity with new customers. The net
growth of consumer loans outstanding is noteworthy since it
represents a significant reversal of the trend of net consumer
loan run-off which had occurred throughout 1992. Improved
consumer demand, acquisition of Integra loans, and heavy
marketing of debt consolidation loans, combined with a general
stabilizing of indirect auto loan run-off, were the factors
responsible for the increase in consumer loan balances
outstanding.
The amount of loans outstanding by category as of December 31,
1994, which are due in (i) one year or less, (ii) more than one
year through five years, and(iii) over five years, are shown in
the following table. Loan balances are also categorized according
to their sensitivity to changes in interest rates.

The loan maturity information is based upon original loan terms
and is not adjusted for "rollovers." In the ordinary course of
business, loans maturing within one year may be renewed, in whole
or in part, as to principal amount at interest rates prevailing
at the date of renewal.
At December 31, 1994, 73.1% of total loans were fixed-rate
compared to 71.6% at December 31, 1993. Total real estate loans
(including home equity products) grew modestly by 3.7% during
1994 despite the Company's practice of selling all newly
originated 30 year fixed-rate mortgage loans amounting to
approximately $60 million in 1994. During 1993, $22 million of
this type of loan product was sold. For additional information

The Company's deposits, excluding JSB, decreased $43 million or
4.1% since December 31, 1993. The decline in deposits can be
attributed to management's application of the previously
discussed pricing philosophy which emphasizes profitable net
interest margin management rather than increased deposit size.
This deposit pricing strategy was maintained during a period of
aggressively increasing competitive deposit rates particularly in
the Greater Pittsburgh suburban area. Regarding the JSB
acquisition, the Company used quality customer service to achieve
its goal of retaining over 90% of the total deposits acquired in
this intra-market consolidation.
The following table indicates the maturities and amounts of
certificates of deposit issued in denominations of $100,000 or
more as of December 31, 1994:

Annex A

ANNEX A TO USBANCORP, INC. 1994 ANNUAL REPORT & FORM 10-K

The following is a listing of the graphs presented in USBANCORP,
Inc.'s 1994 Annual Report & Form 10-K.

Page 2: The following six graphs present Financial Highlights-
        At A Glance:

          The first graph is an area graph showing non-performing 
        assets as a percentage of loans and OREO at December 31 for 
        the periods presented:

        1990      1991     1992     1993    1994
        0.87%     1.10%    1.58%    0.89%   0.91%


        Asset quality is critical to a bank's safety and ongoing  
        earnings power.  Non-performing assets are those loans and 
        foreclosed properties that are not generating income and  
        represent high collection risk.  USBANCORP's non-performing 
        assets are significantly lower than peer. 

          The second graph is a bar graph showing the allowance for 
        loan losses as a percentage of total non-accrual loans at 
        December 31 for the periods presented:    

        1990      1991     1992     1993     1994
        507.74%  387.22%  245.75%  287.71%  286.27% 
        
        The allowance for loan losses helps protect a bank's future 
        earnings from losses due to credit risk.  USBANCORP's     
        allowance reflects a reserve of $2.86 for each $1.00 of   
        non-accrual loans. 

          The third graph is an area graph showing net overhead   
        expense (excluding acquisition charge) to average assets: 
        
        1990     1991     1992     1993      1994
        2.89%    3.01%    2.68%    2.51%     2.32%

        Note: The 1994 net overhead expense calculations exclude  
        $3.8 million net security losses recognized in the fourth 
        quarter which resulted from a specific investment portfolio 
        restructuring strategy.  

        Net overhead expense as a percentage of average assets    
        reflects a company's ability to generate non-interest     
        income and control its non-interest expenses.  Over the   
        last five years USBANCORP has significantly improved its  
        performance in this key area of non-interest sensitive    
        profitability.



           The fourth graph is a bar graph showing assets per full 
        time equivalent employee at December 31 for the periods   
        presented (in thousands):
  
         1990      1991     1992     1993     1994
         $1,447   $1,499   $1,770   $1,867   $2,293 

        We are aggressively capturing the financial benefits from 
        each of our past acquisitions, including our most recent  
        intra-market merger.  Improved employee productivity is   
        one such integral benefit from our acquisitions.

           The fifth graph is a bar graph showing the return on   
        equity before extraordinary item, SFAS #109 benefit and   
        acquisition charge:

         1990     1991     1992     1993    1994
         10.00%   9.39%    11.41%   10.13%  10.41%

        The return on average equity (ROE) is a standard          
        measurement of a bank's profitability.  Historically, a   
        12.50% to 13.50% ROE was considered above average         
        profitability.  USBANCORP will not be satisfied until this 
        targeted ROE is consistently achieved.

            The sixth graph is a area graph showing net interest  
        margin dollars (in thousands):

        1990     1991     1992      1993     1994
        $31,706  $32,908  $44,441   $49,485  $55,818

        As a result of prudent acquisitions and effective         
        asset/liability management practices, USBANCORP has       
        increased net interest margin dollars for each of the past 
        five years.

Page 4: The following six graphs present Shareholder Information-At 
        A Glance:

          The first graph is a bar graph showing pre-tax income   
        excluding acquisition charge (in thousands):

         1990     1991     1992     1993     1994
        $8,933   $9,181   $14,323  $16,520  $19,688

        USBANCORP's pre-tax income has shown progressive growth.  
        Such income is a key determinant of shareholder value and 
        the Company's ongoing financial soundness.

          The second graph is a bar graph showing dividends per   
        common share:

        1990     1991     1992     1993     1994
        $0.15    $0.55    $0.75    $0.86    $0.97


        Common dividends per share represent a payment by the     
        company from its accumulated shareholder wealth.  When this 
        cash is paid to the shareholder it is no longer available 
        to the company.  Many shareholders, however, choose to    
        reinvest these dividends in the company.

           The third graph is a bar graph showing common stock    
        price per share at December 31:

        1990    1991    1992    1993     1994
        $12.75  $18.00  $22.00  $23.75   $21.00

        A second key element of shareholder return is the price   
        appreciation of each common share.  USBANCORP's common    
        stock price per share has appreciated 65% since December  
        31, 1990. 

           The fourth graph is a bar graph showing common dividend 
        yield (based upon dividends declared and purchased at     
        average market price each year): 

        1990     1991    1992     1993    1994
        1.20%    3.50%   3.70%    3.50%   4.20%

        The common dividend yield is similar to the interest rate 
        on a deposit.  Common dividends are only one element of   
        total shareholder return.  Common dividend yields for     
        Pennsylvania bank holding companies were, as of January 31, 
        1995, 3.0%.  USBANCORP's yield approximated 4.5%.

          The fifth graph is a bar graph showing book value per   
        common share - December 31:
 
        1990     1991     1992     1993     1994
        $19.85   $21.71   $23.08   $24.67   $24.57

        A company's book value per common share represents the    
        accumulated and undistributed shareholder wealth.  This   
        wealth is used by the company to finance profitable growth 
        and to fund shareholder dividends.  USBANCORP has increased 
        this shareholder wealth by 24% since December 31, 1990.

           The sixth graph is an area graph showing asset leverage 
        ratio compared to the management minimum target of 6%:

        1990       1991     1992     1993      1994
        8.05%      8.56%    7.08%    9.18%     6.64%

        Fundamental to shareholder and depositor safety is the    
        capital strength of the financial institution.  USBANCORP 
        well exceeds all governmental regulatory capital          
        requirements.  As we did during 1994, the Company will    
        continue to pursue several strategic alternatives to      
        leverage this capital strength in 1995.

                     1990     1991     1992     1993     1994   
        NII          $31,706  $32,908  $44,441  $49,485  $55,818

                                ARTICLE VI 

     Section 6.1.   Limitation of Liability.  To the fullest extent
permitted by the Law of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania, a
director of the Corporation shall not be personally liable to the
Corporation or others for monetary damages for any action taken or
any failure to take any action, unless the director has breached or
failed to perform the duties of his or her office and such breach
or failure constitutes self-dealing, willful misconduct or
recklessness.  The provisions of this Section 6.1 shall not apply
with respect to the responsibility or liability of a director under
any criminal statute or the liability of a director for the payment
of taxes pursuant to local, state or federal law.

     Section 6.2.   Indemnification.  (a)  The Corporation shall
indemnify any person who was or is a party or is threatened to be
made a party to any threatened, pending or completed action, suit
or proceeding, whether civil, criminal, administrative or
investigative, by reason of the fact that such person is or was a
director, officer, employee or agent of the Corporation, or is or
was
serving, at the request of the Corporation, as a director, officer,
employee or agent of another corporation, partnership, joint
venture, trust or other enterprise, against expenses (including
attorneys' fees), amounts paid in settlement, judgments, and fines
actually and reasonably incurred by such person in connection with 

                                    11
such action, suit, or proceeding; provided, however, that no
indemnification shall be made in any case where the act or failure
to act giving rise to the claim for indemnification is determined
by a court to have constituted willful misconduct or recklessness.

     (b)  Advance of Expenses.  Expenses (including attorneys'
fees) incurred in defending a civil or criminal action, suit, or
proceeding shall be paid by the Corporation in advance of the final
disposition of such action, suit, or proceeding, upon receipt of a
written statement by or on behalf of the director, officer,
employee, or agent to repay such amount if it shall be ultimately
determined that he or she is not entitled to be indemnified by the
Corporation as authorized in this Article VI.

     (c)  Indemnification not Exclusive.  The indemnification and
advancement of expenses provided by this Article VI shall not be
deemed exclusive of any other right to which persons seeking
indemnification and advancement of expenses may be entitled under
any agreement, vote of disinterested directors or otherwise, both
as to actions in such persons' official capacity and as to their
actions in another capacity while holding office, and shall
continue as to a person who has ceased to be a director, officer,
employee, or agent and shall inure to the benefit of the heirs,
executors, and administrators of such person.

     (d)  Insurance, Contracts, Security.  The Corporation may
purchase and maintain insurance on behalf of any person, may enter
into contracts of indemnification with any person, and may create
a fund of any nature which may, but need not be, under the control
of a trustee for the benefit of any person, and may otherwise
secure in any manner its obligations with respect to
indemnification and advancement of expenses, whether arising under
this Article VI or otherwise, whether or not the Corporation would
have the power to indemnify such person against such liability
under the provisions of this Article VI.

     Section 6.3.   Effect of Amendment.  Any repeal or
modification of this Article VI shall be prospective only, and
shall not adversely affect any limitation on the personal liability
of a director of the Corporation or any right of any person to
indemnification from the Corporation with respect to any action or
failure to take any action occurring prior to the time of such
repeal or modification.

     Section 6.4.   Severability.  If, for any reason, any
provision of this Article VI shall be held invalid, such invalidity
shall not affect any other provision not held so invalid, and each
such other provision shall, to the full extent consistent with law,
continue in full force and effect.  If any provision of this
Article VI shall be held invalid in part, such invalidity shall in
no way affect the remainder of such provision, and the remainder

                                    12
of such provision, together with all other provisions of this
Article VI, shall, to the full extent consistent with law, continue
in full force and effect.

                                ARTICLE VII

                       Stock and Stock Certificates

     Section 7.1.   Transfers.  Shares of stock shall be
transferable on the books of the Corporation, and a transfer book
shall be kept in which all transfers of stock shall be recorded. 
Every person becoming a shareholder by such transfer shall, in
proportion to his shares, succeed to all rights of the prior holder
of such shares.

     Section 7.2.   Share Certificates.  Every share certificate
shall be signed by the President, or any Vice President, or by any
one of their facsimile signatures, or by the Secretary, or any
Assistant Secretary or by any one of their facsimile signatures,
and shall be signed by a transfer agent.  Every shareholder of
record shall be entitled to a share certificate representing the
shares owned by him or her and, when stock is transferred, the
certificates representing such stock shall be returned to the
Corporation and new certificates issued.  The corporate seal shall
appear on each share certificate and may be a facsimile, engraved 
or printed.  Each certificate shall recite on its face that the
stock represented thereby is transferable only upon the books of
the Corporation, properly endorsed.

     Section 7.3.   Shares of Another Corporation.  Shares owned by
the Corporation in another corporation, domestic or foreign, shall
be voted by the President or such other officer, agent or proxy as
the Board of Directors may determine.

                               ARTICLE VIII 

                         Miscellaneous Provisions

     Section 8.1.   Fiscal Year.  The Fiscal Year of the
Corporation shall be the calendar year.  The Corporation shall be
subject to an annual audit as of the end of its fiscal year by
independent public accountants appointed by and responsible to the
Board of Directors through the Audit Committee.

minutes of each meeting shall be signed by the Secretary or other
officer appointed to act as secretary of the meeting.

                                    13

                                  Bylaws

     Section 9.1.   Inspection.  A copy of the Bylaws, with all
amendments thereto, shall at all times be kept in a convenient
place at the Main Office of the Corporation, and shall be open for
inspection to all shareholders during normal business hours.

     Section 9.2.   Amendments.  These Bylaws may be altered,
amended, added to or repealed by a vote of the majority of the
Board of Directors at any regular meeting of the Board, or at any
special meeting of the Board called for that purpose, except they
shall not make or alter any Bylaw fixing their qualifications,
classification or term of office.  Such action by the Board of
Directors is subject, however, to the general right of the
shareholders to change such action.

EXHIBIT 10.2
                                 AGREEMENT

     THIS AGREEMENT (the "Agreement") made the 22nd day of
June, 1994, by and between USBANCORP, Inc. (the "Company"), a
Pennsylvania corporation, having its principal place of business
at Main and Franklin Streets, Post Office Box 430, Johnstown,
Pennsylvania 15907-0430, and TERRY K. DUNKLE 
("Executive").
     WHEREAS, the Board of Directors of the Company (the "Board")
has determined that it is in the best interest of the Company and
its shareholders to ensure that the Company will have the
continued dedication of the Executive, notwithstanding the
possibility, threat or occurrence of a Change in Control (as
defined below) of the Company.  The Board believes it is
imperative to diminish the inevitable distraction of the
Executive by virtue of the personal uncertainties and risks
created by a pending or threatened Change in Control and to
encourage the Executive's full attention and dedication to
the Company currently and in the event of any threatened or
pending Change in Control, and to provide the Executive with
compensation and benefits arrangements upon a Change in Control
which ensure that the compensation and benefits expectations of
the Executive will be satisfied and which are competitive with
those of other corporations.

     NOW THEREFORE, in consideration of the premises and mutual
covenants contained herein, and intending to be legally bound
hereby, the parties hereto agree as follows:
     
     1.  Term.  This Agreement shall be for a three (3) year
period commencing on the date first set forth above and shall be
automatically renewed on the first and on each subsequent annual
anniversary of the above day and month ("Annual Renewal Date")
for a period ending three (3) years from each Annual Renewal Date
unless either party shall give written notice of non-renewal at
least sixty (60) days prior to the Annual Renewal Date.
     
     2.  Change in Control.  As used in this Agreement, Change in
Control shall mean the occurrence of any of the following:

          (a)  any "person" or "group" (as those terms are
defined or used in Section 13(d) of the Securities Exchange Act
of 1934 (the "Exchange Act"), as enacted and in force on the date
hereof) is or becomes the "beneficial owner" (as that term is
defined in Rule 13d-3 under the Exchange Act, as enacted and in
force on the date hereof) of securities of the Company
representing 24.99% or more of the combined voting power of the
Company's securities then outstanding;

          (b)  there occurs a merger, consolidation, share
exchange, division or other reorganization involving the Company
and another entity in which Company shareholders do 
not continue to hold a majority of the capital stock of the 
resulting entity, or a sale, exchange, transfer, or other
disposition of substantially all of the assets of the  
Company to another entity or other person; or
                                    -2-
          (c)  there occurs a contested proxy solicitation or 
     solicitations of the Company's shareholders which results in
     the contesting party or parties obtaining the ability to
     elect a majority of the members of the Board of Directors
     standing for election at one or more meetings of the
     Company's shareholders.

     3.  Triggering Events.  If a Change in Control shall occur
and if thereafter, at any time during the term of this Agreement
there shall be:
          (a)  any involuntary termination of the Executive by 
     the Company, other than for Cause as defined in Section 4
     below;
          (b)  any reduction in the Executive's title,
responsibilities, including reporting responsibilities, or
authority, including such title, responsibilities, or authority
as such may be increased from time to time during the term of
this Agreement;
          (c)  the assignment to the Executive of duties
inconsistent with the Executive's office as such duties existed
on the day immediately prior to the date of a Change in Control;
          (d)  any reassignment of the Executive to a location 
     greater than twenty-five (25) miles from Johnstown,
     Pennsylvania;  
                                    -3-

          (e)  any reduction in the Executive's annual base 
          salary in effect on the day immediately prior to the
          date of a Change in Control;
          (f)  any failure to continue the Executive's 
participation, on substantially similar terms, in any incentive
compensation or bonus plans of the Company in which the Executive
participated in immediately prior to the Change in Control, or
any change or amendment to any of the substantive provisions of
any of such plans which would materially decrease the potential
benefits to the Executive under any of such plans;
          (g)  any failure to provide the Executive with benefits
     at least as favorable as those enjoyed by the Executive
     under any pension, life insurance, medical, health and
     accident, disability or other employee plans of the Company
     in which the Executive participated in immediately prior to
     the time of the Change in Control, or the taking of any
     action that would materially reduce any of such benefits in
     effect at the time of the Change in Control, unless such
     reduction relates to a reduction in benefits applicable to
     all employees generally; or
          (h)  any breach of any provision of this Agreement by   
     the Company, which breach shall not have been cured by the
     Company within thirty (30) days of the Company's receipt
     from the Executive or his agent of written notice specifying
     in reasonable detail the nature of the Company's breach;
                                    -4-

then Executive, at his sole discretion, may upon no less than 
ninety (90) days written notice to the Company, resign from
employment with the Company (or, if involuntarily terminated,
give notice of intention to collect benefits under this
Agreement) by delivering written notice to the Company at any
time during the term of this Agreement.

     4.  Termination of Executive for Cause.  Upon or following a
Change in Control, the Company shall have the right at any time
to terminate the Executive's employment for Cause.  In such
event, the Company shall give prompt notice to the Executive,
specifying in reasonable detail the basis for such termination. 
For purposes of this Agreement, "Cause" shall mean the following
conduct of the Executive:
          (a)  Material breach of any provision of this
Agreement, which breach Executive shall have failed to cure
within thirty (30) days after Employee's receipt of written
notice from the Company specifying the specific nature of the
Executive's breach;
          (b)  Willful misconduct of Executive that is materially
     inimical to the best interests, monetary or otherwise, of
     the Company;
          (c)  Conviction of a felony or of any crime involving 
     moral turpitude, fraud or deceit;
          (d)  Adjudication as a bankrupt under the United States
     Bankruptcy Code.

                                    -5-

     5.  Compensation and Benefits.  Upon the occurrence of an
event set forth in Section 3 hereof and the delivery of a notice
of termination to the Company pursuant to Section 3 hereof, the
Executive shall be absolutely entitled to receive the
compensation and benefits set forth below:
          (a)  the Executive shall select, in his absolute
discretion, and receive either (i) monthly installments equal to
one thirty-sixth (1/36) of an amount equal to 2.99 times the
following:  (x) During the initial three-year term of this
Agreement (the "Initial Term") commencing on the date hereof, the
highest combined base salary and bonus paid or payable to the
Executive in the then current year or in any one of the last five
fiscal years preceding the Executive's delivery of a notice of
termination; or (y) After the expiration of the Initial Term, the
quotient obtained by dividing the sum of the Executive's combined
salary and bonuses in the five years preceding the Executive's
delivery of a notice of termination by five, such monthly
installments shall be payable for a period of three years (the
"Payment Period") commencing on the first day of the first
calendar month after Executive's delivery of notice of
termination, or (ii) a one time lump sum payment equal to the
non-discounted sum of the payments provided for in Section
5(a)(i) immediately above;
                                    -6-
          (b)  from the date of the notice of termination through
     and including the last day of the Payment Period, the 
     Executive shall be entitled to continue to participate in
     the employee retirement plan(s) of the Company and any
     supplemental executive retirement plan(s) (including
deferred profit sharing plan) or other plan in effect during the
term of this Agreement designed to supplement payments made under
such employee retirement plan, as the case may be, as if the
Executive's employment had not terminated;
          (c)  from the date of the notice of termination through
     and including the last day of the Payment Period, the
     Executive shall be provided with life, disability, and
     medical insurance benefits at levels equivalent to the
     highest levels in effect for the Executive during any one of
     the three (3) calendar years preceding the year in which the
     notice of termination is delivered; and
          (d)  on the date of the notice of termination, all 
     options held by the Executive to acquire common stock of the
     Company, to the extent not immediately exercisable by their
     terms, shall become immediately exercisable, and such
     options shall be exercisable by the Executive at any time
     prior to the earlier of the expiration date(s) of such stock
     options or the date which is ninety (90) days after the
     Executive's termination of employment with the Company.
          (e)  as soon as possible upon a Change in Control, but 
     in no event later than 30 days following a Change in 
                                    -7-

     Control, the Company shall, in accordance with Section
     1.05(b) of the Rabbi Trust Agreement dated June 22, 1994
     between the Company and USBANCORP Trust Company, make an
     irrevocable contribution to the Trust established pursuant
     to such Trust Agreement in an amount that is sufficient to
     guarantee payment to the Participant or his beneficiaries
     the benefits to which they would be entitled to pursuant to
     the terms of any supplemental executive retirement plan(s)
     of the Company as in effect on the date on which the Change
     in Control occurred.
          In the event the Executive is ineligible to continue
participation in the employee retirement plan of the Company
and/or any supplemental executive retirement plan (including
deferred profit sharing plan) or other plan in effect during the 
term of this Agreement designed to supplement payments made under
such employee retirement plan or in any of the Company's life,
disability or medical insurance plans or programs, the Company
shall, in lieu of such participation, pay the Executive a dollar
amount equal to the dollar amount of the benefit forfeited by the
Executive as a result of such ineligibility or a dollar amount
equal to the cost to the Executive to obtain such benefits in the
case of any life, disability or medical insurance plans or
programs.

     6.  Certain Additional Payments by the Company.

Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, in 
                                    -8-
the event it is determined that any payment or distribution by
the Company to or for the benefit of the Executive, whether paid
or payable or distributed or distributable pursuant to the terms
of this Agreement or otherwise (a "Payment"), is subject to the
excise tax imposed by Section 4999 of the Internal Revenue Code
of 1986, as amended (the "Code"), on excess parachute payments,
as that term is used and defined in Sections 4999 and 280G of the
Code, then the Executive shall be entitled to receive an
additional payment (a "Gross-Up Payment") in an amount equal to
the then current rate of tax under said Section 4999 multiplied
by the total of the amount so paid or payable, including this
Gross-Up Payment, which are deemed to be a part of an excess
parachute payment.  All calculations under this provision shall
be made by the Company whose determinations shall be final.
     7.  Beneficiary.  Should the Executive die after entitlement
but prior to payment in full of amounts due pursuant to Section
5(a)(i) hereof, such monthly payments shall continue (if such
payment option was so elected by Executive) to the Executive's
designated beneficiary or his estate until such entitlement has
been paid in full.


     8.  Employment at Will.  This Agreement contains the entire
understanding of the Company and the Executive with respect to
the subject matter hereof and, subject to the provisions of any
other agreement between the Executive and the Company, the
Executive shall remain an employee at will and nothing herein 
                                    -9-
shall confer upon the Executive any right to continued employment
and shall not affect the right of the Company to terminate the
Executive for any reason not prohibited by law; provided,
however, that any such removal shall be without prejudice to any
rights the Executive may have to compensation and benefits as 
provided for in Section 5 hereof.

     9.  Arbitration.  Except as otherwise provided herein, in
the event of any controversy, dispute or claim arising out of, or
relating to this Agreement, or the breach thereof, the parties
may seek recourse only for temporary or preliminary injunctive
relief to the courts having jurisdiction thereof.  If any relief
other than injunctive relief is sought, the Company and the
Executive agree that such underlying controversy, dispute or
claim shall be settled by arbitration conducted in Pittsburgh,
Pennsylvania in accordance with this Section 9 and the Commercial
Arbitration Rules of the American Arbitration Association
("AAA").  The matter shall be heard and decided, and awards
rendered, by a panel of three (3) arbitrators (the "Arbitration
Panel").  The Company and Executive shall each select one
arbitrator from the AAA National Panel of Commercial Arbitrators
(the "Commercial Panel") and AAA shall select a third arbitrator
from the Commercial Panel.  The award rendered by the Arbitration
Panel shall be final and binding as between the parties hereto
and their heirs, executors, administrators, successors and
assigns, and judgment on the award may be entered by any court
having jurisdiction thereof.  Each party shall pay their 
                                   -10-
professional fees, expenses and costs incurred in connection with
the resolution of any controversy, dispute or claim arising out
of, or relating to this Agreement.

     10. Assignment.  This Agreement shall be binding upon and
inure to the benefit of the successors and assigns of the
Company, and the Company shall require any successor to expressly
acknowledge and assume its obligations hereunder.  This Agreement
shall inure to the extent provided hereunder to the benefit of
and be enforceable by the Executive or his/her legal
representatives, executors, administrators, successors, heirs,
distributees, devisees and legatees.  The Executive may not
delegate any of his/her duties, responsibilities, obligations or
positions hereunder to any person and any such purported
delegation by him/her shall be void and of no force and effect.


     11.  Prior Termination.  Anything in this Agreement to the
contrary notwithstanding, if the Executive's employment with 
the Company is terminated prior to the date on which a Change in
Control occurs either (a) by the Company other than for Cause or
(b) by the Executive for any one of the reasons set forth in
Section 3 hereof, and it is reasonably demonstrated that such
termination of employment (i) was at the request of a third party
who has taken steps reasonably calculated to effect the Change in
Control or (ii) otherwise arose in connection with or 
anticipation of the Change in Control, then for all purposes of
this Agreement the termination shall deemed to have occurred upon 
                                   -11-
a Change in Control and the Executive will be entitled to the 
compensation and benefits provided for in Section 5 hereof.

     12.  Release.  The Executive hereby acknowledges and agrees
that prior to the occurrence of the Executive's or his
dependent's right to receive from the Company or any of its
representatives or agents any compensation or benefit to be paid
or provided to him or his dependents pursuant to Section 5 of
this Agreement, the Executive may be required by the Company, in
its sole discretion, to execute a release in a form reasonably
acceptable to the Company, which releases any and all claims the
Executive has or may have against the Company or its
subsidiaries, agents, officers, directors, successors or assigns.

     13.  Compliance with Laws.  The parties hereto acknowledge

EXHIBIT 10.3
                                 AGREEMENT

     This Agreement (the "Agreement") made the 25th day of
October, 1994, by and between USBANCORP, Inc. (the "Company"), a
Pennsylvania corporation, having its principal place of business
at Main and Franklin Streets, Post Office Box 430, Johnstown,
Pennsylvania 15907-0430, and W. HARRISON VAIL ("Executive").
     WHEREAS, the Executive is the President and Chief Executive
Officer of Three Rivers Bank and Trust Company, ("Three Rivers
Bank"), a Pennsylvania bank and trust company, directly owned by
the Company.
     WHEREAS, the Board of Directors of the Company (the "Board")
has determined that it is in the best interest of the Company and
its shareholders to ensure that the Company and Three Rivers Bank
will have the continued dedication of the Executive,
notwithstanding the possibility, threat or occurrence of a Change
in Control (as defined below) of the Company.  The Board believes
it is imperative to diminish the inevitable distraction of the
Executive by virtue of the personal uncertainties and risks
created by a pending or threatened Change in Control and to
encourage the Executive's full attention and dedication to Three
Rivers Bank currently and in the event of any threatened or
pending Change in Control, and to provide the Executive with
compensation and benefits arrangements upon a Change in Control
which ensure that the compensation and benefits expectations of
the Executive will be satisfied and which are competitive with
those of other corporations.
     NOW THEREFORE, in consideration of the premises and mutual
covenants contained herein, and intending to be legally bound
hereby, the parties hereto agree as follows:

     1.  Term.  This Agreement shall be for a three (3) year
period commencing on the date first set forth above and shall be
automatically renewed on the first and on each subsequent annual
anniversary of the above day and month ("Annual Renewal Date")
for a period ending three (3) years from each Annual Renewal Date
unless either party shall give written notice of non-renewal at
least sixty (60) days prior to the Annual Renewal Date.
     
     2.  Change in Control.  As used in this Agreement, Change in
Control shall mean the occurrence of any of the following:

          (a)  any "person" or "group" (as those terms are
defined or used in Section 13(d) of the Securities Exchange Act
of 1934 (the "Exchange Act"), as enacted and in force on the date
hereof) is or becomes the "beneficial owner" (as that term is
defined in Rule 13d-3 under the Exchange Act, as enacted and in
force on the date hereof) of securities of the Company
representing 24.99% or more of the combined voting power of the
Company's securities then outstanding;

          (b)  there occurs a merger, consolidation, share
exchange, division or other reorganization involving the Company
and another entity in which Company shareholders do 
     not continue to hold a majority of the capital stock of the 
     resulting entity, or a sale, exchange, transfer, or other
                                    -2-
     disposition of substantially all of the assets of the  
Company to another entity or other person; or

          (c)  there occurs a contested proxy solicitation or 
     solicitations of the Company's shareholders which results in
     the contesting party or parties obtaining the ability to
     elect a majority of the members of the Board of Directors
     standing for election at one or more meetings of the
     Company's shareholders.

     3.  Triggering Events.  If a Change in Control shall occur
and if thereafter, at any time during the term of this Agreement
there shall be:
          (a)  any involuntary termination of the Executive by 
     Three Rivers Bank, other than for Cause as defined in
     Section 4 below;
          (b)  any reduction in the Executive's title,
responsibilities, including reporting responsibilities, or
authority, including such title, responsibilities, or authority
as such may be increased from time to time during the term of
this Agreement;
          (c)  the assignment to the Executive of duties
inconsistent with the Executive's office as such duties existed
on the day immediately prior to the date of a Change in Control;
          (d)  any reduction in the Executive's annual base 
     salary in effect on the day immediately prior to the date of
     a Change in Control;
                                    -3-
          (e)  any failure to continue the Executive's 
participation, on substantially similar terms, in any incentive
compensation or bonus plans of Three Rivers Bank in which the
Executive participated in immediately prior to the Change in
Control, or any change or amendment to any of the substantive
provisions of any of such plans which would materially decrease
the potential benefits to the Executive under any of such plans;
          (f)  any failure to provide the Executive with benefits
     at least as favorable as those enjoyed by the Executive
     under any pension, life insurance, medical, health and
     accident, disability or other employee plans of Three Rivers
     Bank in which the Executive participated in immediately
     prior to the time of the Change in Control, or the taking of
     any action that would materially reduce any of such benefits
     in effect at the time of the Change in Control, unless such
     reduction relates to a reduction in benefits applicable to
     all employees generally; or
          (g)  any breach of any provision of this Agreement by   
     the Company or Three Rivers Bank, which breach shall not
     have been cured by the Company or Three Rivers Bank within
     thirty (30) days of the Company's receipt from the Executive
     or his agent of written notice specifying in reasonable
     detail the nature of the Company's or Three Rivers Bank's
     breach;
                                    -4-
then Executive, at his sole discretion, may upon no less than 
ninety (90) days written notice to Company, resign from
employment with Three Rivers Bank (or, if involuntarily
terminated, give notice of intention to collect benefits under
this Agreement) by delivering written notice to the Company at
any time during the term of this Agreement.

     4.  Termination of Executive for Cause.  Upon or following a
Change in Control, the Company or Three Rivers Bank shall have
the right at any time to terminate the Executive's employment for
Cause.  In such event, the Company shall give prompt notice to
the Executive, specifying in reasonable detail the basis for such
termination.  For purposes of this Agreement, "Cause" shall mean
the following conduct of the Executive:
          (a)  Material breach of any provision of this
Agreement, which breach Executive shall have failed to cure
within thirty (30) days after Employee's receipt of written
notice from the Company specifying the specific nature of the
Executive's breach;
          (b)  Willful misconduct of Executive that is materially
     inimical to the best interests, monetary or otherwise, of
     the Company or Three Rivers Bank;
          (c)  Conviction of a felony or of any crime involving 
     moral turpitude, fraud or deceit;
          (d)  Adjudication as a bankrupt under the United States
     Bankruptcy Code.
                                    -5-
     5.  Compensation and Benefits.  Upon the occurrence of an
event set forth in Section 3 hereof and the delivery of a notice
of termination to the Company pursuant to Section 3 hereof, the
Executive shall be absolutely entitled to receive the
compensation and benefits set forth below:
          (a)  the Executive shall select, in his absolute
discretion, and receive either (i) monthly installments equal to
one thirty-sixth (1/36) of an amount equal to 2.99 times the
following:  (x) During the initial three-year term of this
Agreement (the "Initial Term") commencing on the date hereof, the
highest combined base salary and bonus paid or payable to the
Executive in the then current year or in any one of the last five
fiscal years preceding the Executive's delivery of a notice of
termination; or (y) After the expiration of the Initial Term, the
quotient obtained by dividing the sum of the Executive's combined
salary and bonuses in the five years preceding the Executive's
delivery of a notice of termination by five, such monthly
installments shall be payable for a period of one year (the
"Payment Period") commencing on the first day of the first
calendar month after Executive's delivery of notice of
termination, or (ii) a one time lump sum payment equal to the
non-discounted sum of the twelve (12) monthly payments provided
for in Section 5(a)(i) immediately above;
          (b)  from the date of the notice of termination through
     and including the last day of the Payment Period, the 
                                    -6-
     Executive shall be entitled to continue to participate in
     the employee retirement plan(s) of the Company and any
     supplemental executive retirement plan(s) (including
deferred profit sharing plan) or other plan in effect during the
term of this Agreement designed to supplement payments made under
such employee retirement plan, as the case may be, as if the
Executive's employment had not terminated;
          (c)  from the date of the notice of termination through
     and including the last day of the Payment Period, the
     Executive shall be provided with life, disability, and
     medical insurance benefits at levels equivalent to the
     highest levels in effect for the Executive during any one of
     the three (3) calendar years preceding the year in which the
     notice of termination is delivered; and
          (d)  on the date of the notice of termination, all 
     options held by the Executive to acquire common stock of the
     Company, to the extent not immediately exercisable by their
     terms, shall become immediately exercisable, and such
     options shall be exercisable by the Executive at any time
     prior to the earlier of the expiration date(s) of such stock
     options or the date which is ninety (90) days after the
     Executive's termination of employment with the Company.
     In the event the Executive is ineligible to continue
participation in the employee retirement plan of Three Rivers
Bank and/or any supplemental executive retirement plan (including
deferred profit sharing plan) or other plan in effect during the 
                                    -7-
term of this Agreement designed to supplement payments made under
such employee retirement plan or in any of Three Rivers Bank's 
life, disability or medical insurance plans or programs, the
Company shall, in lieu of such participation, pay the Executive a
dollar amount equal to the dollar amount of the benefit forfeited
by the Executive as a result of such ineligibility or a dollar
amount equal to the cost to the Executive to obtain such benefits
in the case of any life, disability or medical insurance plans or
programs.

     6.  Beneficiary.  Should the Executive die after entitlement
but prior to payment in full of amounts due pursuant to Section
5(a)(i) hereof, such monthly payments shall continue (if such
payment option was so elected by Executive) to the Executive's
designated beneficiary or his estate until such entitlement has
been paid in full.

     7.  Employment at Will.  This Agreement contains the entire
understanding of the Company and the Executive with respect to
the subject matter hereof and, subject to the provisions of any
other agreement between the Executive and the Company, the
Executive shall remain an employee at will and nothing herein
shall confer upon the Executive any right to continued employment
and shall not affect the right of Three Rivers Bank to terminate
the Executive for any reason not prohibited by law; provided,
however, that any such removal shall be without prejudice to any
rights the Executive may have to compensation and benefits as 
provided for in Section 5 hereof.
                                    -8-
     8.  Arbitration.  Except as otherwise provided herein, in
the event of any controversy, dispute or claim arising out of, or
relating to this Agreement, or the breach thereof, the parties
may seek recourse only for temporary or preliminary injunctive
relief to the courts having jurisdiction thereof.  If any relief
other than injunctive relief is sought, the Company and the
Executive agree that such underlying controversy, dispute or
claim shall be settled by arbitration conducted in Pittsburgh,
Pennsylvania in accordance with this Section 8 and the Commercial
Arbitration Rules of the American Arbitration Association
("AAA").  The matter shall be heard and decided, and awards
rendered, by a panel of three (3) arbitrators (the "Arbitration
Panel").  The Company and Executive shall each select one
arbitrator from the AAA National Panel of Commercial Arbitrators
(the "Commercial Panel") and AAA shall select a third arbitrator
from the Commercial Panel.  The award rendered by the Arbitration
Panel shall be final and binding as between the parties hereto
and their heirs, executors, administrators, successors and
assigns, and judgment on the award may be entered by any court
having jurisdiction thereof.  Each party shall pay their
professional fees, expenses and costs incurred in connection with
the resolution of any controversy, dispute or claim arising out
of, or relating to this Agreement.

     9.  Assignment.  This Agreement shall be binding upon and
inure to the benefit of the successors and assigns of the
Company, and the Company shall require any successor to expressly
                                    -9-
acknowledge and assume its obligation hereunder.  This Agreement
shall be void and no further force and effect upon the Company's
sale of all the voting stock or assets of Three Rivers Bank to an
unrelated third party or to combine with another Company
affiliate, except if it is reasonably demonstrated such sale was
at the request of a third party who has taken steps reasonably
calculated to effect a Change in Control or such sale otherwise
arose in connection with or in anticipation of a Change in
Control.  This Agreement shall inure to the extent provided
hereunder to the benefit of and be enforceable by the Executive
or his/her legal representatives, executors, administrators,
successors, heirs, distributees, devisees and legatees.  The
Executive may not delegate any of his/her duties,
responsibilities, obligations or positions hereunder to any
person and any such purported delegation by him/her shall be void
and of no force and effect.

     10.  Prior Termination.  Anything in this Agreement to the
contrary notwithstanding, if the Executive's employment with
Three Rivers Bank is terminated prior to the date on which a
Change in Control occurs either (a) by the Company or Three
Rivers Bank other than for Cause or (b) by the Executive for any
one of the reasons set forth in Section 3 hereof, and it is
reasonably demonstrated that such termination of employment (i)
was at the request of a third party who has taken steps
reasonably calculated to effect the Change in Control or (ii)
otherwise arose in connection with or anticipation of the Change 
                                   -10-
in Control, then for all purposes of this Agreement the
termination shall deemed to have occurred upon a Change in
Control and the Executive will be entitled to the 
compensation and benefits provided for in Section 5 hereof.

     11.  Release.  The Executive hereby acknowledges and agrees
that prior to the occurrence of the Executive's or his
dependent's right to receive from the Company or any of its
representatives or agents any compensation or benefit to be paid
or provided to him or his dependents pursuant to Section 5 of
this Agreement, the Executive may be required by the Company, in
its sole discretion, to execute a release in a form reasonably
acceptable to the Company, which releases any and all claims the
Executive has or may have against the Company or its
subsidiaries, agents, officers, directors, successors or assigns.

     12.  Compliance with Laws.  The parties hereto acknowledge
and agree that this Agreement and each party's enforcement of
their rights hereunder are subject to the Comprehensive Thrift
and Bank Fraud Prosecutions Act of 1990 (12 USC 1828) as enacted
and in force on the date hereof.

     13.  Notice.  Any notice required or permitted to be given
under this Agreement shall be sufficient if in writing, and if
personally delivered or when sent by first class certified or
registered mail, postage prepaid, return receipt requested -- in
the case of the Executive, to his residence address as set forth
below, and in the case of the Company, to the address of its 
                                   -11-
principal place of business, in care of the Board -- or to such
other person or at such other address with respect to each party
as such party shall notify the other in writing.

     This Agreement supersedes the Agreement between Executive 
and Three Rivers Bank dated June 23, 1988.

     IN WITNESS WHEREOF, the parties have executed this Agreement
as of the date first above written.

imperative to diminish the inevitable distraction of the
Executive by virtue of the personal uncertainties and risks
created by a pending or threatened Change in Control and to
encourage the Executive's full attention and dedication to
U. S. Bank currently and in the event of any threatened or
pending Change in Control, and to provide the Executive with

covenants contained herein, and intending to be legally bound
hereby, the parties hereto agree as follows:

defined or used in Section 13(d) of the Securities          
Exchange Act of 1934 (the "Exchange Act"), as enacted and
in force on the date hereof) is or becomes the

securities then outstanding;

          (b)  there occurs a merger, consolidation, share  
     exchange, division or other reorganization involving   
     the Company and another entity in which Company        
     shareholders do not continue to hold a majority of the 
     capital stock of the resulting entity, or a sale, 
     exchange, transfer, or other
                                    -2-
     disposition of substantially all of the assets of the  
     Company to another entity or other person; or

          (c)  there occurs a contested proxy solicitation or 
     solicitations of the Company's shareholders which      
     results in the contesting party or parties obtaining the 
     ability to elect a majority of the members of the Board of 
     Directors standing for election at one or more meetings of 
     the Company's shareholders.

     3.  Triggering Events.  If a Change in Control shall occur

as such may be increased from time to time during the term

Control, or any change or amendment to any of the      
substantive provisions of any of such plans which would     
materially decrease the potential benefits to the Executive 
     under any of such plans;

     the time of the Change in Control, or the taking of any
     action that would materially reduce any of such benefits in
     effect at the time of the Change in Control, unless such

     all employees generally; or
          (g)  any breach of any provision of this Agreement by   
     the Company or U. S. Bank, which breach shall not have been

     then Executive, at his sole discretion, may upon no less 
     than ninety (90) days written notice to Company, resign from
     employment with U. S. Bank (or, if involuntarily terminated,
     give notice of intention to collect benefits under this 
     Agreement) by delivering written notice to the Company at 
     any time during the term of this Agreement.

     4.  Termination of Executive for Cause.  Upon or following a

the Executive in the then current year or in any one of the
last five fiscal years preceding the Executive's delivery of a
notice of termination; or (y) After the expiration of the
Initial Term, the quotient obtained by dividing the sum of the
Executive's combined salary and bonuses in the five years
preceding the Executive's delivery of a notice of termination by
five, such monthly installments shall be payable for a period
of one year (the "Payment Period") commencing on the first day 
of the first calendar month after Executive's delivery of 
notice of termination, or (ii) a one time lump sum payment 
equal to the non-discounted sum of the twelve (12) monthly 
payments provided for in Section 5(a)(i) immediately above;
          (b)  from the date of the notice of termination through
     and including the last day of the Payment Period, the 
                                    -6-
     Executive shall be entitled to continue to participate in
     the employee retirement plan(s) of the Company and any
     supplemental executive retirement plan(s) (including   
deferred profit sharing plan) or other plan in effect during 
     the term of this Agreement designed to supplement payments 
     made under such employee retirement plan, as the case may 
     be, as if the Executive's employment had not terminated;
          (c)  from the date of the notice of termination through
     and including the last day of the Payment Period, the
     Executive shall be provided with life, disability, and
     medical insurance benefits at levels equivalent to the
     highest levels in effect for the Executive during any one of
     the three (3) calendar years preceding the year in which the
     notice of termination is delivered; and
          (d)  on the date of the notice of termination, all 
     options held by the Executive to acquire common stock of the
     Company, to the extent not immediately exercisable by their
     terms, shall become immediately exercisable, and such
     options shall be exercisable by the Executive at any time
     prior to the earlier of the expiration date(s) of such stock
     options or the date which is ninety (90) days after the
     Executive's termination of employment with the Company.
     In the event the Executive is ineligible to continue   
participation in the employee retirement plan of U. S. Bank 
     and/or any supplemental executive retirement plan (including
     deferred profit sharing plan) or other plan in effect during
     the                            -7-
     term of this Agreement designed to supplement payments made 
     under such employee retirement plan or in any of U. S. 
     Bank's life, disability or medical insurance plans or  
programs, the Company shall, in lieu of such participation, 
     pay the Executive a dollar amount equal to the dollar amount
     of the benefit forfeited by the Executive as a result of 
     such ineligibility or a dollar amount equal to the cost to 
     the Executive to obtain such benefits in the case of any 
     life, disability or medical insurance plans or programs.

     6.  Beneficiary.  Should the Executive die after entitlement
but prior to payment in full of amounts due pursuant to Section
5(a)(i) hereof, such monthly payments shall continue (if such
payment option was so elected by Executive) to the Executive's
designated beneficiary or his estate until such entitlement has
been paid in full.

     7.  Employment at Will.  This Agreement contains the entire
understanding of the Company and the Executive with respect to
the subject matter hereof and, subject to the provisions of any
other agreement between the Executive and the Company, the
Executive shall remain an employee at will and nothing herein
shall confer upon the Executive any right to continued employment
and shall not affect the right of U. S. Bank to terminate the
Executive for any reason not prohibited by law; provided,
however, that any such removal shall be without prejudice to any
rights the Executive may have to compensation and benefits as 
provided for in Section 5 hereof.
                                    -8-
     8.  Arbitration.  Except as otherwise provided herein, in
the event of any controversy, dispute or claim arising out of, or
relating to this Agreement, or the breach thereof, the parties
may seek recourse only for temporary or preliminary injunctive
relief to the courts having jurisdiction thereof.  If any relief
other than injunctive relief is sought, the Company and the
Executive agree that such underlying controversy, dispute or
claim shall be settled by arbitration conducted in Pittsburgh,
Pennsylvania in accordance with this Section 8 and the Commercial
Arbitration Rules of the American Arbitration Association
("AAA").  The matter shall be heard and decided, and awards
rendered, by a panel of three (3) arbitrators (the "Arbitration
Panel").  The Company and Executive shall each select one
arbitrator from the AAA National Panel of Commercial Arbitrators
(the "Commercial Panel") and AAA shall select a third arbitrator
from the Commercial Panel.  The award rendered by the Arbitration
Panel shall be final and binding as between the parties hereto
and their heirs, executors, administrators, successors and
assigns, and judgment on the award may be entered by any court
having jurisdiction thereof.  Each party shall pay their
professional fees, expenses and costs incurred in connection with
the resolution of any controversy, dispute or claim arising out
of, or relating to this Agreement.

     9.  Assignment.  This Agreement shall be binding upon and
inure to the benefit of the successors and assigns of the
Company, and the Company shall require any successor to expressly
                                    -9-
acknowledge and assume its obligation hereunder.  This Agreement
shall be void and no further force and effect upon the Company's
sale of all the voting stock or assets of U. S. Bank to an
unrelated third party or to combine with another Company
affiliate, except if it is reasonably demonstrated such sale was
at the request of a third party who has taken steps reasonably
calculated to effect a Change in Control or such sale otherwise
arose in connection with or in anticipation of a Change in
Control.  This Agreement shall inure to the extent provided
hereunder to the benefit of and be enforceable by the Executive
or his/her legal representatives, executors, administrators,
successors, heirs, distributees, devisees and legatees.  The
Executive may not delegate any of his/her duties,
responsibilities, obligations or positions hereunder to any
person and any such purported delegation by him/her shall be void
and of no force and effect.

     10.  Prior Termination.  Anything in this Agreement to the
contrary notwithstanding, if the Executive's employment with 
U. S. Bank is terminated prior to the date on which a Change in
Control occurs either (a) by the Company or U. S. Bank other than
for Cause or (b) by the Executive for any one of the reasons set
forth in Section 3 hereof, and it is reasonably demonstrated that
such termination of employment (i) was at the request of a third
party who has taken steps reasonably calculated to effect the
Change in Control or (ii) otherwise arose in connection with or 
                                   -10-
anticipation of the Change in Control, then for all purposes of
this Agreement the termination shall deemed to have occurred upon
a Change in Control and the Executive will be entitled to the 
compensation and benefits provided for in Section 5 hereof.

     11.  Release.  The Executive hereby acknowledges and agrees
that prior to the occurrence of the Executive's or his
dependent's right to receive from the Company or any of its
representatives or agents any compensation or benefit to be paid
or provided to him or his dependents pursuant to Section 5 of
this Agreement, the Executive may be required by the Company, in
its sole discretion, to execute a release in a form reasonably
acceptable to the Company, which releases any and all claims the
Executive has or may have against the Company or its
subsidiaries, agents, officers, directors, successors or assigns.

     12.  Compliance with Laws.  The parties hereto acknowledge
and agree that this Agreement and each party's enforcement of
their rights hereunder are subject to the Comprehensive Thrift
and Bank Fraud Prosecutions Act of 1990 (12 USC 1828) as enacted
and in force on the date hereof.

     13.  Notice.  Any notice required or permitted to be given
under this Agreement shall be sufficient if in writing, and if
personally delivered or when sent by first class certified or
registered mail, postage prepaid, return receipt requested -- in
the case of the Executive, to his residence address as set forth
below, and in the case of the Company, to the address of its 
                                   -11-
principal place of business, in care of the Board -- or to such
other person or at such other address with respect to each party
as such party shall notify the other in writing.
     
     IN WITNESS WHEREOF, the parties have executed this Agreement
as of the date first above written.

EXHIBIT 10.5
                                 AGREEMENT

     This Agreement (the "Agreement") made the 25th day of
October, 1994, by and between USBANCORP, Inc. (the "Company"), a
Pennsylvania corporation, having its principal place of business
at Main and Franklin Streets, Post Office Box 430, Johnstown,
Pennsylvania 15907-0430, and DENNIS J. FANTASKI
("Executive").
     WHEREAS, the Executive is the President and Chief Executive
Officer of Community Savings Bank, ("Community"), a Pennsylvania-
chartered savings bank, indirectly owned by the Company.
     WHEREAS, the Board of Directors of the Company (the "Board")
has determined that it is in the best interest of the Company and
its shareholders to ensure that the Company and Community will
have the continued dedication of the Executive, notwithstanding
the possibility, threat or occurrence of a Change in Control (as
defined below) of the Company.  The Board believes it is
imperative to diminish the inevitable distraction of the
Executive by virtue of the personal uncertainties and risks
created by a pending or threatened Change in Control and to
encourage the Executive's full attention and dedication to
Community currently and in the event of any threatened or pending
Change in Control, and to provide the Executive with compensation
and benefits arrangements upon a Change in Control which ensure
that the compensation and benefits expectations of the Executive
will be satisfied and which are competitive with those of other
corporations.

     NOW THEREFORE, in consideration of the premises and mutual
covenants contained herein, and intending to be legally bound
hereby, the parties hereto agree as follows:

     1.  Term.  This Agreement shall be for a three (3) year
period commencing on the date first set forth above and shall be
automatically renewed on the first and on each subsequent annual
anniversary of the above day and month ("Annual Renewal Date")
for a period ending three (3) years from each Annual Renewal Date
unless either party shall give written notice of non-renewal at
least sixty (60) days prior to the Annual Renewal Date.
     
     2.  Change in Control.  As used in this Agreement, Change in
Control shall mean the occurrence of any of the following:

          (a)  any "person" or "group" (as those terms are
defined or used in Section 13(d) of the Securities Exchange Act
of 1934 (the "Exchange Act"), as enacted and in force on the date
hereof) is or becomes the "beneficial owner" (as that term is
defined in Rule 13d-3 under the Exchange Act, as enacted and in
force on the date hereof) of securities of the Company
representing 24.99% or more of the combined voting power of the
Company's securities then outstanding;

          (b)  there occurs a merger, consolidation, share
exchange, division or other reorganization involving the Company
and another entity in which Company shareholders do 
     not continue to hold a majority of the capital stock of the 
     resulting entity, or a sale, exchange, transfer, or other
                                    -2-
     disposition of substantially all of the assets of the  
Company to another entity or other person; or

          (c)  there occurs a contested proxy solicitation or 
     solicitations of the Company's shareholders which results in
     the contesting party or parties obtaining the ability to
     elect a majority of the members of the Board of Directors
     standing for election at one or more meetings of the
     Company's shareholders.

     3.  Triggering Events.  If a Change in Control shall occur
and if thereafter, at any time during the term of this Agreement
there shall be:
          (a)  any involuntary termination of the Executive by 
     Community, other than for Cause as defined in Section 4
     below;
          (b)  any reduction in the Executive's title,
responsibilities, including reporting responsibilities, or
authority, including such title, responsibilities, or authority
as such may be increased from time to time during the term of
this Agreement;
          (c)  the assignment to the Executive of duties
inconsistent with the Executive's office as such duties existed
on the day immediately prior to the date of a Change in Control;
          (d)  any reduction in the Executive's annual base 
     salary in effect on the day immediately prior to the date of
     a Change in Control;
                                    -3-
          (e)  any failure to continue the Executive's 
participation, on substantially similar terms, in any incentive
compensation or bonus plans of Community in which the Executive
participated in immediately prior to the Change in Control, or
any change or amendment to any of the substantive provisions of
any of such plans which would materially decrease the potential
benefits to the Executive under any of such plans;
          (f)  any failure to provide the Executive with benefits
     at least as favorable as those enjoyed by the Executive
     under any pension, life insurance, medical, health and
     accident, disability or other employee plans of Community in
     which the Executive participated in immediately prior to the
     time of the Change in Control, or the taking of any action
     that would materially reduce any of such benefits in effect
     at the time of the Change in Control, unless such reduction
     relates to a reduction in benefits applicable to all
     employees generally; or
          (g)  any breach of any provision of this Agreement by   
     the Company or Community, which breach shall not have been
     cured by the Company or Community within thirty (30) days of
     the Company's receipt from the Executive or his agent of
     written notice specifying in reasonable detail the nature of
     the Company's or Community's breach;
                                    -4-
then Executive, at his sole discretion, may upon no less than 
ninety (90) days written notice to Company, resign from
employment with Community (or, if involuntarily terminated, give
notice of intention to collect benefits under this Agreement) by
delivering written notice to the Company at any time during the
term of this Agreement.

     4.  Termination of Executive for Cause.  Upon or following a
Change in Control, the Company or Community shall have the right
at any time to terminate the Executive's employment for Cause. 
In such event, the Company shall give prompt notice to the
Executive, specifying in reasonable detail the basis for such
termination.  For purposes of this Agreement, "Cause" shall mean
the following conduct of the Executive:
          (a)  Material breach of any provision of this
Agreement, which breach Executive shall have failed to cure
within thirty (30) days after Employee's receipt of written
notice from the Company specifying the specific nature of the
Executive's breach;
          (b)  Willful misconduct of Executive that is materially
     inimical to the best interests, monetary or otherwise, of
     the Company or Community;
          (c)  Conviction of a felony or of any crime involving 
     moral turpitude, fraud or deceit;
          (d)  Adjudication as a bankrupt under the United States
     Bankruptcy Code.
                                    -5-
     5.  Compensation and Benefits.  Upon the occurrence of an
event set forth in Section 3 hereof and the delivery of a notice
of termination to the Company pursuant to Section 3 hereof, the
Executive shall be absolutely entitled to receive the
compensation and benefits set forth below:
          (a)  the Executive shall select, in his absolute
discretion, and receive either (i) monthly installments equal to
one thirty-sixth (1/36) of an amount equal to 2.99 times the
following:  (x) During the initial three-year term of this
Agreement (the "Initial Term") commencing on the date hereof, the
highest combined base salary and bonus paid or payable to the
Executive in the then current year or in any one of the last five
fiscal years preceding the Executive's delivery of a notice of
termination; or (y) After the expiration of the Initial Term, the
quotient obtained by dividing the sum of the Executive's combined
salary and bonuses in the five years preceding the Executive's
delivery of a notice of termination by five, such monthly
installments shall be payable for a period of one year (the
"Payment Period") commencing on the first day of the first
calendar month after Executive's delivery of notice of
termination, or (ii) a one time lump sum payment equal to the
non-discounted sum of the twelve (12) monthly payments provided
for in Section 5(a)(i) immediately above;
          (b)  from the date of the notice of termination through
     and including the last day of the Payment Period, the 
                                    -6-
     Executive shall be entitled to continue to participate in
     the employee retirement plan(s) of the Company and any
     supplemental executive retirement plan(s) (including
deferred profit sharing plan) or other plan in effect during the
term of this Agreement designed to supplement payments made under
such employee retirement plan, as the case may be, as if the
Executive's employment had not terminated;
          (c)  from the date of the notice of termination through
     and including the last day of the Payment Period, the
     Executive shall be provided with life, disability, and
     medical insurance benefits at levels equivalent to the
     highest levels in effect for the Executive during any one of
     the three (3) calendar years preceding the year in which the
     notice of termination is delivered; and
          (d)  on the date of the notice of termination, all 
     options held by the Executive to acquire common stock of the
     Company, to the extent not immediately exercisable by their
     terms, shall become immediately exercisable, and such
     options shall be exercisable by the Executive at any time
     prior to the earlier of the expiration date(s) of such stock
     options or the date which is ninety (90) days after the
     Executive's termination of employment with the Company.
     In the event the Executive is ineligible to continue
participation in the employee retirement plan of Community and/or
any supplemental executive retirement plan (including deferred
profit sharing plan) or other plan in effect during the
                                    -7-
term of this Agreement designed to supplement payments made under
such employee retirement plan or in any of Community's 
life, disability or medical insurance plans or programs, the
Company shall, in lieu of such participation, pay the Executive a
dollar amount equal to the dollar amount of the benefit forfeited
by the Executive as a result of such ineligibility or a dollar
amount equal to the cost to the Executive to obtain such benefits
in the case of any life, disability or medical insurance plans or
programs.

     6.  Beneficiary.  Should the Executive die after entitlement
but prior to payment in full of amounts due pursuant to Section
5(a)(i) hereof, such monthly payments shall continue (if such
payment option was so elected by Executive) to the Executive's
designated beneficiary or his estate until such entitlement has
been paid in full.

     7.  Employment at Will.  This Agreement contains the entire
understanding of the Company and the Executive with respect to
the subject matter hereof and, subject to the provisions of any
other agreement between the Executive and the Company, the
Executive shall remain an employee at will and nothing herein
shall confer upon the Executive any right to continued employment
and shall not affect the right of Community to terminate the
Executive for any reason not prohibited by law; provided,
however, that any such removal shall be without prejudice to any
rights the Executive may have to compensation and benefits as 
provided for in Section 5 hereof.
                                    -8-
     8.  Arbitration.  Except as otherwise provided herein, in
the event of any controversy, dispute or claim arising out of, or
relating to this Agreement, or the breach thereof, the parties
may seek recourse only for temporary or preliminary injunctive
relief to the courts having jurisdiction thereof.  If any relief
other than injunctive relief is sought, the Company and the
Executive agree that such underlying controversy, dispute or
claim shall be settled by arbitration conducted in Pittsburgh,
Pennsylvania in accordance with this Section 8 and the Commercial
Arbitration Rules of the American Arbitration Association
("AAA").  The matter shall be heard and decided, and awards
rendered, by a panel of three (3) arbitrators (the "Arbitration
Panel").  The Company and Executive shall each select one
arbitrator from the AAA National Panel of Commercial Arbitrators
(the "Commercial Panel") and AAA shall select a third arbitrator
from the Commercial Panel.  The award rendered by the Arbitration
Panel shall be final and binding as between the parties hereto
and their heirs, executors, administrators, successors and
assigns, and judgment on the award may be entered by any court
having jurisdiction thereof.  Each party shall pay their
professional fees, expenses and costs incurred in connection with
the resolution of any controversy, dispute or claim arising out
of, or relating to this Agreement.

     9.  Assignment.  This Agreement shall be binding upon and
inure to the benefit of the successors and assigns of the
Company, and the Company shall require any successor to expressly
                                    -9-
acknowledge and assume its obligation hereunder.  This Agreement
shall be void and no further force and effect upon the Company's
sale of all the voting stock or assets of Community to an
unrelated third party or to combine with another Company
affiliate, except if it is reasonably demonstrated such sale was
at the request of a third party who has taken steps reasonably
calculated to effect a Change in Control or such sale otherwise
arose in connection with or in anticipation of a Change in
Control.  This Agreement shall inure to the extent provided
hereunder to the benefit of and be enforceable by the Executive
or his/her legal representatives, executors, administrators,
successors, heirs, distributees, devisees and legatees.  The
Executive may not delegate any of his/her duties,
responsibilities, obligations or positions hereunder to any
person and any such purported delegation by him/her shall be void
and of no force and effect.

     10.  Prior Termination.  Anything in this Agreement to the
contrary notwithstanding, if the Executive's employment with 
Community is terminated prior to the date on which a Change in
Control occurs either (a) by the Company or Community other than
for Cause or (b) by the Executive for any one of the reasons set
forth in Section 3 hereof, and it is reasonably demonstrated that
such termination of employment (i) was at the request of a third
party who has taken steps reasonably calculated to effect the
Change in Control or (ii) otherwise arose in connection with or 
                                   -10-
anticipation of the Change in Control, then for all purposes of
this Agreement the termination shall deemed to have occurred upon
a Change in Control and the Executive will be entitled to the 
compensation and benefits provided for in Section 5 hereof.

     11.  Release.  The Executive hereby acknowledges and agrees
that prior to the occurrence of the Executive's or his
dependent's right to receive from the Company or any of its
representatives or agents any compensation or benefit to be paid
or provided to him or his dependents pursuant to Section 5 of
this Agreement, the Executive may be required by the Company, in
its sole discretion, to execute a release in a form reasonably
acceptable to the Company, which releases any and all claims the
Executive has or may have against the Company or its
subsidiaries, agents, officers, directors, successors or assigns.

     12.  Compliance with Laws.  The parties hereto acknowledge
and agree that this Agreement and each party's enforcement of
their rights hereunder are subject to the Comprehensive Thrift
and Bank Fraud Prosecutions Act of 1990 (12 USC 1828) as enacted
and in force on the date hereof.

     13.  Notice.  Any notice required or permitted to be given
under this Agreement shall be sufficient if in writing, and if
personally delivered or when sent by first class certified or
registered mail, postage prepaid, return receipt requested -- in
the case of the Executive, to his residence address as set forth
below, and in the case of the Company, to the address of its

principal place of business, in care of the Board -- or to such
other person or at such other address with respect to each party
as such party shall notify the other in writing.
     
     IN WITNESS WHEREOF, the parties have executed this Agreement
as of the date first above written.

EXHIBIT 10.8
                                 AGREEMENT

     This Agreement (the "Agreement") made the 25th day of
October, 1994, by and between USBANCORP, Inc. (the "Company"), a
Pennsylvania corporation, having its principal place of business
at Main and Franklin Streets, Post Office Box 430, Johnstown,
Pennsylvania 15907-0430, and ORLANDO B. HANSELMAN  ("Executive").
     WHEREAS, the Executive is the Executive Vice President,
Chief Financial Officer and Manager of Corporate Services of the
Company.
     WHEREAS, the Board of Directors of the Company (the "Board")
has determined that it is in the best interest of the Company and
its shareholders to ensure that the Company will have the
continued dedication of the Executive, notwithstanding the
possibility, threat or occurrence of a Change in Control (as
defined below) of the Company.  The Board believes it is
imperative to diminish the inevitable distraction of the
Executive by virtue of the personal uncertainties and risks
created by a pending or threatened Change in Control and to
encourage the Executive's full attention and dedication to the
Company currently and in the event of any threatened or pending
Change in Control, and to provide the Executive with compensation
and benefits arrangements upon a Change in Control which ensure
that the compensation and benefits expectations of the Executive
will be satisfied and which are competitive with those of other
corporations.

     NOW THEREFORE, in consideration of the premises and mutual
covenants contained herein, and intending to be legally bound
hereby, the parties hereto agree as follows:
     
     1.  Term.  This Agreement shall be for a three (3) year
period commencing on the date first set forth above and shall be
automatically renewed on the first and on each subsequent annual
anniversary of the above day and month ("Annual Renewal Date")
for a period ending three (3) years from each Annual Renewal Date
unless either party shall give written notice of non-renewal at
least sixty (60) days prior to the Annual Renewal Date.
     
     2.  Change in Control.  As used in this Agreement, Change in
Control shall mean the occurrence of any of the following:

          (a)  any "person" or "group" (as those terms are
defined or used in Section 13(d) of the Securities Exchange Act
of 1934 (the "Exchange Act"), as enacted and in force on the date
hereof) is or becomes the "beneficial owner" (as that term is
defined in Rule 13d-3 under the Exchange Act, as enacted and in
force on the date hereof) of securities of the Company
representing 24.99% or more of the combined voting power of the
Company's securities then outstanding;

          (b)  there occurs a merger, consolidation, share
exchange, division or other reorganization involving the Company
and another entity in which Company shareholders do not continue
to hold a majority of the capital stock of the resulting entity,
or a sale, exchange, transfer, or other
                                    -2-
     disposition of substantially all of the assets of the  
     Company to another entity or other person; or

          (c)  there occurs a contested proxy solicitation or 
     solicitations of the Company's shareholders which results in
     the contesting party or parties obtaining the ability to
     elect a majority of the members of the Board of Directors
     standing for election at one or more meetings of the
     Company's shareholders.

     3.  Triggering Events.  If a Change in Control shall occur
and if thereafter, at any time during the term of this Agreement
there shall be:
          (a)  any involuntary termination of the Executive by 
     the Company, other than for Cause as defined in Section 4
     below;
          (b)  any reduction in the Executive's title,
responsibilities, including reporting responsibilities, or
authority, including such title, responsibilities, or authority
as such may be increased from time to time during the term of
this Agreement;
          (c)  the assignment to the Executive of duties
inconsistent with the Executive's office as such duties existed
on the day immediately prior to the date of a Change in Control;
          (d)  any reduction in the Executive's annual base 
     salary in effect on the day immediately prior to the date of
     a Change in Control;
                                    -3-
          (e)  any failure to continue the Executive's 
participation, on substantially similar terms, in any incentive
compensation or bonus plans of the Company in which the Executive
participated in immediately prior to the Change in Control, or
any change or amendment to any of the substantive provisions of
any of such plans which would materially decrease the potential
benefits to the Executive under any of such plans;
          (f)  any failure to provide the Executive with benefits
     at least as favorable as those enjoyed by the Executive
     under any pension, life insurance, medical, health and
     accident, disability or other employee plans of the Company
     in which the Executive participated in immediately prior to
     the time of the Change in Control, or the taking of any
     action that would materially reduce any of such benefits in
     effect at the time of the Change in Control, unless such
     reduction relates to a reduction in benefits applicable to
     all employees generally; or
          (g)  any breach of any provision of this Agreement by   
     the Company, which breach shall not have been cured by the
     Company within thirty (30) days of the Company's receipt
     from the Executive or his agent of written notice specifying
     in reasonable detail the nature of the Company's breach;
then Executive, at his sole discretion, may upon no less than 
ninety (90) days written notice to Company, resign from
employment with the Company (or, if involuntarily 
                                    -4-
terminated, give notice of intention to collect benefits under
this Agreement) by delivering written notice to the Company at
any time during the term of this Agreement.

     4.  Termination of Executive for Cause.  Upon or following a
Change in Control, the Company shall have the right at any time
to terminate the Executive's employment for Cause.  In such
event, the Company shall give prompt notice to the Executive,
specifying in reasonable detail the basis for such termination. 
For purposes of this Agreement, "Cause" shall mean the following
conduct of the Executive:
          (a)  Material breach of any provision of this
Agreement, which breach Executive shall have failed to cure
within thirty (30) days after Employee's receipt of written
notice from the Company specifying the specific nature of the
Executive's breach;
          (b)  Willful misconduct of Executive that is materially
     inimical to the best interests, monetary or otherwise, of
     the Company;
          (c)  Conviction of a felony or of any crime involving 
     moral turpitude, fraud or deceit;
          (d)  Adjudication as a bankrupt under the United States
     Bankruptcy Code.

     5.  Compensation and Benefits.  Upon the occurrence of an
event set forth in Section 3 hereof and the delivery of a notice
of termination to the Company pursuant to Section 3 hereof, the 
                                    -5-
Executive shall be absolutely entitled to receive the
compensation and benefits set forth below:
          (a)  the Executive shall select, in his absolute
discretion, and receive either (i) monthly installments equal to
one thirty-sixth (1/36) of an amount equal to 2.99 times the
following:  (x) During the initial three-year term of this
Agreement (the "Initial Term") commencing on the date hereof, the
highest combined base salary and bonus paid or payable to the
Executive in the then current year or in any one of the last five
fiscal years preceding the Executive's delivery of a notice of
termination; or (y) After the expiration of the Initial Term, the
quotient obtained by dividing the sum of the Executive's combined
salary and bonuses in the five years preceding the Executive's
delivery of a notice of termination by five, such monthly
installments shall be payable for a period of one and one half (1
1/2) years (the "Payment Period") commencing on the first day of
the first calendar month after Executive's delivery of notice of
termination, or (ii) a one time lump sum payment equal to the
non-discounted sum of the eighteen (18) monthly payments provided
for in Section 5(a)(i) immediately above;
          (b)  from the date of the notice of termination through
     and including the last day of the Payment Period, the 
     Executive shall be entitled to continue to participate in
     the employee retirement plan(s) of the Company and any
                                    -6-
     supplemental executive retirement plan(s) (including
     deferred profit sharing plan) or other plan in effect during
     the term of this Agreement designed to supplement payments
     made under such employee retirement plan, as the case may
     be, as if the Executive's employment had not terminated;
          (c)  from the date of the notice of termination through
     and including the last day of the Payment Period, the
     Executive shall be provided with life, disability, and
     medical insurance benefits at levels equivalent to the
     highest levels in effect for the Executive during any one of
     the three (3) calendar years preceding the year in which the
     notice of termination is delivered; and
          (d)  on the date of the notice of termination, all 
     options held by the Executive to acquire common stock of the
     Company, to the extent not immediately exercisable by their
     terms, shall become immediately exercisable, and such
     options shall be exercisable by the Executive at any time
     prior to the earlier of the expiration date(s) of such stock
     options or the date which is ninety (90) days after the
     Executive's termination of employment with the Company.
     In the event the Executive is ineligible to continue
participation in the employee retirement plan of the Company
and/or any supplemental executive retirement plan (including
deferred profit sharing plan) or other plan in effect during the 
term of this Agreement designed to supplement payments made under
such employee retirement plan or in any of the Company's 
                                    -7-
life, disability or medical insurance plans or programs, the
Company shall, in lieu of such participation, pay the Executive a
dollar amount equal to the dollar amount of the benefit forfeited
by the Executive as a result of such ineligibility or a dollar
amount equal to the cost to the Executive to obtain such benefits
in the case of any life, disability or medical insurance plans or
programs.

     6.  Beneficiary.  Should the Executive die after entitlement
but prior to payment in full of amounts due pursuant to Section
5(a)(i) hereof, such monthly payments shall continue (if such
payment option was so elected by Executive) to the Executive's
designated beneficiary or his estate until such entitlement has
been paid in full.

     7.  Employment at Will.  This Agreement contains the entire
understanding of the Company and the Executive with respect to
the subject matter hereof and, subject to the provisions of any
other agreement between the Executive and the Company, the
Executive shall remain an employee at will and nothing herein
shall confer upon the Executive any right to continued employment
and shall not affect the right of the Company to terminate the
Executive for any reason not prohibited by law; provided,
however, that any such removal shall be without prejudice to any
rights the Executive may have to compensation and benefits as 
provided for in Section 5 hereof.
                                    -8-
     8.  Arbitration.  Except as otherwise provided herein, in
the event of any controversy, dispute or claim arising out of, or
relating to this Agreement, or the breach thereof, the parties
may seek recourse only for temporary or preliminary injunctive
relief to the courts having jurisdiction thereof.  If any relief
other than injunctive relief is sought, the Company and the
Executive agree that such underlying controversy, dispute or
claim shall be settled by arbitration conducted in Pittsburgh,
Pennsylvania in accordance with this Section 8 and the Commercial
Arbitration Rules of the American Arbitration Association
("AAA").  The matter shall be heard and decided, and awards
rendered, by a panel of three (3) arbitrators (the "Arbitration
Panel").  The Company and Executive shall each select one
arbitrator from the AAA National Panel of Commercial Arbitrators
(the "Commercial Panel") and AAA shall select a third arbitrator
from the Commercial Panel.  The award rendered by the Arbitration
Panel shall be final and binding as between the parties hereto
and their heirs, executors, administrators, successors and
assigns, and judgment on the award may be entered by any court
having jurisdiction thereof.  Each party shall pay their
professional fees, expenses and costs incurred in connection with
the resolution of any controversy, dispute or claim arising out
of, or relating to this Agreement.

     9.  Assignment.  This Agreement shall be binding upon and
inure to the benefit of the successors and assigns of the
Company, and the Company shall require any successor to expressly
                                    -9-
acknowledge and assume its obligation hereunder.  This Agreement
shall inure to the extent provided hereunder to the benefit of
and be enforceable by the Executive or his/her legal
representatives, executors, administrators, successors, heirs,
distributees, devisees and legatees.  The Executive may not
delegate any of his/her duties, responsibilities, obligations or
positions hereunder to any person and any such purported
delegation by him/her shall be void and of no force and effect.

     10.  Prior Termination.  Anything in this Agreement to the
contrary notwithstanding, if the Executive's employment with the
Company is terminated prior to the date on which a Change in
Control occurs either (a) by the Company other than for Cause or
(b) by the Executive for any one of the reasons set forth in
Section 3 hereof, and it is reasonably demonstrated that such
termination of employment (i) was at the request of a third party
who has taken steps reasonably calculated to effect the Change in
Control or (ii) otherwise arose in connection with or
anticipation of the Change in Control, then for all purposes of
this Agreement the termination shall deemed to have occurred upon
a Change in Control and the Executive will be entitled to the 
compensation and benefits provided for in Section 5 hereof.

     11.  Release.  The Executive hereby acknowledges and agrees
that prior to the occurrence of the Executive's or his
dependent's right to receive from the Company or any of its 
representatives or agents any compensation or benefit to be paid 
                                   -10-
or provided to him or his dependents pursuant to Section 5 of
this Agreement, the Executive may be required by the Company, in
its sole discretion, to execute a release in a form reasonably
acceptable to the Company, which releases any and all claims the
Executive has or may have against the Company or its
subsidiaries, agents, officers, directors, successors or assigns.

     12.  Compliance with Laws.  The parties hereto acknowledge
and agree that this Agreement and each party's enforcement of
their rights hereunder are subject to the Comprehensive Thrift
and Bank Fraud Prosecutions Act of 1990 (12 USC 1828) as enacted
and in force on the date hereof.

     13.  Notice.  Any notice required or permitted to be given
under this Agreement shall be sufficient if in writing, and if
personally delivered or when sent by first class certified or
registered mail, postage prepaid, return receipt requested -- in
the case of the Executive, to his residence address as set forth
below, and in the case of the Company, to the address of its 
principal place of business, in care of the Board -- or to such
other person or at such other address with respect to each party
as such party shall notify the other in writing.
                                   -11-
     IN WITNESS WHEREOF, the parties have executed this Agreement
as of the date first above written.

EXHIBIT 10.9
                           USBANCORP, INC.
                         1991 STOCK OPTION PLAN
                            August 23, 1991, as
                       amended on February 24, 1995

          The purposes of the 1991 Stock Option Plan (the "Plan")
are to encourage eligible employees of USBANCORP, INC. (the
"Corporation") and its Subsidiaries, including Directors and
officers of the Corporation who are employees, to increase their
efforts to make the Corporation and each Subsidiary more
successful, to provide an additional inducement for such employees
to remain with the Corporation or a Subsidiary, to reward such
employees by providing an opportunity to acquire the Common Stock,
par value $2.50 per share, of the Corporation (the "Common Stock")
on favorable terms and to provide a means through which the
Corporation may attract able persons to enter the employment of the
Corporation or one of its Subsidiaries.  For purposes of the Plan,
the term "Subsidiary" means any corporation in an unbroken chain of
corporations beginning with the Corporation if each of the
corporations (other than the last corporation in the unbroken
chain) owns stock possessing at least fifty percent (50%) or more
of the total combined voting power of all classes of stock in one
of the other corporations in the chain.

                                 SECTION 1
                              Administration
          The Plan shall be administered by a Committee (the
"Committee") appointed from time to time by the Board of Directors
of the Corporation (the "Board") and consisting of no fewer than
three members of the Board, none of whom is, or was within one year
prior to becoming a member of the Committee, eligible for selection
as a person to whom stock options may be granted pursuant to the
Plan or any other plan of the Corporation or any of its affiliates
(as "affiliates" is defined in regulations of the Securities and
Exchange Commission under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as
amended (the "Exchange Act")) entitling the participants therein to
acquire stock or stock options of the Corporation or any of its
affiliates.  If at any time a member of the Committee would not be
eligible for initial appointment to the Committee, said member
shall be deemed to have resigned from the Committee.  The Board may
at any time, without cause, remove any person from the Committee by
written notice to such person.  Any member of the Committee may
resign by written notice to the Board.

          The Committee shall interpret the Plan and prescribe such
rules, regulations and procedures in connection with the operations
of the Plan as it shall deem to be necessary and advisable for the
administration of the Plan consistent with the purposes of the
Plan.
          The Committee shall keep records of any action taken at
its meetings.  A majority of the Committee shall constitute a
quorum at any meeting and the acts of a majority of the members
present at any meeting at which a quorum is present, or acts
approved in writing by a majority of the Committee, shall be the
acts of the Committee.
                                 SECTION 2
                                Eligibility
          Those salaried employees of the Corporation or any
Subsidiary with executive, managerial, technical or professional
responsibility, who may or may not be an officer or a member of the
Board of Directors, shall be eligible to receive stock options as
described herein.
          Subject to the provisions of the Plan, the Committee
shall have full and final authority, in its discretion, to grant
stock options as described herein and to determine the employees to
whom stock options shall be granted and the number of shares to be
covered by each stock option.  In determining the eligibility of
any employee, as well as in determining the number of shares which
may be acquired pursuant to each stock option, the Committee shall
consider the positions and the responsibilities of the employee
being considered, the nature and value to the Corporation or a
Subsidiary of his or her services, his or her present and/or
potential contribution to the success of the Corporation or a
Subsidiary and such other factors as the Committee may deem
relevant.
                                 SECTION 3
                      Shares Available under the Plan
          The aggregate number of shares of the Common Stock which
may be issued or delivered and as to which stock options may be
granted under the Plan is 285,000 shares.  All of such shares are
subject to adjustment and substitution as set forth in Section 6.
          If any stock option granted under the Plan is cancelled
by mutual consent or terminates or expires for any reason without
having been exercised in full, the number of shares subject to such
stock option shall again be available for purposes of the Plan.
          The shares which may be issued or delivered under the
Plan may be either authorized but unissued shares or treasury
shares or partly each, as shall be determined from time to time by
the Board.
                                 SECTION 4
                          Grant of Stock Options
          The Committee shall have authority, in its discretion, to
grant "incentive stock options" pursuant to Section 422 of the
Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the "Code"), to grant
"non-statutory stock options" (stock options which do not qualify
under such Section 422 of the Code) or to grant both types of stock
options, provided that the exercise of one type of option shall not
affect the other type.
          To the extent that the aggregate fair market value of
stock with respect to which incentive stock options are exercisable
for the first time by any individual during any calendar year
(under all plans of the individual's employer corporation and its
parent and subsidiary corporations) exceeds $100,000, such stock
options shall be treated as options which are non-statutory stock
options.  The preceding sentence shall be applied by taking options
into account in the order in which they are granted.  Also, for
this purpose, the fair market value of any stock shall be
determined as of the date the option with respect to such stock was
granted.
                                 SECTION 5
                   Terms and Conditions of Stock Options
          Stock options granted under the Plan shall be subject to
the following terms and conditions:

          (A)  The purchase price at which each stock option may be
     exercised (the "option price") shall be such price as the
     Committee, in its discretion, shall determine but shall not be
     less than one hundred percent (100%) of the fair market value
     per share of Common Stock which may be acquired pursuant to
     the stock option on the date of grant, except that in the case
     of an incentive stock option granted to an employee who,
     immediately prior to such grant, owns stock possessing more
     than ten percent (10%) of the total combined voting power of
     all classes of stock of the Corporation or any Subsidiary (a
     "Ten Percent Employee"), the option price shall not be less
     than 110% of such fair market value on the date of grant.  For
     purposes of this Section 5(A), the fair market value of the
     Common Stock shall be determined as provided in Section 5(H)
     below.  Also, for purposes of this Section 5(A), an individual
     (i) shall be considered as owning not only shares of the
     Common Stock owned individually, but also all shares that are
     at the time owned, directly or indirectly, by or for the
     spouse, ancestors, lineal descendants and brothers and sisters
     (whether by the whole or half blood) of such individual and
     (ii) shall be considered as owning proportionately any shares
     owned, directly or indirectly, by or for any corporation,
     partnership, estate or trust in which such individual shall be
     a stockholder, partner or beneficiary.

          (B)  The option price shall be payable in full in any one
     or more of the following ways:

               (i)  in cash; and/or
               (ii)  in shares of the Common Stock (which are owned
          by the optionee free and clear of all liens and other
          encumbrances and which are not subject to the
          restrictions set forth in Section 7 below) having a fair
          market value on the date of exercise of the stock option,
          determined as provided in Section 5(H), equal to the
          option price for the shares being purchased.

          If the option price is paid in whole or in part in shares
of Common Stock, any portion of the option price representing a
fraction of a share shall be paid in cash.  The date of exercise of
a stock option shall be determined under procedures established by
the Committee, and the option price shall be payable at such time
or times as the Committee, in its discretion, shall determine.  No
shares shall be issued or delivered upon exercise of a stock option
until full payment of the option price has been made.  When full
payment of the option price has been made and subject to the
restrictions set forth in Section 7, the optionee shall be
considered for all purposes to be the owner of the shares with
respect to which payment has been made.  Payment of the option
price with shares shall not increase the number of shares of Common
Stock which may be issued or delivered under the Plan as provided
in Section 3.

          (C)  Subject to Section 8 hereof, stock options may be
     exercised at the following rate.  On or after the first
     anniversary of the date on which the options were granted (the
     "Grant Date"), one-third of such options may be exercised
     (rounded upward to the nearest whole share).  On or after the
     second anniversary of the Grant Date two-thirds of such
     options may be exercised (rounded upward to the nearest whole
     share) minus the aggregate number of such options previously
     exercised.  On or after the third anniversary of the Grant
     Date, the remainder of the options may be exercised.  No
     incentive stock option shall be exercisable after the
     expiration of ten years (five years in the case of a Ten
     Percent Employee) from the date of grant.  No non-statutory
     stock option shall be exercisable after the expiration of ten
     years and six months from the date of grant.  Subject to this
     Section 5(C) and Sections 5(F), 5(G) and 5(H) below, stock
     options may be exercised at such times, in such amounts and
     subject to such restrictions as shall be determined, in its
     discretion, by the Committee.

          (D)  No stock option rights shall be transferable by an
     optionee other than by will, or if an optionee dies intestate,
     by the laws of descent and distribution of the state of
     domicile of the optionee at the time of death, and all stock
     options shall be exercisable during the lifetime of an
     optionee only by the optionee.

          (E)  Unless otherwise determined by the Committee and set
     forth in the stock option agreement referred to in
     Section 5(G) or an amendment thereto:

               (i)  If the employment of an optionee who is not a
          Disabled Optionee (as defined in Section 5(F) below) is
          voluntarily terminated with the consent of the
          Corporation or a Subsidiary, any then outstanding stock
          option held by such an optionee shall be exercisable (to
          the extent exercisable on the date of termination of
          employment) by such an optionee at any time prior to the
          earlier of the expiration date of such stock option or
          the date which is three months after the date of
          termination of employment;
               (ii)  If an optionee retires under any retirement
          plan of the Corporation or a Subsidiary, any then
          outstanding stock option held by such an optionee shall
          be exercisable in full (whether or not so exercisable on
          the date of termination of employment) by such an
          optionee at any time prior to the earlier of the
          expiration date of such stock option or the date which is
          three months after the date of termination of employment;
               (iii)  If the employment of an optionee who is a
          Disabled Optionee is terminated, any then outstanding
          stock option held by such optionee shall be exercisable
          in full (whether or not so exercisable on the date of
          termination of employment) by the optionee at any time
          prior to the earlier of the expiration date of such stock
          option or the date which is one year after the date of
          termination of employment;
               (iv)  The following transfers of employees will not
          be treated as a termination of employment:
                    (a)  A transfer of an employee between
               Subsidiaries of the Corporation;
                    (b)  A transfer of an employee from the
               Corporation to one of its Subsidiaries; or
                    (c)  A transfer of an employee to the
               Corporation from one of its Subsidiaries.
               (v)  Following the death of an optionee during
          employment, any outstanding stock option held by the
          optionee at the time of death shall be exercisable in
          full (whether or not so exercisable on the date of the
          death of the optionee) by the person or persons entitled
          to do so under the will of the optionee, or, if the
          optionee shall fail to make testamentary disposition of
          the stock option or shall die intestate, by the legal
          representative of the optionee, at any time prior to the
          expiration date of such stock option or within one year
          after the date of death, whichever is the shorter period. 
          Following the death of an optionee after termination of
          employment during a period when a stock option is
          exercisable as provided in clauses (i), (ii) and (iii)
          above, any outstanding stock option held by the optionee
          at the time of death shall, to the extent the stock
          option was exercisable by the optionee at the time of
          death, be exercisable by such person or persons as would
          have been so entitled had the employee died prior to the
          termination of employment, so long as such exercise
          occurs prior to the earlier of the expiration date of
          such stock option or the date which is one year after the
          date of death.
          (F)  If the employment of an optionee terminates for any
     reason other than voluntary termination with the consent of
     the Corporation or a Subsidiary, disability, retirement under
     any retirement plan of the Corporation or a Subsidiary, or
     death, the rights of such optionee under any then outstanding
     stock option shall terminate at the time of such termination
     of employment.  In addition, the Committee may in its
     discretion immediately terminate all stock options held by the
     optionee if an optionee (i) engages in the operation or
     management of a business, whether as owner, partner, officer,
     director, employee or otherwise and whether during or after
     termination of employment, which is in competition with the
     Corporation or any of its Subsidiaries; (ii) uses for his own
     benefit or discloses to a third party information pertaining
     to the Corporation or any of its Subsidiaries which the
     Corporation or its Subsidiaries consider to be confidential;
     or (iii) interferes with the relationship between the
     Corporation or a Subsidiary and its employees, suppliers or
     customers.

          "Disabled Optionee" shall mean an individual who is
     unable to engage in any substantial gainful activity by reason
     of any medically determinable physical or mental impairment
     which can be expected to result in death or which has lasted
     or can be expected to last for a continuous period of not less
     than 12 months.

          Whether termination of employment is a voluntary
     termination with the consent of the Corporation or a
     Subsidiary; whether an optionee is a Disabled Optionee;
     whether an optionee has engaged in the operation or management
     of a business which is in competition with the Corporation or
     any of its Subsidiaries; whether an optionee uses for his own
     benefit or discloses to a third party information pertaining
     to the Corporation or any of its Subsidiaries which is
     confidential; and whether an optionee has interfered with the
     relationship between the Corporation or a Subsidiary and its
     employees, suppliers or customers shall be determined in each
     case by the Committee, whose determination shall be final and
     binding unless such determination is demonstratably arbitrary
     and capricious.

          (G)  All stock options shall be confirmed by a stock
     option agreement, or an amendment thereto, which shall be
     executed by the Chief Executive Officer, the President (if
     other than the Chief Executive Officer) or any Executive Vice
     President on behalf of the Corporation and by the employee to
     whom such stock options are granted.

          (H)  Fair market value of the Common Stock, so long as
     the Common Stock trades in the Over-the-Counter market or on
     a stock exchange, shall be computed by taking a weighted
     average of the mean between the highest and lowest selling
     prices per share of the Common Stock as quoted in such
     reliable publication as the Committee, in its discretion, may
     choose to rely upon, on the nearest date before and the
     nearest date after the date as of which fair market value is
     to be determined on which there are sales.

          If at any time the Common Stock does not trade in the
     Over-the-Counter market or on a stock exchange, the fair
     market value of the Common Stock shall be determined by an
     independent and experienced appraiser which is selected by the
     Committee.  Fair market value shall be determined without
     regard to any restriction applicable to the Common Stock other
     than a restriction which, by its terms, will never lapse.

          (I)  The obligation of the Corporation to issue or
     deliver shares of the Common Stock under the Plan shall be
     subject to (i) the effectiveness of a registration statement
     under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, with respect to
     such shares, if deemed necessary or appropriate by counsel for
     the Corporation, (ii) the condition that the shares shall have
     been listed (or authorized for listing upon official notice of
     issuance) upon each stock exchange on which such shares may
     then be listed and (iii) all other applicable laws,
     regulations, rules and orders which may then be in effect;
     provided, however, that if the Company Stock shall be delisted
     from all national stock exchanges and/or deregistered in
     accordance with the provisions of the Securities Exchange Act
     of 1934, as amended, the Corporation shall have the obligation
     to issue and deliver shares of Common Stock under the Plan
     upon the exercise of any then outstanding stock option.

          Subject to the foregoing provisions of this Section 5 and
the other provisions of the Plan, any stock option granted under
the Plan shall be subject to such other terms and conditions as the
Committee shall deem advisable.
                                 SECTION 6
                   Adjustment and Substitution of Shares
          If a dividend or other distribution shall be declared
upon the Common Stock payable in shares of Common Stock, the number
of shares of Common Stock then subject to any outstanding stock
option and the number of shares which may be issued or delivered
under the Plan but are not then subject to an outstanding stock
option shall be adjusted by adding thereto the number of shares
which would have been distributable thereon if such shares had been
outstanding on the date fixed for determining the stockholders
entitled to receive such stock dividend or distribution.

          If the outstanding shares of Common Stock shall be
changed into or exchangeable for a different number or kind of
shares of stock or other securities of the Corporation or another
corporation, whether through reorganization, reclassification,
recapitalization, stock split-up, combination of shares, merger or
consolidation, then there shall be substituted for each share of
Common Stock subject to any then outstanding stock option and for
each share of Common Stock which may be issued or delivered under
the Plan but is not then subject to an outstanding stock option,
the number and kind of shares of stock or other securities into
which each outstanding share of Common Stock shall be so changed or
for which each such share shall be exchangeable.

          In the case of any adjustment or substitution as provided
for in this Section 6, the aggregate option price for all shares
subject to each then outstanding stock option prior to such
adjustment or substitution shall be the aggregate option price for
all shares of stock or other securities (including any fraction) to
which such shares shall have been adjusted or which shall have been
substituted for such shares.  Any new option price per share shall
be carried to at least three decimal places with the last decimal
place rounded upwards to the nearest whole number.

          No adjustment or substitution provided for in this
Section 6 shall require the Corporation to issue or sell a fraction
of a share or other security.  Accordingly, all fractional shares
or other securities which result from any such adjustment or
substitution shall be eliminated and not carried forward to any
subsequent adjustment or substitution.

          If any such adjustment or substitution provided for in
this Section 6 requires the approval of stockholders in order to
enable the Corporation to grant incentive stock options, then no
such adjustment or substitution shall be made without prior
stockholder approval.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the case
of incentive stock options, if the effect of any such adjustment or
substitution would be to cause the stock option to fail to continue
to qualify as an incentive stock option or to cause a modification,
extension or renewal of such stock option within the meaning of
Section 424 of the Code, the Committee may elect that such
adjustment or substitution not be made but rather shall use
reasonable efforts to effect such other adjustment of each then
outstanding stock option as the Committee in its sole discretion
shall deem equitable and which will not result in any
disqualification, modification, extension or renewal (within the
meaning of Section 424 of the Code) of such incentive stock option.
                                 SECTION 7
                Restrictions on Transfer of Certain Shares
          Shares of Common Stock acquired under exercise of an
option pursuant to Section 5(B)(ii) by a person then subject to the
provisions of Section 16 of the Exchange Act shall not be sold or
otherwise transferred prior to the expiration of six months after
the date of the grant of the option.  The Corporation is authorized
to (i) retain the certificate(s) representing such shares or place
such certificates in the custody of its transfer agent, (ii) place
a restrictive legend on such shares, and/or (iii) issue a stop
transfer order to the transfer agent with respect to such shares in
order to enforce the transfer restrictions of this Section.
                                 SECTION 8
            Acceleration of the Exercise Date of Stock Options
          Notwithstanding any other provision of this Plan, all
stock options shall become exercisable upon the occurrence of any
of the events listed below whether or not such options are then
exercisable under the provisions of the applicable agreements
relating thereto:

          (A)  Stock option rights shall be exercisable during any
     one or more of the following periods:

               (i)  for a period of 60 days beginning on the date
          on which shares of Common Stock are first purchased
          pursuant to a tender offer or exchange offer (other than
          such an offer by the Corporation or a Subsidiary),
          whether or not such offer is approved or opposed by the
          Corporation or a Subsidiary and regardless of the number
          of shares of Common Stock purchased pursuant to such
          offer;
               (ii)  for a period of 60 days beginning on the date
          the Corporation acquires knowledge that any person or
          group deemed a person under Section 13(d)(3) of the
          Exchange Act (other than any director of the Corporation
          on August 23, 1991, any Affiliate or Associate of any
          such director (with such terms having the respective
          meanings set forth in Rule 12b-2 under the Exchange Act
          as in effect on August 23, 1991), any member of the
          family of any such director, any trust (including the
          trustees thereof) established by or for the benefit of
          any such persons, or any charitable foundation, whether
          a trust or a corporation (including the trustees and
          directors thereof) established by any of such persons),
          in a transaction or series of transactions shall become
          the beneficial owner, directly or indirectly (with
          beneficial ownership determined as provided in Rule 13d-
          3, or any successor rule, under the Exchange Act), of
          securities of the Corporation entitling the person or
          group to 20% or more of all votes (without consideration
          of the rights of any class of stock to elect directors by
          a separate class vote) to which all shareholders of the
          Corporation would be entitled if the election of
          Directors were an election held on such date;
               (iii)  for a period of 60 days beginning on the date
          of filing under the Exchange Act of a Statement on
          Schedule 13D, or any amendment thereto, by any person or
          group deemed a person under Section 13(d)(3) of the
          Exchange Act, disclosing an intention or possible
          intention to acquire or change control of the
          Corporation;
               (iv)  for a period of 60 days beginning on the date,
          during any period of two consecutive years, when
          individuals who at the beginning of such period
          constitute the Board of Directors of the Corporation
          cease for any reason to constitute at least a majority
          thereof, unless the election, or the nomination for
          election by the shareholders of the Corporation, of each
          new Director was approved by a vote of at least two-
          thirds of the Directors then still in office who were
          Directors at the beginning of such period; and
               (v)  for a period of 60 days beginning on the date
          of approval by the shareholders of the Corporation of an
          agreement (a "reorganization agreement") providing for
          (a) the merger or consolidation of the Corporation with
          another corporation where the shareholders of the
          Corporation, immediately prior to the merger or
          consolidation, will not beneficially own, immediately
          after the merger or consolidation, shares of the
          corporation issuing cash or securities in the merger or
          consolidation entitling such shareholders to 40% or more
          of all votes (without consideration of the rights of any
          class of stock to elect directors by a separate class
          vote) to which all shareholders of such corporation would
          be entitled in the election of Directors or where the
          members of the Board of Directors of the Corporation,
          immediately prior to the merger or consolidation, do not,
          immediately after the merger or consolidation, constitute
          a majority of the Board of Directors of the corporation
          issuing cash or securities in the merger or consolidation
          or (b) the sale or other disposition of all or
          substantially all the assets of the Corporation.
                                SECTION 9
        Effect of the Plan on the Rights of Employees and Employer
          Neither the adoption of the Plan nor any action of the
Board or the Committee pursuant to the Plan shall be deemed to give
any employee any right to be granted a stock option under the Plan
and nothing in the Plan, in any stock option granted under the Plan
or in any stock option agreement shall confer any right upon any
employee to continue in the employment of the Corporation or any
Subsidiary or diminish in any way the right of the Corporation or
any Subsidiary to terminate the employment of any employee at any
time.  The granting of a stock option shall impose no obligation
upon the Optionee to exercise such option.
                                SECTION 10
                                 Amendment
          The right to alter and amend the Plan at any time and
from time to time and the right to revoke or terminate the Plan are
hereby specifically reserved to the Board; provided always that no
such revocation or termination shall terminate any outstanding
stock option theretofore granted under the Plan; and provided
further that no such alteration or amendment of the Plan shall,
without prior stockholder approval, (a) increase the total number
of shares which may be issued under the Plan, (b) increase the
total number of shares issuable pursuant to any stock option
granted to any one optionee, (c) make any changes in the class of
eligible employees or (d) extend the period set forth in the Plan
during which stock options may be granted.  No alteration,
amendment, revocation or termination of the Plan shall, without the
written consent of the holder of a stock option theretofore granted
under the Plan, adversely affect the rights of such holder with
respect to such stock option.
                                SECTION 11
                    Effective Date and Duration of Plan
          The effective date and date of adoption of the Plan shall
be August 23, 1991 (the "Effective Date"), the date of adoption of
the Plan by the Board, provided that such adoption of the Plan by
the Board is approved by the affirmative vote of the holders of at
least a majority of the outstanding shares of Common Stock at a
meeting of such holders duly called, convened and held within one
year of the Effective Date.  Notwithstanding any provision of the
Plan to the contrary, no stock option granted under the Plan prior
to such shareholder approval may be exercised until after such
approval.  No stock option may be granted under the Plan subsequent
to the date which is ten (10) years following the effective date of
the Plan.
                                SECTION 12
                           Application of Funds
          The proceeds received by the Corporation for the sale of
the Common Stock pursuant to exercise of stock options shall be
used for general corporate purposes.
                                SECTION 13
                         Reservation of the Stock
          The Corporation shall be under no obligation to purchase
or reserve Common Stock to satisfy the exercise of stock options. 
The grant of stock options to employees hereunder shall not be
construed to constitute the establishment of a trust of the Common
Stock issuable pursuant to such stock options, and no particular
Common Stock shall be identified as optioned and reserved for
employees hereunder.  The Corporation shall be deemed to have
complied with the terms of the Plan if, at the time of issuance and
delivery pursuant to the exercise of a stock option, it has a
sufficient number of shares of the Common Stock authorized and
unissued or in its treasury which may then be appropriated and
issued for purposes of the Plan, irrespective of the date when such
Common Stock was authorized.
                                SECTION 14
                               Governing Law
          The Plan and all determinations and actions taken
pursuant thereto shall be governed by the laws of the Commonwealth
of Pennsylvania and construed in accordance therewith.

          This Plan has been prepared, negotiated and delivered in,
and shall be construed and enforced in accordance with, the laws of
the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania.

           TERM OF SERIES C JUNIOR PARTICIPATING PREFERRED STOCK
           OF
           USBANCORP, INC.
    
          RESOLVED that, pursuant to the authority vested in the
Board of Directors of the Corporation by the Articles of
Incorporation, the Board of Directors does hereby provide for the
issue of a series of Preferred Stock, without par value, of the
Corporation, to be designated "Series C Junior Participating
Preferred Stock" (hereinafter referred to as the "Series C
Preferred Stock" or "this Series"), initially consisting of
60,000 shares, and to the extent that the designations, powers,
preferences and relative and other special rights and the

Preferred Stock are not stated and expressed in the Articles of
Incorporation, does hereby fix and herein state and express such

          1.   Designation and Amount.  The designation of the

shares constituting such Series is Sixty Thousand (60,000).  Such
number of shares may be increased or decreased by resolution of

shares reserved for issuance upon the exercise of outstanding
options, rights or warrants or upon the conversion of any
outstanding securities of the Corporation convertible into shares
of this Series.

          2.   Dividends.
               (A)  Subject to the prior and superior rights of
the holders of any shares of any series of Preferred Stock
ranking prior and superior to the shares of this Series with
respect to dividends, the holders of shares of this Series shall
be entitled to receive, when and as declared by the Board of
Directors out of funds legally available for the purpose,
quarterly dividends payable in cash on April 1, July 1,
October 1, and January 1 of each year (each such date being
referred to herein as a "Quarterly Dividend Payment Date"),
commencing on the first Quarterly Dividend Payment Date after the
first issuance of a share or fraction of a share of this Series,
in an amount per share (rounded to the nearest cent) equal to the
greater of (a) $10.00 or (b) subject to the provision for
adjustment hereinafter set forth, 100 times the aggregate per
share amount of all cash dividends, and 100 times the aggregate
per share amount (payable in kind) of all non-cash dividends or
other distributions other than a dividend payable in shares of
Common Stock or a subdivision of the outstanding shares of Common
Stock (by reclassification or otherwise), declared on the Common
Stock since the immediately preceding Quarterly Dividend Payment
Date, or, with respect to the first Quarterly Dividend Payment
Date, since the first issuance of any share or fraction of a
share of this Series.  In the event the Company shall at any time
after February 24, 1995 (the "Rights Declaration Date") declare
any dividend on the Common Stock payable in shares of Common
Stock, subdivide the outstanding shares of Common Stock, or
combine the outstanding shares of Common Stock into a smaller
number of shares, then in each such case the amount to which
holders of shares of this Series were entitled immediately prior
to such event under clause (b) of the preceding sentence shall be
adjusted by multiplying such amount by a fraction the numerator
of which is the number of shares of Common Stock outstanding
immediately after such event and the denominator of which is the
number of shares of Common Stock that were outstanding
immediately prior to such event.

               (B)  The Company shall declare a dividend or
distribution on the Series C Preferred Stock as provided in
paragraph (A) of this Section immediately after it declares a
dividend or distribution on the Common Stock (other than a
dividend payable in shares of Common Stock); provided that, in
the event no dividend or distribution shall have been declared on
the Common Stock during the period between any Quarterly Dividend
Payment Date and the next subsequent Quarterly Dividend Payment
Date, a dividend of $10.00 per share on Series C Preferred Stock
shall nevertheless be payable on such subsequent Quarterly
Dividend Payment Date.

               (C)  Dividends shall begin to accrue and be
cumulative on outstanding shares of Series C Preferred Stock from
the Quarterly Dividend Payment Date next preceding the date of
issue of such shares of this Series, unless the date of issue of
such shares is prior to the record date for the first Quarterly
Dividend Payment Date in which case dividends on such shares
shall begin to accrue from the date of issue of such shares, or
unless the date of issue is a Quarterly Dividend Payment Date or
is a date after the record date for the determination of holders
of shares of this Series entitled to receive a quarterly dividend
and before such Quarterly Dividend Payment Date, in either of
which events such dividends shall begin to accrue and be
cumulative from such Quarterly Dividend Payment Date.  Accrued
but unpaid dividends shall not bear interest.  Dividends paid on
the shares of this Series in an amount less than the total amount
of such dividends at the time accrued and payable on such shares
shall be allocated pro rata on a share-by-share basis among all
such shares at the time outstanding.  The Board of Directors may
fix a record date for the determination of holders of shares of
this Series entitled to receive payment of a dividend or
distribution declared thereon, which record date shall be no more
than ten (10) days prior to the date fixed for the payment
thereof.

          3.  Voting Rights.  The holders of shares of Series C
Preferred Stock shall have the following voting rights:

               (A)  Subject to the provision for adjustment
hereinafter set forth, each share of Series C Preferred Stock
shall entitle the holder thereof to 100 votes on all matters
submitted to a vote of the shareholders of the Corporation.  In
the event the Corporation shall at any time declare or pay any
dividend on the Common Shares payable in Common Shares, or effect
a subdivision or combination or consolidation of the outstanding
shares of Common Stock (by reclassification or otherwise than by
payment of a dividend in shares of Common Stock) into a greater
or lesser number of shares of Common Stock, then in each such
case the number of votes per share to which holders of shares of
Series C Preferred Stock were entitled immediately prior to such
event shall be adjusted by multiplying such number by a fraction,
the numerator of which is the number of shares of Common Stock
outstanding immediately after such event and the denominator of
which is the number of shares of Common Stock that were
outstanding immediately prior to such event.

               (B)  Except as otherwise provided herein, in any
other resolutions creating a series of Preferred Stock or any
similar stock, or by law, the holders of shares of Series C
Preferred Stock and the holders of Common Stock and any other
capital stock of the Corporation having general voting rights
shall vote together as one class on all matters submitted to a
vote of stockholders of the Corporation.

               (C)  Except as set forth herein, or as otherwise
provided by law, holders of Series C Preferred Stock shall have
no special voting rights and their consent shall not be required
(except to the extent they are entitled to vote with holders of
Common Stock as set forth herein) for taking any corporate
action.

          4.   Certain Restrictions.
               (A)  Whenever quarterly dividends or other
dividends or distributions payable on the Series C Preferred
Stock as provided in Section 2 are in arrears, thereafter and
until all accrued and unpaid dividends and distributions, whether
or not declared, on shares of Series C Preferred Stock
outstanding shall have been paid in full, the Corporation shall
not:

                    (i)  declare or pay dividends, or make any
     other distributions, on any shares of stock ranking junior
     (either as to dividends or upon liquidation, dissolution or
     winding up) to the Series C Preferred Stock;
                    (ii)  declare or pay dividends, or make any
     other distributions, on any shares of stock ranking on a
     parity (either as to dividends or upon liquidation,
     dissolution or winding up) with the Series C Preferred
     Stock, except dividends paid ratably on the Series C
     Preferred Stock and all such parity stock on which dividends
     are payable or in arrears in proportion to the total amounts
     to which the holders of all such shares are then entitled;
                    (iii)  redeem or purchase or otherwise
     acquire for consideration shares of any stock ranking junior
     (either as to dividends or upon liquidation, dissolution or
     winding up) to the Series C Preferred Stock, provided that
     the Corporation may at any time redeem, purchase or
     otherwise acquire shares of any such junior stock in
     exchange for shares of any stock of the Corporation ranking
     junior (either as to dividends or upon dissolution,
     liquidation or winding up) to the Series C Preferred Stock;
     or
                    (iv)  redeem or purchase or otherwise acquire
     for consideration any shares of Series C Preferred Stock, or
     any shares of stock ranking on a parity with the Series C
     Preferred Stock, except in accordance with a purchase offer
     made in writing or by publication (as determined by the
     Board of Directors) to all holders of such shares upon such
     terms as the Board of Directors, after consideration of the
     respective annual dividend rates and other relative rights
     and preferences of the respective series and classes, shall
     determine in good faith will result in fair and equitable
     treatment among the respective series or classes.

          (B)  The Corporation shall not permit any subsidiary 
of the Corporation to purchase or otherwise acquire for
consideration any shares of stock of the Corporation unless the
Corporation could, under paragraph (A) of this Section 4,
purchase or otherwise acquire such shares at such time and in
such manner.

          5.   Reacquired Shares.  Any shares of Series C
Preferred Stock purchased or otherwise acquired by the
Corporation in any manner whatsoever shall be retired and
cancelled promptly after the acquisition thereof.  All such
shares shall upon their cancellation become authorized but
unissued shares of Preferred Stock and may be reissued as part of
a new series of Preferred Stock subject to the conditions and
restrictions on issuance set forth herein, in the Articles of
Incorporation, or in any other resolutions creating a series of
Preferred Stock or any similar stock or as otherwise required by
law.

          6.   Liquidation, Dissolution or Winding Up.  Upon any
liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the Corporation, no
distribution shall be made (A) to the holders of shares of stock
ranking junior (either as to dividends or upon liquidation,
dissolution or winding up) to the Series C Preferred Stock
unless, prior thereto, the holders of shares of Series C
Preferred Stock shall have received $100.00 per share, plus an
amount equal to accrued and unpaid dividends and distributions
thereon, whether or not declared, to the date of such payment,
provided that the holders of shares of Series C Preferred Stock
shall be entitled to receive an aggregate amount per share,
subject to the provision for adjustment hereinafter set forth,
equal to 100 times the aggregate amount to be distributed per
share to holders of Common Stock, or (B) to the holders of shares
of stock ranking on a parity (either as to dividends or upon
liquidation, dissolution or winding up) with the Series C
Preferred Stock, except distributions made ratably on the
Series C Preferred Stock and all such parity stock in proportion
to the total amounts to which the holders of all such shares are
entitled upon such liquidation, dissolution or winding up.  In
the event the Corporation shall at any time declare or pay any
dividend on the outstanding shares of Common Stock payable in
shares of Common Stock, or effect a subdivision or combination or
consolidation of the outstanding shares of Common Stock (by
reclassification or otherwise than by payment of a dividend in
shares of Common Stock) into a greater or lesser number of shares
of Common Stock, then in each such case the aggregate amount to
which holders of shares of Series C Preferred Stock were entitled
immediately prior to such event under the proviso in clause (A)
of the preceding sentence shall be adjusted by multiplying such
amount by a fraction the numerator of which is the number of
shares of Common Stock outstanding immediately after such event
and the denominator of which is the number of shares of Common
Stock that were outstanding immediately prior to such event.

          7.   Consolidation, Merger, Etc.  In case the
Corporation shall enter into any consolidation, merger,
combination or other transaction in which the outstanding shares
of Common Stock are exchanged for or changed into other stock or
securities, cash and/or any other property, then in any such case
each share of Series C Preferred Stock shall at the same time be
similarly exchanged or changed into an amount per share, subject
to the provision for adjustment hereinafter set forth, equal to
100 times the aggregate amount of stock, securities, cash and/or
any other property (payable in kind), as the case may be, into
which or for which each share of Common Stock is changed or
exchanged.  In the event the Corporation shall at any time
declare or pay any dividend on the Common Stock payable in shares
of Common Stock, or effect a subdivision or combination or
consolidation of the outstanding shares of Common Stock (by
reclassification or otherwise than by payment of a dividend in
shares of Common Stock) into a greater or lesser number of shares
of Common Stock, then in each such case the amount set forth in
the preceding sentence with respect to the exchange or change of
shares of Series C Preferred Stock shall be adjusted by
multiplying such amount by a fraction, the numerator of which is
the number of shares of Common Stock outstanding immediately
after such event and the denominator of which is the number of
shares of Common Stock that were outstanding immediately prior to
such event.

          8.   No Redemption.  The shares of Series C Preferred
Stock shall not be redeemable.

          9.   Rank.  The Series C Preferred Stock shall rank,
with respect to the payment of dividends and the distribution of
assets, junior to all series of any other class of the
Corporation's Preferred Stock.

          10.  Amendment.  The Articles of Incorporation of the
Corporation shall not be amended in any manner which would
materially alter or change the powers, preferences or special
rights of the Series C Preferred Stock so as to affect them
adversely without the affirmative vote of the holders of at least
two-thirds of the outstanding shares of Series C Preferred Stock,
voting together as a single class.

EXHIBIT 10.10
                                 AGREEMENT

     This Agreement (the "Agreement") made the 1st day of
December, 1994, by and between USBANCORP, Inc. (the "Company"), a
Pennsylvania corporation, having its principal place of business
at Main and Franklin Streets, Post Office Box 430, Johnstown,
Pennsylvania 15907-0430, and RONALD W. VIRAG 
("Executive").
     WHEREAS, the Executive is the President and Chief Executive
Officer of USBANCORP Trust Company, ("USBANCORP Trust"), a trust
company organized under Pennsylvania law, directly owned by the
Company.
     WHEREAS, the Board of Directors of the Company (the "Board")
has determined that it is in the best interest of the Company and
its shareholders to ensure that the Company and USBANCORP Trust
will have the continued dedication of the Executive,
notwithstanding the possibility, threat or occurrence of a Change
in Control (as defined below) of the Company.  The Board believes
it is imperative to diminish the inevitable distraction of the
Executive by virtue of the personal uncertainties and risks
created by a pending or threatened Change in Control and to
encourage the Executive's full attention and dedication to
USBANCORP Trust currently and in the event of any threatened or
pending Change in Control, and to provide the Executive with
compensation and benefits arrangements upon a Change in Control
which ensure that the compensation and benefits expectations of
the Executive will be satisfied and which are competitive with
those of other corporations.

     NOW THEREFORE, in consideration of the premises and mutual
covenants contained herein, and intending to be legally bound
hereby, the parties hereto agree as follows:
     
     1.  Term.  This Agreement shall be for a three (3) year
period commencing on the date first set forth above and shall be
automatically renewed on the first and on each subsequent annual
anniversary of the above day and month ("Annual Renewal Date")
for a period ending three (3) years from each Annual Renewal Date
unless either party shall give written notice of non-renewal at
least sixty (60) days prior to the Annual Renewal Date.
     
     2.  Change in Control.  As used in this Agreement, Change in
Control shall mean the occurrence of any of the following:
          (a)  any "person" or "group" (as those terms are
defined or used in Section 13(d) of the Securities Exchange Act
of 1934 (the "Exchange Act"), as enacted and in force on the date
hereof) is or becomes the "beneficial owner" (as that term is
defined in Rule 13d-3 under the Exchange Act, as enacted and in
force on the date hereof) of securities of the Company
representing 24.99% or more of the combined voting power of the
Company's securities then outstanding;
          (b)  there occurs a merger, consolidation, share
exchange, division or other reorganization involving the Company
and another entity in which Company shareholders do 
     not continue to hold a majority of the capital stock of the 
     resulting entity, or a sale, exchange, transfer, or other
                                    -2-
     disposition of substantially all of the assets of the  
Company to another entity or other person; or
          (c)  there occurs a contested proxy solicitation or 
     solicitations of the Company's shareholders which results in
     the contesting party or parties obtaining the ability to
     elect a majority of the members of the Board of Directors
     standing for election at one or more meetings of the
     Company's shareholders.

     3.  Triggering Events.  If a Change in Control shall occur
and if thereafter, at any time during the term of this Agreement
there shall be:
          (a)  any involuntary termination of the Executive by 
     USBANCORP Trust, other than for Cause as defined in Section
     4 below;
          (b)  any reduction in the Executive's title,
responsibilities, including reporting responsibilities, or
authority, including such title, responsibilities, or authority
as such may be increased from time to time during the term of
this Agreement;
          (c)  the assignment to the Executive of duties
inconsistent with the Executive's office as such duties existed
on the day immediately prior to the date of a Change in Control;
          (d)  any reduction in the Executive's annual base 
     salary in effect on the day immediately prior to the date of
     a Change in Control;
                                    -3-

          (e)  any failure to continue the Executive's 
participation, on substantially similar terms, in any incentive
compensation or bonus plans of USBANCORP Trust in which the
Executive participated in immediately prior to the Change in
Control, or any change or amendment to any of the substantive
provisions of any of such plans which would materially decrease
the potential benefits to the Executive under any of such plans;
          (f)  any failure to provide the Executive with benefits
     at least as favorable as those enjoyed by the Executive
     under any pension, life insurance, medical, health and
     accident, disability or other employee plans of USBANCORP
     Trust in which the Executive participated in immediately
     prior to the time of the Change in Control, or the taking of
     any action that would materially reduce any of such benefits
     in effect at the time of the Change in Control, unless such
     reduction relates to a reduction in benefits applicable to
     all employees generally; or
          (g)  any breach of any provision of this Agreement by   
     the Company or USBANCORP Trust, which breach shall not have
     been cured by the Company or USBANCORP Trust within thirty
     (30) days of the Company's receipt from the Executive or his
     agent of written notice specifying in reasonable detail the
     nature of the Company's or USBANCORP Trust's breach;
                                    -4-
then Executive, at his sole discretion, may upon no less than 
ninety (90) days written notice to Company, resign from
employment with USBANCORP Trust (or, if involuntarily terminated,
give notice of intention to collect benefits under this
Agreement) by delivering written notice to the Company at any
time during the term of this Agreement.

     4.  Termination of Executive for Cause.  Upon or following a
Change in Control, the Company or USBANCORP Trust shall have the
right at any time to terminate the Executive's employment for
Cause.  In such event, the Company shall give prompt notice to
the Executive, specifying in reasonable detail the basis for such
termination.  For purposes of this Agreement, "Cause" shall mean
the following conduct of the Executive:
          (a)  Material breach of any provision of this
Agreement, which breach Executive shall have failed to cure
within thirty (30) days after Employee's receipt of written
notice from the Company specifying the specific nature of the
Executive's breach;
          (b)  Willful misconduct of Executive that is materially
     inimical to the best interests, monetary or otherwise, of
     the Company or USBANCORP Trust;
          (c)  Conviction of a felony or of any crime involving 
     moral turpitude, fraud or deceit;
          (d)  Adjudication as a bankrupt under the United States
     Bankruptcy Code.
                                    -5-
     5.  Compensation and Benefits.  Upon the occurrence of an
event set forth in Section 3 hereof and the delivery of a notice
of termination to the Company pursuant to Section 3 hereof, the
Executive shall be absolutely entitled to receive the
compensation and benefits set forth below:
          (a)  the Executive shall select, in his absolute
discretion, and receive either (i) monthly installments equal to
one thirty-sixth (1/36) of an amount equal to 2.99 times the
following:  (x) During the initial three-year term of this
Agreement (the "Initial Term") commencing on the date hereof, the
highest combined base salary and bonus paid or payable to the
Executive in the then current year or in any one of the last five
fiscal years preceding the Executive's delivery of a notice of
termination; or (y) After the expiration of the Initial Term, the
quotient obtained by dividing the sum of the Executive's combined
salary and bonuses in the five years preceding the Executive's
delivery of a notice of termination by five, such monthly
installments shall be payable for a period of one year (the
"Payment Period") commencing on the first day of the first
calendar month after Executive's delivery of notice of
termination, or (ii) a one time lump sum payment equal to the
non-discounted sum of the twelve (12) monthly payments provided
for in Section 5(a)(i) immediately above;
          (b)  from the date of the notice of termination through
     and including the last day of the Payment Period, the 
                                    -6-
     Executive shall be entitled to continue to participate in
     the employee retirement plan(s) of the Company and any
     supplemental executive retirement plan(s) (including
deferred profit sharing plan) or other plan in effect during the
term of this Agreement designed to supplement payments made under
such employee retirement plan, as the case may be, as if the
Executive's employment had not terminated;
          (c)  from the date of the notice of termination through
     and including the last day of the Payment Period, the
     Executive shall be provided with life, disability, and
     medical insurance benefits at levels equivalent to the
     highest levels in effect for the Executive during any one of
     the three (3) calendar years preceding the year in which the
     notice of termination is delivered; and
          (d)  on the date of the notice of termination, all 
     options held by the Executive to acquire common stock of the
     Company, to the extent not immediately exercisable by their
     terms, shall become immediately exercisable, and such
     options shall be exercisable by the Executive at any time
     prior to the earlier of the expiration date(s) of such stock
     options or the date which is ninety (90) days after the
     Executive's termination of employment with the Company.
     In the event the Executive is ineligible to continue
participation in the employee retirement plan of USBANCORP Trust
and/or any supplemental executive retirement plan (including
deferred profit sharing plan) or other plan in effect during the 
                                    -7-
term of this Agreement designed to supplement payments made under
such employee retirement plan or in any of USBANCORP Trust's
life, disability or medical insurance plans or programs, the
Company shall, in lieu of such participation, pay the Executive a
dollar amount equal to the dollar amount of the benefit forfeited
by the Executive as a result of such ineligibility or a dollar
amount equal to the cost to the Executive to obtain such benefits
in the case of any life, disability or medical insurance plans or
programs.

     6.  Beneficiary.  Should the Executive die after entitlement
but prior to payment in full of amounts due pursuant to Section
5(a)(i) hereof, such monthly payments shall continue (if such
payment option was so elected by Executive) to the Executive's
designated beneficiary or his estate until such entitlement has
been paid in full.

     7.  Employment at Will.  This Agreement contains the entire
understanding of the Company and the Executive with respect to
the subject matter hereof and, subject to the provisions of any
other agreement between the Executive and the Company, the
Executive shall remain an employee at will and nothing herein
shall confer upon the Executive any right to continued employment
and shall not affect the right of USBANCORP Trust to terminate
the Executive for any reason not prohibited by law; provided,
however, that any such removal shall be without prejudice to any
rights the Executive may have to compensation and benefits as 
provided for in Section 5 hereof.
                                    -8-
     8.  Arbitration.  Except as otherwise provided herein, in
the event of any controversy, dispute or claim arising out of, or
relating to this Agreement, or the breach thereof, the parties
may seek recourse only for temporary or preliminary injunctive
relief to the courts having jurisdiction thereof.  If any relief
other than injunctive relief is sought, the Company and the
Executive agree that such underlying controversy, dispute or
claim shall be settled by arbitration conducted in Pittsburgh,
Pennsylvania in accordance with this Section 8 and the Commercial
Arbitration Rules of the American Arbitration Association
("AAA").  The matter shall be heard and decided, and awards
rendered, by a panel of three (3) arbitrators (the "Arbitration
Panel").  The Company and Executive shall each select one
arbitrator from the AAA National Panel of Commercial Arbitrators
(the "Commercial Panel") and AAA shall select a third arbitrator
from the Commercial Panel.  The award rendered by the Arbitration
Panel shall be final and binding as between the parties hereto
and their heirs, executors, administrators, successors and
assigns, and judgment on the award may be entered by any court
having jurisdiction thereof.  Each party shall pay their
professional fees, expenses and costs incurred in connection with
the resolution of any controversy, dispute or claim arising out
of, or relating to this Agreement.

     9.  Assignment.  This Agreement shall be binding upon and
inure to the benefit of the successors and assigns of the
Company, and the Company shall require any successor to expressly
                                    -9-
acknowledge and assume its obligation hereunder.  This Agreement
shall be void and no further force and effect upon the Company's
sale of all the voting stock or assets of USBANCORP Trust to an
unrelated third party or to combine with another Company
affiliate, except if it is reasonably demonstrated such sale was
at the request of a third party who has taken steps reasonably
calculated to effect a Change in Control or such sale otherwise
arose in connection with or in anticipation of a Change in
Control.  This Agreement shall inure to the extent provided
hereunder to the benefit of and be enforceable by the Executive
or his/her legal representatives, executors, administrators,
successors, heirs, distributees, devisees and legatees.  The
Executive may not delegate any of his/her duties,
responsibilities, obligations or positions hereunder to any
person and any such purported delegation by him/her shall be void
and of no force and effect.

     10.  Prior Termination.  Anything in this Agreement to the
contrary notwithstanding, if the Executive's employment with 
USBANCORP Trust is terminated prior to the date on which a Change
in Control occurs either (a) by the Company or USBANCORP Trust
other than for Cause or (b) by the Executive for any one of the
reasons set forth in Section 3 hereof, and it is reasonably
demonstrated that such termination of employment (i) was at the
request of a third party who has taken steps reasonably
calculated to effect the Change in Control or (ii) otherwise
arose in connection with or 
                                   -10-
anticipation of the Change in Control, then for all purposes of
this Agreement the termination shall deemed to have occurred upon
a Change in Control and the Executive will be entitled to the 
compensation and benefits provided for in Section 5 hereof.

     11.  Release.  The Executive hereby acknowledges and agrees
that prior to the occurrence of the Executive's or his
dependent's right to receive from the Company or any of its
representatives or agents any compensation or benefit to be paid
or provided to him or his dependents pursuant to Section 5 of
this Agreement, the Executive may be required by the Company, in
its sole discretion, to execute a release in a form reasonably
acceptable to the Company, which releases any and all claims the
Executive has or may have against the Company or its
subsidiaries, agents, officers, directors, successors or assigns.

     12.  Compliance with Laws.  The parties hereto acknowledge
and agree that this Agreement and each party's enforcement of
their rights hereunder are subject to the Comprehensive Thrift
and Bank Fraud Prosecutions Act of 1990 (12 USC 1828) as enacted
and in force on the date hereof.

     13.  Notice.  Any notice required or permitted to be given
under this Agreement shall be sufficient if in writing, and if
personally delivered or when sent by first class certified or
registered mail, postage prepaid, return receipt requested -- in
the case of the Executive, to his residence address as set forth
below, and in the case of the Company, to the address of its 
                                   -11-
principal place of business, in care of the Board -- or to such
other person or at such other address with respect to each party
as such party shall notify the other in writing.
     
     IN WITNESS WHEREOF, the parties have executed this Agreement
as of the date first above written.

EXHIBIT 10.11
                                 AGREEMENT
     This Agreement (the "Agreement") made the 15th day of
July, 1994, by and between USBANCORP, Inc. (the "Company"), a
Pennsylvania corporation, having its principal place of business
at Main and Franklin Streets, Post Office Box 430, Johnstown,
Pennsylvania 15907-0430, and KEVIN J. O'NEIL 
("Executive").
     WHEREAS, the Executive is the President and Chief Executive
Officer of Standard Mortgage Corporation of Georgia, a mortgage
banking corporation ("Standard") indirectly owned by the Company.
     WHEREAS, the Board of Directors of the Company (the "Board")
has determined that it is in the best interest of the Company and
its shareholders to ensure that the Company and Standard will
have the continued dedication of the Executive, notwithstanding
the possibility, threat or occurrence of a Change in Control (as
defined below) of the Company.  The Board believes it is
imperative to diminish the inevitable distraction of the
Executive by virtue of the personal uncertainties and risks
created by a pending or threatened Change in Control and to
encourage the Executive's full attention and dedication to
Standard currently and in the event of any threatened or pending
Change in Control, and to provide the Executive with compensation
and benefits arrangements upon a Change in Control which ensure
that the compensation and benefits expectations of the Executive
will be satisfied and which are competitive with those of other
corporations.

     NOW THEREFORE, in consideration of the premises and mutual
covenants contained herein, and intending to be legally bound
hereby, the parties hereto agree as follows:

     1.  Term.  This Agreement shall be for a three (3) year
period commencing on the date first set forth above and shall be
automatically renewed on the first and on each subsequent annual
anniversary of the above day and month ("Annual Renewal Date")
for a period ending three (3) years from each Annual Renewal Date
unless either party shall give written notice of non-renewal at
least sixty (60) days prior to the Annual Renewal Date.
     
     2.  Change in Control.  As used in this Agreement, Change in
Control shall mean the occurrence of any of the following:
          (a)  any "person" or "group" (as those terms are
defined or used in Section 13(d) of the Securities Exchange Act
of 1934 (the "Exchange Act"), as enacted and in force on the date
hereof) is or becomes the "beneficial owner" (as that term is
defined in Rule 13d-3 under the Exchange Act, as enacted and in
force on the date hereof) of securities of the Company
representing 24.99% or more of the combined voting power of the
Company's securities then outstanding;
          (b)  there occurs a merger, consolidation, share
exchange, division or other reorganization involving the Company
and another entity in which Company shareholders do 
     not continue to hold a majority of the capital stock of the 
     resulting entity, or a sale, exchange, transfer, or other
                                    -2-
     disposition of substantially all of the assets of the  
Company to another entity or other person; or
          (c)  there occurs a contested proxy solicitation or 
     solicitations of the Company's shareholders which results in
     the contesting party or parties obtaining the ability to
     elect a majority of the members of the Board of Directors
     standing for election at one or more meetings of the
     Company's shareholders.

     3.  Triggering Events.  If a Change in Control shall occur
and if thereafter, at any time during the term of this Agreement
there shall be:
          (a)  any involuntary termination of the Executive by 
     Standard, other than for Cause as defined in Section 4
     below;
          (b)  any reduction in the Executive's title,
responsibilities, including reporting responsibilities, or
authority, including such title, responsibilities, or authority
as such may be increased from time to time during the term of
this Agreement;
          (c)  the assignment to the Executive of duties
inconsistent with the Executive's office as such duties existed
on the day immediately prior to the date of a Change in Control;
          (d)  any reduction in the Executive's annual base 
     salary in effect on the day immediately prior to the date of
     a Change in Control;
                                    -3-
          (e)  any failure to continue the Executive's 
participation, on substantially similar terms, in any incentive
compensation or bonus plans of Standard in which the Executive
participated in immediately prior to the Change in Control, or
any change or amendment to any of the substantive provisions of
any of such plans which would materially decrease the potential
benefits to the Executive under any of such plans;
          (f)  any failure to provide the Executive with benefits
     at least as favorable as those enjoyed by the Executive
     under any pension, life insurance, medical, health and
     accident, disability or other employee plans of Standard in
     which the Executive participated in immediately prior to the
     time of the Change in Control, or the taking of any action
     that would materially reduce any of such benefits in effect
     at the time of the Change in Control, unless such reduction
     relates to a reduction in benefits applicable to all
     employees generally; or
          (g)  any breach of any provision of this Agreement by   
     the Company or Standard, which breach shall not have been
     cured by the Company or Standard within thirty (30) days of
     the Company's receipt from the Executive or his agent of
     written notice specifying in reasonable detail the nature of
     the Company's or Standard's breach;
                                    -4-
then Executive, at his sole discretion, may upon no less than 
ninety (90) days written notice to Company, resign from
employment with Standard (or, if involuntarily terminated, give
notice of intention to collect benefits under this Agreement) by
delivering written notice to the Company at any time during the
term of this Agreement.

     4.  Termination of Executive for Cause.  Upon or following a
Change in Control, the Company or Standard shall have the right
at any time to terminate the Executive's employment for Cause. 
In such event, the Company shall give prompt notice to the
Executive, specifying in reasonable detail the basis for such
termination.  For purposes of this Agreement, "Cause" shall mean
the following conduct of the Executive:
          (a)  Material breach of any provision of this
Agreement, which breach Executive shall have failed to cure
within thirty (30) days after Employee's receipt of written
notice from the Company specifying the specific nature of the
Executive's breach;
          (b)  Willful misconduct of Executive that is materially
     inimical to the best interests, monetary or otherwise, of
     the Company or Standard;
          (c)  Conviction of a felony or of any crime involving 
     moral turpitude, fraud or deceit;
          (d)  Adjudication as a bankrupt under the United States
     Bankruptcy Code.
                                    -5-
     5.  Compensation and Benefits.  Upon the occurrence of an
event set forth in Section 3 hereof and the delivery of a notice
of termination to the Company pursuant to Section 3 hereof, the
Executive shall be absolutely entitled to receive the
compensation and benefits set forth below:
          (a)  the Executive shall select, in his absolute
discretion, and receive either (i) monthly installments equal to
one thirty-sixth (1/36) of an amount equal to 2.99 times the
following:  (x) During the initial three-year term of this
Agreement (the "Initial Term") commencing on the date hereof, the
highest combined base salary and bonus paid or payable to the
Executive in the then current year or in any one of the last five
fiscal years preceding the Executive's delivery of a notice of
termination; or (y) After the expiration of the Initial Term, the
quotient obtained by dividing the sum of the Executive's combined
salary and bonuses in the five years preceding the Executive's
delivery of a notice of termination by five, such monthly
installments shall be payable for a period of one year (the
"Payment Period") commencing on the first day of the first
calendar month after Executive's delivery of notice of
termination, or (ii) a one time lump sum payment equal to the
non-discounted sum of the twelve (12) monthly payments provided
for in Section 5(a)(i) immediately above;
          (b)  from the date of the notice of termination through
     and including the last day of the Payment Period, the 
                                    -6-
     Executive shall be entitled to continue to participate in
     the employee retirement plan(s) of the Company and any
     supplemental executive retirement plan(s) (including
deferred profit sharing plan) or other plan in effect during the
term of this Agreement designed to supplement payments made under
such employee retirement plan, as the case may be, as if the
Executive's employment had not terminated;
          (c)  from the date of the notice of termination through
     and including the last day of the Payment Period, the
     Executive shall be provided with life, disability, and
     medical insurance benefits at levels equivalent to the
     highest levels in effect for the Executive during any one of
     the three (3) calendar years preceding the year in which the
     notice of termination is delivered; and
          (d)  on the date of the notice of termination, all 
     options held by the Executive to acquire common stock of the
     Company, to the extent not immediately exercisable by their
     terms, shall become immediately exercisable, and such
     options shall be exercisable by the Executive at any time
     prior to the earlier of the expiration date(s) of such stock
     options or the date which is ninety (90) days after the
     Executive's termination of employment with the Company.
     In the event the Executive is ineligible to continue
participation in the employee retirement plan of Standard and/or
any supplemental executive retirement plan (including deferred
profit sharing plan) or other plan in effect during the 
                                    -7-
term of this Agreement designed to supplement payments made under
such employee retirement plan or in any of Standard's life,
disability or medical insurance plans or programs, the Company
shall, in lieu of such participation, pay the Executive a dollar
amount equal to the dollar amount of the benefit forfeited by the
Executive as a result of such ineligibility or a dollar amount
equal to the cost to the Executive to obtain such benefits in the
case of any life, disability or medical insurance plans or
programs.

     6.  Beneficiary.  Should the Executive die after entitlement
but prior to payment in full of amounts due pursuant to Section
5(a)(i) hereof, such monthly payments shall continue (if such
payment option was so elected by Executive) to the Executive's
designated beneficiary or his estate until such entitlement has
been paid in full.

     7.  Employment at Will.  This Agreement contains the entire
understanding of the Company and the Executive with respect to
the subject matter hereof and, subject to the provisions of any
other agreement between the Executive and the Company, the
Executive shall remain an employee at will and nothing herein
shall confer upon the Executive any right to continued employment
and shall not affect the right of Standard to terminate the
Executive for any reason not prohibited by law; provided,
however, that any such removal shall be without prejudice to any
rights the Executive may have to compensation and benefits as 
provided for in Section 5 hereof.
                                    -8-
     8.  Arbitration.  Except as otherwise provided herein, in
the event of any controversy, dispute or claim arising out of, or
relating to this Agreement, or the breach thereof, the parties
may seek recourse only for temporary or preliminary injunctive
relief to the courts having jurisdiction thereof.  If any relief
other than injunctive relief is sought, the Company and the
Executive agree that such underlying controversy, dispute or
claim shall be settled by arbitration conducted in Pittsburgh,
Pennsylvania in accordance with this Section 8 and the Commercial
Arbitration Rules of the American Arbitration Association
("AAA").  The matter shall be heard and decided, and awards
rendered, by a panel of three (3) arbitrators (the "Arbitration
Panel").  The Company and Executive shall each select one
arbitrator from the AAA National Panel of Commercial Arbitrators
(the "Commercial Panel") and AAA shall select a third arbitrator
from the Commercial Panel.  The award rendered by the Arbitration
Panel shall be final and binding as between the parties hereto
and their heirs, executors, administrators, successors and
assigns, and judgment on the award may be entered by any court
having jurisdiction thereof.  Each party shall pay their
professional fees, expenses and costs incurred in connection with
the resolution of any controversy, dispute or claim arising out
of, or relating to this Agreement.

     9.  Assignment.  This Agreement shall be binding upon and
inure to the benefit of the successors and assigns of the
Company, and the Company shall require any successor to expressly
                                    -9-
acknowledge and assume its obligations hereunder.  This Agreement
shall be void and no further force and effect upon the Company's
sale of all the voting stock or assets of Standard to an
unrelated third party, except if it is reasonably demonstrated
such sale was at the request of a third party who has taken steps
reasonably calculated to effect a Change in Control or such sale
otherwise arose in connection with or in anticipation of a Change
in Control.  This Agreement shall inure to the extent provided
hereunder to the benefit of and be enforceable by the Executive
or his/her legal representatives, executors, administrators,
successors, heirs, distributees, devisees and legatees.  The
Executive may not delegate any of his/her duties,
responsibilities, obligations or positions hereunder to any
person and any such purported delegation by him/her shall be void
and of no force and effect.

     10.  Prior Termination.  Anything in this Agreement to the
contrary notwithstanding, if the Executive's employment with 
Standard is terminated prior to the date on which a Change in
Control occurs either (a) by the Company or Standard other than
for Cause or (b) by the Executive for any one of the reasons set
forth in Section 3 hereof, and it is reasonably demonstrated that
such termination of employment (i) was at the request of a third
party who has taken steps reasonably calculated to effect the
Change in Control or (ii) otherwise arose in connection with or 
                                   -10-
anticipation of the Change in Control, then for all purposes of
this Agreement the termination shall deemed to have occurred upon
a Change in Control and the Executive will be entitled to the 
compensation and benefits provided for in Section 5 hereof.

     11.  Release.  The Executive hereby acknowledges and agrees
that prior to the occurrence of the Executive's or his
dependent's right to receive from the Company or any of its
representatives or agents any compensation or benefit to be paid
or provided to him or his dependents pursuant to Section 5 of
this Agreement, the Executive may be required by the Company, in
its sole discretion, to execute a release in a form reasonably
acceptable to the Company, which releases any and all claims the
Executive has or may have against the Company or its
subsidiaries, agents, officers, directors, successors or assigns.

     12.  Compliance with Laws.  The parties hereto acknowledge
and agree that this Agreement and each party's enforcement of
their rights hereunder are subject to the Comprehensive Thrift
and Bank Fraud Prosecutions Act of 1990 (12 USC 1828) as enacted
and in force on the date hereof.

     13.  Notice.  Any notice required or permitted to be given
under this Agreement shall be sufficient if in writing, and if
personally delivered or when sent by first class certified or
registered mail, postage prepaid, return receipt requested -- in
the case of the Executive, to his residence address as set forth
below, and in the case of the Company, to the address of its 
                                   -11-
principal place of business, in care of the Board -- or to such
other person or at such other address with respect to each party
as such party shall notify the other in writing.
     
     IN WITNESS WHEREOF, the parties have executed this Agreement
as of the date first above written.
