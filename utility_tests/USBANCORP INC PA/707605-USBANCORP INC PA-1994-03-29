PART I

ITEM 1. BUSINESS

General
USBANCORP, Inc. (the "Company") is a registered bank holding company organized
under the Pennsylvania Business Corporation Law and is registered under the 
Bank Holding Company Act of 1956, as amended (the "BHCA.") The Company became a
holding company upon acquiring all of the outstanding shares of United States 
National Bank in Johnstown ("U.S. Bank") on January 5, 1983. The Company also 
acquired all of the outstanding shares of Three Rivers Bank and Trust Company
("Three Rivers Bank") in June 1984, McKeesport National ("McKeesport Bank")
on December 1, 1985 (which was subsequently merged into Three Rivers Bank),
and Community Bancorp, Inc. (whose sole direct subsidiary is Community Savings
Bank) in March 1992. In addition, the Company formed United Bancorp Life 
Insurance Company ("United Life") in October 1987 and USBANCORP Trust Company 
(the "Trust Company") in October 1992. The Company's principal activities 
consist of owning and operating its five wholly-owned subsidiary entities. At 
December 31, 1993, the Company had, on a consolidated total assets, deposits,
and stockholders' equity of $1.24 billion, $1.05 billion and $117 million,
respectively.  
     The Company and the subsidiary entities derive substantially all their
income from banking and bank-related services. The Company functions primarily
as a coordinating and servicing unit for its subsidiary entities in general 
management, credit policies and procedures, accounting and taxes, loan 
review, auditing, investment advisory, compliance, marketing, insurance risk
management, general corporate services, and financial and strategic planning.
     The Company, as a bank holding company, is regulated under the BHCA, and
is supervised by the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (the
"Board.") In general, the Act limits the business of bank holding companies 
to owning or controlling banks and engaging in such other activities as the 
Board may determine to be so closely related to banking or managing or 
controlling banks as to be a proper incident thereto.

USBANCORP Banking Subsidiaries:

U.S. Bank
U.S. Bank is a national banking association organized under the laws of the
United States.  Through 17 locations in Cambria, Clearfield, Somerset, and 
Westmoreland Counties, Pennsylvania, U.S. Bank conducts a general banking 
business. It is a full-service bank offering (i) retail banking services, 
such as demand, savings and time deposits, money market accounts, secured and 
unsecured loans, mortgage loans, safe deposit boxes, holiday club accounts,
collection services, money orders, and traveler's checks; (ii) lending,
depository and related financial services to commercial, industrial, financial,
and governmental customers, such as real estate-mortgage loans, short- and 
medium-term loans, revolving credit arrangements, lines of credit, inventory
and accounts receivable financing, personal and commercial property lease
financing, real estate-construction loans, business savings accounts, 
certificates of deposit, wire transfers, night depository, and lock box 
services; and (iii) credit card operations through MasterCard and VISA. U.S.
Bank also operates 16 automated bank teller machines ("ATM") through its 24
Hour Banking Network which is linked with MAC and HONOR, regional ATM 
networks, and CIRRUS, a national ATM network.

<PAGE>61


     U.S. Bank's deposit base is such that loss of one depositor or a related
group of depositors would not have a materially adverse effect on its 
business. In addition, the loan portfolio is also diversified so that one 
industry or group of related industries does not comprise a material portion
of the loan portfolio.

     U.S. Bank's business is not seasonal nor does it have any risks attendant
to foreign sources.

     Since U.S. Bank is federally chartered, it is subject to primary
supervision of the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency. U.S. Bank is also
subject to the regulations of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve 
Bank and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation.

The following is a summary of key data and ratios at December 31, 1993:

locations in Allegheny and Washington Counties, Pennsylvania, Three Rivers 
Bank conducts a general retail banking business consisting of granting 
commercial, consumer, construction, mortgage and student loan and offering
checking, interest bearing demand, savings and time deposit services. It also
operates 12 ATMs which are affiliated with MAC, a regional ATM network, and
Plus System, a national ATM network. Three Rivers Bank also offers wholesale 
banking services to other banks, merchants, governmental units, and other large
commercial accounts. Such services include balancing services, lock box 
accounts, and providing coin and currency. Three Rivers Bank has an 
arrangement with Statewide Security Transport, Inc. (which conducts business
under the name of Landmark Security Transport) pursuant to which it also 
provides cash collection and deposit services to its customers.

     Three Rivers Bank's deposit base is such that loss of one depositor or a
related group of depositors would not have a materially adverse effect on its 
business.   In addition, the loan portfolio is also diversified so that one 
industry or group  of related industries does not comprise a material portion
of the loan portfolio.

     As a state chartered, federally-insured bank and trust company which is
not a member of the Federal Reserve System, Three Rivers Bank is subject to 
supervision and regular examination by the Pennsylvania Department of Banking 
and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation.  Various federal and state 
laws and regulations govern many aspects of its banking operations.

Community                          
As part of the Company's strategy of expanding in suburban Pittsburgh, in
March 1992, USBANCORP acquired Community Bancorp, Inc., a bank holding 
company regulated under the BHCA and supervised by the Federal Reserve Board, 
and its sole direct subsidiary, Community Savings Bank ("Community.")

     Community is a Pennsylvania-chartered savings bank registered under the
Pennsylvania Banking Code. Community currently conducts its banking operation 
through 12 locations in Allegheny, Washington, and Westmoreland Counties, 
Pennsylvania. Traditionally, Community originated and held fixed-rate 
residential mortgage loans which were funded primarily by certificates of 
deposit and offered a few fee-based services. Under the direction of personnel
transferred to Community from U.S. Bank and Three Rivers Bank, Community has
begun the process of expanding its product offerings through the introduction 
of commercial lending and expanded consumer lending and deposit gathering in 
order to position it as a full-service community bank.


     As part of the Community Acquisition, USBANCORP acquired Community's
direct subsidiaries: Community First Capital Corporation (a special purpose
finance subsidiary), Community First Financial Corporation (a subsidiary 
engaged in real estate joint ventures with assets totalling $1.2 million), 
and Frontier Consumer Discount Company. In accordance with Federal Reserve 
policy, USBANCORP has committed to divest its equity investment in Community
First Financial Corporation within two years of the date of the Community
Acquisition, or such longer period as the Federal Reserve Board may approve.

<PAGE>63

     Community's deposit base is such that loss of one depositor or a related
group of depositors would not have a materially adverse effect on its business.
In addition, the loan portfolio contains a high portion of residential mortgage
and consumer loans that have less credit risk associated with them. In addition,
the loan portfolio is also diversified so that one industry or group of related 
industries does not comprise a material portion of the loan portfolio.

     Community's business is not seasonal nor does it have any risks attendant
to foreign sources.

     As a Pennsylvania-chartered, federally-insured savings bank that is not a
member of the Federal Reserve System, Community Savings Bank is subject to 
supervision and regular examination by the Pennsylvania Department of Banking 
and the FDIC. Various federal and state laws and regulations also govern many 
aspects of its banking and bank-related operations.

     The following is a summary of key data and ratios at December 31, 1993:

Rivers Bank since January 1985. He joined Three Rivers Bank as President on 
August 1, 1984. Mr. Tyson has served as President and Chief Executive Officer 
of Community since 1969 and Community Bancorp, Inc. since 1988. Mr. Fantaski 
was named Chief Executive Officer of Community in March 1993. Prior to 
joining Community, Mr. Fantaski was Senior Vice President and head of retail
banking at U.S. Bank from 1988 through 1991.

Monetary Policies
Commercial banks are affected by policies of various regulatory authorities
including the Federal Reserve System. An important function of the Federal 
Reserve System is to regulate the national supply of bank credit. Among the
instruments of monetary policy used by the Board of Governors are: open 
market operations in U.S. Government securities, changes in discount rate on
member bank borrowings, and changes in reserve requirements on bank deposits.
These means are used in varying combinations to influence overall growth of 
bank loans, investments, and deposits, and may also affect interest rate 
charges on loans or interest paid for deposits. The monetary policies of the
Board of Governors have had a significant effect on the operating results
of commercial banks in the past and are expected to continue to do so in the
future. In view of changing conditions in the national economy and the money 
markets (as well as the effect of actions by

<PAGE>65


monetary and fiscal authorities including the Board of Governors), no
prediction can be made as to possible future changes in interest rates, 
deposit levels or loan demand, or as to the impact of such changes on the 
business and earnings of the Company and its subsidiary entities.

Competition
The subsidiary entities face strong competition from other commercial banks,
savings banks, savings and loan associations, and several other financial or 
investment service institutions for business in the communities they serve. 
Several of these institutions are affiliated with major banking and financial 
institutions, such as Mellon Bank Corporation and PNC Financial Corporation,
which are substantially larger and have greater financial resources than the
subsidiary entities.

     As the financial services industry continues to consolidate, the scope of
potential competition affecting the subsidiary entities will also increase. 
For most of the services that the subsidiary entities perform, there is also 
competition from credit unions and issuers of commercial paper and money 
market funds. Such institutions, as well as brokerage house consumer finance
companies, factors, insurance companies, and pension trusts, are important
competitors for various types of financial services. In addition, personal 
and corporate trust investment counseling services are offered by insurance 
companies, other firms, and individuals.

Market Area
The Company, headquartered in Johnstown, Pennsylvania, operates through 41
branch offices in six southwestern Pennsylvania counties with a combined 
population of approximately 2.2 million: Allegheny, Cambria, Clearfield, 
Somerset, Washington, and Westmoreland. With the acquisition of four Integra 
branches, the Company's Community and Three Rivers bank subsidiaries have a
combined 24 offices and $700 million asset presence in the Western Region,
largely comprised of the Greater Pittsburgh marketplace.

     The economy of western Pennsylvania continues to experience modest
expansion, but at a slower pace than the nation-at-large. Retail sales, 
durable goods orders, and consumer real estate activity continue to foster 
the expansion. Correspondingly, the statewide seasonally adjusted
unemployment rate for December 1993 fell to 5.8%, representing a 1%
improvement from the adjusted December 1992 unemployment rate. The Company 
believes that as the economy continues to expand the conditions in the state 
will slowly improve throughout 1994.

     The Greater Johnstown economy improved at a slightly faster pace. The
unemployment rate declined 1.9% to 9.0% at December 1993 when compared to the 
December 1992 rate.  Economic news continues to be encouraging for the region 
with slow expansion firmly imbedded.  The modernization planned by Veritas 
Capital, Inc. in the purchase plan of Bethlehem Steel's Johnstown mills is 
progressing. The project could make the Bar, Rod, and Wire mill a
state-of-the-art facility in the industry and enhance employment in the region
by 1,200 or 1.3% within four or five years. Diversification continues to be a 
key element to the community's growth. The opening of several new businesses 
and facilities has benefited the area by shifting the area's focus from the 
historic over-reliance on heavy industry to more light manufacturing and
service related businesses. Examples of this would include the National Drug
Intelligence Center which brought 150 new jobs to the area and expected growth
at Laurel Technologies, Concurrent Technologies, Johnstown Wire Technologies, 
and others which are anticipated to generate approximately 200 new jobs in 1994.
This diversification of the local economy is further exemplified by the nature 
of the ten largest non-

<PAGE>66


government employers in the region which include: three hospitals; a
state-wide electric utility; a regional food retailer; a steel manufacturer; a 
ladies apparel manufacturer; a national life insurance company; and a long
distance trucking company.

     The suburban Pittsburgh market area, where Three Rivers Bank and
Community operate, is anticipated to benefit from the planned Station Square 
Expansion Project set to begin in March 1994. This project will develop a $4.1
million park on 2.5 acres at Station Square. Armco, Inc. announced plans to 
recapitalize its carbon steel venture with Kawasaki Steel Corporation by
selling $590 million in new stock and debt. USX announced that it also will
test the investor market for steel by issuing 4.5 million shares of common 
stock. This interest in capital creation clearly shows expansion potential in 
the region. It is also expected that the completed expansion and 
modernization of the new Pittsburgh International Airport known as "Midfield
Terminal" will continue to contribute to growth in the economy. The economy
is generally well diversified as exemplified by the ten largest non-government 
employers in the region which include: two hospitals; USAir; the University of 
Pittsburgh; Westinghouse; two money center banks; USX Corporation; a multi-
state grocery retailer; and a multi-state restaurant chain.

     The Company believes that the state and regional economy will continue
its diversification and show improvement throughout 1994. Consequently, the 
Company's marketplace should continue to display modest strengthening.

Employees
The Company employed approximately 773 persons as of December 31, 1993, in
full and part-time positions. Approximately 213 non-supervisory employees of 
U.S. Bank are represented by a union. U.S. Bank and such employees are 
parties to a labor contract pursuant to which employees have agreed not to 
engage in any work stoppage during the term of the contract which will 
expire on October 15, 1994. U.S. Bank has not experienced a work stoppage
since 1979.  Management considers relations with employees to be satisfactory.

Commitments and Lines of Credit
The Company's banking subsidiaries are obligated under commercial, standby,
and trade-related irrevocable letters of credit aggregating $5.4 million at 
December 31, 1993.  In addition, the subsidiary banks have issued lines of 
credit to customers generally for periods of up to one year.  Borrowings 
under such lines of credit are usually for the working capital needs of the
borrower.  At December 31, 1993, the Company's banking subsidiaries had unused 
loan commitments of approximately $168 million.

Investment Portfolio
Effective September 30, 1992, USBANCORP designated the entire investment
securities portfolio as "available for sale." All or part of these "available 
for sale" assets may be sold at any time for interest rate, prepayment, credit,
or liquidity considerations and other factors as deemed appropriate by 
management. These assets are carried on the balance sheet at the lower of their
aggregate amortized cost or market value. Any unrealized net valuation
adjustments will be included in USBANCORP's income statement. While designation
of these assets as "available for sale" may increase income volatility for 
financial reporting purposes, management believes designation of these assets 
as "available for sale" permits USBANCORP to react more quickly to changing
market conditions and opportunities and more effectively interest rate risk. 
(See Investment Securities Available for Sale Policy on page 18 for further
discussion of SFAS #115 impact).

     The following table sets forth the book and market value of USBANCORP's
investment portfolio as of the periods indicated:

<FN>
*At December 31, 1993, approximately 95% of these obligations represented U.S.
Agency issued securities.
</TABLE>

     The $61.8 million increase in total investment securities was due
entirely to the redeployment of a significant portion of the $88 million of
acquired Integra deposits and the $24.6 million of funds from the secondary 
market common stock issuance into the securities portfolio.  Within the 
portfolio, the decline in other securities reflects a shift emphasis towards
mortgage-backed securities and collateralized mortgage obligations which
provide a recurrent source of cash flow.

     The book value of total investment securities increased from $289.8
million at December 31, 1991, to $366.9 million at December 31, 1992. The
increase in the total investment securities was due to the inclusion of $82.9 
million of Community's investment securities which included the securities
purchased with approximately $30 million of proceeds from of fixed-rate
mortgage loans. This increase was partially offset by the cash payment made by
USBANCORP to shareholders of the parent of Community, a reduction in interest 
bearing deposits at other institutions, and the continued rapid paydown of
mortgage-backed securities in a low interest rate environment.

<PAGE>68


     At December 31, 1993, investment securities having a book value of $83.8
million were pledged as collateral for public funds and other purposes as 
required by law.

     The Company and its subsidiaries, collectively, did not hold securities
of any single issuer, excluding U.S. Treasury and U.S. Agencies, that exceeded 
10% of stockholders' equity at December 31, 1993.

     Maintaining investment quality is a primary objective of the Company's
investment policy which, subject to certain minor exceptions, prohibits the 
purchase of any investment security below a Moody's Investor Service or 
Standard & Poor's rating of "A." At December 31, 1993, 89.2% of the portfolio 
was rated "AAA" and 91.0% was rated at least "AA" as compared to 85.4% and 
86.5%, respectively, at December 31, 1992. Only 3.2% of the portfolio was rated
below "A" or unrated at December 31, 1993.

     The following table sets forth the contractual maturity distribution of
the investment securities available for sale, book and market values, and the 
weighted average yield for each type and range of maturity as of December 31, 
1993. Yields, which are not presented on a tax-equivalent basis, are based upon
book value and are weighted for the scheduled maturity.  Average maturities 
are based upon the original contractual maturity dates with the exception of
collateralized mortgage obligations and asset-backed securities for which the
average lives were used. Also, where applicable, put-option dates were used as 
the maturity dates. At December 31, 1993, USBANCORP's consolidated investment 
securities available for sale had an average contractual maturity of 
approximately 10.70 years and an average cash flow payback of approximately 
2.81 years. However, as previously discussed, any security may be sold prior to
contractual maturity at the discretion of management.

     During both 1993 and 1992, the Company sold approximately $22 million and
$32 million, respectively, of investment securities available for sale which 
resulted in the recognition of net investment security gains of $583,000 and 
$393,000 respectively. These gains resulted primarily from the execution of 
several investment strategies to capture available market premiums on
mortgage-backed securities which had the characteristics of low remaining
balances and fast prepayment histories.

*The historical information for this category was not available.
</TABLE>

     From December 31, 1992, to December 31, 1993, loans increased by $72.2
million or 10.9% from $659.8 million to $732.0 million. As a result of the low 
rate environment, less inflationary fears, and a moderate economic recovery, 
each of the Company's banking subsidiaries experienced heightened loan demand 
in 1993. Within the loan portfolio, each of the major loan categories 
experienced growth in the following amounts since December 31, 1992:
commercial loans up by $22.7 million or 29.5%, real estate-mortgage loans up by
$39.8 million or 13.3%, consumer loans up by $9.5 million or 6.0%, and 
commercial loans secured by real estate up by $200,000 or only .2%. The 
commercial loan growth resulted from successful business development efforts 
in both regions of the Company's marketplace which includes suburban 
Pittsburgh and Greater Johnstown. The net growth in mortgage loans (including 
home equity) occurred despite the sale of approximately $22 million of 30-year 
fixed-rate product that originated during 1993. The majority of the mortgage
growth occurred at Community with approximately 60% of this growth related to 
refinancing activity with new customers.  The net growth of consumer loans 
outstanding is noteworthy since it represents a significant reversal of the 
trend of net consumer loan run-off which had occurred throughout 1992. 
Improved consumer demand, acquisition of Integra loans, and heavy marketing of 
debt consolidation loans, combined with a general stabilizing of indirect auto 
loan run-off, were the factors responsible for the increase in consumer loan
balances outstanding.  

     From December 31, 1991, to December 31, 1992, loans increased by $213.3
million or 47.8% from $446.5 million to $659.8 million. This increase in the 
loan portfolio was due to the inclusion of Community's $238.4 million loan 
portfolio. Without Community, USBANCORP's loan portfolio decreased from $446.5 
million on December 31, 1991, to $421.4 million on December 31, 1992. The 
decline in the loan portfolio was due to the softness in consumer and
commercial demand.

     The loan maturity information is based upon original loan terms and is
not adjusted for "rollovers." In the ordinary course of business, loans 
maturing within one year may be renewed, in whole or in part, as to principal 
amount at interest rates prevailing at the date of renewal.

     At December 31, 1993, 71.6% of total loans were fixed-rate compared to
75.0% at December 31, 1992. This decrease was due to a combination of growth
experienced in floating rate commercial loans and management's ongoing effort
to continue to diversify Community's loan portfolio by selling new 30-year 
fixed-rate mortgage loans. During 1993, $22 million of this type of loan 
product was sold. For additional information regarding intesest sensitivity,

and Results of Operations--Interest Rate Sensitivity."

</TABLE>
<PAGE>71

     The Company's deposits increased on average in 1993 by $113.8 million or
12.5% due entirely to the $88 million of acquired Integra deposits and the 
inclusion of Community's deposits for the entire year. Trends noted within the 
deposit portfolio included increased customer preference in the low rate 
environment for money market, savings, and NOW account deposits.  Although 
these types of core deposit balances are more liquid and sensitive than 
certificates of deposit, they do provide a relatively stable and less costly
source of funding for the earning asset base than do certificates of deposit. 
Overall, the core deposit base is stable as approximately 97% of total deposits
are considered core accounts. The remaining 3% are certificates of deposit
over $100,000. The Company does not use any volatile funding sources such as
brokered deposits.

     The following table indicates the maturities and amounts of certificates
of deposit issued in denominations of $100,000 or more as of December 31, 1993:

MESSAGE TO THE
SHAREHOLDER

Dear Shareholder:

Building upon success was the challenge your management team faced when
entering 1993. Time is proving that our steady and consistent approach to
enhancing shareholder value is the best way to ensure continued growth for your
Company. It has been gratifying to reach new goals; and for 1993, we can report
achievements such as increasing earnings, building non-interest income,
generating loan growth, and raising the common dividend. We began 1993 with
challenges and have once again set an elevated standard for 1994.

FINANCIAL AND STRATEGIC HIGHLIGHTS

I am pleased to report that earnings for the year ended December 31, 1993,
reached a record high of $12,488,000 or $2.72 per share on a fully diluted 
basis. Your Company's 1993 net income included a $1,452,000 non-recurring 
federal income tax benefit due to the adoption of Statement of Financial 
Accounting Standards NO.109, "Accounting for Income Taxes."  Before this 
one-time benefit, 1993 net income totaled $11,036,000 or $2.41 per fully 
diluted share compared to reported net income of $8,883,000 or $2.53 for the 
year ended December 31, 1992.

     Your Company's overall improved net income in 1993 included a consistent
uptrending of quarterly earnings during the year. This pattern of increased 
core earnings growth reflects improved performance in several key areas:

- -    Non-interest income for the full year ended December 31, 1993, was
$10,150,000 and reflects an approximate 22% growth over 1992. This key area of
primarily non-interest sensitive fee income includes enhanced earnings from 
trust income, deposit service charges, wholesale cash processing operations,
and gains from fixed-rate mortgage loan sales. The performance of our Trust 
Company is particularly noteworthy as it continued its profitable expansion 
throughout western Pennsylvania including the Greater Pittsburgh marketplace.
Specifically, trust assets (both discretionary an non-discretionary) totaled
$943 million at December 31, 1993, an increase of 45% since the prior year end.

- -    Strong loan growth was experienced at each of the banking subsidiaries
during 1993.  Total loans outstanding equaled $727 million at December 31, 1993,
representing an increase of $78 million or 12% from the December 31, 1992, 
level. Your Company's balance sheet liquidity will continue to provide the 
banking subsidiaries with the financial capacity to profitably fund these 
growing customer borrowing needs, a result of the current modest economic 
recovery which is anticipated to gain momentum during 1994.

- -    Your Company's asset quality continues to be a source of strength. Even
with the loan growth mentioned above, total non-performing assets declined 
during 1993 and totaled only $6.5 million or .89% of total loans at December 31,
1993. For each non-accrual loan dollar, our management maintained a loan loss
reserve of $2.88 at year end.

- -    A continued diligent focus on controlling and reducing non-interest
expense, combined with the growth in non-interest income discussed earlier, 
resulted in the Company's net overhead to average assets ratio declining from 
2.68% in 1992 to a record low of 2.51% in 1993. The Company's net overhead to 
net interest income ratio also showed comparable improvement as it declined 
from 62.80% in 1992 to 61.80% in 1993. The successful conversion to one
centralized data processing 

<PAGE>5

system for the Western Region in the fourth quarter of 1993 was one example of 
a significant economy of scale benefit achieved by yout Company, which will
generate annual pre-tax savings approximating $300,000 beginning in 1994. Your
Company's management is committed to further reducing the net overhead to net
interest income ratio to its long-term strategic plan goal of 55% and will 
continue to make progress in this goal achievement during 1994. Due to economy
of scale benefits, such as this conversion, each of our two subsidiaries in 
the Western Region should be below the 55% goal by year-end 1994.

     Along with this improved core financial performance, your Company was
also able to achieve several long-term strategic successes during 1993. 
Foremost among these successes was an over-subscribed secondary offering of 
1,150,000 new common shares at a price of $24.50 which generated net proceeds 
to your Company of approximately $26 million.  Management had expected to 
utilize the majority of these new funds to retire the Company's outstanding 
preferred stock. Since preferred shareholders elected to convert 90% of the 
outstanding preferred stock into the Company's common stock, however, there was
a need for only $1.4 million of cash to redeem the unconverted preferred shares.
Additionally, $2 million of the offering proceeds was downstreamed as a 
capital infusion into Three Rivers Bank in connection with the acquisition of
the Integra branches to adequately capitalize the deposits acquired.
Consequently, the retention of the majority of the funds from the secondary 
offering allowed our common stock market capitalization to reach approximately 
$117 million--a level well above the $100 million benchmark at which we receive
much heightened following and purchase interest in our common stock by
institutional owners and nationally recognized bank stock analysts. Your
Company will continue to make diligent efforts to look for ways to better 
leverage this capital strength in 1994. Possible alternatives include the 
acquisition of a whole organization--such as the Johnstown Savings Bank
acquisition which is expected to be consummated by the end of the second
quarter of 1994--or individual branch locations, and a higher dividend payout. 
The Company will also implement its February 25th announced common stock buyback
program to better leverage its capital strength.

     Another key strategic success was the continuation of an increasing
quarterly cash dividend to you our shareholders. As a result of the increased 
core earnings performance, the Board of Directors declared a 10% increase in
the quarterly cash dividend in 1993. This increase to $.22 per share became 
effective for the last three quarters of 1993 and made the total 1993 cash 
dividend $.86 per share compared to $.75 per share in 1992.  This increase
in the dividend, your Company's fifth increase since 1990, is consistent with 
our five-year Capital Plan. This rising common dividend, combined with an 
increase in the market value of our common stock, further demonstrates our 
ongoing commitment to a progressive total shareholder return which amounted
to approximately 11.8% in 1993 compared to a total return for the Standard &
Poor's ("S&P") 500 Index of 10.0%. Interestingly, your Company's total 
shareholder return for the period 1988-1993 was 163.7% compared to the S&P's 
500 Index total return of 125.6%-an historic record of achievement and a 
challenge to better in the future.

PUTTING A STRATEGIC PLAN INTO ACTION FOR OUR CUSTOMERS

At your Company, transforming a strategic plan into quality financial services
and delivering these services through competently trained banking 
professionals is fundamental to the creation of a progressive total 
shareholder return. Successful

<PAGE>6

financial companies incorporate several imperative ingredients that ultimately
lead to business prosperity and shareholder value. These ingredients were 
first outlined in the 1988 Strategic Plan for USBANCORP, Inc.. Today, the 
strategic plan, community involvement, total shareholder return, and quality
customer service are bound together more tightly than ever before. The
fundamental actions inspired by this original strategic plan have become part
of the corporate plans for each of the affiliates. "Doing the little things 
better" has been our abbreviated mission statement for each subsidiary, and 
in 1994 we promise to embellish this theme for each customer--demonstrating 
conclusively that we ultimately deliver the best possible customer service.

     Fundamental to achieving quality customer service is a corporate culture
that gets its strength from shared values, beliefs, expectations, and 
attitudes. Rising from this common focus are customer benefits that will 
continue to position your Company as a leader in the community--both for 
financial services and community involvement. Delivering first rate customer
service during banking transactions is the most obvious element. The leader's 
role also includes an enthusiastic approach towards civic and charitable 
community involvement and the development of new products designed to meet 
the changing needs of our diverse customer base. This active culture of 
community involvement is leading to a more positive image through corporate
sponsorship and employee involvement with civic and charitable organizations.
These organizations are as nationally recognized as the United Way, American 
Red Cross, and chambers of commerce, or more hometown such as the Lawrenceville
Boys and Girls Club, White Oak PTA, Cambria County Meals-On-Wheels, and the 
Coalport VFW Ladies Auxiliary.

     A quality service initiative at U.S. National Bank was in full operation
during 1993. Each employee received an average of 15 hours of quality service 
skills training that not only highlighted more effective external customer 
interaction skills, but also skills that fostered improved internal teamwork.
The internal teamwork element of this quality service program remains 
integral as it leads to a cooperative atmosphere among all employees.  
Together we direct our energies to accomplish a common set of goals at every 
level of the organization. In 1994, this corporate quality service initiative,
while being introduced to our western affiliates, becomes the practice at 
U.S. National Bank. The end result is an employee team trained and motivated 
to live up to the role as a community leader.

     Recognizing the importance of this employee role, your Company has
invested more than 1,000 hours of formal corporate training for management 
and customer service employees at U.S. National Bank. The data center 
conversion involving Three Rivers Bank and Community Savings Bank was a 
success largely due to a comprehensive training program that prepared every
employee for the changes brought on by this consolidation of services. A
unique "Community Conversion College" was attended by all Community Savings 
Bank employees to make them as comfortable as possible with the improved data 
system. In total, Three Rivers Bank and Community Savings Bank invested more
than 1,500 hours of formal training. Your Company also recognizes the 
importance of a sound mind and body. During 1993, the first corporate sponsored
Wellness Program began to encourage employee participation in physical
activity. Two-thirds of all U.S. National Bank employees took advantage of 
one or more of the Wellness Program events in 1993. The program's goal is to 
encourage employees to live healthier lifestyles, both on and off the job, 
ultimately leading to healthier and more productive employees.

PRODUCT AND SERVICE NEWS

An active product support culture is apparent as a result of new product
introductions in 1993 designed to fill customer and social responsibility needs.
We directed specific attention towards products which enhance the 
subsidiaries' presence in the community in 1993.  For example, Three Rivers 
Bank introduced the TRUE Account followed later in the year by National Bank's
First Account and CHAMP Mortgage Loan program. These products include features
such as a basic checking service and affordable loan options, making them 
ideal for approved low-to-moderate income customers. The most recent federal 
banking regulators' reviews prove our success in this area as both Three 
Rivers Bank and U.S. National Bank enter 1994 with an "outstanding" Community 
Reinvestment Act ("CRA") review rating. This is the highest ranking a bank 
can receive for its community involvement and lending practices.

     Another new product introduction was the Tax Advantage Pathroad Account.
This USBANCORP Trust Company service features tax-free investments which are
regularly reviewed and redirected via asset allocation_the investment 
management approach used for the original Pathroad Account. Due in part to 
newly introduced investment products such as the Tax Advantage Pathroad and 
Pathroad Accounts, USBANCORP Trust Company is now beyond the $900 million 
milestone for trust assets under management.

     Consolidation to achieve more cost effectiveness led to the creation of
the combined Three Rivers Bank and Community Savings Bank Retail Loan and 
Operation Centers. Opened in August 1992 at the McKeesport Office, the Retail
Loan Center approves, processes, collects, and maintains files for all direct 
and indirect consumer loans originated at the western affiliates. The Loan 
Center also handles collections for the mortgage loan portfolios at each
institution. The Operation Center, located at the Three Rivers Bank Jefferson 
Borough Office, opened in October 1993 to provide immediate answers to 
customer banking inquiries via a toll-free service number.  Both the Loan and
Operation Centers are consolidating services as a result of the successful 1993
data systems conversion at Community Savings Bank.

     Three Rivers Bank enlarged its branch network with the addition of four
offices of Integra Bank acquired during the first quarter of 1993. The 
offices are located in Glassport, Liberty Borough, Port Vue, and White Oak 
in Allegheny County. The White Oak Office was later consolidated into the 
nearby Rainbow Village Office of Three Rivers Bank. The deposits of the
four acquired offices totalled nearly $90 million. This 1993 acquisition was
valuable to your Company by increasing our presence in the Greater Pittsburgh
suburban area by 20%, at a modest deposit premium price of 1.40%.

     All of our customers enjoy easy access to our products and services
because of improvements made to our facilities in 1993, as our subsidiaries 
worked to achieve compliance with the Americans with Disabilities Act 
("ADA"). The most obvious provision of this government regulation is in the 
area of public accommodations. Bank facilities have been reviewed for 
compliance with the ADA; modifications have been made to accommodate disabled
customers. These modifications include easy access doorways, ramps, and other
facility alterations designed to eliminate barriers for the disabled.

SUCCESSOR MANAGEMENT

In addition to my February 1994 succession of the retired Clifford A. Barton
as chairman, president & CEO, there have been four other notable management 
changes since the beginning of 1993. These changes include:

     Kenneth J. Tyson, president and chief executive officer of Community
Savings Bank, resigned as the bank's CEO in March 1993. Mr. Tyson remained as 
president until his retirement in March 1994.

     Dennis J. Fantaski, executive vice president and chief operating officer,
succeeded Mr. Tyson as CEO and later as president of Community Savings Bank. 
Mr. Fantaski has 16 years of banking experience and has held various 
management positions. He was senior vice president and head of retail banking
at U.S. National Bank, and prior to that Mr. Fantaski held management
positions in residential real estate, personal banking, and corporate banking
at Dollar Bank in Pittsburgh.

     The new U.S. National Bank president and CEO is Louis Cynkar, previously
senior vice president and head of the bank's commercial and retail banking 
units. Mr. Cynkar has more than 30 years of banking experience, 24 of which 
were spent with the former Equibank of Pittsburgh where he rose through the 
ranks to become senior vice president of commercial lending. He joined U.S. 
National Bank in 1986 as senior vice president of commercial lending. In 
1991, he was promoted to senior vice president and head of both the 
commercial and retail banking groups within U.S. National Bank. His thorough 
knowledge of the operation of U.S. National Bank and his devotion to the 
community served by the bank will make for a smooth transition in 1994.

     In February 1994, Orlando B. Hanselman was promoted to executive vice
president, chief financial officer & manager of corporate services within 
USBANCORP. In his new role, Mr. Hanselman is responsible for the direction and
strategic efforts of finance, accounting, investments, marketing, CRA, 
investor relations, and facilities management.  Mr. Hanselman joined the 
holding company in 1987 after five years of public accounting with Price 
Waterhouse in Pittsburgh. In 1989, Mr. Hanselman was promoted to senior vice 
president, treasurer & chief financial officer. Mr. Hanselman has been a 
major contributor to the direction and strength of USBANCORP. His commitment 
to shareholder interests and his diverse talents continue to be valuable 
within the new management team.

     In conclusion, I want to thank our dedicated employees and directors for
their efforts and you, our shareholder, for your support. I would also like 
to express deepest appreciation to Cliff Barton for his seven years of 
dedicated service and visionary leadership. We enjoyed a year of record 
performance in 1993; together we look forward to building up successes of 
our past as we focus on a new year of business and achievement at USBANCORP.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AT AND FOR THE YEARS
ENDED DECEMBER 31, 1993, 1992, AND 1991

1. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

Business:
USBANCORP, Inc. (the "Company") and its subsidiaries' operations relate
primarily to commercial banking activities which represent one industry segment.

Principles of Consolidation:
The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company and
its wholly-owned subsidiaries, United States National Bank in Johnstown ("U.S.
Bank"), Three Rivers Bank and Trust Company ("Three Rivers Bank"), Community
Bancorp, Inc. ("Community"), USBANCORP Trust Company ("Trust Company"), and 
United Bancorp Life Insurance Company ("United Life"). Intercompany accounts
and transactions have been eliminatedin preparing the consolidated financial
statements.

Investment Securities and Investment Securities Available for Sale:
Prior to September 30, 1992, investment securities have been stated at cost
adjusted for amortization of premium and accretion of discount. Both accretion 
and amortization are determined by the straight-line method which is not
materially different from the level yield method. Effective September 30,
1992, the investment portfolio was reclassified as "available for sale." Since
that date, the portfolio has been carried at the lower amortized cost or
market value. Any unrealized adjustments are reflected in "N loss on
investment securities available for sale" on the Consolidated Realized gain
or loss on securities sold is computed based upon the ad securities sold.

     In May 1993, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued Statement of
Financial Accounting Standards ("SFAS") #115, "Accounting for Certain
Investments in Debt and Equity Securities." This Statement addresses the
accounting and reporting for investments in equity securities that have readily
determinable fair values and for all investments in debt securities.
Management does not believe that the adoption of this statement material impact
on the results of operations or the financial positive adoption of this
statement in the first quarter of 1994, management plans to rec tax-free
municipal securities as "held to maturity" and carry them at amortize investment
securities portfolio will continue to be classified as "availibility carried at
market value.

Loans:
Interest income is recognized using methods which approximate a level yield
related to principal amounts outstanding. The subsidiaries immediately
discontinue the accrual of interest income when loans, except for loans that
are insured for credit loss, become 90 days past due in either principal or
interest. In addition, if circumstances warrant, the accural of interest may be
discontinued prior to 90 days. In all cases, payments received loans are
credited to principal until full recovery of principal has after full
recovery of principal that any additional payments received are recognized as
interest income. A non-accrual loan is placed on accrual status after becoming
current and remaining current for twelve consecutive payments (except for
residential mortgage loans which have to become current and remain current for
six consecutive payments) and upon the approval of the Credit Committee
and/or Board Discount/Loan Committee with final approval resting with the
Chief Financial Officer.

Loan Fees:
Loan origination and commitment fees, net of associated direct costs, are
deferred and amortized into interest and fees on loans over the loan or
commitment period. Fee
amortization is determined by either the straight-line method, or the effective
interest method, which do not differ materially.

Fixed-Rate Mortgage Loans Held For Sale:
All newly originated 30-year fixed-rate residential mortgage loans are
classified as "held for sale." It is management's intent to periodically
sell these residential mortgage loans and retain servicing rights for the
remaining lives; this strategy will be executed in an effort to help neutralize
long-term interest rate risk. The residential mortgage loans held for sale are
carried at the lower of aggregate cost or market value. At December 31, 1993,
the cost of these loans approximated market value. Realized gains and losses
will be calculated by the specific identification method and will be included
in "Net realized gain or loss on loans held for sale"; unrealized net
valuation adjustments (if any) will be recorded in "Net unrealized gain or
loss on loans held for sale" on the Consolidated Statement of Income.

Premises and Equipment:
Premises and equipment are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation and
amortization. Depreciation is charged to operations over the estimated useful
lives of the premises and equipment using the straight-line method. Useful
lives of up to 45 years for buildings and up to 12 years for equipment are
utilized. Leasehold improvements are amortized using the straight-line
method over the terms of the respective leases or useful live improvements,
whichever is shorter. Maintenance, repairs, and minor alterations are charged 
to current operations as expenditures are incurred. 

Allowance for Loan Losses and Charge-off Procedures:
As a financial institution which assumes lending and credit risks as a
principal element in its business, the Company anticipates that credit
losses will be experienced in the normal course of business. Accordingly,
management of the Company makes a quarterly determination as to an
appropriate provision from earnings necessary to maintain an allowance for
loan losses which would be adequate for potential yet undetermined losses.
The amount charged against earnings is based upon several factors including, at
a minimum, each of the following:

- -    A continuing review of delinquent, classified and non-performing loans,
					large loans, and overall portfolio quality. This continuous review assesses
				 the risk characteristics of both individual loans and the total loan
				 portfolio.

- -    Regular examinations and reviews of the loan portfolio by representatives
					of the regulatory authorities. 

- -    Analytical review of loan charge-off experience, delinquency rates, and
					other relevant historical and peer statistical ratios.

<PAGE>18

- -    Management's judgment with respect to local and general economic
					conditions and their impact on the existing loan portfolio.

     When it is determined that the prospects of recovery of the principal of
a loan have significantly diminished, the loan is immediately charged against
the allowance account and subsequent recoveries, if any, are credited to the
allowance account. Loans are charged-off promptly upon determination that a loss
is anticipated. In addition, non-accrual and large delinquent loans are reviewed
monthly to determine potential losses. Consumer loans are considered losses when
they are 90 days past due, except loans that are insured for credit loss.

Trust Fees:
All trust fees are recorded on the cash basis which approximates the accrual
basis for such income. 

Earnings Per Common Share:
Primary earnings per share amounts are computed by dividing net income, after
deducting preferred stock dividend requirements, by the weighted average number
of common stock and common stock equivalent shares outstanding. Fully diluted
earnings per share amounts are calculated assuming that the Series A $2.125
Cumulative Convertible Non-Voting Preferred Stock was converted at the
beginning of the year into 1.136 shares of the Company's Common Stock and
that no preferred dividends were paid. By April 7, 1993, a Preferred Stock
was either redeemed or converted to the Company's Common Stock. 

Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows:
On a consolidated basis, cash equivalents include cash and due from banks,
interest bearing deposits with banks, and federal funds sold and securities
purchased under agreements to resell; for the Company, cash equivalents
include short-term investments. The Company made $4,300,000 in federal income
tax payments in 1993; $3,986,000 in 1992; and $3,336,000 in 1991. The Company
made total interest expense payments of $34,153,000 in $40,942,000 in 1992;
and $33,475,000 in 1991.

Income Taxes:
As discussed in Note 13, the Company adopted Statement of Financial Accounting
Standards #109, "Accounting for Income Taxes" in the first quarter of 1993.
Under SFAS #109, deferred tax assets or liabilities are computed based on the
difference between the financial statement and income tax bases of assets and
liabilities using the enacted marginal tax rate. Deferred income tax expenses or
credits are based on the changes in the asset or liability from period to
period. Prior to 1993, deferred income tax expenses or credits were recorded to
reflect the tax consequences of timing differences between the recording of
income and expenses for financial reporting purposes and for purposes of
filing federal income tax returns at income tax rates in effect when the
difference arose.

2. CASH AND DUE FROM BANKS

Cash and due from banks at December 31, 1993, and 1992, included $11,857,000
and $10,384,000, respectively, of reserves required to be maintained under
Federal Reserve Bank regulations.

4. INVESTMENT SECURITIES AND INVESTMENT SECURITIES
   AVAILABLE FOR SALE

Beginning September 30, 1992, the entire investment security portfolio as
described in the table below was reclassified as "available for sale." All or
part of the investment security portfolio may be sold at any time for
interest rate, prepayment, credit, liquidity considerations, or other factors
as determined appropriate by management. The investment security portfolio is
carried at the lower of aggregate amortized cost or market value; any necessary
adjustments are recorded in the Income Statement. Prior to September 30, 1992,
there were no investment securities categorized as "available for sale."

     The book and market values of investment securities "available for sale"
and carried at the lower of amortized cost or market value are summarized as

</TABLE>

     There was no trading within the investment portfolio during the periods
presented. Prior to the Company classifying its investment portfolio as
"available for sale" on September 30, 1992, the Company's policy limited any
investment security sale before its maturity primarily to the infrequent
occurrences which required protection of the investment portfolio quality.
     
     Maintaining investment quality is a primary objective of the Company's
investment policy which, subject to certain limited exceptions, prohibits the
purchase of any investment security below a Moody's Investors Service or
Standard & Poor's rating of "A." At December 31, 1993, 89.2% of the portfolio
was rated "AAA" and 91.0% "AA" or higher as compared to 85.4% and
86.5%, respectively, at December 31, 1992. Only 3.2% of the portfolio was
rated below "A" or unrated on December 31, 1993.

     The book value of securities pledged to secure public and trust deposits,
as required by law, was $83,769,000 at December 31, 1993, and $61,062,000 at
December 31, 1992. The Company realized $827,000 and $472,000 of gross
investment security gains and $244,000 and $79,000 of gross investment security
losses in 1993 and 1992, respectively.


5. LOANS

The loan portfolio of the Company consisted of the following:

</TABLE>

     Real estate construction loans were not material at these presented dates
and comprised 2.5% of total loans net of unearned income at December 31, 1993.
The Company has no credit exposure to foreign countries or highly leveraged
transactions. Additionally, the Company has no significant industry lending
concentrations. 

     In the ordinary course of business, the subsidiaries have transactions,
including loans, with their officers, directors, and their affiliated
companies. These transactions were on substantially the same terms as those
prevailing at the time for comparable transactions with unaffiliated parties
and do not involve more than the normal credit risk. These loans totaled
$15,074,000 and $12,824,000 at December 31, 1993, and 1992, respectively.
An analysis of these related party loans follows:

7. NON-PERFORMING ASSETS

Non-performing assets are comprised of (i) loans which are on a non-accrual
basis, (ii) consumer loans which are contractually past due 90 days or more as
to interest or principal payments and which are insured for credit loss, and
(iii) other real estate owned (real estate acquired through foreclosure and
in-substance foreclosures). All loans, except for loans are insured for credit
loss, are placed on non-accrual status immediately upon becoming 90 days past
due in either principal or interest. In addition, if circumstances warrant, the
accrual of interest may be discontinued prior to 90 days. In all cases,
payments received on non-accrual loans are credited to principal until full
recovery of principal has been recognized; it is only after full recovery of
principal that any additional payments received are recognized as interest
income.

</TABLE>

     All Federal Home Loan Bank stock and an interest in unspecified mortgage
loans, with an aggregate statutory value equal to the amount of the advances,
have been pledged as collateral with the Federal Home Loan Bank of Pittsburgh.

Collateralized Mortgage Obligation:
The collateralized mortgage obligation was issued through Community First
Capital Corporation ("CFCC"), a wholly- owned, single-purpose finance
subsidiary of Community Savings Bank. Community Savings Bank transferred in 1988
Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation ("FHLMC") securities with a book value of
approximately $31,500,000 to CFCC which were then used as collateral for
issuance of bonds with a par value of $27,787,000 in the form of a
collateralized mortgage obligation. 

     There are four classes of bonds, including one class of zero coupon
bonds, which mature in the years 2000 through 2018; however, payments of the
bonds may occur prior to maturity in accordance with certain provisions of the
Trust Indenture between CFCC and the trustee. The remaining bonds have a
weighted average adjusted effective rate of 10.20%.

     Assets held in trust for the collateralized mortgage obligation of
$12,674,000 at December 31, 1993, consist of the following:

                                                  $13,815
</TABLE>

Under provisions of the Trust Indenture, the bonds are fully collateralized by
the FHLMC securities and funds held by the trustee. Funds held by the trustee
represent payments received on FHLMC securities, collateral reserves, and
reinvestment of earnings on such funds which have not been applied to pay
principal and interest on the bonds. These funds are restricted to assure 
payment on the bonds in accordance with the Indenture.

Long-Term Debt:
The Company's long-term debt consisted of the following:

Total long-term debt              $3,445           $9,409
</TABLE>

     Mortgage bonds represented Cambria County Industrial Development
Authority Bonds at an average rate of 6.87% over the life of the bond issue.
These bonds were issued on March 29, 1979, to finance U.S. Bank's Main Office
Headquarter's facility, which served as security for the bonds, and required
annual debt service payments through the year 2004.

     On October 1, 1993, the Company redeemed all remaining outstanding
principal on the bonds which totalled $5,075,000. The bonds were redeemed at par
value with no early redemption penalties which was in accordance with the
provisions of the indenture agreement since the bonds had already been
outstanding in excess of the minimum required time period of ten years.

     The bank note evidences a $4,000,000 loan to partially finance the
acquisition of Community Bancorp, Inc.. The loan originally was payable in equal
quarterly amounts of principal and interest of approximately $196,000 through
April 1999 and had a fixed annual interest rate of 9.50%. On August 31, 1993,
the Company refinanced this note and shortened the maturity date to July 31,
1996, and reduced the interest rate to one that floats at the Prime Rate.
The Company paid a prepayment premium of $170,000 to effect these favorable
modifications to the original note.

     Scheduled maturities of long-term debt for each of the five years
subsequent to December 31, 1993, are $1,275,000 in 1994; $1,234,000 in 1995;
$878,000 in 1996; $13,000 in 1997; and $45,000 in 1998.

12. DISCLOSURES ABOUT FAIR VALUE OF FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS


Statement of Financial Accounting Standards #107, "Disclosures about Fair
Value of Financial Instruments," requires all entities to disclose the estimated
fair value ofits financial instrument assets and liabilities. For the Company,
as for most financial institutions, approximately 95% of its assets and
liabilities are considered financial instruments as defined #107. Many of the
Company's financial instruments, however, lack an available trading market as
characterized by a willing buyer and willing seller engaging in an exchange
transaction.Therefore, significant 

<PAGE>23

estimations and present value calculations were used by the Company for the
purpose of this disclosure.

     Estimated fair values have been determined by the Company using the best
available data, as generally provided in the Company's FRY-9C Regulatory Reports
, and an estimation methodology suitable for each category of financial
instruments. Management believes that cash, cash equivalents, and loans and
deposits with floating interest rates have estimated fair values which
approximate the recorded book balances. The estimation method used, the
estimated fair values, and recorded book balances at December 31, 1993, were
as follows:

- -    Financial instruments actively traded in a secondary market have been
					valued using quoted available market prices.

     Changes in assumptions or estimation methodologies may have a material
effect on these estimated fair values.

     The Company's remaining assets and liabilities which are not considered
financial instruments have not been valued differently than has been customary
with historical cost accounting. No disclosure of the relationship value of
the Company's deposits is required by SFAS #107. Because of the Company's stable
core deposit base (which comprises 97% of total deposits), its non-use of
volatile funding sources such as brokered deposits, and a peer comparable
cost of deposits (actual cost in 1993 of 3.61% vs. a peer a of 3.44% as of
September 30, 1993), management believes the relationship deposits is
significant. Based upon limited secondary market transactions involving similar 
deposits, management estimates the relationship value of these funding
liabilities to range between $14 million to $30 million less than their
estimated fair value shown above. There is no material difference between
the notational amount and the estimated fair value of off-balance sheet items
which total $173.8 million and are primarily comprised of unfunded loan
commitments which are generally priced at market at the time of funding.

     Management is concerned that reasonable comparability of these disclosed
fair values between financial institutions may not be likely due to the wide
range of permitted valuation techniques and numerous estimates which must be
made given the absence of active secondary markets for many of the financial
instruments. This lack of uniform valuation methodologies also introduces a
greater degree of subjectivity to these estimated fair values.


13. INCOME TAXES

During the first quarter of 1993 the Company adopted Statement of Financial
Accounting Standards #109, "Accounting for Income Taxes." SFAS $NO109 utilizes
the liability method and deferred taxes are determined based on the estimated
future tax effects of differences between the financial statement and income tax
bases of assets and liabilities given the provisions of the enacted tax laws.
This adoption resulted in the recognition of a non-rec net benefit of $1,452,000
or $0.35 per share on a fully diluted basis. The ef standard on income tax
expense (exclusive of the cumulative effect adjustment) for December 31, 1993,
was not material.

     The provision for federal income taxes (before SFAS $NO109 benefit) is
summarized

     In August 1993, Congress passed the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of
1993 which increased the corporate tax rate from 34% to 35% on income greater
than $10 million. As a result of this increase in the tax rate, the Company
recognized an approximate $100,000 addition to the net deferred tax asset. This
caused a corresponding benefit to the provision for income taxes.

14. PENSION AND PROFIT SHARING PLANS

U.S. Bank:
U.S. Bank has a trusteed, noncontributory defined benefit pension plan
covering all employees who work at least 1,000 hours per year for U.S. Bank or
the Company and who have not yet reached age 60 at their employment date. The
benefits of the plan are based upon the employee's years of service and average
annual earnings for the highest five consecutive calendar years during the
final ten-year period of employment. U.S. Bank's plan fun been to contribute
annually an amount within the statutory range of allowance actuarially 
determined tax-deductible contributions. Plan assets are primarily debt
securities (including U.S. Agency and Treasury securities, corporate notes and
bonds), listed common stocks, mutual funds, and short-term cash equivalent
instruments. 

     Net periodic pension cost for the plan is as follows:

     Three Rivers Bank also has a trusteed 401(k) plan with contributions made
by Three Rivers Bank matching those by eligible employees up to a maximum of 1%
of their annual salary.  All employees of Three Rivers Bank who work over 1,000
hours per year are eligible to participate in the plan beginning on January 1
following six months of service. Three Rivers Bank's contribution to this 401(k)

Community:
Eligible Community employees participated in a non-contributory defined
multi-employer pension plan through June 30, 1993. The net pension cost for
contributions made to the plan amounted to $80,000 for the six month period in
1993 and $40,000 for the 1992 plan year. Effective July 1, 1993, the Company
began the process of merging Community's employees into Three Rivers Bank
pension plan. It is the Company's intent to recognize the transfer in the 1994
financial statements. It is anticipated by management, based upon advice from
the Company's actuary, that this transfer will have no significant impact on the
bank's financial statements.

Except for the above pension benefits provided by each subsidiary, the Company
has no significant additional exposure for any other post-retirement benefits.

15. LEASE COMMITMENTS

The Company's obligation for future minimum lease payments on operating leases
at December 31, 1993, is as follows:

1998 and thereafter (in total)         604
</TABLE>

     In addition to the amounts set forth above, certain of the leases require
payments by the Company for taxes, insurance, and maintenance.

     Rent expense included in total non-interest expense amounted to $493,000,
$414,000, and $364,000 in 1993, 1992, and 1991, respectively.

16. COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENT LIABILITIES

The Company's banking subsidiaries incur off-balance sheet risks in the normal
course of business in order to meet the financing needs of their customers.
These risks derive from commitments to extend credit and standby letters of
credit. Such commitments and standby letters of credit involve, to varying
degrees, elements of credit risk in excess of the amount recognized in the
consolidated financial statements.

     Commitments to extend credit are obligations to lend to a customer as
long as there is no violation of any condition established in the loan
agreement. Commitments generally have fixed expiration dates or other
termination clauses and may require payment of a fee. Since many of the 
commitments are expected to expire without being drawn upon, commitment amounts
do not necessarily represent future cash requirements. The banking subsidiaries
evaluate each customer's creditworthiness on a case-by-case basis. Collat-


<PAGE>27

eral which secures these types of commitments is the same as for other types
of secured lending such as accounts receivable, inventory, and fixed assets.

     Standby letters of credit are conditional commitments issued by the
banking subsidiaries to guarantee the performance of a customer to a third
party. Those guarantees are primarily issued to support public and private
borrowing arrangements, including normal business activities, bond financings
, and similar transactions. The credit risk involved in letters of credit is
essentially the same as that involved in extending loan of credit are issued 
both on an unsecured and secured basis. Collateral securing transactions is
similar to collateral securing the subsidiary banks' commercial loans.

     The Company's exposure to credit loss in the event of nonperformance by
the other party to these commitments to extend credit and standby letters of
credit is represented by their contractual amounts. The banking subsidiaries use
the same credit and collateral policies in making commitments and conditional
obligations as for all other lending. The Company had outstanding various
commitments to extend credit approximating $168,477,000 and standby letters of
credit of $5,367,000 as of December 31, 1993.

     Additionally, the Company is also subject to a number of asserted and
unasserted potential claims encountered in the normal course of business. In the
opinion of management and legal counsel, neither the resolution of these claims
nor the funding of these credit commitments will have a material adverse effect
on the Company's consolidated financial position or results of operation.

17. INCENTIVE STOCK OPTION PLAN

In 1991, the Company's board of directors adopted an Incentive Stock Option
Plan authorizing the grant of options covering 128,000 shares of common stock.
Under the Plan, options can be granted (the "Grant Date") to employees with
executive, managerial, technical, or professional responsibility, as selected by
a committee of the board of directors. The option price at which a stock option
may be exercised shall be a price as determined by the committee, but shall not
be less than 100% of the fair market value per share of common stock on the
Grant Date. The maximum term of any option granted under the Plan cannot exceed
 10 years. The following stock option activity was recognized:

     On or after the first anniversary of the Grant Date, one-third of such
options may be exercised. On or after the second anniversary of the Grant Date,
two-thirds of such options may be exercised minus the aggregate number of such
options previously exercised. On or after the third anniversary of the Grant
Date, the remainder of the options may be exercised.

18. PREFERRED STOCK

On November 20, 1992, the Board of Directors authorized the redemption of all
outstanding shares of the Company's Series A $2.125 Cumulative Convertible
Non-Voting Preferred Stock. The redemption date was established as April 7,
1993. The Preferred Stock redemption presented shareholders with the choice of
either redeeming their shares at the redemption price of $25.638 per share or
converting their shares into 1.136 shares of the Company Stock. Shareholders of
only 53,283 shares opted to redeem their shares resuume redemption payout of
approximately $1.4 million; shareholders of 498,717 shares 90%) elected to
convert their shares. This conversion resulted in the issuance of 566,543 new
common shares.

19.DIVIDEND REINVESTMENT PLAN

The Company's revised Dividend Reinvestment and Common Stock Purchase Plan
provides each holder of Common Stock and Series A Preferred Stock (the "Eligible
Securities") with a method of purchasing additional common shares without
payment of any brokerage commission, service charge, or other similar expense. A
participant in the Plan may elect either to reinvest dividends on all of his
shares of Eligible Securities and/or to make optional co payments of not less
than $10 each purchase up to a maximum of $2,000 per quarter and continue to 
receive regular dividend payments on his other shares. A participant may
withdraw from the Plan at any time.

     The price of shares purchased by a participant in the Plan will be 100%
of the average of the daily high and low sales prices of the shares quoted on
the NASDAQ National Market System on the investment date. Since such additional
shares of Common Stock will be purchased directly from the Company, the Company
will receive additional funds for general corporate purposes. At December 31,
1993, the Company had 281,923 unissued reserved shares under the Plan.

<PAGE>28


20. SHAREHOLDER RIGHTS PLAN

Each share of the Company's Common Stock has attached to it one right (a
"Right") issued pursuant to a Shareholder Protection Rights Agreement, dated
November 10, 1989, (the "Rights Agreement"). Each Right will initially entitled
a holder to buy one-tenth of a share of the Company's Series B Preferred Stock
at a price of $40.00, subject to adjustment (the "Exercise Price"). The Rights
become exercisable if a person, group, or other entities acquires or announces a
tender offer for 20% or more of the Company's Common Stock. They can also be
exercised if a person or group who has become a beneficial owner of at least
10% of the Company's Common Stock is declared by the board of directors to be an
"adverse person" (as defined in the Rights Agreement). Under the Rights
Agreement, any person, group, or entity will be deemed a beneficial owner of the
Company's Common Stock if such person, group, or entity would be
deemed to beneficially own the Company's Common Stock under the rules of the
Securities and Exchange Commission which generally require that such person,
group, or entity have, or have the right to acquire within sixty days, voting or
dispositive power of the Company's Common Stock; provided, however, that the
Rights Agreement excludes from the definition of beneficial owner, holders of
revocable proxies, employee benefit plans of the Company its subsidiaries
and the Trust Company. After the Rights become exercisable, the Rights (other
than Rights held by a 20% beneficial owner or an "adverse person") will entitle
the holders to purchase, under certain circumstances, either the Company's
Common Stock or common stock of the potential acquirer having a value equal to
twice the Exercise Price. The Company is generally entitled to redeem the Rights
at $.01 per Right at any time until the twentieth business day following public
announcement that a 20% position has been acquired or the board of directors
has designated a holder of the Company's Common Stock an adverse person. The
Rights expire on November 10, 1994. The Rights Agreement may have the effect of
deterring or discouraging a non-negotiated tender or exchange offer for the
Company, the acquisition of a large block of the Company's Common Stock, and the
removal of the Company's management.

21. COMMUNITY BANCORP, INC. MERGER

Effective as of the beginning of business on March 23, 1992, the Company
merged Community Bancorp, Inc. with and into a newly formed subsidiary of the
Company with Community surviving the merger. Community Bancorp, Inc., a
Pennsylvania corporation, is a registered bank holding company under the Bank
Holding Company Act of 1956, as amended, whose sole direct subsidiary is
Community (formerly Community Savings Association), a Pennsylvania-chartered
FDIC-insured savings bank. Community has the following direct subsidiaries:
Community First Capital Corporation (a special purpose finance subsidiary),
Community First Financial Corporation (a subsidiary engaged in real estate joint
ventures), and Frontier Consumer Discount Company. In accordance with Federal
Reserve Board policy, the Company has committed to divest its equity investment
in Community First Financial Corporation within two years after the effective
date or such longer period as the Federal Reserve Board. The Company acquired
all of the outstanding common stock and stock options of Community Bancorp, Inc.
with Community Bancorp, Inc. shareholders receiving $14.1 million in cash and
388,213 shares of the Company's common stock. The total cost was $21,709,000.
The acquisition has been accounted for by the purchase method and, accordingly,
Community's assets and liabilities have been adjusted estimated fair values at
the effective date. The fair value of Community's net assets acquired exceeded
the purchase price by $2,677,000 which reduced the value assigned to the
premises and equipment of Community. The results of operations of Community for
the period from March 23, 1992, through December 31, 1992, amounting to
$2,980,000 of net income, was included in the Company's 1992 income statement. 

     The pro forma combined results of operations of the Company for the years
ended December 31, 1992 and 1991, after giving effect to the pro forma
adjustments as of the beginning of the periods, are as follows:

22. BRANCHES ACQUISITION

On April 2, 1993, the Company's Three Rivers Bank subsidiary and Integra
National Bank/Pittsburgh consummated the acquisition of four Integra branch
offices ("Integra") located in the suburban Pittsburgh market area pursuant to a
Purchase and Assumption Agreement (the "Agreement"). In connection with the
transaction, Three Rivers Bank assumed $88.6 million in deposit liabilities and
purchased $12.1 million of assets; these assets consisted of: home equity and
other consumer loans; vault cash; furniture, fixtures, and equipment; real
estate together with improvements; and safe deposit box business. In addition,
Three Rivers Bank assumed certain other liabilities including contracts that
relate to the operation of the branches and real estate leases relating to one
branch and one ATM. In consideration for the assumption of the deposit
liabilities, Three Rivers Bank paid Integra a deposit premium million.

     The ability of subsidiary banks to upstream cash to the Company is
restricted by regulations. Federal law prevents the Company from borrowing from
its subsidiary banks unless the loans are secured by specified assets. Further,
such secured loans are limited in amount to ten percent of the subsidiary banks'
capital and surplus. In addition, the subsidiary banks are subject to legal
limitations on the amount of dividends that can be paid shareholder. The
dividend limitation generally restricts dividend payments to a bank's retained
net income for the current and preceding two calendar years. Cash may also be
upstreamed to the Parent Company by the subsidiary banks as an inter-entity
management fee; these fees must be based upon the fair market value of services
provided by the Company. At December 31, 1993, the subsidiary banks were
permitted to upstream an additional $10,799,000 in cash dividends on a secured
basis $2,923,000 to the Company. The subsidiary banks also had a combined
$81,230,000 of restricted surplus and retained earnings at December 31, 1993.

     The Company also had available at December 31, 1993, a $1 million unused
line of credit from a non-affiliated correspondent bank. This line of credit is
unsecured and is subject to annual review on September 30, 1994. Future
drawdowns on this line, if any, would be at a rate of "Prime." Additionally,
there is an annual commitment fee of 1/4% on any unused portion of the

     Based on the risk-based capital guidelines of the Board of Governors of
the Federal Reserve System, a bank holding company such as the Company, is
required to maintain a Tier 1 capital to risk-adjusted assets ratio of 4.00% and
total capital to risk-adjusted assets of 8.00%. At December 31, 1993, the
Company and each of its banking subsidiaries exceeded their respective
regulatory requirements.

24. SUBSEQUENT EVENT (unaudited)

The Company and Johnstown Savings Bank announced on January 18, 1994, that
they have reached agreement on revised terms to the definitive agreement
pursuant to which Johnstown Savings Bank ("JSB") would merge with United States
National Bank in Johnstown. The definitive agreement was signed by the parties
on November 10, 1993, and provided for the payment to JSB stockholders at the
closing of the merger .528 share of the Company's common stock and $11.03
in cash for each JSB share outstanding based upon an assumed market value of
the Company's common stock of $25.50. With a 55% stock and 45% cash split,
this represented a transaction value of approximately $47.5 million or $24.50
per JSB common share.

     On December 20, 1993, the Company proposed that the definitive agreement
be amended to the effect that JSB stockholders would receive at closing .464
share of the Company's common stock and $9.68 in cash for each JSB share
outstanding based on an assumed market value of $25.50 for the Company's common
stock. At the average closing price of the Company's common stock for the ten
trading days immediately preceding the December 20th announcement, this
modification translated into an indicated transaction value or $21.02 per JSB
common share.

     After negotiations, the parties executed an amendment to the definitive
agreement which provides that the Company will pay $10.13 in cash and a fraction
of a share of the Company's common stock based upon a formula relating to the
average closing price for the Company's common stock on the NASDAQ National
Market System for the ten trading days immediately preceding the closing date.
If the average closing price for the Company's common stock on the closing date 
of the merger: (a) is less than or equal to $24.50 then the stock component 
of the merger consideration will be .505 of a share of the stock; (b) is greater
than or equal to $25.50, then the stock component of will be .485 of a share 
of the Company's common stock; and (c) is greater than but less than $25.50
per share, then the stock component of the merger considered determined by
dividing $22.50 by the average closing price and multiplying the resulting 
amount by 55%. JSB has the right to terminate the amended agreement in the event
that the average closing price of the Company's common stock for the ten trading
days immediately preceding the closing is less than $20.50 per share.

  At the time the amendment was signed by the parties, final for each party
provided a written opinion to the Boards of Directors of the Company and
Johnstown Savings Bank that the revised merger consideration set forth in the
amendment was fair from a financial point of view to the Company and the
stockholders of JSB. 

 The amendment further permitted JSB to seek bids for the merger or 
acquisition of JSB from other interested parties until February 17, 1994. If any
bid exceeded the consideration provided for in the amendment, then JSB's Board
of Directors would have been free to terminate its agreement with the Company
and enter into an agreement with such bidder with no liability to the Company.
The Company's option to acquire up to 19.9% of the outstanding shares of JSB
was suspended during this marketing period.

     On February 18, 1994, the Company and JSB announced the expiration of the
marketing period where JSB had the ability to seek a merger with a third party
at a higher price per share than agreed to by the Company. Johnstown Savings
Bank has informed the Company that it did not enter into a merger agreement with
another party and that by the terms of the agreement JSB will proceed with
the USBANCORP merger. Based upon a February 17, 1994, USBANCORP closing stock
price of $24.00, this would imply an acquisition cost approximately $43.3
million.

     The transaction is subject to regulatory approvals and to the approvals
of the stockholders of the Company and Johnstown Savings Bank.

To the Stockholders and
Board of Directors of
USBANCORP, Inc.


Management of USBANCORP, Inc. and its subsidiaries have prepared the
consolidated financial statements and other information in the "Annual Report
and Form 10-K" in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles and
are responsible for its accuracy.

     In meeting its responsibility, management relies on internal accounting
and related control systems, which include selection and training of qualified
personnel, establishment and communication of accounting and administrative 
policies and procedures, appropriate segregation of responsibilities, and
programs of internal audit. These systems are designed to provide reasonable 
assurance that financial records are reliable for preparing financial statements
and maintaining accountability for assets and that assets are safeguarded
against unauthorized use or disposition. Such assurance cannot be absolute 
because of inherent limitations in any internal control system.

     Management also recognizes its responsibility to foster a climate in
which Company affairs are conducted with the highest ethical standards. The
Company's Code of Conduct, furnished to each employee and director, addresses
the importance of open internal communications, potential conflicts of interest,
compliance with applicable laws, including those related to financial
disclosure, the confidentiality of proprietary information, and other items. 
There is an ongoing program to assess compliance with these policies.

     The Audit Committee of the Company's Board of Directors consists solely
of outside directors. The Audit Committee meets periodically with management and
the independent accountants to discuss audit, financial reporting, and related
matters. Arthur Andersen & Co. and the Company's internal auditors have direct
access to the Audit Committee.

REPORTS OF INDEPENDENT PUBLIC ACCOUNTANTS

To the Stockholders and Board of Directors of USBANCORP, Inc.:

We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of USBANCORP,
Inc. (a Pennsylvania corporation) and subsidiaries as of December 31, 1993 and 
1992, and the related consolidated statements of income, stockholders' equity
and cash flows for the years then ended. These financial statements are the

an opinion on these financial statements based on our audits.  The financial

auditors whose report, dated February 12, 1992, expressed an unqualified opinion
on that statement.

     We conducted our audits in accordance with generally accepted auditing
standards. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material
misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting 
the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. An audit also includes 
assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by 
management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation.
We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.

     In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present
fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of USBANCORP, Inc. and 
subsidiaries as of December 31, 1993 and 1992, and the results of their
operations and their cash flows for the years then ended in conformity with
generally accepted accounting principles.

     As discussed in Note 13 to the Consolidated Financial Statements,
effective January 1, 1993, the Company changed its method of accounting for
income taxes.

MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS ("M. D. & A.")

The following discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of
operations of USBANCORP should be read in conjunction with the consolidated 
financial statements of USBANCORP, including the related notes thereto, 
included elsewhere herein.

RESULTS OF OPERATIONS FOR THE FISCAL YEARS ENDED
DECEMBER 31, 1993, 1992, AND 1991

PERFORMANCE OVERVIEW...The Company's net income for 1993 was $12,488,000 or
$2.72 on a fully diluted per share basis compared to net income of $8,883,000 
or $2.53 per fully diluted share for 1992 and net income of $7,312,000 or 
$2.29 per fully diluted share for 1991. The Company's current year net income 
includes a $1,452,000 or $.35 per fully diluted share non-recurring benefit
due to the adoption of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards NO.109,
"Accounting for Income Taxes." (See further discussion under "Income Tax 
Expense.")
Before the SFAS $NO109 benefit, 1993 net income was $11,036,000 or $2.41 per
fully diluted share. Similarly, the 1991 net income included a $1,004,000 or 
$.31 per fully diluted share extraordinary income tax benefit resulting from 
the full utilization of all remaining net operating loss carryforward. Before 
this extraordinary item, 1991 net income was $6,308,000 or $1.97 per fully 
diluted share. The Company's 1992 results were not impact extraordinary items.
     
     When 1993 is compared with 1992, the Company's net income before the SFAS
#109 benefit increased by $2,153,000 or 24.2% while fully diluted earnings per
share decreased by $.12 or 4.7%. Similar trends were noted for two other key 
performance ratios as the Company's return on assets before the SFAS $NO109 
benefit improved by six-basis points to .91% while the return on equity before 
the SFAS $NO109 benefit declined by 128 basis points 10.13%. The increase in
net income is attributed to the Company's ability to continue to enhance
Community's net income and the accretive impact of the purchase of the four
Integra branch offices. Additionally, net income and return on assets increased
due to continued core growth in non-interest income, increased gains realized on
the sale of investment securities available for sale, and the interest 
earnings generated on $24.6 million of net funds provided from the Company's
secondary common stock offering completed in February 1993. This secondary
common stock offering resulted in the issuance of 1,150,000 new shares of the
Company's common stock causing a 30.5% increase in weighted average fully
diluted shares outstanding to approximately 4.59 million. The initial temporary
dilutive effect of these additional shares was the major factor responsible for 
the $.12 decline in fully diluted earnings per share 128 basis point drop in
return on average equity experienced in 1993.

     When 1992 is compared with 1991, each of the Company's key performance
indicators demonstrated improvement on a before extraordinary item basis. These
increased financial results reflect the accretive impact of the Community 
Acquisition, increased gains realized on the sale of fixed-rate mortgage
loans held for sale and investment securities available for sale, and core
growth in non-interest income. The more significant 202 basis point increase
in return on equity as compared to the two-basis point improvement in return on
assets was due to increased

leveraging of the Company's capital as a result of the Community Acquisition.
The following table summarizes some of the Company's key performance 
indicators for each of the past three years:

IMPACT OF THE ACQUISITIONS...The Community Acquisition was consummated on
March 23, 1992, and was a key factor responsible for the Company's improved
earnings. The 1993 results include Community for the entire year compared to
only slightly over nine months for 1992. The 1993 earnings reflect a net income
contribution of $3,333,000 (before the favorable effect of SFAS NO.109) from
Community compared to a $2,980,000 net income contribution from Community for
1992. This net income increase of $353,000 resulted primarily from the 
additional days of ownership and increased fee income as Community's total
non-interest income grew at an annualized rate of 13% in 1993.

     The Integra Branches Acquisition, consummated on April 2, 1993, also had
a favorable impact on 1993 earnings. Due to conversion related expenses and lags
in the timing of settlement of investment security purchases, the net income
benefit that the Integra Branches Acquisition contributed for the second quarter
of 1993 amounted to approximately $70,000. This net income contribution from
Integra doubled to approximately $140,000 for each of the third and fourth
quarters making the total 1993 income contribution from this acquisition
$350,000.

     In addition to the overall net income comparison mentioned above, these
acquisitions also caused a material increase in average earning assets, average
interest bearing liabilities, and the major income and expense line item
components. In addition to the increase in aggregate balances of average earning
assets andaverage interest bearing liabilities, the also a significant change
in balance sheet composition and loan loss reserve coverage. The following
discussion identifies the principal effects of the acquisitions, as well as,
underlying trends affecting USBANCORP.

NET INTEREST INCOME AND MARGIN...The following table summarizes the Company's
net interest income performance for each of the past three years:

</TABLE>

<PAGE>41


     When 1993 is compared to 1992, USBANCORP's net interest income increased
by $5.0 million or 11.0% while the net interest margin percentage declined by 24
basis points to 4.34%. The increased net interest income was due primarily to a
higher volume of earning assets resulting from the previously mentioned
acquisitions and the $24.6 million in net funds provided from the secondary
common stock offering. For 1993, total average earning a $167 million higher
than 1992. The contraction in the net interest margin percentage can be best
explained by the following factors:

- -    The Company, through asset restructurings and effective asset liability
management practices, has stabilized Community's net interest margin in the
3.80% to 4.00% range while reducing Community's overall exposure to interest
rate risk. This current net interest margin represents an improvement over
Community's pre-acquisition net interest margin performance which averaged
2.84% for the fiscal year ended September 30, 1991. It is, however, lower
than the net interest margin operating performance of approximately 4.60%
experienced at the Company's other banking subsidiaries margin performance at
Community can be attributed to its more typical savings bank balance
sheet mix; this mix includes a greater proportion of one-to-four family
residential mortgage loans and more reliance on certificates of deposit, rather
than non-interest bearing demand deposit accounts, as a funding source. It is
the Company's intent to gradually improve Community's margin to a higher
operating level by diversifying the loan mix to include more rate sensitive and
shorter maturity commercial and consumer loans. This diversification of the loan
portfolio has already begun as commercial loans comprised 15% of Community's 
total loan portfolio at December 31, 1993, compare only 4% at March 31, 1992. A 
similar decline in the dependence on real estate was experienced as 
Community's real estate loan portfolio composition percentage decreased from 
82% to 74% between these same two dates. Continued pursuit of this loan mix
diversification strategy should allow the Company to further improve Community's
net interest margin from the current 3.80% to 4.00% level.

- -    Since only $10 million of loans were acquired with the Integra branch
offices, the majority of the $88 million of acquired Integra deposits were 
redeployed into investment securities.  Additionally, $24.6 million of funds 
provided from the secondary common stock issuance were also invested in the 
securities portfolio. This initial dependence on the investment portfolio as
the primary source of return on these acquired deposits and stock issuance
proceeds was also a major factor contributing to the contraction in the
net interest margin percentage. It is management's intent to use a portion of 
this excess investment portfolio liquidity to more profitably fund anticipated
loan growth in order to improve the net interest margin; this should be 
achievable since the yield on currently originated loans ranges from 100 to 
225 basis points more than the average fourth quarter 1993 yield of 5.54% in
the investment portfolio. This margin improvement, however, will be gradual 
since the earning asset yield will continue to be negatively impacted by
regularly scheduled maturities and prepayments of higher yielding loans and 
securities purchased or originated several years ago; the downward magnitude of
the repricing on these older earning assets will exceed the repricing benefits 
experienced on the liability side of the balance sheet since the short-term 
certificates of deposit and low cost core savings accounts have generally
already been repriced to current market rates.

<PAGE>42


     When 1992 is compared with 1991, the Company's net interest income
increased by $11.8 million or 35.3% while the net interest margin percentage
declined by 11 basis points to 4.58%.  The inclusion of Community's net interest
income of $11.7 million was the principal reason for the increase. Likewise,
the contraction in the net interest margin percentage was also attributed to
Community for the same reasons previously mentioned. The amount of the margin
contraction in 1992 was not as significant as that experienced in 1993 since 
several of the asset restructuring strategies were not executed until the 
fourth quarter of 1992. Additionally, a significant portion of the initial
favorable impact of deposit rate reductions designed to make Community's 
pricing more consistent with bank competition and the Company's other 
subsidiaries was experienced in 1992.
     
     The table that follows provides an analysis of net interest income on a
tax-equivalent basis setting forth (i) average assets, liabilities, and 
stockholders' equity, (ii) interest income earned on interest earning assets 
and interest expense paid on interest bearing liabilities, (iii) average yields
earned on interest earning assets and average rates paid on interest bearing
liabilities, (iv) USBANCORP's interest rate spread (the difference between the 
average yield earned on interest earning assets and the average rate paid on 
interest bearing liabilities), and (v) USBANCORP's net interest margin (net 
interest income as a percentage of average total interest earning assets).
For purposes of this table, loan balances include non-accrual loans and
interest income on loans includes loan fees or amortization of such fees 
which have been deferred as well as interest recorded on non-accrual loans as 
cash is received once the principal has been fully paid.

     Net interest income may also be analyzed by segregating the volume and
rate components of interest income and interest expense. The table below sets 
forth an analysis of volume and rate changes in net interest income on a
tax-equivalent basis. For purposes of this table, changes in interest income
and interest expense are allocated to volume and rate categories based upon the
respective percentage changes in average balances and average rates. Changes
in net interest income that could not be specifically identified as either a
rate or volume change were allocated proportionately to changes in volume and
changes in rate.

</TABLE>

     Regarding the separate components of net interest income, the Company's
total interest income for 1993 increased by $2.9 million or 3.6% when compared
to 1992. This increase was due entirely to the previously mentioned $167 million
increase in the total volume of average earning assets which resulted in a $7.5
million increase in interest income between years. This positive factor was
offset by an unfavorable rate variance of $4.6 million a the Company's earning
assets have repriced downward in conjunction with the in interest rates.
Specifically, the yield on the loan portfolio has decreased 8.61% while the
yield on total investment securities and investment securities available for 
sale as dropped 124 basis points to 5.70%. The national and local market trend
of accelerated customer refinancing of mortgage loans has contributed materially
to the declining yields experienced in both of these portfolios. Finally, the
previously mentioned increased dependence on investment securities as a
funding use has negatively impacted the earning asset mix.

<PAGE>45


     The Company's total interest income increased $16.6 million or 24.8% for
the year ended December 31, 1992, compared to the same 1991 period as a
result of the Community Acquisition, which added $24.7 million of total interest
income. Excluding the Community Acquisition, USBANCORP's total interest income
decreased by $8.1 million or 12.1% over the prior year ended December 31, 1991.
This decrease was a result of a decline in interest rates that was partially
offset by a shift in the composition of average earning response to the
declining rate environment and reduced consumer and commercial loan demand,
USBANCORP  shifted its average portfolio composition from short-term investments
such as interest bearing deposits with banks, federal funds sold and securities
purchased under agreements to resell to investments with longer average
maturities and higher yields. An emphasis was placed on the purchase of short
average life mortgage- and asset-backed securities which source of monthly cash
flow.

     The Company's total interest expense for 1993 decreased by $2.1 million
or 5.5% when compared to 1992. This decline occurred despite an additional $7.1
million of interest expense generated from a $115 million increase in the volume
of average interest bearing liabilities. This negative factor was more than
offset by a $9.2 million favorable rate variance which resulted primarily from
management repricing all deposit categories downward declining interest rate
environment. The magnitude of the downward repricing was more pronounced at
Community as their deposit rate structure was reduced to levels more consistent
with bank competition and the Company's other banking subsidiaries. It has been
management's ongoing pricing strategy to position USBANCORP's deposit rates
within the lowest quartile of deposit rates offered by commercial banks in its
market area. Management believes that a constant level of high service
quality mitigates the impact of incremental downward rate movement deposit base
size and funds availability provided that the rates offered are not appreciably
below competition. Regarding the deposit mix, the Company has experienced a
shift of funds from short-term certificates of deposit into more liquid interest
bearing demand and savings accounts due to the narrowing of the rate spread
between these products and customer preference for liquidity in this low
interest rate environment. The Company has also used an add million (average
balance) of advances from the Federal Home Loan Bank to extend the liability
maturity base at Community in order to better manage interest rate risk.
These price and liability composition movements allowed USBANCORP to lower
the average cost of interest bearing liabilities by 76 basis points from
4.52% in 1992 to 3.76% in 1993. 

     USBANCORP's total interest expense increased to $38.3 million for 1992
from $33.5 million for 1991 as a result of the Community Acquisition. Excluding
the Community Acquisition, USBANCORP's total interest expense decreased $8.2
million for 1992 compared to 1991 primarily as a result of a decline in interest
rates, implementation of management's strategy of reducing deposit rates, and
lessening reliance on high cost certificates of deposit in excess of $100,000 by
$10.8 million. USBANCORP also experienced a shift from long-term into short-term
deposits due to the previously mentioned customer preference for liquidity in
the low rate environment that prevailed during the period. These price and
deposit composition movements, combined with the economic climate of declining
interest rates, allowed USBANCORP to lower the average cost of interest bearing
liabilities from 5.70% during 1991 to 4.52% during 1992. 

PROVISIONS FOR LOAN LOSSES...USBANCORP's provision for loan losses in 1993,
1992, and 1991 was $2.4 million, $2.2 million, and $900,000, respectively. When
expressed as a  percentage of average loans, the provision has averaged .34% for
1993, .36% for 1992, and .21% for 1991. The $200,000 or 9.0% increase in the 


<PAGE>46


provision between 1993 and 1992 was due to the inclusion of a full year's
provision at Community. Similarly, the increase between 1991 and 1992 was
primarily because of a $1.3 million provision for loan losses made at Community.
As a result of these increased provision levels in 1992 and 1993, Community was
able to build its level of loan loss reserves to conform with USBANCORP's policy
and make its reserve coverage more consistent with banking industry levels.

     Net charge-offs for 1993 were $892,000 or 0.13% of average loans and
loans held for sale compared to $3.6 million or 0.58% in 1992, and $367,000 or
0.08% in 1991. The 1993 amount represents a more recurrent net charge-off level
for the Company. The higher 1992 net charge-offs resulted primarily from
portfolio cleanup at Community immediately following the acquisition. The
provision for loan losses less net charge-offs in 1993 add $1.5 million to the
allowance for loan losses which increased to $15.3 million at December 31,
1993. (See additional discussion under "Allowance for Loan Losses.")

NON-INTEREST INCOME...Non-interest income for 1993 totalled $10.2 million
which represented a $1.8 million or 21.6% increase over 1992. This increase was
primarily due to an $855,000 increase in service charges on deposit accounts, a
$524,000 increase in trust fees, a $190,000 increase in realized gains on the
sale of investment securities classified as "available for sale," and a $92,000
increase in wholesale cash processing fees. These positive factors were 
partially offset by a$144,000 decrease in gains realized on classified as "held
for sale." 

     The $855,000 or 44.6% increase in deposit service charges resulted partly
from higher deposit levels due to the acquisitions. Additionally, the other
significant part of this increase was due to the benefits of a revised deposit
service charge pricing strategy implemented at Community on March 1, 1993. As a
result of implementation of this pricing strategy, deposit service charges at
Community increased by approximately $400,000 in 1993. During the course of
1993, management has noted that customers at Community have adjusted their
savings patterns to minimize the impact of the new service charge pricing; and
consequently, as a result of these customer adjustments, management expects the
recurring benefit to decline to $300,000 annually. This new deposit service
charge pricing strategy has raised Community's fee structure to a level
commensurate with its banking competition and the Company's other banking
subsidiaries.

     The $524,000 or 25.5% increase in trust fees resulted primarily from
continued successful business development efforts as total trust assets
(discretionary and non-discretionary) have grown by 45.1% since December 31,
1992, to $943 million at December 31, 1993. Specifically, corporate trust assets
grew by $98 million or 44%, employee benefit assets grew by $60 million or
26%, and personal trust assets grew by $75 million or 29% growth in personal
trust assets was fueled by the continued successful sales of the Pathroad
Account, a competitively priced mutual fund product. Trust income for 1993 was
also enhanced by a $75,000 increase in estate fees making the core trust fee
growth rate for the current period approximately 22%. This core trust fee growth
is prompted by the expansion of the Company's business throughout western
Pennsylvania including the Greater Pittsburgh marketplace. The Trust staff's
marketing skills combined with their ability to deliver quality service has
been the key to the Company's growth rate; and, while there can be no assurances
of continuation of this approximate 22% average annual trust fee growth
experienced over the past four years, these factors provide a foundation for
future growth of this important source of non-interest sensitive fee income.

     The increase in realized gains on the sale of investment securities
available for sale resulted from the execution of several investment strategies
to capture available 

<PAGE>47


market premiums on various mortgage-backed securities which had the
characteristics of low remaining balances and fast prepayment histories. Also,
the $92,000 increase in wholesale cash processing fees resulted from continued
growth in the customer base. Even though it was a $144,000 reduction from 1992,
the Company realized $593,000 in gains from the sale of approximately $22
million of 30-year fixed-rate residential mortgage loans which were originated
during 1993. These loans were classified as "held for sale" in accordance with
a previously disclosed strategy by the Company to sell new 30-year fixed-rate
mortgage products in an effort to help neutralize long-term interest rate risk. 
Servicing rights amounting to approximately 35 basis points on the loan balance
outstanding were retained on these sold loans in order to provide the Company 
with a recurrent source of fee income. Given the Company loan pricing strategy 
of offering zero point mortgage loans at a slight pre-market rates, 
management expects to generate modest gains from fixed rate mortgage sales each
quarter. The amount of the gain may, however, vary depending upon the volume of
new 30-year mortgage loan activity and market conditions at the time of sale.

     Total non-interest income of $8.3 million increased by $2.3 million or
38.3% between 1991 and 1992. This increase in non-interest income was primarily 
due to the Community Acquisition which added $1.45 million in non-interest
income and gains on sales of investments of $393,000. Of the $1.45 million of 
non-interest income from Community, $737,000 resulted  a gain recognized on the
sale of fixed rate mortgage loans. 
     
     Non-interest income, excluding net gains on the disposition of investment
securities available for sale and loans held for sale, increased by
approximately 19% for the year ended December 31, 1992, compared to the same
period for 1991. This increase in non-interest income was primarily due to an
increase in trust fees, wholesale cash processing fees, and service charges
on deposit accounts. Trust fees grew to $2.1 million or successful business 
development efforts in both the personal trust and employee benefits areas.
The increase in wholesale cash processing fees was the result of the election by
several customers to be assessed actual fees instead of maintaining compensating
balances and overall growth in the customer base. The increase in service charge
income on deposit accounts was primarily due to higher volume of fees combined 
with growth of a packaged deposit product. 

NON-INTEREST EXPENSE...Total non-interest expense of $40.7 million increased
by $4.5 million or 12.3% when compared to 1992. This increase was primarily
caused by the following items:

- -    a $1.5 million increase in other expense due in part to a loss on the
disposition of another real estate owned property which had a book value of
approximately $3.1 million. The Company initially took a $550,000 charge in
the second quarter of 1993 to write-down the property to its estimated fair
market value. When the property was finally sold in the fourth quarter of 1993,
the Company recovered $263,000 of the initial write-down making the net loss on
the transaction $287,000. Also contributing to expense increase was $183,000 of
amortization expense of the core deposit premium purchased. Integra deposits and
approximately $50,000 of final expenses related this same acquisition.
Additionally, there were approximately $300,000 of non-recurring expenses 
incurred for a computer conversion at Community from an outside data processing
contractor toan in-house computer processing system at Three Rivers Bank
in the fourth quarter of 1993. Management expects to fully recover these
one-time conversion costs in 1994 as the efficiencies generated from a
centralized western region data 

<PAGE>48

processing center is expected to generate $300,000 of ongoing annual
savings. Finally, in the fourth quarter of 1993, the Company also charged-off
$73,000 of remaining debt issuance costs due to the early retirement of the
mortgage bonds used to finance U.S. Bank's Main Office headquarter's facility.
This charge will be fully recovered in 1994 through improved net interest margin
performance as short-term investments and investment securities yielding
approximately 4.50% were liquidated to retire this $5,075,000 debt that had an
average cost of approximately 7%. 

- -    a $1,914,000 or 10.6% increase in salaries and employee benefits due to
planned wage increases approximating 4%, an additional 30 (average) full-time
equivalent employees due to the previously mentioned acquisitions and increased
group hospitalization expense.

- -    a $464,000 or 15.8% increase in net occupancy expense due to the 
additional branch facilities acquired, higher maintenance and repair costs, and
a $100,000 increase in depreciation expense due to a purchase price allocation 
adjustmentrelated to Community.

     Total non-interest expense of $36.2 million increased by $7.4 million or
25.6% for 1992 compared to 1991. Of this increase, $6.3 million was a result of
the Community Acquisition. The remaining increase of $1.1 million was primarily
due to increases in salaries and employee benefits, net occupancy expense,
equipment expense, professional fees, and FDIC deposit insurance expense.
Non-interest expense in 1992 included approximately $400,000 of non-recurring
expenses for fees paid to productivity consultants. 

NET OVERHEAD BURDEN...Although non-interest expense has increased as a result
of the Community and Integra Branches Acquisitions, these acquisitions have
contributed favorably to lowering USBANCORP's net overhead ratios.
Specifically, the Company's ratio of net overhead expense (non-interest expense 
less non-interest income) to net interest income has shown continued improvement
as it averaged 61.8% in 1993 compared to 62.8% in 1992 and 69.4% in 1991. 
Furthermore, when the 1993 ratio is compared to the 1988 aver 83.8%, this 
reflects a more dramatic decrease. Similarly, the Company's net overhead to 
average assets ratio has improved from 3.01% in 1991 to 2.68% in 1992 to a 
record low of 2.51% in 1993. Employee productivity has also increased annually
for each of the past five years as total assets per employee has increased 
noticeably from $1.35 million in 1989 to $1.87 million in a 38% improvement. The
improvement in each of these net overhead measures demonstrates management's 
ongoing commitment to achieving productivity enhancement operational 
efficiencies, and economy of scale benefits. Management has targeted a goal of 
reducing the Company's net overhead expense to net interest income ratio to 55%
over the five year strategic planning forecast. The successful acquisition of
JSB should allow the Company to reach this goal even sooner than originally 
planned.

INCOME TAX EXPENSE...As discussed earlier, the Company adopted Statement of
Financial Accounting Standards $NO109, "Accounting For Income Taxes," in the 
first quarter of 1993. This adoption resulted in the recording of a deferred 
tax asset of $1,452,000 and a corresponding credit to the income statement as a 
cumulative effect of change in accounting principle. Excluding this 
non-recurring benefit, the Company's provision for income taxes was $5.5 million
reflecting an effective tax rate of 33.2%. This represented a tax expense 
increase of $44,000 over 1992 due solely to the higher pre-tax income since the
effective tax rate between years declined as a result of increased tax-free 
asset holdings.

<PAGE>49


     The provision for income taxes was $5.4 million for 1992 compared to $2.9
million for 1991. The increase in the provision for income taxes in 1992 was 
primarily due to the Community Acquisition and its higher effective combined 
income tax rate. In addition, in 1991, the Company recognized a benefit of $1.0 
million due to utilization of all remaining net operating loss carry forward.

SIGNIFICANT NON-RECURRING INCOME AND EXPENSE...In 1993, USBANCORP
recognized the net unfavorable effect of several non-recurring items
aggregating approximately $367,000. The largest items were $350,000 of expenses 
related to the Community data processing and Integra branch conversions, a
$287,000 loss on an other real estate owned property, a $73,000 write-off of 
bond issuance costs, and $343,000 of realized gains from fixed-rate mortgage 
loan sales. (While heavily affected by economic and market circumstances, it
is management's expectation to generate recurrent annual income of $250,000
from its ongoing program of selling new 30-year fixed rate mortgage loans. 
Accordingly, $343,000 of the total $593,000 of realized gains from fixed-rate 
mortgage loan sales in 1993 are considered non-recurring.) 

     In 1992, USBANCORP recognized the net favorable effect of several
non-recurring items aggregating approximately $138,000. The largest items were a
$737,000 gain from fixed-rate mortgage loan sales and $400,000 of expenses 
incurred for productivity consultants. In 1991, USBANCORP recognized the net 
unfavorable effect of several non-recurring items aggregating approximately 
$325,000, including a $300,000 negative interest accrual adjustment resulting 
from certain clerical errors.

BALANCE SHEET...The Company's total consolidated assets were $1.242 billion at
December 31, 1993, compared with $1.140 billion at December 31, 1992, which 
represents an increase of $102 million or 8.9%. This asset growth was funded 
primarily by $51.3 million of increased deposits, $24.6 million of net cash 
provided from the Company's secondary common stock offering in February 1993 
(see further discussion under "Capital Resources") and $20 million of 
advances from the Federal Home Loan Bank. These funds have been invested in the 
loan and investment security portfolios which have increased by $73.3 million 
and $61.8 million, respectively, since December 31, 1992. A $30.4 million 
reduction in the Company's overnight federal funds sold position also was used 
to fund the observed investment security and loan growth. This planned reduction
in the Company's overnight federal funds sold position resulted from
management's strategy to shift to a federal funds purchased position to enhance 
the net interest margin by better leveraging the investment securities portfolio
in this low interest rate environment.

     As a result of the low rate environment, less inflationary fears, 
improved consumer confidence, and a moderate economic recovery, each of the 
Company's banking subsidiaries experienced heightened loan demand in 1993. 
Within the loan portfolio, each of the major loan categories experienced net 
growth in the following amounts since December 31, 1992:commercial loans up 
by $22.7 million or 29.5%, real estate-mortgage loans up by $39.8 million or
13.3%, consumer loans up by $9.5 million or 6.0%, and commercial loans secured
by real estate up by $200,000 or only .2%. The commercial loan growth resulted
from successful business development efforts in both regions of the Company's 
marketplace which includes suburban Pittsburgh and Greater Johnstown. The net 
growth in mortgage loans (including home equity) occurred despite the sale of 
approximately $22 million of 30-year fixed-rate product that originated during 
1993. The majority of the mortgage growth occurred at Community with 
approximately 60% of this growth related to refinancing activity customers. The 
net growth of consumer loans outstanding is noteworthy since it represents a
significant reversal 

<PAGE>50


of the trend of net consumer loan run-off which had occurred throughout 1992.
Improved consumer demand, acquisition of Integra loans, and heavy marketing of 
debt consolidation loans, combined with a general stabilizing of indirect auto 
loan run-off, were the factors responsible for the increase in consumer loan 
balances.

LOAN QUALITY...USBANCORP's written lending policies require underwriting, loan
documentation, and credit analysis standards to be met prior to funding any
loan. After the loan has been approved and funded, continued periodic credit 
review is required. Annual credit reviews are mandatory for all commercial loans
in excess of $100,000 and for all commercial mortgages in excess of $250,000. In
addition, due to the secured nature of residential mortgages and the smaller 
balances of individual installment loans, sampling techniques on acontinuing 
basis for credit reviews in these loan areas.

     The following table sets forth information concerning USBANCORP's loan
delinquency and other non-performing assets:

(1)Non-performing assets are comprised of (i) loans that are on a non-accrual
basis, (ii) consumer loans that are contractually past due 90 days or more as 
to interest and principal payments and which are insured for credit loss, and 
(iii) other real estate owned, including in-substance foreclosures. All loans, 
except for loans that are insured for credit loss, are placed on non-accrual 
status immediately upon becoming 90 days past due in either principal or 
interest.
</TABLE>

     At December 31, 1993, non-accrual loans and non-performing assets as a
percentage of total loans and loans held for sale, net of unearned income, and 
other real estate owned were 0.73% and 0.89%, respectively. The decreases from 
December 31, 1992, in each of these categories were due primarily to the 
Company's ongoing loan work-out program which has been implemented at each 
banking subsidiary. Overall, total loan delinquency (past due 30 to 89 days)
as a percentage of total loans, net of unearned income, totalled 1.43% at
December 31, 1993, and was relatively stable between years.

     Potential problem loans consist of loans which are included in performing
loans, but for which potential credit problems of the borrowers have caused 
management to have concerns as to the ability of such borrowers to comply with 
present repayment terms. At December 31, 1993, all identified potential problem 
loans were included in the preceding table. 

ALLOWANCE FOR LOAN LOSSES...As a financial institution which assumes lending
and credit risks as a principal element of its business, the Company anticipates
that credit losses will be experienced in the normal course of business.
Accordingly, management of the Company makes a quarterly determination as to an
appropriate provision from earnings necessary to maintain an allowance for loan 
losses that is adequate for potential yet undetermine losses. The amount
charged against earnings is based upon several factors including, at a
minimum, each of the following:

<PAGE>51

- -    a continuing review of delinquent, classified and non-accrual loans,
large loans, and overall portfolio quality. This continuous review assesses the 
risk characteristics of both individual loans and the total loan portfolio.

- -    regular examinations and reviews of the loan portfolio by representatives
of the regulatory authorities.

- -    analytical review of loan charge-off experience, delinquency rates, and
other relevant historical and peer statistical ratios.

- -    management's judgment with respect to local and general economic
conditions and their impact on the existing loan portfolio.

     When it is determined that the prospects for recovery of the principal of
a loan have significantly diminished, the loan is immediately charged against 
the allowance account; subsequent recoveries, if any, are credited to the 
allowance account. In addition, non-accrual and large delinquent loans are 
reviewed monthly to determine potential losses. Consumer loans are considered
losses when they are 90 days past due, except loans that are insured for credit 
loss.

     USBANCORP has no credit exposure to foreign countries, foreign borrowers
or highly leveraged transactions.

     The following table sets forth changes in the allowance for loan losses
and certain ratios for the periods ended:

</TABLE>

     When December 31, 1993, is compared to December 31, 1992, the allowance
coverage ratios for non-accrual loans and non-performing assets increased due to
the previously discussed improvement in the Company's asset quality combined


<PAGE>52


with an increased balance in the allowance for loan losses. The December 31,
1993, allowance to total loans and loans held for sale, net of unearned income,
ratio of 2.10% declined by only two basis points from the December 31, 1992, 
level of 2.12% despite the $78.3 million of growth experienced in the loan 
portfolio. Community's non-performing assets declined by $1.3 million to
$3.0 million at December 31, 1992, due to $1.1 million of loans charged-off
against the allowance for loan losses during the second quarter of 1992. A
substantial portion of Community's loan charge-offs were commercial loans. These
charge-offs, which had been identified as part of the Company's pre-acquisition 
due diligence, were offset by a loan loss provision of $1.3 million at Community
for the period ended December 31, 1992. 

     Typically, as in the case of Community, the loan portfolio of a savings 
and loan association or savings bank contains a high proportion of secured 
residential mortgage and consumer loans which are generally believed to have
less credit risk as compared to commercial loans. Over 80% of Community's loan
portfolio is residential mortgage and consumer loans historically have a lower
charge-off to loans percentage compared to commercial USBANCORP's policies 
require greater allowance coverage for its subsidiaries than was required at
Community prior to its acquisition; in order to make the allowance coverage of 
the loan portfolio consistent with USBANCORP's policy and general banking 
industry levels, management increased the provision for loan losses at Community
in both 1992 and 1993 to build the reserve to conform with USBANCORP policy 
requirements. At December 31, 1993 and 1992, management believed the allowance 
for loan losses was adequate at each subsidiary bank inherent in the portfolio 
at those dates. However, there can be no assurance the quality deteriorates in
future periods material additions to the allowance for loan losses will not be
required.

     USBANCORP's management is unable to determine in what loan category
future charge-offs and recoveries may occur. The following schedule sets forth 
the allocation of the allowance for loan losses among various categories. The 
portion of the allowance allocated to general risk to protect the Company 
against potential yet undetermined losses increased by $2.2 million to $7.6 
million or 50% of the total allowance at December 31, 1993.  This allocation is
based upon historical experience. The entire allowance for loan losses is
available to absorb future loan losses in any loan category.

INTEREST RATE SENSITIVITY...Asset/liability management involves managing the
risks associated with changing interest rates and the resulting impact on the
Company's net interest income. The management and measurement of interest rate
risk at USBANCORP is performed by using the following tools: 1) Static "GAP" 

<PAGE>53


analysis which analyzes the extent to which interest rate sensitive assets and
interest rate sensitive liabilities are matched at specific points in time; 2)
simulation modeling which analyzes the impact of interest rates changes on net
interest income and capital levels over specific future time periods by
projecting the yield performance of assets and liabilities in numerous varied 
interest rate environments.

     For static GAP analysis, USBANCORP typically defines interest rate
sensitive assets and liabilities as those that reprice within one year. 
Maintaining an appropriate match is one method of avoiding wide fluctuations in
net interest margin during periods of changing interest rates. The difference
between rate sensitive assets and rate sensitive liability known as the 
"interest sensitivity GAP." A positive GAPoccurs when rate sensitive assets 
exceed rate sensitive liabilities repricing in the same time period and a 
negative GAP occurs when rate sensitive liabilities exceed rate sensitive assets
repricing in the same time period. A GAP ratio (rate sensitive assets divided
by rate sensitive liabilities) of one indicates a statistically perfect match.
A GAP ratio of less than one suggests that a financial institution may be
better positioned to take advantage of declining interest rates rather than 
increasing interest rates, and a GAP ratio of more than one suggests the
converse. Since 1987, USBANCORP has generally endeavored to one year GAP 
position thereby minimizing the impact (either positive or changing interest 
rates on both net interest income and capital levels. 

     The following table presents a summary of the Company's static GAP

</TABLE>

     There are some inherent limitations in using static GAP analysis to
measure and manage interest rate risk. For instance, certain assets and
liabilities may have similar maturities or periods to repricing but the
magnitude or degree of the repricing may vary significantly with changes in
market interest rates. As a result of these GAP  


<PAGE>54

limitations, management places considerable emphasis on simulation modeling to
manage and measure interest rate risk. At December 31, 1993, these eight varied
economic interest rate simulations indicated that the variability of USBANCORP's
net interest income over the next twelve month period was below the Company's
$PM5% policy limit given positive or negative interest rate changes of up to 250
basis points; indeed these simulations show the greatest variability, $MI3.0%,
in an economic scenario of an extreme immediate 250 basis point decline in
interest rates.

     Beginning September 30, 1992, USBANCORP's investment portfolio was
reclassified as "available for sale." This classification provides management 
with greater flexibility to more actively manage the securities portfolio to
better achieve overall balance sheet rate sensitivity goals. Furthermore, it is 
USBANCORP's intent to continue to diversify Community's loan portfolio to 
increase liquidity and rate sensitivity and to better manage USBANCORP's 
long-term interest rate risk.Specific rate sensitivity strategies were executed
in 1992 as approximately $30 million of Community's fixed rate mortgage loans 
were sold with the proceeds reinvested into rate sensitive investment securities
with a significantly shorter weighted average maturity. This long-term interest 
rate risk reduction strategy continued during 1993 a additional $22 million
of newly originated 30-year fixed rate mortgage loans were sold. Community
retained all servicing rights and will recognize fee income over the remaining
lives of the loans sold at an average rate of approximately 35 basis points on 
the loan balances outstanding. The Company plans to continue to originate and 
sell future fixed rate 30-year mortgages to help manage interest rate risk
and provide a source of recurrent servicing fee income.

LIQUIDITY...Financial institutions must maintain liquidity to meet day-to-day
requirements of depositor and borrower customers, take advantage of market 
opportunities, and provide a cushion against unforeseen needs. Liquidity needs 
can be met by either reducing assets or increasing liabilities. Normal sources 
of asset liquidity are provided by short-term investment securities, time
deposits with banks, federal funds sold, banker's acceptances, and commercial
paper. These assets totaled $151 million at December 31, 1993, compared to $176
million at December 31, 1992. Maturing and repaying loans, as well as, the 
monthly cash flow associated with certain asset- and mortgage-backed securities 
are other sources of asset liquidity. 

     Liability liquidity can be met by attracting deposits with competitive
rates, using repurchase agreements, buying federal funds, or utilizing the 
facilities of the Federal Reserve or the Federal Home Loan Bank systems.
USBANCORP's subsidiaries utilize a variety of these methods of liability
liquidity. At December 31, 1993, USBANCORP's subsidiaries had approximately 
$89.6 million of unused lines of credit available under arrangements with 
correspondent banks compared to $88.6 million at December lines of credit 
enable USBANCORP's subsidiaries to purchase funds for short-term needs at
current market rates. Additionally, each of the Company's subsidiary banks 
are members of the Federal Home Loan Bank which provides the opportunity to 
obtain intermediate to longer-term advances up to approximately 80% of their 
investment in assets secured by one to four family residential real estate;
based upon December 31, 1993, balances, this would suggest available FHLB
borrowing capacity of approximately $504 million. Furthermore, USBANCORP had
available at December 31, 1993, an unused $1 million unsecured line of credit.

     Liquidity can be further analyzed by utilizing the Consolidated Statement
of Cash Flows. Cash equivalents decreased by $32 million from December 31, 1992,
to December 31, 1993. Both the financing and investing activities were
augmentedby the net $76.5 million in cash received from the Integra branches 
acquired. Financing activities were also impacted by the net $24.6 million from
the secondary 


<PAGE>55


common stock offering and the $10 million increase in advances from the
Federal Home Loan Bank. There was a decrease in net cash provided by 
investing activities at December 31, 1993, primarily due to a net increase 
in loans of $78.6 million and a net increase in the investment security 
portfolio of $62.2 million. These increases were due to the redeployment of
Integra funds along with a reduction in the Company's short-term liquid assets.

EFFECTS OF INFLATION...USBANCORP's asset and liability structure is primarily
monetary in nature. As such, USBANCORP's assets and liabilities tend to move 
in concert with inflation. While changes in interest rates may have an impact 
on the financial performance of the banking industry, interest rates do not 
necessarily move in the same direction or in the same magnitude as prices of
other goods and services and may frequently reflect goverment policy 
initiatives or economic factors not measured by a price index.

CAPITAL RESOURCES...Total shareholders' equity at December 31, 1993, was
$116.6 million. This represented an increase of $33.6 million or 40.5% from 
the December 31, 1992, level due to the completion of the secondary common 
stock offering and from the retention of earnings (net of dividends paid) 
during 1993. On February 10, 1993, USBANCORP completed the sale of 1,150,000
shares of common stock at an offering price of $24.50 per share.  This 
provided the Company with $26 million in proceeds after payment of related 
issuance expenses. Approximately $1.4 million of the offering proceeds were
used to redeem the remaining unconverted Series A Preferred Stock on April 7,
1993. Of the offering proceeds, $2 million was downstreamed as a capital 
infusion into Three Rivers Bank on April 5, 1993, in connection with the 
Integra Branches Acquisition to adequately capitalize the $88 million of 
deposits acquired. The remaining offering proceeds of $22.6 million will be 
used by USBANCORP for general corporate purposes and other accepted 
shareholder total return enhancement strategies. Specifically, in 1994 the 
Company will use approximately $20 million of these funds to assist in the 
financing of the JSB acquisition. The following table highlights the 
Company's compliance with the required regulatory capital ratios for each of 
the periods presented:

     As the previous table indicates, the Company exceeds all regulatory
capital ratios for each of the periods presented. The significant increase in 
each of the regulatory capital ratios at December 31, 1993, was a direct 
result of the successful secondary common stock offering discussed earlier. 
Furthermore, each of the Company's subsidiary banks are considered "well
capitalized" under all applicable FDIC regulations. While remaining committed
to maintaining this "well capitalized" designation, the Company will 
prudently pursue throughout 1994 appropriate strategies to improve its 
leveraging and use of capital to enhance total shareholder return.

     The Company's declared common stock cash dividend per share was $.86 for
1993 which was a 14.7% increase over the $.75 per share dividend for 1992. 
The current dividend yield on the Company's common stock now approximates 
3.5% compared to an average Pennsylvania bank holding company yield of 
approximately 2.5%. The Company remains committed to a progressive total 
shareholder return which includes a competitive common dividend yield.

FUTURE OUTLOOK...The Company will look to build upon the successes achieved in
1993 as we begin to address the challenges and opportunities of 1994. Numerous
strategies are being explored to ensure that the Company continues to provide 
a progressive total shareholder return. Paramount among the challenges faced 
is the Company's desire to better leverage its capital strength. The 
successful acquisition of JSB, which is expected to be consummated by the end of
the second quarter of 1994, will be a key element in helping to leverage the
Company's capital base. The Company will also leverage its capital base by a 
more extensive use of the borrowing capabilities available from the Federal 
Home Loan Bank now that each of its subsidiary banks is a member. In 1994, 
USBANCORP will also execute its announced treasury stock repurchase
program with the intent, dependent upon market circumstances, to buy back up
to 5% of the total common shares outstanding. Management will continue to 
re-evaluate its dividend policies throughout the year in an ongoing effort to 
ensure a competitive dividend yield. Each of these actions will be directed
to the goal of improved capital usage and leverage.

     The Company also expects to improve its core financial performance by
focusing on several key areas in 1994: continued diversification of the 
earning asset mix emphasizing more reliance on loans rather than investments 
as a source of return; restructuring of the investment portfolio to obtain 
yield enhancements while maintaining credit quality and adequate liquidity;
careful, policy-controlled use of hedging tools such as derivative products to
aid in the overall management of interest rate and market value risk; 
continued growth of key non-interest income generating businesses such as the 
Trust Company, mortgage servicing, and the wholesale cash processing division;
diligent control of non-interest expense growth with ongoing focus on 
achieving further productivity improvements; and reduced loan loss provision
levels provided that the Company continues to maintain better than peer asset
quality and net charge-off levels. Successful execution of these strategies 
will provide for growth in earnings per share which the Company believes is a
critical element to enhancing total shareholder value. Without the JSB
acquisition, which will initially be moderately dilutive to earnings per share
(exclusive of certain non-recurring acquisition charges) and book value, and 
prior to consideration of the effect of the SFAS NO.109 benefit in 1993, 
management generally expects to recognize an earnings per share improvement 
of between 7.5% and 10.0% in 1994.

<PAGE>57

     Overall corporate performance in 1994 will be greatly affected by the
consummation of the JSB acquisition which is expected to occur during the
second quarter of 1994. USBANCORP anticipates recognizing approximately six 
months of earnings in 1994 from this latest acquisition; for the year ended 
December 31, 1993, JSB reported net income of $3,361,000.  The Company
will also recognize monthly after-tax purchase accounting net charges of
approximately $120,000.  Additionally, non-recurring acquisition expenses, 
including such items as severance and professional fees, will be recognized in 
the quarter of consummation and are estimated to approximate $1,700,000 
after-tax. Finally, the Company will issue approximately 982,000 additional 
common shares to effect the merger. Each of these items in significant
impact to the financial performance reported by USBANCORP during 1994.
Management continues to believe that the JSB acquisition will become accretive 
to the Company's earnings during 1996 once all cost reductions and earnings 
enhancement opportunities have been successfully identified and implemented.
