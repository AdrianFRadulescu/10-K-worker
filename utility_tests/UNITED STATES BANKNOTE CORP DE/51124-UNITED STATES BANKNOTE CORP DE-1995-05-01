     (1)  The value of each of the named executive officer's perquisites
          did not exceed the threshold for disclosure established under the
          Securities and Exchange Commission's proxy rules.

     (2)  No named executive officers held any restricted stock at December
          31, 1994.  Amounts shown represent 91,875 shares of restricted
          stock valued at $2.00 per share awarded on March 27, 1995
          representing 50% of Mr. Weissman's 1994 bonus under the Executive
          Incentive Plan.  Restrictions lapse on one-third of the shares
          upon each of the first three anniversaries of the date of award,
          except that all such restricted stock immediately vests upon Mr.
          Weissman's death, retirement, disability, termination or upon a
          "change in control."  Such shares are held pursuant to a grantor
          trust established by the Company and subject to claims of the
          Company's creditors until the date restrictions on the shares
          lapse.  Dividends are paid on these shares as, when and if
          dividends are paid on Common Stock.

     (3)  Of the options shown for 1992, Messrs. Weissman, Gorman,
          Christophersen and Kesner received 237,500, 38,000, 23,750 and
          19,000 options, respectively, in respect of the Company's 1991
          performance, although such options were granted during fiscal
          year 1992.

                              EMPLOYMENT AGREEMENTS

               Messrs. Weissman and Glover serve pursuant to employment
     agreements with the Company through December 31, 1999 for Mr. Weissman
     and December 31, 1998 for Mr. Glover.  Mr. Weissman's agreement is
     subject to automatic extension unless advance notice of non-renewal is
     given.

               Mr. Weissman's agreement provides for his engagement as
     Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of the Company.  The agreement
     provides a base salary of $750,000 with no guaranteed bonus. 
     Mr. Weissman participates in the Executive Incentive Plan and receives
     an annual bonus equal to 6% of his annual base salary in 1994
     (adjusted in each subsequent year by compounding the 1994 base salary
     by 1.07) multiplied by the number of percentage points by which "ROE"
     (as defined below) exceeds 10% up to a maximum annual bonus equal to
     200% of base salary. 

               Mr. Glover's agreement provides for his engagement as
     President and Chief Operating Officer of the Company.  The agreement
     provides a base salary of $400,000.  Mr. Glover participates in the
     Executive Incentive Plan and receives an annual bonus equal to 3% of
     his annual base salary in 1994 (adjusted in each subsequent year by
     compounding the 1994 base salary by 1.07) multiplied by the number of
     percentage points by which ROE exceeds 10% up to a maximum annual
     bonus equal to 200% of base salary with a minimum bonus of $150,000 in
     1994.

               ROE is defined as the fraction the numerator of which is
     equal to the Company's pre-tax income (including income from minority
     holdings, joint ventures, dividends from investments, and like income)
     before extraordinary charges or similar one-time non-recurring losses
     or reserves not in the ordinary course plus depreciation and
     amortization, and the denominator of which is calculated as a simple
     average of the average monthly common equity (beginning of month
     common equity plus end of month common equity divided by two) for the
     calendar year.

<PAGE>
     

               Mr. Weissman's and Mr. Glover's agreements also contain
     provisions for payment in the event of disability or death in addition
     to maintenance of certain life insurance and participation in Company
     benefit plans.  Upon termination in the event of his permanent
     disability, each is entitled to receive until the earlier to occur of
     (i) recovery from such disability, (ii) the date employment under the
     employment agreement was scheduled to terminate or (iii) death, 75% of
     the then effective base salary.  In addition, each is to receive the
     pro rata amount of the bonus he would have received for the year in
     which he became permanently disabled based on the number of days he
     was not disabled and during the time he receives 75% of his base
     salary all other benefits he would have received but for the
     termination of employment due to disability.

               In the event Mr. Weissman's employment with the Company is
     terminated by the Company (other than for cause) or is terminated by
     Mr. Weissman for "good reason," Mr. Weissman is entitled to receive a
     lump sum equal to the greater of his "Total Direct Compensation" for
     1994 or his "Estimated Total Direct Compensation" then in effect, as
     if his employment agreement had remained in effect for the entire Term
     (as extended pursuant to the agreement) (or, if following a "change in
     control," the greater of such amount or $5,000,000), plus the value of
     his unexercised options and maintenance of certain benefits for the
     remainder of the Term.

               In the event Mr. Glover's employment with the Company is
     terminated by the Company (other than for cause) or is terminated by
     Mr. Glover for "good reason," Mr. Glover is entitled to receive a lump
     sum equal to the greater of two times his "Total Direct Compensation"
     then in effect or the aggregate base salary plus bonus he would have
     received through December 31, 1998 assuming his bonus in each year
     equalled 100% of his base salary at the time of termination, plus
     maintenance of certain benefits for the lesser of two years or the
     remainder of the Term.  In the event Mr. Glover's employment is
     terminated by the Company following a "change in control," Mr. Glover
     is entitled to receive a lump sum equal to three times his Total
     Direct Compensation then in effect, plus the value of his unexercised
     options and maintenance of certain benefits for the remainder of the
     Term.

               Employment agreements for the other named executive officers
     provide for base salaries in 1994 of $234,168, $184,896 and $151,440
     for Messrs. Gorman, Christophersen and Kesner, respectively and
     terminate on July 25, 1995 for Messrs. Gorman and Christophersen and
     December 31, 1994 for Mr. Kesner.  

               For 1994, Messrs. Gorman and Christophersen receive a
     minimum annual bonus in an amount equal to the greater of (i) .4% and
     .27%, respectively, of EBITDA (the Company's consolidated earnings
     before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization, subject to
     certain adjustments and excluding extraordinary charges or similar
     one-time non-recurring losses or reserves not in the ordinary course)
     plus certain extraordinary gains on disposition of assets or (ii) 35%
     and 30%, respectively, of base salary  and Mr. Kesner receives a
     minimum annual bonus of 20% of his base salary.

               Each of the employment agreements for Messrs. Gorman,
     Christophersen and Kesner contains provisions for payment in the event
     of non-renewal by the Company, disability or death in addition to
     maintenance of certain life insurance and participation in Company
     benefit plans.

               The employment agreements entitle Messrs. Gorman,
     Christophersen and Kesner to certain payments upon termination of the
     "Term of Employment" under their respective agreements (other than for
     cause).  Payment upon termination of the "Term of Employment" includes
     a two year consulting period for Messrs. Gorman and Christophersen at
     50% of their base salaries then in effect and for Mr. Kesner, a lump
     sum of one times base salary then in effect.  Upon termination in
     certain circumstances, including for "good reason" (defined as certain
     events following a "change in control"), payment includes a lump sum
     of two times

     base salary plus bonus then in effect for Messrs. Gorman and
     Christophersen and one times base salary plus bonus then in effect for
     Mr. Kesner, plus the value of unexercised options held and maintenance
     of certain benefits for an eighteen month period.

(1)     Options granted to Messrs. Gorman, Christophersen and Kesner were granted under the Long-Term Performance Plan and
        options granted to Mr. Glover were granted under the 1990 Stock Option Plan.  One-third of the options vest and become
        fully exercisable upon each of the first three anniversaries of the date of grant (September 20, 1994 with respect to
        options granted to Messrs. Gorman, Christophersen and Kesner and April 5, 1994 with respect to options granted to Mr.
        Glover), except that all such options immediately vest upon the holder's death while still employed or termination of
        employment in connection with a change in control.  Payment of the purchase price for shares acquired upon the
        exercise of options generally may be in cash, by check, or by delivery to the Company of shares of Common Stock, or by
        other permitted methods, including broker-assisted "cashless exercise" methods.

(2)     The amounts set forth are based on assumed appreciation of 0% and the 5% and 10% rates as prescribed by the Securities
        and Exchange Commission rules and are not intended to forecast future appreciation, if any, of the stock price.  The
        Company did not use an alternate formula for a grant date valuation as it is not aware of any formula which will
        determine with reasonable accuracy a present value based on future unknown or volatile factors.  Actual gains, if any,
        on stock option exercises and Common Stock holdings are dependent on the future performance of the Common Stock. 
        There can be no assurance that the amounts reflected in this table will be achieved.

                                 RETIREMENT PLAN

               Effective April 1, 1994, the Board of Directors approved the
     implementation of a retirement plan for certain executives and
     management employees (the "Supplemental Executive Retirement Plan"). 
     In general, the Supplemental Executive Retirement Plan provides that a
     participant retiring at age 65 will receive a monthly retirement
     benefit equal to an amount determined by multiplying the participant's
     "final average compensation" (as defined in the plan) by a percentage
     equal to 3% for each of the first ten years of a participant's service
     plus 1.5% for each of the next twenty years of the participant's
     service.  The result of the computation shall be decreased by a
     participant's Social Security Benefit and any amount available from
     the participant's basic pension or profitsharing plan resulting from
     employer contributions.  The retirement income shall be paid at normal
     or deferred retirement date for life only with the appropriate
     actuarial reduction of a joint and survivor election.  Early
     retirement benefits are available with a reduction of 2% for each year
     less than age 62.  No benefit will be provided previous to a
     participant achieving age 55 and 10 years of service.  All
     participants will receive credit for past service to the Company or
     any of its wholly-owned subsidiaries.  Amounts of compensation in
     excess of $300,000 increased by 6% on each plan anniversary commencing
     April 1, 1995, will not be considered when calculating plan benefits.

           Effective April 1, 1994, Mr. Weissman's benefit in the
     Supplemental Executive Retirement Plan will be calculated based upon
     fixed remuneration of $750,000.  Effective May 1, 1994, Mr. Glover's
     benefit will


<PAGE>

<PAGE>
     

     be a fixed retirement income of $225,000 without reduction for any
     other benefits.  Both Messrs. Weissman and Glover will be required to
     provide minimum numbers of service years as provided in their
     respective agreements.

               The Company has established a grantor trust to which the
     Company shall contribute assets that will be held subject to the claim
     of the Company's creditors until paid to plan participants and their
     beneficiaries at such times as specified in the plan.

               The following table shows the estimated annual benefit
     payable to employees in various compensation and years of service
     categories.  The estimated benefits apply to an employee retiring at
     age sixty-five in 1994 who elects to receive his or her benefit in the
     form of a single life annuity.  These benefits would be reduced by any
     benefits attributable to the Company's contributions (and the earnings
     thereon) to the basic pension and/or profit sharing plan and social
     security.

                            COMPENSATION OF DIRECTORS

               Non-employee Directors presently are paid $25,000 per annum
     for serving as Directors and $2,000 for each meeting of the Board of
     Directors attended in excess of four in any fiscal year.  Non-employee
     Directors receive $1,000 for each committee meeting attended.  Under
     the Company's 1992 Non-employee Directors Stock Option Plan (the "1992
     Directors Plan"), Messrs. Goldsmith, Hechler and Rowe-Beddoe have each
     been granted options for 15,000 shares.  Under the 1992 Directors
     Plan, the options become fully exercisable upon the termination of the
     holder as a Director of the Company due to death, disability or
     retirement or upon a change of control.  Payment of the purchase price
     for shares acquired upon the exercise of options may be in cash, by
     check or by delivery to the Company of shares of Common Stock,
     including broker-assisted "cashless exercise" methods.  No options
     granted under the 1992 Directors Plan have been exercised and no
     further grants will be made under the 1992 Directors Plan.  Under the
     terms of the Deferred Stock and Compensation Plan for Non-employee
     Directors (the "Director Plan"), each non-employee director elected at
     an annual meeting is automatically awarded 1,300 Common Stock share
     equivalents, which are held in a director's deferred stock account. 
     Directors elected or appointed other than at an annual meeting are
     awarded a pro rata amount of Common Stock share equivalents.  A Common
     Stock share equivalent is the hypothetical equivalent of the Common
     Stock that has a value on any date equal to the mean of the high and
     low trading prices of the Common Stock on such date, and is adjusted
     to reflect stock dividends, splits and reclassifications.  In January
     of the year following the year of termination of services, each
     director receives payment in shares of Common Stock equal to the
     balance of Common Stock share equivalents in his or her deferred stock
     account.  In the event of a change in control, share equivalents have
     a value based on the highest price of the Common Stock during the
     thirty days preceding such change in control and will be paid in cash
     or otherwise as the Compensation Committee may
<PAGE>

<PAGE>
     

     prescribe.  As a result of the Director Plan, 1,300 Common Stock share
     equivalents were awarded to each of Ms. Anderson and Messrs.
     Goldsmith, Hechler and Rowe-Beddoe on June 6, 1994.

               Under the Director Plan a non-employee director may elect to
     defer all or a portion of such director's annual retainer and other
     fees, and such deferred amount is treated as if it were invested in a
     putative debenture and credited to a deferred debenture account.  A
     putative debenture is a hypothetical debenture of the Company that has
     a face value of $100, and bears interest at a rate equal to the seven
     year U.S. Treasury Bond rate in effect the week prior to the regular
     January meeting of the Board.  The debentures are convertible into
     Common Stock at a conversion rate determined by dividing $100 by the
     mean of the high and low trading prices of the Common Stock on the
     date the putative debenture is credited to the director's deferred
     debenture account.  An election to defer shall be effective only with
     regard to annual retainer and fees earned no earlier than six months
     following the director's election except as otherwise provided under
     the Director Plan.  An election shall be irrevocable with regard to
     annual retainer and fees earned during the period in which the
     election is in effect.  Following termination of service, the director
     will receive, in respect of all amounts deferred under the Director
     Plan, five annual payments in cash if the value of the putative
     debentures, plus the interest accrued thereon, is greater than the
     value of the common Stock into which the putative debentures are
     convertible.  Otherwise such amount shall be payable in Common Stock. 
     In the event of a change in control, the deferred amounts will be paid
     in cash or otherwise as the Compensation Committee may prescribe.
