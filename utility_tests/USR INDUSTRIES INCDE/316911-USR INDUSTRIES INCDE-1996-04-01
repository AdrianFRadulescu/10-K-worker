               Re:  USR Industries, Inc. Report on Form 10-K for
                    Year Ended December 31, 1995

Dear Gentlepersons:

    Enclosed please find Form NT-10K Notification of Late Filing by USR
Industries, Inc. (the "Company") of its Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year
ended December 31, 1995.

    The Company is currently in the process of negotiating a possible "global
settlement" intended to resolve long-standing environmental litigation matters
stemming from the era of World War I, in which substantial claims have been
asserted by plaintiffs including the Nuclear Regulatory Commission and the EPA.
For its part, the Company has won litigated settlements from insurers to date
that total substantially in excess of the Company's net worth or its assets. The
Company applied part of these amounts to settle litigation, and the balance has
been contributed to establish a multi-million dollar trust fund for payment of
unresolved claims. Such resolution would be realized based on the global
settlement as above.

    The financial position of the Company remains adversely affected by these
matters. The Company's financial resources and personnel levels have been
reduced to near-bankruptcy levels. The Company's common stock is no longer
listed on a stock exchange for trading, and there is no current market for the
Company's securities. Having devoted its resources primarily to retaining jobs
and holding viable operations at its plant in rural Bloomsburg, Pennsylvania,
the Company is without resources necessary to continue to engage its independent
auditor, Coopers & Lybrand, and is delinquent in certain filings of periodic
reports required under Section 13 and 15(d) of the Securities Exchange Act of
1934.

    The Company is attempting to bring all such delinquent filings current.
However, to do so to meet the March 31, 1996 filing deadline would result in
unreasonable effort and expense in light of the Company's current financial
condition, and the complexity of the environmental litigation.

    The Company has retained independent contractors formerly employed as
certified public accountants on the audit side of leading public accounting
firms to assist in preparation of the necessary reports.

                                        Very truly yours,

                                        RALPH T. McELVENNY, JR.
                                        For: USR Industries, Inc.
                                        (Authorized Person)

                           PART IV--OTHER INFORMATION

(1) Name and telephone number of person to contact in regard to this
    notification

    RALPH T. McELVENNY, JR.       713               622-9171
             (Name)           (Area Code)      (Telephone Number)

(2) Have all other periodic reports required under Section 13
    or 15(d) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 or
    Section 30 of the Investment Company Act of 1940 during
    the preceding 12 months (or for such shorter) period that
    the registrant was required to file such reports)
    been filed? If answer is no, identify report(s).            [ ] Yes  [X] No

    12/31/94 Form 10-K and 3/31/95, 6/30/95 and 9/30/95 Form 10-Q's

(3) Is it anticipated that any significant change in results
    of operations from the corresponding period for the last
    fiscal year will be reflected by the earnings statements
    to be included in the subject report or portion thereof?    [ ] Yes  [X] No

    If so, attach an explanation of the anticipated change, both
    narratively and quantitatively, and, if appropriate, state the
    reasons why a reasonable estimate of the results cannot be made.

                              USR INDUSTRIES, INC.
                  (Name of Registrant as Specified in Charter)
