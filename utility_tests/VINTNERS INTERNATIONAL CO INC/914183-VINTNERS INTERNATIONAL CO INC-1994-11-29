  Item 1. Business
   
      Unless the context otherwise requires, the term "Company" refers to
  Canandaigua Wine Company, Inc. and its subsidiaries, all references to
  "net sales" refer to gross revenues less excise taxes and returns and
  allowances to conform with the Company's method of classification, and
  all references to the Company's fiscal year shall refer to the year ended
  August 31 of the indicated year. Market share and industry data disclosed
  in this Report have been obtained from the following industry
  publications: Wines & Vines; The Gomberg-Fredrikson Report; Jobson's
  Liquor Handbook; Jobson's Wine Handbook; The U.S. Wine Market: Impact
  Databank Review and Forecast, 1994 Edition; The U.S. Beer Market: Impact
  Databank Review and Forecast, 1994 Edition; Beer Marketer's Insights:
  1994 Import Insights; and 1994 Beer Industry Update. The Company has not
  independently verified this data. References to market share data are
  based on unit volume. 

      The Company is a Delaware corporation organized in 1972 as the
  successor to a business founded in 1945 by Marvin Sands, Chairman of the
  Board of the Company.

      The Company is a leading producer and marketer of branded beverage
  alcohol products, with over 125 national and regional brands which are
  distributed by over 1,000 wholesalers throughout the United States and in
  selected international markets. The Company is the second largest
  supplier of wines, the fourth largest importer of beers and the eighth
  largest supplier of distilled spirits in the United States. The Company's
  beverage alcohol brands are marketed in five general categories: table
  wines, sparkling wines, dessert wines, imported beer and distilled
  spirits, and include the following principal brands:
   
    . Table Wines: Almaden, Inglenook, Paul Masson, Taylor California
  Cellars, Cribari,   
      Manischewitz, Taylor New York, Marcus James, Deer Valley and 
  Dunnewood
   
    . Sparkling Wines: Cook's, J. Roget, Great Western and Taylor New York

    . Dessert Wines: Richards Wild Irish Rose, Cisco, Taylor New York and
      Italian Swiss
      Colony
   
    . Imported Beer: Corona, St. Pauli Girl, Modelo Especial, Tsingtao and
  Pacifico
   
    . Distilled Spirits: Barton's Gin and Vodka, Ten High Bourbon Whiskey,
      Crystal Palace Gin and Vodka, Montezuma Tequila, Northern Light
      Canadian Whisky, Lauder's Scotch Whisky and Monte Alban Mezcal

      Based on available industry data, the Company believes it has a 21%
  share of the wine market, a 10% share of the imported beer market and a
  4% share of the distilled spirits market in the United States. Within the
  wine market, the Company believes it has a 31% share of the non-varietal
  table wine market, a 10% share of the varietal table wine market, a 50%
  share of the dessert wine market and a 32% share of the sparkling wine
<PAGE>

  market. Many of the Company's brands are leaders in their respective
  categories in the United States, including Corona, the second largest
  selling imported beer brand, Almaden and Inglenook, the fifth and sixth
  largest selling wine brands, Richards Wild Irish Rose, the largest
  selling dessert wine brand, Cook's champagne, the second largest selling
  sparkling wine brand, Montezuma, the second largest selling tequila
  brand, and Monte Alban, the largest selling mezcal brand.  
   
      During the past four years, the Company has diversified its product
  portfolio through a series of strategic acquisitions that have resulted
  in an increase in the Company's net sales from $176.6 million in fiscal
  1991 to $876.4 million on a pro forma basis in fiscal 1994. Through these
  acquisitions, the Company acquired strong market positions in growing
  product categories in the beverage alcohol industry, such as varietal
  table wine and imported beer. The Company ranks second and fourth in the
  varietal table wine and imported beer categories, respectively. Over the
  past four years, industry shipments of varietal table wine and imported
  beer have grown 64% and 7%, respectively. The Company has successfully
  integrated the acquired businesses into its existing business and
  achieved significant cost reductions through reduced product and
  organizational costs. The Company has also strengthened its relationship
  with wholesalers, expanded its distribution and enhanced its production
  capabilities as well as acquired additional management, operational,
  marketing and research and development expertise.
   
      In October 1991, the Company acquired the Cook's, Cribari, Dunnewood
  and other brands and related facilities and assets (the "Guild
  Acquisition") from Guild Wineries and Distillers ("Guild"), which enabled
  the Company to establish a significant market position in the California
  sparkling wine category and to enter the California table wine market.
  The Company acquired Barton Incorporated ("Barton") in June 1993, further
  diversifying into the imported beer and distilled spirits categories (the
  "Barton Acquisition"). On October 15, 1993, the Company acquired the Paul
  Masson, Taylor California Cellars and other brands and related facilities
  and assets of Vintners International Company, Inc. ("Vintners") (the
  "Vintners Acquisition"). On August 5, 1994, the Company acquired the
  Almaden, Inglenook and other brands, a grape juice concentrate business
  and related facilities and assets (the "Almaden/Inglenook Product Lines")
  from Heublein Inc. (the "Almaden/Inglenook Acquisition," and together
  with the Barton Acquisition and the Vintners Acquisition, the
  "Acquisitions"). See "Recent Acquisitions."
   
      The Company's business strategy is to continue to strengthen its
  market position in each of its principal product lines. Key elements of
  its strategy include: (i) making selective acquisitions in the beverage
  alcohol industry to improve market position and capitalize on growth
  trends within the industry; (ii) improving operating efficiencies through
  reduced product and organizational costs of existing and acquired
  businesses; (iii) capitalizing on strong wholesaler relationships
  resulting from its expanded portfolio of brands; and (iv) expanding
  distribution into new markets and increasing penetration of existing
  markets primarily through line extensions and promotional activities. 
   
      In furtherance of its business strategy of improving operating
  efficiencies of acquired businesses, the Company announced a plan to
  restructure the operations of its California wineries, including a
  consolidation of facilities, centralization of bottling operations and
<PAGE>

  reduction of overhead, including the elimination of approximately 260
  jobs (the "Restructuring Plan"). As a result of the Restructuring Plan,
  the Company has taken a charge in the fourth quarter of fiscal 1994 which
  reduced after-tax income for fiscal 1994 by $14.9 million, or $0.91 per
  share on a fully diluted basis. The Company anticipates that the
  Restructuring Plan will result in net cost savings of approximately $1.7
  million in fiscal 1995 and approximately $13.3 million of annual net cost
  savings beginning in fiscal 1996. See "Management's Discussion and
  Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations."

  RECENT ACQUISITIONS
   
      The Barton Acquisition. On June 29, 1993, the Company acquired all of
  the outstanding shares of capital stock of Barton. Barton is the United
  States' fourth largest importer of beers and eighth largest supplier of
  distilled spirits. The Barton Acquisition has enabled the Company to
  diversify within the beverage alcohol industry by participating in the
  imported beer and distilled spirits markets, which have similar marketing
  approaches and distribution channels to the Company's wine business, and
  to take advantage of the experienced management team that developed
  Barton as a successful company. With this acquisition, the Company
  acquired the right to distribute Corona and Modelo Especial beer in 25
  primarily western states, national distribution rights for St. Pauli Girl
  and Tsingtao and a diversified line of distilled spirits including Barton
  Gin and Vodka, Ten High Bourbon Whiskey and Montezuma Tequila.
   
      Barton is being operated independently by its current management as a
  subsidiary of the Company. Until August 31, 1996, consistent with past
  practices and subject to annual approval by the Company's Board of
  Directors of an annual operating plan for the coming year, Ellis M.
  Goodman, the Chief Executive Officer of Barton, has full and exclusive
  strategic and operational responsibility for Barton and all of its
  subsidiaries.
   
      The Vintners Acquisition. On October 15, 1993, the Company acquired
  substantially all of the assets of Vintners, and assumed certain
  liabilities. Vintners was the United States' fifth largest supplier of
  wine with two of the country's most highly recognized brands, Paul Masson
  and Taylor California Cellars. The Vintners Acquisition enabled the
  Company to expand its wine portfolio to include several large and highly
  recognized table wine brands that are distributed by a substantially
  common wholesaler network. Vintners' operations were immediately
  integrated with those of the Company at the closing of the acquisition.
  With this acquisition, the Company acquired the Paul Masson, Taylor
  California Cellars, Taylor New York, Deer Valley, St. Regis (non-
  alcoholic) and Great Western brands and related facilities.
    
      The Almaden/Inglenook Acquisition. On August 5, 1994, the Company
  acquired the Almaden and Inglenook brands, the fifth and sixth largest
  selling table wines in the United States, a grape juice concentrate
  business, and wineries in Madera and Escalon, California, from Heublein.
  The Company also acquired Belaire Creek Cellars, Chateau La Salle and
  Charles Le Franc table wines, Le Domaine champagne and Almaden, Hartley
  and Jacques Bonet brandy. The accounts receivable and the accounts
  payable related to the acquired assets were not acquired by the Company.  
                                         
   
<PAGE>

      As a result of the Almaden/Inglenook Acquisition, the Company has
  strengthened its position as the second largest supplier of wines in the
  United States. The acquisition of the Inglenook brand significantly
  expands the Company's restaurant and bar on-premises presence. The
  Company intends to maintain the existing sales force and distribution
  network of the Almaden and Inglenook brands. Further, the
  Almaden/Inglenook Acquisition has resulted in the Company becoming the
  leading grape juice concentrate producer in the United States. The
  Company believes that the Almaden/Inglenook Acquisition will enable the
  Company to achieve significant cost savings through the consolidation of
  its California winery operations. 
   
      Heublein also agreed not to compete with the Company in the United
  States and Canada for a period of five years following the closing of the
  Almaden/Inglenook Acquisition in the production and sale of grape juice
  concentrate or sale of packaged wines bearing the designation "Chablis"
  or "Burgundy" except where, among other exceptions, such designations are
  currently used with certain brands retained by Heublein. Certain
  companies acquired by Heublein, however, may compete directly with the
  Company.


  INDUSTRY

      The beverage alcohol industry in the United States consists of the
  production, importation, marketing and distribution of beer, wine and
  distilled spirits products. Over the past five years there has been
  increasing consolidation at the supplier, wholesaler and, in some
  markets, retailer tiers of the beverage alcohol industry. As a result, it
  has become advantageous for certain suppliers to expand their portfolio
  of brands through acquisitions and internal development in order to take
  advantage of economies of scale and to increase their importance to a
  more limited number of wholesalers and, in some markets, retailers. From
  1978 through 1993, the overall per capita consumption of beverage alcohol
  products in the United States has generally declined. However, table
  wines, and in particular varietal table wines, and imported beer
  consumption have increased during the period. 
<PAGE>

      The following table sets forth the industry unit volumes for
  shipments of beverage alcohol products in the Company's five principal
  beverage alcohol product categories in the United States for the five
  calendar years ended December 31, 1993:
<TABLE>

</TABLE>

                                               
  (a) Units are in thousands of gallons. Data exclude sales of wine
  coolers.
  (b) Includes other special natural (flavored) wines under 14% alcohol.
  (c) Includes dessert wines, other special natural (flavored) wines over
      14%
      alcohol and vermouth.
  (d) Units are in thousands of cases (2.25 gallons per case).
  (e) Units are in thousands of 9-liter cases (2.378 gallons per case).
   
      Table Wines. Wines containing 14% or less alcohol by volume are
  generally referred to as table wines. Within this category, table wines
  are further characterized as either "non-varietal" or "varietal." Non-
  varietal wines include wines named after the European regions where
  similar types of wines were originally produced (e.g., burgundy), niche
  products and proprietary brands. Varietal wines are those named for the
  grape that comprises the principal component of the wine. Table wines
  that retail at less than $5.75 per 750 ml. bottle are generally
  considered to be popularly priced while those that retail at $5.75 or
  more per 750 ml. bottle are considered premium wines.
   
      From 1989 to 1993, shipments of domestic table wines increased at an
  average compound annual rate of approximately 1.5%. In 1992, domestic
  table wine shipments increased 8% from the previous year; this rate of
  increase was markedly larger than in previous years and was attributed in
  large part to the November 1991 CBS television 60 Minutes, French Paradox
  broadcast about the healthful benefits of moderate red wine consumption.
  In 1993, domestic table wine shipments declined by 2.3% when compared to
  1992. This decline has been attributed to an overall wholesale and retail
  wine inventory surplus at the end of 1992. Based on shipments of
  California table wines, which constituted approximately 94% of the total
  domestically produced table wine market in 1993, shipments of varietal
  wines have grown at an average compound annual rate of 13.3% since 1989,
  with shipments in the first half of 1994 increasing 16% over the prior
  year. In contrast, shipments of non-varietal table wines have generally
  declined over the same period although they showed a slight increase in
<PAGE>

  1992 as compared to 1991. For the first half of calendar 1994, shipments
  of California table wines increased approximately 7% over the same period
  in 1993. Shipments of imported table wines have generally decreased over
  the last six years, decreasing from 58.9 million gallons in 1989 to 52.4
  million gallons in 1993. Imported table wines constituted 15% of the
  United States table wine market in calendar 1993.  

      Dessert Wines. Wines containing more than 14% alcohol by volume are
  generally referred to as dessert wines. Dessert wines generally fall into
  the same price categories as table wines. Dessert wine consumption in the
  United States has been declining for many years reflecting a general
  shift in consumer preferences to table and sparkling wines. For calendar
  year 1993, shipments of domestic dessert wines decreased 9.9% over
  calendar year 1992, a lesser rate than from 1989 to 1993, during which
  period shipments of domestic dessert wines declined at an average
  compound annual rate of 14.2%. Dessert wines, which are generally
  popularly priced, have been adversely affected by the January 1, 1991
  increase in federal excise taxes which had the effect of increasing the
  cost of these products to the consumer disproportionately with certain
  other beverage alcohol products. Shipments of dessert wines continued to
  decline during the first half of calendar 1994 as compared to the first
  half of calendar 1993 as is evidenced by a 7% decline during this period
  in shipments of California dessert wines, which constituted approximately
  73% of the domestically produced dessert wine market in 1993.
   
      Sparkling Wines. Sparkling wines include effervescent wines like
  champagne and spumante. Sparkling wines generally fall into the same
  price categories as table wines. Shipments of sparkling wines declined at
  an average compound annual rate of 2.9% from 1989 to 1993; with shipments
  of domestic sparkling wines declining 0.8% in calendar 1993 as compared
  to calendar 1992. The decline in sparkling wine consumption is believed
  to reflect mounting concerns about drinking and driving, as a large part
  of sparkling wine consumption occurs outside the home at social
  gatherings and restaurants. Shipments of sparkling wines continued to
  decline during the first half of 1994 as compared to the first half of
  1993 as is evidenced by a decline of 12% during this period in shipments
  of California sparkling wines which constituted approximately 92% of the
  domestically produced sparkling wine market in 1993. The Company believes
  that shipments in the first half of 1994 were also adversely affected by
  high levels of retail inventory at the beginning of the period.

      Imported Beer. Shipments of imported beers have increased at an
  average compound annual rate of 1.7% from 1989 to 1993. Shipments of
  Mexican beers in calendar 1993 increased 10.4% over 1992. During the
  first half of calendar 1994 as compared to the corresponding period in
  1993, shipments of Mexican beers increased 14.5% as compared to an
  increase of 19.3% for the entire imported beer category. In 1993,
  imported beers constituted 4.9% of the United States beer market. This
  reflects an increase from 1992 when imported beers constituted 4.4% of
  the United States beer market. Imported beers are generally priced above
  the leading domestic premium brands. This price category also includes
  beers produced by microbreweries and super-premium priced domestic beers.
   
      Distilled Spirits. Shipments of distilled spirits in the United
  States declined at an average compound annual rate of 1.9% from 1989 to
  1993. Although shipments increased slightly in calendar 1992 as compared
  to calendar 1991, shipments again declined in calendar 1993 by 2.6% when
<PAGE>

  compared to calendar 1992. Shipments of distilled spirits have been
  affected by many of the same trends evident in the rest of the beverage
  alcohol industry. Over the past five years, whiskey sales have declined
  significantly while sales of rum, tequila, cordials and liqueurs have
  increased. The Company believes that distilled spirits can be divided
  into two general price segments, with distilled spirits selling for less
  than $7.00 a 750 ml. bottle being referred to as price value products and
  those selling for over $7.00 a 750 ml. bottle being referred to as
  premium products.


  PRODUCT CATEGORIES
   
      The Company produces, imports and markets beverage alcohol products
  in five principal product categories: table wines, dessert wines,
  sparkling wines, imported beer and distilled spirits. The table below
  sets forth the unit volumes (in thousands of gallons) and net sales (in
  thousands) for all of the table, dessert and sparkling wines, grape juice
  concentrate and other wine related products and services sold by the

  year. The Company also sells over 15 different brands of varietal table

    (a) Excludes sales of wine coolers but includes sales of wine in bulk.
   
  The Company's table wine brands include:
   
      Almaden: The fifth largest selling table wine brand and the ninth
      largest varietal wine brand in the United States. Almaden is one of
      the oldest and best known table wines in the United States.
   
      Inglenook: The sixth largest selling table wine brand and the seventh
      largest varietal wine in the United States with a significant
      restaurant and bar presence.
   
      Paul Masson: The 11th largest selling table wine brand in the United
      States which is offered in all major varietal and non-varietal
      product categories in a full range of sizes.
   
      Taylor California Cellars: The 14th largest domestic selling table
      wine brand in the United States which is also offered in all major
      varietal and non-varietal product categories in a full range of
      sizes.
   
      Cribari: A well known brand of both varietal and non-varietal table
      wines marketed in the popularly priced segment.
   
      Manischewitz: The largest selling brand of kosher wine in the United
      States.
   
<PAGE>

      Taylor New York: One of the United States' oldest brands of non-
      varietal wine marketed primarily in the eastern half of the United
      States.
   
      Richards Wild Irish Rose: A brand of table wine possessing unique
      taste characteristics which is a line extension of the nation's
      leading dessert wine brand.
   
      Deer Valley: This line of California varietal and non-varietal table
      wines introduced in 1989 has had significant success in California.
      The Company is in the process of introducing this brand in other
      regions of the country.
   
      Cook's: This varietal wine was created to take advantage of the brand
      recognition associated with Cook's sparkling wines.
   
      Dunnewood: From California's north coast, unit volumes of this
      varietal wine have also increased significantly. This brand is
      marketed at the lower end of the premium price category.

      The Company has pursued a strategy of increasing its unit volume
  sales in the table wine segment by acquiring new brands and by growing
  existing brands. The Company's unit volume sales of non-varietal table
  wines increased from approximately 9.3 million gallons in fiscal 1992 to
  approximately 52.6 million gallons on a pro forma basis for fiscal 1994
  as a result of the Vintners Acquisition and the Almaden/Inglenook
  Acquisition. Likewise, the Company's unit volume sales of varietal table
  wines increased from approximately 1.1 million gallons in fiscal 1992 to
  over 12.8 million gallons on a pro forma basis for fiscal 1994 as a
  result of the Vintners Acquisition and the Almaden/Inglenook Acquisition.
  The Company believes that its recent acquisition of the Almaden/Inglenook
  Product Lines, including the Almaden and Inglenook brands, creates
  additional opportunities for growth in this product category.
   
      The 1993 decrease in unit volume of Vintners' table wines resulted
  from a number of factors including a significant decrease in Vintners'
  expenditures for advertising, promotion and selling activities during the
  three year period ended July 31, 1993. The Company believes that this
  decrease resulted in a reduction in the level of wholesaler attention
  paid to Vintners' brands, and the Company believes that certain of
  Vintners' products were not competitively priced. During the Company's
  fiscal 1994, unit volume sales of Vintners table wines continued to
  decline. During fiscal 1994, the Company implemented steps to address
  this decline, including a reduction in prices for its Taylor California
  brands, the implementation of new promotional programs and repackaging of
  selected products. As a result of these efforts, the Company believes
  that sales of Vintners' brands have begun to stabilize.  

      The Company also markets a selection of popularly priced imported
  table wines.  These brands include:
   
      Marcus James: One of the largest selling imported varietal wines in
      the United States. Marcus James is a line of varietal table wines
      which includes white zinfandel, chardonnay, cabernet sauvignon and
      merlot. The  Company owns the Marcus James brand and contracts for
      its production in Brazil.
   
<PAGE>

      Partager: A popularly priced French table wine with both varietal and
      non-varietal products. The Company owns the Partager brand and
      contracts for its production in France.
   
      Mateus: The second largest selling Portuguese table wine and a highly
      recognized brand name. This brand is imported by the Company under a
      distribution agreement.
   
      The Company's unit volume sales of imported wine increased steadily
  from 1.3 million gallons in fiscal 1992 to 1.9 million gallons in fiscal
  1994. This increase is attributable primarily to increased sales of the
  Marcus James brand and the inclusion of a full year of Mateus sales.
  Including sales of Partager by Vintners prior to its acquisition by the
  Company, on a pro forma basis for fiscal 1994, the Company sold
  approximately 2.0 million gallons of imported table wines.

      Dessert Wines. The Company markets substantially all of its dessert
  wines in the lower end of the popularly priced segment. The popularly
  priced segment represented approximately 88% of the dessert wine market
  in calendar 1993. Sales of dessert wines comprised 10.2% of the Company's
  total revenues during the fiscal year ended August 31, 1994, on a pro
  forma basis. The table below sets forth the unit volumes (in thousands of
  gallons) for the domestic dessert wines sold by the Company and under
  domestic dessert wine brands acquired in the Vintners Acquisition for the
  1992, 1993 and 1994 fiscal years:

</TABLE>

      The Company's dessert wines include:
   
      Richards Wild Irish Rose: The largest selling dessert wine brand in
      the United States and the Company's leading dessert wine brand in
      unit volume sales.
   
      Cisco: The fourth largest selling dessert wine brand in the United
      States.  Cisco is a flavored dessert wine positioned higher in price
      than Richards Wild Irish Rose.
   
  Taylor New York: Premium dessert wines, including port and sherry.
   
      The Company's unit volume sales of dessert wines have declined over
  the last three years. The decline can be attributed to a general decline
  in dessert wine consumption in the United States.  The Company's unit
  volume sales of its dessert wine brands (including the brands acquired
  from Vintners) have decreased 26.9% from fiscal 1992 to fiscal 1994.
   
      Sparkling Wines. The Company markets substantially all of its
  sparkling wines in the popularly priced segment, which constituted
<PAGE>

  approximately 48% of the domestic sparkling wine market in calendar 1993.
  The table below sets forth the unit volumes (in thousands of gallons) for
  the domestic sparkling wines sold by the Company and under domestic

</TABLE>

      The Company's sparkling wine brands include:
   
      Cook's: The second largest selling domestic sparkling wine in the
      United States. This brand of champagne is marketed in a bell shaped
      bottle and is cork-finished, packaging generally associated with
      higher priced products.
   
      J. Roget: The sixth largest selling domestic sparkling wine in the
      United States, priced slightly below Cook's.
   
      Great Western: A premium priced champagne, fermented in the bottle.
   
      Taylor New York: A well known premium priced champagne also fermented

      Codorniu: The second largest Spanish sparkling wine imported in the
      United States; sold in the premium price category.
   
      Jacques Bonet: Priced in the economy segment, this product appeals to
      restaurants and caterers.
   
      The Company has maintained sales levels of sparkling wine over the
  last three years in contrast to a general industry decline in sales for
  this product category.
   
      Grape Juice Concentrate. As part of its wine business, the Company
  produces grape juice concentrate. Grape juice concentrate is sold to the
  food and wine industries as a raw material for the production of juice-
  based products, no-sugar-added foods and beverages. Grape juice
  concentrate competes with other domestically produced and imported fruit-
  based concentrates. As a result of the Almaden/Inglenook Acquisition, the
  Company believes that it is the leading grape juice concentrate producer
  in the United States. Sales of grape juice concentrate accounted for
  approximately 11% and 12% of the Company's net sales for its fiscal years
  ended 1992 and 1993, respectively.  The table below sets forth the unit
  volumes (in thousands of gallons) for the grape juice concentrate sold by
  the Company and the grape juice concentrate business acquired in the

  other brandies; wine coolers sold primarily under the Sun Country brand
  name; cooking wine; and wine for the production of vinegar. The Company
  also provides various bottling and distillation production services for

      Beer. The Company is the fourth largest marketer of imported beers in
  the United States. The Company distributes Corona, St. Pauli Girl, Modelo
  Especial and Tsingtao, four of the top imported beer brands in the United
  States. The table below sets forth the unit volume (in thousands of
  cases) and net sales (in thousands) for the beer sold by Barton for the
  years ended August 31:

       The Company's principal imported beer brands include:
   
      Corona: The number one selling beer in Mexico and the second largest
      selling imported beer in the United States. In addition, the Company
      believes that Corona is the largest selling import in the territory
      in which it is distributed by the Company. The Company has
      represented the supplier of Corona since 1978 and currently sells
      Corona and its related Mexican beer brands in 25 primarily western
      states.
   
      St. Pauli Girl: The 15th largest selling imported beer in the United
      States, and the second largest selling German import.
   
      Modelo Especial: One of the family of products imported from the
      supplier of Corona, Modelo Especial is the number one selling canned
      beer in Mexico and is growing in the United States with 1994
      shipments into the United States increasing by 57% over 1993
      shipments in the same period.
   
      Tsingtao: The largest selling Chinese beer in the United States.
   
      The Company's other imported beer brands include Pacifico and Negra
  Modelo from Mexico, Peroni from Italy and Double Diamond from the United
<PAGE>

  Kingdom. In September 1992 the Company acquired the Stevens Point
  Brewery, a regional brewer located in Wisconsin, together with its brands
  including Point Special.

      Net sales and unit volumes of the Company's beer brands have grown
  during the previous two fiscal years as a result of the acquisition of
  the St. Pauli Girl and Double Diamond brands on July 1, 1992, the
  acquisition of the Point brands in September 1992 and increased sales of
  Corona and the Company's other Mexican beer brands. The Company's selling
  prices were not increased significantly over this time period.
   
      Distilled Spirits. The Company is the eighth largest producer,
  importer and marketer of distilled spirits in the United States. The
  Company produces, bottles, imports and markets a diversified line of
  quality distilled spirits, and also exports distilled spirits to more
  than 15 foreign countries. The table below sets forth the unit volumes
  (in thousands of 9-liter cases) and net sales (in thousands) for the
  distilled products case goods sold by Barton for the years ended August
  31:

      The Company's leading distilled spirits brands include:
   
      Monte Alban: A premium priced product which the Company believes is
      the number one selling mezcal in the United States.
   
      Montezuma: This brand is the number two selling tequila in the United
  States.
   
      Ten High Bourbon: One of the leading bourbon brands in the United
  States.
   
      Barton Gin and Vodka: Well-known leading national brands.
   
      Other products include Crystal Palace Gin and Vodka, Lauder's, House
  of Stuart and Highland Mist Scotch whiskeys, Kentucky Gentleman, Very Old
  Barton and Tom Moore bourbon whiskeys, Sabroso coffee liqueur, Northern
  Light, Canadian Host and Canadian Supreme Canadian whiskeys and Imperial,
  Barton Reserve and Barton Premium blended whiskeys. Substantially all of
  the Company's unit volume consists of products marketed in the price
  value segment, which the Company believes constituted approximately 50%
  of the distilled spirits market in calendar 1993.
   
      Net sales and unit volumes of the Company's distilled
  spirits brands have decreased 1.6% and 4.3%, respectively,
  over the periods shown, there
  have been changes in sales of particular brands. Unit volumes of vodka
  and tequila have increased while Scotch and bourbon have experienced
<PAGE>

  decreases in unit volume. Net sales have generally not been affected by
  price increases.
   
      In addition to the branded products described above, the Company also
  sells distilled spirits in bulk and provides contract production and
  bottling services. These activities accounted for net sales during the 12
  month periods ended August 31, 1992, 1993 and 1994 of $11.8 million,
  $10.6 million and $7.0 million, respectively.

  Marketing and Distribution

      The Company's products are distributed and sold throughout the United
  States through over 1,000 wholesalers, as well as through state alcoholic
  beverage control agencies. The Company employs a full-time in-house sales
  organization of approximately 350 people to develop and service its sales
  to wholesalers and state agencies. The Company's sales force is organized
  in four sales units: a beer unit, a spirits unit and two wine units, one
  of which focuses on the newly acquired brands purchased in the
  Almaden/Inglenook Acquisition. The Company believes that the organization
  of its sales force into four divisions positions it to maintain a high
  degree of focus on each of its principal product categories.
   
       The Company's marketing strategy places primary emphasis upon
  promotional programs directed at its broad national distribution network
  (and to the retailers served by that network). The Company closely
  manages its advertising expenditures in relation to the performance of
  its brands. The Company has extensive marketing programs for its brands
  including television, radio, outdoor and print advertising, promotional
  programs on both a national basis and regional basis in accordance with
  the strength of the brands, event sponsorship, market research, point-of-
  sale materials, trade advertising and public relations.

  Trademarks and Distribution Agreements

      The Company's wine products are sold under a number of trademarks.
  All of these trademarks are either owned by the Company or used by the
  Company under exclusive license or distribution agreements.
   
      The Company also owns the following trademarks used in its distilled
  spirits business: Montezuma, House of Stuart, Highland Mist, Kentucky
  Gentleman, Barton, Canadian Supreme and Sabroso. The Monte Alban
  trademark for use outside of Mexico is jointly owned by the Company and
  the supplier of Monte Alban Mezcal. The Company owns the world-wide sales
  and marketing rights outside of Mexico.  

      In September 1989, Barton purchased certain assets from Hiram Walker
  & Sons, Inc. ("Hiram Walker") and obtained licenses to use the trade
  names Ten High, Crystal Palace, Northern Light, Lauder's, and Imperial
  for an initial seven year period. Under an agreement dated January 28,
  1994, the Company paid $5.1 million to Hiram Walker for the extension of
  licenses to use these brand names and certain other spirits brands, for
  varying periods, the longest of which terminates in 2116.
   
      All of the Company's imported beer products are marketed and sold
  pursuant to exclusive distribution agreements from the suppliers of these
  products. These agreements have terms that vary and prohibit the Company
  from importing other beers from the same country. The Company's agreement
<PAGE>

  to distribute Corona and its other Mexican beer brands exclusively
  throughout 25 states was renewed effective January 1994 and expires in
  December 1998 with automatic renewal thereafter for one year periods from
  year to year unless terminated. Under this agreement, the Mexican
  supplier has the right to consent to Mr. Goodman's successor as Chairman
  and Chief Executive Officer of Barton's beer subsidiary, which consent
  may not be unreasonably withheld, and, if such consent is properly
  withheld, to terminate the agreement. The Company's agreement for the
  importation of St. Pauli Girl expires in 1998 with automatic renewal
  until 2003 unless the Company terminates the Agreement. The Company's
  agreement for
  the exclusive importation of Tsingtao throughout the entire United States
  was renewed effective January 1994 and expires in December 1996 with an
  automatic renewal to December 1999.  Prior to their expiration, these
  agreements may be terminated if the Company fails to meet certain
  performance criteria. The Company believes it is currently in compliance
  with all of its material distribution agreements. Given the Company's
  long-term relationships with its suppliers, the Company does not believe
  that these agreements will be terminated and expects that such agreements
  will be renewed prior to their expiration.

  COMPETITION
   
      The beverage alcohol industry is highly competitive. The Company
  competes on the basis of quality, price, brand recognition and
  distribution. The Company's beverage alcohol products compete with other
  alcoholic and non-alcoholic beverages for consumer purchases, as well as
  shelf space in retail stores and for marketing focus by the Company's
  wholesalers. The Company competes with numerous multinational producers
  and distributors of beverage alcohol products, many of which have
  significantly greater resources than the Company. The Company's principal
  competitors include E&J Gallo Winery in the wine category, Van Munching &
  Co., Molson Breweries USA and Guinness in the imported beer category and
  United Distillers Glenmore and Jim Beam Brands in the distilled spirits
  category.

  PRODUCTION
   
      The Company's wines are produced from several varieties of wine
  grapes grown principally in California and New York. The grapes are
  crushed at the Company's wineries and stored as wine, grape juice or
  concentrate. Such grape products may be made into wine for sale under the
  Company's brand names, sold to other companies for resale under their own
  labels, or shipped to customers in the form of juice, juice concentrate,
  unfinished wines, high-proof grape spirits or brandy. Most of the
  Company's wines are bottled and sold within 18 months after the grape
  crush. The Company's inventories of wines, grape juice and concentrate
  are usually at their highest levels in November and December, immediately
  after the crush of each year's grape harvest, and are substantially
  reduced prior to the subsequent year's crush.
   
      The bourbon whiskeys, domestic blended whiskeys and light whiskeys
  marketed by the Company are primarily produced and aged by the Company at
  its distillery in Bardstown, Kentucky, though it may from time to time
  supplement its inventories through purchases from other distillers. At
  its Atlanta, Georgia facility, the Company produces all of the grain
  neutral spirits used by it in the production of vodka, gin and blended
  whiskey sold by it to customers in the state of Georgia. The Company's
<PAGE>

  requirements of Canadian and Scotch whiskeys, and tequila, mezcal, and
  the grain neutral spirits used by it in the production of gin and vodka
  for sale outside of Georgia, and other spirits products, are purchased
  from various suppliers.

  Sources and Availability of Raw Materials

      The principal components in the production of the Company's branded
  beverage alcohol products are: packaging materials, primarily glass;
  grapes; and other agricultural products, such as grain.

       The Company utilizes glass bottles and other materials, such as
  caps, corks, capsules, labels and cardboard cartons in the bottling and
  packaging of its products. Glass bottle costs is one of the largest
  components of the Company's cost of product sold. The glass bottle
  industry is highly concentrated with only a small number of producers.
  The Company has traditionally obtained, and continues to obtain, its
  glass requirements from a limited number of producers. The Company has
  not experienced difficulty in satisfying its requirements with respect to
  any of the foregoing and considers its sources of supply to be adequate.
  However, the inability of any of the Company's glass bottle suppliers to
  satisfy the Company's requirements could adversely affect the Company's
  operations. 
   
      Most of the Company's annual grape requirements are satisfied by
  purchases from each year's harvest, which occurs from July through
  October. The Company owns no vineyards in California and purchases grapes
  from over 1,000 independent growers principally in California and New
  York. In connection with the Vintners Acquisition and the
  Almaden/Inglenook Acquisition, the Company acquired certain long term
  grape purchase contracts. The Company enters into written purchase
  agreements with a majority of these growers on a year-to-year basis. As a
  result of this ample grape supply the Company believes that its exposure
  to phylloxera and other agricultural risks is minimal.
   
      The distilled spirits manufactured by the Company require various
  agricultural products, neutral grain spirits and bulk spirits. The
  Company fulfills its requirements through purchases from various sources,
  through contractual arrangements and through purchases on the open
  market. The Company believes that adequate supplies of the aforementioned
  products are available at the present time.
   
  GOVERNMENT REGULATION

      The Company's operations are subject to extensive federal and state
  regulation. These regulations cover, among other matters, sales
  promotion, advertising and public relations, labeling and packaging,
  changes in officers or directors, ownership or control, distribution
  methods and relationships, and requirements regarding brand registration
  and the posting of prices and price changes. All of the Company's
  facilities are also subject to federal, state and local environmental
  laws and regulations and the Company is required to obtain permits and
  licenses to operate its facilities. The Company believes that it is in
  compliance in all material respects with all presently applicable
  governmental laws and regulations and that the cost of administration of
  compliance with such laws and regulations does not have, and is not
<PAGE>

  expected to have, a material adverse impact on the Company's financial
  condition or results of operations. 

  EMPLOYEES

       The Company has approximately 2,650 full-time employees,
  approximately 900 of whom are covered by collective bargaining
  agreements. The Company's collective bargaining agreement covering 368
  employees at the Mission Bell winery has expired and negotiations have
  commenced. Additional workers may be employed by the Company during the
  grape crushing season. The Company considers its employee relations to be
  good.

  Item 2. PROPERTIES

      The Company currently operates 15 wineries, two bottling and
  distilling plants, one bottling and rectifying plant and a brewery, all
  of which include warehousing and distribution facilities on the premises.
  The Company considers its principal facilities to be the Mission Bell
  winery in Madera, California, the Canandaigua, New York winery, and the
  Gonzales, California winery and the distilling and bottling facility
  located in Bardstown, Kentucky. Under the Restructuring Plan, the Central
  Cellars winery located in Lodi, California and the Soledad, California
  winery will be closed and offered for sale to reduce excess capacity.
   
       In New York, the Company operates four wineries located in
  Canandaigua, Naples, Batavia and Hammondsport. The Hammondsport winery
  lease, acquired in the Vintners Acquisition, expires in April 1995.
  Production at this winery will be consolidated at the Company's other New
  York wineries.
   
       The Company currently operates 11 winery facilities in California,
  including Central Cellars and Soledad Cellars which are to be closed. In
  the Almaden/Inglenook Acquisition, the Company acquired two new
  facilities located in Escalon and Madera, California. The Madera winery
  (known as the Mission Bell winery) is a crushing, wine production,
  bottling and distribution facility and a grape juice concentrate
  production facility. The Mission Bell winery will absorb the production
  of Central Cellars. The Escalon facility is operated under a long-term
  lease with an option to buy. As part of the Restructuring Plan, the
  branded wine bottling operations at the Gonzales, California facility
  where Paul Masson and Taylor Cellars are currently bottled will be moved
  to the Mission Bell winery during fiscal 1995. The other wineries
  operated in California are located in Lodi, McFarland, Madera, Fresno and
  Ukiah.
   
      The Company operates three facilities that produce and/or bottle and
  store distilled spirits. It owns production, bottling and storage
  facilities in Bardstown, Kentucky and Atlanta, Georgia, and operates a
  bottling plant in Carson, California, near Los Angeles, under a
  management contract. The Bardstown facility distills, bottles and
  warehouses whiskey for the Company's account and on a contractual basis
  for other participants in the industry. The Company also owns a
  production plant in Atlanta, Georgia which produces vodka, gin and
  blended whiskeys. The Carson plant receives distilled spirits in bulk
  from Bardstown and outside vendors, which it bottles and distributes. The
  Company also performs contract bottling at the Carson plant.
<PAGE>

   
      The Company owns a brewery in Stevens Point, Wisconsin where it
  produces and bottles Point beer. In addition, the Company owns and
  maintains its corporate headquarters in Canandaigua, New York, and leases
  office space in Chicago, Illinois, for its Barton headquarters.
   
      The Company believes that all of its facilities are in good condition
  and working order and have adequate capacity to meet its needs for the
  foreseeable future.
   
       Most of the Company's real property has been pledged under the terms
  of collateral security mortgages as security for the payment of
  outstanding loans under the Credit Facility.



  Item 3. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS
   
      The Company and its subsidiaries are subject to litigation from time
  to time in the ordinary course of business. Although the amount of any
  liability with respect to such litigation cannot be determined, in the
  opinion of management, such liability will not have a material adverse
  effect on the Company's financial condition or results of operations.
   
       In connection with an investigation in the State of New Jersey into
  regulatory trade practices in the beverage alcohol industry, one employee
  of the Company was arrested in March 1994 and another employee has
  subsequently come under investigation in connection with providing "free
  goods" to retailers in violation of New Jersey beverage alcohol laws.
  Employees of several wholesalers and other alcoholic beverage
  manufacturers were also arrested or are under active investigation.
  Although the New Jersey Attorney General's office may expand its criminal
  investigation to include the Company and other manufacturers, to date, no
  grand jury subpoenas have been issued and no charges have been brought.
  The Company has cooperated with the Attorney General's office and, as a
  result of extensive discussions, the Attorney General's office has
  requested and the Company has submitted a detailed proposal to achieve a
  resolution of all civil, criminal and regulatory issues. The Company does
  not believe that the dollar amount of such a settlement or its effect on
  the Company's operations, if any, will be material.
   
       The United States Environmental Protection Agency (the "EPA") and
  the Georgia Environmental Protection Division (the "GEPD") conducted
  a Compliance Evaluation Inspection ("CEI") of Barton Brands of Georgia,
  Inc. ("Barton Georgia"), a subsidiary of Canandaigua Wine Company, Inc.,
  on February 15, 1994.  The CEI was conducted to determine compliance with
  the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act ("RCRA").  Following the
  inspection, the EPA sent a report of its findings together with a
  transmittal letter, dated March 7, 1994, to Barton Georgia.  

      By letter dated March 21, 1994, the GEPD implemented enforcement
  action by serving Barton Georgia with a formal Notice of Violation
  alleging that between August 1991 and August 1993, Barton Georgia has
  violated certain regulations pertaining to (i) generation and
  accumulation of hazardous waste and (ii) hazardous waste burning in
  boilers.  These alleged violations relate to the burning of fusel oil
  which is a mixture of alcohols created by the distillation process used
<PAGE>

  in manufacturing various types of liquor products.  Accompanying the
  Notice of Violation was a proposed settlement agreement in the form of a
  Consent Order between the GEPD and Barton Georgia.  Following
  counterproposals, on October 21,
  1994, Barton Georgia entered into a settlement agreement under the terms
  of a final Consent Order (the "Order") with the GEPD with respect to this
  matter.  Under the Order, Barton Georgia has paid a stipulated civil
  penalty of $99,000, and will incur approximately $16,000 of other costs.
  Barton
  Georgia is not burning fusel oil in its current operations.  The signing
  of the settlement agreement by Barton Georgia does not constitute any finding,
  determination or adjudication of liabiity on the part of Barton Georgia,
  nor any finding, determination or adjudication of a violation of any State
  or Federal laws, rules, standards or requirements; nor did Barton Georgia
  make any admission with respect thereto by signing the settlement agreement.

  Item 7.   Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and
            Results of Operations. 

  Results of Operations of the Company

    The Company has realized significant growth in sales and profitability
  over the last three years primarily as a result of acquisitions.  The
  Company acquired Guild on October 1, 1991, Barton on June 29, 1993,
  Vintners on October 15, 1993 and the Almaden /Inglenook Product Lines on
  August 5, 1994.  Management expects the Acquisitions to have a
  substantial impact on the future results of the Company's operations. 
  The Company's results of operations for the 1992 fiscal year include only
  11 months of operations of the assets acquired from Guild as compared to
  the 1993 fiscal year, which include such results for the complete period. 
  The Company's results of operations for the 1993 fiscal year include the
  results of operations of Barton from June 29, 1993, the date of the
  Barton Acquisition, until the end of the period.  The Company's results
  of operations for the 1994 fiscal year include the results of operations
  of Vintners from October 15, 1993, the date of the Vintners Acquisition,
  until the end of the period, and the results of operations of the
  Almaden/Inglenook Product Lines from August 5, 1994, the date of the
  Almaden/Inglenook Acquisition, until the end of the period.

    The following table sets forth, for the periods indicated, certain
  items in the Company's consolidated statements of income expressed as a
  percentage of net sales:

  Fiscal Year Ended August 31, 1994 Compared to Fiscal Year Ended August

  Net Sales

    Net sales for the Company's 1994 fiscal year increased to $629.6
  million from $306.3 million for the fiscal year ended August 31, 1993, an
  increase of $323.3 million, or approximately 106%.  The increase resulted
  from the inclusion of (i) an additional 10 months of Barton's net sales
  during the fiscal year ended August 31, 1994, amounting to $210.6 million,
  as compared to two months of Barton's net sales in the same period a year
<PAGE>

  ago, (ii) $119.2 million of net sales of Vintners' products from October
  15, 1993, the date of the Vintners Acquisition and (iii) $17.1 million of
  net sales of products acquired in the Almaden/Inglenook Acquisition from
  August 5, 1994, the date of the Almaden/Inglenook Acquisition.  Excluding
  the impact of the Acquisitions, the Company's net sales decreased $23.5
  million, or 9.2%, when compared to the same period a year ago.  This was
  principally due to a decrease in net sales of the Company's non-branded
  products, specifically grape juice concentrate, and to lower sales of the
  Company's dessert wines.

    For purposes of computing the comparative data below, sales of branded
  wine products acquired in the Vintners and Almaden/Inglenook Acquisitions
  have been included in the fiscal year ended August 31, 1994 from the
  acquisition dates through August 31, 1994, and included for the same
  periods during the fiscal year ended August 31, 1993 prior to both
  Acquisitions.  Further, sales of branded products acquired in the Barton
  Acquisition have been included for the entire fiscal year ended August
  31, 1994, and included for the same period during the fiscal year ended
  August 31, 1993, ten months of which were prior to the Barton
  Acquisition.

  products for the fiscal year ended August 31, 1994 have increased 0.7%
  and 1.1%, respectively, as compared to the same period a year ago.  This
  increase was principally due to increased net sales and unit volume of
  the Company's imported beer brands and, to a lesser extent, increased net
  sales and unit volume of the Company's varietal table wine brands.

    Net sales and unit volume of the Company's branded wine products for
  the fiscal year ended August 31, 1994 declined 4.6% and 6.0%,
  respectively, as compared to the same period a year ago.  These decreases
  were due to lower sales of branded wine products acquired from Vintners
  and, to a lesser extent, to lower sales of the Company's branded wine
  products, exclusive of branded wine products acquired from Vintners.

    Net sales and unit volume of the Company's varietal table wine brands
  for the fiscal year ended August 31, 1994 increased 2.3% and 6.4%,
  respectively, reflecting increases in substantially all of the Company's
  varietal table wine brands except for varietal table wine brands acquired
  from Vintners which declined 13.2% and 3.1%, in net sales and unit
  volume, respectively.  Net sales and unit volume of the Company's non-
  varietal table wine brands for the same period were down 4.8% and 5.8%,
  respectively, principally due to lower sales of non-varietal table wine
  brands acquired from Vintners.  Net sales and unit volume of sparkling
  wine brands each decreased 2.1% in the fiscal year ended August 31, 1994
  versus the same period a year ago.  This was principally due to a general
  decline in most of the Company's sparkling wine brands with the exception
  of J. Roget.  Net sales and unit volume of the Company's dessert wine
  brands were down 11.1% and 13.2%, respectively, in the fiscal year ended
  August 31, 1994 versus the same period a year ago.  The Company's net
  sales and unit volume of dessert wine brands have declined over the last
  three years.  These declines can be attributed to a general decline in
  dessert wine consumption in the United States.  For the fiscal year ended
  August 31, 1994, net sales of branded dessert wines constituted less than
  12% of the Company's overall net sales.  Notwithstanding this, net sales
  and unit volume of the premium dessert wine brands acquired from Vintners
<PAGE>

  increased and remained flat, respectively, in the fiscal year ended
  August 31, 1994 versus the same period a year ago.

    Net sales and unit volume of the Company's beer brands for the fiscal
  year ended August 31, 1994 increased by 12.9% and 13.3%, respectively,
  when compared to net sales and unit volume of these 
  beer brands with respect to
  the same period a year ago, part of which was prior to the Barton
  Acquisition.  These increases resulted primarily from increased sales of
  the Company's Corona brand and other Mexican beer brands, and increased
  sales of its St. Pauli Girl and Point brands.  The Company's new
  agreement to continue to distribute Corona and its other Mexican beer
  brands expires in December 1998.

  Net sales and unit volume of the Company's spirits case goods for the
  fiscal year ended August 31, 1994 were down 1.5% and up 0.4%,
  respectively, as compared to net sales and unit volume of these 
  spirits case
  goods with respect to the same period a year ago, part of which was prior
  to the Barton Acquisition.  This decrease in net
  sales was primarily due to lower net sales of the Company's aged whiskeys
  (i.e., Canadian, bourbon and Scotch whiskeys), which was partially offset
  by increased net sales of the Company's blended whiskey, tequila and
  liqueur brands.

  Gross Profit

    Gross profit increased to $182.4 million in the fiscal year ended
  August 31, 1994 from $91.4 million in the fiscal year ended August 31,
  1993, an increase of $91.0 million, or approximately 100%.  This increase
  in gross profit resulted from the inclusion of the operations of Barton,
  Vintners and the Almaden/Inglenook Product Lines with those of the
  Company.  Gross profit as a percentage of net sales decreased to 29.0% in
  the fiscal year ended August 31, 1994 from 29.8% in the fiscal year ended
  August 31, 1993.  The Company's gross margin decreased primarily as a
  result of the inclusion of Barton's and Vintners' operations into the
  Company.

  Selling, General and Administrative Expenses

    Selling, general and administrative expenses increased to $121.4
  million in the fiscal year ended August 31, 1994 from $60.0 million in
  the fiscal year ended August 31, 1993, an increase of $61.4 million, or
  approximately 102%.  This increase resulted from the additional selling,
  general and administrative expenses associated with the operations of
  Barton and Vintners and higher advertising and promotional spending on
  brands the Company owned prior to the Barton and Vintners Acquisitions.

  Nonrecurring Restructuring Expenses

    The Company previously announced a plan to restructure the
  operations of its California wineries.  The Restructuring Plan will
  enable the Company to realize significant cost savings from the
  consolidation of existing facilities and the facilities acquired in the
  Almaden/Inglenook Acquisition.  Under the Restructuring Plan, all
  bottling operations at the Central Cellars Winery in Lodi, California and
  the branded wine bottling operations at the Monterey Cellars Winery in
  Gonzales, California will be moved to the Mission Bell Winery located in
  Madera, California which was acquired by the Company in the
  Almaden/Inglenook Acquisition.  The Monterey Cellars Winery will continue
<PAGE>
  to be used as a crushing, winemaking and contract bottling facility.  The
  Central Cellars Winery and the winery in Soledad, California will be
  closed and offered for sale to reduce surplus capacity.  The Company
  anticipates that implementation of the Restructuring Plan will result in
  approximately 260 jobs being eliminated.  As a result of the
  Restructuring Plan, the Company has taken a restructuring charge in the
  fourth quarter of fiscal 1994 which will reduce after-tax income for
  fiscal 1994 by $14.9 million, or $0.91 per share on a fully diluted
  basis.  During fiscal 1995, implementation of the Restructuring Plan will
  require net cash expenditures of approximately $27.1 million, including
  $20.0 million for capital expenditures to expand storage capacity and
  install certain relocated equipment.  The Company expects to have the
  Restructuring Plan fully implemented by the end of fiscal 1995.  The
  Company anticipates that the Restructuring Plan will result in net cost
  savings of approximately $1.7 million in fiscal 1995 and approximately
  $13.3 million of annual net cost savings beginning in fiscal 1996.  See
  "Financial Liquidity and Capital Resources."

  Interest Expense, Net

    Interest expense, net increased to $18.1 million in the fiscal year
  ended August 31, 1994 from $6.1 million in the fiscal year ended August
  31, 1993, an increase of $12.0 million.  The increase resulted primarily
  from borrowings related to the Acquisitions.

  Net Income

    Net income decreased to $11.7 million in the fiscal year ended August
  31, 1994 from $15.6 million in the fiscal year ended August 31, 1993, a
  decrease of $3.9 million, or approximately 24.8%.  The decrease in net
  income resulted primarily from the restructuring charge of $24 million
  which reduced after tax net income by $14.9 million.  Exclusive of the
  impact of the restructuring charge, net income increased 71% to $26.6
  million, or $1.65 of fully diluted earnings per common share, compared
  with net income of $15.6 million or $1.20 of fully diluted earnings per
  common share in fiscal 1993.  See "Nonrecurring Restructuring Expenses"
  and "Financial
  Liquidity and Capital Resources".

  Fiscal Year Ended August 31, 1993 Compared to Fiscal Year Ended August
  31, 1992

  Net Sales

    Net sales for the Company's 1993 fiscal year increased to $306.3
  million from $245.2 million for the year ended August 31, 1992, an
  increase of $61.1 million, or 24.9%.  This increase resulted from the
  inclusion of $52.0 million of Barton's net sales since the date of the
  Barton Acquisition and increased net sales of grape juice concentrate,
  brands acquired from Guild and private label and other specialty
  products.  These increases, however, were partially offset by a decrease
  in net sales of the Company's branded wine products.

    Net sales and unit volume of the Company's branded wine products,
  including sales of products under brands acquired from Guild for
  comparable 11-month periods declined 5.1% and 10.1%, respectively, as
  compared to the same period a year ago.  These decreases were principally
  due to a decline in net sales and unit volume of the Company's dessert
<PAGE>

  wine brands.  The change in net sales of the Company's branded wine
  products declined less than unit volume due to higher prices of certain
  brands and a favorable change in product mix.

    For the 1993 fiscal year, including sales of products acquired from
  Guild for comparable 11-month periods, unit volume of the Company's
  varietal table wine brands increased by approximately 24%, reflecting
  significant increases in sales of substantially all of the Company's
  varietal table wine brands, including Marcus James varietals imported
  from Brazil.  Unit volume of the Company's non-varietal table wines was
  up slightly and unit volumes of sparkling wine brands decreased by
  approximately 2%, as compared to the same period a year ago.  Unit volume
  of the Company's dessert wine brands, including the Richards Wild Irish
  Rose brand, was down approximately 19% during this period.

    The Company believes its lower dessert wine sales may be attributable
  to several factors including the impact of previous price increases made
  in response to a significant federal excise tax increase which took
  effect in January 1991.  In addition, the Company initiated product
  promotions during the fourth quarter of the Company's 1992 fiscal year
  which resulted in higher wholesale inventories at its 1992 fiscal year
  end, thereby reducing dessert wine sales in the first quarter of fiscal
  1993.  Unit volume of the Company's dessert wines have been declining
  since the Company's 1990 fiscal year.

    Unit volume of the Company's beer products for the period July 1, 1993
  to August 31, 1993 increased by approximately 16% when compared to
  Barton's unit volume for the same period a year ago.  This increase
  resulted primarily from increased sales of Corona and the Company's other
  Mexican beer brands and from increased sales of St. Pauli Girl.  Barton
  began to distribute St. Pauli Girl on July 1, 1992 and net sales of St.
  Pauli Girl through August 31, 1992 were adversely affected by high levels
  of wholesaler inventories existing at the time Barton acquired the rights
  to distribute this brand.  For the same two month period, unit volume of
  the Company's spirits case goods increased slightly as compared to
  Barton's unit volume for the same period a year ago.  

  Gross Profit

    Gross profit increased to $91.4 million for the fiscal year ended
  August 31, 1993 from $70.6 million for the fiscal year ended August 31,
  1992, an increase of $20.8 million, or 29.5%.  The increase in gross
  profit resulted from the inclusion of Barton's operations into the
  Company's and increased sales of grape juice concentrate.  Gross profit
  as a percentage of net sales increased to 29.8% for the fiscal year ended
  August 31, 1993 from 28.8% for the prior year.  Gross margins improved
  primarily as a result of higher gross profit margins on net sales of
  grape juice concentrate and Cook's sparkling wines.

  Selling, General and Administrative Expenses

    Selling, general and administrative expenses increased to $60.0
  million during the fiscal year ended August 31, 1993 from $46.5 million
  in fiscal 1992, an increase of $13.5 million, or 29.0%.  This increase
  resulted from the inclusion of the expenses of Barton's operations into
  the Company's and higher promotional and advertising spending with
  respect to brands acquired from Guild.
<PAGE>

  Interest Expense, Net

    Interest expense, net decreased to $6.1 million for the fiscal year
  ended August 31, 1993 from $6.2 million for fiscal 1992 due to lower
  average outstanding debt balances and lower interest rates which were
  somewhat offset by increased interest expense from borrowings incurred to
  acquire Barton.

  Net Income

    Net income increased to $15.6 million for the fiscal year ended
  August 31, 1993 from $11.4 million for the fiscal year ended August 31,
  1992, an increase of $4.2 million, or 37.4%.  Net income as a percentage
  of net sales increased to 5.1% in fiscal 1993 from 4.6% in fiscal 1992.

  Financial Liquidity and Capital Resources

  General

    The Company's principal use of cash in its operating activities is for
  purchasing and carrying inventory of raw materials and finished goods. 
  The Company's primary source of liquidity has historically 
  been cash flow from
  operations, except during the annual fall grape harvests when the Company
  has relied on short-term borrowings.  The annual grape crush  normally
  begins in August and runs through November.  The Company generally begins
  purchasing grapes in August with payments for such grapes beginning to
  come due in September.  The Company's short-term borrowings to support
  such purchases generally reach their highest levels in November or
  December.  Historically, the Company has used cash flow from operations
  to repay its short-term borrowings.

  Fiscal Year 1994 Cash Flows

  Operating Activities

    Cash flow from operating activities as of August 31, 1994 increased to
  $23.2 million from $8.9 million as of August 31, 1993 principally due to
  increased net income adjusted for non-cash items.  Current assets
  increased by $15.5 million principally due to increased accounts
  receivable levels, resulting from sales of the Vintners and Almaden/Inglenook
  product lines acquired since the dates of the respective acquisitions.  
  Current liabilities, net of
  current liabilities assumed in the Vintners and Almaden/Inglenook
  Acquisitions, increased due to higher accounts payable and accrued
  federal and state excise taxes associated with increased inventories and
  sales, respectively.

  Investing and Financing Activities

    Capital expenditures for the Company for the fiscal year ended August
  31, 1994 were $7.9 million, net of the property, plant and equipment
  acquired in the Vintners and Almaden/Inglenook Acquisitions.  Other
  assets, net of the effect of the Vintners and Almaden/Inglenook
  Acquisitions, increased due to fees associated with the Company's public
  sale of its $130 million 8.75% Senior Subordinated Notes due 2003 (the
  "Notes") and the payment to Hiram Walker & Sons, Inc. for the extension
  of licenses to use the Ten High, Crystal Palace and certain other spirits
  brands.  A summary of the assets and liabilities acquired and the
  additional borrowings incurred in the Acquisitions is shown in the
<PAGE>

  Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows set forth in the financial
  statements included in this Report.

    As of August 31, 1994, under its Credit Facility (as defined below)
  the Company had outstanding Term Loans of $177.0 million, $19.0 million
  of Revolving Loans, and $2.2 million of Revolving Letters of Credit.  As
  of August 31, 1994, under the Credit Facility $47.0 million of Term Loans
  and $163.8 million of Revolving Loans were available to be drawn by the
  Company. 

    Subsequent to August 31, 1994, the Company borrowed Term Loans of
  $47.0 million to finance the increase in current assets associated with
  the Almaden/Inglenook Acquisition and capital expenditures related to the
  Restructuring Plan.  As of October 31, 1994, the Company had outstanding
  Term Loans of $224.0 million, $35.0 million of Revolving Loans, and $2.0
  million outstanding under Revolving Letters of Credit.  As of October 31,
  1994, $148.0 million of Revolving Loans was available to be drawn by the
  Company.

  Redemption and Convertible Debentures.  

    On October 18, 1993, the Company called its 7% Convertible
  Subordinated Debentures Due 2011 (the "Convertible Debentures") for
  redemption on November 19, 1993 at a redemption price 102.1% plus accrued
  interest.  Prior to such redemption substantially all of the Convertible
  Debentures were converted into shares of the Company's Class A Common
  Stock.

  Stock Offering

    On November 18, 1994, the Company completed its public sale of
  3,937,744 shares of its Class A Common Stock at a price to the public of
  $33.50 per share in simultaneous United States and international
  offerings (the "Offerings").  Of the total number of shares sold in the
  Offerings, 3 million shares were sold by the Company (the "Shares") and
  937,744 shares were sold by certain selling stockholders.  The Company
  used the net proceeds from the sale of the Shares, $96.3 million,
  together with the proceeds it received from certain of the selling
  stockholders in connection with their exercise of certain options issued
  to them in connection with the Vintners Acquisition, $7.8 million, to
  repay indebtedness under the Credit Facility.  On November 21, 1994, Term
  Loans in the amount of $82 million and Revolving Loans in the amount of
  $22.1 million were prepaid with the proceeds from the Offerings.  As a
  result of this prepayment, the Term Loan commitment in the Credit
  Facility has been reduced to $142.0 million from $224.0 million.

    Following the prepayment of these loans, the Company had outstanding
  Term Loans of $142.0 million, $16 million of Revolving Loans, and $2.2
  million outstanding under Revolving Letters of Credit.  As of November
  21, 1994, $166.8 million of Revolving Loans was available to be drawn by
  the Company.

  The Company's Credit Facility

    The Company and a syndicate of 20 banks for which The Chase Manhattan
  Bank, N.A. acts as agent, entered into a Second Amendment and Restatement
  (as amended) dated as of August 5, 1994 of Amendment and Restatement of
<PAGE>

  Credit Agreement dated June 29, 1993 (the "Credit Facility").  The
  Company's Credit Facility presently provides for (i) a $142 million term
  loan facility due in June, 2000, (ii) a $185 million revolving credit
  facility, which expires in June 2000 and (iii) an existing $28.2 million
  letter of credit related to the Barton Acquisition (the "Barton Letter of
  Credit").  All payments of Term Loans by the Company reduce the
  commitment amount.  The Term Loans borrowed under the Credit Facility may
  be either base rate loans or eurodollar base rate loans.  Base rate loans
  have an interest rate equal to the higher of either the Federal Funds
  rate plus 0.5% or the prime rate.  Eurodollar rate loans currently have
  an interest rate equal to LIBOR plus 1.25%.  The current interest rate
  for both base rate and eurodollar rate loans may be increased by up to
  0.25% and eurodollar rate loans may be decreased by up to 0.375%,
  depending on the Company's debt ratio and long-term debt ratings.  The
  principal of the Term Loans is to be repaid in 20 quarterly installments
  of $7 million each beginning December 15, 1994, with a final quarterly
  payment of $2 million due December 15, 1999.  The Company may prepay the
  principal of the Term Loans and the Revolving Loans at its discretion and
  must prepay the principal with, among other sources of funds, 65% of its
  annual excess cash flow, proceeds from the sale of certain assets and the
  first $60 million of the net proceeds from any issuance of equity plus
  50% of any net proceeds in excess of $60 million.

    The $185 million revolving credit available under the Credit Facility
  may be utilized by the Company either in the form of Revolving Loans or
  as Revolving Letters of Credit up to a maximum of $12 million. 
  Additionally, availability of Revolving Loans is subject to a formula
  based on the amount of certain eligible receivables and certain eligible
  inventory and is reduced by the principal amount of Revolving Letters of
  Credit.  As with Term Loans, Revolving Loans may be either base rate
  loans or eurodollar rate loans.  Revolving Loans will mature and must be
  repaid June 15, 2000.  For 30 consecutive days at any time during the
  last two quarters of each fiscal year, the aggregate outstanding
  principal amount of Revolving Loans combined with the Revolving Letters
  of Credit cannot exceed $50 million.

    The Barton Letter of Credit is an existing letter of credit issued in
  the face amount of $28.2 million.  This amount represents the full amount
  committed under the Credit Facility.  On January 1, 1995, the face amount
  of the Barton Letter of Credit will be reduced to $25 million and on
  January 1, 1996, will be reduced to $15 million.  The Barton Letter of
  Credit will terminate on December 31, 1996.  The Company must pay
  commitment and other fees based on the undrawn face amount of the Barton
  Letter of Credit.  In the event a beneficiary makes a demand for payment
  under the Barton Letter of Credit, the Company must pay to the issuing
  bank the amount of such demand at or prior to the date the payment is to
  be made by the issuing bank to the beneficiary, and the Company must
  inform the bank if the Company is borrowing to make that payment.

  The banks under the Credit Facility have been given security interests in
  substantially all of the
  assets of the Company including mortgage liens on certain real property. 
  The Credit Facility requires the Company to meet certain covenants and
  provides for restrictions on mergers, consolidations and sales of assets,
  payment of dividends, incurring of other debt, liens or guarantees and
  the making of investments.  The primary financial covenants as defined in
  the Credit Facility require the maintenance of minimum defined tangible
  net worth, a debt to cash flow coverage ratio, a fixed charges ratio,
  maximum capital expenditures, an interest coverage ratio and a current
  ratio.  Among the most restrictive covenants contained in the Credit
  Facility, the Company is required to maintain a fixed charges ratio not
  less than 1.0 to 1.0 at the last day of each fiscal quarter of each
  fiscal year.  The Revolving Credit Loans require commitment fees totaling
  .375% per annum on the daily average unused balance.  Commitment fees
  totaled approximately $223,000, $228,000 and $154,000 in fiscal 1994,
  1993 and 1992, respectively. 
<PAGE>

    The Credit Facility restricts capital expenditures of the Company to
  $40 million and $17 million for fiscal 1995 and 1996, respectively, and
  $15.5 million for any fiscal year thereafter, plus in each case the
  amount of certain proceeds received from the sale of tangible assets. 
  The Company believes that the $40.0 million of capital expenditures
  allowed to be made under the Credit Facility in fiscal 1995 will be 
  adequate to complete the Restructuring Plan and to maintain
  existing facilities. 

    In connection with the Vintners Acquisition, the Company borrowed $130
  million under a subordinated bank loan.  The Company repaid the
  subordinated bank loan in December, 1993 from the proceeds of Notes
  together with Revolving Loan borrowings.  The Notes are due in 2003 with
  a stated interest rate of 8.75% per annum.  Interest is payable semi-
  annually on June 15 and December 15 of each year.  The Notes are
  redeemable at the option of the Company, in whole or in part, on or after
  December 15, 1998.  The Notes are unsecured and subordinated to the prior
  payment in full of all senior indebtedness of the Company, which includes
  the Credit Facility.  The Notes are guaranteed, on a senior subordinated
  basis, by substantially all of the Company's operating subsidiaries.

    Pursuant to the Barton Acquisition, the Company is obligated to make
  payments of up to an aggregate amount of $57.3 million which payments
  shall be payable over a three year period ending November 29, 1996 (the
  "Earn-Out").  The first payment of $4 million was made on December 31,
  1993.  The second payment of $28.3 million is required to be made to the
  Barton stockholders (the "Barton Stockholders") on December 30, 1994, as
  a result of satisfaction of certain performance goals and the achievement
  of targets for earnings before interest and taxes and an accrual for this
  payment has been recorded in the financial statements as of August 31,
  1994.  The Company will fund the payment due on December 30, 1994 through
  Revolving Loans.  The remaining payments are contingent upon Barton
  achieving and exceeding certain targets for earnings before interest and
  taxes and are to be made as follows:  up to $10 million is to be made on
  November 30, 1995; and up to $15 million is to be made on November 29,
  1996.  Such payment obligations are secured in part by the Company's
  standby irrevocable letter of credit under the Credit Facility in an
  original maximum face amount of the Barton Letter of Credit and are
  subject to acceleration in certain events.  All Earn-Out payments will be
  accounted for as additional purchase price for the Barton Acquisition
  when the contingencies have been satisfied and will be allocated based
  upon the fair market value of the underlying assets.  As a result, when
  the contingencies have been satisfied, depreciation and amortization
  expense will increase in the future over the remaining useful lives of
  these assets.

    At the closing of the Vintners Acquisition, the Company held back from
  Vintners $8.4 million of the Vintners cash consideration, which
  represents 10% of the then estimated net current assets of Vintners
  purchased by the Company (the "Held-back Amount") and deposited an
  additional $2.8 million of the Vintners cash consideration into an escrow
  account to be held until October 15, 1995.  Subsequent to the Vintners
  Acquisition, the corporation formerly known as Vintners ("Old Vintners")
  delivered a final closing net asset statement which indicated that the
  purchase price should be reduced by $700,000.  The Company believes that
  the net current assets as reflected on the initial closing net asset
  statement were overstated by approximately $14 million.  The Company and
  Old Vintners have been unable to resolve their differences and the
<PAGE>

  Company expects that the final net asset amount will be determined by an
  independent accounting firm (the "Unaffiliated Firm") under the terms of
  the acquisition agreement.  The decision of the Unaffiliated Firm will be
  final and binding upon the parties.  In the event it is determined that
  the purchase price should be reduced by less than $8.4 million then the
  Company shall pay the difference into the established escrow.  If the
  purchase price is to be reduced by more than $8.4 million, then the
  Company will retain the Held-back Amount and will be paid the amount in
  excess of $8.4 million out of the escrow account up to the amount held in
  the escrow account.  Any amounts remaining in the escrow account will be
  held to reimburse the Company for any indemnification claims arising out
  of the Vintners Acquisition.

    As part of the Restructuring Plan, the Company has taken an after-tax
  restructuring charge in the fourth quarter of fiscal 1994 of $14.9
  million, or $0.91 per share on a fully diluted basis.  Approximately 60%
  of the restructuring charge relates to the revaluation of affected assets
  which will not involve cash expenditures.  Implementation of the
  Restructuring Plan will require cash expenditures of approximately $27.1
  million, including $20.0 million or capital expenditures, during fiscal
  1995.  Upon relocation of the bottling facilities and other equipment
  from Central Cellars and Soledad wineries, these wineries will be closed
  and offered for sale.  Net proceeds from the dispositions of discontinued
  operations and other assets in excess of $10.0 million are required to
  pay down Term Loans if the proceeds are not reinvested within one year in
  similar assets.  The capital expenditures will be funded through the
  Credit Facility.  The Company anticipates that the Restructuring Plan
  will result in net cost savings of approximately $1.7 million in fiscal
  1995 and approximately $13.3 million of annual net cost savings beginning
  in fiscal 1996.

    The Company engages in operations at its facilities for the purpose of
  disposing of waste and by-products generated in its production process. 
  These operations include the treatment of waste water to comply with
  regulatory requirements prior to disposal in public facilities or upon
  property owned by the Company or others and do not constitute a material
  part of the Company's overall cost of product sold.  Expenditures for the
  purpose of maintaining or improving the Company's waste water treatment
  facilities have not constituted a material part of the Company's
  maintenance or capital expenditures over the last three fiscal years and
  the Company does not expect to incur any such material expenditures
  during its 1995 fiscal year.  During the last three fiscal years the Company has
  not incurred, nor does it expect to incur in its 1995 fiscal year, any
  material expenditures related to remediation of previously contaminated
  sites or other non-recurring environmental matters.

    The Company believes that cash flow from operations will provide
  sufficient funds to meet all of its anticipated short and long-term debt
  service.  The Company is not aware of any potential impairment to its

  resources to satisfy its working capital, liquidity and anticipated
  capital expenditure requirements for at least the next four fiscal
  quarters.

                   REPORT OF INDEPENDENT PUBLIC ACCOUNTANTS



  To Canandaigua Wine Company, Inc.:
<PAGE>

  We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of
  CANANDAIGUA WINE COMPANY, INC. (a Delaware corporation) and subsidiaries
  as of August 31, 1994 and 1993, and the related consolidated statements
  of income, changes in stockholders' equity and cash flows for each of the
  three years in the period ended August 31, 1994.  These financial
  statements and supplementary schedules referred to below are the
  responsibility of the Company's management.  Our responsibility is to
  express an opinion on these financial statements and supplemental
  schedules based on our audits.

  We conducted our audits in accordance with generally accepted auditing
  standards.  Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to
  obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are
  free of material misstatement.  An audit includes examining, on a test
  basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial
  statements.  An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles
  used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating
  the overall financial statement presentation.  We believe that our audits
  provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.

  In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present
  fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of Canandaigua
  Wine Company, Inc. and subsidiaries as of August 31, 1994 and 1993, and
  the results of their operations and their cash flows for each of the
  three years in the period ended August 31, 1994, in conformity with
  generally accepted accounting principles.

  Our audits were made for the purpose of forming an opinion on the basic
  financial statements taken as a whole.  The schedules listed in the index
  to consolidated financial statements and supplemental schedules are
  presented for purposes of complying with the Securities and Exchange
  Commission's rules and are not part of the basic financial statements. 
  These schedules have been subjected to the auditing procedures applied in
  the audits of the basic financial statements and, in our opinion, fairly
  state in all material respects the financial data required to be set
  forth therein in relation to the basic financial statements taken as a
  whole.

                  NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

                               AUGUST 31, 1994

  1. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES:

  Description of business -
  Canandaigua Wine Company, Inc. and subsidiaries operates in the beverage
  alcohol industry and, as of August 31, 1994, is a producer and supplier
  of wine, an importer and producer of beers,
  a producer and supplier of distilled
  spirits and a producer and supplier of grape juice concentrate in the
  United States.  It maintains a  portfolio of over 125 national and
  regional brands of beverage alcohol which are distributed by over 1,000
  wholesalers throughout the United States and selected international
  markets.  Its beverage alcohol brands are marketed in five general
  categories: table wines, sparkling wines, dessert wines, imported beer
  and distilled spirits.

  Principles of consolidation -
  The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Canandaigua
  Wine Company, Inc. and subsidiaries (the Company), all of which are
  wholly-owned.  All intercompany accounts and transactions have been
  eliminated.

  Cash investments -
  Cash investments consist of money market funds that are stated at cost,
  which approximates market value.  These investments amounted to
  approximately $10,000 and $8,000 at August 31, 1994 and 1993,
  respectively.

  Fair Value of Financial Instruments -
  To meet the reporting requirements of FASB Statement No. 107
  ("Disclosures About Fair Value of Financial Instruments"), the Company
  calculates the fair value of financial instruments and includes this
  additional information in the notes to financial statements when the fair
  value is different than the book value of those financial instruments. 
  When the fair value is equal to the book value no additional disclosure
  is made.  The Company uses quoted market prices whenever available to
  calculate these fair values.  When quoted market prices are not
  available, the Company uses standard pricing models for various types of
  financial instruments (such as forwards, options, swaps, etc.) which take
  into account the present value of estimated future cash flows.   

  Interest rate futures and currency forward contracts -
  From time to time, the Company enters into interest rate futures and a
  variety of currency forward contracts in management of interest rate risk
  and foreign currency transaction exposure.  Unrealized gains and losses
  on interest rate futures are deferred and recognized as a component of
  interest expense over the borrowing period.  Unrealized gains and losses
  on foreign currency forward contracts are deferred and recognized as a
  component of the related transactions in the accompanying financial
  statements.  Discounts or premiums on forward contracts are recognized
  over the life of the contract.

  Inventories -
<PAGE>

  Inventories are valued at the lower of cost (computed using the last-in,
  first-out (LIFO) or first-in, first-out (FIFO) methods) or market.  The
  percentage of inventories valued using the LIFO method is 95% and 88% at
  August 31, 1994 and 1993, respectively.  Replacement cost of the
  inventories determined on a FIFO basis approximated $289,209,000 and
  $146,421,000 at August 31, 1994 and 1993, respectively.  At August 31,
  1994 and 1993, the net realizable value of the Company's inventories was
  in excess of $301,053,000 and $147,165,000, respectively.  During fiscal
  1993, the Company had a liquidation of certain inventories
  valued on a LIFO basis, resulting in a reduction of cost of product sold
  of approximately $1,112,000.

  Elements of cost include materials, labor and overhead and consist of the
  following at August 31:

</TABLE>

  Property, plant and equipment -
  Property, plant and equipment is stated at cost.  Major additions and
  betterments are charged to property accounts, while maintenance and
  repairs are charged to operations as incurred.  The cost of properties
  sold or otherwise disposed of and the related allowance for depreciation
  are eliminated from the accounts at the time of disposal and resulting
  gains or losses are included as a component of operating income.

  Other assets -
  Other assets which consist of goodwill, distribution rights, agency
  license agreements, trademarks, deferred financing costs, cash surrender
  value of officers' life insurance and other amounts, are stated at cost,
  net of accumulated amortization.  Amortization is calculated on a
  straight-line or effective interest basis over periods ranging from five
  to forty years.  At August 31, 1994, the weighted average of the
  remaining useful lives of these assets was approximately thirty-five
  years.  The face value of the officers' life insurance policies totaled
  $2,852,000 in both 1994 and 1993.

  Depreciation -
  Depreciation is computed primarily using the straight-line method over
  the following estimated useful lives:

          Description                         Depreciable Life
      Buildings and improvements              10 to 33 1/3 years
      Machinery and equipment                 7 to 15 years
      Motor vehicles                          3 to 7 years

  Amortization of assets capitalized under capital leases is included with
  depreciation expense.  Amortization is calculated using the straight-line
  method over the shorter of the estimated useful life of the asset or the
  lease term.

  Income taxes -
<PAGE>

  The Company uses the liability method of accounting for income taxes. 
  The liability method accounts for deferred income taxes by applying
  statutory rates in effect at the balance sheet date to the difference
  between the financial reporting and tax basis of assets and liabilities. 
  In fiscal 1992, the Company adopted Statement of Financial Accounting
  Standards No. 109, "Accounting for Income Taxes" which replaced Statement
  of Financial Accounting Standards No. 96, which was the standard the
  Company previously used.  The cumulative effect of this change in
  accounting principle was not material to the Company's financial
  statements and was included in the fiscal 1992 tax provision.

  Environmental -
  Environmental expenditures that relate to current operations are expensed
  or capitalized as appropriate.  Expenditures that relate to an existing
  condition caused by past operations, and which do not contribute to
  current or future revenue generation, are expensed.  Liabilities are
  recorded when environmental assessments and/or remedial efforts are
  probable, and the cost can be reasonably estimated.  Generally, the
  timing of these accruals coincides with completion of a feasibility study
  or the Company's commitment to a formal plan of action.  At August
  31,1994 and 1993, liabilities for environmental costs of $100,000 and
  $1,300,000, respectively, are recorded in other accrued liabilities.

  Common stock -
  The Company has two classes of common stock: Class A Common Stock and
  Class B Common Stock.  Class B Common Stock shares are convertible into
  shares of Class A Common Stock on a one-to-one basis at any time at the
  option of the holder.  Holders of Class B Common Stock are entitled to
  ten votes per share.  Holders of Class A Common Stock are entitled to
  only one vote per share but are entitled to a cash dividend premium.  If
  the Company pays a cash dividend on Class B Common Stock, each share of
  Class A Common Stock will receive an amount at least ten percent greater
  than the amount of the cash dividend per share paid on Class B Common
  Stock.  In addition, the Board of Directors may declare and pay a
  dividend on Class A Common Stock without paying any dividend on Class B
  Common Stock.

  On September 26, 1991 and June 1, 1992, the Company approved
  three-for-two stock splits of both Class A and Class B Common Stock to
  stockholders of record on October 11, 1991 and June 22, 1992,
  respectively.  All references in the consolidated financial statements to
  weighted average number of shares and issued shares have been
  retroactively restated to reflect the splits (see Note 10).

  Net income per common and common equivalent share -
  Primary net income per common and common equivalent share is based on the
  weighted average number of common and common equivalent shares (stock
  options and stock appreciation rights determined under the treasury stock
  method) outstanding during the year for Class A Common Stock and Class B
  Common Stock.  Fully diluted earnings per common and common equivalent
  share assumes the conversion of the 7% convertible subordinated
  debentures under the "if converted method" and assumes exercise of stock
  options and stock appreciation rights using the treasury stock method.

  All share and per share amounts have been adjusted for the three-for-two
  stock splits (see Note 10).

  2. ACQUISITIONS:

  Guild -
  On October 1, 1991, the Company acquired Cook's, Cribari, Dunnewood and
  other brands and substantially all of the assets and assumed certain
  liabilities (the Guild Acquisition) from Guild Wineries and Distilleries
  (Guild).  The assets acquired included accounts receivable, inventories,
  property, plant and equipment and other assets.  The Company also assumed
  certain liabilities consisting primarily of accounts payable.  The
  aggregate purchase price, after adjustments based on a post-closing
  audit, was approximately $69,300,000.  With respect to the purchase
  price, the Company paid approximately $59,400,000 in cash at closing,
  assumed liabilities of approximately $11,400,000 of which approximately
  $1,600,000 was discharged immediately and, based upon the results of a
  post-closing audit, received from Guild during October 1992 approximately
  $1,500,000, exclusive of accrued interest.  The Company also paid
  approximately $2,700,000 of direct acquisition costs and $2,600,000 in
  escrow to finance the purchase of grapes related to Guild's 1991 grape
  harvest.

  The Guild Acquisition was accounted for using the purchase method;
  accordingly, the assets and liabilities of Guild have been recorded at
  their estimated fair market value at the date of acquisition.  The excess
  of purchase price over the estimated fair market value of the net assets
  acquired (goodwill), $1,344,000, is being amortized on a straight-line
  basis over forty years.  The results of operations of Guild have been
  included in the Consolidated Statements of Income since the date of
  acquisition.

  Barton -
  On June 29, 1993, pursuant to the terms of a Stock Purchase Agreement
  (the Stock Purchase Agreement) among the Company, Barton Incorporated
  (Barton) and the Selling Stockholders, the Company acquired from the
  Selling Stockholders all of the outstanding shares of the capital stock
  of Barton (the Barton Acquisition),
  a marketer of imported beers and imported distilled spirits
  and a producer and marketer of distilled spirits and domestic beers.

  The aggregate consideration for Barton consisted of approximately
  $65,510,000 in cash, one million shares of the Company's Class A Common
  Stock and payments of up to an aggregate amount of $57,300,000 (the
  Earn-Out Amounts) which are payable to the Selling Stockholders in cash
  over a three year period upon the satisfaction of certain performance
  goals.  In addition, the Company paid approximately $1,981,000 of direct
  acquisition costs, $2,269,000 of direct financing costs, and assumed
  liabilities of approximately $47,926,000.

  The purchase price was funded through a $50,000,000 term loan (see Note
  7), through $18,835,000 of revolving loans under the Company's Credit
  Agreement (see Note 7), and through approximately $925,000 of accrued
  expenses.  In addition, one million shares of the Company's Class A
  Common Stock were issued at $13.59 per share, which reflects the closing
  market price of the stock at the closing date, discounted for certain
  restrictions on the issued shares.  Of these shares, 428,571 were 
  delivered to the Selling Stockholders and 571,429 were delivered into
  escrow to secure the Selling Stockholders' indemnification obligations to
  the Company.  Subsequent to year end, the 571,429 shares were released
  from escrow and delivered to the Selling Stockholders.
<PAGE>

  The Earn-Out Amounts consist of four payments scheduled to be made over a
  three year period ending November 29, 1996.  The first payment of
  $4,000,000 is required to be made to the Selling Stockholders upon
  satisfaction of certain performance goals.  These goals have been
  satisfied and this payment was accrued at August 31, 1993 and was made on
  December 31, 1993.  The second payment of $28,300,000 has been accrued at
  August 31, 1994 and will be made to the Selling Stockholders on December
  30, 1994, as a result of satisfaction of certain performance goals and
  the achievement of targets for earnings before interest and taxes at
  August 31, 1994.  These additional payments have been properly accounted
  for as additional purchase price for the Barton acquisition.  The
  remaining payments are contingent upon Barton achieving and exceeding
  certain targets for earnings before interest and taxes and certain other
  performance goals and are to be made as follows: up to $10,000,000 is to
  be made on November 30, 1995; and up to $15,000,000 is to be made on
  November 29, 1996.  Such payment obligations are secured in part by the
  Company's standby irrevocable letter of credit (see Note 7) under the
  Credit Agreement in an original maximum face amount of $28,200,000 and
  are subject to acceleration in certain events as defined in the Stock
  Purchase Agreement.  All Earn-Out amounts will be accounted for as
  additional purchase price for the Barton acquisition when the contingency
  has been satisfied in accordance with the Stock Purchase Agreement and
  allocated based upon the fair market value of the underlying assets.

  Pursuant to Barton's Phantom Stock Plan (the Phantom Stock Plan)
  effective April 1, 1990 and amended and restated for Units (as defined in
  the Phantom Stock Plan) granted after March 31, 1992, certain
  participants received payments at closing amounting in the aggregate to
  $1,959,000 in connection with the Barton acquisition.  Certain other
  participants will receive payments only upon vesting in the Phantom Stock
  Plan during years subsequent to the acquisition.  All participants under
  the Phantom Stock Plan may receive additional payments in the event of
  satisfaction of the performance goals set forth in the Stock Purchase
  Agreement and upon release of the shares held in escrow.  In the event
  the maximum payments are received under the Stock Purchase Agreement, the
  participants will receive an additional $2,137,000 in connection
  therewith.  At August 31, 1994, $554,000 has been accrued under the
  Phantom Stock Plan and will be paid on January  3, 1995.

  The Acquisition was accounted for using the purchase method; accordingly,
  Barton's assets were recorded at fair market value at the date of
  acquisition.  The fair market value of Barton totaled $236,178,000 which
  was adjusted for negative goodwill of $72,390,000 and an additional
  deferred tax liability of $24,326,000 based on the difference between the
  fair market value of Barton's assets and liabilities as adjusted for
  allocation of negative goodwill and the tax basis of those assets and
  liabilities which was allocated on a pro-rata basis to noncurrent assets. 
  The results of operations of Barton have been included in the
  Consolidated Statements of Income since the date of Acquisition.

  Vintners -
  On October 15, 1993, the Company acquired substantially all of the
  tangible and intangible assets of Vintners International Company, Inc.
  (Vintners) other than cash and the Hammondsport Winery (the Vintners
  Assets), and assumed certain current liabilities associated with the
  ongoing business (the Vintners Acquisition).  Vintners was the United
  States fifth largest supplier of wine with two of the country's most
<PAGE>

  highly recognized brands, Paul Masson and Taylor California Cellars.  The
  wineries acquired from Vintners are the Gonzales winery in Gonzales,
  California and the Paul Masson wineries in Madera and Soledad,
  California.  In addition, the Company is leasing from Vintners the
  Hammondsport winery in Hammondsport, New York.  The lease is for a period
  of 18 months from the date of the Vintners Acquisition.

  The aggregate purchase price of $148,900,000 (the Cash Consideration), is
  subject to adjustment based upon the determination of the Final Net
  Current Asset Amount (as defined below).  In addition, the Company
  incurred $8,961,000 of direct acquisition and financing costs.  The
  Company also delivered options to Vintners and Household Commercial of
  California, Inc., one of Vintners' lenders, to purchase an aggregate of
  500,000 shares (the Vintners Option Shares) of the Company's Class A
  Common Stock, at an exercise price per share of $18.25, which are
  exercisable at any time until October 15, 1996.  These options have been
  recorded at $8.42 per share, based upon an independent appraisal and
  $4,210,000 has been reflected as a component of additional
  paid-in capital.  Subsequent to year-end, 432,067 of the Vintners Option
  Shares have been exercised (see Note 10).

  The Cash Consideration was funded by the Company pursuant to (i)
  approximately $12,600,000 of Revolving Loans under the Credit Facility of
  which $11,200,000 funded the Cash Consideration and $1,400,000 funded the
  payment of direct acquisition costs; (ii) an accrued liability of
  approximately $7,700,000 for the holdback described below and (iii) the
  $130,000,000 Subordinated Bank Loan (see Note 7).

  At closing the Company held back from the Cash Consideration
  approximately 10% of the then estimated net current assets of Vintners
  purchased by the Company, and deposited an additional $2,800,000 of the
  Cash Consideration into an escrow to be held until October 15, 1995.  If
  the amount of the net current assets as determined after the closing (the
  Final Net Current Asset Amount) is greater than 90% and less than 100% of
  the amount of net current assets estimated at closing (the Estimated Net
  Current Asset Amount), then the Company shall pay into the established
  escrow an amount equal to the Final Net Current Asset Amount less 90% of
  the Estimated Net Current Asset Amount.  If the Final Net Current Asset
  Amount is greater than the Estimated Net Current Asset Amount, then, in
  addition to the payment described above, the Company shall pay an amount
  equal to such excess, plus interest from the closing, to Vintners.  If
  the Final Net Current Asset Amount is less than 90% of the Estimated Net
  Current Asset Amount, then the Company shall be paid such deficiency out
  of the escrow account.  As of August 31, 1994, no adjustment to the
  established escrow was required and the Final Net Current Asset Amount
  has not been determined.

  The Vintners Acquisition was accounted for using the purchase method;
  accordingly, the Vintners Assets were recorded at fair market value at
  the date of acquisition.  The excess of the purchase price over the
  estimated fair market value of the net assets acquired (goodwill),
  $42,049,000, is being amortized on a straight-line basis over forty
  years.  The results of operations of Vintners have been included in the
  Consolidated Statements of Income since the date of acquisition.

  Almaden/Inglenook -
<PAGE>

  On August 5, 1994 the Company acquired the Almaden and Inglenook brands,
  the fifth and sixth largest selling table wines in the United States, a
  grape juice concentrate business, and wineries in Madera and Escalon,
  California, from Heublein, Inc. (Heublein) (the Almaden/Inglenook
  Acquisition).  The Company also acquired Belaire Creek Cellars, Chateau
  La Salle and Charles Le Franc table wines, Le Domaine champagne and
  Almaden, Hartley and Jacques Bonet brandy.  The accounts receivable and
  the accounts payable related to the acquired assets were not acquired by
  the Company.

  The aggregate consideration for the acquired brands and other assets
  consisted of $130,600,000 in cash, assumption of certain current
  liabilities and options to purchase an aggregate of 600,000 shares of
  Class A Common Stock (the Almaden Option Shares).  Of the Almaden Option
  Shares, 200,000 are exercisable at a price of $30 per share and the
  remaining 400,000 are exercisable at a price of $35 per share.  All of
  the options are exercisable at any time until August 5, 1996.  The
  200,000 and 400,000 options have been recorded at $5.83 and $4.19  per
  share, respectively based upon an independent appraisal, and $2,842,000
  has been reflected as a component of additional paid-in capital.  The
  source of the cash payment made at closing, together with payment of
  other costs and expenses required by the Almaden/Inglenook Acquisition,
  was financing provided by the Company pursuant to a  term loan under the
  Credit Facility (see Note 7).

  The cash purchase price is subject to adjustment based upon the
  determination of the Final Net Asset Amount as defined in the Asset
  Purchase Agreement; and, based upon a closing statement delivered to the
  company by Heublein, was reduced by $9,297,000.  In accordance with the
  terms of the Asset Purchase Agreement, Heublein is obligated to the pay
  Company this amount plus interest from the closing date.  The purchase
  price for the Almaden/Inglenook Acquisition at August 31, 1994, reflects
  the purchase price as adjusted for the payment expected to be received
  from Heublein.  However, as of August 31, 1994, the Final Net Asset
  Amount has not been determined.

  Heublein also agreed not to compete with the Company in the United States
  and Canada for a period of five years following the closing of the
  Almaden/Inglenook Acquisition in the production and sale of grape juice
  concentrate or sale of packaged wines bearing the designation "Chablis"
  or "Burgundy" except where, among other exceptions, such designations are
  currently used with certain brands retained by Heublein.  Certain
  companies acquired by Heublein, however, may compete directly with the
  Company.

  The Almaden/Inglenook Acquisition was accounted for using the purchase
  method; accordingly, the Almaden/Inglenook assets were recorded at fair
  market value at the date of acquisition.  The excess of purchase price
  over the estimated fair market value of the net assets acquired
  (goodwill), $43,939,000, is being amortized on a straight-line basis over
  forty years.  The results of operations of Almaden/Inglenook have been
  included in the Consolidated Statement of Income since the date of the
  acquisition.

  The following table sets forth unaudited pro forma consolidated
  statements of income of the Company for the years ended August 31, 1994
  and 1993.  The fiscal 1994 pro forma consolidated statement of income
<PAGE>

  gives effect to the Almaden/Inglenook Acquisition and the Vintners
  Acquisition as if they occurred on September 1, 1993.  The fiscal 1993 
  pro forma consolidated statement of  income gives effect to the
  Almaden/Inglenook Acquisition, the Vintners Acquisition and the Barton
  Acquisition as if they occurred on September 1, 1992.  The August 31,
  1994 and 1993 unaudited pro forma consolidated income statements are
  presented after giving effect to certain adjustments for depreciation,
  amortization of goodwill, interest expense on the acquisition financing
  and related income tax effects.  The pro forma consolidated statements of
  income are based upon currently available information and upon certain
  assumptions that the Company believes are reasonable under the
  circumstances.  The pro forma  consolidated statements of income do not
  purport to represent what the Company's results of operations would
  actually have been if the aforementioned transactions in fact had
  occurred on such date or at the beginning of the period indicated or to
  project the Company's financial position or results of operations at any
  future date or for any future period.

  Senior Credit Facility -
  During fiscal 1993, the Company amended its Credit Agreement which
  provided for $50,000,000 of term loans, up to $55,000,000 in revolving
  credit loans and a standby, irrevocable letter of credit with a maximum
<PAGE>

  face amount of $28,200,000.  At August 31, 1993, the Company had
  outstanding borrowings of $50,000,000 under the term loan and $9,000,000
  under the Revolving Credit Loans.  At August 31, 1993, the Company had
  available Revolving Credit Loans totaling $46,000,000 under the amended
  Credit Agreement.  Interest, as described in the agreement, was payable
  quarterly or on the last day of each interest period based upon either
  the base rate (higher of the Federal Funds Rate plus 1/2 of 1% or the
  bank's prime rate) or the Eurodollar rate, as defined in the Credit
  Agreement, at the discretion of the Company.

  During fiscal 1994, the Company further amended its Credit Agreement in
  connection with the Vintners and the Almaden/Inglenook Acquisitions.  The
  amended Credit facility provides for (i) a $224,000,000 Term Loan (the
  Term Loan) facility due in June 2000, (ii) a $185,000,000 Revolving
  Credit (the Revolving Credit Loans) facility, which expires in June 2000
  and (iii) the continuation of the existing $28,200,000 Letter of Credit
  related to the contingent payments incurred with the Barton Acquisition. 
  At August 31, 1994, the Company has outstanding Term Loan borrowings of
  $177,000,000 and Revolving Credit Loans of $19,000,000.  On October 24,
  1994 the Company borrowed an additional $47,000,000 on the Term Loan and
  used the proceeds to repay a portion of the outstanding balance on the
  Revolving Credit Loans incurred since August 31, 1994.  The Term Loan
  Commitment was fully utilized after this borrowing.  The Term Loans
  borrowed under the Credit Facility may be either base rate loans or
  Eurodollar base rate loans.  Base rate loans have an interest rate equal
  to the higher of either the Federal Funds rate plus 0.5% or the prime
  rate.  Eurodollar rate loans have an interest rate equal to LIBOR plus a
  margin of 1.25%.  The current interest rate margin for both base rate and
  Eurodollar rate loans may be increased by up to 0.25% and Eurodollar rate
  loans may be decreased by up to .375%, depending on the Company's debt
  coverage ratio and long-term senior secured securities' ratings.  The
  principal of the Term Loans is to be repaid in twenty-two quarterly
  installments of $7,000,000 each beginning December 15, 1994, with a final
  quarterly payment of $70,000,000 due June 15, 2000.  The Company may
  prepay the principal of the Term Loans and the Revolving Credit Loans at
  its discretion and must prepay the principal with 65% of its annual
  excess cash flow, as defined, with proceeds from the sale of certain
  assets in excess of $10,000,000 and the first $60,000,000 of the net
  proceeds from any issuance of equity plus 50% of any net proceeds in
  excess of $60,000,000 (see Note 10).  These prepayments must be first
  applied against regular payments due with respect to the Term Loans in
  their inverse order of maturity until the Term Loans are fully retired
  and any further prepayments will be applied to reduce the outstanding
  Revolving Credit Loans.

  The $185,000,000 revolving credit available under the Credit Facility may
  be utilized by the Company either in the form of Revolving Credit Loans
  or as revolving letters of credit up to a maximum of $12,000,000.  At
  August 31, 1994 the Company had available Revolving Credit Loans under
  the Senior Credit Facility of $163,753,000.  As with Term Loans,
  Revolving Credit Loans may be either base rate loans or Eurodollar rate
  loans.  Revolving Credit Loans will mature and must be repaid June 15,
  2000.  For thirty consecutive days at any time during the last two
  quarters of each fiscal year, the aggregate outstanding principal amount
  of Revolving Credit Loans combined with the revolving letters of credit
  cannot exceed $50,000,000.
<PAGE>

  The banks under the Credit Facility have been given security interests in
  substantially all of the
  assets of the Company including mortgage liens on certain real property. 
  The Credit Facility requires the Company to meet certain covenants and
  provides for restrictions on mergers, consolidations and sales of assets,
  payment of dividends, incurring of other debt, liens or guarantees and
  the making of investments.  The primary financial covenants as defined in
  the Credit Facility require the maintenance of minimum defined tangible
  net worth, a debt to cash flow coverage ratio, a fixed charges ratio,
  maximum capital expenditures, an interest coverage ratio and a current
  ratio.  Among the most restrictive covenants contained in the Credit
  Facility, the Company is required to maintain a fixed charges ratio not
  less than 1.0 to 1.0 at the last day of each fiscal quarter of each
  fiscal year.

  The Revolving Credit Loans require commitment fees totaling
  .375% per annum on the daily average unused balance.  Commitment fees
  totaled approximately $223,000, $228,000 and $154,000 in fiscal 1994,
  1993 and 1992, respectively. 

  The Company maintains in accordance with the Senior Credit Facility a
  collar agreement, which protects the Company against three-month London
  Interbank Offered Rates exceeding 7.5% per annum with a floor rate of 3.3%
  per annum in an amount equal to $25,000,000 expiring in July 1995.   At
  August 31, 1993, there were no interest rate swap agreements outstanding. 
  At August 31, 1992, the Company had a contract applicable to $22,000,000
  of short-term seasonal borrowings which effectively guaranteed a fixed
  interest rate of 6.82% for seasonal borrowing during the four month
  period ended September 15, 1992.  The Company is exposed to credit loss
  in the event of nonperformance by the other parties to the interest rate
  swap agreements.  The Company has not incurred any credit losses in
  connection with these agreements.

  Senior Subordinated Notes -
  During fiscal 1994, the Company borrowed $130,000,000 under the Senior
  Subordinated Loan Agreement.  The Company repaid the Subordinated Loan in
  December 1993 from the proceeds from the Senior Subordinated Notes
  offering together with revolving loan borrowings.  The $130,000,000 Notes
  are due in 2003 with a stated interest rate of 8.75% per annum.  Interest
  is payable semi-annually on June 15 and December 15 of each year.  The
  Notes are unsecured and subordinated to the prior payment in full of all
  senior indebtedness of the Company, which includes the Credit Agreement. 
  The Notes are guaranteed, on a senior subordinated basis, by
  all of the Company's significant operating subsidiaries.

  The indenture relating to the Notes contains certain covenants,
  including, but not limited to, (i) limitation on indebtedness; (ii)
  limitation on restricted payments; (iii) limitation on transactions with
  affiliates; (iv) limitation on senior subordinated indebtedness; (v)
  limitation on liens; (vi) limitation on sale of assets; (vii) limitation
  on issuance of guarantees of and pledges for indebtedness; (viii)
  restriction on transfer of assets; (ix) limitation on subsidiary capital
  stock; (x) limitation on the creation of any restriction on the ability
  of the Company's subsidiaries to make distributions and other payments;
  and (xi) restrictions on mergers, consolidations and the transfer of all
  or substantially all of the assets of the Company to another person.  The
  limitation on indebtedness covenant is governed by a rolling four quarter
  fixed charge coverage ratio covenant requiring a specified minimum.

  Convertible subordinated debentures -
<PAGE>

  On July 23, 1986, the Company issued $60,000,000 7% convertible
  subordinated debentures used to expand the Company's operations through
  capital expenditures and acquisitions.  The debentures were convertible
  at any time prior to maturity, unless previously redeemed, into Class A
  Common Stock of the Company at a conversion price of $18.22 per share,
  subject to adjustment in the event of future issuances of Common Stock.  

  During fiscal 1993, an aggregate principal amount of $977,000 of these
  debentures was converted to 53,620 shares of Class A Common Stock.

  On October 18, 1993, the Company called its Convertible Debentures for
  redemption on November 19, 1993 at a redemption price of 102.1% plus
  accrued interest.  Bondholders had until November 19, 1993 to convert
  their debentures to common stock; any debentures remaining unconverted
  after that date would be redeemed for cash in accordance with the terms
  of the original indenture.

  During the period September 1, 1993, through November 19, 1993,
  debentures in an aggregate principal amount of $58,960,000 were converted
  to 3,235,882 shares of the Company's Class A Common Stock at a price of
  $18.22 per share.  Debentures in an aggregate principal amount of
  approximately $63,000 were redeemed.  Interest was accrued on the
  debentures until the date of conversion but was forfeited by the
  debenture holders upon conversion.  Accrued interest of approximately
  $1,370,000, net of the related tax effect of $520,000 was recorded as an
  addition to additional paid-in capital.  

  At the redemption date, the capitalized debenture issuance costs of
  approximately $2,246,000 net of accumulated amortization of approximately
  $677,000 were recorded as a reduction of additional paid-in-capital.

  Loans payable -
  Loans payable, secured by officers' life insurance policies, carry an
  interest rate of 5%.  The notes carry no due dates and it is management's
  intention not to repay the notes during the next fiscal year.

  Capitalized lease agreements-Industrial Development Agencies -
  Certain capitalized lease agreements require the Company to make lease
  payments equal to the principal and interest on certain bonds issued by
  Industrial Development Agencies (IDA's).  The bonds are secured by the
  leases and the related facilities.  Upon payment of the outstanding
  bonds, title to the facilities will be conveyed to the Company.  These
  transactions have been treated as capital leases with the related assets
  acquired to date ($10,731,000) included in property, plant and equipment
  and the lease commitments included in long-term debt.  Accumulated
  amortization of the foregoing assets under capital leases at August 31,
  1994 and 1993 is approximately $8,456,000 and $7,803,000 respectively.

  Among the provisions under the debenture and lease agreements are
  covenants that define minimum levels of working capital and tangible net
  worth and the maintenance of certain financial ratios as defined in the
  debt agreements.

  Principal payments required under long-term debt obligations during the
  next five fiscal years are as follows:

  8. INCOME TAXES:

  Deferred income taxes are provided to reflect the effect of temporary
  differences primarily related to: (1) using the FIFO basis to value
  certain inventories for income tax purposes and the LIFO basis for
  financial reporting purposes; (2) the use of accelerated depreciation
  methods for income tax purposes and the straight-line method for
  financial reporting purposes; (3) differences in the treatment of
  advertising expense and other accruals for financial reporting and income
  tax purposes and (4) differences between the financial reporting and tax
  basis of assets and liabilities.
   
  The provision for federal and state income taxes consists of the following

  9.  PROFIT SHARING RETIREMENT PLAN AND RETIREMENT SAVINGS PLAN:

  The Company's profit-sharing retirement plan, which covers substantially
  all employees, provides for contributions by the Company in such amounts
  as the Board of Directors may annually determine and for voluntary
  contributions by employees.  The plan has qualified as tax-exempt under
  the Internal Revenue Code and conforms with the Employee Retirement
  Income Security Act of 1974.   Company contributions to the plan were
  $3,414,000, $1,290,000, and $1,249,000 in fiscal 1994, 1993 and 1992,
  respectively.

  The Company's retirement savings plan, established pursuant to Section
  401(k) of the Internal Revenue Code, permits substantially all full-time
  employees of the Company to defer a portion of their compensation on a
  pre-tax basis.  Participants may defer up to 10% of their compensation
  for the year.  The Company makes a matching contribution of 25% of the
  first 4% of compensation an employee defers.  Company contributions to
  this plan were $207,000, $131,000, and $109,000 in fiscal 1994, 1993 ,
  1992, respectively.

  In connection with the Barton acquisition, the Company assumed Barton's
  profit-sharing plan which covers all salaried employees.  The amount of
  Barton's contribution is at the discretion of its Board of Directors,
  subject to limitations of the plan.  Contribution expense was $1,395,000
  in fiscal 1994 and $230,000 from the date of acquisition to August 31,
  1993.

  10.  STOCKHOLDERS' EQUITY:

  Stock option and stock appreciation right plan -
  Canandaigua Wine Company, Inc. has in place a Stock Option and Stock
  Appreciation Right Plan (the Plan).  Under the Plan, non-qualified
  stock options and incentive
  stock options may be granted to purchase and stock appreciation rights
  may be granted with respect to, in the aggregate, not more than 3,000,000
  shares of the Company's Class A Common Stock.  Options
  and stock appreciation rights may be issued to employees, officers, or
  directors of the Company.  Non-employee directors are eligible to receive
  only non-qualified stock options and stock appreciation rights.  The
  option price of any incentive stock option may not be less than the fair
  market value of the shares on the date of grant.  The exercise price of
  any non-qualified stock option must equal or exceed 50% of the fair
  market value of the shares on the date of grant.  
  Options are exercisable as determined by the Compensation Committee of
  the Board of Directors.  Changes in the status of the stock option plan
  during fiscal 1994, 1993 and 1992 are summarized as follows:

</TABLE>

  Pursuant to the original Plan, on December 21, 1987, the Company granted
  to key employees stock appreciation rights with respect to 38,250 shares
  of the Company's Class A Common Stock at a base price of $4.40 per share
  (the average closing price per share for November 1987 adjusted for the
  effect of the stock splits).  Such rights entitled the employees to
  payment in stock and cash of market price increases in the Company's
  stock in the excess of the base price in equal twenty-five percent
  increments on September 30, 1989 through 1992.  In September 1992 and
  1991, employees exercised their stock appreciation rights with respect to
  4,104 and 2,556 shares of Class A Common Stock, respectively.  In
  addition, an aggregate of 4,950 of the rights were canceled through
  August 31, 1992.  During fiscal 1993, stock appreciation rights
  previously granted under the Plan expired in accordance with the terms of
  the Plan.
<PAGE>

  Employee stock purchase plan -
  In fiscal 1989, the Company approved a stock purchase plan under which
  1,125,000 shares of Class A Common Stock can be issued.  Under the terms
  of the plan, eligible employees may purchase shares of the Company's
  Class A Common Stock through payroll deductions.  The purchase price is
  the lower of 85% of the fair market value of the stock on the first or
  last day of the purchase period.  During fiscal 1993, the plan was
  amended to allow the participation of Barton employees.  During fiscal
  1994, 1993 and 1992, employees purchased 58,955, 21,071 and 18,526
  shares, respectively.

  Common stock -
  On September 26, 1991 and June 1, 1992, the Company's Board of Directors
  declared three-for-two splits of the Company's common shares.  The new
  shares were distributed on November 8, 1991 and July 20, 1992 to holders
  of record on October 11, 1991 and June 22, 1992, respectively.  At August
  31,1994, there were 12,617,301 shares of Class A Common Stock and
  3,390,051 shares of Class B Common Stock outstanding, net of treasury
  stock.  All per share amounts have been retroactively restated to give
  effect to the splits.

  On June 28, 1993, the Company approved an increase in the number of
  authorized shares of the Company's Class A Common Stock from 15,000,000
  shares to 60,000,000 shares and an increase in the number of authorized
  shares of the Company's Class B Common Stock from 5,000,000 shares to
  20,000,000 shares.

  Stock offering -
  During February 1992, the Company completed a public offering of
  2,589,750 shares of its Class A Common Stock resulting in net proceeds
  after underwriters' discounts and commissions and expenses to the
  Company, of approximately $31,981,000.  Under the terms of the Credit
  Agreement, approximately $16,000,000, constituting approximately 50% of
  the net proceeds, was applied to reduction of the Term Loans, and
  $5,000,000 was applied by the Company to reduce the balances outstanding
  under the Revolving Credit Loans.

  On November 10, 1994, the Company completed a public offering of
  3,000,000 shares of its Class A Common Stock resulting in net proceeds
  after underwriters' discounts and commissions and estimated expenses to
  the Company, of approximately $95,428,000 .  In connection with the
  offering, 432,067 of the Vintners Option Shares were exercised and the
  Company received proceeds of $7,885,000.  Under the terms of the amended
  Credit Agreement, approximately $82,000,000, will be used to repay a
  portion of the Term Loan under the Company's Credit Agreement.  The balance
  of net proceeds will be used for working capital purposes and will
  initially be used to repay Revolving Credit Loans under the Credit
  Facility.

  11.  COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES:

  Operating leases -
  Future payments under noncancelable operating leases having initial or
  remaining terms of one year or more are as follows:

                            Year ending August 31:
                                (in thousands)
                       1995              $1,487
                       1996               1,352
                       1997               1,358
                       1998               1,114
                       1999                 831
                       Thereafter         3,543
                                         $9,685


  Rental expense was approximately $3,318,000 in fiscal 1994, $1,841,000 in
  fiscal 1993 and  $1,460,000 in fiscal 1992.

  Purchase commitments -
  The Company has two agreements with certain suppliers to purchase blended
  Scotch whisky through December 31, 1999.  The purchase prices under the
  agreements are denominated in British pounds sterling and based upon
  exchange rates at August 31, 1994, the Company's aggregate
  future obligation will
  be approximately $13,124,000 to $16,306,000 for the contracts 
  expiring on December 31,
  1995 and approximately $11,160,000 to $13,640,000 for the contracts expiring
  on  December 31, 1999. 

  In connection with the Vintners Acquisition, and the Almaden/Inglenook
  Acquisition, the Company has assumed purchase contracts with certain
  growers and suppliers.  Under the grape purchase contracts, the Company
  is committed to purchase all grape production yielded from a specified
  number of acres for a period of time ranging up to ten years.  The actual
  tonnage and price of grapes that must be purchased by the Company will
  vary each year depending on certain factors, including weather, time of
  harvest, overall market conditions and the agricultural practices and
  location of the growers and suppliers under contract.

  The Company purchased $ 25,167,000 of grapes under these
  contracts during the period October 15, 1993 through August 31, 1994.  
  Based on current production yields and published grape prices, the
  Company estimates that the aggregate purchases under these contracts over
  the remaining term of the contracts will be approximately $394,467,000.
  During fiscal 1994, in connection with the Vintners
  Acquisition and the Almaden/Inglenook Acquisition, the Company
  established a reserve for the estimated loss on these firm purchase
  commitments of approximately $62,664,000.

  The Company's aggregate obligations under the grape crush and processing
  contracts will be approximately $5,503,000 over the remaining term
  of the contracts which expire through fiscal 1997.

  Currency  forward contracts -
  At August 31, 1994 and 1993, the Company had open currency forward
  contracts to purchase German deutsche  marks of $6,674,000 and $6,031,000
  respectively, and British pounds of $579,000 and $928,000, respectively,
<PAGE>

  all of which mature within 12 months; their fair market values, based
  upon August 31, 1994 and 1993 market exchange rates, were $7,382,000 and
  $6,262,000, respectively, for German deutsche marks and $614,000 and
  $929,000 respectively for British pounds.

  Employment contracts -
  The Company has employment contracts with certain of its executive
  officers and certain other management personnel with remaining terms
  ranging up to five years.  These agreements provide for minimum salaries,
  as adjusted for annual increases, and may include incentive bonuses based
  upon attainment of specified management goals.  In addition, these
  agreements also provide for severance payments in the event of specified
  terminations of employment.  The aggregate commitment for future compensation
  and
  severance, excluding incentive bonuses, was approximately $7,300,000
  as of August 31, 1994.

  Legal matters -
  The Company is subject to litigation from time to time in the ordinary
  course of business.  Although the amount of any liability with respect to
  such litigation cannot be determined, in the opinion of management, such
  liability will not have a material adverse effect on the Company's
  financial condition or results of operations.


  12.  SIGNIFICANT CUSTOMERS AND CONCENTRATION OF CREDIT RISK:

  The Company sells its products principally to wholesalers for resale to
  retail outlets including grocery stores, package liquor stores, club and
  discount stores and restaurants.  Gross sales to the five largest
  wholesalers of the Company represented 23.7%, 25.1% and 28.5% of the
  Company's gross sales for the fiscal years ended August 31, 1994, 1993
  and 1992, respectively.  Gross sales to the Company's largest wholesaler
  represented 12.3% of the Company's gross sales for the fiscal year ended
  August 31, 1994; no single wholesaler was responsible for greater than
  10% of gross sales during the fiscal years ended August 31, 1993 and
  1992.  Gross sales to the Company's five largest wholesalers are expected
  to continue to represent a significant portion of the Company's revenues. 
  The Company's arrangements with certain of its wholesalers may,
  generally, be terminated by either party with prior notice.  The Company
  performs ongoing credit evaluations of its customers' financial position,
  and management of the Company is of the opinion that any risk of
  significant loss is reduced due to the diversity of customers and
  geographic sales area.


  13.  THE RESTRUCTURING PLAN 

  In the fourth quarter, the Company provided for costs to restructure the
  operations of its California wineries (the Restructuring Plan).  Under
  the Restructuring Plan, all  bottling operations at the Central Cellars
  winery in Lodi, California and the branded wine bottling operations at
  the Monterey Cellars Winery in Gonzales, California will be moved to the
  Mission Bell Winery located in Madera, California which was acquired by
  the Company in the Almaden/Inglenoook Acquisition.  The Monterey Cellars
  Winery will continue to be used as a crushing, winemaking and contract
  bottling facility.  The Central Cellars Winery and the winery in Soledad,
  California will be closed and offered for sale
  to reduce surplus capacity.  The
<PAGE>

  Restructuring Plan reduced income before income taxes and net income by
  approximately $24,005,000 and $14,883,000, respectively or $.91 per
  share, on a fully diluted basis.  Of the total pretax charge,
  approximately $16,481,000 is to recognize estimated losses associated
  with the revaluation of land, buildings and equipment related to the
  facilities described above to their estimated net realizable value; and
  approximately  $7,524,000 relates to severance and other benefits
  associated with the elimination of 260 jobs.  The Restructuring Plan
  will require the Company to make capital expenditures of approximately
  $20,000,000 during fiscal 1995 to expand storage capacity and install
  certain relocated equipment.  As of August 31,1994, the Company has a
  remaining accrual of approximately $9,106,000 with respect to the
  Restructuring Plan.  The Company expects to have the Restructuring Plan
  fully implemented by the end of fiscal 1995.

      thereof shall have been applied pursuant to Section 2.11(d) hereof to
      the prepayment of Loans (and/or to provide cover for the Letter of
      Credit Liabilities) each of the respective amounts set forth above
      shall be adjusted by adding thereto an amount equal to the Net
      Available Proceeds in respect of such Equity Issuance (provided that,
      the aggregate amount of all such adjustments shall be no greater than
      $60,000,000) and (ii) upon the receipt by the Banks of the financial
      statements referred to in Section 9.01(i) hereof (so long as the
      amount determined pursuant to the succeeding clause (y) is greater
      than zero), each of the respective amounts set forth above shall be
      adjusted by subtracting therefrom an amount equal to the product of
      (x) .75 times (y) an amount equal to (A) Intangibles as reflected on
      the restated balance sheet of the Company and its Consolidated
      Subsidiaries dated as of the Effective Date delivered to the Banks
      pursuant to Section 9.01(i) hereof minus (B) $111,000,000."

      Section 3.  Miscellaneous.  Except as herein provided, the Credit
  Agreement shall remain unchanged and in full force and effect.  This
