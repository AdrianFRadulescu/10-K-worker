                                                          PART I

Item 1.           Business.

         Winthrop  Partners  81  Limited  Partnership  (the  "Partnership")  was
organized  under the Uniform  Limited  Partnership  Act of the  Commonwealth  of
Massachusetts  on  February  9, 1981,  for the  purpose  of owning  and  leasing
commercial  and  industrial  real  properties.  The  Partnership  was  initially
capitalized  with  contributions of $1,000 from each of the two General Partners
and  $5,000  from the  Initial  Limited  Partner.  On  February  26,  1981,  the
Partnership filed a Registration  Statement on Form S-11 with the Securities and
Exchange  Commission  (the  "Commission")  with respect to a public  offering of
70,000 Units of limited  partnership  interest  ("Units") at a purchase price of
$500 per Unit (an  aggregate of  $35,000,000).  The  Registration  Statement was
declared  effective on June 2, 1981.  The offering  terminated  in June 1982, at
which  time  25,099  Units,  representing  capital  contributions  from  Limited
Partners of $12,549,500, had been subscribed for.

         The Partnership's General Partners are One Winthrop Properties, Inc., a
Massachusetts   limited  partnership  (the  "Managing  General  Partner"),   and
Linnaeus-Hampshire   Realty  Limited   Partnership,   a  Massachusetts   limited
partnership (the "Associate  General  Partner").  One Winthrop is a wholly-owned
subsidiary  of  First  Winthrop  Corporation  ("First  Winthrop"),   a  Delaware
corporation which is wholly owned by Winthrop  Financial  Associates,  A Limited
Partnership  ("WFA"),  a Maryland  public  limited  partnership.  See "Change in
Control."

         The  Partnership's  only  business is owning and leasing  improved real
estate.  The Partnership's  investment  objectives and policies are described at
pages 17-24 of its Prospectus  dated June 2, 1981 (the  "Prospectus")  under the
caption  "Investment  Objectives  and Policies,"  which  description is attached
hereto as an exhibit and incorporated  herein by this reference.  The Prospectus
was filed with the Commission pursuant to Rule 424(b) on July 13, 1981.

     The  Partnership  has  invested  all of the  net  proceeds  of the  Limited
Partners' capital  contributions,  other than approximately  $165,000 originally
set aside as reserves,  in ten (10) real proper ties. The Partnership's  current
reserves net of accounts payable,  accrued expenses and distributions payable to
Partners of  approximately  $147,000 are  invested in money market  instruments.
Eight properties have been sold: one in 1989; one in 1991; three in 1992; two in
1993; and one in 1995. See "Dispositions", below. The




<PAGE>



Partnership's future cash distributions will include ongoing  distributions from
rental income and one-time distributions of sale proceeds. Rental income will be
affected by the terms of any new  leases,  any tenant  improvements  and leasing
costs  associated with renewing  leases with existing  tenants or signing leases
with new  tenants,  the loss of rent  during any period  when a property  is not
under lease and the loss of rent after a property is sold. Distributions of sale
proceeds  will  be  made  as a  partial  return  of  capital.  Pursuant  to  the
Partnership's  partnership  agreement,  the  cash to be  distributed  from  sale
proceeds will go 100% to limited  partners  until they have received  their $500
per unit original Capital  Contribution.  The general partners' 8% share of sale
proceeds would be paid subsequently.  See Item 2, "Properties" for a description
of the Partnership's remaining properties.

       The  Partnership  owns the fee interest in each of the two (2)  remaining
properties and acquired all of the properties  solely with  Partnership  capital
and without any mortgage  financing.  Each of these  properties is commercial in
nature and each is leased under a triple net lease to a single  tenant.  Each of
the  leases  is for an  initial  term of at least  five  years  from the date of
acquisition. Each of the tenants is a public company or a subsidiary of a public
company.

       The tenants  under each of the leases  have  exclusive  control  over the
day-to-day business operations  conducted at the Properties as well as decisions
with  respect  to  the  initiation  of any  development  or  renovations  at the
Properties. The Partnership has limited approval rights over any such renovation
programs proposed by the tenants.  The Partnership has no responsibility for any
maintenance,  repairs or improvements associated with any of the Properties.  In
addition,  the  tenants at the  Properties  are  responsible  for all  insurance
requirements  and the  payment  of real  estate  taxes  directly  to the  taxing
authorities.  The  Partnership  believes  that  the  Properties  are  adequately
insured.

       Each  tenant is subject to  competition  from  other  companies  offering
similar  products in the  locations of the property  leased by such tenant.  The
Partnership has no control over the tenants' responses to competitive conditions
impacting the businesses  operated by the tenants at each of the properties.  In
addition,  the  Partnership  will  be  subject  to  significant  competition  in
attracting  tenants upon the  expiration or  termination of either of the leases
with its tenants.

       Rents paid pursuant to the lease with GTE North  Incorporated and Frank's
Nursery  and  Crafts   (including   additional   percentage  rent)  account  for
approximately  68.4% and 31.6% of the Partnership's  revenues for 1995. See Item
2,   "Properties"   for  a  description  of  the  leases  with  respect  to  the
Partnership's two remaining properties.

Dispositions

       NCNB, Batesburg, SC. On March 12, 1993, the Partnership sold the property
to a third party. The sale price was $112,500 which is  significantly  less than
the  original  purchase  price of  $234,653.  Net  proceeds  from the sale  were
distributed to the limited partners with the 1993 First Quarter distribution. On
a per-unit basis, $4.48 was distributed as a return of capital. The cash-on-cash
return provided by the property during its holding period was approximately 4.4%
per annum, taking into account the quarterly  distributions  attributable to the
property and the loss of capital  incurred on sale. The  Partnership's  original
investment in this property represented  approximately 2.1% of the Partnership's
initial offering proceeds.

       NCNB, Orangeburg, SC. On July 30, 1993, the Partnership sold the property
to a third party.  The sale price was  $125,000  which is less than the original
purchase  price of $484,208.  Net proceeds of the sale were  distributed  to the
limited partners with the 1993 Third Quarter  Distribution.  On a per-unit basis
$4.56 was distributed as a return of capital.  The cash-on-cash  return provided
by the property during its original  holding period was  approximately  2.7% per
annum,  taking into  account the  quarterly  distributions  attributable  to the
property and the loss of capital  incurred on sale. The  Partnership's  original
investment in this property represented  approximately 4.3% of the Partnership's
initial offering proceeds.

       Seagate Technology  ("Seagate"),  formerly known as Magnetic Peripherals,
Oklahoma City, OK. On January 12, 1995, the  Partnership  sold the property to a
third party.  The sale price was  $3,100,000  (approximate  book value) which is
significantly less than the original purchase price of $5,554,285.  Net proceeds
from the sale will be distributed with the 1995 First Quarter distribution.  The
Partnership's original investment in the property represents approximately 49.3%
of the initial offering proceeds.

Employees

       The Partnership  does not have any employees.  Services are performed for
the  Partnership by its Managing  General  Partner,  and agents  retained by the
Managing  General  Partner,  including  an  affiliate  of the General  Partners,
Winthrop Management.

         Until  December  22,  1994,  the  sole  general   partner  of  Linnaeus
Associates Limited Partnership  ("Linnaeus"),  which is the sole general partner
of WFA, and the sole general partner of the Associate General Partner was Arthur
J.  Halleran,  Jr.. On December 22, 1994,  pursuant to an  Investment  Agreement
entered into among Nomura Asset Capital Corporation  ("NACC"),  Mr. Halleran and
certain  other  individuals  who  comprised  the senior  management  of WFA, the
general  partnership  interest in Linnaeus was transferred to W.L. Realty,  L.P.
("W.L.  Realty").  W.L. Realty is a Delaware  limited  partnership,  the general
partner  of  which  was,  until  July  18,  1995,  A.I.   Realty  Company,   LLC
("Realtyco"),  an entity owned by certain  employees  of NACC.  On July 18, 1995
Londonderry  Acquisition II Limited  Partnership  (Londonderry  II"), a Delaware
limited  partnership,  and  affiliate  of  Apollo  Real  Estate  Advisors,  L.P.
("Apollo"), acquired, among other things, Realtyco's general partner interest in
W.L. Realty and a sixty four percent (64%) limited partnership  interest in W.L.
Realty,  and WFA acquired the general partner interest in the Associate  General
Partner.

       As a result of the  foregoing  acquisitions,  Londonderry  II is the sole
general  partner of W.L.  Realty which is the sole general  partner of Linnaeus,
and  which in turn is the  sole  general  partner  of WFA.  As a  result  of the
foregoing,  effective  July 18,  1995,  Londonderry  II, an affiliate of Apollo,
became the controlling  entity of the Managing General Partner and the Associate
General  Partner.  In connection with the transfer of control,  the officers and
directors of One Winthrop  Financial  resigned and  Londonderry II appointed new
officers  and  directors.  See Item 10,  "Directors  and  Executive  Officers of
Registrant.

Item 7.       Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial
        Condition and Results of Operations.

Liquidity and Capital Resources


       The  Partnership  generates  revenues from rental income paid pursuant to
leases with tenants at the  Partnership's  properties  as its primary  source of
liquidity.  Pursuant to the terms of the leases, the tenants are responsible for
all operating  expenses with respect to the properties  including,  maintenance,
capital  improvements,  insurance  and  taxes.  See  "Item 2  Properties"  for a
description of these leases.

       At December 31, 1995, the  Partnership's  had  approximately  $234,000 in
cash and cash  equivalents,  an increase of $54,550 from December 31, 1994. This
increase was due to $2,882,613 of cash from investing  activities generated from
the sale of the Partnership's Oklahoma City property, which was partially offset
by a reduction in cash from  operating  activities  ($64,011) and an increase in
cash used in financing  activities  ($2,771,299).  Each of these  increases  and
decreases were primarily due to the sale of the Oklahoma City property.

       The  Partnership  requires  cash to pay  management  fees and general and
administrative  expenses.  The  Partnership's  rental  and  interest  income was
sufficient in 1995, and is expected to be sufficient in future years, to pay all
of these  amounts as well as to provide for cash  distributions  to the Partners
from operations.  The leases at the Partnership's remaining properties expire in
April 1997 and January  1998 at which time the  Partnership  will be required to
extend the leases, find new tenants or sell the properties.

Results of Operations

       Through 1995, the results of the  Partnership's  operations have differed
somewhat  from year to year  primarily  because of percentage  rental  payments,
periodic increased rental payments,  variations in interest income, decreases in
depreciation expense and sales of properties.  The Partnership's sole sources of
income are from rents  received and interest  earned on cash balances  which are
invested  in short  term  investments.  The lease  with  Frank's  Nursery at the
Columbus, Ohio property provides for

percentage  rental payments which occurred in the last five years. The lease for
the GTE North,  Incorporated  property provides for periodic increases in rental
payments.  The  Partnership's  depreciation  expense decreases over time because
both of the remaining  properties are depreciated on the component  method which
results in some of the  building  components  having  shorter  useful lives than
others. In 1995, income was significantly reduced due to the loss of income from
the  Seagate  property  which has been  vacant  since May 1,  1994.  The sale of
properties reduces the operating revenues in future years.

       Because of the net nature of the leases of the two remaining  properties,
inflation  and  changing  prices  have  not  yet  signifi  cantly  affected  the
Partnership's revenues and net income.

                             REPORT OF INDEPENDENT PUBLIC ACCOUNTANTS


TO WINTHROP PARTNERS 81 LIMITED PARTNERSHIP:

    We have  audited the  accompanying  balance  sheets of Winthrop  Partners 81
Limited  Partnership (a  Massachusetts  limited  partnership) as of December 31,
1995 and 1994 and the related statements of income, changes in partners' capital
and cash flows for each of the three  years in the  period  ended  December  31,
1995. These financial  statements are the responsibility of Winthrop Partners 81
Limited Partnership's management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on
these financial statements based on our audits.

         We conducted our audits in accordance with generally  accepted auditing
standards.  Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material
misstatement.  An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting
the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements.  An audit also includes
assessing the  accounting  principles  used and  significant  estimates  made by
management,  as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation.
We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.

     In our opinion,  the financial statements referred to above present fairly,
in all material respects, the financial position of Winthrop Partners 81 Limited
Partnership  as of December 31, 1995 and 1994 and the results of its  operations
and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended  December 31,
1995, in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles.

Our  audits  were  made for the  purpose  of  forming  an  opinion  on the basic
financial  statements taken as a whole.  Schedule III listed in Item 14(a)(2) is
the responsibility of Winthrop Partners 81 Limited Partnership management and is
presented  for  purposes  of  complying   with  the   Securities   and  Exchange
Commission's rules and is not a required part of the basic financial  statements
and, in our opinion,  is fairly stated, in all material respects,  the financial
data  required  to be set forth  therein  in  relation  to the  basic  financial
statements taken as a whole.

NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
December 31, 1995



1.      ORGANIZATION

        Winthrop  Partners  81  Limited  Partnership,  (the  Partnership),   was
        organized under the Uniform Limited  Partnership Act of the Commonwealth
        of  Massachusetts  on  February  9, 1981 for the  purpose  of owning and
        leasing commercial and industrial real properties.  The Partnership will
        terminate on December 31, 2009, or sooner,  in accordance with the terms
        of the Partnership Agreement.


2.      SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

        Financial  Statements - The financial  statements of the Partnership are
        prepared on the accrual basis of accounting in accordance with generally
        accepted accounting principles.

        Use of Estimates - The preparation of financial statements in conformity
        with generally accepted  accounting  principles  requires  management to
        make  estimates  and  assumptions  that affect the  reported  amounts of
        assets  and  liabilities   and  disclosure  of  contingent   assets  and
        liabilities  at the date of the  financial  statements  and the reported
        amounts of revenues and expenses  during the  reporting  period.  Actual
        results could differ from those estimates.

        Income  Taxes - No provision  has been made for federal,  state or local
        income taxes in the financial  statements of the  Partnership.  Partners
        are required to report on their  individual tax returns their  allocable
        share  of  income,   gains,  losses,   deductions  and  credits  of  the
        Partnership.  The  Partnership  prepares  its tax returns on the accrual
        basis.  On May 29, 1981,  the Internal  Revenue  Service issued a ruling
        that the  Partnership  will be classified  as a partnership  for federal
        income tax purposes.

        Distributions  to Partners - The cash  distribution due Partners for the
        three  months ended  December  31, 1995 is recorded in the  accompanying
        financial  statements  as a  liability  and  a  reduction  of  Partners'
        capital.   As  provided   in  the   Partnership   Agreement,   quarterly
        distributions  are payable to  Partners  within 60 days after the end of
        the quarter.

        Cash and Cash  Equivalents  - Cash and  cash  equivalents  consist  of a
        mutual fund that  invests in treasury  bills and  repurchase  agreements
        maturing  in three  months or less,  valued at cost  which  approximates
        market value.

        Percentage  Rent - The  Partnership has entered into several leases that
        provide  for a minimum  annual  rent plus  additional  rent  based  upon
        percentages  of  sales  at  the  properties   (percentage  rent).  These
        percentage  rents are  recorded  on a cash  basis.  For the years  ended
        December 31, 1995,  1994 and 1993, the Partnership  received  percentage
        rent totaling $5,284, $7,518 and $14,849, respectively.

        Leases - The  Partnership  leases its real  properties  and accounts for
        such leases in accordance  with the provisions of Statement of Financial
        Accounting  Standards No. 13, "Accounting for Leases," as amended.  This
        statement sets forth specific  criteria for determining  whether a lease
        should be accounted for as a financing lease or an operating lease.



<PAGE>



2.      SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (Continued)

               (a)  Financing Method

               Under this method, minimum lease payments to be received plus the
               estimated  value  of the  property  at the end of the  lease  are
               considered to be the Partnership's gross investment in the lease.
               Unearned  income,   representing  the  difference  between  gross
               investment and actual cost of the leased  property,  is amortized
               over the lease term using the interest rate implicit in the lease
               to provide a level rate of return over the lease term.

               (b)  Operating Method

               Under this method,  revenue is recognized as rentals  become due,
               which does not materially differ from the  straight-line  method.
               Expenses (including  depreciation) are charged to operations,  as
               incurred.

        Depreciation - Component  depreciation  on real estate leased to others,
        accounted  for  under  the  operating  method,  is  computed  using  the
        straight-line  method over the useful life of each class of asset, which
        ranges from 5 to 35 years.  The cost of the  properties  represents  the
        purchase price of the properties plus acquisition and closing costs.

        Certain  amounts  from  prior  years  have been  reclassified  to remain
        consistent with the current year presentation.

3.      TRANSACTIONS WITH RELATED PARTIES

        One Winthrop  Properties,  Inc.  (One  Winthrop),  the Managing  General
        Partner,  Winthrop  Securities  Co.,  Inc.  (Winthrop  Securities),  the
        Selling  Agent for the Public  Offering,  and Winthrop  Management,  the
        manager  of the  properties,  are  wholly  owned  subsidiaries  of First
        Winthrop  Corporation,  which  in  turn  is  wholly  owned  by  Winthrop
        Financial Associates, A Limited Partnership (WFA).

        Winthrop Management is entitled to annual property management fees equal
        to 1.5% of the excess of cash receipts over cash expenditures (excluding
        debt service,  property  management fees and capital  expenditures) from
        each property managed by it. For the years ended December 31, 1995, 1994
        and  1993,  Winthrop  Management  earned  $5,092,  $9,595  and  $12,821,
        respectively, for managing the real properties of the Partnership.

        The  General   Partners  are  entitled  to  8%  of  Cash  Available  for
        Distribution,   subordinated   to  a   cumulative   priority   quarterly
        distribution to the Limited  Partners as provided for in the Partnership
        Agreement.  The  General  Partners  are also  entitled  to 8% of Sale or
        Refinancing  Proceeds,  subordinated to certain priority distribution to
        the Limited Partners as provided for in the Partnership  Agreement.  For
        the year  ended  December  31,  1993,  the  Partnership  paid or accrued
        distributions  from Cash Available for Distribution  totaling $53,541 to
        the General  Partners.  No such  amounts were paid or accrued in 1995 or
        1994. The proceeds from the sale of the Orangeburg and Batesburg,  South
        Carolina properties in 1993, and the Seagate,  Oklahoma property in 1995
        (see Note 6) were distributed entirely to the Limited Partners.

        During the liquidation  stage of the  Partnership,  the General Partners
        and  their   affiliates  are  entitled  to  receive   certain  fees  and
        distributions,  subordinated to specified minimum returns to the Limited
        Partners as described in the Partnership Agreement.

6.      SALE OF PROPERTY

        On  July  30,  1993,  the  Partnership  sold  the  property  located  in
        Orangeburg,  South Carolina,  for a sale price of $125,000, and in March
        1993,  the  Partnership  sold the property  located in Batesburg,  South
        Carolina,  for a sale price of $112,500.  The  Partnership had accounted
        for the leased  properties  under the  operating  method and realized an
        aggregate  loss of $138,310 on these  transactions.  The sales  provided
        $227,153  of net  proceeds,  which  have  been  distributed  to  limited
        partners.

        On January  12,  1995,  the  Partnership  sold the  property  located in
        Oklahoma  City,  Oklahoma,  for a sale  price  of  $3,100,000.  The  net
        proceeds  received by the Partnership for the sale resulted in a gain of
        $11,173 for financing reporting  purposes.  The sale provided $2,882,613
        of net proceeds, which have been distributed to limited partners.

7.      TAXABLE INCOME

        The  Partnership's  taxable  income for 1995 differs from the net income
        for financial reporting purposes primarily due to the differences in the
        methods used for the recognition of depreciation  and the accounting for
        certain real property  leases under the  financing  method for financial
        reporting  purposes and the  operating  method for tax return  purposes.

       (f)    Involvement in Certain Legal Proceedings.   None.

Item 11.              Executive Compensation.

         Registrant is not required to and did not pay any
compensation to the officers or directors of the Managing General
Partner.  The Managing General Partner does not presently pay any
compensation to any of its officers or directors.  (See Item 13,
"Certain Relationships and Related Transactions.")

Item 12. Security Ownership of Certain Beneficial Owners and Management.

       (a) Security  ownership of certain  beneficial owners. No person or group
is known by the  Partnership to be the  beneficial  owner of more than 5% of the
outstanding Units at March 1, 1996.
 Under the Amended and Restated Agreement of (the "Partnership Agreement"),  the
voting  rights of the Limited  Partners are limited and, in some  circumstances,
are  subject to the prior  receipt of certain  opinions  of counsel or  judicial
decisions.

       Under the Partnership Agreement,  the right to manage the business of the
Partnership  is vested in the General  Partners and is generally to be exercised
only by the Managing General Part ner, One Winthrop  Properties,  Inc., although
the consent of the Associate General Partner,  Linnaeus-Hampshire Realty Limited
Partnership, is required for all purchases,  financings,  refinancings and sales
or other  dispositions of the Partnership's  real properties and with respect to
certain  other  matters.  See  Item 1 above  for a  description  of the  General
Partners.

       (b) Security ownership of management. None of the partners of WFA nor any
of the officers,  directors or the general partner of the General Partners owned
any Units at March 1,  1996.  A  wholly-owned  subsidiary  of WFA owns 200 Units
(less than 1% of the total number of Units outstanding).

       (c)  Changes  in  control.  There  exists  no  arrangement  known  to the
Partnership  the operation of which may at a subsequent  date result in a change
in control of the Partnership except as follows:

     In connection with its  acquisition of control of Linnaeus,  Londonderry II
issued  NACC a $22  million  non-recourse  purchase  money  note due  1998  (the
"Purchase Money Note"),  as set forth in a loan agreement,  dated as of July 14,
1995, by and between NACC and Londonderry II. Initial  security for the Purchase
Money Note  includes,  among other  things,  the  partnership  interests in W.L.
Realty  acquired by Londonderry II and the W.L. Realty  partnership  interest in
Linnaeus.  Accordingly, if Londonderry II does not satisfy its obligations under
the  Purchase  Money  Note,  NACC  would have the right to  foreclose  upon this
security and, as result, would gain control of the Registrant.

Item 13.  Certain Relationships and Related Transactions.

       Under  the  Partnership   Agreement,   the  General  Partners  and  their
affiliates   are  entitled  to  receive   various  fees,   commis  sions,   cash
distributions,  allocations of taxable income or loss and expense reimbursements
from the Partnership.

       Winthrop  Management is entitled to annual property management fees equal
to 1.5% of the excess of cash receipts over cash  expenditures  (excluding  debt
service,  property management fees and capital  expenditures) from each property
managed by it. For the years ended  December 31, 1995,  1994 and 1993,  Winthrop
Management  earned $5,092,  $9,595 and $12,821,  respectively,  for managing the
real properties of the Partnership.

       The  General   Partners  are  entitled  to  8%  of  Cash   Available  for
Distribution,  subordinated to a cumulative  priority quarterly  distribution to
the Limited Partners as provided for in the Partnership  Agreement.  The General
Partners are also entitled to 8% of Sale or Refinancing  Proceeds,  subordinated
to certain priority distributions to the Limited Partners as provided for in the
Partnership  Agreement.  For the years ended December 31, 1993, the  Partnership
paid or accrued  distributions  from Cash  Available for  Distribution  totaling
$53,541 to the General Partners. No such amounts were paid or accrued in 1995 or
1994. The proceeds from the sale of the Orangeburg and Batesburg, South Carolina
properties in 1993, and the Seagate,  Oklahoma property in 1995 were distributed
entirely to the Limited Partners.

       During the liquidation stage of the Partnership, the General Partners and
their  affiliates  are  entitled  to  receive  certain  fees and  distributions,
subordinated to specified  minimum returns to the Limited  Partners as described
in the Partnership Agreement.
