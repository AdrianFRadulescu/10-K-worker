Item 1.  BUSINESS

                  (a) GENERAL DEVELOPMENT OF BUSINESS. Uniflex, Inc. (a Delaware
corporation  organized  in 1973) is the  successor by merger to the business and
assets of Uniflex,  Inc. (a New York  corporation  organized in 1963).  Uniflex,
Inc., its predecessor and subsidiaries are hereinafter  collectively referred to
as the Registrant.  The Registrant designs,  manufactures and sells a variety of
plastic bags used in packaging,  promotion and retailing and has been so engaged
for more than the last five years.

                  In January  1996,  the  Registrant  formed  Uniflex  Southeast
L.L.C.,  a  Delaware  limited  liability  company  ("Southeast")  to market  and
distribute  health and safety products and services in the  southeastern  United
States.  Uniflex  Southeast,  Inc.,  a  Delaware  corporation  and  wholly-owned
subsidiary  of the  Registrant,  is the Manager of Southeast and owns 80% of its
equity. In March 1996, Southeast commenced operations in Roswell, Georgia.

                  In January  1995,  the  Registrant  formed  Uniflex  Southwest
L.L.C., a Delaware limited  liability  company  ("Southwest") to manufacture and
distribute  plastic packaging  material in the southwestern  United States.  The
Registrant  is the Manager of  Southwest  and owns 80% of its  equity.  In April
1995, Southwest commenced operations in Albuquerque, New Mexico.

                  In July 1993, the Registrant acquired certain of the assets of
Haran  Packaging  Co., Inc., a New York  corporation  engaged in the business of
manufacturing, distributing and selling packaging materials ("Haran").

                  The Registrant through Hantico,  Inc. (a Delaware  corporation
organized in December 1992)  ("Hantico"),  a wholly-owned  subsidiary,  produced
buttons, button products,


                                       -2-

<PAGE>
badges,  ribbons,  mirrors and magnets for the advertising specialty marketplace
from  December  1992 until January  1995.  Celluloid  political and  advertising
buttons  comprised  Hantico's major product line. In January 1995,  Hantico sold
substantially all of its assets to an unaffiliated third party.

                  (b)  FINANCIAL   INFORMATION  ABOUT  INDUSTRY  SEGMENTS.   Not
applicable.

                  (c) (1) NARRATIVE  DESCRIPTION  OF BUSINESS.  The  information
specified in paragraphs  (i)-(xiii)  below is included in  accordance  with Item
101(c)(1) of Regulation S-K.

                           (i) The Registrant's  principal product is a flexible
plastic bag with an attached plastic handle or other closure or carrying device,
known as a "specialty bag." The bag is made of polyethylene and comes in various
sizes.  The bag is printed  from  artwork  (e.g.,  the user's  product and logo)
prepared either by the  Registrant's  in-house art and production  department or
supplied to the  Registrant  by the user or its  advertising  agency.  Injection
molded rigid polyethylene  handles,  in various sizes and shapes,  with reusable
snap-closures,  are  affixed  to  the  bags  by a  heat-sealing  process.  Other
specialty  bags produced and marketed by the  Registrant  include  die-cut bags,
drawstring  bags and  litter  bags.  The  Registrant's  specialty  bags are used
primarily for promotional  purposes  including,  for example, at trade shows and
exhibitions.  The Registrant's specialty bags are sold and marketed primarily to
a network of promotional products distributors.

         The Registrant  also  manufactures  a line of specialized  bags used in
various  segments  of the  healthcare  industry  including  hospitals,  clinical
laboratories  and  radiology  departments.  For  this  industry  the  Registrant
manufactures a clear bag used as a secondary container for the safe transport of
clinical  laboratory  specimens,   under  the  trademark   "Speci-Gard(R)."  The
Registrant


                                       -3-
<PAGE>

markets this product  primarily to healthcare and laboratory  supply  companies.
The Registrant believes that the bag meets or exceeds OSHA standards. The bag is
a  liquid-tight,  disposable  specimen  transport  bag with a patented  one step
sealing system that is approved as a secondary container for specimen transport.
The registrant also manufactures and markets a clear,  radiolucent,  disposable,
protective cover for X-Ray cassettes under the trademark "Protex-Ray(TM)" to the
healthcare market.

         The Registrant also  manufactures and markets a variety of conventional
polyethylene bags without carrying  attachments,  many of which are also printed
from artwork, for use in packaging principally by various apparel and soft goods
manufacturers.  The Registrant also  manufactures  and markets  flexible plastic
envelopes with pressure  sensitive  adhesive closures for use in the air courier
industry as a document  handling pouch. The Registrant also sells molded plastic
handles for plastic bags to other manufacturers.

         The Registrant also  manufactures  and markets a highly  tamper-evident
cash handling bag under the trademarks  "Ultravault(TM)  and  Univault(TM)." The
disposable bags are constructed of high strength  polymer film,  provide thermal
protection from tampering,  and are constructed with the  Registrant's  patented
one step Press and Close(R) sealing system.  The Registrant markets the products
to  cash  intensive   businesses   including  financial   institutions,   retail
establishments  and fast food chains,  for the safe  transport of cash and other
valuables.

         The  Registrant,  through  Southwest,  produces and markets a soft loop
handle bag with  applications  ranging from retail  shopping  bags to functional
"pick it yourself" produce bags. Other products include a double drawstring bag,
which is marketed primarily to cosmetic related


                                       -4-
<PAGE>
firms  and  a  reclosable,  resealable,  Trac-Log  bag,  which  is  marketed  to
healthcare and laboratory supply companies, food packaging firms and promotional
products distributors.

         The  Registrant,  through  Southeast,  produces  and markets  infection
control products for the dental  industry,  including a transport bag for dental
impressions, antimicrobial soaps, and disinfectants.

                  The Registrant  continues to develop new products.  After more
than a year of research,  development and testing,  the Registrant,  in November
1994, began shipping its  Ultravault(TM)  "tamper  evident"  security bags which
provide the user with visual evidence of tampering with the bag's contents.  The
Ultravault(TM) "tamper evident" security bags are being introduced into markets,
such as banks,  retailers,  casino  operators,  stockbrokers  and courier firms,
which have security concerns for cash and other valuables.

         The  following  table sets forth the  amount  and  percentage  of sales
contributed  by each class of similar  products  for the last three fiscal years
which  contributed  fifteen percent or more of total sales in any of such fiscal
years.

</TABLE>

                  The Registrant  distributes  approximately 44% of its products
to  advertising  specialty  distributors  as part of its bag,  button and ribbon
advertising  program.  The  Registrant  distributes  approximately  21%  of  its
products, namely Speci-Gard(TM) and other hospital related


                                       -5-


<PAGE>

products,  to hospital  supply houses and directly to hospitals.  The Registrant
also sells its products to various distributors for resale. Less than 10% of the
Registrant's sales are directly with major retailers,  chain stores,  industrial
concerns and other large end-users.  The Registrant's  products are sold through
eighteen  salespeople  which  include  thirteen  salespeople  and  five  of  the
Registrant's  officers.  During the fiscal  year ended  January  31,  1996,  the
Registrant's sales staff accounted for approximately  ninety-eight percent (98%)
of sales  while  approximately  two  percent  (2%) of sales  were  made  through
manufacturer's representatives.

                  The  Registrant's  sales office,  including  its showroom,  is
located at its principal  executive offices in Hicksville,  New York (see Item 2
below).  During the fiscal year ended January 31, 1996, the Registrant  incurred
advertising  expenditures  of  approximately  $300,000.  The Registrant  mails a
complete  catalogue of its  merchandise,  updated  annually.  For the year ended
January 31, 1996, the Registrant mailed  approximately  90,000 catalogues.  This
program  develops  substantial  leads  for  the  Registrant.  In  addition,  the
Registrant  receives  unsolicited  inquiries,  referrals and leads from existing
customers,  which are actively  pursued by the  Registrant's  salespersons.  The
Registrant also displays its merchandise at various trade shows, such as premium
shows and  soft-goods  shows.  Additionally,  the  Registrant  mails a catalogue
designed  specifically  for hospital  supply houses and hospitals to promote its
Speci-Gard(TM) products and other hospital products.

                           (ii)  Not applicable.

                           (iii) The raw materials  essential to the business of
the  Registrant  (primarily  polyethylene  plastic) are readily  available.  The
Registrant's  products are  manufactured  principally  at the plant it leases in
Westbury, New York (see Item 2 below). The Registrant owns


                                       -6-
<PAGE>
the molds used in  producing  its handles,  and, in  addition,  owns [seven (7)]
injection  molding  machines  which  produce  all of its  requirements  for such
plastic handles.

                           (iv)  The  Registrant   has   registered   trademarks
protecting  its  logo  and the  names  "Uniflex(TM)",  "Texture-Flex(TM)",  "Jet
Pouch(TM)", "Tri-Flex(TM)",  "Speci-Gard(TM)",  "Hand-L-Bag(TM), Protex-Ray(TM),
"Slip-Free(TM)",  "Press and Close(TM)", "Special Air Tuff(TM)",  "Uni-Box(TM)",
"Micro-Tex(TM)",  "Opti-Pouch(TM)", "UF(TM)", "Econovault(TM)",  "Univault(TM)",
"Ultravault(TM)",   "Univault  and  Logo  Design(TM)",  "Bagvertising(TM)",  "UF
Line(TM)" and "The  Bagvertising  Company(TM)."  The name  "Uniflex(TM)" and the
Uniflex logo trademark are also  registered  with the U.S.  Patent and Trademark
Office. The Registrant markets certain of its products utilizing its trademarks.
The Registrant believes that the loss of one or more of its trademarks would not
materially adversely affect its business.

                           (v) The  Registrant's  business  is not  affected  by
seasonal trends, however,  approximately fifty percent to sixty percent of sales
are traditionally made during the second half of the fiscal year. This is due to
slightly higher demand during the late summer and fall seasons.

                           (vi) The Registrant's inventory consists primarily of
raw materials.  The Registrant maintains sufficient material on hand to expedite
orders and properly service its customers.

                           (vii)  The   Registrant   has   approximately   8,500
customers,  none of which  accounted  for more than ten  percent  (10%) of sales
during the fiscal year ended January 31, 1996.

                           (viii) As of January 31, 1996,  the  Registrant had a
$5,108,000  backlog of firm orders, all of which the Registrant expects to fill.
As of January 31, 1995, the Registrant had a $4,659,000  backlog of firm orders,
substantially all of which have been filled.

                           (ix)  Not applicable.

                           (x) The  plastic bag  industry is highly  competitive
and is  comprised  of many  concerns  making  products  similar  to those of the
Registrant.  A number of these  concerns are larger than the Registrant in terms
of total  assets,  personnel,  sales and  financial  resources.  The  Registrant
believes  that  competition  in the  industry is based upon  price,  service and
quality of product.

                           (xi) The Registrant did not expend  material  amounts
on Registrant  sponsored  research and development  during the last three fiscal
years.

                           (xii) In addition to the  disposal of waste  solvents
through an authorized waste disposer,  the Registrant monitors its approaches to
the  disposal of waste  solvents  in order to comply with the Federal  Clean Air
Act, the provisions of which restrict the emission of V.O.C.  (Volatile  Organic
Compounds).

                  The   Registrant,   with   the   assistance   of   independent
consultants,  constantly  monitors  compliance  with  Federal,  state  and local
environmental provisions. During fiscal 1996, the Registrant spent approximately
$25,000 on such  compliance  and estimates  that $25,000 will be expended in the
current fiscal year. The Registrant believes that such capital  expenditures are
not material to the operations of the Registrant.

                           (xiii)   The   Registrant   has   approximately   380
employees,   including  thirteen   salespersons  and  fourteen   officers.   The
Registrant's  factory  personnel are employed under  contracts with  Amalgamated
Union Local 5 expiring on January 31, 1998.

                  (d)   FINANCIAL   INFORMATION   ABOUT   FOREIGN  AND  DOMESTIC
OPERATIONS AND EXPORT SALES. Not applicable.

Item 2.  PROPERTIES.

                  The Registrant  owns a 44,255 square foot building at 383 West
John  Street,  Hicksville,  New York  11802,  which  serves as the  Registrant's
principal executive offices. The Registrant uses approximately 9,900 square feet
at this  property  for  executive  offices,  sales,  accounting,  computers  and
showroom space.  Approximately 34,400 square feet is used as warehouse space and
approximately  3,000  square feet has been rented to a tenant.  The  property is
encumbered by a mortgage in the principal amount outstanding at January 31, 1996
of $1,547,000.

                  The  Registrant  leases a  building  at 474  Grand  Boulevard,
Westbury, New York 11590, containing  approximately 72,000 square feet of space,
of  which   approximately   32,000   square  feet  are  used  for   warehousing,
approximately 24,000 square feet for manufacturing,  approximately 10,000 square
feet  for  shipping  and  receiving  and  approximately  6,000  square  feet for
executive and clerical offices. The expiration date of the Registrant's lease is
April 30, 2003.  During the fiscal year ended January 31, 1996,  the  Registrant
paid  approximately  $132,500 for the base annual  rental of said  premises.  In
addition, the Registrant pays the cost of real estate taxes, insurance and other
expenses of maintaining the building,  which expenses  amounted to approximately
$458,000 during the fiscal year ended January 31, 1996.

Item 3.  LEGAL PROCEEDINGS.

                  The   Registrant  is  not  a  party  to  any  material   legal
proceedings.

RESULTS OF OPERATIONS:

         SALES:

                  Sales for the years ended  January 31, 1996,  January 31, 1995
and  January  31,  1994,   were   $31,510,000,   $30,133,000   and   $25,660,000
respectively. Sales for the year ended January 31, 1996 increased $1,377,000, or
4.6%,  compared  to the  prior  year  as a  result  of  increased  sales  in all
divisions,  primarily from the Medical  Packaging  Division.  These results were
achieved  without  the  contribution  of  sales  from the  Registrant's  Hantico
subsidiary  which was sold in January 1995 and which  contributed  approximately
$1,500,000 to sales during the fiscal year ended January 31, 1995. Sales for the
year ended January 31, 1995,  increased  $4,473,000,  or 17.4%,  compared to the
prior year,  as a result of  increased  sales in all  divisions,  primarily  the
Medical Packaging and Haran Divisions.

         The  Registrant's  continued  efforts to market the  Medical  Packaging
Division's  products to the healthcare  industry resulted in the Medical Packing
Division accounting for 23% of the Registrant's total sales, or $7,261,000,  for
the fiscal year ended January 31, 1996.  During the year ended January 31, 1995,
the Registrant also began shipping its  Ultravault(TM)  tamper evident  security
bag,  which  provides the user with visual  evidence of tampering with the bag's
contents.

         COST AND EXPENSES:

         JANUARY 31, 1996

                  Cost of sales before  depreciation,  as a percentage of sales,
increased to 62.2% for the year ended  January 31,  1996,  compared to 60.7% for
the prior year.  This increase was due  primarily to continued  increases in the
cost of raw  materials,  some of which could not  immediately  be  reflected  in
increased product prices.  Raw material prices during the year ended January 31,
1996 stabilized by the Registrant's fiscal third quarter ended October 31, 1995.
The

                                      -14-


<PAGE>
Registrant's  Central Purchasing  Department,  however,  continued to enable the
Registrant  to  efficiently  manage  the flow of raw  materials  and  long-range
purchasing commitments enabled the Registrant to anticipate certain increases.

                  Shipping, selling, general and administrative expenses for the
year ended January 31, 1996, decreased approximately $350,000, or 3.9%, compared
to the prior year.  This  decrease was due  primarily to decreases in insurance,
freight out and  environmental  expenses.  For the year ended  January 31, 1996,
other expenses increased from $401,000 to $413,000, or 3%, a nominal increase.

                  Interest expense for the year ended January 31, 1996 increased
$3,000,  or less than 1%,  compared  to the year ended  January 31,  1995.  This
increase was  attributable  to a nominal  increase in borrowings at the start of
the Registrant's 1996 fiscal year due to the start up of Southwest.

         JANUARY 31, 1995

                  Cost of sales before  depreciation,  as a percentage of sales,
increased to 60.7% for the year ended  January 31,  1995,  compared to 60.4% for
the prior year. This nominal  increase was due to large increases in the cost of
raw  materials,  some of which could not  immediately  be reflected in increased
product prices until the Registrant's  new catalog was prepared and mailed.  Raw
material  prices during the year ended January 31, 1995 increased  approximately
50% compared to the prior  fiscal  year.  The  Registrant's  Central  Purchasing
Department,  however,  enabled the Registrant to efficiently  manage the flow of
raw materials and long-range  purchasing  commitments  enabled the Registrant to
anticipate certain increases. In addition, prompt payment by the Registrant, for
raw materials, at a discount, aided in moderating the effect of these increases.

                  Shipping, selling, general and administrative expenses for the
year ended  January 31,  1995,  increased  approximately  $1,504,000,  or 20.6%,
compared to the prior year.  This  increase was due to increases in  commissions
and selling  expenses  directly  related to the increase in sales.  For the year
ended January 31, 1995, other expenses  decreased from $648,000 to $401,000,  or
38%, as a direct  result of the gain from the sale of the  Registrant's  Hantico
Division and a reduction in deferred compensation expense as a result of changes
in actuarial assumptions.

                  Interest expense for the year ended January 31, 1995 increased
$35,000, or 9.2%, compared to the year ended January 31, 1994. This increase was
attributable  to  increases in the  interest  rate  charged by the  Registrant's
lender and a nominal increase in borrowings.

         INCOME BEFORE PROVISION FOR INCOME TAXES:

                  Income  before  provision  for income taxes for the year ended
January 31, 1996, increased  approximately  $374,000, or 19.2%, to approximately
$2,317,000 compared to approximately $1,943,000 for year ended January 31, 1995.
This  increase  was  primarily   attributable  to  increased  sales,   continued
improvements in manufacturing  operations and a reduction in shipping,  selling,
general and  administrative  expenses.  Income before provision for income taxes
for the year ended January 31, 1996 would have been $150,000 greater without the
start up costs associated with Southwest.

                  Income  before  provision  for income taxes for the year ended
January 31, 1995,  increased  approximately  $424,000,  or 28%, to approximately
$1,943,000  compared to approximately  $1,519,000 for the year ended January 31,
1994.  This increase was primarily  attributable  to the 17.4% increase in sales
without a corresponding increase in operating expenses.

                  Provision  for  income  taxes for the year ended  January  31,
1996, was $858,000  compared to $777,000 for the prior year primarily due to the
increase of $374,000 in income before provision for income taxes.

                  Provision  for  income  taxes for the year ended  January  31,
1995, was $777,000 compared to $541,000 for the prior year.  Utilizing  standard
federal and state tax rates,  $183,000 of the increase was directly attributable
to the increase of $424,000 in income  before  provision  for income  taxes.  In
addition,  during the year ended January 31, 1994, the Registrant  recognized an
$84,000  credit to the  provision  for income taxes as a result of a decrease in
the valuation allowance against its deferred tax assets.

         LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL COMMITMENTS:

                  Working  capital for the fiscal year ended  January 31,  1996,
increased to  $6,699,000  from  $5,822,000  for the year ended January 31, 1995.
This  increase of $877,000,  or 15.1%,  was directly  attributable  to operating
activities during fiscal 1996. This increase resulted in a working capital ratio
of 3.9 to 1 as January 31, 1996.

         On April 24, 1995, the Registrant  entered into a new revolving  credit
facility establishing a three-year  $4,000,000 facility.  Proceeds of the credit
facility were used for the repayment of indebtedness, permitted acquisitions and
working capital.  The credit agreement contains financial covenants relating to,
among other things, capital expenditures, minimum debt service coverage, minimum
working  capital,  minimum  tangible net worth,  the ratio of current  assets to
current  liabilities  and the ratio of total  liabilities to tangible net worth.
Borrowings  under the credit  facility will bear interest,  at the  Registrant's
option,  either at the bank's prime rate or at a rate 1-1/2% per annum in excess
of LIBOR (London Interbank  Offered Rate).  During the course of the fiscal year
ended January 31, 1996, the Registrant periodically reduced its debt and on

February  13,  1996  repaid  its  indebtedness  under the credit  facility.  The
Registrant  has unused lines of credit under its  revolving  credit  facility of
$4,000,000.  The Registrant  believes that it has sufficient working capital and
unused  lines of credit to meet its  expected  liquidity  and  capital  resource
requirements for the foreseeable future and to fund potential acquisitions.  The
Registrant  currently has budgeted  $500,000 for capital  improvements in fiscal
1996.

                  In December 1990,  the Financial  Accounting  Standards  Board
("FASB") issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 106, "Employers'
Accounting for  Postretirement  Benefits Other than Pensions" ("SFAS 106"). SFAS
106 requires that a company  recognize  costs currently that will be incurred in
the  future  relating  to  medical  and  other  benefits  to be  provided  after
retirement.  SFAS 106 was  implemented for the  Registrant's  fiscal year ending
January 31, 1994, and in the opinion of management, the adoption of SFAS 106 was
not material to the financial condition of the Registrant.

                  In  February   1992,   FASB  issued   Statement  of  Financial
Accounting  Standards  No. 109,  "Accounting  for Income  Taxes"  ("SFAS  109").
Companies are required to adopt SFAS 109 for years  beginning after December 15,
1992.  SFAS 109  requires  that  deferred  income  taxes be  recorded  using the
liability  method and restricts the conditions  under which a deferred asset may
be recorded.  The  Registrant is given the choice of reflecting  the adoption of
SFAS 109 in the year of change or  restating  any  number  of prior  years.  The
Registrant  adopted  SFAS 109 as of  February  1, 1993,  and,  in the opinion of
management,  its adoption had no material  effect on the financial  condition of
the Registrant. Item 8. FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND SUPPLEMENTARY DATA.

                          INDEPENDENT AUDITORS' REPORT

TO THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS AND STOCKHOLDERS
UNIFLEX, INC.

We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheet of Uniflex, Inc. and
Subsidiaries as of January 31, 1996 and the related  consolidated  statements of
income,  changes in stockholders' equity and cash flows for the year then ended.
These consolidated  financial statements are the responsibility of the Company's
management.  Our  responsibility is to express an opinion on these  consolidated
financial statements based on our audit.

We conducted our audit in accordance with generally accepted auditing standards.
Those standards  require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable
assurance  about  whether  the  consolidated  financial  statements  are free of
material  misstatement.  An audit includes examining,  on a test basis, evidence
supporting the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements.
An audit also includes assessing the accounting  principles used and significant
estimates  made by  management,  as well as  evaluating  the  overall  financial
statement  presentation.  We believe that our audit provides a reasonable  basis
for our opinion.

In our opinion, the consolidated  financial statements referred to above present
fairly, in all material respects,  the financial  position of Uniflex,  Inc. and
Subsidiaries  as of January 31, 1996,  and the results of their  operations  and
their  cash  flows for the year ended  January  31,  1996,  in  conformity  with
generally accepted accounting principles.

Our  audit  was  made  for the  purpose  of  forming  an  opinion  on the  basic
consolidated financial statements taken as a whole. The schedules listed in Item
14(a)(2)  are  presented  for  purposes of  complying  with the  Securities  and
Exchange Commission's rules and are not part of the basic consolidated financial
statements.  These  schedules  have been  subjected to the  auditing  procedures
applied in the audit of the basic consolidated  financial statements and, in our

TO THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS AND STOCKHOLDERS
UNIFLEX, INC.
HICKSVILLE, N.Y.

We have audited the accompanying  consolidated  balance sheets of Uniflex,  Inc.
and Subsidiaries as of January 31, 1995, and the related consolidated statements
of income,  changes in  stockholders'  equity and cash flows for each of the two
years in the  period  ended  January  31,  1995.  These  consolidated  financial
statements   are  the   responsibility   of  the   Company's   management.   Our
responsibility  is  to  express  an  opinion  on  these  consolidated  financial
statements based on our audits.

We  conducted  our  audits  in  accordance  with  generally   accepted  auditing
standards.  Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
reasonable  assurance about whether the  consolidated  financial  statements are
free of material  misstatement.  An audit includes  examining,  on a test basis,
evidence  supporting the amounts and disclosures in the  consolidated  financial
statements.  An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and
significant  estimates  made by  management,  as well as evaluating  the overall
financial  statement  presentation.   We  believe  that  our  audits  provide  a
reasonable basis for our opinion.

In our opinion, the consolidated  financial statements referred to above present
fairly, in all material respects,  the financial  position of Uniflex,  Inc. and
Subsidiaries  as of January 31, 1995,  and the results of their  operations  and
their cash flows for each of the two years in the period ended January 31, 1995,
in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles.

Our  audits  were  made for the  purpose  of  forming  an  opinion  on the basic
consolidated financial statements taken as a whole. The schedules listed in Item
14(a)(2)  are  presented  for  purposes of  complying  with the  Securities  and

applied in the audit of the basic consolidated  financial statements and, in our
opinion,  fairly state, in all material respects, the financial data required to
be set forth therein in relation to the basic consolidated  financial statements
taken as a whole.

                         UNIFLEX, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES
                   NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS


NOTE 1.  SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES:

DESCRIPTION OF BUSINESS AND CONCENTRATION OF CREDIT RISK:

Uniflex,  Inc.  (the  "Company")  designs,  manufactures  and sells a variety of
plastic  bags,  used  in  packaging,   promotion  and  retailing,  primarily  to
advertising  specialty  distributors,  hospitals or hospital  supply  houses and
major retailers.  One of its subsidiaries (which was disposed of as discussed in
Note 2) also produced buttons,  button products,  badges,  ribbons,  mirrors and
magnets for the advertising  specialty  marketplace,  which did not constitute a
reportable  business  segment.  The Company  extends credit to its customers and
historically has not experienced  significant losses related to receivables from
individual  customers  or groups of  customers  in any  particular  industry  or
geographic area.

PRINCIPLES OF CONSOLIDATION:

The consolidated  financial  statements  include the accounts of the Company and
its  wholly-owned  subsidiary  Hantico,  Inc.  (currently  inactive  -  Note  2)
organized  in  December  1992,  an 80%  interest  in Uniflex  Southwest  L.L.C.,
organized  in January  1995,  and an 80% interest in Uniflex  Southeast  L.L.C.,
organized  in January  1996 and  inactive  until  March 1996.  All  intercompany
accounts and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation.

CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS:

The Company  considers  cash and cash  equivalents to include highly liquid debt
instruments  purchased  with a maturity of three months or less. At times,  such
investments may be in excess of federal insurance limits.

INVENTORY:

Inventory is valued at the lower of cost or market.  Cost is  determined  by the
first-in, first-out method.

PROPERTY AND EQUIPMENT:

Property  and  equipment is stated at cost.  Depreciation  and  amortization  is
provided on the  straight-line  method over the  estimated  useful  lives of the
assets or, in the case of leasehold improvements, over the life of the lease, if
shorter.

The Company  constructs  certain  machinery  and equipment for its own use. When
completed,  the  material,  labor and other costs  related to  construction  are
capitalized and depreciated over the estimated useful life of the asset.

                   NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS


NOTE 1.  SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (CONT'D.):

INTANGIBLE ASSETS:

Intangible  assets consist primarily of patent costs, a covenant not to compete,
deferred  loan  acquisition  costs,  and a customer  list.  The values are being
amortized,  on a straight-line basis over the period of expected benefit ranging
from four to five years.  Accumulated  amortization at January 31, 1996 and 1995
was $160,872 and $95,610, respectively.

DEFERRED RENT:

Deferred  rent payable  represents  the excess of  recognized  rent expense over
scheduled lease payments, which will be credited to future operations.

DEFERRED INCOME TAXES:

Effective   February  1,  1993,  the  Company  adopted  Statement  of  Financial
Accounting  Standards No. 109 (SFAS 109),  "Accounting  for Income Taxes," which
requires the use of the  liability  method of accounting  for income taxes.  The
liability method measures  deferred income taxes by applying  enacted  statutory
rates in effect at the  balance  sheet date to the  differences  between the tax
basis of assets and  liabilities  and their  reported  amounts in the  financial
statements. The resulting deferred tax asset or liability is adjusted to reflect
changes in tax laws as they  occur.  The  Company's  adoption of SFAS 109 had no
material effect on the consolidated financial statements.

EARNINGS PER SHARE:

Computation  of earnings  per share is based on the weighted  average  number of
shares actually  outstanding plus the shares that would be outstanding  assuming
the exercise of dilutive stock options, all of which are considered to be common
stock  equivalents.  Common  stock  equivalents  were  calculated  by use of the
treasury stock method. The number of shares used in the computations of earnings
per share were  2,745,868;  2,719,114;  and  2,695,154  in 1996,  1995 and 1994,
respectively, after giving effect to stock splits (Note 8).

REVENUE RECOGNITION:

Revenue is recognized when orders are shipped.

USE OF ESTIMATES:

The preparation of financial  statements in conformity  with generally  accepted
accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that
affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue and expenses. Actual
results could differ from those estimates.

NOTE 1.  SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (CONT'D.):

ADVERTISING COSTS:

Advertising  costs are charged to  operations  as  incurred.  Catalog  costs are
accounted for as a prepaid expense and are amortized over a twelve month period.
Advertising  expenses  inclusive of catalog costs charged to operations  for the
year ended January 31, 1996, 1995 and 1994 were approximately $294,000, $357,000

balance of $102,000 was evidenced by a note payable without  interest.  The note
was paid in June 1993.

On January 12,  1995,  Hantico,  Inc.  sold its existing  inventory,  machinery,
equipment,  furniture and its customer  lists,  trademarks  and tradenames for a
purchase price of $221,000, resulting in a gain of $59,240.

On July 16, 1993, the Company  purchased the customer list and certain machinery
and equipment of Haran  Packaging,  Inc. for $158,000.  The Company paid $33,000
cash and issued  notes,  bearing  interest at the rate of 4% per annum,  for the
remaining  balance of  $125,000.  The notes were paid in full as of January  31,
1996.

Concurrently,  the stockholder of Haran Packaging,  Inc. entered into a $158,625
four year covenant not to compete  agreement with the Company.  The Company paid
$45,000 in cash,  issued a note payable for $23,000 and issued  12,500 shares of
restricted  common  stock at fair  market  value for the  balance.  The note and
interest, payable at 4% per annum, were paid December 31, 1993.

The  customer  list  and  covenant  not to  compete  are  being  amortized  on a
straight-line basis over two and four years, respectively.  Amortization expense

NOTE 8.  CAPITAL STOCK:

On October 30,  1992,  and again on December 17,  1993,  the Company  effected a
two-for-one  stock split recorded in the form of a stock dividend.  As a result,
common stock was  increased  by $55,442 and $113,284 in the years ended  January
31, 1993 and 1994, respectively, and additional paid-in capital was decreased by
the same amount. All references in the accompanying  financial statements to the
number of common  shares and per share amounts have been restated to reflect the
stock dividends.

On December 21, 1990,  the Company  entered into an agreement  whereby it issued
180,000 shares of common stock to an officer of the Company for consideration of
$1.13 per share  ($202,500).  Payment for the stock  consisted of $4,500 in cash
and the  issuance  of a note in the amount of  $198,000  payable in seven  equal
annual  principal  installments  (plus  interest  at  8.66  percent)  commencing
February 1991. Each annual installment, including interest, is to be forgiven by
the Company as additional  compensation  provided that the officer  fulfills the
terms of his employment agreement through January 1997. The transaction has been
recorded as a sale of stock with the note receivable reflected as a reduction of
stockholders'  equity.  For each of the years ended  January 31, 1996,  1995 and
1994,  approximately  $28,000,  net of  interest,  was  charged to  compensation
expense to reflect the forgiveness of the annual installments.

In January  1995 the  Company  acquired an 80%  interest  in Uniflex  Southwest,
L.L.C.  ("Southwest")  for  $600,000 in cash.  Additionally,  a minority  member
purchased a 20% interest in Southwest for $27,500 in cash, and equipment  having
a fair market value of $165,000.

quarters.  All net income  reported by  Southwest  will be allocated to Uniflex,
Inc.  until the  cumulative  net income  allocated to Uniflex,  Inc.  equals the
cumulative net losses  previously  allocated to Uniflex,  Inc.  Afterwards,  net
income and losses will be allocated 45% to Uniflex, Inc. and 55% to the minority
member.  The minority member shall contribute 60% of its allocated net income to
Southwest,  receiving an additional 1% ownership for each $7,500 it contributes.
When the minority member's ownership interest reaches 49%, net income losses and
will be allocated in relation to the members' ownership interest in Southwest.

an employee who,  prior to the granting of the option,  owns stock  representing
more than 10% of the voting  rights for which the exercise  price can be no less
than 110% of the fair market value of the Company's  common stock at the date of
grant.  The Plan is administered  by the Stock Option  Committee of the Board of
Directors.  The Committee  determines  when the options are  exercisable and the
term of the option, up to ten years. Options to purchase 66,800 shares have been
granted under the Plan at prices ranging from $2.13 to $7.25.

The Company has granted a third party the option to purchase  120,000  shares of
the  Company's  common  stock at a price of $1.63 per  share.  The  options  are

NOTE 13.  DEFERRED COMPENSATION PLANS AND POSTRETIREMENT MEDICAL
           BENEFITS

DEFERRED COMPENSATION PLAN:

On August 31, 1990, the Company  entered into deferred  compensation  agreements
with three key employees who retired on various dates through December 31, 1994.
These  agreements  provide for annual  payments of $100,000 to each employee for
life and $75,000  annually to their  beneficiary or estate for three years after
death,  with payments to commence  seven years after  retirement.  Each employee
simultaneously entered into seven year consulting and non-competition agreements
which will commence  upon  retirement  and which will pay the  employees  annual
payments of $75,000 for non-competition and $25,000 for consulting. In the event
of the  death  of any  of  the  employees  after  retirement  but  prior  to the
commencement of the deferred compensation agreement, the Company's obligation to
make future payments under these agreements will terminate.

The present value of the deferred compensation agreements,  calculated as of the
employees'  retirement dates and based upon their  respective life  expectancies
totals approximately  $960,000.  For each employee,  the Company is recording as
deferred  expense an amount equal to an annuity  deposit  necessary to yield the
present  values of the deferred  compensation  agreements  as of the  retirement
dates. Additionally, monthly charges of interest expense are being recorded such
that the deferred  compensation  payable will increase to the necessary level to
meet expected future payments.

The total  deferred  compensation  charged to  operations  relating to the years
ended January 31, 1996, 1995 and 1994 approximated $-0-, $70,000,  and $163,000,
respectively. Related interest expense charged to operations for the years ended
January 31,  1996,  1995 and 1994  approximated  $110,000,  $90,000 and $80,000,
respectively.

Deferred  compensation  payable at January 31, 1996 and 1995 was  $1,086,463 and
$976,872, respectively.

NOTE 13.  DEFERRED COMPENSATION PLANS AND POSTRETIREMENT
           MEDICAL BENEFITS (CONT'D)

POSTRETIREMENT MEDICAL BENEFITS:

The  deferred  compensation  agreements  require the Company to pay a portion of
each employee's health insurance  premiums from the date of retirement to death.
Effective   February  1,  1993,  the  Company  adopted  Statement  of  Financial
Accounting   Standards   No.  106  (SFAS   106),   Employer's   Accounting   for
Postretirement  Benefits  Other Than  Pension,"  which  requires  the Company to
recognize  the cost of providing  postretirement  benefits  over the  employees'
service periods.

The net periodic  postretirement  benefit  cost for the years ended  January 31,
1996, 1995 and 1994 was approximately  $-0-, $22,000 and $22,000,  respectively.
Related  interest  expense charged to operations for the years ended January 31,
1996,   1995  and  1994  was   approximately   $10,000,   $11,000  and  $11,000,
respectively.

The recorded liabilities for these postretirement  benefits,  none of which have
been funded, are as follows:

through  January  31,  2001.  The  Old  Employment  Agreement  shall  be  deemed
terminated and of no further force or effect as of January 31, 1996.

                     (b) The  Employee,  at his option,  shall have the right to
extend the Term of this Agreement for two (2) additional  two-year  periods (the
"First  Option"  and "Second  Option,"  respectively)  by written  notice to the
Corporation no more than


                                       -7-
<PAGE>
one  hundred  twenty  (120) days and no less than  ninety (90) days prior to the
expiration of this Term of this Agreement (or the term of the First Option),  as
the case may be.  All of the terms and  conditions  of this  Agreement  shall be
applicable during the period of the First Option and Second Option.

                  4. (a) This Agreement  (except as otherwise  provided  herein)
and the employment of the Employee hereunder shall terminate:

                         (i) automatically upon the death of the Employee;

                         (ii) at the  option of the  Corporation,  upon  written
notice  thereof to the  Employee,  in the event that the  Employee  shall become
permanently incapacitated (as hereinafter defined); and

                         (iii) at the option of the  Corporation,  upon 30 days'
prior written  notice thereof to the Employee  specifying the basis thereof,  in
the event of a material  breach by the Employee of any of the provisions of this
Agreement  which are not cured by the Employee within thirty (30) days after the
Employee is provided with such written notice, or in the event that the Employee
shall,  during  the  Term of this  Agreement,  engage  in any  criminal  conduct
constituting a felony and criminal charges are brought against the Employee by a
governmental  authority,  or, in the  determination of the Board of Directors of
the  Corporation,  be guilty of willful  malfeasance or gross  negligence  which
would


                                       -8-
<PAGE>
tend to materially and adversely affect the business of the Corporation.

                     (b) For purposes of this  Agreement,  the Employee shall be
deemed permanently incapacitated in the event that the Employee shall, by reason
of his  physical  or  mental  disability,  fail to fully  perform  his usual and
regular  duties for the  Corporation  for a  consecutive  period of twelve  (12)
months or for twelve (12) months in the  aggregate  in any  eighteen  (18) month
period;  provided,  however,  that the Employee shall not be deemed  permanently
incapacitated  unless and until a physician,  duly licensed to practice medicine
and reasonably acceptable to the Corporation and the Employee,  shall certify in
writing to the Corporation that the nature of the Employee's  disability is such
that it will continue as a substantial  impediment to the Employee's  ability to
perform his duties hereunder.

                  5. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein:

                     (a) In the event  that the  Employee  shall die  during the
term of this Agreement, the Corporation shall, in lieu of any other compensation
payable  hereunder,  pay  (i) to the  beneficiaries  theretofore  designated  in
writing by the Employee (or to the  Employee's  estate if no such  beneficiaries
have been  designated),  a sum equal to (A) $250,000 of the proceeds of the life
insurance  policy number 1073579 with Security Mutual Life Insurance of New York
maintained by the Corporation on the Employee's life, to be paid within ten (10)
days of the receipt


                                       -9-
<PAGE>
of the insurance proceeds and (B) the total compensation of any kind paid to the
Employee  pursuant to paragraph 2(a) during the  Corporation's  last fiscal year
prior to the death of the Employee in sixty (60) equal monthly installments with
the first  such  installment  to be paid on the first  day of the  second  month
following the date of death and the remaining installments to be paid on each of
the following  fifty-nine (59) monthly  anniversary dates of such first payment;
and (ii) to the  Employee's  estate,  all sums payable to the Employee as of the
date of death (and not theretofore  paid) and any and all other sums owed by the
Corporation to the Employee as of the date of death and not theretofore paid.

                     (b)  In  the  event   that  the   Employee   shall   become
incapacitated, then for the period prior to any termination of his employment in
accordance with paragraph  4(a)(iii) above, as a result of the Employee becoming
permanently  incapacitated,  the Employee  shall continue to receive one hundred
percent  (100%) of his  regular  compensation  herein  provided  in  Paragraph 2
attributable to such period prior to any termination of his employment.

                     (c) In the event that the  employment of the Employee shall
be  terminated  by reason  of his  permanent  incapacity,  then,  as  additional
consideration  for his past services to the Corporation,  he shall receive a sum
equal to the total  compensation  of any kind paid to the  Employee  pursuant to
paragraph 2(a) during the Corporation's last fiscal year prior to


                                      -10-
<PAGE>

the  termination of employment of the Employee,  in equal monthly  installments,
for a period of twenty-four (24) months from the date of such termination.

                     (d)  In  the  event  of a  termination  of  the  Employee's
employment  pursuant to paragraph  4(a)(iii)  above,  the Employee  shall not be
entitled to any payments other than such  compensation as shall have been earned
by him prior to the occurrence of the event giving rise to the  termination  and
not paid as of the date of such termination.

                     (e) In the event that the Corporation  shall desire to fund
the death benefits  payable under paragraph 5(a) above with a policy or policies
of  insurance  on the life of the Employee or the  disability  benefits  payable
under  paragraphs  5(b) and 5(c) above with a  disability  policy,  the Employee
shall cooperate with the Corporation in obtaining such insurance policy(ies) and
shall submit to such medical  examinations  and execute such documents as may be
required in connection with the obtaining of such insurance.

                     (f) The Employee may  terminate  this  Agreement  for "Good
Reason." For purposes of this  Agreement,  "Good Reason"  shall mean,  that if a
Change in Control (as hereinafter defined) has occurred, a determination is made
by the Employee,  in writing  (which  written notice shall specify in detail the
full facts and circumstances thereof), that as a result of the Change in Control
and a change in circumstances  thereafter affecting his position,  the Employee,
in his sole discretion (exercised in good faith),


                                      -11-

<PAGE>
determines that (x) he is unable to exercise the authorities,  functions, duties
or  responsibilities  of the  positions  for which he is hereby  employed or (y)
there is otherwise a material change in the nature or scope of the  authorities,
functions,  duties or responsibilities of the positions in which the Employee is
hereby  employed,  either of which  situation is not remedied within thirty (30)
days after  receipt by the  Corporation  of written  notice from the Employee of
such determination.

                  In the event the  Employee  exercises  his  rights  under this
paragraph  5(f),  he shall be  entitled  to a lump sum  amount  (the  "Severance
Payment")  equal  to  the  product  of  2.99  times  the  average  total  annual
compensation  of any kind paid to the  Employee  by the  Corporation  during the
Corporation's  last five full fiscal years prior to the date of  termination  of
employment.  The Severance Payment earned in accordance with this paragraph 5(f)
shall be paid to Employee  within five (5) days after the date of termination of
Employee's  employment  (hereinafter  referred to as the "Termination Date") and
all  other  amounts,  if any,  to be paid to  Employee  pursuant  to a Change of
Control  shall  also be paid by the  Corporation  within  five  (5)  days of the
Termination Date  (hereinafter  referred to as the "Payment  Date"),  unless the
applicable  plan or  document  governing  the  other  amounts,  if  any,  states
otherwise.  In addition,  all stock options the Employee holds shall vest upon a
Change of Control and the provisions of paragraph 7 of this  Agreement  shall be
null and void as of the date of termination of employment.


                                      -12-

<PAGE>
                     (g) For  the  purposes  of this  Agreement,  a  "Change  in
Control"  shall be deemed to have  occurred  upon the  occurrence  of any of the
following:  (i) the acquisition of the  "beneficial  ownership," as such term is
defined in Rule 13d-3 promulgated under the Securities  Exchange Act of 1934 (as
amended, the "1934 Act"), from and after the date of this Agreement, directly or
indirectly, of 20% or more of the outstanding voting stock of the Corporation or
any parent corporation of the Corporation by one or more "persons" (as such term
is used in Sections 13(d) and 14(d)(2) of the 1934 Act), whether or not any such
persons are affiliated or acting  individually  or as a group and whether or not
any such acquisition  occurs as a result of one or more transactions  (which may
or may not occur at the same time),  by any person who did not own,  directly or
indirectly, 20% of more of the outstanding voting stock of the Corporation as of
the date of this Agreement,  (ii) if all or substantially all of the business of
the  Corporation  is disposed  of  pursuant  to a transfer of the  Corporation's
assets to any person,  (iii) a merger,  consolidation  or other  transaction  in
which the Corporation is not the surviving corporation,  (iv) if the Corporation
is materially or completely liquidated,  or (v) a change in the composition of a
majority of the Board within twelve (12) months after any "person" is or becomes
the beneficial owner, directly or indirectly, of 20% or more of the voting power
of the then outstanding securities of the Corporation.


                                      -13-


<PAGE>
                     (h)  For  purposes  of  this  Agreement,   any  good  faith
determination  of "Good Reason" made by the Employee under  Paragraph 5(f) shall
be conclusive.

                     (i)   Anything   in   this   Agreement   to  the   contrary
notwithstanding,  in the  event it  shall be  determined  that  any  payment  or
distribution by the Corporation to Employee or for his benefit  (whether paid or
payable or distributed or distributable  pursuant to the terms of this Agreement
or otherwise) (a  "Payment"),  would be  nondeductible  by the  Corporation  for
Federal income tax purposes because of Section 280G of the Internal Revenue Code
of 1986,  as amended (the "Code"),  then the aggregate  present value of amounts
payable  or  distributable  to  Employee  or for his  benefit  pursuant  to this
Agreement  (such  payments  or  distributions  pursuant  to this  Agreement  are
hereinafter  referred  to as  "Agreement  Payments")  shall  be  reduced  to the
"Reduced  Amount".  The "Reduced Amount" shall be an amount expressed in present
value which maximizes the aggregate present value of Agreement  Payments without
causing any Payment to be  nondeductible  by the Corporation  because of Section
280G of the Code.  For  purposes  of  paragraph  5(i),  present  value  shall be
determined in accordance with Section 280G(d)(4) of the Code.

                         (i)  All  determinations  required  to  be  made  under
subparagraph 5(i) shall be made by the Corporation's then independent  certified
accountants,  which shall provide detailed  supporting  calculations both to the
Corporation  and Employee  within fifteen (15) business days of the  Termination
Date, or


                                      -14-


<PAGE>
such earlier time as is requested by the  Corporation,  and a written opinion to
Employee at the Corporation's  cost that Employee has substantial  authority not
to report any Excise Tax on Employee's federal income tax return with respect to
the Payments.  Any such  determination  by the  Corporation's  then  independent
certified  accountants  shall be binding upon the  Corporation and the Employee.
Employee shall  determine which and how much of the Payments shall be eliminated
or reduced consistent with the requirements of subparagraph 5(i), provided that,
if Employee  does not make such  determination  within ten business  days of the
receipt of the calculations made by the Corporation's then independent certified
accountants,  the  Corporation  shall elect  which and how much of the  Payments
shall be eliminated or reduced consistent with the requirements of paragraph (i)
and shall notify Employee  promptly of such election.  Within five business days
thereafter,  the  Corporation  shall pay to or  distribute  to  Employee  or for
Employee's  benefit  such  amounts  as are  then  due  to  Employee  under  this
Agreement. For purposes of paragraph (i), "Excise Tax" shall mean the excise tax
imposed by Section 4999 of the Code or any interest or penalties with respect to
such excise tax.

                         (ii) As a result of the  uncertainty in the application
of  Section  280G of the Code at the time of the  initial  determination  by the
Corporation's then certified independent  accountants hereunder,  it is possible
that Payments will have been made by the Corporation which should not have been


                                                       -15-
<PAGE>
made  ("Overpayment") or that Additional  Payments which will not have been made
by the  Corporation  could  have  been  made  ("Underpayment"),  in  each  case,
consistent with the  calculations  required to be made  hereunder.  In the event
that the Corporation's then certified  independent  accountants,  based upon the
assertion of a deficiency by the Internal Revenue Service against Employee which
the Corporation's  then certified  independent  accountants  believes has a high
probability of success  determines  that an Overpayment  has been made, any such
Overpayment paid or distributed by the Corporation to Employee or for Employee's
benefit shall be treated for all purposes as a loan ab initio to Employee  which
Employee shall repay to the Corporation together with interest at the applicable
federal rate provided for in Section 7872(f)(2) of the Code; provided,  however,
that no such loan  shall be  deemed  to have  been  made and no amount  shall be
payable by Employee to the Corporation if and to the extent such deemed loan and
payment would not either  reduce the amount on which  Employee is subject to tax
under Section 1 and Section 4999 of the Code or generate a refund of such taxes.
In the event that the  Corporation's  then  certified  independent  accountants,
based upon controlling precedent or other substantial authority, determines that
an Underpayment has occurred,  any such  Underpayment  shall be promptly paid by
the  Corporation  to the Employee or for the  Employee's  benefit  together with
interest at the  applicable  federal rate provided for in Section  7872(f)(2) of
the Code.


                                      -16-


<PAGE>

                     (j) The  Employee  shall not be required  to  mitigate  the
amount of any Payment provided for in paragraph 5(i) by seeking other employment
or otherwise, nor shall the amount of any Payment provided for in paragraph 5(i)
be  reduced  by any  compensation  earned  by the  Employee  as  the  result  of
employment by another  employer after the  Termination  Date, or otherwise.  The
Corporation's obligation to make the Payments provided for in paragraph 5(i) and
otherwise  to perform  its  obligations  hereunder  shall not be affected by any
set-off, counterclaim, recoupment, defense or other claim, right or action which
it may have against Employee or others.

                     (k) The  failure by  Employee to set forth in any notice of
termination  of employment  any fact or  circumstances  which  contributes  to a
showing of Good Reason  shall not waive any of  Employee's  rights  hereunder or
preclude the Employee  from  asserting  such fact or  circumstance  in enforcing
Employee's rights hereunder.

                     (l) If a Change of Control occurs, the terms and provisions
of  paragraph  5(i) of this  Agreement  governing  the payments to be made shall
control in lieu of any provisions elsewhere in this Agreement.

                     (m) The  Corporation  will require any  successor  (whether
direct or indirect, by purchase,  merger,  consolidation or otherwise) to all or
substantially  all of the business and/or assets of the Corporation to expressly
assume and agree to perform  according  to paragraph 5 in the same manner and to
the


                                                       -17-
<PAGE>
same  extent  that the  Corporation  would be  required to perform it if no such
succession  had taken place.  As used in this paragraph 5,  "Corporation"  shall
mean the Corporation as  hereinbefore  defined and any successor to its business
and/or assets as aforesaid which assumes and agrees to perform this Agreement by
operation of law, or otherwise.

                  6. The Employee  acknowledges  that, because of his duties and
his position of trust under this  Agreement,  he will become familiar with trade
secrets  and other  confidential  information  (including,  but not  limited to,
operating  methods and procedures,  secret lists of actual and potential sources
of supply, customers and employees, costs, profits, markets, sales and plans for
future  developments)  which are  valuable  assets  and  property  rights of the
Corporation and not publicly known. Except in connection with the performance of
his duties for the  Corporation  the Employee agrees that he will not, during or
at any time after the term of this  Agreement,  either  directly or  indirectly,
disclose  to any  person,  firm or  corporation  such  trade  secrets  or  other
confidential  information,  including,  but not limited to, any facts concerning
the systems, methods,  procedures or plans developed or used by the Corporation.
The  Employee  agrees to retain all such trade  secrets  and other  confidential
information in a fiduciary capacity for the sole benefit of the Corporation, its
successors and assigns. Upon termination of his employment by the Corporation or
at any time that the Corporation may so request, the Employee will surrender


                                      -18-
<PAGE>
to the Corporation  all non-public  papers,  notes,  reports and other documents
(and all copies thereof)  relating to the business of the  Corporation  which he
may then possess or have under his control.

                  7. For a period of two (2) years  following the  expiration or
earlier  termination of this Agreement and within a two hundred fifty (250) mile
radius of the New York City the Employee  shall not,  without the prior  written
consent of the Corporation, directly or indirectly:

                     (a) solicit any business for or from, or become  associated
with, as principal,  agent, employee,  consultant, or in any other capacity, any
person  who, or entity  which,  at the time of, or during the twelve (12) months
immediately  preceding such expiration or termination was in direct  competition
with the Corporation;

                     (b) become a principal,  agent,  employee,  consultant,  or
otherwise  become  associated  with any person who, or entity  which,  has taken
affirmative  action which would permit such entity or person to actually  engage
in  direct  competition  with the  Corporation  during a period of two (2) years
following the expiration or earlier termination of this Agreement.

                  8. The  provisions of Paragraphs 6 and 7 of this Agreement are
of a unique  nature and of  extraordinary  value and of such a character  that a
material breach of the provisions of either  Paragraphs 6 or 7 of this Agreement
by the Employee will result in irreparable  damage and injury to the Corporation
for


                                      -19-
<PAGE>
which the Corporation  will not have any adequate remedy at law.  Therefore,  in
the event that the Employee commits or threatens to commit any such breach,  the
Corporation  will  have (a) the  right  and  remedy  to have the  provisions  of
Paragraphs 6 and 7 of this Agreement  specifically  enforced by any court having
equity  jurisdiction,  it being agreed that in any proceeding for an injunction,
and upon any motion for a temporary  or  permanent  injunction,  the  Employee's
ability to answer in damages  shall not be a bar or  interposed  as a defense to
the  granting  of such  injunction  and (b) the right and remedy to require  the
Employee to account  for and to pay over to the  Corporation  all  compensation,
profits, monies,  accruals,  increments and other benefits (hereinafter referred
to collectively as the "Benefits") derived or received by him as a result of any
transactions  constituting a breach of any of the provisions of Paragraphs 6 and
7 of this Agreement,  and the Employee hereby agrees to account for and pay over
such Benefits to the Corporation.  Each of the rights and remedies enumerated in
(a) and (b) above  shall be  independent  of the other,  and shall be  severally
enforceable,  and all of such rights and  remedies  shall be in addition to, and
not in lieu of, any other rights and remedies available to the Corporation under
law or in equity.

                  9. In the event  that any  provision,  or any  portion  of any
provision,  of this  Agreement  shall be held to be void or  unenforceable,  the
remaining  provisions  of this  Agreement,  and  the  remaining  portion  of any
provision found void or


                                      -20-


<PAGE>

unenforceable in part only, shall continue in full force and effect.

                  10. The Employee  represents  and warrants that he has made no
commitment  of any kind  whatsoever  inconsistent  with the  provisions  of this
Agreement  and that he is under no  disability  of any kind to enter  into  this
Agreement and to perform all of his obligations hereunder.

                  11. This Agreement  shall inure to the benefit of and shall be
binding upon the parties  hereto and their  respective  successors and permitted
assigns.  This Agreement  being personal to the Employee,  cannot be assigned by
him.  This  Agreement  may be  assigned by the  Corporation  in the event and in
connection with a merger,  consolidation or sale of all or substantially  all of
the assets of the  Corporation  provided that the assignee  agrees in writing to
assume all of the  obligations of the Corporation  under this Agreement.  Prompt
written notice of such  assignment  shall be provided by the  Corporation to the
Employee.

                  12. Any dispute or controversy between the parties relating to
or arising out of this Agreement or any amendment or  modification  hereof shall
be determined by the Supreme  Court,  County of Nassau,  State of New York.  The
service of any notice,  process,  motion or other document in connection with an
action under this Agreement may be effectuated by either personal service upon a
party or by  certified  mail duly  addressed  to him at his address set forth on
page 1 hereof.

<PAGE>
                  13. Unless  otherwise  required by law, the Corporation  shall
not recognize any  assignment,  transfer,  pledge,  hypothecation,  execution or
attachment of any amount or part thereof which becomes payable hereunder.

                  14. Any notice or  communication  required or  permitted to be
given  hereunder  shall be deemed duly given if delivered  personally or sent by
registered or certified mail,  return receipt  requested,  to the address of the
intended  recipient as herein set forth or to such other  address as a party may
theretofore  have specified in writing to the other. Any notice or communication
intended for the Corporation shall be addressed to the attention of its Board of
Directors.

                  15.  A  waiver  of  any  breach  or  violation  of  any  term,
provision,  agreement,  covenant,  or condition  herein  contained  shall not be
deemed to be a  continuing  waiver or a waiver of any  future or past  breach or
violation.

                  16.  This  Agreement  constitutes  the  entire  agreement  and
understanding  between the Corporation and the Employee relating to the latter's
employment,  supersedes any prior agreement between the parties relating to such
matter,  shall be governed by and construed in  accordance  with the laws of the
State of New York and may not be changed, terminated or discharged orally.

restate  the terms of the Prior  Amendment,  upon and  subject  to the terms and
conditions of this amended and restated employment agreement (the "Agreement"),

                  NOW,  THEREFORE,  in  consideration  of the  mutual  covenants
herein contained and for other good and valuable consideration,  it is agreed as

shall use its best efforts to have the Employee elected as a member of the Board
of Directors of the  Corporation  and shall include the Employee in the slate of
management nominees at the expiration of each term for which the Employee served
as a member of the Board of Directors of the Corporation. So long as he shall be
a director  of the  Corporation,  the  Employee  shall  serve as a member of the
Corporation's Executive Committee and Compensation Committee.

                     (c) The Employee  agrees to devote his full  business  time
during regular  business hours to working for the Corporation and performing the
aforesaid duties and such other duties as shall from time to time be assigned to
him by the Board of Directors of the Corporation consistent with his position as
President of the Corporation.  During the term of his employment hereunder,  the
Employee  shall have no interest  in, or perform  any  services  during  regular
business hours for any other company, whether or not such company is competitive

public companies whose stock is traded on a national  securities  exchange or in
the over-the-counter market and (ii) service as a director of a corporation that

                                       -2-

<PAGE>
Corporation,  which consent may not be  unreasonably  withheld.  For purposes of
this paragraph 1(c), a "passive  investment"  shall be deemed to mean investment
in a business  which  does not  require  or result in the  participation  of the
Employee in the  management or  operations of such business  except during times
other than regular  business  hours and which does not interfere with his duties
and  responsibilities  to the Corporation.  Nothing contained herein shall limit
the right of the Employee to make  speeches,  write  articles or  participate in
public  debate and  discussions  in and by means of any medium of  communication
provided  that  such  activities  are  not  inconsistent   with  the  Employee's
obligations hereunder.

                     The foregoing to the contrary notwithstanding, the Employee
may  perform  such  other  activities  as shall  be  required  to wind  down his
responsibilities to his prior accounting practice, Patrusky Mintz & Semel.

                     (d) Consistent with the Employee's  aforesaid  duties,  the
Employee  shall,  at all  times  during  the  term  hereof,  be  subject  to the
supervision  and  direction of the Board of Directors  of the  Corporation  with
respect to his duties, responsibilities and the exercise of his powers.

                     (e)  The  services  of  the  Employee  hereunder  shall  be
rendered  primarily  in the  metropolitan  area of the  City of New  York at the
Corporation's  principal executive offices,  currently located in Nassau County;
provided,  however,  that the  Employee  shall  make such  trips  outside of the
metropolitan area of the

                  charges are brought  against  the  Employee by a  governmental
                  authority or, in the  determination  of the Board of Directors
                  of the Corporation,  be guilty of willful malfeasance or gross
                  negligence which materially and adversely affects the business
                  of the  Corporation.  (b) For purposes of this Agreement,  the
                  Employee shall

be deemed  permanently  incapacitated  in the event that the Employee  shall, by
reason of his physical or mental disability,  fail to substantially  perform his
usual and regular duties for the Corporation for a consecutive  period of twelve
(12) months or for twelve  (12) months in the  aggregate  in any  eighteen  (18)
month  period;  provided,  however,  that  the  Employee  shall  not  be  deemed
permanently  incapacitated  unless  and  until a  physician,  duly  licensed  to
practice medicine and reasonably acceptable to the Corporation and the Employee,
shall certify in writing to the  Corporation  that the nature of the  Employee's
disability  is such that it will  continue as a  substantial  impediment  to the
Employee's ability to substantially perform his duties hereunder.

                  5. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein:


                                      -11-


<PAGE>

                     (a)  During  the term of this  Agreement,  the  Corporation
agrees to pay the  insurance  premiums on any  insurance  policies  owned by the
Employee  and issued at  "standard  rates," in an  aggregate  face amount not to
exceed $1,000,000;  provided,  however,  that the annual premium costs shall not
exceed  $7,500.00 per annum. In the event that the Employee shall die during the
term of this Agreement, the Corporation shall, in lieu of any other compensation
payable  hereunder,  pay  (i) to the  beneficiaries  theretofore  designated  in
writing by the Employee (or to the  Employee's  estate if no such  beneficiaries
shall have been designated),  a sum equal to the total  compensation of any kind
paid to the  Employee  pursuant  to  paragraph 2 during the  Corporation's  last
fiscal year prior to the death of the Employee, less the aggregate amount of any
insurance  proceeds received by the Corporation on insurance policies it owns on
the life of the  Employee,  which shall be paid to the Employee  upon receipt by
the  Corporation,  in  twenty-four  (24)  equal  monthly  installments,  without
interest,  with the first  such  installment  to be paid on the first day of the
second month  following the date of death and the remaining  installments  to be
paid on each of the following  twenty-three  (23) monthly  anniversary  dates of
such first payment;  and (ii) to the Employee's estate, all sums due and payable
by the  Corporation  to the Employee for any periods  prior to the date of death
(and not theretofore paid).

                     (b) In the event that the Employee shall become permanently
incapacitated, then for the period prior to any


                                      -12-

<PAGE>

termination of his employment in accordance with paragraph  4(a)(ii) above, as a
result of the Employee becoming  permanently  incapacitated,  the Employee shall
continue to receive one hundred percent (100%) of his regular annual Base Salary
provided for herein which is attributable to such period. Such payments shall be
in addition to all income  disability  benefits,  if any, which the Employee may
receive from policies  provided by or through the Corporation,  or individually,
including state-required short-term disability.

                     (c) In the event that the  employment of the Employee shall
be  terminated  by reason of the Employee  becoming  permanently  incapacitated,
then, as additional  consideration for his past services to the Corporation,  he
shall receive one hundred percent (100%) of his then current annual Base Salary,
in equal monthly  installments,  without  interest,  for a period of twelve (12)
months from the date of such termination.

                     (d)  In  the  event  of a  termination  of  the  Employee's
employment  pursuant to paragraph  4(a)(iii)  above,  the Employee  shall not be
entitled to any payments other than such  compensation as shall have been earned
by him prior to the occurrence of the event giving rise to the  termination  and
not paid as of the date of such termination.

                     (e) In the event that the Corporation  shall desire to fund
the death benefits  payable under paragraph 5(a) above with a policy or policies
of  insurance  on the life of the Employee or the  disability  benefits  payable
under paragraphs 5(b) and 5(c)


                                      -13-


<PAGE>
above  with  a  disability   policy,  the  Employee  shall  cooperate  with  the
Corporation  in obtaining such  insurance  policy(ies)  and shall submit to such
medical examinations and execute such documents as may be required in connection
with the obtaining of such insurance.

                     (f) The Employee may  terminate  this  Agreement  for "Good
Reason." For purposes of this  Agreement,  "Good Reason"  shall mean,  that if a
Change in Control (as hereinafter defined) has occurred, a determination is made
by the Employee,  in writing  (which  written notice shall specify in detail the
full facts and circumstances thereof), that as a result of the Change in Control
and a change in circumstances  thereafter affecting his position,  the Employee,
in his sole  discretion  (exercised  in good faith),  determines  that (x) he is
unable to exercise the authorities, functions, duties or responsibilities of the
positions  for which he is hereby  employed or (y) there is otherwise a material
change  in  the  nature  or  scope  of the  authorities,  functions,  duties  or
responsibilities  of the  positions  in which the  Employee is hereby  employed,
either of which  situation is not remedied within thirty (30) days after receipt
by the Corporation of written notice from the Employee of such determination.

                     In the event the Employee  exercises  his rights under this
paragraph  5(f),  he shall be  entitled  to a lump sum  amount  (the  "Severance
Payment")  equal  to  the  product  of  2.99  times  the  average  total  annual
compensation  of any kind paid to the  Employee  by the  Corporation  during the
Corporation's last five


                                      -14-
<PAGE>

full fiscal years prior to the date of termination of employment.  The Severance
Payment earned in accordance  with this paragraph 5(f) shall be paid to Employee
within  five (5) days after the date of  termination  of  Employee's  employment
(hereinafter  referred to as the "Termination  Date") and all other amounts,  if
any, to be paid to Employee  pursuant to a Change of Control  shall also be paid
by the  Corporation  within five (5) days of the Termination  Date  (hereinafter
referred  to as the  "Payment  Date"),  unless the  applicable  plan or document
governing the other amounts,  if any, states otherwise.  In addition,  all stock
options  the  Employee  holds  shall  vest  upon a  Change  of  Control  and the
provisions  of  paragraph 7 of this  Agreement  shall be null and void as of the
date of termination of employment.

                     (g) For  the  purposes  of this  Agreement,  a  "Change  in
Control"  shall be deemed to have  occurred  upon the  occurrence  of any of the
following:  (i) the acquisition of the  "beneficial  ownership," as such term is
defined in Rule 13d-3 promulgated under the Securities  Exchange Act of 1934 (as
amended, the "1934 Act"), from and after the date of this Agreement, directly or
indirectly, of 20% or more of the outstanding voting stock of the Corporation or
any parent corporation of the Corporation by one or more "persons" (as such term
is used in Sections 13(d) and 14(d)(2) of the 1934 Act), whether or not any such
persons are affiliated or acting  individually  or as a group and whether or not
any such acquisition  occurs as a result of one or more transactions  (which may
or may not occur at the same time), by


                                      -15-


<PAGE>
any  person  who  did  not  own,  directly  or  indirectly,  20% of  more of the
outstanding  voting stock of the  Corporation as of the date of this  Agreement,
(ii) if all or substantially  all of the business of the Corporation is disposed
of  pursuant to a transfer of the  Corporation's  assets to any person,  (iii) a
merger,  consolidation or other  transaction in which the Corporation is not the
surviving  corporation,  (iv) if the  Corporation  is  materially  or completely
liquidated, or (v) a change in the composition of a majority of the Board within
twelve  (12) months  after any  "person"  is or becomes  the  beneficial  owner,
directly  or  indirectly,  of 20%  or  more  of the  voting  power  of the  then
outstanding securities of the Corporation.

                     (h)  For  purposes  of  this  Agreement,   any  good  faith
determination  of "Good Reason" made by the Employee under  Paragraph 5(f) shall
be conclusive.

                     (i)   Anything   in   this   Agreement   to  the   contrary
notwithstanding,  in the  event it  shall be  determined  that  any  payment  or
distribution by the Corporation to Employee or for his benefit  (whether paid or
payable or distributed or distributable  pursuant to the terms of this Agreement
or otherwise) (a  "Payment"),  would be  nondeductible  by the  Corporation  for
Federal income tax purposes because of Section 280G of the Internal Revenue Code
of 1986,  as amended (the "Code"),  then the aggregate  present value of amounts
payable  or  distributable  to  Employee  or for his  benefit  pursuant  to this
Agreement  (such  payments  or  distributions  pursuant  to this  Agreement  are
hereinafter referred


                                      -16-


<PAGE>
to as  "Agreement  Payments")  shall be reduced  to the  "Reduced  Amount".  The
"Reduced  Amount" shall be an amount  expressed in present value which maximizes
the aggregate present value of Agreement Payments without causing any Payment to
be  nondeductible  by the  Corporation  because of Section 280G of the Code. For
purposes of paragraph 5(i), present value shall be determined in accordance with
Section 280G(d)(4) of the Code.

                     (i)  All   determinations   required   to  be  made   under
subparagraph 5(i) shall be made by the Corporation's then independent  certified
accountants,  which shall provide detailed  supporting  calculations both to the
Corporation  and Employee  within fifteen (15) business days of the  Termination
Date,  or such earlier time as is  requested by the  Corporation,  and a written
opinion to Employee at the  Corporation's  cost that  Employee  has  substantial
authority not to report any Excise Tax on Employee's  federal  income tax return
with respect to the Payments.  Any such  determination by the Corporation's then
independent  certified accountants shall be binding upon the Corporation and the
Employee.  Employee shall  determine which and how much of the Payments shall be
eliminated or reduced  consistent with the  requirements  of subparagraph  5(i),
provided that, if Employee does not make such determination  within ten business
days  of the  receipt  of  the  calculations  made  by  the  Corporation's  then
independent  certified  accountants,  the Corporation  shall elect which and how
much of the  Payments  shall  be  eliminated  or  reduced  consistent  with  the
requirements of


                                      -17-


<PAGE>

paragraph (i) and shall notify Employee  promptly of such election.  Within five
business days thereafter, the Corporation shall pay to or distribute to Employee
or for  Employee's  benefit such amounts as are then due to Employee  under this
Agreement. For purposes of paragraph (i), "Excise Tax" shall mean the excise tax
imposed by Section 4999 of the Code or any interest or penalties with respect to
such excise tax.

                                   (ii)    As a result of the uncertainty in the
application of Section 280G of the Code at the time of the initial determination
by the Corporation's then certified  independent  accountants  hereunder,  it is
possible that Payments will have been made by the  Corporation  which should not
have been made  ("Overpayment") or that Additional  Payments which will not have
been made by the  Corporation  could  have been made  ("Underpayment"),  in each
case,  consistent with the  calculations  required to be made hereunder.  In the
event that the Corporation's then certified independent accountants,  based upon
the assertion of a deficiency by the Internal  Revenue Service against  Employee
which the Corporation's then certified  independent  accountants  believes has a
high  probability of success  determines  that an Overpayment has been made, any
such  Overpayment  paid or  distributed  by the  Corporation  to Employee or for
Employee's  benefit  shall be treated  for all  purposes  as a loan ab initio to
Employee which Employee shall repay to the Corporation together with interest at
the  applicable  federal rate  provided for in Section  7872(f)(2)  of the Code;
provided,


                                      -18-


<PAGE>
however, that no such loan shall be deemed to have been made and no amount shall
be payable by Employee to the  Corporation if and to the extent such deemed loan
and payment would not either  reduce the amount on which  Employee is subject to
tax under  Section 1 and  Section  4999 of the Code or generate a refund of such
taxes.  In  the  event  that  the  Corporation's   then  certified   independent
accountants,  based upon controlling  precedent or other substantial  authority,
determines that an Underpayment  has occurred,  any such  Underpayment  shall be
promptly paid by the  Corporation to the Employee or for the Employee's  benefit
together  with interest at the  applicable  federal rate provided for in Section
7872(f)(2) of the Code.

                     (j) The  Employee  shall not be required  to  mitigate  the
amount of any Payment provided for in paragraph 5(i) by seeking other employment
or otherwise, nor shall the amount of any Payment provided for in paragraph 5(i)
be  reduced  by any  compensation  earned  by the  Employee  as  the  result  of
employment by another  employer after the  Termination  Date, or otherwise.  The
Corporation's obligation to make the Payments provided for in paragraph 5(i) and
otherwise  to perform  its  obligations  hereunder  shall not be affected by any
set-off, counterclaim, recoupment, defense or other claim, right or action which
it may have against Employee or others.

                     (k) The  failure by  Employee to set forth in any notice of
termination  of employment  any fact or  circumstances  which  contributes  to a
showing of Good Reason shall not waive any of


                                      -19-


<PAGE>

Employee's rights hereunder or preclude the Employee from asserting such fact or
circumstance in enforcing Employee's rights hereunder.

                     (l) If a Change of Control occurs, the terms and provisions
of  paragraph  5(i) of this  Agreement  governing  the payments to be made shall
control in lieu of any provisions elsewhere in this Agreement.

                     (m) The  Corporation  will require any  successor  (whether
direct or indirect, by purchase,  merger,  consolidation or otherwise) to all or
substantially  all of the business and/or assets of the Corporation to expressly
assume and agree to perform  according  to paragraph 5 in the same manner and to
the same extent that the Corporation  would be required to perform it if no such
succession  had taken place.  As used in this paragraph 5,  "Corporation"  shall
mean the Corporation as  hereinbefore  defined and any successor to its business
and/or assets as aforesaid which assumes and agrees to perform this Agreement by
operation of law, or otherwise.

                  6. The Employee  acknowledges  that, because of his duties and
his position of trust under this  Agreement,  he will become familiar with trade
secrets  and other  confidential  information  (including,  but not  limited to,
operating  methods and procedures,  secret lists of actual and potential sources
of supply, customers and employees, costs, profits, markets, sales and plans for
future  developments)  which are  valuable  assets  and  property  rights of the
Corporation and not publicly known.


                                      -20-

<PAGE>

Except in connection with the performance of his duties for the Corporation, the
Employee  agrees that he will not,  during or at any time after the term of this
Agreement,  either  directly or  indirectly,  disclose  to any  person,  firm or
corporation such trade secrets or other confidential information, including, but
not limited to, any facts concerning the systems,  methods,  procedures or plans
developed or used by the  Corporation.  The  Employee  agrees to retain all such
trade secrets and other confidential information in a fiduciary capacity for the
sole benefit of the Corporation, its successors and assigns. Upon termination of
his  employment by the  Corporation or at any time that the  Corporation  may so
request,  the Employee will surrender to the Corporation all non-public  papers,
notes,  reports and other  documents  (and all copies  thereof)  relating to the
business of the Corporation which he may then possess or have under his control.

                  7. For a period of two (2) years  following the  expiration or
earlier  termination of this Agreement and within a two hundred fifty (250) mile
radius  of New York City the  Employee  shall  not,  without  the prior  written
consent of the Corporation, directly or indirectly:

                     (a) solicit any business for or from, or become  associated
with, as principal,  agent, employee,  consultant, or in any other capacity, any
person  who, or entity  which,  at the time of, or during the twelve (12) months
immediately preceding such


                                      -21-


<PAGE>
expiration or termination was in direct competition with the Corporation;

                     (b) become a principal,  agent,  employee,  consultant,  or
otherwise  become  associated  with any person who, or entity  which,  has taken
affirmative  action which would permit such entity or person to actually  engage
in  direct  competition  with the  Corporation  during a period of two (2) years
following the expiration or earlier termination of this Agreement.

                  8. The  provisions of Paragraphs 6 and 7 of this Agreement are
of a unique  nature and of  extraordinary  value and of such a character  that a
material breach of the provisions of either  Paragraphs 6 or 7 of this Agreement
by the Employee will result in irreparable  damage and injury to the Corporation
for which the Corporation  will not have any adequate remedy at law.  Therefore,
in the event that the  Employee  commits or threatens to commit any such breach,
the  Corporation  will have (a) the right and remedy to have the  provisions  of
Paragraphs 6 and 7 of this Agreement  specifically  enforced by any court having
equity  jurisdiction,  it being agreed that in any proceeding for an injunction,
and upon any motion for a temporary  or  permanent  injunction,  the  Employee's
ability to answer in damages  shall not be a bar or  interposed  as a defense to
the  granting  of such  injunction  and (b) the right and remedy to require  the
Employee to account  for and to pay over to the  Corporation  all  compensation,
profits, monies,  accruals,  increments and other benefits (hereinafter referred
to collectively as the "Benefits")


                                      -22-


<PAGE>
derived or received by him as a result of any transactions constituting a breach
of any of the  provisions  of  Paragraphs  6 and 7 of  this  Agreement,  and the
Employee  hereby  agrees  to  account  for and pay  over  such  Benefits  to the
Corporation.  Each of the rights and  remedies  enumerated  in (a) and (b) above
shall be independent of the other, and shall be severally  enforceable,  and all
of such rights and  remedies  shall be in  addition  to, and not in lieu of, any
other rights and remedies available to the Corporation under law or in equity.

                  9. In the event  that any  provision,  or any  portion  of any
provision,  of this  Agreement  shall be held to be void or  unenforceable,  the
remaining  provisions  of this  Agreement,  and  the  remaining  portion  of any
provision found void or unenforceable in part only, shall continue in full force
and effect.

                  10. The Employee  represents  and warrants that he has made no
commitment  of any kind  whatsoever  inconsistent  with the  provisions  of this
Agreement  and that he is under no  disability  of any kind to enter  into  this
Agreement and to perform all of his obligations hereunder.

                  11. This Agreement  shall inure to the benefit of and shall be
binding upon the parties and their respective  successors and permitted assigns.
This Agreement  being personal to the Employee,  cannot be assigned by him. This
Agreement may be assigned by the Corporation in the event and in connection with
a merger, consolidation or sale of all or substantially all of the


                                      -23-


<PAGE>
assets of the Corporation provided that the assignee agrees in writing to assume
all of the obligations of the Corporation  under this Agreement.  Prompt written
notice of such assignment shall be provided by the Corporation to the Employee.

                  12. Any dispute or controversy between the parties relating to
or arising  out of this  Agreement  or any  amendment  or  modification  hereof,
including  but not  limited to the  selection  of a  physician  as  provided  in
Sections  4(b) and 5(b) of this  Agreement,  shall be  determined by the Supreme
Court, County of Nassau, State of New York. The service of any notice,  process,
motion or other document in connection with an action under this Agreement,  may
be effectuated by either personal service upon a party or by certified mail duly
addressed to him at his address set forth on page 1 hereof.

                  13. Any notice or  communication  required or  permitted to be
given  hereunder  shall be deemed duly given if delivered  personally or sent by
registered or certified mail,  return receipt  requested,  to the address of the
intended  recipient as herein set forth or to such other  address as a party may
theretofore  have specified in writing to the other. Any notice or communication
intended for the Corporation shall be addressed to the attention of its Board of
Directors.

                  14.  A  waiver  of  any  breach  or  violation  of  any  term,
provision,  agreement,  covenant,  or condition  herein  contained  shall not be
deemed to be a  continuing  waiver or a waiver of any  future or past  breach or
violation.

<PAGE>
                  15.  This  Agreement  constitutes  the  entire  agreement  and
understanding  between the Corporation and the Employee relating to the latter's
employment,  supersedes any prior agreement between the parties relating to such
matter,  shall be governed by and construed in  accordance  with the laws of the
State of New York and may not be changed, terminated or discharged orally.

                  IN WITNESS WHEREOF, the parties hereto have hereunto set their
hands as of the day and year first above written.

                     (b) The Employee agrees to devote his full business time to
working for the Corporation  and performing the aforesaid  duties and such other
duties as shall from time to time be assigned  to him by the Board of  Directors
of the Corporation  consistent with his position as Senior Vice President of the
Corporation.  During the term of his  employment  hereunder,  the Employee shall
have no interest in, or perform any services for, any other  company  whether or
not  such  company  is  competitive  with  the  Corporation,  except  that  this
prohibition  shall not be deemed to apply to passive  investments  in businesses
not competitive  with the business of the Corporation or to investments of 5% or
less of the  outstanding  stock of public  companies  whose stock is traded on a
national securities exchange or is traded in the  over-the-counter  market or to
any  ownership  interest  of the  Employee  in  Wickatunk  Motivators,  Inc.,  a
speciality  advertising company operated by the Employee's wife. For purposes of
this  paragraph  l(b),  a  "passive  investment"  shall  be  deemed  to mean the
investment in a business  which does not require or result in the  participation
of the Employee in the  management or operations of such business  except during
times other than regular  business  hours and which does not interfere  with his
duties and  responsibilities to the Corporation.  Nothing contained herein shall
limit the right of the Employee to make speeches,  write articles or participate
in public debate and discussions in and by means of any medium of  communication
provided that such


                                       -2-
<PAGE>

activities are not inconsistent with the Employee's obligations hereunder.

                     (c) Consistent with the Employee's  aforesaid  duties,  the
Employee  shall,  at all  times  during  the  term  hereof,  be  subject  to the
supervision  and  direction of the Board of Directors  of the  Corporation  with
respect to his duties, responsibilities and the exercise of his powers.

                     (d)  The  services  of  the  Employee  hereunder  shall  be
rendered primarily in the metropolitan area of the City of New York primarily in
Nassau  County  at the  Corporation's  principal  executive  offices;  provided,
however,  that the Employee  shall make such trips  outside of the  metropolitan
area of the City of New York as shall be reasonably necessary in connection with
the Employee's duties hereunder.

                  2. The  Corporation  shall pay to the Employee during the term
of his  employment  by the  Corporation  and the  Employee  shall  accept as his
compensation for his services hereunder:

                     (a) (i)  Commissions  on all  products  of the  Corporation
(including all of its  subsidiaries  and divisions)  sold by the Employee at the
Corporation's standard commission rates in effect at the time of any such sale;

                         (ii)  Commissions  on all ASI Sales,  whether or not by
the Employee, as follows:

                               (a) One  percent  (1%) of all ASI Sales up to and
including One Million Five Hundred Thousand  Dollars  ($1,500,000) in any fiscal
year; and

                                                        -3-

<PAGE>

                               (b) One and One  Quarter  Percent (1 1/4%) of all
ASI Sales in excess of One Million Five Hundred Thousand Dollars ($1,500,000) in
any fiscal year.

                     (b)  Commissions  provided for in  subparagraph  2(a) above
shall be payable only on net sales proceeds actually received by the Corporation
which,  for purposes of such  subparagraph,  shall be deemed to mean gross sales
less returns, price allowances and discounts.  In this connection,  the Employee
acknowledges  and agrees that all orders  obtained by the Employee  and/or other
salesman for the  Corporation  are subject to the  Corporation's  acceptance  or
rejection.

                     (c) For any period  during  which the Employee is unable to
fully perform his usual and regular duties for the Corporation, such payments of
compensation  shall be reduced by an amount equal to the aggregate of all income
disability benefits which he may receive. If the Employee shall receive any such
payment from the Corporation  then, to the extent that he subsequently  receives
any payment of disability  benefits  attributable to the period for which he was
paid by the Corporation, he shall promptly reimburse the Corporation.

                     (d)  The  Corporation   shall  grant  to  the  Employee  an
incentive stock option to purchase up to Ten Thousand  (10,000) shares of Common
Stock of the Corporation  pursuant to the  Corporation's  1993 Stock Option Plan
and in accordance  with the option  letter  agreement  (the "Option  Agreement")
between the


                                       -4-

<PAGE>
Employee and the Corporation.  The Option Agreement is attached as EXHIBIT A and
made a part of this Agreement.

                     (e) The  Corporation  will  reimburse  the Employee for his
necessary and reasonable  out-of-pocket  expenses  incurred in the course of his
employment  and in  connection  with his  duties  hereunder,  as  requested  and
approved  by  the  Corporation  and  upon  presentation  to the  Corporation  of
satisfactory  evidence of such expenses provided those expenses are corporate in
nature. Any selling expenses incurred to produce direct sales for the Employee's
Accounts shall be borne by the Employee.

                     (f) The Corporation  will provide the Employee with medical
insurance  coverage under the  Corporation's  group medical insurance policy and
the  Employee  shall  be  entitled  to  participate  in  all  health,   welfare,
retirement, disability and other benefit plans available to employees and senior
executives of the Corporation.

                     (g) The  Employee  shall be  entitled  to thirty  (30) paid
vacation  and/or sick days during each twelve (12) month period  during the term
of this Agreement.

                  3. (a) The term of the Employee's  employment  hereunder shall
be  deemed to  commence  effective  as of  February  1, 1996 and shall  continue
through January 31, 1998.

                     (b) The  Employee,  at his option,  shall have the right to
extend  the  term of  this  Agreement,  if not  previously  terminated,  for one
additional   one-year  period  (the   "Extension")  by  written  notice  to  the
Corporation no more than one hundred twenty (120)


                                       -5-

<PAGE>
days and no less than  sixty (60) days prior to  January  31,  1998.  All of the
terms and conditions of this Agreement shall be applicable during the Extension.

                  4. (a) This Agreement  (except as otherwise  provided  herein)
and the employment of the Employee hereunder shall terminate:

                         (i) automatically upon the death of the Employee;

                         (ii) at the  option of the  Corporation,  upon  written
notice  thereof to the  Employee,  in the event that the  Employee  shall become
permanently incapacitated (as hereinafter defined); and

                         (iii) at the option of the  Corporation,  upon 30 days'
prior written  notice thereof to the Employee  specifying the basis thereof,  in
the event of a material  breach by the Employee of any of the provisions of this
Agreement  which are not cured by the Employee within thirty (30) days after the
Employee is provided with such written notice, or in the event that the Employee
shall,  during  the  term of this  Agreement,  engage  in any  criminal  conduct
constituting a felony and criminal charges are brought against the Employee by a
governmental  authority,  or, in the  determination of the Board of Directors of
the  Corporation,  be guilty of willful  malfeasance or gross  negligence  which
would tend to materially and adversely affect the business of the Corporation.

                     (b) For purposes of this  Agreement,  the Employee shall be
deemed permanently incapacitated in the event that the


                                       -6-

<PAGE>

Employee  shall, by reason of his physical or mental  disability,  fail to fully
perform  his usual and  regular  duties for the  Corporation  for a  consecutive
period of twelve (12) months or for twelve (12) months in the  aggregate  in any
eighteen (18) month period;  provided,  however,  that the Employee shall not be
deemed permanently  incapacitated unless and until a physician, duly licensed to
practice medicine and reasonably acceptable to the Corporation and the Employee,
shall certify in writing to the  Corporation  that the nature of the  Employee's
disability  is such that it will  continue as a  substantial  impediment  to the
Employee's ability to perform his duties hereunder.

                  5. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein;

                     (a) In the event  that the  Employee  shall die  during the
term of this Agreement, the Corporation shall, in lieu of any other compensation
payable hereunder, pay to the beneficiaries theretofore designated in writing by
the Employee (or to the Employee's  estate if no such  beneficiaries  shall have
been designated), a sum equal to:

                         (i) One  Hundred  Percent  (100%)  of the  compensation
payable  to the  Employee  during  the  twelve  (12)  month  period  immediately
preceding the Employee's death, such sum to be paid in twelve (12) equal monthly
installments commencing one month following such death; and

                         (ii) Fifty Percent (50%) of the compensation payable to
the Employee during the twelve (12) month period


                                       -7-

<PAGE>
immediately  preceding the Employee's death, such sum to be paid in twelve equal
monthly  installments  commencing  on the  first  day of the  month  immediately
following the completion of the payments  provided for in  subparagraph  5(a)(i)
above.

         The sum of the  payments  provided  for in  subparagraphs  5(a)(i)  and
5(a)(ii) shall not,  however,  exceed Five Hundred Thousand Dollars  ($500,000),
and to the  extent  that  the  Corporation  receives  the  proceeds  of any life
insurance  on the life of the  Employee  (as  provided  in  Section  5(e))  such
proceeds shall be paid to the beneficiaries theretofore designated in writing by
the Employee (or the Employee's estate if no such beneficiaries  shall have been
designated) to fund the obligations under subparagraphs 5(a)(i) and 5(a)(ii) and
shall reduce such obligations on a dollar for dollar basis. The balance, if any,
due the Employee under  subparagraphs  5(a)(i) and 5(a)(ii) shall  thereafter be
paid in eighteen (18) equal monthly installments in lieu of the twenty-four (24)
monthly installments  otherwise specified in subparagraphs  5(a)(i) and 5(a)(ii)
provided that the insurance  proceeds  received by  Corporation  and paid to the
Employee's  beneficiaries  or estate  shall be equal or greater than Two Hundred
Fifty Thousand Dollars ($250,000).

                     (b)  In  the  event   that  the   Employee   shall   become
incapacitated, then for the period prior to any termination of his employment in
accordance  with paragraph  4(a)(ii) above as a result of the Employee  becoming
permanently  incapacitated,  the Employee  shall continue to receive one hundred
percent (100%) of his regular

                                       -8-

<PAGE>
annual  compensation  herein  provided for  attributable  to such  period.  Such
payments shall be in addition to all income disability  payments,  if any, which
the Employee may receive from policies  provided by or through the  Corporation,
including state-required short term disability.

                     (c) In the event that the  employment of the Employee shall
be  terminated  by reason  of his  permanent  incapacity,  then,  as  additional
consideration  for his past  services to the  Corporation,  he shall receive one
hundred  percent (100%) of the  compensation  payable to the Employee during the
twelve (12) month period  immediately  preceding the  Employee's  termination by
reason of his  permanent  incapacity,  in equal  monthly  installments,  without
interest, for a period of twelve (12) months from the date of such termination.

                     (d)  In  the  event  of a  termination  of  the  Employee's
employment  pursuant to paragraph  4(a)(iii)  above,  the Employee  shall not be
entitled to any payments other than such  compensation as shall have been earned
by him prior to the occurrence of the event giving rise to the  termination  and
not paid as of the date of such termination.

                     (e) In the event that the  Corporation  shall,  in its sole
and  absolute  discretion,  desire  to fund the  death  benefits  payable  under
paragraph  5(a) above with a policy or policies of  insurance on the life of the
Employee or the disability benefits payable under paragraphs 5(b) and 5(c) above
with a disability policy, the Employee shall cooperate with the Corporation in

                                       -9-


<PAGE>
obtaining  such  insurance   policy(ies)   and  shall  submit  to  such  medical
examinations  and execute such  documents as may be required in connection  with
the obtaining of such insurance.

                  6. The Employee  acknowledges  that, because of his duties and
his position of trust under this  Agreement,  he will become familiar with trade
secrets  and other  confidential  information  (including,  but not  limited to,
operating  methods and procedures,  secret lists of actual and potential sources
of supply, customers and employees, costs, profits, markets, sales and plans for
future  developments)  which are  valuable  assets  and  property  rights of the
Corporation and not publicly known. Except in connection with the performance of
his duties for the  Corporation  the Employee agrees that he will not, during or
at any time after the term of this  Agreement,  either  directly or  indirectly,
disclose  to any  person,  firm or  corporation  such  trade  secrets  or  other
confidential  information,  including,  but not limited to, any facts concerning
the systems, methods,  procedures or plans developed or used by the Corporation.
The  Employee  agrees to retain all such trade  secrets  and other  confidential
information in a fiduciary capacity for the sole benefit of the Corporation, its
successors and assigns. Upon termination of his employment by the Corporation or
at any time that the Corporation may so request,  the Employee will surrender to
the Corporation all non-public papers,  notes,  reports and other documents (and
all copies  thereof)  relating to the business of the  Corporation  which he may
then possess or have under his control.


                                      -10-


<PAGE>

                  7. For a period of two (2) years  following the  expiration or
earlier  termination of this Agreement and within a two hundred fifty (250) mile
radius of the New York City the Employee  shall not,  without the prior  written
consent of the Corporation, directly or indirectly:

                     (a) solicit any business for or from, or become  associated
with, as principal,  agent, employee,  consultant, or in any other capacity, any
person  who, or entity  which,  at the time of, or during the twelve (12) months
immediately  preceding such expiration or termination was in direct  competition
with the Corporation;

                     (b) become a principal,  agent,  employee,  consultant,  or
otherwise  become  associated  with any person who, or entity  which,  has taken
affirmative  action which would permit such entity or person to actually  engage
in direct competition with the Corporation.

                  8. The  provisions of Paragraphs 6 and 7 of this Agreement are
of a unique  nature and of  extraordinary  value and of such a character  that a
material breach of the provisions of either  Paragraphs 6 or 7 of this Agreement
by the Employee will result in irreparable  damage and injury to the Corporation
for which the Corporation  will not have any adequate remedy at law.  Therefore,
in the event that the  Employee  commits or threatens to commit any such breach,
the  Corporation  will have (a) the right and remedy to have the  provisions  of
Paragraphs 6 and 7 of this Agreement  specifically  enforced by any court having
equity jurisdiction, it being agreed


                                                       -11-
<PAGE>

that in any proceeding for an injunction, and upon any motion for a temporary or
permanent injunction, the Employee's ability to answer in damages shall not be a
bar or  interposed as a defense to the granting of such  injunction  and (b) the
right and remedy to require  the  Employee to account for and to pay over to the
Corporation all compensation,  profits, monies,  accruals,  increments and other
benefits  (hereinafter  referred to collectively  as the "Benefits")  derived or
received by him as a result of any transactions  constituting a breach of any of
the provisions of Paragraphs 6 and 7 of this Agreement,  and the Employee hereby
agrees to account for and pay over such Benefits to the Corporation. Each of the
rights and remedies  enumerated in (a) and (b) above shall be independent of the
other, and shall be severally  enforceable,  and all of such rights and remedies
shall be in  addition  to,  and not in lieu of, any other  rights  and  remedies
available to the Corporation under law or in equity.

                  9. In the event  that any  provision,  or any  portion  of any
provision,  of this  Agreement  shall be held to be void or  unenforceable,  the
remaining  provisions  of this  Agreement,  and  the  remaining  portion  of any
provision found void or unenforceable in part only, shall continue in full force
and effect.

                  10. The Employee  represents  and warrants that he has made no
commitment  of any kind  whatsoever  inconsistent  with the  provisions  of this
Agreement  and that he is under no  disability  of any kind to enter  into  this
Agreement and to perform all of his obligations hereunder.

                  11. This Agreement  shall inure to the benefit of and shall be
binding upon the parties  hereto and their  respective  successors and permitted
assigns.  This Agreement  being personal to the Employee,  cannot be assigned by
him.  This  Agreement  may be  assigned by the  Corporation  in the event and in
connection with a merger,  consolidation or sale of all or substantially  all of
the assets of the  corporation  provided that the assignee  agrees in writing to
assume all of the  obligations of the Corporation  under this Agreement.  Prompt
written notice of such  assignment  shall be provided by the  Corporation to the
Employee.

                  12. Any dispute or controversy between the parties relating to
or arising out of this Agreement or any amendment or  modification  hereof shall
be determined by the Supreme  Court,  County of Nassau,  State of New York.  The
service of any notice,  process,  motion or other document in connection with an
action under this Agreement may be effectuated by either personal service upon a
party or by  certified  mail duly  addressed  to him at his address set forth on
page 1 hereof.

                  13. Unless  otherwise  required by law, the Corporation  shall
not recognize any  assignment,  transfer,  pledge,  hypothecation,  execution or
attachment of any amount or part thereof which becomes payable hereunder.

                  14. Any notice or  communication  required or  permitted to be
given  hereunder  shall be deemed duly given if delivered  personally or sent by
registered or certified mail,  return receipt  requested,  to the address of the
intended recipient as herein set


                                      -13-

forth or to such other  address as a party may  theretofore  have  specified  in
writing to the other. Any notice or  communication  intended for the Corporation
shall be addressed to the attention of its Board of Directors.

                  15.  A  waiver  of  any  breach  or  violation  of  any  term,
provision,  agreement,  covenant,  or condition  herein  contained  shall not be
deemed to be a  continuing  waiver or a waiver of any  future or past  breach or
violation.

                  16.  This  Agreement  constitutes  the  entire  agreement  and
understanding  between the Corporation and the Employee relating to the latter's
employment,  supersedes any prior agreement between the parties relating to such
matter, shall be governed by and construed


                                      -14-

in  accordance  with the laws of the  State of New York and may not be  changed,

hands as of the day and year first above written.

                                 April 16, 1996

To:      Martin Brownstein
         383 West John Street
         Hicksville, New York  11802

                  We are pleased to inform you that on April 15, 1996, the Stock
Option  Committee  of the Board of Directors of Uniflex,  Inc.  (the  "Company")
granted you an  incentive  stock  option  pursuant to the  Company's  1993 Stock
Option Plan (the "Plan"),  to purchase  10,000  shares (the  "Shares") of Common
Stock, par value $.10 per share, of the Company, at a price of $8.25 per Share.

                  This  option may be  exercised  prior to January  31, 2002 (on
which date the option will, to the extent not previously  exercised,  expire) as
follows:  (i) as to one-third the number of Shares on or after  February 1, 1997
and prior to January 31, 2000,  (ii) as to one-third  the number of Shares on or
after  February  1,  1998 and  prior to  January  31,  2001 and  (iii) as to the
remaining  one-third  of the number of Shares on or after  February  1, 1999 and
prior to January 31, 2002.  You must  purchase a minimum of 100 Shares each time
you choose to purchase  Shares,  except to purchase all of the remaining  Shares
available to you.

                  This option is issued in accordance with and is subject to and
conditioned upon all of the terms and conditions of the Plan (a copy of which in
its present form is attached  hereto),  as from time to time amended,  provided,
however, that no future amendment or termination of the Plan shall, without your
consent,  alter or impair any of your rights or  obligations  under this option.
Reference  is made to the terms  and  conditions  of the Plan,  all of which are
incorporated by reference in this option agreement as if fully set forth herein.

                  Unless  at  the  time  of  the   exercise  of  this  option  a
registration statement under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the "Act"),
is in effect as to such Shares, any Shares purchased by you upon the exercise of
this option shall be acquired for investment  and not for sale or  distribution,
and if the Company so requests, upon any exercise of this option, in whole or in
part,  you will execute and deliver to the Company a certificate to such effect.
The Company shall not be obligated to issue any Shares


<PAGE>
pursuant to this option if, in the opinion of counsel to the Company, the Shares
to be so issued are required to be registered or otherwise  qualified  under the
Act or under any other applicable statute, regulation or ordinance affecting the
sale of  securities,  unless and until such  Shares have been so  registered  or
otherwise qualified.

                  You  understand  and  acknowledge  that,  under  existing law,
unless at the time of the exercise of this option a registration statement under
the Act is in effect as to such  Shares  (i) any  Shares  purchased  by you upon
exercise  of this option may be  required  to be held  indefinitely  unless such
Shares  are  subsequently  registered  under the Act or an  exemption  from such
registration  is available;  (ii) any sales of such Shares made in reliance upon
Rule 144 promulgated under the Act may be made only in accordance with the terms
and conditions of that Rule (which,  under certain  circumstances,  restrict the
number of shares  which may be sold and the manner in which shares may be sold);
(iii) in the case of securities to which Rule 144 is not applicable,  compliance
with Regulation A promulgated  under the Act or some other disclosure  exemption
will be required;  (iv)  certificates  for Shares to be issued to you  hereunder
shall bear a legend to the effect that the Shares have not been registered under
the Act  and  that  the  Shares  may  not be  sold,  hypothecated  or  otherwise
transferred in the absence of an effective  registration statement under the Act
relating thereto or an opinion of counsel  satisfactory to the Company that such
registration  is not required;  (v) the Company will place an appropriate  "stop
transfer"  order with its transfer  agent with respect to such Shares;  and (vi)
the Company has  undertaken  no  obligation to register the Shares or to include
the Shares in any registration  statement which may be filed by it subsequent to
the issuance of the shares to you. In addition,  you understand and  acknowledge
that the Company has no  obligation to you to furnish  information  necessary to
enable you to make sales under Rule 144.

                  This option (or  installment  thereof) is to be  exercised  by
delivering  to the Company a written  notice of  exercise  in the form  attached
hereto as Exhibit A,  specifying the number of Shares to be purchased,  together
with payment of the purchase  price of the Shares to be purchased.  The purchase
price is to be paid in cash or, at the discretion of the Stock Option Committee,
by delivering  shares of the  Company's  stock already owned by you and having a
fair market  value on the date of exercise  equal to the  exercise  price of the
option,  or a  combination  of such shares and cash,  or otherwise in accordance
with the Plan.
