                                 Part I


Item 1.   Business

         United  Dominion  Realty  Trust,  Inc., a Virginia corporation, and its
subsidiaries (collectively, the "Company") is a self-administered equity real
estate  investment  trust ("REIT"), formed in 1972, whose business is devoted to
one industry segment, the ownership and operation of income-producing real
estate, primarily  apartment communities located in the southeastern U.S. (the
"Southeast"). The Company is headquartered in Richmond, Virginia with divisional
offices in Richmond, Atlanta, Georgia, and Orlando, Florida, and regional
offices in the previously mentioned cities plus Columbia, Maryland, Raleigh,
North Carolina, and Nashville, Tennessee. The Company has approximately 1,100
associates as of March 15, 1996. The Company is a fully  integrated real estate
company with acquisition,  development and asset and property  management
capabilities. The Company  acquires,  upgrades and operates its  properties
with the goals of maximizing  its funds from  operations  ("FFO")  (defined as
income before gains [losses] on investments  and  extraordinary  items
[computed in accordance with generally accepted accounting  principles] plus
real estate  depreciation,  less preferred dividends and after adjustment for
significant  nonrecurring items, if any)  and  quarterly  distributions  to
shareholders,   while  building  equity primarily through real estate
appreciation.

         At the beginning of 1991, the Company  embarked on a major expansion of
its apartment portfolio in an effort to take advantage of unique buying
opportunities resulting from the real estate credit crisis. This enabled the
Company to (i) acquire more stable apartment properties having high occupancy
levels and not requiring substantial renovation, and (ii) enter into new markets
including the Baltimore/Washington area, central and south Florida, Nashville
and Memphis, Tennessee.  The Company's acquisition strategy focuses on acquiring
two types of apartment communities: (i) near Class A properties built since 1980
where the investment (purchase price plus planned improvements) represents a
significant discount to replacement cost and (ii) well-located communities built
in the late 1960s or 1970s that can be upgraded and repositioned for the longer
term. In 1995, the Company purchased 23 apartment communities with 5,142
apartment homes for approximately $195 million. This includes 9 apartment
communities with 1,596 apartment  homes acquired in a portfolio  purchase for
$65.7 million,  including closing costs. As of March 15, 1996, the Company's
portfolio of income-producing real estate  consisted of 154 properties including
144 apartment complexes, 6 shopping centers, and 4 other properties. A
geographic distribution of the Company's portfolio of apartment  communities
held for investment is included in Item 2, "Properties".

         The Company is  operated  so as to qualify as a real estate  investment
trust under the applicable  provisions of the Internal  Revenue Code of 1986, as
amended (the  "Code").  To qualify,  the Company must meet certain  tests which,
among other things,  require that its assets  consist  primarily of real estate,
its  income  be  derived  primarily  from real  estate,  and at least 95% of its
taxable income be distributed to its shareholders. Because the Company qualifies
as a REIT, it is generally not subject to Federal income taxes.

         The  Company  manages its  properties  directly,  rather  than  through
outside property  management  firms.  During 1995, the cost of internal property
management of the Company's apartment properties was approximately 2.6% of rents
collected  versus the 4-5% fee typically  charged by independent  fee management
companies in the Company's  region.  In determining its cost of self management,
the Company considers all direct and indirect costs associated with the internal
property management function.

         Near the end of 1992,  management  of the Company  determined  that the
Company  should  devote  substantially  all of its  resources  to the  apartment
business.  During 1994, the Company sold one shopping center and during 1995 the
Company sold seven shopping centers. As of the end of 1995, six of the Company's
remaining  seven shopping  centers were under  contract to be sold.  There is no
assurance that these sales transactions will be consummated.  Although no formal
plans for  divestiture  have  been  made,  the  Company  hopes to  substantially
liquidate its commercial properties over time as opportunities arise.

         A significant aspect of the Company's  investment  strategy has been to
concentrate its  investments  within the Southeast.  The Company  currently owns
properties in the seven coastal  states from Delaware to Florida plus  Tennessee
and Alabama. This strategy of geographically focusing on one region, has enabled
management  to regularly  inspect each property and to monitor  developments  in
local real estate  markets.  The Company is a significant  apartment owner in 15
Southeast  markets  with each market  averaging  approximately  2,000  apartment
homes.  The  Company's  strategy is to establish a dominant  presence in each of
these markets in order to:



                                   3

<PAGE>



(bullet)   Be a local market leader.

(bullet)   Improve operating efficiencies in the purchase of good and services.

(bullet)   Reduce the cost of community management.

(bullet)   Generate new sources of revenue from services marketed
           to residents.

(bullet)   Reduce costs and add revenues from utility deregulation.

(bullet)   Build stronger local organizations which are conducive to
           growing and retaining associates.

         The Company will  continue to grow  principally  through  acquisitions.
However,  given its size, as well as its objective to be a dominant owner in its
larger markets, management believes that it is important that the Company have
some development capability. During 1995, the Company began building its
prototype apartment building as a second phase to Clear Run Apartments in
Wilmington, North Carolina. The Company plans to build this prototype as a
second phase at four other communities in 1996. The Company also plans to do a
ground up development of 360  apartment homes in a suburb of Nashville.

         As a qualified REIT, the Company  distributes a substantial  portion of
its  cash  flow to its  shareholders  in the  form of  dividends.  Over the past
several  years,  the  Company  has  reduced  its  payout  ratio  (the  ratio  of
distributions   declared  per  share  to  FFO  per  share)  from  above  90%  to
approximately  76% in 1995.  For 1995,  the Company's  cash flow from  operating
activities   exceeded  cash  distributions   paid  to  common   shareholders  by
approximately  $20.7  million.  The  Company  utilizes  a variety  of  primarily
external  financing sources to fund new acquisitions,  property  renovations and
expansions,  major capital  improvements and balloon debt payments.  The Company
has frequently  utilized its bank lines of credit to  temporarily  finance these
expenditures and has subsequently  replaced the short-term bank debt with longer
term debt or equity. During 1995 the Company recognized cash proceeds from sales
of real estate owned of $23.5 million.  Property  sales should  continue to be a
funding source in the future.

         During 1995 the Company  raised  approximately  $218  million
externally.  This included  $78.7 million from the sale of common stock in
February,  September and October  and  $101.5  million  from the April sale of
4,200,000  shares of 9 1/4% Series A Cumulative Redeemable Preferred  Stock ($25
per share liquidation  preference value) ("Preferred Stock"). Also during 1995,
the Company  completed new tax-exempt housing  bond  financings  or  assumed
such bond financings  and conventional mortgage notes in connection with certain
acquisitions in the aggregate  amount of approximately $38.0 million.

         In the past,  the Company  utilized fixed rate mortgage debt to finance
its growth.  As the Company's  capital base has broadened  over the past several
years  primarily  through  its sale of  common  stock in seven of the last  nine
years, its financial  strength and credit standing have improved.  The Company's
senior debt is currently rated BBB+ by Standard & Poor's and Baal by Moody's. As
a result of its investment grade debt ratings,  the Company has used and expects
to continue  to use  unsecured  debt as its primary  debt  funding  source.  The
Company also uses secured debt  financing  but to a much lesser  extent and only
(i) when such  financing  takes the form of tax-exempt  housing bonds or (ii) in
connection with an acquisition when existing mortgage financing is in place that
either is closed to prepayment or cannot be repaid at a reasonable cost.

         At December 31, 1995,  the Company had $70 million of revolving  credit
facilities with four commercial banks plus $33.5 million of additional available
lines of credit  with three of these  banks.  The  Company  will seek to further
expand these credit  arrangements during 1996. At December 31, 1995, the Company
had  $18.4  million  of  borrowings   outstanding  under  the  revolving  credit
facilities and no borrowings outstanding under its lines of credit.


                                       4

<PAGE>


         At the end of 1995,  the apartment  portion of the Company's  portfolio
included 141 complexes having a total of 34,224 apartment homes and constituting
95.8% of the Company's  real estate  owned,  at cost.  During 1995,  the Company
acquired 23 apartment  complexes,  having a total of 5,142  apartment  homes,  a
16.9% increase in the number of apartment  homes owned.  During 1995,  1994, and
1993,  apartments provided  approximately 96%, 93% and 89% respectively,  of the
Company's rental income. The Company's  apartment  communities consist primarily
of upper middle to moderate income  complexes which make up the broadest segment
of the apartment market.  Management believes that well located apartments offer
the Company a good  combination of current income and longer term equity growth.
Although  there is no known move  toward  rent  control in any of the markets in
which the  Company  now owns  apartments,  should rent  control  legislation  be
enacted,  the Company's  ability to raise rents to cover  increases in operating
expenses  might be impaired.  While the Company has been largely  unaffected  by
military  cutbacks and base  closures,  the effect of future defense cuts on the
Company's  region is unknown.  As the Company has expanded  beyond  Virginia and
North Carolina,  it has attempted to avoid markets where the exposure to reduced
defense  spending is believed to be high.  The Company has one property,  Indian
Hills in Anniston, Alabama, which caters to Fort McClellan which was included in
the list of  military  base  closings  announced  by the Defense  Department  in
February, 1995.

         Management  expects the Company's  apartment business to continue to be
stable during the next two to three years.  Apartment  markets in the Company's
region in 1994 and 1995 generally  benefitted from the combination of job growth
which led to strong  growth in the number of renter  households  and only modest
apartment construction.  Beginning in mid-year 1994 and lasting through mid-year
1995, physical occupancy of the Company's apartments steadily increased.
However, occupancy trended downward beginning in August, 1995 and continued to
decline albeit slowly through year end. Physical occupancy at the Company's
apartment properties averaged 93.9% for December, 1995. Management believes that
apartment markets within the Southeast will remain in balance over the next few
years if construction activity remains at 1994 and 1995 levels.  Because the
Company's apartment occupancy has stabilized at approximately 94% at the
beginning of 1996, it is anticipated that the Company will benefit more from
higher rent growth in 1996 and 1997 than from occupancy gains.

         It is widely believed by those who closely follow the industry that the
next few  years  will be a period of  consolidation  for  REITs.  Prior to 1990,
United   Dominion  was  the  only  major  publicly  held  REIT  focusing  almost
exclusively on apartment  investments.  Since then, a number of new  multifamily
REITs have been formed.  According to the  National  Association  of Real Estate
Investment  Trusts  (NAREIT),  there  were  more than 35  apartment  REITs as of
February 29, 1996. It is believed that some of these REITs may be forced to seek
to be acquired by larger,  better  capitalized REITs with superior access to the
capital markets,  such as the Company. If consolidation occurs, then the Company
expects to  participate in the process as an acquirer of other  apartment  REITs
when such  transactions  are accretive to FFO earnings and can enhance  dividend
growth and shareholder value.

         At  December  31,  1995,  commercial  properties,   primarily  shopping
centers,  constituted  the  remaining 4% of the  Company's  real estate owned at
cost. During 1995, 1994, and 1993,  commercial  properties  provided 4%, 7%, and
11%, respectively,  of the Company's rental income. The commercial portfolio has
become a non-material  portion of the  Company's total portfolio.

         In most of the Company's  markets,  the competition for residents among
properties is very intense.  Some  competing  properties are larger and/or newer
than the Company's  properties and offer features for prospective  residents not
offered by properties  owned by the Company.  The competitive  situation of each
property varies and intensifies as additional properties are constructed.

         The  Company  expects to continue to  aggressively  acquire  additional
apartment  properties within the Southeast during 1996. When it is in the market
for new  acquisitions,  the Company  competes  with  numerous  other  investors,
including  REITs,  individuals,   partnerships,   corporations,  pension  funds,
syndicators,  insurance  companies,  foreign  investors,  and other real  estate
entities.  Management  believes that the Company, in general, is well positioned
in terms of economic and other resources to compete effectively. Even though the
Company  has  certain  advantages  over some of its  competitors  because of its
substantial  presence  in the region and its access to capital,  some  competing
investors  are larger than the  Company in terms of assets and other  investment
resources and may have a competitive advantage.

         To date,  compliance  with  Federal,  State,  and  local  environmental
protection   regulations  has  not  had  a  material  effect  upon  the  capital
expenditures,  earnings,  or competitive position of the Company.  However, over
the past few years,  there have been increasing  concerns  raised  regarding the
presence of  asbestos  and other  hazardous  materials  in existing  real estate
properties.  In  response  to this,  on March 1,  1991,  the  Company  adopted a
property management plan for hazardous  materials.  As part of the plan, Phase I
environmental  site  investigation  and  reports  have been  completed  for each
property owned by the Company and not  previously  inspected.  In addition,  all
proposed acquisitions are inspected prior to acquisition. In general, within the
Company's  region,  owners of property for sale have been required by purchasers
to remove or  control  asbestos  and other  environmental  hazards  prior to the
transfer of the property. Consequently, when the Company sells properties in the
future,  management  anticipates  that the Company will similarly be required to
remove or control such hazards, if any. In some cases, the Company has abandoned
otherwise economically  attractive  acquisitions because the costs of removal or
control have been  prohibitive  and/or the Company has been  unwilling to accept
the potential risks  involved.  Management  believes that thorough  professional
environmental   inspections   and  testing  for  asbestos  and  other  hazardous
materials,  coupled with a conservative posture toward accepting known risk, the
Company  can  minimize  its  exposure to  potential  liability  associated  with
environmental  hazards. The Company is not aware of any environmental hazards on
or in its properties which  individually or in the aggregate may have a material
adverse  impact on its  operations  or  financial  position.  To the best of its
knowledge,  the Company is in compliance with all applicable environmental rules
and regulations.


                          UNITED DOMINION REALTY, L.P.


         On October 23, 1995, the Company organized United Dominion Realty, L.P.
(the "Partnership")  under the Virginia Revised Uniform Limited Partnership Act.
The Company is the sole General Partner of the Partnership and currently holds a
99% interest therein.  The remaining 1% is currently held by UDRT of North
Carolina,  L.L.C., a wholly owned  subsidiary of the Company.  In 1995, the
Company  acquired two  apartment  communities  and land to develop an additional
apartment  community using the Partnership, and transferred seven of its
Tennessee properties into the Partnership. The Partnership is intended to assist
the Company in competing for acquisitions of properties  that meet the Company's
investment  strategies from seller partnerships some or all of whose partners
may wish to defer  taxation  of gain  realized on sale  through an exchange of
partnership interests.

         The  Partnership  is  organized  under a  First  Amended  and  Restated
Agreement of Limited Partnership dated as of December 31, 1995 (the "Partnership
Agreement"). A summary of certain provisions of the Partnership Agreement is set
forth  below.  The summary does not purport to be complete and is subject to and
qualified  in  its  entirety  by  reference  to  applicable  provisions  of  the
Partnership  Act and the complete  Partnership  Agreement,  which is filed as an
exhibit to this annual report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 1995.

ADMISSION OF LIMITED PARTNERS; INVESTMENT AGREEMENTS

         The Company  presently intends to limit admission to the Partnership to
Limited Partners who are "accredited investors," as defined in Rule 501(a) under
the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the "Securities Act").  Limited Partners
will be admitted  upon  executing  and  delivering  to the Company an Investment
Agreement (the "Investment Agreement")

                                       6

<PAGE>


and delivering to the Partnership the consideration  prescribed  therein. In the
Investment  Agreement,  the prospective Limited Partner makes representations as
to his status as an accredited investor and other representations and agreements
regarding the Units, defined below, to be issued to him,  intended to assure
compliance with the Securities Act. Any rights to Securities Act registration of
the Common Stock of the Company, if any, issued to such Limited Partner upon
redemption of his Units (see "Redemption Rights" below), will also be set forth
in the Investment Agreement.

UNITS

         The interests in the Partnership of the Partnership's  limited Partners
(the  "Limited  Partners")  are  represented  by  units of  limited  partnership
interest  (the  "Units").  All  holders of Units are  entitled  to share in cash
distributions  from,  and  in  the  profits  and  losses  of,  the  Partnership.
Distributions by the Partnership are made equally for each Unit outstanding.  As
the   Partnership's   sole  General   Partner,   the  Company  intends  to  make
distributions  per Unit in the same  amount  as the cash  dividends  paid by the
Company  on each  share  of  Common  Stock.  However,  because  the  Partnership
properties,  which are the primary source of cash available for  distribution to
Unit holders,  are significantly  fewer than the properties held directly by the
Company  and  may  not  perform  as  well,   there  can  be  no  assurance  that
distributions  per Unit will always equal Common Stock  dividends  per share.  A
distribution  made to the Company to enable it to maintain  its REIT status (see
"Management and Operations"  below) may deplete cash otherwise  distributable to
Unit  holders.  The  Partnership  may borrow from the Company for the purpose of
equalizing  per  Unit  and per share of Common  Stock  distributions,  but
neither  the Partnership  nor the  Company  is under  any  obligation  regarding
Partnership borrowings for this or any other purpose.

         The Limited  Partners  have the rights to which  limited  partners  are
entitled  under  the  Partnership  Act.  The Units  are  illiquid;  they are not
registered for secondary sale under any securities laws,  state or federal,  and
cannot be  transferred by a holder unless they are so registered or an exemption
from such registration is available.  Neither the Partnership nor the Company is
under any  obligation to effect any such  registration  or to establish any such
exemption.  The Partnership  Agreement  imposes  additional  restrictions on the
transfer of Units, as described below under "Transferability of Interests."

MANAGEMENT AND OPERATIONS

         The Company, as the sole General Partner of the Partnership,  has full,
exclusive  and complete  responsibility  and  discretion in the  management  and
control of the  Partnership,  and the  Limited  Partners  have no  authority  to
transact business for, or participate in the management  activities or decisions
of, the Partnership.

         The Partnership  Agreement requires that the Partnership be operated in
a manner  that will enable the  Company to satisfy  the  requirements  for being
classified as a REIT and to avoid any federal income tax liability.  The General
Partner is expressly directed,  notwithstanding  anything to the contrary in the
Partnership Agreement, to cause the Partnership to distribute amounts (including
proceeds  of  Partnership  borrowings)  sufficient  to enable the Company to pay
distributions to its shareholders required to maintain its REIT status and avoid
income tax or excise tax liability.

ABILITY TO ENGAGE IN OTHER BUSINESSES; CONFLICTS OF INTEREST

         The  Company  and  other  persons   (including   officers,   directors,
employees,  agents and other affiliates of the Company) are not prohibited under
the Partnership Agreement from engaging in other business activities,  including
business  activities   substantially  similar  or  identical  to  those  of  the
Partnership,  and the  Company  will not be  required  to present  any  business
opportunities to the Partnership or to any Limited Partner.

BORROWING BY THE PARTNERSHIP

         The General Partner is authorized  under the  Partnership  Agreement to
cause the  Partnership  to borrow  money and to issue and  guarantee  debt as it
deems necessary for the conduct of the activities of the Partnership.  Such debt
may be secured by  mortgages,  deeds of  Company,  pledges or other liens on the
assets of the Partnership.

REIMBURSEMENT OF GENERAL PARTNER; TRANSACTIONS WITH THE GENERAL PARTNER AND ITS
AFFILIATES

         The General  Partner will receive no  compensation  for its services as
General Partner of the  Partnership.  However,  as a partner in the Partnership,
the  General  Partner has the same right to  allocations  of profit and loss and
distributions as other partners of the Partnership. In addition, the Partnership
will reimburse the General Partner for all expenses it incurs

                                       7

<PAGE>


relating  to the  ownership  and  operation  of,  or for  the  benefit  of,  the
Partnership and any offering of Units or other partnership interests, and for
the pro rata share of the expenses of any offering securities of the Company
some or all the proceeds of which are contributed to the Partnership.

LIABILITY OF GENERAL PARTNER AND LIMITED PARTNERS

         The  General  Partner  is liable  for all  general  obligations  of the
Partnership to the extent not paid by the  Partnership.  The General  Partner is
not liable for the non-recourse obligations of the Partnership.

         The  Limited   Partners  are  not  required  to  make  further  capital
contributions to the Partnership  after their respective  initial  contributions
are fully paid.  Assuming  that a Limited  Partner acts in  conformity  with the
provisions of the  Partnership  Agreement,  the liability of the Limited Partner
for  obligations  of  the  Partnership  under  the  Partnership   Agreement  and
Partnership Act will be limited, subject to certain possible exceptions,  to the
loss of the Limited Partner's investment in the Partnership.

         The Partnership is qualified to conduct business in each state in which
it owns  property  and may qualify to conduct  business in other  jurisdictions.
Maintenance  of limited  liability  may require  compliance  with certain  legal
requirements of those jurisdictions and certain other jurisdictions. Limitations
on  the  liability  of a  limited  partner  for  the  obligations  of a  limited
partnership have not clearly been established in many states. Accordingly, if it
were  determined  that the  right,  or  exercise  of the  right  by the  Limited
Partners,  to make certain  amendments to the  Partnership  Agreement or to take
other action pursuant to the Partnership  Agreement constituted "control" of the
Partnership's  business for the purposes of the statutes of any relevant  state,
the  Limited  Partners  might be held  personally  liable for the  Partnership's
obligations.  The Partnership will operate in a manner the General Partner deems
reasonable,  necessary and appropriate to preserve the limited  liability of the
Limited Partners.

EXCULPATION AND INDEMNIFICATION OF THE GENERAL PARTNER

         The Partnership  Agreement provides that the General Partner will incur
no liability for monetary  damages to the Partnership or any Limited Partner for
losses sustained or liabilities incurred as a result of errors in judgment or of
any act or omission if the General Partner acted in good faith. In addition, the
General  Partner is not responsible for any misconduct or negligence on the part
of its agents, provided the General Partner appointed such agents in good faith.

         The  Partnership  Agreement  also provides for  indemnification  of the
General Partner,  the directors,  officers and employees of the General Partner,
and such other persons as the General  Partner may from time to time  designate,
against any and all losses,  claims,  damages,  liabilities  (joint or several),
expenses  (including  reasonable  legal fees and  expenses),  judgments,  fines,
settlements,  and  other  amounts  arising  from  any and all  claims,  demands,
actions,  suits or  proceedings,  whether  civil,  criminal,  administrative  or
investigative,  that relate to the  operations of the  Partnership  in which any
such indemnitee may be involved,  or is threatened to be involved,  unless it is
established  that (i) the act or omission of such indemnitee was material to the
matter  giving rise to the  proceeding  and either was committed in bad faith or
was the  result of  active  and  deliberate  dishonesty,  (ii)  such  indemnitee
actually received an improper  personal benefit in money,  property or services,
or (iii) in the case of any criminal proceeding,  such indemnitee had reasonable
cause to believe that the act or omission was unlawful.

SALE OF ASSETS

         Under the Partnership Agreement,  the General Partner generally has the
exclusive  authority to determine whether,  when and on what terms the assets of
the Partnership will be sold.

REMOVAL OF THE GENERAL PARTNER; TRANSFER OF GENERAL PARTNER'S INTEREST

         The  Partnership  Agreement does not authorize the Limited  Partners to
remove the General Partner and the Limited  Partners have no right to remove the
General Partner under the Partnership  Act. The General Partner may not transfer
any of its interest as General Partner and withdraw as General  Partner,  except
(a) to a wholly-owned  subsidiary of the General Partner or the owner of all the
ownership  interests in the General Partner,  (b) in connection with a merger or
sale of all or substantially  all of the assets of the General Partner or (c) as
a result of the  bankruptcy of the General  Partner.  A substitute or additional
General Partner may be admitted upon  compliance with the applicable  provisions
of the Partnership Agreement,  including delivery by counsel for the Partnership
of an opinion that admission of such General Partner will not cause (i) the

                                       8

<PAGE>


Partnership to be classified  other than as a partnership for federal income tax
purposes,  or (ii) the loss of any  Limited  Partner's  limited  liability.  The
General Partner may not sell all or  substantially  all of its assets,  or enter
into  a  merger,  unless  the  sale  or  merger  includes  the  sale  of  all or
substantially  all of the assets of, or the merger of, the  Partnership  and the
Limited Partners receive for each Unit  substantially the same  consideration as
the holder of one share of Common Stock.

TRANSFERABILITY OF INTERESTS

         A Limited Partner may transfer his interest in the Partnership without
the  consent of the  General  Partner,  unless in the opinion of counsel for the
Partnership  such transfer would require the registration of such interest under
the Securities Act or would  otherwise  violate any applicable  federal or state
securities or blue sky law  (including  investment  suitability  standards)  and
unless such transfer would have undesirable  federal income tax consequences for
the  Partnership.  The  General  Partner  may  require,  as a  condition  of any
transfer, that the transferring Limited Partner assume all costs incurred by the
Partnership in connection with such transfer.

REDEMPTION RIGHTS

         Each Limited  Partner has the right (the  "Redemption  Right"), subject
to the purchase right of the General Partner described below, to cause the
redemption of such Limited  Partner's  Units for cash in an amount per Unit
equal to the  average of the  closing  sale  prices of the  Common  Stock of the
Company on the New York Stock  Exchange  (the  "NYSE") for the ten trading  days
immediately  preceding  the date of receipt by the General  Partner of notice of
such Limited Partner's  exercise of the Redemption Right. A Limited Partner that
exercises the Redemption Right shall be deemed to have offered to sell the Units
to be  redeemed  to the General  Partner,  and the General  Partner may elect to
purchase  such Units by paying to such  Limited  Partner  either the  redemption
price in cash or by  delivering  to such  Limited  Partner a number of shares of
Common  Stock of the  Company  equal to the product of the number of such Units,
multiplied  by the  "Conversion  Factor,"  which is 1.0,  subject  to  customary
antidilution  provisions in the event of stock  dividends on or  subdivisions or
combinations  of the Common  Stock  subsequent  to issuance  of such Units.  Any
Common Stock issued to the redeeming  Limited Partner will be listed on the NYSE
and if and to  the  extent  provided  in  such  Redeeming  Partner's  Investment
Agreement,  registered  under the  Securities  Act and/or  entitled to rights to
Securities Act registration.

NO WITHDRAWAL OF CAPITAL BY LIMITED PARTNERS

         No Limited  Partner has the right to  withdraw  any part of his capital
contribution  to the  Partnership  or to  interest  thereon  or to  receive  any
distribution, except as provided in the Partnership Agreement.

ISSUANCE OF ADDITIONAL LIMITED PARTNERSHIP INTERESTS AND OTHER PARTNERSHIP
SECURITIES

         The General  Partner is authorized,  without the consent of the Limited
Partners,   to  cause  the  Partnership  to  issue  additional  Units  or  other
Partnership  securities  to the  partners or to other  persons on such terms and
conditions and for such  consideration,  including cash or any property or other
assets permitted by the Partnership Act, as the General Partner deems
appropriate.

MEETINGS

         The  Partnership  Agreement does not provide for annual meetings of the
Limited  Partners,  and the General  Partner  does not  anticipate  calling such
meetings.

AMENDMENT OF PARTNERSHIP AGREEMENT

         Amendments to the Partnership  Agreement may, with four exceptions,  be
made by the General  Partner  without the consent of the Limited  Partners.  Any
amendment to the  Partnership  Agreement  which would (i) affect the  Conversion
Factor or the Redemption Rights of the Limited  Partners,  (ii) adversely affect
the rights of the  Limited  Partners  to receive  distributions  payable to them
under the Partnership  Agreement,  (iii) alter the Partnership's profit and loss
allocations  or (iv) impose any  obligation  upon the  Limited  Partners to make
additional capital contributions to the Partnership shall require the consent of
Limited  Partners  owning  more  than  50% of the  percentage  interests  in the
Partnership.


                                       9

<PAGE>


BOOKS AND REPORTS

         The General Partner is required to keep at the specified  office of the
Partnership  the  Partnership's  books  and  records,  including  copies  of the
Partnership's  federal,  state and local tax returns, a list of the partners and
their last known business addresses,  the Partnership Agreement, the Partnership
certificate  and all amendments  thereto and any other documents and information
required   under   Partnership   Act.   Any  partner  or  his  duly   authorized
representative,  upon  paying  duplicating,  collection  and mailing  costs,  is
entitled to inspect or copy such records during ordinary business hours.

         The General  Partner will furnish to each Limited  Partner,  as soon as
practicable  after the close of each fiscal year,  an annual  report  containing
financial  statements  of the  Partnership  (or  the  Company,  if  consolidated
financial  statements  including the  Partnership  are prepared) for such fiscal
year. The financial  statements  will be audited by accountants  selected by the
General  Partner.  In addition,  as soon as practicable  after the close of each
fiscal  quarter  (other than the last quarter of the fiscal  year),  the General
Partner  will  furnish to each  Limited  Partner a quarterly  report  containing
unaudited  financial  statements  of the  Partnership  (or the  Company  and the
Partnership, consolidated).

         The General  Partner will furnish to each  Limited  Partner,  within 75
days after the close of each fiscal year of the Partnership, the tax information
necessary to file such Limited Partner's individual tax returns.

LOANS TO PARTNERSHIP

         The Partnership  Agreement provides that the General Partner may borrow
additional  Partnership  funds  for any  Partnership  purpose  from the  General
Partner or a subsidiary or subsidiaries of the General Partner or otherwise.

ADJUSTMENTS OF CAPITAL ACCOUNTS AND PERCENTAGE INTERESTS

         A separate  capital account will be established and maintained for each
Partner.  If (i) a new or existing  general or limited partner of the
Partnership (a "Partner" or collectively "Partners")  acquires an additional
interest in the Partnership interest in exchange for more than a de minimis
capital contribution,  (ii) the Partnership  distributes  to  a  Partner  more
than  a de  minimis  amount  of Partnership property as consideration for a
Partnership interest,  or (iii) the Partnership is liquidated for federal income
tax purposes,  the General  Partner shall  revalue the  property  of the
Partnership to its fair market  value (as determined by the General  Partner, in
its sole discretion) in accordance with applicable  federal income tax
regulations.  When the Partnership's  property is revalued by the General
Partner,  the capital accounts of the partners shall be adjusted in  accordance
with such regulations,  which  generally  require such capital  accounts to be
adjusted to reflect the manner in which the  unrealized gain or loss  inherent
in such property  (that has not been  reflected  in the capital accounts
previously) would be allocated among the partners pursuant to the Partnership
Agreement if there were a taxable  disposition of such property for its fair
market value on the date of the revaluation.

         If the number of  outstanding  Units  increases or  decreases  during a
taxable year, each partner's  percentage  interest in the  Partnership  shall be
adjusted by the General Partner  effective as of the effective date of each such
increase or decrease to a  percentage  equal to the number of Units held by such
Partner divided by the aggregate number of Units outstanding after giving effect
to such  increase  or  decrease,  and  profits  and  losses for the year will be
allocated among the partners in a manner selected by the General Partner to give
appropriate effect to such adjustments.

REGISTRATION RIGHTS

         Limited  Partners have no rights to Securities Act  registration of any
Common Stock of the Company  received in  connection  with  redemption  of Units
except as provided in their respective Investment Agreements.

TAX MATTERS; PROFIT AND LOSS ALLOCATIONS

         Pursuant to the Partnership  Agreement,  the General Partner is the tax
matters partner of the Partnership and, as such, has the authority to handle tax
audits and to make tax elections under the Code on behalf of the Partnership.

         Profit and loss of the  Partnership  generally will be allocated  among
the Partners in accordance  with their  respective  interests in the Partnership
based on the number of Units held by the Partners.

DISTRIBUTIONS

         The  Partnership  Agreement  provides  that the General  Partner  shall
distribute cash quarterly,  in amounts  determined by the General Partner in its
sole discretion,  to the partners in accordance with their respective percentage
interests in the Partnership,  except that the amount of cash distributable to a
Limited  Partner  who has not been a Limited  Partner  for the full  quarter for
which  the  distribution  is  paid  is  subject  to  pro  rata  reduction.  Upon
liquidation  of the  Partnership,  after payment of, or adequate  provision for,
debts and  obligations  of the  Partnership,  including any Partner  loans,  any
remaining  assets of the  Partnership  will be  distributed to all Partners with
positive capital  accounts in accordance with their respective  positive capital
account  balances.  If the General Partner has a negative balance in its capital
account  following a  liquidation  of the  Partnership,  it will be obligated to
contribute cash to the Partnership  equal to the negative balance in its capital
account.

TERM

         The Partnership  will continue until December 31, 2051, or until sooner
dissolved upon (i) the bankruptcy, dissolution, death or withdrawal of a General
Partner  (unless  the Limited  Partners  elect to continue  the  Partnership  by
electing by unanimous  consent a substitute  General  Partner  within 90 days of
such  occurrence),  (ii)  the  passage  of 90  days  after  the  sale  or  other
disposition of all or substantially all the assets of the Partnership, (iii) the
redemption  of all  Limited  Partners'  interests  in the  Partnership,  or (iv)
election  by the General  Partner.  Upon  dissolution  of the  Partnership,  the
General  Partner  will proceed to liquidate  the assets of the  Partnership  and
distribute  the  proceeds  remaining  after  payment or adequate  provision  for
payment of all debts and  obligations  of the  Partnership  as  provided  in the
Partnership Agreement.

ITEM 7.  MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND
RESULTS OF OPERATION

FUNDS FROM  OPERATIONS  ("FFO") is defined as income  before  gains  (losses) on
investments  and  extraordinary  items  (computed in accordance  with  generally
accepted accounting  principles) plus real estate  depreciation,  less preferred
dividends and after adjustment for significant  non-recurring items, if any. The
Company  considers FFO in  evaluating  property  acquisitions  and its operating
performance,  and believes that FFO should be considered  along with, but not as
an  alternative  to, net  income  and cash  flows as a measure of the  Company's
operating performance and liquidity.  FFO does not represent cash generated from
operating activities in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles
and is not necessarily indicative of cash available to fund cash needs.

For 1995, the Company  implemented a revised  definition of FFO and has restated
FFO for prior years to conform to the recommendations set forth in a White Paper
adopted by NAREIT (The National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts) at
the beginning of the year. The impact of adopting the NAREIT recommendations was
to reduce FFO for 1995,  1994 and 1993 by $1.1  million,  $915,000 and $855,000,
respectively.

RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 1995

For 1995, the Company reported significant increases over 1994 in rental income,
income from property operations, income before gains (losses) on investments and
extraordinary  items,  net  income  and FFO.  Net  income  available  to  common
shareholders increased $7.4 million or $.09 per share over 1994. During 1994 and
1995, the Company  acquired a total of 16,308 apartment homes in 67 communities,
net  of  properties  resold,  representing  a 91%  expansion  in the  number  of
apartment   homes  owned  during  that  period.   These   apartment  homes  (the
"non-mature"  communities)  provided  a  substantial  portion  of the  aggregate
reported  increases  noted  above.  However,  the  improved  performance  of the
Company's mature group of 17,916 apartment homes in the 74 communities  acquired
prior to 1994 (the "mature"  communities)  also  contributed  to the  increases,
particularly when considered on a per share basis.

For 1995, the Company's mature  communities  provided  approximately  53% of the
Company's  rental income and 52% of its net operating income (rental income less
rental  expenses).  Total rental income from these apartment homes grew 5.0%, or
$4.9 million in 1995, reflecting an increase in economic occupancy to 94.8% from
94.1% for  1994,  and  growth in  average  rents and other  income of 4.4%.  The
improvement in occupancy  reflected  stronger  apartment markets  throughout the
Company's  region.  Occupancy  peaked in mid-1994 and remained above 95% through
mid-1995 before trending downward slighty in the second half of the year. Rental
expenses at these  communities  increased 2.6%, or $1.1 million,  resulting in a
decrease in the operating  expense ratio (the ratio of rental expenses to rental
income) of 1.0% to 42.9%.  The increase in rental expenses  reflected  increased
repairs, real estate taxes and exterior painting expenses.  These increases were
offset somewhat by lower gas,  property  management,  and  promotional  expenses
caused  primarily by the combination of stronger  occupancy and  efficiencies of
size.  As  a  result  of  an  Internal  Revenue  Service  examination,  property
management  expenses  for  the  1995  period  include  a  $395,000  payment  for
employment and other taxes associated with employee occupied apartment homes for
the 1993 and 1994 tax years. In 1995, the Company was able to internally  manage
its  mature  apartment  communities  at a cost of  approximately  2.6% of rental
income versus 3.4% in 1994.  This  reduction was achieved  through  economies of
scale,  as the Company  acquired a significant  number of apartment  communities
over the past two years without a corresponding  increase in property management
costs.  Turnover  (measured by move-outs) was 60% at the mature  communities for
1995 versus 59% in 1994. The  combination of increased  occupancy,  higher rents
and  only a  moderate  operating  expense  increase  led to an  increase  in net
operating income from mature communities of approximately $3.8 million or 6.9%.

For the 16,308  apartments in the 67 non-mature  communities,  average occupancy
was  93.1%  and the  operating  expense  ratio  was  41.3%  during  1995.  These
communities  provided  increases  of $52.1  million,  $21.6  million  and  $30.5
million,  respectively, in rental income, rental expenses excluding depreciation
expense,  and net operating  income.  For the 34,224  apartment homes in the 141
communities  owned on  December  31,  1995,  occupancy  averaged  94.0%  and the
operating  expense ratio was 42.2% for the full year 1995.  For 1994, the 29,282
apartment  homes then owned had occupancy of 93.7% and an expense ratio of 43.2%
for that year. For 1995, rental income, rental expenses excluding  depreciation
expense,  net operating income and real estate depreciation from commercial
properties decreased $1.8 million, $370,000, $1.4 million and $741,000,
respectively since 1994,  primarily due to the sales of eight shopping centers
over the past two years.

For 1995,  depreciation  of real  estate  owned  increased  $10.2  million  with
substantially all of the increase  attributable to the portfolio  expansion that
occured during 1994 and 1995.

For 1995, interest expense increased  approximately $12.1 million over 1994. The
Company used both debt and equity to finance its growth over the past two years;
however, the weighted average amount of debt employed was higher in 1995 than it
was in 1994 ($512  million in 1995  versus $392  million in 1994).  The $.15 per
share  increase in interest  expense  reflected  this higher  average  amount of
outstanding  debt in 1995  together  with an  increase in the  weighted  average
interest rate on this debt from 7.3% in 1994 to 7.9% in 1995.  The rate increase
reflected  the  Company's   heavier  reliance  on  lower  rate  short-term  bank
borrowings  in 1994 than in 1995 ($33.8  million in 1994 versus $8.2  million in
1995).

General and administrative  expenses were relatively flat in 1995, increasing by
only $62,000 over 1994. General and  administrative  expense for 1994 included a
$450,000 charge related to the adoption of SFAS No. 112, "Employers'  Accounting
for Postemployment Benefits". In 1995, the Company incurred increases in most of
its general and  administrative  expense  categories with the largest percentage
increase  attributable  to costs  related to abandoned  acquisitions,  including
$204,000  associated  with an  unsuccessful  business  combination  with another
apartment company.

During  1995,  the  Company  sold  seven  shopping  centers  and  two  apartment
communities and recognized gains for financial  reporting purposes totaling $5.1
million.  Four of the  shopping  centers  were sold to First  Washington  Realty
Trust, Inc. on June 30, 1995. In connection with the sales, the Company received
cash  and  358,000  shares  of First  Washington's  9.75%  Series  A  Cumulative
Participating Convertible Preferred Stock having a fair value of $7.7 million on
the date of  sale.  Five of the  shopping  center  sales  during  the year  were
structured  to qualify as tax deferred  exchanges  which  enabled the Company to
defer  approximately $4.5 million of capital gains for income tax purposes.  The
Company also sold two apartment communities, both of which were acquired as part
of the Clover Portfolio in 1994. No significant book gain or loss was recognized
on the sale of either property.

In  March,  1995,  the  FASB  issued  Statement  No.  121,  "Accounting  for the
Impairment of Long-Lived  Assets and for  Long-Lived  Assets to be Disposed of,"
which requires  impairment losses to be recognized for long-lived assets used in
operations   when  indicators  of  impairment  are  present  and  the  estimated
undiscounted future cash flows are not sufficient to recover the assets carrying
value.  The  statement   requires  that  impairment  losses  be  recognized  for
long-lived  assets to be disposed of when the fair value of the asset,  less the
estimated  cost to sell, is less than the carrying  value of that asset measured
at the time management commits to the sale or disposal.  On October 1, 1995, the
Company  opted  for the early  adoption  of  Statement  No.  121.  At the end of
October,  1995,  the Company  executed a letter of intent to sell five  shopping
centers in a bulk sale at an aggregate purchase price of $28.4 million.  Closing
is  expected  to  occur  in the  first  half of  1996.  Based  on a  preliminary
allocation of the sales price, the Company  recognized a $1.7 million impairment
loss associated with the disposition of one of these centers, Village Square, in
Myrtle Beach, South Carolina.  The other four centers are expected to be sold at
modest  gains.  At December 31, 1995,  an  additional  shopping  center plus six
apartment  communities  were under contracts or letters of intent to sell. These
twelve  properties  are  classified on the  consolidated  balance sheet as "Real
estate held for disposition" in the amount of $51.0 million,  net of accumulated
depreciation  and  impairment  loss  valuation  allowance.  Real estate held for
disposition  contributed  income from property  operations of approximately $4.1
million for the year ended December 31, 1995.

YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 1994

For 1994, the Company reported significant increases over 1993 in rental income,
income from property operations, income before gains (losses) on investments and
extraordinary item, net income and funds from operations.  During 1993 and 1994,
the  Company  acquired  15,450   apartment  units  (63  apartment   communities)
representing a 112% expansion in the number of apartment homes owned during that
two year period. These additional apartment homes provided a substantial portion
of the reported increases noted above. However, the improved performance of the
Company's  mature group of 13,832  apartment  homes (57  apartment  communities)
acquired  prior to 1993 also  contributed to the  increases,  particularly  when
considered on a per share basis.

For 1994, the Company's mature apartment communities provided  approximately 53%
of the Company's rental income and 51% of its net operating income. Total rental
income from these apartment homes grew 6.2%, or $4.3 million in 1994, reflecting
an increase  in  economic  occupancy  to 94.3%  compared to 91.6% for 1993,  and
growth in average rents and other income of 3.3%.  The  improvement in occupancy
reflected  stronger  apartment markets  throughout the Company's region.  Rental
expenses  at these  properties  increased  2.3%  resulting  in a decrease in the
operating  expense ratio (the ratio of rental expenses to rental income) of 1.7%
to 44.0%.  The increase in rental  expenses was moderated by lower  advertising,
rental  promotions,  electricity,  and interior  painting and cleaning  expenses
caused by the  combination  of stronger  occupancy  and lower  tenant  turnover.
Turnover was 57% for 1994. The combination of increased occupancy,  higher rents
and  only a  moderate  operating  expense  increase  led to an  increase  in net
operating income from these mature apartment homes of approximately $3.6 million
or 9.5%.

For the  15,450  apartments  in the 63  apartment  communities  acquired  by the
Company  since  the  beginning  of 1993,  average  occupancy  was  92.8% and the
operating  expense  ratio was 43.1%  during  1994.  These  communities  provided
increases of $46.2 million,  $19.9 million and $26.3 million,  respectively,  in
rental income, rental expenses excluding  depreciation expense and net operating
income.  For the 29,282 apartment homes in the 120 communities owned on December
31, 1994, occupancy averaged 93.7% and the operating expense ratio was 43.6% for
the full  year  1994.  For 1993,  the  17,914  apartment  homes  then  owned had
occupancy of 91.5% and an expense ratio of 45.5% for that year. For 1994, rental
income, rental expenses excluding  depreciation expense and net operating income
from  commercial   properties   increased   $351,000,   $130,000  and  $221,000,
respectively.

For  1994,  depreciation  of real  estate  owned  increased  $9.2  million  with
substantially all of the increase  attributable to the portfolio  expansion that
occurred during 1993 and 1994.  Interest expense increased  approximately  $11.4
million in 1994 over 1993.  The Company used both debt and equity to finance its
growth during the two year period;  however, the Company used more debt relative
to equity in 1994 than it did in 1993.  The  increase  in  interest  expense  of
approximately  $.17 per share also reflects the rising interest rate environment
of 1994 when rates were generally higher than in 1993.

General and  administrative  expenses  increased  by $1.5  million or 43% during
1994. In January, 1994, the Company adopted SFAS No. 112, "Employers' Accounting
for Postemployment Benefits" and incurred a $450,000 charge to expense. In 1994,
the Company incurred increases in most of its general and administrative expense
categories.  The largest  percentage  increase  related to employee  payroll and
related employee  overhead costs which resulted from the significant  growth the
Company experienced during 1994.

LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES

As a qualified REIT, the Company  distributes a substantial  portion of its cash
flow to its shareholders in the form of dividends.  Over the past few years, the
Company has reduced its payout ratio (the ratio of common dividends declared per
share to FFO)  from  above 96% in 1992 to 76% for 1995.  The  Company  presently
intends to continue to reduce its payout ratio over the next few years to 70% or
below,  which  allows  for the  retention  of  sufficient  cash to cover  normal
operating  needs,  including  routine  replacements  and to help fund additional
acquisitions.  For 1995,  the  Company's  cash flow  from  operating  activities
exceeded cash distributions paid to common  shareholders by approximately  $20.7
million.  The Company utilizes a variety of primarily external financing sources
to fund portfolio growth,  major capital  improvement  programs and balloon debt
payments.  The  Company  has  frequently  utilized  its bank  lines of credit to
temporarily  finance  these  expenditures  and has  subsequently  replaced  this
short-term bank debt with longer term debt or equity. The Company has, from time
to time, used derivative  instruments to  synthetically  alter  on-balance sheet
liabilities or to hedge anticipated financing transactions. Derivative contracts
did not have a material  impact on results of  operations  during the three year
period ended December 31, 1995.

At the beginning of 1995, the Company had approximately $7.3 million of cash and
cash equivalents and $89.4 million of available and unused bank lines of credit.

For 1995,  the Company's  cash flow from operating  activities  increased  $11.9
million over the same period last year, primarily as a result of the significant
expansion of the Company's  portfolio as discussed  below and under  "Results of
Operations".

During 1995,  net cash used for investing  activities  was $183.9  million which
resulted  primarily from the Company's  acquisition of 23 apartment  communities
containing  5,142 apartment homes and several parcels of undeveloped  land for a
total cost of $198.1 million,  which includes $24.1 million of mortgage and bond
indebtedness  assumed in these  transactions.  The  Company  also  funded  $35.6
million of capital improvements to its properties during the year. This includes
$10.5 million of improvements at the Company's  17,916 mature  apartment  homes.
Excluding 11 communities that were acquired in the latter part of 1993 and which
still were  undergoing  rehabilitation  in 1995,  the  remaining  15,220  mature
apartment  homes  averaged  $424 in  capital  expenditures.  This  includes  the
following: carpet and tile replacements ($141/unit), appliances ($48/unit), HVAC
equipment ($33/unit), various interior improvements ($50/unit), various exterior
improvements including new roofs ($89/unit), various land improvements including
parking  lots  and site  lighting  ($31/unit)  and  various  other  improvements
($32/unit).  The Company also  received net cash  proceeds of $23.5 million from
the sale of real estate owned during 1995 and payments  aggregating $2.2 million
on mortgage notes receivable.

Net cash provided by financing  activities during 1995 was approximately  $113.1
million  reflecting  (i) the sale of common and preferred  stock during the year
netting  approximately  $181.1  million,  (ii) net proceeds from the issuance of
mortgage notes payable and notes payable of approximately  $31.3 million,  (iii)
net  short-term  bank  borrowings of $4.25  million and (iv) mortgage  financing
proceeds  released from construction  funds of $2.5 million.  These cash inflows
were partially offset by (i) $50.4 million of cash  distributions paid to common
and preferred  shareholders,  (ii) scheduled mortgage principal payments of $1.9
million,  and (iii)  payments  on notes  and  non-scheduled  mortgage  principal
payments of $53.7 million.  In February,  1995 the Company sold 1,360,000 shares
of its common stock to a group of  institutional  investors at a price of $131/8
per share.  Net proceeds of $17.8 million were used to curtail then  outstanding
bank debt. In April, 1995, the Company sold 4,200,000 shares of 91/4% Cumulative
Redeemable  Preferred Stock ($25 per share liquidation  preference  value).  Net
proceeds of the offering after  deducting  underwriting  commissions  and direct
offering costs aggregated  approximately  $101.5 million, of which approximately
$33.1  million was used to repay then  outstanding  bank debt and  approximately
$65.7 million was used to acquire a portfolio of nine apartment communities. The
remaining net proceeds  were  temporarily  invested in  short-term  money market
instruments   and  were   subsequently   used  to  fund   additional   apartment
acquisitions.  In September and October,  1995, the Company sold an aggregate of
4,550,000  shares of common stock in a public offering at $14.25 per share.  Net
proceeds of the offering,  after deducting  underwriting  commissions and direct
offering costs, aggregated approximately $61 million. Proceeds from the offering
were used to repay  $26.8  million of then  existing  bank debt.  The  remaining
proceeds were temporarily  invested in short-term  money market  instruments and
subsequently  used to purchase  additional  apartment  communities.  Also during
1995, the Company completed new tax-exempt  multifamily  housing bond financings
or assumed such bond  financings and  conventional  mortgage notes in connection
with  certain  acquisitions  in the  aggregate  amount  of  approximately  $45.4
million.

The Company  considers its cash provided by operating  activities to be adequate
to meet  operating  requirements  and  payments  of  distributions.  The Company
expects to acquire  5,000 to 7,000  apartment  homes during 1996 at an estimated
cost of $35,000 to $40,000 per apartment home.  While the Company used primarily
equity,  both preferred and common, to fund its acquisition program during 1995,
it anticipates that it will use a combination of equity,  debt and proceeds from
property sales to fund its 1996 acquisitions.  During the first half of 1996 the
Company  plans to  implement a  medium-term  note  program  which is expected to
include an initial $50 million 7-10 year issue.  In November,  1995, the Company
entered into a treasury rate lock  transaction  which had the effect of fixing a
10-year  Treasury rate  beginning  March 1, 1996 at 5.946%.  This  agreement was
terminated  on February 20, 1996 at no gain or loss to the Company.  The Company
anticipates a second medium-term note issue around mid-July,  1996 in the amount
of $50  million,  primarily  to repay a then  maturing  $35 million  senior note
issue. In July, 1995, the Company executed a forward starting interest rate swap
with a  notional  amount  of $50  million  which had the  effect  of fixing  the
interest rate on a 10-year Treasury starting July 15, 1996 at 6.544%.  Including
the $35 million loan, the Company has aggregate  debt  maturities of $47 million
in 1996. The maturing debt has a weighted average  interest rate of 9.26%.  When
this hedge transaction was executed,  it was intended to fix a rate on 7-10 year
debt at approximately  7.5% which is  approximately  170 basis points lower than
the weighted average interest rate on the maturing debt to be refinanced.  At
December 31, 1995, the Company had an aggregate  unrealized loss on these
derivative  instruments of approximately $4 million,  which  includes  $1.4
million  relating  to the rate  lock  agreement terminated on February 20, 1996
at no gain or loss.

The Company  currently has six shopping  centers and six  apartment  communities
under contracts or letters of intent to sell. These sales are scheduled to occur
during the first half of 1996 and will  generate  approximately  $63  million of
cash proceeds. Three of these properties are encumbered with an aggregate amount
of  approximately  $7.9 million of secured debt. If all twelve sales occur,  the
Company  will  recognize  an aggregate  gain of  approximately  $8.5 million for
financial reporting purposes. For income tax purposes,  several of the sales are
expected to be  structured  as tax deferred  exchanges.  The proceeds from these
property dispositions will be used to purchase apartment communities.  There are
no assurances that any of these sales transactions will be consummated.

Depending  upon the volume  and  timing of  acquisition  activity,  the  Company
anticipates  raising equity capital during the middle of the year through both a
public offering and private placements.

The  Company's  liquidity  and capital  resources  are  believed to be more than
adequate to meet its cash  requirements  for the next several years. The Company
expects to meet its  long-term  liquidity  requirements,  such as  balloon  debt
maturities, property acquisitions and significant capital improvements primarily
through the issuance of capital  stock and the  issuance of long-term  unsecured
notes  payable.  The Company will also rely upon (i) the  assumption of mortgage
indebtedness,  (ii) property  sales,  (iii)  distributions  reinvested  and cash
reinvested through the Company's  Dividend  Reinvestment and Stock Purchase Plan
and (iv) retained cash flow to meet its cash requirements.

INFLATION

Management  believes  that the direct  effects  of  inflation  on the  Company's
operations have been inconsequential.

Report of Ernst & Young LLP,  Independent Auditors

The Board of Directors and Shareholders
United Dominion Realty Trust, Inc.

We have audited the accompanying  consolidated balance sheets of United Dominion
Realty Trust,  Inc. and subsidiaries (the "Company") as of December 31, 1995 and
1994,  and the related  consolidated  statements  of  operations,  shareholders'
equity,  and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December
31, 1995.  Our audits also included the financial statement schedule listed in
the Index at Item 14(a). These financial  statements and schedule are the
responsibility  of the Company's management.  Our  responsibility  is to express
an  opinion on these  financial statements and schedule based on our audits.

We  conducted  our  audits  in  accordance  with  generally   accepted  auditing
standards.  Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material
misstatement.  An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting
the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements.  An audit also includes
assessing the  accounting  principles  used and  significant  estimates  made by
management,  as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation.
We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.

In our opinion,  the financial  statements  referred to above present fairly, in
all material  respects,  the consolidated  financial position of United Dominion
Realty  Trust,  Inc. and  subsidiaries  at December  31, 1995 and 1994,  and the
consolidated  results of their  operations  and their cash flows for each of the
three years in the period ended December 31, 1995, in conformity  with generally
accepted  accounting  principles. Also, in our opinion, the related financial
statement schedule, when considered in relation to the basic financial
statements taken as a whole, presents fairly in all material respects the
information set forth therein.

As  discussed  in Note 1 to the  consolidated financial  statements,  in 1995
the Company changed its method of accounting for impairment of long-lived assets
and long-lived assets held for disposition.

                       UNITED DOMINION REALTY TRUST, INC.
                   NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

1. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

ORGANIZATION  United Dominion Realty Trust, Inc. (the "Company"), a Virginia
corporation, is an owner-operator of income producing real estate, primarily
multifamily apartment communities in the mid-Atlantic and Southeastern, U.S.

BASIS OF PRESENTATION The accompanying consolidated financial statements include
the accounts of the Company and its wholly owned  subsidiaries.  All significant
inter-company accounts and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation.

USE OF ESTIMATES The preparation of the financial  statements in conformity with
generally accepted  accounting  principles requires management to make estimates
and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and
accompanying notes. Actual results could differ from those estimates.

FEDERAL INCOME TAXES The Company is operated as and annually  elects to be taxed
as a real estate  investment  trust under the Internal  Revenue Code of 1986, as
amended (the "Code").  Generally, a real estate investment trust, which complies
with the  provisions  of the Code and  distributes  at least 95% of its  taxable
income to its shareholders, does not pay federal income taxes on its distributed
income. Accordingly, no provision has been made for federal income taxes.

CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS All highly liquid investments with maturities of three
months or less, when purchased, are considered to be cash equivalents.

REAL ESTATE ASSETS AND  DEPRECIATION On October 1, 1995, the Company adopted the
provisions  of  Statement  of Financial  Accounting  Standards  ("SFAS") No. 121
"Accounting for the Impairment of Long-Lived Assets and for Long-Lived Assets to
be Disposed of." The statement  requires  impairment losses to be recognized for
long-lived  assets used in operations  when indicators of impairment are present
and the undiscounted future cash flows are not sufficient to recover the assets,
carrying value. If such indicators are present, an impairment loss is recognized
based on the excess of the carrying  amount of the impaired  asset over its fair
value.

For long-lived  assets to be disposed of,  impairment losses are recognized when
the fair value of the asset,  less the estimated  cost to sell, is less than the
carrying value of the asset measured at the time management commits to a plan to
dispose of the asset.  Assets are  classified  as assets to be  disposed of when
management has committed to sell and is actively marketing the property.  Assets
to be disposed of are carried at the lower of carrying  value or fair value less
cost to dispose,  determined  on an asset by asset  basis.  Depreciation  is not
recorded   during  the  period  in  which  assets  are  held  for  disposal  and
gains(losses)  from initial and subsequent  adjustments to the carrying value of
the  assets,  if any,  are  recorded  as a  separate  component  of income  from
continuing  operations.  Real estate  assets held for  disposition  are reported
separately on the consolidated  balance sheet,  net of accumulated  depreciation
and impairment loss valuation allowance.

Ordinary  repairs and  maintenance  costs are expensed as incurred;  significant
improvements, renovations, and replacements are capitalized and depreciated over
their  estimated  useful lives.  Certain costs,  principally  payroll,  directly
related to real estate acquisitions and redevelopment, are capitalized.

Depreciation  is computed on a  straight-line  basis over the  estimated  useful
lives of the related assets which range from 25 to 40 years for  properties,  10
to 35 years for major  improvements,  and 3 to 15 years for fixtures,  equipment
and other assets.

INTEREST  Interest is capitalized on  accumulated  expenditures  relating to the
acquisition and development of certain qualifying properties.  During 1995, 1994
and 1993,  total interest paid was  $39,568,000,  $22,944,000  and  $14,649,000,
respectively,  which  includes  $40,000 that was  capitalized  during  1995.  No
interest was capitalized in 1994 or 1993.

DEFERRED FINANCING COSTS Deferred financing costs are generally amortized over a
period not to exceed the term of the  related  debt.  Amortization  of  deferred
financing  costs  is  classified  as  interest   expense  and  included  in  the
consolidated  statements of operations in the amounts of $1,078,000,  $1,180,000
and $707,000 for 1995, 1994 and 1993, respectively.

                   NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS


INTEREST  RATE SWAP  AGREEMENTS  The  Company  enters  into  interest  rate swap
agreements  to alter the  interest  rate  characteristics  of  outstanding  debt
instruments.  The interest rate swap agreements involve the periodic exchange of
interest  payments over the life of the agreements.  Amounts received or paid on
the  interest  rate swap  agreements  that are used to alter the  interest  rate
characteristics  of  outstanding  debt are  recorded  on an accrual  basis as an
adjustment to the related interest expense of the outstanding  debt. The related
amount  payable to and  receivable  from  counterparties  are  included in other
liabilities.  Changes in the fair  value of the  interest  rate swap  agreements
accounted  for under the accrual  method are not  reflected in the  accompanying
financial statements.

INTEREST RATE RISK  MANAGEMENT  AGREEMENTS The Company enters into interest rate
risk  management  agreements  to  manage  interest  rate  risk  associated  with
anticipated debt  transactions.  The Company follows SFAS No.80  "Accounting for
Futures Contracts" which permits hedge accounting for anticipatory  transactions
meeting certain criteria.  Gains and losses,  if any, on these  transactions are
deferred and  amortized  over the terms of the related debt as an  adjustment to
interest  expense.  Changes in the fair values of interest rate risk  management
agreements are not recognized in the financial statements. In the event that the
anticipated transaction is no longer likely to occur, the Company would mark the
derivative  to market and would  recognize any  adjustment  in the  consolidated
statement  of  operations.  The Company does not enter into  interest  rate risk
management agreements for trading purposes.

INCOME PER COMMON SHARE Primary net income per common share is calculated  using
the weighted  average  number of shares  outstanding  during each year.  Options
outstanding  are not  included  since their  inclusion  would not be  materially
dilutive.

INVESTMENT IN MARKETABLE  EQUITY  SECURITIES In connection with certain property
sales during 1995, the Company received  marketable  preferred stock with a fair
value of $7.7 million on the date of receipt. These securities are classified as
available-for-sale    and   are   included   in   other    assets.    Securities
available-for-sale  are stated at fair  value.  Unrealized  gains and losses are
reported as a separate component of shareholders' equity and are not reported in
the  consolidated  statement of operations  until realized or until a decline in
fair value is deemed to be other-than-temporary.

POSTEMPLOYMENT  BENEFITS  Effective  January 1, 1994,  the  Company  adopted the
provisions of SFAS No. 112, "Employers' Accounting for Postemployment Benefits".
This statement  requires the accrual of the estimated cost of benefits  provided
by an employer to its former or inactive employees after employment,  but before
retirement.  Adoption of SFAS No. 112 increased 1994 general and  administrative
expense by $450,000 or $.01 per share.

RECLASSIFICATIONS  Certain previously reported amounts have been reclassified to
conform with the current financial statement presentation.

STOCK BASED COMPENSATION  In October, 1995, the Financial Accounting Standards
Board issued SFAS No. 123, "Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation" which is
effective for the Company's December 31, 1996 financial statements. SFAS No. 123
allows companies to either account for stock-based compensation under the new
provisions of SFAS No. 123 or under the provisions of APB Opinion No. 25, but
requires  pro forma disclosure in the footnotes and financial statements as if
the measurement provisions of SFAS No. 123 had been adopted. The Company intends
to continue accounting for its stock-based compensation in accordance with the
provisions of APB No. 25. As such, the adoption of SFAS No. 123 will not impact
the financial position or the results of operations of the Company.

                       UNITED DOMINION REALTY TRUST, INC.
                   NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

Real estate held for  disposition  includes  two parcels of land,  six  shopping
centers and six smaller  apartment  communities  which  contributed  income from
property  operations in the aggregate amount of  approximately  $4.1 million for
the year ended December 31, 1995. The sales of real estate held for  disposition
are  expected  to occur  during  the first half of 1996,  however,  there are no
assurances that these sales will be  consummated.

Subsequent to its adoption of SFAS No. 121, the Company  recorded a $1.7 million
impairment  loss  associated with management's  decision to sell a shopping
center at a discount as part of a portfolio transaction.

The following is a reconciliation of the carrying amount of real estate held for
investment:

                   NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

At December 31, 1995, the Company had $70 million of unsecured  revolving credit
facilities with four commercial banks. These credit agreements  currently expire
in June, 1996 and 1997, but are renewable  annually by mutual agreement  between
the  Company  and each bank.  Interest  on  borrowings  outstanding  under these
agreements are at varying rates depending on the level of the Company's debt and
the term of the  borrowing.  Generally,  loans for 30 days or more are priced at
LIBOR plus 5/8% to 1%.  Loans of shorter  duration are priced at spreads of 5/8%
to 11/8% over the  applicable  base rate.  The Company is obligated to pay a fee
equal to 1/4% per annum on the average daily amount of the unused portion of the
commitment  during the  revolving  loan period.  None of these  agreements  have
compensating balance requirements.

At December  31,  1995,  the Company  had  unsecured  lines of credit with three
commercial  banks  totalling  $33.5  million.  At December  1995,  there were no
borrowings  outstanding under these lines. Each line is subject to periodic bank
review and requires the Company to maintain a depository  relationship  with the
respective bank, however, there are no formal compensating balance arrangements.
Borrowings bear interest  generally at negotiated  rates in line with borrowings
under the Company's revolving credit facilities.

6. FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS

FAIR VALUE OF FINANCIAL  INSTRUMENTS The following disclosures of estimated fair
value of financial  instruments  were  determined by the Company using available
market  information  and  appropriate  valuation   methodologies.   Considerable
judgment is necessary to interpret market data and develop estimated fair value.
Accordingly,  the estimates  presented herein are not necessarily  indicative of
the amounts that the Company  could  realize upon  disposition  of the financial
instruments.   The  use  of  different  market   assumptions  and/or  estimation
methodologies  may have a material  effect on the estimated  fair value amounts.
The  carrying  amounts  and  estimated  fair  value of the  Company's  financial
instruments at December 31, 1995, both on and off-balance  sheet, are summarized
as follows:

</TABLE>

The following methods and assumptions were used by the Company in estimating the
fair values set forth above.

MORTGAGE NOTES PAYABLE  Estimated fair value is based on mortgage rates believed
to be  available  to the Company for  issuance  of debt with  similar  terms and
remaining maturities as of December 31, 1995.

NOTES PAYABLE The carrying amounts of the Company's  borrowings under short-term
revolving credit agreements and lines of credit are variable rate and therefore,
approximate  their fair values.  The fair value of the Company's fixed rate term
debt are estimated using  discounted cash flow analysis,  based on the Company's
estimated  incremental borrowing rate at December 31, 1995, for similar types of
borrowing arrangements.

INTEREST  RATE  RISK  MANAGEMENT  AGREEMENTS  Fair  value  is  based  on  market
quotations from investment banks.

Disclosure about the fair value of financial instruments is based upon relevant
information  available to the Company at December 31, 1995.  Although management
is not aware of any factors that would have a material  effect on the fair value
amounts reported herein, such amounts have not been revalued since that date and
current  estimates  of fair  value may  significantly  differ  from the  amounts
presented.

                   NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

INTEREST  RATE SWAP  AGREEMENTS  Interest  rate swap  contracts  with a notional
amount  of   $10,000,000   and   $20,000,000   matured  during  1994  and  1993,
respectively.  At December 31, 1995, there were no interest rate swap agreements
outstanding,  nor were there any  interest  rate swap  agreements  entered  into
during 1995.  For all periods  presented,  the Company had no deferred  gains or
losses relating to terminated  swap contracts.  Interest rate swap contracts did
not have a  material  impact on  interest  expense  or  consolidated  results of
operations during the periods presented.

INTEREST RATE RISK MANAGEMENT AGREEMENTS In 1995, the Company entered into a $50
million (notional amount) fixed pay forward starting swap agreement with a major
Wall Street  investment  banking firm in order to reduce the interest  rate risk
associated with the anticipated refinancing of fixed-rate debt maturing in 1996.
The  transaction  allowed  the  Company to lock-in a ten year  Treasury  rate of
6.544% on or  before  July 15,  1996.  The  Company  anticipates  unwinding  the
interest rate swap transaction upon refinancing of the $50 million debt in 1996.
At December 31, 1995,  the Company had a $2.6  million  unrealized  loss on this
transaction.  In  anticipation of the issuance of  approximately  $50 million of
medium-term  notes during the first quarter of 1996, the Company  entered into a
$50 million  interest rate lock agreement with one of its commercial  banks. The
transaction  allowed  the Company to lock-in a 10 year  Treasury  rate of 5.946%
beginning  on or before March 1, 1996.  At December 31, 1995,  the Company had a
$1.4 million  unrealized loss on this  transaction.  Any gain or loss from these
transactions  will be recognized  at the  transaction  date and  amortized  into
interest  expense over the term of the new debt. While the Company is exposed to
credit  loss  in  the  event  of  nonperformance  by  the  counterparties,  such
nonperformance is not anticipated as the counterparties are highly rated, credit
quality  companies.  By  entering  into  these  interest  rate  risk  management
agreements,  the Company has reduced its interest rate risk  associated with the
near-term  maturities and  additional  issuance of unsecured debt by effectively
locking in an interest  rate.  There is no credit  exposure to the Company under
these agreements at December 31, 1995.

During  1994,  the Company  entered into two  interest  rate hedge  transactions
involving  futures  contracts with a total  principal  amount of $150 million to
hedge against possible interest rate fluctuations during the period prior to the
issuance of the $150  million  Debentures.  These two  transactions  effectively
reduced the interest rate on the  Debentures  from 8.50% to 8.22% for ten years.
These  contracts were  terminated  upon issuance of the  Debentures.  Gains from
these  contracts of $3.5 million were  deferred as an adjustment to the carrying
amount of the  Debentures  and will be amortized  on a straight  line basis as a
reduction of interest expense over a ten year period.

The Company does not obtain collateral or other security to support  off-balance
sheet  financial  instruments  subject to credit  risk,  but monitors the credit
standing of counterparties.

7. INCOME TAXES

The  differences  between  net  income  available  to  common  shareholders  for
financial  reporting  purposes and taxable  income  before  dividend  deductions
relate primarily to temporary differences, principally real estate depreciation,
the accrual on the preferred stock  dividend,  and the deferral for tax purposes
of certain gains on property sales.

All  realized  gains  (losses)  on  sales  of  investments  are  distributed  to
shareholders if and when recognized for income tax purposes.  Since 1980,  gains
aggregating  approximately  $11.6  million  have been  deferred  for  income tax
purposes and are undistributed at December 31, 1995.

For income tax purposes,  distributions paid to shareholders consist of ordinary
income, capital gains, return of capital or a combination thereof. For the three
years ended  December  31,  1995,  distributions  paid per share were taxable as
follows:

8. PROFIT SHARING PLAN

The "United  Dominion Realty Trust,  Inc. Profit Sharing Plan" (the "Plan") is a
defined  contribution  plan covering all full-time  employees who have completed
1,000  hours  of  service  and  are  age  twenty-one  or  older  at the  time of
enrollment.  Under  the  plan,  participants  may  contribute  a  percentage  of
compensation,  but not in  excess of the  maximum  allowed  under the Code.  The
Company may make  matching  contributions  in an amount equal to a percentage of
each participant's  elective deferral contribution  deduction for that Plan year
as determined by the  Compensation  Committee.  For the years ended December 31,
1995, 1994 and 1993, the Company matched 85%, 75% and 65%, respectively,  of the
first $1,000 annually contributed by each eligible participant. Expenses related
to the Plan and included in the Company's consolidated  statements of operations
for the three  years  ended  December  31,  1995,  1994 and 1993 were  $136,000,
$100,000, and $37,000, respectively.

The  Plan  also  allows  the  Company  to  make  discretionary   profit  sharing
contributions  to the Plan as  determined by the  Compensation  Committee of the
Board of Directors.  Contribu-tions,  if any, are allocated to each  participant
based on the relative compensation of the participant to the compensation of all
participants  (maximum  annual  compensation in the  determination  is $50,000).
Aggregate discretionary  contributions of approximately $400,000,  $250,000, and
$150,000  were  made for the  years  ended  December  31,  1995,  1994 and 1993,
respectively.

9. SHARE OPTIONS

Under the Company's 1985 Share Option Plan (the "Plan"),  as amended,  a maximum
of  2,400,000  options  could be granted,  at the  discretion  of the Board,  to
certain officers,  directors and key employees of the Company,  through 1997. On
December 12, 1995, the Board granted 286,667 incentive stock options  (ISO's)and
85,333  non-qualified  options (NQO's) to certain  officers and key employees of
the Company at $14.63 per share. These options vest on December 31, 1996. Of the
options  outstanding  at  December  31,  1995,  705,480  options  were  not then
exercisable under the provisions of the Plan.

The Plan  generally  provides,  among other  things,  that options be granted at
exercise  prices not lower  than the  market  value of the shares on the date of
grant.  Shares  under  options  which  subsequently  expire or are  canceled are
available for subsequent  grant. For options granted prior to December 12, 1995,
the  optionee  has up to five  years  from the date on which the  options  first
become exercisable during which to exercise the options. For the options granted
on December 12, 1995, the optionee has up to ten years from the date the options
were granted  during which to exercise  the options.  Activity in the  Company's
share option plan during the three years ended  December 31, 1995 is  summarized
in the following table.

10. SHAREHOLDERS' EQUITY

PREFERRED  STOCK In April,  1995,  the Company  sold  4,200,000 shares of 9 1/4%
Cumulative  Redeemable  Preferred  Stock in a public  offering  at $25 per share
("preferred stock"). Net proceeds of the offering,  after deducting underwriting
commissions and direct offering costs,  aggregated  approximately $101.5 million
of which  $33.1  million  was used to repay  then  existing  bank debt and $65.7
million  was used to fund  the  acquisition  of a  portfolio  of nine  apartment
communities.  The  remaining  net  proceeds  were used to help  fund  subsequent
apartment acquisitions.

Dividends on the preferred  stock are payable on a quarterly  basis at an annual
dividend rate of $2.3125 per share. The preferred stock has no par value, with a
liquidation  preference of $25 per share and is redeemable on or after April 24,
2000, solely from the proceeds from the sale of additional capital stock (common
or preferred).  The preferred stock has no voting rights, no stated maturity, is
not subject to any sinking fund or mandatory  redemption and is not  convertible
into any other securities of the Company.

COMMON STOCK In  September,  1995,  the Company  completed a public  offering of
4,550,000  shares of its common  stock at $14.25 per share.  Net proceeds of the
offering,  after deducting  underwriting  commissions and direct offering costs,
aggregated  approximately  $61 million  and were used to repay $26.8  million of
bank debt.  The remaining net proceeds were  temporarily  invested in short-term
money  market  investments  and  were  used  primarily  for the  acquisition  of
additional apartment communities.  In February, 1995, the Company sold 1,360,000
shares of its common stock to a group of  institutional  investors at a price of
$131/8  per share.  Net  proceeds  of $17.8  million  were used to curtail  then
existing bank debt.

All share and per share information in the accompanying financial statements has
been adjusted to retroactively reflect a 2 for 1 stock split in 1993.

OFFICERS'  STOCK PURCHASE AND LOAN PLAN At December 31, 1995,  553,000 shares of
common stock were issued under the Officer Stock  Purchase and Loan Plan.  Under
the plan,  certain  officers  have  purchased  common  stock at the then current
market price with  financing  provided by the Company at 7% interest  only.  The
underlying  notes mature  beginning in November,  1998. A total of 47,000 shares
are available for future issuance under this plan.

                             OF LIMITED PARTNERSHIP

                                       OF

                          UNITED DOMINION REALTY, L.P.

                         DATED AS OF DECEMBER 31, 1995

                                    RECITALS

         United  Dominion  Realty,  L.P.  (the  "Partnership")  was  formed as a
limited  partnership  under  the  laws  of the  Commonwealth  of  Virginia  by a
Certificate of Limited Partnership filed with the Clerk of the State Corporation
Commission of Virginia on October 23, 1995.  The  Partnership  is governed by an
Agreement of Limited Partnership dated as of October 23, 1995, and maintained at
the offices of the Partnership  (the "Original  Agreement").  The parties to the
Original  Agreement are United Dominion Realty Trust,  Inc. (the "Company"),  as
the  General  Partner  (in such  capacity,  the  "General  Partner")  and United
Dominion  Residential,  Inc.,  a Virginia  corporation  ("UDR"),  as the Limited
Partner.

         On  December  29,  1995,  the  Company  assigned  its  interest  in the
Partnership  to  UDRT of  North  Carolina,  L.L.C.,  a  North  Carolina  limited
liability company (the "Original Limited  Partner");  and thereafter on December
29, 1995,  UDR assigned  its 1% interest in the  Partnership  to the Company and
thereupon ceased to be a Limited Partner.

         The General Partner and the Original Limited Partner,  being all of the
partners of the Partnership,  desire to (i) admit additional Limited Partners to
the Partnership and (ii) restate the Original Agreement in its entirety.

                                   AGREEMENT

         NOW, THEREFORE,  in consideration of the foregoing, of mutual covenants
between the parties hereto,  and of other good and valuable  consideration,  the
receipt and  sufficiency  of which are hereby  acknowledged,  the parties hereto
agree to amend the Original Agreement to read in its entirety as follows:


                                   ARTICLE I

                                 DEFINED TERMS

         "AGREED  VALUE"  means the fair market  value of a  Partner's  non-cash

non-cash Capital  Contribution shall be equal to the number of Partnership Units
received by such Partner in exchange for a Property or an interest therein or in
connection  with the merger of a  partnership  of which such person is a partner
with and into the  Partnership,  or for any other non-cash asset so contributed,
multiplied by the "Market  Price"  calculated in accordance  with the second and
third sentences of the definition of "Cash Amount." The name and address of each
Partner,  number of  Partnership  Units issued to such  Partner,  and the Agreed

trading days immediately preceding the date of such valuation.  The market price
for each such trading day shall be the closing  sale price,  regular way, on the
NYSE on such day,  or if no such sale takes  place on the NYSE on such day,  the
average of the closing bid and asked  prices,  regular  way, on the NYSE on such
day. In the event the REIT Shares Amount  includes  rights that a holder of REIT
Shares  would be  entitled to  receive,  then the value of such rights  shall be

quotations and other  information as it considers,  in its reasonable  judgment,
appropriate.

outstanding REIT Shares into a smaller number

                                     - 2 -

<PAGE>



of REIT  Shares,  the  Conversion  Factor shall be adjusted by  multiplying  the
Conversion  Factor by a fraction,  the numerator of which shall be the number of
REIT  Shares  issued  and  outstanding  on the  record  date for such  dividend,
distribution,  subdivision or combination  (assuming for such purposes that such
dividend,  distribution,  subdivision  or  combination  has  occurred as of such
time),  and the  denominator  of which shall be the actual number of REIT Shares
(determined  without the above assumption)  issued and outstanding on such date.
Any adjustment to the Conversion Factor shall become effective immediately after
the  effective  date of such event  retroactive  to the record date, if any, for
such event.

         "EVENT OF  BANKRUPTCY"  as to any Person means the filing of a petition

General Partners as managing General Partner and may from time to time designate

                                   ARTICLE IV

                       CAPITAL CONTRIBUTIONS AND ACCOUNTS

         4.01  CAPITAL  CONTRIBUTIONS.  The  General  Partner  and the  Original
Limited Partner have  contributed to the capital of the  Partnership  cash in an
amount  set  forth  opposite  their  names  on  Exhibit  A.  The  Partners  have
contributed  to the capital of the  Partnership  interests in one or more of the
Exchange  Properties or the partnerships  owning such Exchange Properties as set
forth  opposite  their  names on Exhibit A. The  Agreed  Values of such  Limited
Partners' ownership interests in the Exchange Properties that are contributed to
the Partnership are as set forth opposite their names on Exhibit A.

         4.02  ADDITIONAL  CAPITAL  CONTRIBUTIONS  AND  ISSUANCES OF  ADDITIONAL
PARTNERSHIP  INTERESTS.  Except as provided in this  Section  4.02 or in Section
4.03,  the Partners  shall have no right or  obligation  to make any  additional
Capital  Contributions  or  loans to the  Partnership.  The  Partners,  with the

discretion,  may contribute additional capital to the Partnership,  from time to
time, and receive additional  Partnership  Interests in respect thereof,  in the
manner contemplated in this Section 4.02.

                  (a) Issuances of Additional Partnership Interests. The General
Partner is hereby  authorized to cause the  Partnership to issue such additional
Partnership  Interests  in the form of  Partnership  Units  for any  Partnership
purpose at any time or from time to time, to the Partners (including the General
Partner  and  the  Original  Limited  Partner)  or to  other  Persons  for  such
consideration  and on such terms and  conditions as shall be  established by the
General Partner in its sole and absolute discretion, all without the approval of
any Limited Partners. Any additional Partnership Interests issued thereby may be
issued in one or more  classes,  or one or more  series of any of such  classes,
with such  designations,  preferences and relative,  participating,  optional or
other special rights,  powers and duties,  including  rights,  powers and duties
senior to  Limited  Partnership  Interests,  all as shall be  determined  by the
General Partner in its sole and absolute  discretion and without the approval of
any Limited Partner, subject to Virginia law, including, without limitation, (i)
the allocations of items of Partnership income, gain, loss, deduction and credit
to each such class or series of  Partnership  Interests;  (ii) the right of each
such  class  or  series  of  Partnership   Interests  to  share  in  Partnership
distributions;  and (iii) the rights of each such class or series of Partnership
Interests upon dissolution and liquidation of the Partnership.  Without limiting
the  foregoing,  the  General  Partner  is  expressly  authorized  to cause  the
Partnership to issue  Partnership Units for less than fair market value, so long
as the General Partner concludes in good faith that such issuance is in the best
interests of the Company and the Partnership.  Upon each issuance of Partnership
Units  hereunder,  the General  Partner shall amend Exhibit A attached hereto to
reflect such issuance.

                  (b) Certain  Deemed  Contributions  of Proceeds of Issuance of
Company Securities. If (i) the Company issues securities and contributes some or
all the proceeds  raised in connection with such issuance to the Partnership and
(ii) the  proceeds  actually  received  and  contributed  by the  Company to the
Partnership are less than the gross proceeds of such issuance as a result of any
underwriter's  discount or other  expenses paid or incurred in  connection  with
such  issuance,   then  the  Company  shall  be  deemed  to  have  made  Capital
Contributions  to the Partnership in the aggregate  amount of the gross proceeds
of such issuance that are  contributed to the  Partnership  and the  Partnership
shall be deemed simultaneously to have paid such offering expenses in connection
with the  issuance  of  additional  Partnership  Units to the  Company  for such
Capital  Contributions  pursuant  to Section  4.02(a).  In any case in which the
Company  contributes  less  than all of the  proceeds  of such  issuance  to the
Partnership,  it shall be  deemed to have  contributed  the  gross  proceeds  of
issuance of the number of units of the issued security (or the number of dollars
of  principal  in the  case of debt  securities)  equal to the  quotient  of the
division of the amount of proceeds  contributed by the net proceeds per unit (or
per dollar),  and the Partnership shall be deemed to have paid offering expenses
equal to the product of such number of units (or dollars) times the per unit (or
per dollar) offering expenses.

                  (c) Minimum Limited  Partnership  Interest.  In the event that
either a redemption pursuant to Section 8.05 or additional Capital Contributions
by the General  Partner and the  Original  Limited  Partner  would result in the
Limited  Partners (other than the Original Limited  Partner),  in the aggregate,
owning less than the Minimum Limited Partnership  Interest,  the General Partner
and the Limited  Partners (other than the Original  Limited  Partner) shall form
another  partnership and contribute  sufficient  Limited  Partnership  Interests
together with such other Limited  Partners so that the Limited  Partners  (other
than the Original Limited Partner),  in the aggregate,  own at least the Minimum
Limited Partnership Interest.

         4.03  LOANS TO THE PARTNERSHIP.  If the General Partner determines that
it is in the best interests of the

                                     - 8 -

<PAGE>


Company  and  the  Partnership  to  provide  for  additional  Partnership  funds
("Additional  Funds") for any Partnership  purpose,  the General Partner may (i)
cause the Partnership to obtain such funds from outside borrowings or (ii) elect
to have the Company or a  Subsidiary  or  Subsidiaries  of the Company loan such
Additional  Funds to the Partnership.  The loans to the Partnership  shall be in
exchange for such  consideration  and on such terms and  conditions  as shall be
established  by the General  Partner in its sole and  absolute  discretion,  all
without the approval of any Limited  Partners.  Without  limiting the foregoing,
the General  Partner is expressly  authorized to cause the  Partnership to issue
debt  securities for less than fair market value, so long as the General Partner
concludes  in good  faith that such  issuance  is in the best  interests  of the
Company and the Partnership.

         4.04  CAPITAL ACCOUNTS. A separate capital account (a "Capital
Account") shall  be  established  and  maintained  for each  Partner  in
accordance  with Regulations Section 1.704-1(b)(2)(iv). If (i) a new or existing
Partner acquires an  additional  Partnership  Interest  in  exchange  for more
than a de  minimis Capital Contribution,  (ii) the Partnership distributes to a
Partner more than a de minimis amount of  Partnership  property as
consideration  for a Partnership Interest,  or  (iii)  the  Partnership  is
liquidated  within  the  meaning  of Regulation Section  1.704-1(b)(2)(ii)(g),
the General Partner shall revalue the property of the  Partnership  to its fair
market  value (as  determined  by the General Partner, in its sole discretion,
and taking into account Section 7701(g) of the Code) in accordance with
Regulations Section  1.704-1(b)(2)(iv)(f).  When the  Partnership's  property is
revalued  by the  General  Partner,  the Capital Accounts  of the  Partners
shall be  adjusted in  accordance  with  Regulations Sections
1.704-1(b)(2)(iv)(f)  and (g),  which  generally  require such Capital Accounts
to be adjusted  to reflect the manner in which the  unrealized  gain or loss
inherent  in such  property  (that has not been  reflected  in the Capital
Accounts  previously)  would be allocated among the Partners pursuant to Section
5.01 if there were a taxable  disposition  of such  property for its fair market
value (as determined by the General Partner, in its sole discretion,  and taking
into account Section 7701(g) of the Code) on the date of the revaluation.

         4.05  PERCENTAGE  INTERESTS.  If the number of outstanding  Partnership
Units increases or decreases  during a taxable year,  each Partner's  Percentage
Interest shall be adjusted by the General Partner  effective as of the effective
date of each such  increase or decrease to a  percentage  equal to the number of
Partnership  Units  held by such  Partner  divided  by the  aggregate  number of
Partnership  Units outstanding after giving effect to such increase or decrease.
If the  Partners'  Percentage  Interests  are adjusted  pursuant to this Section
4.05, the Profits and Losses for the taxable year in which the adjustment occurs
shall be allocated  between the several  parts of the year (a)  beginning on the
first  day of the year and  ending  on the next  following  Percentage  Interest
Adjustment  Date,  (b)  beginning  on the day  following a  Percentage  Interest
Adjustment Date and ending on the next following  Percentage Interest Adjustment
Date,  and/or  (c)  beginning  on the first day  following  the last  Percentage
Interest Adjustment Date occurring during the year and ending on the last day of
the year, as may be appropriate,  either (i) as if the taxable year had ended on
the last day of each part or (ii) based on the number of days in each part.  The
General Partner,  in its sole discretion,  shall determine which method shall be
used to allocate Profits and Losses for the taxable year in which the adjustment
occurs. The allocation among the Partners of Profits and Losses allocated to any
part of the year shall be based on the Percentage Interests determined as of the
first day of such part.

         4.06  NO INTEREST ON CONTRIBUTIONS.  No Partner shall be entitled to
interest on its Capital Contribution.

         4.07  RETURN OF CAPITAL  CONTRIBUTIONS.  No Partner shall be entitled
to withdraw  any part of its  Capital  Contribution  or its  Capital  Account or
to receive any distribution from the Partnership,  except as specifically
provided in this  Agreement.  Except as  otherwise  provided  herein,  there
shall be no obligation  to return  to any  Partner  or  withdrawn  Partner  any
part of such Partner's  Capital  Contribution  for so long as the  Partnership
continues  in existence.

         4.08  NO THIRD PARTY  BENEFICIARY.  No  creditor  or other  third party
having dealings with the  Partnership  shall have the right to enforce the right
or obligation of any Partner to make Capital Contributions or loans or to pursue
any other right or remedy hereunder or at law or in equity,  it being understood
and agreed that the provisions of this Agreement shall be solely for the benefit
of,  and may be  enforced  solely by, the  parties  hereto and their  respective
successors and assigns. None of the rights or obligations of the Partners herein
set forth to make Capital  Contributions  or loans to the  Partnership  shall be
deemed an asset of the  Partnership  for any  purpose by any  creditor  or other
third party, nor may such rights or obligations be sold, transferred or assigned
by the  Partnership  or pledged or encumbered by the  Partnership  to secure any
debt or  other  obligation  of the  Partnership  or of any of the  Partners.  In
addition, it is the intent of the parties hereto that no

                                     - 9 -

distribution  to any Limited  Partner shall be deemed a return of money or other
property  in  violation  of  the  Act.  However,   if  any  court  of  competent
jurisdiction holds that,  notwithstanding the provisions of this Agreement,  any
Limited  Partner is obligated to return such money or property,  such obligation
shall be the obligation of such Limited Partner and not of the General  Partner.
Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, a deficit Capital Account of a
Partner  shall not be deemed to be a liability  of such  Partner nor an asset or
property of the Partnership.

                       PROFITS AND LOSSES; DISTRIBUTIONS

         5.01  ALLOCATION OF PROFIT AND LOSS.

                  (a)  General.  Profit  and  Loss of the  Partnership  for each
fiscal  year of the  Partnership  shall  be  allocated  among  the  Partners  in
accordance with their respective Percentage Interests.

                  (b) Minimum Gain Chargeback.  Notwithstanding any provision to
the  contrary,  (i)  any  expense  of the  Partnership  that  is a  "nonrecourse
deduction"  within the meaning of  Regulations  Section  1.704-2(b)(1)  shall be
allocated in accordance with the Partners' respective Percentage Interests, (ii)
any expense of the Partnership that is a "partner nonrecourse  deduction" within
the  meaning  of  Regulations  Section   1.704-2(i)(2)  shall  be  allocated  in
accordance  with  Regulations  Section  1.704-2(i)(1),  (iii)  if there is a net
decrease in Partnership  Minimum Gain within the meaning of Regulations  Section
1.704-2(f)(1)  for any Partnership  taxable year, items of gain and income shall
be  allocated  among  the  Partners  in  accordance  with  Regulations   Section
1.704-2(f) and the ordering rules contained in Regulations  Section 1.704- 2(j),
and (iv) if there is a net  decrease in Partner  Nonrecourse  Debt  Minimum Gain
within the meaning of  Regulations  Section  1.704-2(i)(4)  for any  Partnership
taxable year,  items of gain and income shall be allocated among the Partners in
accordance  with  Regulations  Section  1.704-2(i)(4)  and  the  ordering  rules
contained  in  Regulations   Section   1.704-2(j).   A  Partner's  "interest  in
partnership  profits" for purposes of determining  its share of the  nonrecourse
liabilities  of the  Partnership  within  the  meaning  of  Regulations  Section
1.752-3(a)(3) shall be such Partner's Percentage Interest.

                  (c) Qualified Income Offset.  If a Limited Partner receives in
any  taxable  year an  adjustment,  allocation,  or  distribution  described  in
subparagraphs (4), (5), or (6) of Regulations Section  1.704-1(b)(2)(ii)(d) that
causes or increases a negative  balance in such Partner's  Capital  Account that
exceeds the sum of such Partner's shares of Partnership Minimum Gain and Partner
Nonrecourse  Debt Minimum Gain, as  determined  in accordance  with  Regulations
Sections  1.704-2(g) and 1.704-2(i),  such Partner shall be allocated  specially
for such taxable year (and, if necessary,  later taxable  years) items of income
and gain in an amount and manner  sufficient to eliminate such negative  Capital
Account  balance as quickly as  possible  as  provided  in  Regulations  Section
1.704-1(b)(2)(ii)(d). After the occurrence of an allocation of income or gain to
a Limited  Partner  in  accordance  with this  Section  5.01(c),  to the  extent
permitted  by  Regulations  Section  1.704-1(b)  and Section  5.01(d),  items of
expense or loss shall be  allocated  to such  Partner in an amount  necessary to
offset  the  income or gain  previously  allocated  to such  Partner  under this
Section 5.01(c).

                  (d) Capital Account Deficits. Loss shall not be allocated to a
Limited Partner to the extent that such allocation would cause a deficit in such
Partner's  Capital  Account (after  reduction to reflect the items  described in
Regulations Section  1.704-1(b)(2)(ii)(d)(4),  (5) and (6)) to exceed the sum of
such Partner's shares of Partnership  Minimum Gain and Partner  Nonrecourse Debt
Minimum Gain.  Any Loss in excess of that  limitation  shall be allocated to the
General  Partner.  After the  occurrence of an allocation of Loss to the General
Partner in  accordance  with this Section  5.01(d),  to the extent  permitted by
Regulations Section 1.704-1(b),  Profit shall be allocated to such Partner in an
amount  necessary to offset the Loss previously  allocated to such Partner under
this Section 5.01(d).

                  (e)  Allocations  Between  Transferor  and  Transferee.  If  a
Partner transfers any part or all of its Partnership Interest,  the distributive
shares of the  various  items of Profit and Loss  allocable  among the  Partners
during  such  fiscal  year of the  Partnership  shall be  allocated  between the
transferor and the transferee Partner either (i) as if the Partnership's fiscal

                                     - 10 -

<PAGE>


year had ended on the date of the transfer,  or (ii) based on the number of days
of such  fiscal  year that each was a Partner  without  regard to the results of
Partnership  activities in the respective  portions of such fiscal year in which
the transferor and the transferee  were Partners.  The General  Partner,  in its
sole  discretion,  shall  determine  which  method shall be used to allocate the
distributive  shares  of the  various  items  of  Profit  and Loss  between  the
transferor and the transferee Partner.

                  (f) Definition of Profit and Loss. "Profit" and "Loss" and any
items of income,  gain,  expense, or loss referred to in this Agreement shall be
determined in  accordance  with federal  income tax  accounting  principles,  as
modified by Regulations Section  1.704-1(b)(2)(iv),  except that Profit and Loss
shall not include items of income, gain and expense that are specially allocated
pursuant to Section  5.01(b),  5.01(c),  or 5.01(d).  All allocations of income,
Profit,  gain,  Loss, and expense (and all items contained  therein) for federal
income tax  purposes  shall be identical  to all  allocations  of such items set
forth in this Section 5.01,  except as otherwise  required by Section  704(c) of
the Code and Regulations Section  1.704-1(b)(4).  The General Partner shall have
the authority to elect the method to be used by the  Partnership  for allocating
items of income, gain, and expense as required by Section 704(c) of the Code and
such election shall be binding on all Partners.

         5.02  DISTRIBUTION OF CASH.

                  (a) The General  Partner shall  distribute cash on a quarterly
(or, at the election of the General Partner,  more frequent) basis, in an amount
determined by the General  Partner in its sole  discretion,  to the Partners who
are  Partners on the  Partnership  Record Date with  respect to such quarter (or
other  distribution  period)  in  accordance  with their  respective  Percentage
Interests on the Partnership Record Date;  provided,  however,  that if a new or
existing Partner acquires an additional  Partnership  Interest in exchange for a
Capital  Contribution on any date other than a Partnership Record Date, the cash
distribution  attributable  to  such  additional  Partnership  Interest  for the
Partnership  Record Date following the issuance of such  additional  Partnership
Interest  shall be reduced in the  proportion  that the number of days that such
additional  Partnership  Interest is held by such Partner bears to the number of
days  between  such  Partnership  Record  Date  and  the  immediately  preceding
Partnership Record Date.

                  (b) Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, the
General  Partner is  authorized  to take any  action  that it  determines  to be
necessary or appropriate to cause the Partnership to comply with any withholding
requirements established under the Code or any other federal, state or local law
including, without limitation, pursuant to Sections 1441, 1442, 1445 and 1446 of
the Code.  To the extent that the  Partnership  is required to withhold  and pay
over to any  taxing  authority  any  amount  resulting  from the  allocation  or
distribution  of income  to the  Partner  or  assignee  (including  by reason of
Section  1446  of  the  Code),  the  amount  withheld  shall  be  treated  as  a
distribution of cash in the amount of such withholding to such Partner.

                  (c) In no event may a Partner  receive a distribution  of cash
with respect to a Partnership Unit if such Partner is entitled to receive a cash
dividend  as the  holder of record of a REIT Share for which all or part of such
Partnership Unit has been or will be exchanged.

         5.03  REIT DISTRIBUTION  REQUIREMENTS. Notwithstanding  anything to the
contrary in this  Agreement,  the General Partner shall cause the Partnership to
distribute amounts sufficient to enable the Company to pay shareholder dividends
that  will  allow  the  Company  to (i) meet its  distribution  requirement  for
qualification  as a REIT as set forth in Section  857(a)(1) of the Code and (ii)
avoid any federal income or excise tax liability imposed by the Code.

         5.04  NO RIGHT TO DISTRIBUTIONS IN KIND.  No Partner shall be entitled
to demand property other than cash in connection with any distributions by the
Partnership.

         5.05  LIMITATIONS ON RETURN OF CAPITAL  CONTRIBUTIONS.  Notwithstanding
any of the  provisions  of this  Article V, no  Partner  shall have the right to
receive and the General Partner shall not have the right to make, a distribution
that  includes  a return of all or part of a  Partner's  Capital  Contributions,
unless after giving effect to the return of a Capital  Contribution,  the sum of
all  Partnership  liabilities,  other than the  liabilities to a Partner for the
return of his Capital Contribution, does not exceed the fair market value of the
Partnership's assets.

         5.06  DISTRIBUTIONS UPON LIQUIDATION.

                  (a) Upon liquidation of the Partnership,  after payment of, or
adequate provision for, debts and obligations of the Partnership,  including any
Partner loans, any remaining  assets of the Partnership  shall be distributed to
all Partners with positive  Capital Accounts in accordance with their respective
positive Capital Account balances.  For purposes of the preceding sentence,  the
Capital Account of each Partner shall be determined  after all adjustments  made
in accordance with Sections 5.01 and 5.02 resulting from Partnership  operations
and from all  sales  and  dispositions  of all or any part of the  Partnership's
assets. Any distributions pursuant to this Section 5.06 shall be made by the end
of the Partnership's taxable year in which the liquidation occurs (or, if later,
within  90  days  after  the  date of the  liquidation).  To the  extent  deemed
advisable by the General Partner, appropriate arrangements (including the use of
a liquidating  trust) may be made to assure that adequate funds are available to
pay any contingent debts or obligations.

                  (b) If the  General  Partner  has a  negative  balance  in its
Capital Account following a liquidation of the Partnership,  as determined after
taking into account all Capital Account  adjustments in accordance with Sections
5.01 and 5.02  resulting  from  Partnership  operations  and from all  sales and
dispositions of all or any part of the Partnership's assets, the General Partner
shall  contribute  to the  Partnership  an amount of cash equal to the  negative
balance in its Capital Account and such cash shall be paid or distributed by the
Partnership to creditors, if any, and then to the Limited Partners in accordance
with Section 5.06(a).  Such contribution by the General Partner shall be made by
the end of the Partnership's  taxable year in which the liquidation  occurs (or,
if later, within 90 days after the date of the liquidation).

         5.07  SUBSTANTIAL ECONOMIC EFFECT. It is the intent of the Partners
that the allocations of Profit and Loss under the Agreement have substantial
economic effect (or be consistent with the Partners'  interests in the
Partnership in the case of the allocation of losses  attributable  to
nonrecourse  debt) within the meaning  of  Section  704(b)  of the  Code  as
interpreted  by the  Regulations promulgated  pursuant thereto.  Article V and
other relevant  provisions of this Agreement shall be interpreted in a manner
consistent with such intent.

                  REITs,  mortgage loans and  participations  therein,  that the

                  the best  interests  of the  business  of the  Company and the
                  Partnership;

                           (ii)  to construct buildings and make other

                  allowing the General Partner at all times to qualify as a REIT
                  unless the General  Partner  voluntarily  terminates  its REIT
                  status)  and to possess and enjoy all of the rights and powers
                  of a general partner as provided by the Act.

                  (b) Except as  otherwise  provided  herein,  to the extent the
duties of the General Partner require  expenditures of funds to be paid to third
parties, the General Partner shall not have any obligations  hereunder except to
the  extent  that  Partnership  funds  are  reasonably  available  to it for the
performance  of such duties,  and nothing  herein  contained  shall be deemed to
authorize or require the General Partner, in its capacity as such, to expend its
individual  funds for payment to third  parties or to undertake  any  individual
liability or obligation on behalf of the Partnership.

         6.02  DELEGATION OF AUTHORITY.  The General Partner may delegate any or
all of its powers, rights and obligations  hereunder,  and may appoint,  employ,
contract or otherwise  deal with any Person for the  transaction of the business
of the Partnership,  which Person may, under supervision of the General Partner,
perform  any acts or services  for the  Partnership  as the General  Partner may
approve.

         6.03  INDEMNIFICATION AND EXCULPATION OF INDEMNITEES.

                  (a) The  Partnership  shall  indemnify an Indemnitee  from and
against  any and all losses,  claims,  damages,  liabilities,  joint or several,
expenses  (including  reasonable  legal fees and  expenses),  judgments,  fines,
settlements,  and  other  amounts  arising  from  any and all  claims,  demands,
actions, suits or proceedings, civil, criminal, administrative or investigative,
that relate to the operations of the  Partnership as set forth in this Agreement
in which any Indemnitee may be involved,  or is threatened to be involved,  as a
party or otherwise,  unless it is  established  that: (i) the act or omission of
the  Indemnitee  was material to the matter  giving rise to the  proceeding  and
either was  committed  in bad faith or was the  result of active and  deliberate
dishonesty;  (ii) the Indemnitee  actually received an improper personal benefit
in money, property or services; or (iii) in the case of any criminal proceeding,
the  Indemnitee  had  reasonable  cause to believe  that the act or omission was
unlawful.  The  termination of any  proceeding by judgment,  order or settlement
does not create a  presumption  that the  Indemnitee  did not meet the requisite
standard of conduct set forth in this Section  6.03(a).  The  termination of any
proceeding by conviction or upon a plea of nolo contendere or its equivalent, or
an entry of an order of  probation  prior  to  judgment,  creates  a  rebuttable
presumption  that the Indemnitee acted in a manner contrary to that specified in
this Section 6.03(a). Any indemnification pursuant to this Section 6.03 shall be
made only out of the assets of the Partnership.

                  (b) The Partnership may reimburse an Indemnitee for reasonable
expenses  incurred by an Indemnitee who is a party to a proceeding in advance of
the final disposition of the proceeding upon receipt by the Partnership of (i) a
written affirmation by the Indemnitee of the Indemnitee's good faith belief that
the standard of conduct  necessary for  indemnification  by the  Partnership  as
authorized in this Section 6.03 has been met, and (ii) a written  undertaking by
or on behalf of the  Indemnitee  to repay the amount if it shall  ultimately  be
determined that the standard of conduct has not been met.

                  (c) The indemnification provided by this Section 6.03 shall be
in addition to any other rights to which an  Indemnitee  or any other Person may
be entitled  under any  agreement,  pursuant to any vote of the  Partners,  as a
matter of law or  otherwise,  and shall  continue  as to an  Indemnitee  who has
ceased to serve in such capacity.

                  (d) The  Partnership may purchase and maintain  insurance,  on
behalf of the  Indemnitees  and such other Persons as the General  Partner shall
determine,  against any liability that may be asserted  against or expenses that
may be incurred by such Person in connection with the Partnership's  activities,
regardless  of whether the  Partnership  would have the power to indemnify  such
Person against such liability under the provisions of this Agreement.

                  (e) For purposes of this Section 6.03, the  Partnership  shall
be deemed to have  requested an  Indemnitee to serve as fiduciary of an employee
benefit plan  whenever the  performance  by it of its duties to the  Partnership
also  imposes  duties on, or otherwise  involves  services by, it to the plan or
participants  or  beneficiaries  of  the  plan;  excise  taxes  assessed  on  an
Indemnitee  with respect to an employee  benefit plan pursuant to applicable law
shall  constitute  fines  within the meaning of this Section  6.03;  and actions
taken or omitted by an  Indemnitee  with respect to an employee  benefit plan in
the performance of its duties for a purpose  reasonably  believed by it to be in
the interest of the participants  and  beneficiaries of the plan shall be deemed
to be  for a  purpose  which  is  not  opposed  to  the  best  interests  of the
Partnership.

                  (f) In no event may an Indemnitee subject the Limited Partners
to personal liability by reason of the  indemnification  provisions set forth in
this Agreement.

                  (g) An Indemnitee shall not be denied indemnification in whole
or in part under this Section 6.03 because the Indemnitee had an interest in the
transaction with respect to which the indemnification applies if the transaction
was otherwise permitted by the terms of this Agreement.

                  (h) The provisions of this Section 6.03 are for the benefit of
the Indemnitees,  their heirs, successors,  assigns and administrators and shall
not be deemed to create any rights for the benefit of any other Persons.

         6.04  LIABILITY OF THE GENERAL PARTNER.

                  (a) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in this
Agreement,  the General Partner shall not be liable for monetary  damages to the
Partnership or any Partners for losses  sustained or  liabilities  incurred as a
result of errors in judgment  or of any act or  omission if the General  Partner
acted in good faith. The General Partner shall not be in breach of any duty that
the General  Partner may owe to the Limited  Partners or the  Partnership or any
other  Persons  under this  Agreement or of any duty stated or implied by law or
equity provided the General Partner,  acting in good faith,  abides by the terms
of this Agreement.

                  (b)  The  Limited  Partners  expressly  acknowledge  that  the
General  Partner is acting on behalf of the  Partnership,  the  Company  and the
Company's  shareholders  collectively,  that  the  General  Partner  is under no
obligation  to  consider  the  separate   interests  of  the  Limited   Partners
(including,  without limitation, the tax consequences to Limited Partners or the
tax  consequences  of some,  but not all, of the Limited  Partners)  in deciding
whether to cause the  Partnership  to take (or decline to take) any actions.  In
the event of a conflict between the interests of the shareholders of the Company
on one hand and the Limited  Partners on the other,  the General  Partner  shall
endeavor in good faith to resolve the conflict in a manner not adverse to either
the shareholders of the Company or the Limited Partners; provided, however, that
for so long as the Company and its  Subsidiaries  own a controlling  interest in
the  Partnership,  any such  conflict  that  cannot be  resolved in a manner not
adverse to either the  shareholders of the Company or the Limited Partners shall
be resolved in favor

                                     - 15 -

of the  shareholders.  The  General  Partner  shall not be liable  for  monetary
damages for losses sustained,  liabilities  incurred, or benefits not derived by
Limited  Partners in connection with such  decisions,  provided that the General
Partner has acted in good faith.

                  (c) Subject to its  obligations  and duties as General Partner
set forth in Section  6.01,  the General  Partner may exercise any of the powers
granted to it under this Agreement and perform any of the duties imposed upon it
hereunder either directly or by or through its agents. The General Partner shall
not be  responsible  for any  misconduct  or  negligence on the part of any such
agent appointed by it in good faith.

                  (d)  Notwithstanding any other provisions of this Agreement or
the Act, any action of the General  Partner on behalf of the  Partnership or any
decision  of the  General  Partner  to  refrain  from  acting  on  behalf of the
Partnership, undertaken in the good faith belief that such action or omission is
necessary  or  advisable  in order (i) to protect  the ability of the Company to
continue to qualify as a REIT or (ii) to prevent the Company from  incurring any
taxes under Section 857,  Section  4981, or any other  provision of the Code, is
expressly  authorized  under this Agreement and is deemed approved by all of the
Limited Partners.

                  (e) Any amendment, modification or repeal of this Section 6.04
or any  provision  hereof  shall be  prospective  only and  shall not in any way
affect the limitations on the General Partner's liability to the Partnership and
the Limited Partners under this Section 6.04 as in effect  immediately  prior to
such  amendment,  modification or repeal with respect to matters  occurring,  in
whole or in part, prior to such amendment, modification or repeal, regardless of
when claims relating to such matters may arise or be asserted.

         6.05  PARTNERSHIP  EXPENSES.  In  addition  to the  expenses  that  are
directly  attributable to the  Partnership,  the Partnership  shall pay the REIT
Expenses that are allocable to the Partnership. The General Partner, in its sole
discretion,  shall  determine what portion of the REIT Expenses are allocable to
the  Partnership.  If any REIT Expenses  determined by the General Partner to be
allocable  to the  Partnership  are paid by the  General  Partner,  the  General
Partner shall be reimbursed by the Partnership therefor.

         6.06  OUTSIDE ACTIVITIES. The General Partner and any officer,
director, employee, agent, trustee,  Affiliate,  Subsidiary, or shareholder of
the General Partner  shall be  entitled  to and may have  business  interests
and engage in business activities in addition to those relating to the
Partnership,  including business interests and activities substantially similar
or identical to those of the  Partnership.  Neither the Partnership nor any of
the Limited Partners shall have any  rights by  virtue of this  Agreement  in
any such  business  ventures, interest or activities.  None of the Limited
Partners nor any other Person shall have any  rights by virtue of this
Agreement  or the  partnership  relationship established hereby in any such
business ventures,  interests or activities,  and the General Partner shall have
no obligation pursuant to this Agreement to offer any interest in any such
business  ventures,  interests  and  activities to the Partnership or any
Limited  Partner,  even if such opportunity is of a character which, if
presented to the Partnership or any Limited Partner, could be taken by such
Person.

         6.07  EMPLOYMENT OR RETENTION OF AFFILIATES.

                  (a) Any  Affiliate  of the General  Partner may be employed or
retained by the Partnership and may otherwise deal with the Partnership (whether
as a buyer, lessor,  lessee,  manager,  furnisher of goods or services,  broker,
agent,   lender  or  otherwise)  and  may  receive  from  the   Partnership  any
compensation,  price,  or other  payment  therefor  which  the  General  Partner
determines to be fair and reasonable.

                  (b) The Partnership may lend or contribute to its Subsidiaries
or other  Persons in which it has an equity  investment,  and such  Persons  may
borrow funds from the  Partnership,  on terms and conditions  established in the
sole and absolute  discretion of the General  Partner.  The foregoing  authority
shall not create any right or  benefit in favor of any  Subsidiary  or any other
Person.

                  (c) The  Partnership  may transfer  assets to joint  ventures,
other  partnerships,  corporations or other business  entities in which it is or
thereby becomes a participant  upon such terms and subject to such conditions as
the General Partner deems are consistent with this Agreement and applicable law.

         6.08  TITLE TO PARTNERSHIP ASSETS. Title to Partnership assets, whether
real,  personal or mixed and whether tangible or intangible,  shall be deemed to
be owned by the  Partnership  as an  entity,  and no  Partner,  individually  or
collectively,  shall have any ownership  interest in such Partnership  assets or
any portion thereof.  Title to any or all of the Partnership  assets may be held
in the name of the Partnership,  the General Partner or one or more nominees, as
the General Partner may determine, including Affiliates of the General Partner.

                           CHANGES IN GENERAL PARTNER

         7.01  TRANSFER OF A GENERAL PARTNER'S PARTNERSHIP INTEREST.

                  (a) Except as provided in Section 7.01(c), 7.01(d) or 7.03(a),
a  General  Partner  shall  not  transfer  all or  any  portion  of its  General
Partnership Interest or withdraw as General Partner.

                  (b) Except as  provided  in Section  7.01(c) or  7.01(d),  the
General  Partner (or all  General  Partners if at any time there are two or more
General  Partners) and the Original Limited Partner will at all times own in the
aggregate at least a 20% Percentage Interest.

                  (c)  Except as  otherwise  provided  in  Section  7.01(d),  no
General Partner shall engage in any merger with or into another Person, any sale
of  all  or   substantially   all  of  its   assets  or  any   reclassification,
recapitalization  or change of  outstanding  REIT Shares (other than a change in
par value, or from par value to no par value, or as a result of a subdivision or
combination of REIT Shares) (a "Transaction"),  unless (i) the Transaction, if a
merger or asset sale,  also includes a merger of the  Partnership or sale of all
or  substantially  all of the assets of the Partnership as a result of which all
Limited  Partners  will  receive  for each  Partnership  Unit an amount of cash,
securities,  or other property equal to the product of the Conversion Factor and
the  greatest  amount  of  cash,  securities  or  other  property  paid  in  the
Transaction  to a holder of one REIT Share in  consideration  of one REIT Share;
and (ii) if, in connection with the Transaction,  a purchase, tender or exchange
offer ("Offer") shall have been made to and accepted by the holders of more than
50% of the outstanding  REIT Shares,  each holder of Partnership  Units shall be
given the option to exchange its  Partnership  Units for the greatest  amount of
cash, securities,  or other property which a Limited Partner would have received
had it (A) exercised its  Redemption  Right and (B) sold,  tendered or exchanged
pursuant to the Offer the REIT Shares  received upon exercise of the  Redemption
Right immediately prior to the expiration of the Offer.

                  (d)  Notwithstanding Sections 7.01(a), 7.01(b) and 7.01(c),

                  (i) a General  Partner may  transfer all or any portion of its
                  General Partnership Interest to (A) a wholly-owned  Subsidiary
                  of  such  General  Partner  or  (B)  the  owner  of all of the
                  ownership  interests of such General Partner,  and following a
                  transfer  of all  of its  General  Partnership  Interest,  may
                  withdraw as General Partner; and

                  (ii)  a  General  Partner  may  engage  in a  Transaction  not
                  required  by law or by the  rules of any  national  securities
                  exchange on which the REIT  Shares are listed to be  submitted
                  to the vote of the holders of the REIT Shares.

Partnership only if the following terms and conditions are satisfied:


                                     - 17 -

<PAGE>


                  (a) the Person to be admitted as a  substitute  or  additional
General  Partner shall have accepted and agreed to be bound by all the terms and
provisions of this  Agreement by executing a counterpart  thereof and such other
documents or  instruments  as may be required or  appropriate in order to effect
the admission of such Person as a General Partner, and a certificate  evidencing
the  admission  of such  Person as a General  Partner  shall have been filed for
recordation  and all other actions  required by Section 2.05 in connection  with
such admission shall have been performed;

                  (b) if the Person to be admitted as a substitute or additional
General  Partner is a corporation  or a  partnership  it shall have provided the
Partnership  with evidence  satisfactory  to counsel for the Partnership of such
Person's  authority to become a General Partner and to be bound by the terms and
provisions of this Agreement; and

                  (c) counsel for the Partnership shall have rendered an opinion
(relying  on such  opinions  from  other  counsel  and the  state  or any  other
jurisdiction  as may be  necessary)  that  the  admission  of the  person  to be
admitted as a substitute or additional General Partner is in conformity with the
Act,  that none of the actions  taken in  connection  with the admission of such
Person  as a  substitute  or  additional  General  Partner  will  cause  (i) the
Partnership to be classified  other than as a partnership for federal income tax
purposes, or (ii) the loss of any Limited Partner's limited liability.

         7.03  EFFECT OF BANKRUPTCY OF A GENERAL PARTNER.

                  (a) Upon the  occurrence  of an  Event of  Bankruptcy  as to a
General  Partner,  if the Partnership is continued  pursuant to Section 2.04(c),
such General Partner shall promptly transfer and assign its General  Partnership
Interest in the  Partnership to the  substitute  General  Partner  approved by a
majority in interest of the Limited  Partners  (excluding  the Original  Limited
Partner)  in  accordance  with  Section  2.04(c) and  otherwise  admitted to the
Partnership  in accordance  with Section 7.02,  and shall  withdraw (or shall be
deemed to have  withdrawn) as General  Partner.  At the time of assignment,  the
bankrupt  General  Partner  shall be  entitled  to receive  from the  substitute
General  Partner the fair market  value of the General  Partnership  Interest of
such bankrupt General Partner.  Such fair market value shall be determined by an
appraiser mutually agreed upon by the General Partner and a majority in interest
of the Limited Partners  (excluding the Original Limited Partner) within 10 days
following  the  occurrence  of such Event of  Bankruptcy.  In the event that the
parties are unable to agree upon an appraiser,  the bankrupt General Partner and
a majority in interest of the Limited  Partners  (excluding the Original Limited
Partner) each shall select an appraiser.  Each such appraiser  shall complete an
appraisal  of the fair market value of the bankrupt  General  Partner's  General
Partnership  Interest  within  30  days  of the  occurrence  of  such  Event  of
Bankruptcy,  and the fair market value of the bankrupt General Partner's General
Partnership  Interest  shall be the  average  of the two  appraisals;  provided,
however,  that if the higher appraisal  exceeds the lower appraisal by more than
20% of the amount of the lower appraisal,  the two appraisers,  no later than 40
days after the removal of the General  Partner,  shall select a third  appraiser
who shall complete an appraisal of the fair market value of the bankrupt General
Partner's General  Partnership  Interest no later than 60 days after the removal
of the General  Partner.  In such case,  the fair market  value of the  bankrupt
General Partner's General  Partnership  Interest shall be the average of the two
appraisals closest in value.

                  (b) The General  Partnership  Interest  of a bankrupt  General
Partner,  during  the time after  occurrence  of the Event of  Bankruptcy  until
transfer under Section 7.03(a),  shall be converted to that of a special Limited
Partner;  provided,  however,  such bankrupt  General Partner shall not have any
rights to  participate in the  management  and affairs of the  Partnership,  and
shall not be entitled to any portion of the  income,  expense,  profit,  gain or
loss allocations or cash distributions allocable or payable, as the case may be,
to the Limited  Partners.  Instead,  such bankrupt General Partner shall receive
and be entitled only to retain  distributions  or allocations of such items that
it would have been entitled to receive in its capacity as General Partner, until
the transfer is effective pursuant to Section 7.03(a).

                  (c) All  Partners  shall  have  given and  hereby do give such
consents,  shall take such actions and shall execute such  documents as shall be
legally necessary and sufficient to effect all the foregoing  provisions of this
Section.

                                  ARTICLE VIII

                             RIGHTS AND OBLIGATIONS
                            OF THE LIMITED PARTNERS

         8.01  MANAGEMENT OF THE  PARTNERSHIP.  The Limited  Partners  shall not
participate in the management or control of Partnership  business nor shall they
transact any business for the Partnership, nor shall they have the power to sign
for or bind the Partnership,  such powers being vested solely and exclusively in
the General Partner.

         8.02  POWER  OF  ATTORNEY.  Each  Limited  Partner  hereby  irrevocably
appoints the General Partner its true and lawful  attorney-in-fact,  who may act
for each Limited Partner and in its name,  place and stead,  and for its use and
benefit,  to sign,  acknowledge,  swear to,  deliver,  file and  record,  at the
appropriate public offices, any and all documents, certificates, and instruments
as may be deemed  necessary  or  desirable  by the General  Partner to carry out
fully the  provisions of this  Agreement  and the Act in  accordance  with their
terms, which power of attorney is coupled with an interest and shall survive the
death,  dissolution or legal incapacity of the Limited Partner,  or the transfer
by the Limited Partner of any part or all of its Partnership Interest.

         8.03  LIMITATION ON LIABILITY OF LIMITED  PARTNERS.  No Limited Partner
shall be liable for any debts,  liabilities,  contracts  or  obligations  of the
Partnership.  A Limited Partner shall be liable to the Partnership  only to make
payments of its Capital Contribution,  if any, as and when due hereunder.  After
its Capital  Contribution  is fully paid, no Limited  Partner  shall,  except as
otherwise  required  by the  Act,  be  required  to  make  any  further  Capital
Contributions or other payments or lend any funds to the Partnership.

         8.04  OWNERSHIP  BY LIMITED  PARTNER OF  CORPORATE  GENERAL  PARTNER OR
AFFILIATE.  No Limited Partner shall at any time, either directly or indirectly,
own any stock or other  interest  in the  General  Partner  or in any  Affiliate
thereof, if such ownership by itself or in conjunction with other stock or other
interests  owned by other Limited  Partners would, in the opinion of counsel for
the  Partnership,   jeopardize  the  classification  of  the  Partnership  as  a
partnership  for  federal  income tax  purposes.  The General  Partner  shall be
entitled to make such reasonable  inquiry of the Limited Partners as is required
to establish  compliance  by the Limited  Partners  with the  provisions of this
Section.

         8.05  REDEMPTION RIGHT.

                  (a)  Subject  to  Sections  8.05(b),   8.05(c),  8.05(d),  and
8.05(e),  each Limited Partner,  other than the Original Limited Partner,  shall
have the right (the "Redemption  Right") to require the Partnership to redeem on
a Specified  Redemption Date all or a portion of the  Partnership  Units held by
such Limited Partner at a redemption  price equal to and in the form of the Cash
Amount to be paid by the  Partnership.  The Redemption  Right shall be exercised
pursuant to a Notice of Redemption  delivered to the Partnership (with a copy to
the General  Partner) by the Limited  Partner who is exercising  the  Redemption
Right (the "Redeeming Partner");  provided,  however, that the Partnership shall
not be obligated to satisfy such Redemption  Right if the General Partner elects
to purchase the Partnership  Units subject to the Notice of Redemption  pursuant
to Section 8.05(b); and provided,  further,  that no Limited Partner may deliver
more than two Notices of Redemption during each calendar year. A Limited Partner
may not exercise the Redemption Right for less than 1,000  Partnership Units or,
if such Limited  Partner  holds less than 1,000  Partnership  Units,  all of the
Partnership  Units held by such  Partner.  The  Redeeming  Partner shall have no
right,  with  respect to any  Partnership  Units so  redeemed,  to  receive  any
distribution  paid with respect to Partnership Units if the record date for such
distribution is on or after the Specified Redemption Date.

                  (b)  Notwithstanding  the  provisions  of Section  8.05(a),  a
Limited  Partner that  exercises  the  Redemption  Right shall be deemed to have
offered to sell the  Partnership  Units described in the Notice of Redemption to
the General  Partner,  and the  General  Partner  may, in its sole and  absolute
discretion,  elect to purchase  directly and acquire such  Partnership  Units by
paying to the  Redeeming  Partner  either  the Cash  Amount  or the REIT  Shares
Amount, as elected by the General Partner (in its sole and absolute discretion),
on the Specified  Redemption  Date,  whereupon the General Partner shall acquire
the Partnership  Units offered for redemption by the Redeeming Partner and shall
be treated for all purposes of this  Agreement as the owner of such  Partnership
Units. If the General Partner shall elect to exercise its right to purchase

                                     - 19 -

<PAGE>


Partnership  Units  under  this  Section  8.05(b)  with  respect  to a Notice of
Redemption,  it shall so notify the Redeeming  Partner within five Business Days
after the receipt by the General  Partner of such Notice of  Redemption.  Unless
the General  Partner (in its sole and absolute  discretion)  shall  exercise its
right to purchase  Partnership Units from the Redeeming Partner pursuant to this
Section  8.05(b),  the  General  Partner  shall not have any  obligation  to the
Redeeming  Partner or the  Partnership  with respect to the Redeeming  Partner's
exercise  of the  Redemption  Right.  In the event  the  General  Partner  shall
exercise its right to purchase Partnership Units with respect to the exercise of
a Redemption Right in the manner described in the first sentence of this Section
8.05(b),  the  Partnership  shall  have no  obligation  to pay any amount to the
Redeeming  Partner with  respect to such  Redeeming  Partner's  exercise of such
Redemption Right, and each of the Redeeming  Partner,  the Partnership,  and the
General Partner shall treat the transaction  between the General Partner and the
Redeeming  Partner for federal  income tax  purposes as a sale of the  Redeeming
Partner's  Partnership  Units to the General  Partner.  Each  Redeeming  Partner
agrees to execute such documents as the General  Partner may reasonably  require
in connection  with the issuance of REIT Shares upon exercise of the  Redemption
Right.

                  (c)  Notwithstanding  the  provisions  of Section  8.05(a) and
8.05(b),  a Limited  Partner  shall not be entitled to exercise  the  Redemption
Right if the delivery of REIT Shares to such Partner on the Specified Redemption
Date by the General Partner  pursuant to Section 8.05(b)  (regardless of whether
or not the General  Partner  would in fact  exercise  its rights  under  Section
8.05(b)) would (i) cause the Company to own, directly or constructively,  10% or
more of the  ownership  interests  in a tenant  of the  General  Partner's,  the
Partnership's,  or a Subsidiary Partnership's real property,  within the meaning
of Section  856(d)(2)(B)  of the Code, (ii) result in the Company being "closely
held" within the meaning of Section  856(h) of the Code, or (iii) in the opinion
of counsel for the Company,  constitute or result in a violation of Section 5 of
the Securities Act.

                  (d) Any Cash Amount to be paid to a Redeeming Partner pursuant
to this  Section  8.05 shall be paid  within 60 days after the  initial  date of
receipt  by the  General  Partner of the Notice of  Redemption  relating  to the
Partnership Units to be redeemed; provided, however, that such 60-day period may
be extended for up to an additional  180-day  period to the extent  required for
the  Company  to issue  and  sell  securities  the  proceeds  of  which  will be
contributed  to the  Partnership to provide cash for payment of the Cash Amount.
Notwithstanding  the  foregoing,  the  General  Partner  agrees  to use its best
efforts to cause the closing of the  acquisition of redeemed  Partnership  Units
hereunder to occur as quickly as reasonably possible.

                  (e) Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, the
General  Partner  shall  place  appropriate  restrictions  on the ability of the
Limited Partners to exercise their Redemption  Rights as and if deemed necessary
to  ensure  that  the  Partnership   does  not  constitute  a  "publicly  traded
partnership" under section 7704 of the Code.

         8.06  NYSE LISTING AND SECURITIES ACT REGISTRATION OF REIT SHARES.
In the event that the  General  Partner  elects to acquire a  Redeeming
Partner's  Partnership  Units by paying to such Partner the REIT Shares  Amount,
the REIT Shares issued to the  Redeeming  Partner will be (a) listed on the NYSE
and (b) if and to the extent  provided in such  Redeeming  Partner's  Investment
Agreement,  registered  under the  Securities  Act and/or  entitled to rights to
Securities Act registration.

                                   ARTICLE IX

                   TRANSFERS OF LIMITED PARTNERSHIP INTERESTS

         9.01  PURCHASE FOR INVESTMENT.

                  (a) Each Limited Partner hereby represents and warrants to the
General Partner and to the  Partnership  that the acquisition of his Partnership
Interest is made as a principal for his account for investment purposes only and
not with a view to the resale or distribution of such Partnership Interest.

                  (b) Each Limited Partner agrees that he will not sell,  assign
or otherwise transfer his Partnership Interest or any fraction thereof,  whether
voluntarily  or by operation  of law or at judicial  sale or  otherwise,  to any
Person  who does not make the  representations  and  warranties  to the  General
Partner  set forth in Section  9.01(a)  above and  similarly  agree not to sell,
assign or transfer such  Partnership  Interest or fraction thereof to any Person
who does not similarly represent, warrant and agree.

         9.02  RESTRICTIONS ON TRANSFER OF LIMITED PARTNERSHIP INTERESTS.

                  (a) Subject to the  provisions  of Sections  9.02(b),  (c) and
(d), a Limited Partner may offer, sell, assign, hypothecate, pledge or otherwise
transfer all or any portion of his Limited Partnership  Interest, or any of such
Limited Partner's economic rights as a Limited Partner,  whether  voluntarily or
by  operation  of  law  or  at  judicial  sale  or  otherwise  (collectively,  a
"Transfer"),  with or without the consent of the  General  Partner.  The General
Partner may require, as a condition of any Transfer,  that the transferor assume
all costs incurred by the Partnership in connection therewith.

                  (b) No Limited  Partner  may effect a Transfer  of its Limited
Partnership  Interest,  in whole or in part, if, in the opinion of legal counsel
for the  Partnership,  such proposed  Transfer would require the registration of
the Limited  Partnership  Interest under the  Securities Act or would  otherwise
violate any  applicable  federal or state  securities or blue sky law (including
investment suitability standards).

                  (c) No transfer by a Limited Partner of its Partnership Units,
in whole or in part,  may be made to any Person if (i) in the opinion of counsel
for the  Partnership,  the  transfer  would  result in the  Partnership's  being
treated as an association  taxable as a corporation (other than a qualified REIT
subsidiary  within  the  meaning of  Section  856(i) of the  Code),  (ii) in the
opinion of counsel for the Partnership, it would adversely affect the ability of
the  Company to  continue  to qualify  as a REIT or subject  the  Company to any
additional  taxes under  Section 857 or Section 4981 of the Code,  or (iii) such
transfer  is  effectuated  through  an  "established  securities  market"  or  a
"secondary market (or the substantial equivalent thereof)" within the meaning of
Section 7704 of the Code.

                  (d) No  transfer  of any  Partnership  Units  may be made to a
lender to the  Partnership  or any Person who is related  (within the meaning of
Regulations  Section  1.752-4(b))  to any lender to the  Partnership  whose loan
constitutes a nonrecourse  liability (within the meaning of Regulations  Section
1.752-1(a)(2)),  without  the  consent  of the  General  Partner,  which  may be
withheld in its sole and absolute  discretion,  provided  that as a condition to
such consent the lender will be required to enter into an  arrangement  with the
Partnership  and the  General  Partner to exchange or redeem for the Cash Amount
any Partnership Units in which a security interest is held  simultaneously  with
the time at which such lender would be deemed to be a partner in the Partnership
for purposes of allocating  liabilities  to such lender under Section 752 of the
Code.

                  (e) Any Transfer in  contravention of any of the provisions of
this Article IX shall be void and  ineffectual and shall not be binding upon, or
recognized by, the Partnership.

assignee of the Limited  Partnership  Interest of a Limited Partner (which shall

as a Limited Partner of the Partnership only upon the satisfactory completion of
the following:

                             (i) The assignee  shall have accepted and agreed to
                  be bound by the  terms and  provisions  of this  Agreement  by
                  executing a counterpart or an amendment  thereof,  including a
                  revised  Exhibit A, and such other documents or instruments as
                  the  General  Partner  may  require  in  order to  effect  the
                  admission of such Person as a Limited Partner.

                            (ii) To the extent required,  an amended Certificate
                  evidencing  the admission of such Person as a Limited  Partner
                  shall have been signed,  acknowledged  and filed for record in
                  accordance with the Act.

                           (iii) The  assignee  shall  have  delivered  a letter
                  containing the representation set forth in Section 9.01(a) and

                            (iv) If the assignee is a  corporation,  partnership
                  or trust, the assignee shall have provided the General Partner
                  with evidence  satisfactory  to counsel for the Partnership of
                  the assignee's authority to become a Limited Partner under the
                  terms and provisions of this Agreement.

                             (v) The  assignee  shall  have  executed a power of
                  attorney  containing  the  terms and  provisions  set forth in
                  Section 8.02.

                            (vi) The  assignee  shall  have paid all  reasonable
                  legal fees of the  Partnership  and the  General  Partner  and
                  filing  and   publication   costs  in   connection   with  its
                  substitution as a Limited Partner.

                           (vii) The assignee  has  obtained  the prior  written
                  consent  of  the  General   Partner  to  its  admission  as  a
                  Substitute  Limited  Partner,  which  consent  may be given or
                  denied  in the  exercise  of the  General  Partner's  sole and
                  absolute discretion.

                  (b) For the  purpose  of  allocating  Profits  and  Losses and
distributing  cash received by the  Partnership,  a Substitute  Limited  Partner
shall  be  treated  as  having  become,  and  appearing  in the  records  of the
Partnership  as, a Partner  upon the  filing  of the  Certificate  described  in
Section  9.03(a)(ii)  or, if no such filing is  required,  the later of the date
specified in the transfer documents or the date on which the General Partner has
received all necessary instruments of transfer and substitution.

                  (c) The  General  Partner  shall  cooperate  with  the  Person

Partnership  shall take all such  action as promptly  as  practicable  after the
satisfaction  of the  conditions  in this  Article IX to the  admission  of such
Person as a Limited Partner of the Partnership.

         9.04  RIGHTS OF ASSIGNEES OF PARTNERSHIP INTERESTS.

                  (a)  Subject  to the  provisions  of  Sections  9.01 and 9.02,
except as required by operation of law, the  Partnership  shall not be obligated

of its Partnership Interest until the Partnership has received notice thereof.

                  (b) Any Person who is the  assignee of all or any portion of a
Limited Partner's Limited Partnership Interest, but does not become a Substitute
Limited Partner and desires to make a further assignment of such Limited

                                                     - 22 -

Partnership Interest,  shall be subject to all the provisions of this Article IX
to the same  extent and in the same manner as any  Limited  Partner  desiring to
make an assignment of its Limited Partnership Interest.

         9.05  EFFECT OF BANKRUPTCY,  DEATH,  INCOMPETENCE  OR  TERMINATION OF A
LIMITED  PARTNER.  The  occurrence  of an Event of  Bankruptcy  as to a  Limited
Partner,  the death of a Limited Partner or a final  adjudication that a Limited
Partner is  incompetent  (which  term  shall  include,  but not be  limited  to,
insanity) shall not cause the termination or dissolution of the Partnership, and
the  business  of the  Partnership  shall  continue  if an order for relief in a
bankruptcy  proceeding  is entered  against a Limited  Partner,  the  trustee or
receiver of his estate or, if he dies, his executor,  administrator  or trustee,
or,  if he is  finally  adjudicated  incompetent,  his  committee,  guardian  or
conservator,  shall have the rights of such  Limited  Partner for the purpose of
settling  or  managing  his  estate  property  and such  power as the  bankrupt,
deceased or incompetent  Limited Partner  possessed to assign all or any part of
his Partnership Interest and to join with the assignee in satisfying  conditions
precedent to the admission of the assignee as a Substitute Limited Partner.

         9.06  JOINT  OWNERSHIP  OF  INTERESTS.  A  Partnership Interest  may be
acquired  by two  individuals  as joint  tenants  with  right  of  survivorship,
provided that such  individuals  either are married or are related and share the
same home as tenants in common.  The  written  consent or vote of both owners of
any such jointly held  Partnership  Interest shall be required to constitute the
action of the owners of such Partnership Interest;  provided,  however, that the
written  consent of only one joint owner will be required if the Partnership has
been provided with evidence satisfactory to the counsel for the Partnership that
the actions of a single  joint owner can bind both owners  under the  applicable
laws of the state of residence of such joint owners. Upon the death of one owner
of a Partnership  Interest held in a joint tenancy with a right of survivorship,
the Partnership  Interest shall become owned solely by the survivor as a Limited
Partner and not as an assignee.  The Partnership need not recognize the death of
one of the owners of a  jointly-held  Partnership  Interest  until it shall have
received  notice of such death.  Upon notice to the General  Partner from either
owner,  the General Partner shall cause the  Partnership  Interest to be divided
into two equal Partnership Interests, which shall thereafter be owned separately
by each of the former owners.

Partnership  Interest  of any  Partner,  the  Partnership,  at the option of the
General  Partner,  may elect  pursuant  to Section 754 of the Code to adjust the
basis of the Properties. Notwithstanding anything contained in Article V of this
Agreement,  any  adjustments  made pursuant to Section 754 shall affect only the

other Partners for any purpose under this  Agreement.  Each Partner will furnish
