                                     PART I


Item 1.  Description of Business

      (a)  General development of business.

      Walgreen Co. (the "company" or "Walgreens") is America's largest drugstore
retailer and during the fiscal year ended August 31, 1995, had net sales of
$10,395,096,000.  The company served customers in 31 states and Puerto Rico
through 2,083 retail drugstores and 2 mail order facilities.

      In fiscal 1995, the company opened 205 new drugstores and one mail service
facility, completed remodelings of 84 units, and closed 88 drugstores and one
mail service facility.  In the last five fiscal years, the company has opened
763 new drugstores, 2 new mail service facilities, acquired 24 stores, completed
remodelings of 543 units and closed 263 drugstores and one mail service
facility.  In addition, two major distribution centers were added during the
five-year period and one was closed.

      Prescription sales were 43.4% of total sales for fiscal 1995 compared to
40.8% in 1994 and 38.2% in 1993.  Pharmacy sales trends are expected to continue
primarily because of expansion into new markets, increased penetration in
existing markets and demographic changes such as the aging population.

      The company expects to open 200 or more new stores annually for the next
five years, with the goal of operating 3,000 stores by the year 2000.  Plans
during fiscal 1996 include opening 10 to 15 stores each in the new Dallas/Fort
Worth and Las Vegas markets, as well as four to five in Portland, Oregon.  By
the end of fiscal 1996 more than 400 stores are expected to offer one-hour
photofinishing.  Store implementation of Intercom Plus, an advanced pharmacy
computer and workflow system, is expected to be completed in fiscal 1997.
Healthcare Plus, the company's managed care subsidiary, has formed its own PBM
(pharmacy benefits manager) network and will begin serving new plans in January.

      (b)  Financial information about industry segments.

      The company's primary business is the operation of retail drugstores.

      (c)  Narrative description of business.

             (i)  Principal products produced and services rendered.

                  The drugstores are engaged in the retail sale of prescription
             and nonprescription drugs and carry additional product lines such
             as general merchandise, liquor and beverages, cosmetics, toiletries
             and tobacco.

                                          1

                 The estimated contributions of various product classes to sales
            for each of the last three fiscal years are as follows:

                                                             Percentage
                        Product Class                1995       1994       1993

                        Prescription Drugs            43%        41%        38%
                        General Merchandise *         24         24         25
                        Nonprescription Drugs *       13         13         14
                        Liquor, Beverages              8          9         10
                        Cosmetics, Toiletries *        8          9          9
                        Tobacco Products *             4          4          4

                        Total Sales                  100%       100%       100%
                                                    ======     ======     ======
                        * Estimated based, in part, on periodic sampling of
                          about 1% of retail units.

       (ii)  Status of a product or segment.

             Not applicable.

      (iii)  Sources and availability of raw materials.

            Inventories are purchased from numerous domestic and foreign
       suppliers.  The loss of any one supplier or group of suppliers under
       common control would not have a material effect on the business.

            Fuel and other sources of energy are relied upon for the
       distribution of merchandise and in the general operations of the
       retail stores.  Increased energy costs over the years have not
       materially increased the costs of operations.

       (iv)  Patents, trademarks, licenses, franchises and concessions
       held.

             Walgreens markets products under various trademarks and trade
       names and holds assorted business licenses (pharmacy, occupational,
       liquor, etc.) having various lives, which are necessary for the normal
       operation of business.

       (v)  Seasonal variations in business.

            The business is seasonal in nature, with Christmas generating
       a higher proportion of sales and earnings than other periods.  See the
       caption "The Walgreen Year...A Review by Quarters" on Page 30 of the
       Annual Report to Shareholders for the year ended August 31, 1995 ("Annual
       Report"), which is  ncorporated herein by reference.

       (vi)  Working capital practices.

            During fiscal 1995 the company did obtain funds through the
       placement of commercial paper.  The company generally finances its
       inventory and expansion needs with internally generated funds.  However,
       short-term borrowings are anticipated during fiscal 1996 to support
       working capital needs.

                                       2
            Due to the nature of the retail drugstore business, sales are
       principally for cash.  Customer returns are immaterial.

       (vii)  Dependence upon limited number of customers.

            Sales are to numerous customers which include health maintenance
       organizations (HMOs); therefore, the loss of any one customer or a group
       of customers under common control would not have a material effect on the
       business.  No customer accounts for ten percent or more of the company's
       consolidated revenue.

       (viii)  Backlog Orders.

            Not applicable.

       (ix)  Government contracts.

            The company is not a party to any significant government
       contracts.

       (x)  Competitive conditions.

            The drug store industry is highly competitive.  As one of the volume
       leaders in the retail drug industry, Walgreens competes  with various
       retailers, including chain and independent drugstores, mail order
       prescription providers, grocery, variety and discount department stores.
       Competition remained keen during the fiscal year with the company
       competing on the basis of price, convenience and variety.  The company's
       geographic dispersion tends to offset the impact of temporary economic
       and competitive conditions in individual markets.

            Sales by geographic area for fiscal 1995 were as follows:
                                                    Percent
               State                                of Sales
               Florida                                19
               Illinois                               16
               Texas                                   8
               Arizona                                 7
               California                              6
               Wisconsin                               5
               25 other states and Puerto Rico        39
                                                     100
                                                     ===
       (xi)  Research and development activities.

            The company does not engage in any material research activities.

       (xii)  Environmental disclosures.

            Federal, state and local environmental protection requirements
            have no material effect upon capital expenditures, earnings or
            competitive position of the company.

       (xiii)  Number of employees.

            The company employs approximately 68,800 persons, about 22,800
       of whom are part-time employees working less than 30 hours per week.

                                       3

     (d)  Financial information about foreign and domestic operations and
          export sales.

               All the company sales occur within the continental United States
               and Puerto Rico.  There are no export sales.

Item 2.  Properties

     The number and location of the company's drugstores is incorporated by
reference to the table under the caption "Walgreens Nationwide" on page 33 of
the Annual Report.  Most of the company's drugstores are leased.  The leases are
for various terms and periods.  See the caption, "Leases" on page 26 of the
Annual Report, which section is incorporated herein by reference.  The company
owns approximately 5% of the retail stores open at August 31, 1995.  The
decision has been made to purchase, rather than lease, more store locations than
in the past.  The company has an aggressive expansion program of adding new
stores and remodeling and repositioning existing stores.  Net selling space of
drugstores was increased from 19.3 million to 20.7 million square feet at August
31, 1995.  Over the past five years, approximately 60% of company stores have
been opened or remodeled.

     The company's retail drugstore operations are supported by nine warehouses
with a total of approximately 3,385,000 square feet of space, of which 2,430,000
square feet is owned.  The remaining space is leased with an option to buy.  All
warehouses are served by electronic data processing systems for order processing
control, operating efficiencies and rapid merchandise delivery to stores.  All
stores receive merchandise within two days of ordering.  In addition, the
company uses public warehouses to handle distribution needs.  In 1995, the
company opened the ninth warehouse in Woodland, California and added additional
warehouse space in Orlando, Florida.  Distribution capacity is adequate now, but
as the company continues to expand, additional space will be needed to maintain
service levels.  Studies are ongoing to determine where and when distribution
space will be added.

     The company owns one mail service facility with a ground sublease and
leases a second facility.  The combined square footage of the facilities is
approximately 120,000 square feet.  There are four principal office facilities
containing approximately 500,000 square feet of which 400,000 square feet is
owned and the remainder is leased.  The mail order and office facilities are
adequate for current needs.

Item 3.  Legal Proceedings

       The information in response to this item is incorporated herein by
reference to the caption "Contingencies" on page 27 of the Annual Report.

Item 4.  Submission of Matters to a Vote of Security Holders

       No matters were submitted to a vote of security holders during the fourth
quarter of the fiscal year.

SECTION A

The Preferred Shares

     1.   The Preferred Shares may be issued in one or more
series and with such designation for each such series
sufficient to distinguish the shares thereof from the shares
of all other series and classes, as shall be stated and
expressed in the resolution or resolutions providing for the
issue of each such series adopted by the Board of Directors.
The Board of Directors in any such resolution or resolutions
is hereby expressly authorized to divide the Preferred
Shares into series and to fix and determine the relative
rights and preferences of the shares of any series so
established as to:

          (i)  The rate per annum at which the holders of
shares shall be entitled to receive dividends.

          (ii) The price at and the terms and conditions on
which shares may be redeemed.

          (iii)     The amount payable upon shares in event
of involuntary liquidation.

          (iv) The amount payable upon shares in event of
voluntary liquidation.

          (v)  The sinking fund provisions, if any, for the
redemption or purchase of shares.

          (vi) The terms and conditions on which shares may
be converted, if the shares are issued with the privilege of
conversion.

          The Board of Directors may increase the number of
shares designated for any existing series by a resolution
adding to such series authorized and unissued Preferred
Shares not designated for any other series.

     2.   All Preferred Shares of any one series shall be
identical with each other in all respects, except that
shares of any one series issued at different times as
provided in paragraph 3 of this Section A, may differ as to
the dates from which dividends thereon shall be cumulative.

     3.   Before any dividends on the Common Shares or on
any other class or classes of stock of the Corporation,
ranking junior to the Preferred Shares with respect to
payment of dividends, shall be paid or declared or set apart
for payment, the holders of Preferred Shares shall be
entitled to receive when and as declared by the Board of
Directors, cumulative cash dividends, out of any funds
legally available for the declaration of dividends and in
the case of each series at the rate per annum, and no more,
for the particular series fixed in the resolution or
resolutions providing for the issue of such series of
Preferred Shares, adopted by the Board of Directors, payable
quarterly on such dates, in each year, as may be fixed in
such resolution or resolutions.  With respect to each series
of the Preferred Shares, such dividends shall be cumulative
from the respective dates of issue thereof.  No dividends
shall be paid on any series of the Preferred Shares in
respect of any dividend period unless all cumulative
dividends accrued prior to said dividend period with respect
to all Preferred Shares of each other series shall have been
paid or declared and set aside for payment.

     4.   The holders of Preferred Shares shall be entitled
to vote as a class and otherwise as provided by law.

     5.   Preferred Shares which have been redeemed or shall
have been purchased, converted or otherwise acquired by the
Corporation may thereafter be reissued under such terms and
conditions, not inconsistent with the provisions of this
Section A, as the Board of Directors may thereafter
determine.

     6.   In the event of any voluntary or involuntary
liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the Corporation,
and before any distribution of the assets of the Corporation
shall be made to or set apart for the holders of the Common
Shares or of any other class of shares of the Corporation
ranking junior to the Preferred Shares with respect to
payment of dividends or upon dissolution, liquidation or
winding up of the Corporation, the holders of the shares of
each series of the Preferred Shares then outstanding shall
be entitled to receive payment of such amount, as shall be
stated and expressed in the resolution or resolutions
adopted by the Board of Directors providing for the issue of
such series; but such holders upon receipt of such payment
shall be entitled to no further payment.

     7.   In case of any liquidation, dissolution or winding
up of the Corporation, if the amounts payable with respect
to all series of Preferred Shares then outstanding are not
paid in full, the shares of all series of the Preferred
Shares shall share proportionately in accordance with the
respective amounts which would be payable on said shares if
all amounts payable were paid in full.

     8.   A consolidation or merger of the Corporation with
or into one or more corporations shall not be deemed to be a
liquidation, dissolution or winding up within the meaning of
this Section A.

SECTION B

The Common Shares

     1.   Subject to the limitations set forth in Section A
of this Restated Article R-V, the holders of Common Shares
shall be entitled to dividends if, when and as the same
shall be declared by the Board of Directors out of funds of
the Corporation legally available therefor.

     2.   The holders of Common Shares shall be entitled to
vote as provided by law.

SECTION C

The Preferred and Common Shares

     No holder of any shares shall have any preemptive right
to subscribe for or to acquire any additional shares of the
corporation of the same or of any other class, whether now
or hereafter authorized (including any shares held by the
corporation in its treasury) or any options or warrants
giving the right to purchase any such shares, or any bonds,
notes, debentures or other obligations convertible into any
such shares, excepting only such right, if any, as the Board
of Directors, in its discretion from time to time shall
determine and provide.

SECTION D

     Upon the effective date of this amendment and
restatement, each presently issued and outstanding share of
the Common Stock of this Corporation have a par value of
$.3125 per share of Common Stock.

     3.   PROVISIONS APPLICABLE TO CERTAIN BUSINESS
COMBINATIONS

     3.01 The affirmative vote of the holders of not less
than 80 percent of the outstanding shares of Common Stock of
the Corporation shall be required for the approval or
authorization of any "Business Combination" (as hereinafter
defined) of the Corporation with any "Substantial
Shareholder" (as hereinafter defined); provided, however,
that such 80 percent voting requirement shall not be
applicable if:

          (i)  Such Business Combination was approved by at
least two-thirds of the "Continuing Directors" (as
hereinafter defined) of the Board of Directors of the
Corporation; or

          (ii) The Cash or fair market value (as determined
by at least two-thirds of the Continuing Directors) of the
property, securities or other consideration to be received
per share by holders of the Common Stock of the Corporation
in such Business Combination is not less than the "Highest
Per Share Price" (as hereinafter defined) paid by the
Substantial Shareholder in acquiring any of its holdings of
the Corporation's Common Stock.

     3.02 For purposes of this paragraph 3 of Restated
Article R-V:

     (i)  The term "Business Combination" shall include,
without limitation, (a) any merger or consolidation of the
Corporation, or any entity controlled by or under common
control with the Corporation, with or into any Substantial
Shareholder, or any entity controlled by or under common
control with the Substantial Shareholder, (b) any merger or
consolidation of a Substantial Shareholder, or any entity
controlled by or under common control with the Substantial
Shareholder, with or into the Corporation or any entity
controlled by or under common control with the Corporation,
(c) any sale, lease, exchange, mortgage, pledge, transfer or
other disposition, (in one transaction or a series of
transactions) of all or substantially all of the property
and assets of the Corporation, or any entity controlled by
or under common control with the Corporation, to a
Substantial Shareholder, or any entity controlled by or
under common control with the Substantial Shareholder, (d)
any purchase, lease, exchange, mortgage, pledge, transfer or
other acquisition (in one transaction or a series of
transactions) of all or substantially all of the property
and assets of a Substantial Shareholder or any entity
controlled by or under common control with the Substantial
Shareholder, by the Corporation, or any entity controlled by
or under common control with the Corporation, (e) any
recapitalization of the Corporation that would have the
effect of increasing the proportionate voting power of a
Substantial Shareholder, and (f) any agreement, contract or
other arrangement providing for any of the transactions
described in this definition of Business Combination.

     (ii) The Term "Substantial Shareholder" shall mean and
include any individual, corporation, partnership or other
person or entity which, together with its "Affiliates" and
"Associates" (as defined in Rule 12b-2 of the General Rules
and Regulations under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 as
in effect at the date of the adoption of this Article by the
shareholders of the Corporation (collectively, and as so in
effect, the "Exchange Act")), "Beneficially Owns" (as
defined in Rule 13d-3 of the Exchange Act) in the aggregate
10 percent or more of the outstanding Common Stock of the
Corporation, and any Affiliate or Associate of any such
individual, corporation, partnership or other person or
entity.

     (iii)     Without limitation, any share of Common Stock
of the Corporation that any Substantial Shareholder has the
right to acquire at any time (notwithstanding that Rule 13d-
3 deems such shares to be beneficially owned only if such
right may be exercised within 60 days) pursuant to any
agreement, or upon exercise of conversion rights, warrants
or options, or otherwise, shall be deemed to be Beneficially
Owned by the Substantial Shareholder and to be outstanding
for purposes of clause (ii) above.

     (iv) For the purposes of subparagraph 3.01 (ii) of this
paragraph 3 of Article R-V, the term "other consideration to
be received" shall include, without limitation, Common Stock
or other capital stock of the Corporation retained by its
existing stockholders other than Substantial Shareholders or
other parties to such Business Combination in the event of a
Business Combination in which the Corporation is the
surviving corporation.

     (v)  The term "Continuing Director" shall mean a
Director who was a member of the Board of Directors of the
Corporation immediately prior to the time that the
Substantial Shareholder involved in a Business Combination
became a Substantial Shareholder.

     (vi) A Substantial Shareholder shall be deemed to have
acquired a share of the Common Stock of the Corporation at
the time when such Substantial Shareholder became the
Beneficial Owner thereof.  With respect to the shares owned
by Affiliates, Associates or other persons whose ownership
is attributed to a Substantial Shareholder under the
foregoing definition of Substantial Shareholder, if the
price paid by such Substantial Shareholder for such shares
is not determinable by a majority of the Continuing
Directors, the price so paid shall be deemed to be the
higher of (a) the price paid upon the acquisition thereof by
the Affiliate, Associate or other person or (b) the closing
market price per share on the New York Stock Exchange on the
date when the Substantial Shareholder became the Beneficial
Owner thereof.

     (vii)     The term "Highest Per Share Price" as used in
this paragraph 3 shall mean the highest price that can be
determined to have been paid at any time by the Substantial
Shareholder for any share or shares of Common Stock.  In
determining the Highest Per Share Price all purchases by the
Substantial Shareholder shall be taken into account
regardless of whether the shares were purchased before or
after the Substantial Shareholder became a Substantial
Shareholder.  The Highest Per Share Price shall include any
brokerage commissions, transfer taxes and soliciting
dealers' fees paid by the Substantial Shareholder with
respect to the shares of common stock of the Corporation
acquired by the Substantial Shareholder.  In the case of any
Business Combination with a Substantial Shareholder, the
Continuing Directors shall determine the Highest Per Share
Price.

     3.03 The provisions set forth in this paragraph 3 may
not be amended, altered, changed or repealed in any respect
unless such action is approved by the affirmative vote of
the holders of not less than 80 percent of the outstanding
shares of common stock of the Corporation at a meeting of
the shareholders duly called for the consideration of such
amendment, alteration, change or repeal.

                    AMENDED AND RESTATED
        STATEMENT OF RESOLUTIONS ESTABLISHING SERIES


Pursuant to the provisions of "The Business Corporation Act
of 1983," the undersigned corporation hereby submits the
following Statement of Resolutions Establishing Series.

1.   The name of the corporation is Walgreen Co. (the
"Corporation").

2.   The Board of Directors on July 9, 1986 duly adopted the
     following resolution establishing and designating one
     or more series and fixing and determining the relative
     rights and preferences thereof:

     RESOLVED FURTHER, that pursuant to the authority vested
in the Board of Directors of this Corporation in accordance
with the provisions of its Restated Articles of
Incorporation, as amended, a series of Preferred Shares,
$.25 par value per share, of the Corporation (the "Preferred
Shares") be, and it hereby is, created, and that the
designation and amount thereof, and the voting powers,
preferences and relative, participating, optional and other
special rights of the shares of such series, and the
qualifications, limitations or restrictions thereof, are as
follows:

     Section 1.  Designation and Amount.  The shares of such
series shall be designated as "Junior Participating
Preferred, Series A" (the "Series A Preferred") and the
number of shares constituting such series shall be
2,462,120.

     Section 2.  Dividends and Distributions.

          (A)  Subject to the prior and superior rights of
the holders of any series of Preferred Shares ranking prior
and superior to the shares of Series A Preferred with
respect to dividends, the holders of shares of Series A
Preferred, in preference to the holders of Common Shares,
$.3125 par value per share, of the Corporation (the "Common
Shares") and of any other shares ranking junior as to
dividends to the Series A Preferred, shall be entitled to
receive, when, as and if declared by the Board of Directors
out of funds legally available for the purpose, quarterly
dividends payable in cash on the twelfth day of September,
December, March and June in each year (each such date being
referred to herein as a "Quarterly Dividend Payment Date"),
commencing on the first Quarterly Dividend Payment Date
after the first issuance of a share or fraction of a share
of Series A Preferred, in an amount per share (rounded to
the nearest cent) equal to the greater of (a) $0.25 or (b)
subject to the provision for adjustment hereinafter set
forth, 100 times the aggregate per share amount of all cash
dividends, and 100 times the aggregate per share amount
(payable in kind) of all non-cash dividends or other
distributions other than a dividend payable in Common Shares
or a subdivision of the outstanding Common Shares (by
reclassification or otherwise), declared on the Common
Shares since the immediately preceding Quarterly Dividend
Payment Date or, with respect to the first Quarterly
Dividend Payment Date, since the first issuance of any share
or fraction of a share of Series A Preferred.  In the event
the Corporation shall at any time declare or pay any
dividend on Common Shares payable in Common Shares, or
effect a subdivision or combination or consolidation of the
outstanding Common Shares (by reclassification or otherwise
than by payment of a dividend in Common Shares) into a
greater or lesser number of Common Shares, then in each such
case the amount to which holders of shares of Series A
Preferred were entitled immediately prior to such event
under clause (b) of the preceding sentence shall be adjusted
by multiplying such amount by a fraction the numerator of
which is the number of Common Shares outstanding immediately
after such event and the denominator of which is the number
of Common Shares that were outstanding immediately prior to
such event.

          (B)  The Corporation shall declare a dividend or
distribution on the Series A Preferred as provided in
paragraph (A) of this Section immediately after it declares
a dividend or distribution on the Common Shares (other than
a dividend payable in Common Shares); provided that, in the
event no dividend or distribution shall have been declared
on the Common Shares during the period between any Quarterly
Dividend Payment Date and the next subsequent Quarterly
Dividend Payment Date, a dividend of $0.25 per share on the
Series A Preferred shall nevertheless be payable on such
subsequent Quarterly Dividend Payment Date.

          (C)  Dividends shall begin to accrue and be
cumulative on outstanding shares of Series A Preferred from
the Quarterly Dividend Payment Date next preceding the date
of issue of such shares of Series A Preferred, unless the
date of issue of such shares is prior to the record date for
the first Quarterly Dividend Payment Date, in which case
dividends on such shares shall begin to accrue and be
cumulative from the date of issue of such shares, or unless
the date of issue is a Quarterly Dividend Payment Date or is
a date after the record date for the determination of
holders of shares of Series A Preferred entitled to receive
a quarterly dividend and before such Quarterly Dividend
Payment Date, in either of which events such dividends shall
begin to accrue and be cumulative from such Quarterly
Dividend Payment Date.  Accrued but unpaid dividends shall
not bear interest.  Dividends paid on the shares of Series A
Preferred in an amount less than the total amount of such
dividends at the time accrued and payable on such shares
shall be allocated pro rata on a share-by-share basis among
all such shares at the time outstanding.  The Board of
Directors may fix a record date for the determination of
holders of shares of Series A Preferred entitled to receive
payment of a dividend or distribution declared thereon,
which record date shall be not more than 60 days prior to
the date fixed for the payment thereof.

     Section 3.  Voting Rights.  The holders of shares of
Series A Preferred shall have the following voting rights:

          (A)  Each share of Series A Preferred shall
entitle the holder thereof to one vote on all matters
submitted to a vote of the shareholders of the Corporation.

          (B)  Except as otherwise provided herein or by
law, the holders of shares of Series A Preferred and the
holders of Common Shares shall vote together as one class on
all matters submitted to a vote of shareholders of the
Corporation.

          (C)  Except as set forth herein, holders of Series
A Preferred shall have no special voting rights and their
consent shall not be required (except to the extent they are
entitled to vote with holders of Common Shares as set forth
herein) for taking any corporate action.

     Section 4.  Certain Restrictions.

          (A)  Whenever quarterly dividends or other
dividends or distributions payable on the Series A Preferred
as provided in Section 2 are in arrears, thereafter and
until all accrued and unpaid dividends and distributions,
whether or not declared, on shares of Series A Preferred
outstanding shall have been paid in full, the Corporation
shall not:

               (i)  declare or pay dividends on, or make any
other distributions on, any shares ranking junior (either as
to dividends or upon liquidation, dissolution or winding up)
to the Series A Preferred;

               (ii) declare or pay dividends on or make any
other distributions on any shares ranking on a parity
(either as to dividends or upon liquidation, dissolution or
winding up) with the Series A Preferred, except dividends
paid ratably on the Series A Preferred and all such parity
stock on which dividends are payable or in arrears in
proportion to the total amounts to which the holders of all
such shares are then entitled.

               (iii)     redeem or purchase or otherwise
acquire for consideration shares ranking junior (either as
to dividends or upon liquidation, dissolution or winding up)
to the Series A Preferred, provided that the Corporation may
at any time redeem, purchase or otherwise acquire any such
junior shares in exchange for any shares of the Corporation
ranking junior (either as to dividends or upon dissolution,
liquidation or winding up) to the Series A Preferred; or

               (iv) purchase or otherwise acquire for
consideration any shares of Series A Preferred, or any
shares ranking on a parity with the Series A Preferred,
except in accordance with a purchase offer made in writing
or by publication (as determined by the Board of Directors)
to all holders of such shares upon such terms as to the
Board of Directors, after consideration of the respective
annual dividend rates and other relative rights and
preferences of the respective series and classes, shall
determine in good faith will result in fair and equitable
treatment among the respective series or classes.

          (B)  The Corporation shall not permit any
subsidiary of the Corporation to purchase or otherwise
acquire for consideration any shares of the Corporation
unless the Corporation could, under paragraph (A) of this
Section 4, purchase or otherwise acquire such shares at such
time and in such manner.

     Section 5.  Reacquired Shares.  Any shares of Series A
Preferred purchased or otherwise acquired by the Corporation
in any manner whatsoever shall be retired and cancelled
promptly after the acquisition thereof.  All such shares
shall upon their cancellation become authorized but unissued
Preferred Shares and may be reissued as part of a new series
of Preferred Shares to be created by resolution or
resolutions of the Board of Directors, subject to the
conditions and restrictions on issuance set forth herein.

     Section 6.  Liquidation, Dissolution or Winding Up.
Upon any liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the
Corporation, no distribution shall be made (1) to the
holders of shares ranking junior (either as to dividends or
upon liquidation, dissolution or winding up) to the Series A
Preferred unless, prior thereto, the holders of shares of
Series A Preferred shall have received $100 per share, plus
an amount equal to accrued and unpaid dividends and
distributions thereon, whether or not declared, to the date
of such payment, provided that the holders of shares of
Series A Preferred shall be entitled to receive an aggregate
amount per share, subject to the provision for adjustment
hereinafter set forth, equal to 100 times the aggregate
amount to be distributed per share to holders of Common
Shares, or (2) to the holders of shares ranking on a parity
(either as to dividends or upon liquidation, dissolution or
winding up) with the Series A Preferred, except
distributions made ratably on the Series A Preferred and all
other such parity stock in proportion to the total amounts
to which the holders of all such shares are entitled upon
such liquidation, dissolution or winding up.  In the event
the Corporation shall at any time declare or pay any
dividend on Common Shares payable in Common Shares, or
effect a subdivision or combination or consolidation of the
outstanding Common Shares (by reclassification or otherwise
than by payment of a dividend in Common Shares) into a
greater or lesser number of Common Shares, then in each such
case the aggregate amount to which holders of shares of
Series A Preferred were entitled immediately prior to such
event under the proviso in clause (1) of the preceding
sentence shall be adjusted by multiplying such amount by a
fraction the numerator of which is the number of Common
Shares outstanding immediately after such event and the
denominator of which is the number of Common Shares that
were outstanding immediately prior to such event.

     Section 7.  Consolidation, Merger, etc.  In case the
Corporation shall enter into any consolidation, merger,
combination or other transaction in which the Common Shares
are exchanged for or changed into other shares or
securities, cash and/or any other property, then in any such
case the shares of Series A Preferred then outstanding shall
at the same time be similarly exchanged or changed in an
amount per share (subject to the provision for adjustment
hereinafter set forth) equal to 100 times the aggregate
amount of shares, securities, cash and/or any other property
(payable in kind), as the case may be, into which or for
which each Common Share is changed or exchanged.  In the
event the Corporation shall at any time declare or pay any
dividend on Common Shares payable in Common Shares, or
effect a subdivision or combination or consolidation of the
outstanding Common Shares (by reclassification or otherwise)
into a greater or lesser number of Common Shares, then in
each such case the amount set forth in the preceding
sentence with respect to the exchange or change of shares of
Series A Preferred shall be adjusted by multiplying such
amount by a fraction the numerator of which is the number of
Common Shares outstanding immediately after such event and
the denominator of which is the number of Common Shares that
were outstanding immediately prior to such event.

     Section 8.  No Redemption.  The shares of Series A
Preferred shall not be redeemable.

     Section 9.  Rank.  The Series A Preferred shall rank
junior to all other series of the Preferred Shares, as to
the payment of dividends and the distribution of assets,
unless the terms of such other series specifies to the
contrary.

     Section 10.  Amendment.  The Restated Certificate of
Incorporation, as amended, of the Corporation shall not be
amended in any manner which would materially alter or change
the powers, preferences or special rights of the Series A
Preferred so as to affect them adversely without the
affirmative vote of the holders of two-thirds of the
outstanding shares of Series A Preferred, voting together as
a single class.

                      MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS
                OF RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION


RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

    Fiscal 1995 was the twenty-first consecutive year of record sales and
earnings.  Net earnings were $321 million or $1.30 per share, an increase of
13.8% from last year's earnings of $282 million or $1.14 per share.  Earnings
increases resulted from higher sales and improved expense ratios.

    Sales rose 12.6% to $10.4 billion in fiscal 1995 compared to increases of
11.3% in 1994 and 11.0% in 1993.  Drugstore sales increases resulted from sales
gains in existing stores and added sales from new stores, each of which include
an indeterminate amount of market-driven price changes.  Sales in comparable
stores (those open at least one year) were up 7.2% in 1995, 5.5% in 1994 and
6.3% in 1993.  New stores accounted for 7.6% of the sales gains in 1995, 7.4% in
1994 and 6.2% in 1993.  The company operated 2,085 drugstores as of August 31,
1995, compared to 1,968 a year earlier.

    In spite of continuing low rates of inflation on pharmaceuticals the last
three years, pharmacy sales increased 19.8% in 1995, 18.9% in 1994 and 15.7% in
1993, with comparable stores up 13.8%, 12.1%, and 11.3% in 1995, 1994 and 1993,
respectively.  Prescription sales were 43.4% of total sales for fiscal 1995
compared to 40.8% in 1994 and 38.2% in 1993.  Pharmacy sales trends are expected
to continue primarily because of expansion into new markets, increased
penetration in existing markets and demographic changes such as the aging
population.

    Gross margins as a percent of sales decreased to 28.0% of sales from 28.4%
last year and 28.2% in fiscal 1993.  Prescription margins continue to decrease
as third party sales become a larger portion of pharmacy sales.  However, the
rate of decrease is slowing as a result of emphasizing minimum profitability
standards to third party payers.

    The company uses the last-in, first-out (LIFO) method of inventory
valuation.  The effective LIFO inflation rates were 1.29% in 1995, .3% in 1994
and 2.1% in 1993, which resulted in charges to cost of sales of $21.4 million in
1995, $5.1 million in 1994 and $28.1 million in 1993.  Inflation on prescription
inventory was 2.8% in both fiscal 1995 and 1994, and 4.4% in 1993.  Excluding
prescriptions, the remaining inventory experienced slight deflation during
fiscal 1995 and 1994.

    Selling, occupancy and administration expenses were 23.0% of sales in fiscal
1995, 23.4% of sales in fiscal 1994 and 23.3% of sales in fiscal 1993.  The
fiscal 1995 decrease, as a percent to sales, was caused by store salaries,
insurance costs and advertising.  The fiscal 1994 increase was caused by higher
store salaries, insurance costs and costs associated with closing retail
locations.

    Interest income decreases in both 1995 and 1994 resulted principally from
lower investment levels.  Average net investment levels were approximately $59
million in 1995, $105 million in 1994, and $138 million in 1993.  The lower
investment level in fiscal 1995 was substantially offset by higher interest
rates.  In fiscal 1993 the company retired $100 million 9 1/2% sinking fund
debentures at a cost of $6.8 million ($.02 per share).  This reduced interest
expense by $6.7 million in 1993 and $9.5 million per year thereafter.

    The fiscal 1995 effective tax rate was 38.75% compared to 38.5% in 1994 and
38.6% in 1993.  The increase in rate in fiscal 1995 compared to 1994 was due to
higher state income taxes and estimated interest on tax audits.

FINANCIAL CONDITION

    Cash and cash equivalents and marketable securities were $22 million at
August 31, 1995, compared to $108 million at August 31, 1994.  Short-term
investment objectives are to maximize yields while minimizing risk and
maintaining liquidity.  To attain these objectives, investment limits are placed
on the amount, type  and issuer of securities.

    Net cash provided by operating activities decreased $11 million compared to
the same period a year ago.  This decrease resulted primarily from increased
inventories to support store growth, offset by higher earnings.  The company's
ongoing profitability is expected to continue supporting expansion and
remodeling programs, dividends to shareholders and the funding for various
technological improvements.

    Net cash used for investing activities was $299 million for fiscal 1995
versus $284 million last year.  Additions to property and equipment were $310
million compared to $290 million last year.  Additions for this fiscal year
included expenditures for the new Woodland, California, distribution center.
During the year, a record 206 new or relocated drugstores were opened.  This
compares to 196 new or relocated drugstores opened in the same period last year.
New stores are purchased or leased.  Openings for this fiscal year included 17
purchased locations versus 31 for the same period last year.  Planned capital
expenditures for fiscal 1996 are expected to exceed $300 million.

    The company expects to open 215 new stores in fiscal 1996 and continue to
open 200 or more stores annually for the next five years.  Plans during fiscal
1996 include opening 10 to 15 stores each in the new Dallas/Fort Worth and Las
Vegas markets, as well as four to five in Portland, Oregon.  With the movement
to freestanding store locations (from strip centers and malls), the decision has
been made to purchase, rather than lease, more store locations than in the past.
This will eventually result in lower store occupancy costs and provide the
foundation to capitalize on the strength of the real estate selection process.
Borrowings may be necessary to finance these future obligations.  By the end of
fiscal 1996 more than 400 stores are expected to offer one-hour photofinishing.
Store implementation of Intercom Plus, an advanced pharmacy computer and
workflow system, is expected to be completed in fiscal 1997.  Healthcare Plus,
the company's managed care subsidiary, has formed its own PBM (pharmacy benefits
manager) network and will begin serving new plans in January.

    Net cash used for financing activities was $102 million for fiscal 1995
compared to $86 million in fiscal 1994.  At August 31, 1995, the company had
$123 million in unused bank lines of credit and $100 million of unissued
authorized debt securities, previously filed with the Securities and Exchange
Commission.  In addition, the company has the ability to borrow an additional
$93 million against corporate-owned life insurance policies.

    Earlier this fiscal year, the company received an unfavorable Tax Court
ruling concerning the depreciable lives of certain assets.  The company
appealed, and on October 17, 1995, the United States Court of Appeals rendered
an opinion which reversed the ruling.  The case, which involves approximately
$50 million of tax deductions taken in prior years, was remanded back to the Tax
Court for further findings on the facts.  As of August 31, 1995, the company has
adequately provided for all the tax and related interest.

    Adoption of Financial Accounting Board Statement No. 121 "Accounting for the
Impairment of Long-Lived Assets" is required by fiscal 1997.  This pronouncement
requires long-lived assets to be reviewed for impairment whenever events or
changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the assets may not
be recoverable.  When adopted, it is not expected to significantly impact the
company's consolidated financial position or results of operations.

      The accompanying Statement of Major Accounting Policies and the Notes to
     Consolidated Financial Statements are integral parts of these statements.



                        STATEMENT OF MAJOR ACCOUNTING POLICIES

PRINCIPLES OF CONSOLIDATION

The consolidated statements include the accounts of the company and its
subsidiaries.  All significant intercompany transactions have been eliminated.
Certain amounts in the 1994 and 1993 Consolidated Financial Statements have been
reclassified to be consistent with the 1995 presentation.

ACCOUNTING CHANGES

In fiscal 1993 the company adopted two Statements of Financial Accounting
Standards, SFAS No. 106, "Employers' Accounting for Postretirement Benefits
Other Than Pensions" and SFAS No. 109, "Accounting for Income Taxes."

CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS

Cash and cash equivalents include cash on hand and all highly liquid investments
with an original maturity of three months or less.  All other temporary
investments are classified as marketable securities.

     The company's cash management policy provides for the bank disbursement
accounts to be reimbursed on a daily basis.  Checks issued but not presented to
the banks for payment of $130,000,000 and $88,000,000 at August 31, 1995 and
1994, respectively, are included in cash and cash equivalents as reductions of
other cash balances.

FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS

The company had approximately $18,000,000 and $20,000,000 of outstanding letters
of credit at August 31, 1995 and 1994, respectively, which guaranteed foreign
trade purchases.  Additional outstanding letters of credit of $57,000,000 at
August 31, 1995 and $49,000,000 at August 31, 1994 were related to insurance
activities.  The company also has purchase commitments of approximately
$17,000,000 related to the purchase of store locations.  There were no
investments in derivative financial instruments during fiscal 1995 and 1994.

INVENTORIES

Inventories are valued on a lower of last-in, first-out (LIFO) cost or market
basis.  At August 31, 1995 and 1994, inventories would have been greater by
$415,015,000 and $393,568,000, respectively, if they had been valued on a lower
of first-in, first-out (FIFO) cost or market basis.  Cost of sales is primarily
computed on an estimated basis and adjusted based on periodic inventories.


PROPERTY AND EQUIPMENT

Depreciation is provided on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful
lives of owned assets.  Leasehold improvements and leased properties under
capital leases are amortized over the estimated physical life of the property or
over the term of the lease, whichever is shorter.  Major repairs which extend
the useful life of an asset are capitalized in the property and equipment
accounts.  Routine maintenance and repairs are charged against earnings.  The
composite method of depreciation is used for equipment; therefore, gains and
losses on retirement or other disposition of such assets are included in
earnings only when an operating location is closed or completely remodeled.
Fully depreciated property and equipment are removed from the cost and related
accumulated depreciation and amortization accounts.

Property and equipment consists of (In Thousands):_____________________________

===============================================================================

The company capitalizes significant systems development costs.  These costs are
amortized over a five-year period as phases of these systems are implemented.
Unamortized costs as of August 31, 1995 and 1994, were $84,910,000 and
$66,303,000, respectively.  Amortization of these costs were $11,053,000,
$8,901,000 and $5,712,000 in 1995, 1994 and 1993, respectively.

INCOME TAXES

The company provides for federal and state income taxes on items included in the
Consolidated Statements of Earnings regardless of the period when such taxes are
payable.  Deferred taxes are recognized for temporary differences between
financial and income tax reporting based on enacted tax laws and rates.

RETIREMENT BENEFITS

The principal retirement plan for employees is the Walgreen Profit-Sharing
Retirement Trust, to which both the company and the employees contribute.  The
company's  contribution, which is determined annually at the discretion of the
Board of Directors, has historically related to pretax income.  The
profit-sharing provision was $44,315,000 in 1995, $37,683,000 in 1994 and
$35,119,000 in 1993.

     The company provides certain health and life insurance benefits for retired
employees who meet eligibility requirements, including age and years of service.
The costs of these benefits are accrued over the period earned.  The company's
postretirement benefit plans currently are not funded.

     The company has deferred compensation plans which permit directors and
certain management employees the right to defer a portion of their compensation.
The participants earn interest on deferred amounts depending on various factors
defined in the plans.  Although not linked to the plans, the company has
purchased life insurance on the participants and other key employees to fund the
distributions under these and other benefit plans.

NET EARNINGS PER COMMON SHARE

Primary net earnings per share were computed using weighted average number of
shares and common share equivalents outstanding of 247,527,030 in 1995,
247,292,458 in 1994 and 247,539,548 in 1993.  Fully diluted net earnings per
share are the same as primary net earnings per share.

PRE-OPENING EXPENSES

Non-capital expenditures incurred prior to the opening of a new or remodeled
store are charged against earnings when they are incurred.

ADVERTISING COSTS

Advertising costs are expensed as incurred, and were $85,907,000 in 1995,
$93,467,000 in 1994 and $88,102,000 in 1993.

                   NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

INTEREST EXPENSE

The company capitalized $751,000, $482,000 and $394,000 of interest expense as
part of significant construction projects during fiscal 1995, 1994 and 1993,
respectively.  Interest paid, net of amounts capitalized, was $2,950,000 in
1995, $1,954,000 in 1994 and $9,950,000 in 1993.  In fiscal 1993 the company
retired $100 million 9 1/2% sinking fund debentures, due 2016.

LEASES

The company generally operates in leased premises.  Original non-cancelable
lease terms typically are 20 years and may contain escalation clauses, along
with  options that permit renewals for additional periods.  The total amount of
the minimum rent is expensed on a straight-line basis over the term of the
lease.  In addition to minimum fixed rentals, most leases provide for contingent
rentals based upon sales.

     Minimum rental commitments at August 31, 1995, under all leases having an
initial or remaining non-cancelable term of more than one year are shown below

Total minimum lease payments                                       $4,018,355

The above minimum lease payments include minimum rental commitments related to
capital leases amounting to $15,799,000 at August 31, 1995.  The present value
of net minimum capital lease payments, due after 1996, are reflected in the
accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets as part of other non-current
liabilities.  Total minimum lease payments have not been reduced by minimum
sublease rentals of approximately $13,020,000 on leases due in the future under
non-cancelable subleases.

Rental expense was as follows (In Thousands):

Income taxes paid were $209,258,000, $170,146,000 and $166,848,000 during the
fiscal years ended August 31, 1995, 1994 and 1993, respectively.  The difference
between the statutory income tax rate and the effective tax rate is principally
due to state income tax provisions.

SHORT-TERM BORROWINGS

At August 31, 1995, the company had approximately $123,000,000 of available bank
lines of credit.  The credit lines are renewable annually at various dates and
provide for loans of varying maturities at the prime rate.  There are no
compensating balance arrangements.

     The company obtained funds through the placement of commercial paper, as
follows (Dollars in Thousands):
                                                 1995         1994         1993

================================================================================

CONTINGENCIES

The company is involved in various legal proceedings incidental to the normal
course of business.  This includes a patent infringement suit against the
company and its co-defendant supplier.  On October 20, 1994, a judgment of $11.3
million plus interest was entered on this suit.  The plaintiff subsequently
filed a motion for treble damages, which was denied.  That denial has been
appealed.  The case has also been appealed by the defendants, and the company
has an indemnification agreement from its supplier for the amount of the
judgment plus interest.  Management is of the opinion, with which its General
Counsel concurs, that the patent infringement suit and other legal proceedings
will not have a material adverse effect on the company's consolidated financial
position or results of operations.


CAPITAL STOCK

All share data have been adjusted to reflect a two-for-one stock split
distributed to shareholders August 8, 1995.  In addition the Board of Directors
approved increases in the authorized common stock, from 400 million shares to
800 million shares, and in the authorized preferred stock, from 4 million shares
to 8 million shares.

     The company's common stock is subject to a Rights Agreement under which
each share has attached to it a Right to purchase one-four hundredth of a share
of a new series of Preferred Stock, at a price of $30.00 per Right, in the event
a person or group acquires or attempts to acquire 20% of the then outstanding
shares of the company.  In the event that a person or group acquires 20% or more
of the outstanding common stock of the company (other than in certain instances
as defined in the Rights Agreement), each Right, except those of an Acquiring
Person, would entitle the holder to purchase a number of shares of the company's
common stock which number is determined pursuant to a formula contained in the
Rights Agreement.  The Rights, which are non-voting, will expire on August 21,
1996, but may be redeemed by the company at a price of $.0125 per Right at any
time prior to a public announcement that 20% or more of the company's common
stock has been acquired.

     As of August 31, 1995, 27,168,328 shares of common stock were reserved for
future stock issuances under the company's employee stock purchase, option and
award plans.  Preferred stock of 2,462,120 shares have been reserved for
issuance upon the exercise of Preferred Share Purchase Rights.

STOCK OPTION PLANS

The Walgreen Co. Executive Stock Option Plan provides for the granting to key
employees of options to purchase company common stock over a 10-year period, at
a price not less than the fair market value on the date of grant.  Options may
be issued under the Plan until October 13, 2002, for an aggregate of 9,600,000
shares of common stock of the company.  The number of shares available for
future grant was 1,913,090 and 3,952,750 at August 31, 1995 and 1994,
respectively.  Options granted prior to July 13, 1988, must be exercised in
sequential order.  After this date, options may be exercised in any order
provided they are not restricted by any holding period.

     The Walgreen Co. Stock Purchase/Option Plan (Share Walgreens) provides for
the granting of options to eligible employees upon the purchase of company
shares subject to certain restrictions.  Under the terms of the plan, the option
price cannot be less than 85% of the fair market value at the date of the grant.
Compensation expense related to the plan was $314,000 and $986,000 in 1995 and
1994, respectively.  Options may be issued under this plan until September 30,
2002, for an aggregate of 10,000,000 shares of common stock of the company.  The
number of shares available for future grant was 7,723,712 and 7,756,126 at
August 31, 1995 and 1994, respectively.  The options granted during 1995 and
1994 have a two-year holding period.

     Stock option transactions in fiscal 1993, 1994 and 1995 are summarized as

                                                        1995     1994     1993
     Service costs - benefits earned during the year  $3,781   $2,859   $2,413

       benefit obligation                              5,576    4,638    4,048

     Total postretirement benefit cost                $9,586   $7,768   $6,461
                                                      ======   ======   ======

The company's unfunded accumulated postretirement benefit liability at August
31, included in the Consolidated Balance Sheets were as follows (In Thousands):

                                                                 1995     1994
          Retirees                                            $20,210  $18,228
          Fully eligible active plan participants               9,834   11,244
          Other active plan participants                       45,747   41,390
          Accumulated postretirement benefit obligation        75,791   70,862
          Unrecognized actuarial amount                        (1,820)  (4,469)

                                                              =======  =======

The accumulated postretirement benefit obligation was determined assuming the
discount rate was 7.75% and the healthcare cost trend rate was 7.0% for 1995;
with a gradual decline over a 14-year period to 4.5%.  These trend rates reflect
the company's prior experience and management's expectation that future rates
will decline.  The effect of a 1% increase each year in the projected healthcare
cost trend rate would increase the accumulated postretirement benefit obligation
at August 31, 1995 by $13,731,000 and the service and interest cost components
of the fiscal 1995 net periodic postretirement benefit cost by $1,991,000.  The
unrecognized actuarial amount is being amortized over the average remaining
service period of active plan participants.

              REPORT OF INDEPENDENT PUBLIC ACCOUNTANTS


To the Board of Directors and Shareholders of Walgreen Co.:

We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Walgreen
Co. (an Illinois corporation) and Subsidiaries as of August 31, 1995 and
1994, and the related consolidated statements of earnings, retained
earnings and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended
August 31, 1995.  These financial statements are the responsibility of the
company's management.  Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these
financial statements based on our audits.

        We conducted our audits in accordance with generally accepted
auditing standards.  Those standards require that we plan and perform the
audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements
are free of material misstatement.  An audit includes examining, on a test
basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial
statements.  An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles
used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating
the overall financial statement presentation.  We believe that our audits
provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.

        In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present
fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of Walgreen Co.
and Subsidiaries as of August 31, 1995 and 1994, and the results of their
operations and their cash flows for each of the three years in the period
ended August 31, 1995 in conformity with generally accepted accounting
principles.

        As indicated in the Statement of Major Accounting Policies, under
"Accounting Changes", effective September 1, 1992, the company changed its
 method of accounting for postretirement benefits other than pensions and
 income taxes.



Arthur Andersen LLP

Chicago, Illinois,
  September 29, 1995



                              MANAGEMENT'S REPORT

The primary responsibility for the integrity and objectivity of the consolidated
financial statements and related financial data rests with the management of
Walgreen Co.  The financial statements were prepared in conformity with
generally accepted accounting principles appropriate in the circumstances and
included amounts that were based on management's most prudent judgments and
estimates relating to matters not concluded by fiscal year-end.  Management
believes that all material uncertainties have been either appropriately
accounted for or disclosed.  All other financial information included in this
annual report is consistent with the financial statements.

        The firm of Arthur Andersen LLP, independent public accountants, was
engaged to render a professional opinion on Walgreen Co.'s consolidated
financial statements.  Their report contains an opinion based on their audit,
which was made in accordance with generally accepted auditing standards and
procedures, which they believed were sufficient to provide reasonable assurance
that the consolidated financial statements, considered in their entirety, are
not misleading and do not contain material errors.

        Three outside members of the Board of Directors comprise the company's
Audit Committee, which meets at least quarterly and is responsible for reviewing
and monitoring the company's financial and accounting practices.  In order to
insure and maintain complete independence, Arthur Andersen LLP and the company's
General Auditor have access to meet alone with the Audit Committee, which also
meets with the company's management to discuss financial matters, auditing and
internal accounting controls.

        The company's systems are designed to provide an effective system of
internal accounting controls to obtain reasonable assurance at reasonable cost
that assets are safeguarded from material loss or unauthorized use and
transactions are executed in accordance with management's authorization and
properly recorded.  To this end, management maintains an internal control
environment which is shaped by established operating policies and procedures, an
appropriate division of responsibility at all organizational levels, and a
corporate ethics policy which is monitored annually.  The company also has an
Internal Control Evaluation Committee, comprised primarily of senior management
from the Accounting and Auditing Departments, which oversees the evaluation of
internal controls on a company-wide basis.  Management believes it has
appropriately responded to the internal auditors' and independent public
accountants' recommendations concerning the company's internal control system.

COMMENTS ON QUARTERLY RESULTS

In further explanation of and supplemental to the quarterly results, the 1995
fourth quarter LIFO adjustment was a credit of $3,350,000 compared to a 1994
credit of $14,335,000.  If the 1995 interim results were adjusted to reflect the
actual inventory inflation rates and inventory levels at August 31, 1995,
earnings per share would have been higher in each of the first two quarters by
$.01, and lower in the fourth quarter by $.02.  Similar adjustments in 1994
would have increased earnings per share in each of the first two quarters by
$.02 and decreased the fourth quarter by $.04.
