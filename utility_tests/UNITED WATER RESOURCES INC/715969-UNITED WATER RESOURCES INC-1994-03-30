ITEM 1.   BUSINESS
- -------   --------
(A)       GENERAL
          -------

          United Water Resources Inc. (United Water) was incorporated on
February 25, 1983.  United Water is a New Jersey corporation with its principal
office at 200 Old Hook Road, Harrington Park, New Jersey 07640, telephone number
201-784-9434.  The principal subsidiary of United Water, Hackensack Water
Company (Hackensack), was incorporated by an act of the New Jersey Legislature
in 1869.  A number of local water companies have been merged into Hackensack
since its reorganization in 1880.  Spring Valley Water Company Incorporated
(Spring Valley) was incorporated under the laws of New York in 1893 and is
wholly owned by Hackensack.  Other wholly-owned subsidiaries of United Water
include Rivervale Realty Company, Inc.  (Rivervale), which is engaged in real
estate acquisitions and development, leasing and sales, golf course operations
and consulting activities; Laboratory Resources, Inc. (Laboratory Resources), a
network of private laboratories that provide a variety of laboratory testing
services; and Mid-Atlantic Utilities Corporation (Mid-Atlantic), which seeks
high growth areas in need of public water or sewer systems and the management
necessary to maintain them and is involved with the service and installation of
meters.  United Water also owns 50% of the common stock of the Dundee Water
Power and Land Company.

          Hackensack and Spring Valley, engaged solely in the water service
business, provide water service to residential, commercial and industrial
customers and fire protection within their franchise territories.  Hackensack
and Spring Valley are subject to regulation by the New Jersey Board of
Regulatory Commissioners (BRC) and the New York Public Service Commission (PSC),
respectively.  At December 31, 1993, the distribution facility that provides
water service to these utilities is comprised of approximately 2,955 miles of
pipeline.
<PAGE>
 
                          United Water Resources Inc.

          Hackensack supplies water service to 175,044 customers in 60 New
Jersey municipalities in most of Bergen County and in the northern part of
Hudson County.  The total population served is about 750,000 persons (1990
Census).

          Hackensack's principal source of water supply is the Hackensack River
and its tributary streams, with a watershed of 113 square miles above the dam at
Oradell, New Jersey, together with diversions into the Oradell Reservoir from an
additional 55 square miles of watershed on the Saddle River, Long Swamp Brook
and Sparkill Creek.  The water supply of Hackensack is supplemented by ground
water supplies derived from wells and by the purchase of water from the systems
of Jersey City and the Passaic Valley Water Commission.  Hackensack obtains
stream flow benefits from Spring Valley which owns and operates an impounding
reservoir, Lake DeForest, on the Hackensack River in Rockland County, New York.
In addition, Hackensack has available additional water supply from the Wanaque
South Project.  The Wanaque South Project, which was completed in 1987, was the
joint undertaking of Hackensack and the North Jersey District Water Supply
Commission.  Hackensack has a 50% interest in the utility plant of the project
and shares project operating expenses.

          Spring Valley supplies water service to 59,508 customers in
substantially all of Rockland County, New York, outside of the Palisades
Interstate Park and the areas served by the water systems of the Villages of
Nyack and Suffern.  Its service area extends from Tomkins Cove on the north,
south to the New Jersey state line and comprises about 121 square miles, with a
population of about 250,000 persons (1990 Census).  Spring Valley's principal
source of supply is derived from wells and surface supplies, including Lake
DeForest Reservoir and Cedar Pond Brook.
<PAGE>
 
                          United Water Resources Inc.

          Hackensack and Spring Valley have valid franchises authorizing them to
conduct their present operations in all or substantially all of the territories
in which services are rendered and to maintain their pipes in the streets and
highways of these territories.  Hackensack and Spring Valley have the right to
secure their supplies of water from their present sources.  All such franchises
and rights are subject to alteration, suspension or repeal by the States of New
Jersey and New York, respectively.  Their properties are also subject to the
exercise of the right of eminent domain as provided by law.  Neither Hackensack
nor Spring Valley engages in any significant operations outside its franchised
territories.

          The business of Hackensack and Spring Valley is substantially free
from direct competition with other public utilities, municipalities and other
general public agencies.  Both Hackensack and Spring Valley provide water that
meets or surpasses the minimum standards of the Federal Safe Drinking Water Act
of 1974, as amended.

          Rivervale is a non-regulated business engaged in real estate
acquisitions and development, leasing and sales, golf course operations and
consulting activities.  Rivervale owns raw and income producing properties in
Bergen and Essex Counties, New Jersey; and Orange, Westchester and Rockland
Counties, New York.  Rivervale continues to seek and receive municipal and other
governmental approvals for several projects, both in New Jersey and New York.
Out of its total holdings of approximately 767 acres, various approvals have
been received for 198 acres of property in several parcels in northern New
Jersey and Rockland County, New York.  Applications are pending for projects on
another 137 acres.

          Laboratory Resources performs a wide range of environmental analyses
for consulting engineers, industry, public water suppliers, wastewater treatment
facilities and governmental agencies.  In 1993, Laboratory Resources received
U.S. Army and Navy environmental cleanup certifications allowing them to enter
into a new growing market.  In December 1993, Laboratory Resources was awarded a
$1 million Army base cleanup contract.  Negotiations for other federal contracts
are in progress.

                          United Water Resources Inc.

          Mid-Atlantic owns and operates several small water and sewerage
utility systems.  These include water supply, sewage collection and sewage
transmission companies providing service for approximately 2,752 customers in
Vernon Township and Mt. Arlington, New Jersey.  Mid-Atlantic is subject to
regulation by the BRC.  At December 31, 1993, its distribution facility is
comprised of approximately 26 miles of pipeline.  Through the acquisitions of
several small companies, Mid-Atlantic expects to add approximately 900
additional customers early in 1994.

          In 1993, Metering Services Inc. sold its high technology division and
retained the water meter installation division.

          United Water and its subsidiaries employed 706 persons as of December
31, 1993.

   (C)                           MERGER AGREEMENT
                                 ----------------
</TABLE>

               In September 1993, United Water and GWC Corporation (GWC), a
     Delaware water utility holding company, entered into a definitive agreement
     and plan of merger (Merger Agreement), pursuant to which GWC will merge
     with and into United Water.  The Merger Agreement provides that 70% of each
     holder's GWC common stock will be converted into the right to receive 1.2
     shares of United Water common stock and the remaining 30% will be converted
     at the election of the holder thereof into the right to receive either 1.2
     shares United Water Series A Cumulative Convertible Preference Stock or an
     equivalent amount in cash.  At December 31, 1993, United Water and GWC had
     20,216,000 and 11,066,600 shares of common stock outstanding, respectively.
     In addition, the outstanding GWC Series A 7-5/8% Cumulative Preferred Stock
     would be converted into shares of United Water preferred stock with equal
     stated dividends and similar rights and designations.
<PAGE>
 
                          United Water Resources Inc.

               The Merger Agreement contains various provisions with respect to
     the conduct of each company's business pending consummation of the merger,
     such as prohibiting increases in United Water's common stock quarterly
     dividend above $.23 per share.  Such provisions are not expected to have an
     adverse effect on United Water and its subsidiaries or limit the ability of
     United Water or its subsidiaries to operate in any material way.

               Discussions contained in the following pages of this Report
     (except where noted) pertain to United Water and its subsidiaries, and
     projections or estimates contained therein do not reflect the pending
     merger.  For additional information on the merger, reference is made to
     United Water's Form 8-K's dated September 16, 1993 and March 10, 1994,
     which are filed as exhibits to this Report and incorporated herein by
     reference. On March 10, 1994 United Water announced that the shareholders
     of United Water and GWC overwhelmingly approved the companies' merger
     agreement at independently conducted shareholder meetings held that day.

     ITEM 2.          PROPERTIES
     -------          ----------

               Hackensack owns and operates two impounding reservoirs, Oradell
     (3,507 million gallon (MG) capacity) and Woodcliff Lake (871 MG capacity)
     located in Bergen County, New Jersey and one impounding reservoir, Lake
     Tappan (3,853 MG capacity), partially located in Bergen County, New Jersey
     and partially located in Rockland County, New York.  In addition,
     Hackensack obtains stream flow benefits from Spring Valley, which owns and
     operates an additional impounding reservoir, Lake DeForest (5,671 MG
     capacity), on the Hackensack River in Rockland County.  The Wanaque South
     Project adds as much as 40 million gallons per day (MGD) to Hackensack's
     water supply.

               Hackensack and Spring Valley own and operate numerous wells
     throughout their systems.  Hackensack also owns and operates a treatment
     and pumping plant at the Oradell Reservoir, which is comprised of raw and
     filtered water pumping facilities and purification works.  This plant has
     raw and filtered water pumping capabilities in excess of 200 MGD.  At
     Secaucus, New Jersey, Hackensack owns and operates a treatment and pumping
     plant for water supplied from the Jersey City aqueduct.  This plant is
     capable of treating 18 MGD.  Spring Valley has a pumping and treatment
     plant adjacent to Lake DeForest Reservoir, in the Town of Clarkstown, New
     York, with a capability of 20 MGD.  A small pumping station and pressure
     filter plant, with a capacity of 1.5 MGD, located in the Town of Stony
     Point, New York, treats water from Cedar Pond Brook.

               Hackensack and Spring Valley own and maintain various reservoirs,
     standpipes, elevated tanks, transmission and distribution mains, hydrants,
     services and meters throughout the distribution system, including booster
     pump stations.  In connection with the Wanaque South Project, Hackensack
     owns a 17-mile aqueduct from the Wanaque Reservoir to the Oradell
     Reservoir, along with a booster pumping station.  Hackensack also owns 50%

               On January 6, 1987, Spring Valley received New York State
     Department of Environmental Conservation (DEC) approval to build the
     proposed Ambrey Project, an impounding reservoir and treatment plant.
     However, construction of the project cannot begin until Spring Valley's
     water demands have reached a certain "trigger point" as determined by
     average daily water demands.  On April 19, 1993, the Company requested the
     DEC's permission to adjust the Ambrey trigger mechanism to reflect current
     conditions and water demand characteristics.  A decision on this matter is
     pending.

               Hackensack and Spring Valley own and occupy office buildings in
     Harrington Park and Hackensack, New Jersey; and in West Nyack, New York,
     respectively.

               Rivervale owns approximately 767 acres of land and three (3)
     major office buildings.  Its properties are located in Bergen and Essex
     Counties, New Jersey; and Orange, Westchester and Rockland Counties, New
     York.

               Laboratory Resources owns and operates three (3) commercial
     testing laboratories in Teterboro, New Jersey; Brooklyn, Connecticut; and
     Bethlehem, Pennsylvania.

               Mid-Atlantic owns and operates public water supply, sewage
     collection and sewage transmission companies in Morris and Sussex Counties,
     New Jersey.

     ITEM 3.  LEGAL  PROCEEDINGS
     -------  ------------------

               On January 12, 1990, the New Jersey Board of Public Utilities
     (BPU), predecessor of the Board of Regulatory Commissioners (BRC), and the
     New Jersey Watershed Property Review Board (WRB) approved Hackensack's
     transfer of approximately 290 acres of excess golf course land to
     Rivervale.  Thereafter, two environmental advocacy groups, the
     Environmental Defense Fund (EDF) and Save the Watershed Action Network
     (SWAN), filed a consolidated appeal with New Jersey's Appellate Division
     contesting the approval.  In June 1991, the Appellate Division remanded the
     matter back to the BPU and the WRB for further proceedings.  Thereafter,
     Hackensack sought Certification to the Supreme Court of New Jersey.
     However, on October 30, 1991, the Supreme Court decided that it would not
     entertain that appeal.

               On February 5, 1991, the BPU denied a petition by the EDF for an
     enforcement order regarding development of the watershed lands, and in the
     alternative, a petition for reconsideration of the December 17, 1984 BPU
     decision approving transfer of approximately 717 acres from Hackensack to
     Rivervale.  The February 5 Order also established a buffer zone of 500 feet
     for certain parcels of the property.  On February 20, 1991, the EDF filed a
     Notice of Appeal to the New Jersey Appellate Division contesting the
     February 5 Order denying the reconsideration.  Hackensack Water Company
     subsequently filed a cross appeal contesting the February 5 Order, solely
     as it related to the 500 foot buffer zone segment.

               On June 3, 1993, Hackensack and Rivervale executed a stipulation
     and agreement with EDF/SWAN, the Staff of the BRC and the New Jersey
     Department of the Public Advocate's office settling the above litigation
     subject to approval by the WRB and the BRC.  The stipulation reinstates the
     transfer of the Golf Course Lands to Rivervale while providing for
     reacquisition by Hackensack of 355 acres transferred to Rivervale in 1984.

                          United Water Resources Inc.

               Based upon decisions rendered from the WRB on July 6, 1993 and
     the BRC on August 5, 1993, several lawsuits were settled between Hackensack
     and two environmental groups related to the land transfers that occurred in
     1984 and 1990.

               The settlement upheld the 1990 transfer from Hackensack to
     Rivervale of approximately 290 acres of land that are unconditionally and
     permanently deed restricted to golf course and country club uses.  The
     settlement also required Hackensack to reacquire 355 acres of land which
     were transferred to Rivervale in 1984.  This acreage was added to
     Hackensack's reservoir protective holdings and rate base.

               The transfer price of the acreage being returned to Hackensack's
     plant accounts was valued at $26 million, reflecting development approvals
     that occurred during the nine years that the land was held by Rivervale.
     Approximately $11 million (which includes interest) in proceeds from the
     1990 golf course transfer to Rivervale was deferred for refund to water
     customers.  To permanently reduce the rate impact of the reacquisition by
     Hackensack of the 355 acres, $4 million of the proceeds was applied against
     the utility plant accounts, resulting in a net increase in utility rate
     base of $22 million.  The remaining $7 million of the proceeds will be
     applied as credits on customer bills to completely offset the impact of the
     rate increase of approximately 3.1%, or $3.5 million, which became
     effective October 12, 1993, in recognition of the increment to Hackensack's
     rate base.  It is anticipated that the credits on customer bills will be
     made for approximately two years.  Due to regulatory treatment, the effects
     of the intercompany transaction were not eliminated in consolidation.  As a
     result of the settlement, Rivervale recognized sales proceeds of $26
     million offset by costs of approximately $15.5 million associated with the
     land.

               In a separate matter, an appeal was filed with New Jersey's
     Intermediate Appellate Court by the Division of Rate Counsel, Department of
     the Public Advocate, from a 1990 BPU Order relating to the Petition of
     Hackensack for approval of a grant of a ground lease to Sterling Drug
     Capital Corporation, approving the long-term lease of certain Hackensack
     property for use as part of a golf course.  The appeal contested those
     provisions of the Order directing that revenues realized from the lease be
     shared equally
<PAGE>
 
                          United Water Resources Inc.

     between Hackensack's shareholders and customers, and sought to have the
     lease proceeds inure to the exclusive benefit of the customers.  The matter
     was argued before the Appellate Division and a decision was rendered on
     February 11, 1993, affirming the 1990 BPU Order.

               The Paterson Municipal Utilities Authority filed suit against the
     Hackensack Water Company and the North Jersey District Water Supply
     Commission.  Summons and Complaint were served on August 8, 1990.  The suit
     was based on alleged ownership of various water rights in the Passaic River
     owned by the Authority and which the Authority claimed were, or may have
     been, affected by diversions from the Wanaque South Project, in which
     Hackensack Water Company is an equal partner with the North Jersey District
     Water Supply Commission.  The Company's Motion for Summary Judgement,
     dismissing the Complaint, was granted on July 23, 1992.  On October 5,
     1992, the Paterson Municipal Utilities Authority filed a Notice of Appeal.
     The Appeal is pending.

               The PSC, on February 20, 1985, authorized the sale and transfer
     of 23 acres of land from Spring Valley to Rivervale.  Subsequently, the PSC
     initiated an administrative proceeding arising from an Order inquiring into
     the price for the transfer of the land.  In September 1990, the PSC
     required Spring Valley to record a deferred credit that reduced rate base
     by $1.2 million to reflect the appreciated value of the property as of the
     date of sale of the land.  In January of 1991, Spring Valley filed an
     appeal regarding the PSC decision; however, on February 13, 1992, the
     Appellate Division affirmed the action of the PSC.  The effect of that
     decision on United Water has been recognized by an after-tax charge against
     income of $809,000 in 1991.  The Company filed with the New York Court of
     Appeals a Motion for Leave to Appeal, which was denied on September 17,
     1992.  The Company has submitted a proposal to the PSC to make a one-time
     customer refund through billed credits of a portion of the deferred credit.
     The Company anticipates a PSC decision on its request in April 1994.

               On August 6, 1991, Rivervale Realty entered into a modification
     agreement relating to the outstanding proceeds being held in escrow from
     the sale of the Emerson Country Club.  The modification
<PAGE>
 
                          United Water Resources Inc.

     provided for additional collateral to secure the purchase, the loan of the
     escrow monies in the amount of $13.1 million to the Buyer, and a release of
     the remaining portion of the escrow funds in the amount of $4.4 million to
     Rivervale. The release to the Buyer is secured by a note and mortgage on
     the Country Club and certain other properties owned by the Buyer, together
     with a guaranty from the Buyer's parent company, as additional security for
     the substitution of collateral. The Buyer failed to make its scheduled
     March 1992 and all subsequent payments, and as a result, the note was
     placed in a non-accrual status. Rivervale has begun an action in
     foreclosure, which the Buyer has challenged. By Superior Court Order dated
     February 10, 1993 Rivervale was awarded possession of the course and
     operated the facility during the 1993 season. On March 18, 1994 Rivervale
     and Bird Hills entered into a stipulation of settlement whereby Rivervale
     would pay Bird Hills $2 million in return for additional property acquired
     by Bird Hills. The stipulation also requires Bird Hills to give up all
     claims to the golf course parcel. The closing of the settlement is
     tentatively scheduled for March 30, 1994.

               Based upon advice from counsel, management believes Hackensack,
     Spring Valley and Rivervale have meritorious defenses in all of the
     aforementioned claims which remain pending and intends to contest them
     vigorously.  The likelihood that the ultimate resolution will have a
     material effect upon the financial position or results of operations of
     United Water or its subsidiaries is considered to be remote.

     -------   -----------------------------------------------------------------
               AND  RESULTS  OF  OPERATIONS
               ----------------------------
     LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES
     CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS

               United Water Resources' (United Water) existing utility
     subsidiaries expect to spend $89 million on construction programs over the
     next five years.  Expenditures in 1994 and 1995 are projected to be $16.4
     million and $18.1 million, respectively.  These estimates are subject to
     continuous review and actual expenditures may vary.  The construction
     programs include the installation of transmission and distribution
     facilities.

               The utilities plan to continue to fund their construction
     programs primarily through internal cash generation.  Additional funding,
     as necessary, will be obtained through the sale of securities, available
     credit lines, and capital infusions by United Water from its dividend
     reinvestment and stock purchase plans.  The amount and timing of the use of
     these proceeds and of future financings will depend on actual construction
     expenditures, the timeliness and adequacy of rate relief, the availability
     and cost of capital, and the ability to meet interest and fixed charge
     coverage requirements.

               In 1991, United Water implemented two enhancements to its
     dividend reinvestment and stock purchase plans.  The first allows plan
     participants to make additional cash investments in United Water shares at
     a 5% discount from market price with no brokerage fees.  The second
     provides our utility customers with a 5% discount on their initial
     investment.  The amount received from all plans was:  1993-$20.5 million;
     1992-$17.3 million; 1991-$9.7 million.

               In July 1993, Hackensack Water Company (Hackensack) redeemed $10
     million of its $20 million, 9-3/4% Series First Mortgage Bonds, due 2006.
     Hackensack redeemed the remaining $10 million in January 1994.  In 1993,
     Hackensack filed a petition requesting the New Jersey Board of Regulatory
     Commissioners' (BRC) approval to issue and sell $40 million of tax-exempt
     refunding bonds.
<PAGE>
 
                          United Water Resources Inc.

     Hackensack received BRC approval in February 1994 and plans to use the
     proceeds of the issue to redeem $20 million 8-3/4% bonds and $20 million 8%
     bonds in 1994.  On March 22, 1994, Hackensack issued $20 million 5.80% 1994
     Series A term bonds and $20 million 5.9% 1994 Series B term bonds, due
     March 1, 2024.

               In November 1993, Rivervale Realty Company (Rivervale) reduced
     its existing $9.5 million Atrium building mortgage by $1.5 million and
     refinanced the remaining $8.0 million with a floating rate term loan, due
     2000.  The interest rate will be established every 30 days and is based on
     London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR) plus a premium (4.25% at December 31,
     1993).

               In December 1993, the New York State Environmental Facilities
     Corporation (EFC) issued $12 million of 5.65% tax-exempt Water Facilities
     Revenue Bonds (1993 Bonds) due in 2023 with optional redemption provisions
     on behalf of Spring Valley Water Company Incorporated (Spring Valley).  The
     proceeds will be used to finance certain construction projects through
     1995.

               At December 31, 1993, United Water had available $57.5 million of
     unused short-term bank lines of credit and $9 million in cash and temporary
     investments.

     MERGER
     ------
               On September 15, 1993, United Water entered into a definitive
     agreement to merge with GWC Corporation (GWC), a company based in
     Wilmington, Delaware.  GWC is the parent company of General Waterworks
     Corporation (General Waterworks), a utility holding company.  Under the
     terms of the agreement, GWC will merge into United Water so that General
     Waterworks will become a wholly-owned subsidiary of United Water through an
     exchange of common stock, convertible preference stock, and cash for GWC
     common stock.  The total value of the transaction is approximately $196
     million.  Lyonnaise des Eaux-Dumez (Lyonnaise), the majority shareholder of
     GWC, will receive 70% of its consideration in common stock of United Water
     at a ratio of 1.2 shares of United Water to 1 share of GWC
<PAGE>
 
                          United Water Resources Inc.

     and the remaining 30% in convertible preference stock.  The minority
     shareholders of GWC will receive 70% of their consideration in common stock
     of United Water at a ratio of 1.2 shares of United Water to 1 share of GWC.
     They will also have a choice of taking the remaining 30% in either (i) cash
     equal to 1.2 times the average market price of United Water common stock on
     the New York Stock Exchange for 20 trading days prior to the closing, or
     (ii) an equivalent value of United Water convertible preference stock.  The
     merger is expected to be tax free to the extent common shareholders of GWC
     receive common stock or preference stock of United Water.

               On November 30, 1993, the boards of directors of United Water and
     GWC voted to proceed with the proposed merger subject to various closing
     conditions. These include approvals from the shareholders of both companies
     and certain state regulatory agencies.  A registration statement (S-4) and
     joint proxy statement was filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission
     on February 3, 1994.  On March 10, 1994, special shareholder meetings of
     both companies were held to vote on the merger proposal, resulting in the
     shareholders of United Water and GWC overwhelmingly approving the
     companies' merger agreement.

               Lyonnaise, a French multi-national corporation and one of
     Europe's largest water purveyors, currently owns approximately 82% of GWC
     shares.  Lyonnaise voted its shares for the merger in the same proportion
     as the minority shareholders of GWC. Under the terms of the agreement,
     Lyonnaise will own approximately 26% of the outstanding United Water shares
     after the merger. Lyonnaise will enter into a 12-year Governance Agreement
     with United Water which, subject to certain conditions, will govern the
     relationship of the parties.

               As a result of the merger, United Water will become the second
     largest investor-owned water utility in the country.  The service territory
     will serve more than 2 million people in 14 states.  Utility operating
     revenues are anticipated to double and consolidated assets are expected to
     exceed $1 billion.

     RATE MATTERS

     SPRING VALLEY

               In 1990 and 1989, Spring Valley deferred revenues totaling
     $505,000 and $1.2 million, respectively, related to reductions in pension
     expense and federal income tax rates pursuant to a New York Public Service
     Commission (PSC) order.  As a result of the September 1990 rate application
     settlement with the PSC, Spring Valley began to refund these revenues to
     customers.  In February 1993, Spring Valley implemented a September 1992
     PSC decision which revised its tariff design and discontinued the
     application of federal income tax revenue credits on customer bills.
     Spring Valley is using unamortized revenue deferrals to recover the cost of
     a customer conservation program which began in the second quarter of 1993
     and is anticipated to conclude in 1995.

               In July 1992, Spring Valley applied to the PSC for permission to
     increase its annual revenues by $5 million, or 14.4%, to offset the effects
     of continued investment in plant facilities and increases in operating
     expenses.  On May 12, 1993, the PSC rendered its decision.  The PSC Opinion
     No. 93-9 allowed Spring Valley an overall rate of return of 8.75% and a
     return on equity of 10.5%.  The opinion provided for an increase in annual
     revenues of approximately $1.9 million, or 5.7%, which became effective on
     May 30, 1993.  The PSC also allowed Spring Valley to recover approximately
     $850,000 of previously deferred expenses and required it to refund certain
     revenue credits of approximately $1 million immediately.  This action,
     which resulted in a one-time increase in revenues and various expenses in
     the second quarter of 1993, did not have a material effect on net income.
     The PSC's decision also permitted Spring Valley to submit a second stage
     filing after February 1, 1994 to recover increases in property taxes,
     salaries and wages, and medical benefits that were not provided for in
     their previous determination.  In addition, in its second stage filing,
     Spring Valley will seek rate recognition of its other postretirement
     benefits on an accrual basis.  In February 1994, Spring Valley filed a

     increase revenues by approximately $1.6 million, or 4.4%.  Spring Valley
     anticipates a PSC decision on its request in April 1994.

               The PSC's May 1993 decision also directed Spring Valley to
     institute a Revenue Reconciliation Clause (RRC), which requires Spring
     Valley to reconcile billed revenues with the pro forma revenues that were
     used to set rates.  Any variances outside a 1% range are accrued or
     deferred for subsequent recovery from or refund to customers.  As a result
     of the hot weather experienced during the summer of 1993, the RRC resulted
     in the deferral of $1.4 million, which will be used to recover certain
     deferred costs.  The remaining balance will be refunded to Spring Valley
     customers along with previous RRC credit balances over a three-year period
     beginning in July 1994.

               In 1990, the PSC modified its earlier decision regarding the 1985
     transfer of 23 acres of land from Spring Valley to Rivervale.  They ordered
     Spring Valley to record a deferred credit that reduced rate base by $1.9
     million.  In 1991, Spring Valley filed an appeal with the New York State
     Supreme Court-Appellate Division.  In February 1992, a decision was
     rendered on the appeal affirming the PSC order.  The effect of that
     decision on United Water has been recognized by an after-tax charge against
     income of $809,000 in 1991.  Spring Valley has submitted a proposal to the
     PSC to make a one-time customer refund through bill credits of a portion of
     the deferred credit.  A PSC decision is anticipated in April 1994.

     HACKENSACK WATER

               Based upon decisions that were rendered by the New Jersey
     Watershed Property Review Board on July 6, 1993, and the BRC on August 5,
     1993, several lawsuits were settled between Hackensack and two
     environmental groups related to the land transfers that occurred in 1984
     and 1990.

               The settlement upheld the 1990 transfer from Hackensack to
     Rivervale of approximately 290 acres of land that are unconditionally and
     permanently deed restricted to golf course and country club
<PAGE>
 
                          United Water Resources Inc.

     uses.  The settlement also required Hackensack to reacquire 355 acres of
     land which were transferred to Rivervale in 1984.  This acreage was added
     to Hackensack's reservoir protective holdings and rate base.

               The transfer price of the acreage being returned to Hackensack's
     plant accounts was valued at $26 million, reflecting development approvals
     that occurred during the nine years that the land was held by Rivervale.
     Approximately $11 million (which includes interest) in proceeds from the
     1990 golf course transfer to Rivervale was deferred for refund to
     Hackensack customers.  To permanently reduce the rate impact of the
     reacquisition by Hackensack of the 355 acres, $4 million of the proceeds
     was applied against the utility plant accounts resulting in a net increase
     in utility rate base of $22 million.  The remaining $7 million of the
     proceeds are being applied as credits on customer bills to completely
     offset the impact of the rate increase of approximately 3.1%, or $3.5
     million, which became effective October 12, 1993, in recognition of the
     increment to Hackensack's rate base.  It is anticipated that the credits on
     customer bills will be made for approximately two years.  Due to regulatory
     treatment, the effects of the intercompany transaction were not eliminated
     in consolidation.

     REAL ESTATE ACTIVITIES

               The intercompany land transfer settlement discussed above had a
     positive impact on Rivervale's revenues.  Rivervale continues to receive
     municipal and other governmental approvals for projects in New Jersey and
     New York.  Various approvals have been received pertaining to 198 acres of
     property in several parcels in northern New Jersey and southern New York.
     Rivervale is pursuing joint ventures, sales, or direct development
     opportunities for selected properties in its portfolio.  Applications are
     pending for projects on another 137 acres.

               Funding for Rivervale's real estate activities is anticipated to
     be obtained from internally generated funds from the sales of properties,
     rental income, revenues from golf course operations, consulting activities,
     and borrowings and advances from United Water, as required.  The timing and
<PAGE>
 
                          United Water Resources Inc.

     magnitude of additional funding for development activities will depend upon
     the attainment of necessary approvals and market conditions.

               Rivervale currently projects spending $27 million over the next
     five years for capital expenditures on its existing portfolio.
     Expenditures in 1994 and 1995 are projected to be $4.8 million and $2.5
     million, respectively.  Funding for these expenditures is projected to be
     available from internally generated cash.

     RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

     OVERVIEW

               United Water's consolidated net income for 1993 of $20 million
     increased 27% from $15.8 million in 1992.  Net income per common share for
     1993 was $1.03 versus 87 cents for the same period last year, despite a
     6.9% rise in the average number of common shares outstanding.  This
     increase in consolidated net income is primarily attributable to the
     settlement of litigation surrounding the land transfers as well as the
     contribution from utility operations.

     REVENUES
               The increases (decreases) in revenues from the prior periods are
     attributable to the following factors:

               The rate impact of 1.2% in utility revenues in 1993 resulted from
     a 5.7% Spring Valley rate increase in May 1993, a 3.1% Hackensack rate
     increase in October 1993 and the recognition of approximately $1 million of
     deferred revenue credits relating to Spring Valley's rate case.

               The 5.6% consumption impact on utility revenues in 1993 is
     attributable to the 6.8% and 4.6% increase in Hackensack's and Spring
     Valley's consumption, respectively, due to an unusually warm and dry
     summer.  Pursuant to the PSC Revenue Reconciliation Clause, Spring Valley
     deferred $1.4 million of revenues in 1993.

               The $23.2 million or 14.1% increase in real estate revenues was
     the result of a $26 million land transfer between Hackensack and Rivervale,
     offset by reduced revenues of land sales to third parties.

               Total revenues in 1992 were 1.9% above those in 1991, reflecting
     the contribution of approximately $4.7 million from real estate sales and
     $2 million from rental activities and reduced customer usage compared with
     1991, when the utilities set new daily pumping records during a dry summer.

COSTS AND EXPENSES

               The changes in operating expenses from the prior years were due
     to the following:

<TABLE>
<CAPTION>
 OPERATION AND MAINTENANCE EXPENSES   1993 VS. 1992    1992 VS. 1991
                                      --------------  ----------------

   (thousands of dollars)
- ------------------------------------
 
   Operation                          $24,689  37.8%  $ 2,043     3.2%
   Maintenance                            527   5.4%      755     8.3%
 
       Operation and Maintenance       25,216  33.5%    2,798     3.9%
 
   Depreciation                           326   2.3%      801     6.1%
   General taxes                      $ 1,163   4.0%  $(1,332)  (4.4%)
- ------------------------------------  -------  ----   -------   -----
</TABLE>

               Operation and maintenance expenses increased $25.2 million or
     33.5% from 1992.  This increase is primarily due to expenses related to the
     cost of the transferred real estate of $15.5 million, a $4.1 million
     valuation reserve relating to Rivervale properties, and the recognition of
     deferred expenses relating to the Spring Valley rate case of approximately
     $850,000.  Higher operational expenses due to greater system demands,
     contracted labor costs, and higher salaries and wages also contributed to
     this increase.  The 3.9% increase in 1992 over 1991 was primarily
     attributable to costs of property sold associated with real estate
     activities.

               Depreciation increased by 2.3% in 1993 and 6.1% in 1992.  The
     higher depreciation expense in both years was primarily due to additional
     facilities placed in service and the application of higher utility
     depreciation rates resulting from Hackensack's rate settlement, which was
     effective in the second quarter of 1991, and the increase in Spring
     Valley's composite rates from 2% to 2.2% in the second quarter of 1993.

               General taxes increased $1.2 million, or 4%, over 1992, due
     principally to higher revenue based taxes of 2.1% and an increase of 8.4%
     in property related taxes.  The decline in general taxes of $1.3 million,
     or 4.4%, in 1992 from 1991 is mainly attributable to the 9.4% decrease in
     revenue based taxes which was offset by a 13.7% increase in property
     related taxes.

     INTEREST AND OTHER

               Consolidated interest expense decreased 1% in 1993 from 1992 and
     2% from 1991, due to lower interest rates on short-term borrowings, the
     reduction of long-term debt and an increase in short-term borrowings.

               In 1992, the allowance for funds used during construction
     decreased 32% from 1991 following the recognition of additional
     expenditures related to utility plant being placed in service.

               Other income in 1992 decreased 49% from 1991, due to a reduction
     in interest rates, average temporary cash investments and funds held on
     deposit.

     INCOME TAXES

               The effective income tax rates on income before preferred stock
     dividends were 36% in 1993, 31.1% in 1992 and 31.3% in 1991.  In 1993, the
     provision for income taxes increased $4.5 million, or 56.2% over 1992, due
     mainly to the effect of the land transfer, higher water sales, the Spring
     Valley rate decision and the increase in the federal income tax rate.  The
     rate decision resulted in the recognition of deferred IRS audit adjustments
     of $946,000 relating to the previously settled 1981 through 1988 IRS audit.
     In 1992, the provision for income taxes decreased 1% from 1991 primarily as
     the result of lower pre-tax earnings.  An analysis of income taxes is
     included in Note 10 to the financial statements.

     EFFECTS OF INFLATION

               Operating income from utility operations is normally not
     materially affected by inflation because cost increases generally lead to
     proportionate increases in revenues allowed through the regulatory process.
     However, there is a lag in the recovery of higher expenses through the
     regulatory process, and therefore, high inflation could have a detrimental
     effect on the company until rate increases are received.

                          United Water Resources Inc.

     Conversely, lower inflation and lower interest rates tend to result in
     reductions in the rates of return allowed by the utility commissions, as
     has happened over the last several years.

     The Board of Directors
     United Water Resources



             In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements listed in the
     accompanying index present fairly, in all material respects, the financial
     position of United Water Resources and its subsidiaries at December 31,
     1993 and 1992, and the results of their operations and their cash flows for
     each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 1993, in
     conformity with generally accepted accounting principles. These financial
     statements are the responsibility of the Company's management; our
     responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements based
     on our audits. We conducted our audits of these statements in accordance
     with generally accepted auditing standards which require that we plan and
     perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the
     financial statements are free of material misstatement. An audit includes
     examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures
     in the financial statements, assessing the accounting principles used and
     significant estimates made by management, and evaluating the overall
     financial statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a
     reasonable basis for the opinion expressed above.

             As discussed in Notes 8 and 10 to the consolidated financial
     statements, the Company changed its method of accounting for postretirement
     benefits other than pensions and income taxes, effective January 1, 1993.

                          United Water Resources Inc.

                   NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

     NOTE 1 - SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES:

               The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of
     United Water Resources and its wholly owned subsidiaries (United Water).

               United Water's principal utility subsidiaries, Hackensack Water
     Company (Hackensack) and Spring Valley Water Company Incorporated (Spring
     Valley), are subject to regulation by the New Jersey Board of Regulatory
     Commissioners (BRC) and the New York Public Service Commission (PSC),
     respectively.  Their accounting policies comply with the applicable uniform
     systems of accounts prescribed by these regulatory commissions and conform
     to generally accepted accounting principles as applied to rate regulated
     public utilities, which allows, among other things, the recognition of
     intercompany profit in situations where it is probable such profit will be
     recovered in the ratemaking process.

               UTILITY PLANT:  Utility plant is recorded at cost, which includes
     direct and indirect labor and material costs associated with construction
     activities, related operating overheads and an allowance for funds used
     during construction (AFUDC).  AFUDC is not current cash income; it
     represents the cost of borrowed funds used for construction purposes and a
     reasonable rate on other funds used.  The amount of AFUDC related to equity
     funds was:  1993-$359,000; 1992-$275,000; 1991-$399,000.

               Utility property retired or otherwise disposed of in the normal
     course of business is charged to accumulated depreciation, with salvage
     (net of removal cost) credited thereto, and no gain or loss is recognized.
     The costs of property repairs, replacements and renewals of minor property
     items are included in maintenance expense.

               Utility plant includes Hackensack's 50% interest in the Wanaque
     South Water Supply Project, which, at original cost, totaled $51 million at
     December 31, 1993 and 1992.  The net book value
<PAGE>
 
                          United Water Resources Inc.

     at December 31, 1993 was $46 million and $46.8 million at December 31,
     1992.  Hackensack's share of project operating expenses is included in
     United Water's consolidated operation and maintenance expenses.

               REAL ESTATE:  Real estate properties are carried at the lower of
     cost, which includes original purchase price and direct development costs,
     or net realizable value.  Real estate taxes and interest costs are
     capitalized during the development period.  The amount of interest
     capitalized in 1993 was $2.6 million and $3 million in 1992 and 1991.  Real
     estate operating revenues include rental income, proceeds from the
     disposition of real estate properties and revenues from golf course
     operations.

               Proceeds and costs related to pending real estate transactions
     which do not qualify as completed sales for accounting purposes have been
     recorded under the deposit method.  At December 31, 1993 and 1992, pending
     proceeds of approximately $17 million have been recorded as deferred
     credits.

               UNAMORTIZED DEBT EXPENSE:  Debt premium, debt discount and debt
     expense are amortized to income over the lives of the applicable issues.

               PREPAID AND DEFERRED EMPLOYEE BENEFITS:  As of December 31, 1993,
     the prepaid employee benefits include $5.9 million of prepaid pension costs
     and $4.6 million of prepaid and deferred postretirement health care
     benefits.  Most of the postretirement costs relate to employees and
     retirees of Hackensack and Spring Valley.  Hackensack and Spring Valley
     have been advised by the BRC and PSC, respectively, that they are allowed
     to defer accrued postretirement health care costs in excess of amounts
     included in rates.  At December 31, 1993, $3.4 million was deferred for
     recovery in future rates.

               REVENUES:  Hackensack records on its books the estimated amount
     of accrued but unbilled revenues.  Spring Valley does not accrue unbilled
     revenues.  Spring Valley currently has $3.8 million of unamortized revenue
     deferrals which are available to offset other incremental deferred costs or
     be refunded to customers over a three-year period.  Pursuant to PSC orders,
     Spring Valley refunded $2.3 million, $1.4 million, and $1.9 million of
     these revenues to customers in 1993, 1992, and 1991, respectively.  Spring
     Valley also deferred revenues of $1.4 million, $392,000, and $1.9 million
     in 1993, 1992, and 1991,
<PAGE>
 
                          United Water Resources Inc.

     respectively.  These deferrals were related to revenues in excess of
     amounts allowed in rates, reductions in federal income taxes and reductions
     in pension expenses.

               DEPRECIATION:  Depreciation of plant and real estate properties
     is computed on the straight-line method based on the estimated service
     lives of the properties.  Utility plant depreciation rates are prescribed
     by the regulatory commissions.  The provisions for depreciation in 1993,
     1992 and 1991 were equivalent to 2.2%, 2.2%, and 2.1%, respectively, of
     average depreciable utility plant in service.  For federal income tax
     purposes, depreciation is computed using accelerated methods and, in
     general, with shorter depreciable lives as permitted under the Internal
     Revenue Code.

               INCOME TAXES:  United Water files a consolidated federal income
     tax return.  Effective January 1, 1993, the company adopted Statement of
     Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 109, "Accounting for Income
     Taxes."  SFAS No. 109 requires the company to adjust its recorded deferred
     income tax balances to reflect an estimate of its future tax liability
     based on temporary differences between the financial and tax basis of
     assets and liabilities.  This adjustment includes deferred taxes for
     utility temporary differences not previously recognized.  It also includes
     the effect on the liability of changes in tax laws and rates.  The adoption
     of SFAS No. 109 resulted in the recording of a deferred tax liability and
     recoverable income taxes of $20.2 million at January 1, 1993, which is
     reflected on the balance sheet, with no material effect on net income.  The
     recoverable income taxes represent the probable future increase in revenues
     that will be received through future ratemaking proceedings for the
     recovery of these deferred taxes.

               For 1992 and 1991, the provision for income taxes represents the
     estimated amounts payable for the period and net deferred taxes relating to
     differences between income for accounting and tax purposes for certain
     items as discussed in Note 10.  Deferred taxes were provided for timing
     differences between financial and income tax reporting, except where not
     allowed by regulation.

                          United Water Resources Inc.

               Investment tax credits arising from property additions are
     deferred and amortized over the estimated service lives of the related
     properties.

               STATEMENT OF CASH FLOWS:  United Water considers all highly
     liquid investments with original maturities of three months or less to be
     temporary cash investments.

     NOTE 2 - SHORT-TERM BORROWING AGREEMENTS:

               United Water has credit lines with several banks which allow for
     aggregate short-term borrowings of up to $73 million.  Borrowings under
     these credit lines bear interest at a rate between the London Interbank
     Offered Rate (LIBOR) and the prime lending rate.  There was $15.5 million
     outstanding on these lines at December 31, 1993, at interest rates ranging
     from 3.5% to 4.4%.

               United Water maintains balances and pays commitment fees under
     arrangements with certain of these banks to compensate them for services
     and to support these lines of credit.  There are no legal restrictions
     placed on the withdrawal or other use of these bank balances.

     NOTE 3 - LONG-TERM DEBT:

               Long-term debt repayable over the next five years is:  1994-$19.8
     million; 1995-$1.6 million; $1996-$1.7 million; 1997-$12.6 million and
     1998-$3.6 million.  Substantially all of the utility plant is subject to
     first mortgage liens.

               In July 1993, Hackensack redeemed $10 million of its $20 million,
     9-3/4% Series, First Mortgage Bonds, due 2006.  Hackensack redeemed the
     remaining $10 million in January 1994.  In 1993, Hackensack filed a
     petition requesting BRC approval to issue and sell $40 million of tax-
     exempt refunding bonds.  Hackensack received BRC approval in February 1994
     and plans to use the proceeds of the issue to redeem $20 million 8-3/4%
     bonds and $20 million 8% bonds in 1994.  On March 22, 1994, Hackensack
     issued $20 million 5.80% 1994 Series A term bonds and $20 million 5.90%
     1994 Series B term bonds, due March 1, 2024.

               In November 1993, Rivervale reduced its existing $9.5 million
     Atrium building mortgage by $1.5 million and refinanced the remaining $8
     million with a floating rate term loan due 2000.  The interest rate will be
     established every 30 days and is based on LIBOR plus a premium (4.25% at
     December 31, 1993).

               In December 1993, the New York State Environmental Facilities
     Corporation (EFC) issued $12 million of 5.65%, tax-exempt, Water Facilities
     Revenue Bonds (1993 Bonds) due 2023 with optional redemption provisions on
     behalf of Spring Valley to finance construction programs through 1995.  The
     bonds are insured as to the payment of interest and principal by the AMBAC
     Indemnity Corporation.

               In February 1992, Laboratory Resources obtained a $600,000 loan
     to finance leasehold improvements at its new facility.  The loan bears
     interest at a floating prime (6% at December 31, 1993) with a maturity date
     of March 1997.  Principal is payable in monthly installments.

               In May 1991, United Water obtained a $5 million loan to finance
     an investment in an unaffiliated New Jersey water company.  The loan bears
     interest at floating LIBOR (4.8125% at December 31, 1993) with a maturity
     date of October 1994.  Management expects to refinance this loan on a long-
     term basis.

     NOTE 4 - CONSTRUCTION EXPENDITURES:

               The expenditures for the utilities' construction programs over
     the next five years are expected to total $89 million.  Construction
     expenditures for 1994 and 1995 are estimated to be $16.4 million and $18.1
     million, respectively.  Rivervale currently projects spending $27 million
     over the next five years for capital expenditures on its current portfolio.
     Expenditures in 1994 and 1995 are projected to be $4.8 million and $2.5
     million, respectively.

     NOTE 5 - PREFERRED STOCK:

               Cumulative preferred stock of utility subsidiaries with mandatory
     redemption is subject to sinking fund requirements.  These mandatory
     requirements total $260,000 in each of the years 1994 through 1997, and
     total $573,000 in 1998.  In addition, optional sinking fund provisions can
     be exercised and redemptions made at specific prices for all preferred
     stock issues.  Redemptions require payment of accrued and unpaid dividends
     to the date fixed for redemption.

               In March 1992, Hackensack issued $15 million of 7-3/8% cumulative
     preferred stock, with a $2.1 million annual sinking fund requirement
     beginning in 2001, for redemption of first mortgage bonds and to provide
     funds for its ongoing capital programs.  Optional redemption of this new
     series begins in 1997.

               Cumulative preferred stock has been redeemed as follows:

</TABLE>

               These options are currently exercisable and represent the only
     stock options outstanding at December 31, 1993.  A total of 1,140,625
     shares are reserved for issuance under the plan.

               In May 1993, the shareholders approved the creation of dividend
     units to be issued in conjunction with stock options granted under the
     plan.  One dividend unit may be attached to an unexercised option to
     purchase a share of common stock.  This will entitle the option holder to
     accrue the aggregate dividends actually payable on one share of common
     stock while the dividend unit is in effect.  The dividend units are
     designed to create an incentive for option holders tied to the dividend
     payments on the common stock.  United Water recorded $47,000 in 1993 of
     compensation expense with respect to this plan.

               In May 1988, the shareholders approved a Restricted Stock Plan
     for key employees.  United Water issued 7,500 shares in 1993; 16,353 shares
     in 1992; and 12,661 shares in 1991 in connection with the plan and such
     shares are earned by the recipients over a 5-year period.  United Water
     recorded $301,000 in 1993, $241,000 in 1992 and $265,000 in 1991 of
     compensation expense with respect to this plan.

     NOTE 7 - SHAREHOLDER RIGHTS PLAN:

               In July 1989, the board of directors of United Water approved a
     Shareholder Rights Plan designed to protect shareholders against unfair and
     unequal treatment in the event of a proposed takeover. It also guards
     against partial tender offers and other hostile tactics to gain control of
     United Water without paying all shareholders a fair price.  Under the plan,
     each share of United Water's common stock also represents one Series A
     Participating Preferred Stock Purchase Right (Right) until the Rights
     become exercisable.  The Rights attach to all of United Water's common
     stock outstanding as of August 1, 1989, or subsequently issued, and expire
     on August 1, 1999.

               The Rights would be exercisable only if a person or group
     acquired 20% or more of United Water's common stock or announced a tender
     offer that would lead to ownership by a person or group of 20% or more of
     the common stock.

               In certain cases where an acquirer purchased more than 20% of
     United Water's common stock, the Rights would allow shareholders (other
     than the acquirer) to purchase shares of United Water's common stock at 50%
     of market price, diminishing the value of the acquirer's shares and
     diluting the acquirer's equity position in United Water.  If United Water
     were acquired in a merger or other business combination transaction, under
     certain circumstances the Rights could be used to purchase shares in the
     acquirer at 50% of the market price.  Subject to certain conditions, if a
     person or group acquired 20% or more of United Water's common stock, United
     Water's board of directors may exchange each Right held by shareholders
     (other than the acquirer) for one share of common stock or 1/100 of a share
     of Series A Participating Preferred Stock.  If an acquirer successfully
     purchased 80% of United Water's common stock after tendering for all of the
     stock, the Rights would not operate.  If holders of a majority of the
     shares of United Water's common stock approved a proposed acquisition under
     specified circumstances, the Rights would be redeemed at one cent each.
     They could also be redeemed by United Water's board of directors for one
     cent each at any time prior to the acquisition of 20% of the common stock
     by an acquirer.

               On September 15, 1993, United Water's Shareholder Rights Plan was
     amended in connection with United Water's execution of a merger agreement
     with GWC Corporation.  The amendment generally excepts the majority
     stockholder of GWC Corporation and its affiliates and associates from
     triggering the Rights through the execution of the merger agreement, the
     performance of the transactions contemplated therein or otherwise.

     NOTE 8 - EMPLOYEE BENEFITS:

     POSTRETIREMENT BENEFIT PLANS OTHER THAN PENSIONS:

               In January 1993, the company adopted SFAS No. 106, "Employers'
     Accounting for Postretirement Benefits Other Than Pensions."  This new
     standard requires that employers recognize these benefits on an accrual
     basis rather than on a cash basis.

               The company sponsors one non-contributory defined benefit
     postretirement plan that covers hospitalization, major medical benefits,
     and life insurance benefits for salaried and non-salaried employees.  The
     company is funding its postretirement health care benefits through
     contributions to Voluntary Employees' Beneficiary Association (VEBA)
     Trusts.

               The following sets forth the plans' funded status reconciled with
     the amounts recognized in the company's balance sheet as of December 31,
     1993:

     December 31, 1993 includes the following components:

                                                  ====== 
</TABLE>

               The assumed discount rate is 7.75% and the expected rate of
     return on plan assets is 8.25%, except for Hackensack's non-bargaining
     plan, which has an expected after-tax yield on assets of 5%.  The
     associated health care cost trend rate used in measuring the postretirement
     benefit obligation at December 31, 1993 was 14.2%, gradually declining to
     5.5% in 2002 and thereafter.  Increasing the assumed health care cost trend
     rate by one percentage point in each year will increase the APBO as of
     December 31, 1993 by $3.9 million to a total of $38.9 million and the
     aggregate service and interest cost components of net periodic
     postretirement benefit cost for 1993 by $896,000 to a total of $5.5
     million.  Hackensack and Spring Valley have been advised by the BRC and
     PSC, respectively, that they are allowed to defer postretirement health
     care costs in excess of those currently included in rates.  At December 31,
     1993, $3.4 million was deferred for recovery in future rates.  Most of the
     company's postretirement costs relate to employees and retirees of
     Hackensack and Spring Valley.  Therefore, adoption of SFAS No. 106 has not
     had a material effect on consolidated net income.

     DEFINED BENEFIT PENSION PLAN:

               Most employees are covered by trusteed non-contributory defined
     benefit pension plans under which benefits are based upon years of service
     and the employee's compensation during the last five
<PAGE>
 
                          United Water Resources Inc.

     years of employment.  United Water's policy is to fund amounts accrued for
     pension expense to the extent deductible for federal income tax purposes.
     It is expected that no funding will be made for 1993.

               Net periodic pension cost includes the following components at

     NOTE 9 - RATE MATTERS:
     SPRING VALLEY:

               In 1990 and 1989, Spring Valley deferred revenues totaling
     $505,000 and $1.2 million, respectively, related to reductions in pension
     expense and federal income tax rates pursuant to a PSC order.  As a result
     of the September 1990 rate application settlement with the PSC, Spring
     Valley began to refund these revenues to customers.  In February 1993,
     Spring Valley implemented a September 1992 PSC decision which revised its
     tariff design and discontinued the application of federal income tax
     revenue credits on customer bills.  Spring Valley is using unamortized
     revenue deferrals to recover the cost of a customer conservation program
     which began in the second quarter of 1993 and is anticipated to conclude in
     1995.

               In July 1992, Spring Valley applied to the PSC for permission to
     increase its annual revenues by $5 million, or 14.4%, to offset the effects
     of continued investment in plant facilities and increases in operating
     expenses.  On May 12, 1993, the PSC rendered its decision.  The PSC Opinion
     No. 93-9 allowed Spring Valley an overall rate of return of 8.75% and a
     return on equity of 10.5%.  The opinion provided for an increase in annual
     revenues of approximately $1.9 million, or 5.7%, which became effective on
     May 30, 1993.  The PSC also allowed Spring Valley to recover approximately
     $850,000 of previously deferred expenses and required it to refund certain
     revenue credits of approximately $1 million immediately.  This action,
     which resulted in a one-time increase in revenues and various expenses in
     the second quarter of 1993, did not have a material effect on net income.
     The PSC's decision also permitted Spring Valley to submit a second stage
     filing after February 1, 1994 to recover increases in property taxes,
     salaries and wages, and medical benefits that were not provided for in
     their previous determination.  In addition, in its second stage filing,
     Spring Valley will seek rate recognition of its other postretirement
     benefits.  In February 1994, Spring Valley filed a request to increase
     revenues by
<PAGE>
 
                          United Water Resources Inc.

     approximately $1.6 million, or 4.4%.  Spring Valley anticipates a PSC
     decision on its request in April 1994.

               The PSC's May 1993 decision also directed Spring Valley to
     institute a Revenue Reconciliation Clause (RRC), which requires Spring
     Valley to reconcile billed revenues with the pro forma revenues that were
     used to set rates.  Any variances outside a 1% range are accrued or
     deferred for subsequent recovery from or refund to customers.  As a result
     of the hot weather experienced during the summer of 1993, the RRC resulted
     in the deferral of $1.4 million, which will be used to recover certain
     deferred costs.  The remaining balance will be refunded to Spring Valley
     customers along with previous RRC credit balances over a three-year period
     beginning in July 1994.

               In 1990, the PSC modified its earlier decision regarding the 1985
     transfer of 23 acres of land from Spring Valley to Rivervale.  They ordered
     Spring Valley to record a deferred credit that reduced rate base by $1.9
     million.  In 1991, Spring Valley filed an appeal with the New York State
     Supreme Court-Appellate Division. In February 1992, a decision was rendered
     on the appeal affirming the PSC order.  The effect of that decision on
     United Water has been recognized by an after-tax charge against income of
     $809,000 in 1991.  Spring Valley has submitted a proposal to the PSC to
     make a one-time customer refund through bill credits of a portion of the
     deferred credit.  Spring Valley anticipates a PSC decision on its request
     in April 1994.

     HACKENSACK WATER:

               Based upon decisions rendered by the New Jersey Watershed
     Property Review Board on July 6, 1993, and the BRC on August 5, 1993,
     several lawsuits were settled between Hackensack and two environmental
     groups related to the land transfers that occurred in 1984 and 1990.

               The settlement upheld the 1990 transfer from Hackensack to
     Rivervale of approximately 290 acres of land that are unconditionally and
     permanently deed restricted to golf course and country club
<PAGE>
 
                          United Water Resources Inc.

     uses.  The settlement also required Hackensack to reacquire 355 acres of
     land which were transferred to Rivervale in 1984.  This acreage was added
     to Hackensack's reservoir protective holdings and rate base.

               The transfer price of the acreage being returned to Hackensack's
     plant accounts was valued at $26 million, reflecting development approvals
     that occurred during the nine years that the land was held by Rivervale.
     Approximately $11 million (which includes interest) in proceeds from the
     1990 golf course transfer to Rivervale was deferred for refund to
     Hackensack customers.  To permanently reduce the rate impact of the
     reacquisition by Hackensack of the 355 acres, $4 million of the proceeds
     was applied against the utility plant accounts, resulting in a net increase
     in utility rate base of $22 million.  The remaining $7 million of the
     proceeds will be applied as credits on customer bills to completely offset
     the impact of the rate increase of approximately 3.1%, or $3.5 million,
     which became effective October 12, 1993, in recognition of the increment to
     Hackensack's rate base.  It is anticipated that the credits on customer
     bills will be made for approximately two years.  Due to regulatory
     treatment, the effects of the intercompany transaction were not eliminated
     in consolidation.

     NOTE 10 - INCOME TAXES:

     NEW ACCOUNTING STANDARD:

               In January 1993, the company implemented SFAS No. 109,
     "Accounting for Income Taxes."   SFAS No. 109 requires that United Water
     adjust its recorded deferred income tax balances to reflect an estimate of
     its future tax liability based on temporary differences between the
     financial and tax basis of assets and liabilities.  This adjustment
     includes deferred taxes for utility temporary differences not previously
     recognized.  It also includes the effect on the liability of changes in tax
     laws and rates.

               The tax effect of this requirement will be considered in the
     ratemaking process, resulting in the recognition of recoverable income
     taxes.  The adoption of SFAS No. 109 resulted in the recording of a
     deferred tax liability and recoverable income taxes of $20.2 million at
     January 1, 1993, which is reflected on the balance sheet, with no material
     effect on net income.  The recoverable income taxes represent the probable
     future increase in revenues that will be received through future ratemaking
     proceedings for the recovery of these deferred taxes.

               The components of the total recoverable income taxes at December
     31, 1993 are as follows:

     INCOME TAX PROVISION:

            Federal income tax returns have been settled through 1988.  An
     appeal pertaining to a single issue from 1982 and 1985 was settled in
     August 1993 without a material effect on net income.  Federal income tax
     returns for 1989, 1990 and 1991 are currently under examination by the
     Internal Revenue Service.  Management believes that the outcome of this
     examination will not have a material effect upon the financial position of
     United Water.

     income tax rate to the actual income tax expense for the years ended
     December 31, is as follows:

     obtaining a market valuation of each issue, taking into account current
     interest rates at December 31, 1993 and 1992, and redemption premiums and
     dates, where applicable.

             The carrying amount of cash and short-term investments approximates
     the fair value, due to the short maturity of those instruments.

               The information called for by Items 10 (including information
     relating to delinquent filers under Section 16 of the Securities Exchange
     Act of 1934), 11, 12 and 13 is omitted because the registrant will file
     with the Securities and Exchange Commission, not later than 120 days after
     the close of the year covered by this Form 10-K, a definitive proxy
     statement pursuant to Regulation 14A involving the election of directors.

               In determining which persons may be affiliates of the registrant
     for the purpose of disclosing on the cover page of this Annual Report the
     market value of voting shares held by non-affiliates, the registrant has
     treated only the members of its Board of Directors as affiliates and has
     excluded from the calculation all shares beneficially owned by them.  No
     determination has been made that any director or person connected with a
     director is an affiliate or that any other person is not an affiliate.  The
     registrant specifically disclaims any intent to characterize any person as
     being or not being an affiliate.

                                   ARTICLE I
                                    OFFICES

     The registered office of the Corporation, which shall be its principal
office, shall be established and maintained at 200 Old Hook Road, in the Borough
of Harrington Park, County of Bergen, in the State of New Jersey.

                                   ARTICLE II
                                  STOCKHOLDERS

     Section 1.  Annual Meetings.  The annual meeting of the stockholders of the
Corporation for the election of directors and the transaction of such other
business as may properly come before the meeting shall be held at nine-thirty
o'clock in the forenoon of the second Monday of May in each year, or as soon
thereafter as convenient in the judgement of the Board of Directors.

     Section 2.  Special Meetings.  Special meetings of the stockholders may be
called at any time by the Chairman of the Board, the President or a majority of
the members of the Board of Directors.

     Section 3.  Place of Meetings.  All meetings of the stockholders may be
held at the principal office of the Corporation

                                       
<PAGE>
 
or at such other place within or without the State of New Jersey as may be
designated by the Board of Directors.

     Section 4.  Notice of Meetings.  Written notice stating the date, time,
place of the meeting and the purpose thereof, shall be given by mail not less
than ten nor more than sixty days before the date of the meeting to each
stockholder of record entitled to vote at the meeting.  Notice of any adjourned
meeting shall not be required to be given unless a new record date shall have
been fixed.

     Section 5.  Closing of Transfer Books or Fixing of Record Date.  For the
purpose of determining stockholders entitled to notice of or to vote at any
meeting of stockholders or any adjournment thereof, or stockholders entitled to
receive payment of any dividend, or in order to make a determination of
stockholders for any other proper purpose, the Board of Directors may provide
that the stock transfer books shall be closed for a stated period not to exceed,
in any case, sixty days.  If the stock transfer books shall be closed for the
purpose of determining stockholders entitled to notice of or to vote at a
meeting of stockholders, such books shall be closed for at least ten days
immediately preceding such meeting.  In lieu of closing the stock transfer
books, the Board of Directors may fix in advance a date as the record date for
any determination of stockholders, such date in any case to be not more than
sixty days and, in case of a meeting of stockholders, not

<PAGE>
 
less than ten days prior to the date on which the particular action, requiring
such determination of stockholders, is to be taken.  If the stock transfer books
are not closed and no record date is fixed for the determination of stockholders
entitled to notice of or to vote at a meeting of stockholders, or stockholders
entitled to receive payment of a dividend, or stockholders for any other proper
purpose, the day next preceding the date on which notice of the meeting is
mailed or the date on which the resolution of the Board of Directors declaring
such dividend or authorizing the other action for the purpose of which
stockholders are determined is adopted, as the case may be, shall be the record
date for such determination of stockholders.  In such case, such stockholders
and only such stockholders shall be stockholders of record on the date so
established and shall be entitled to such notice of, or to vote at, such
meeting, or to receive payment of such dividend or shall be the stockholders in
respect of whom such other action is to be taken, as the case may be,
notwithstanding any transfer of any stock on the books of the Corporation after
any such record date fixed as aforesaid.  When a determination of stockholders
entitled to vote at any meeting of stockholders has been made as provided
herein, such determination shall apply to any adjournment thereof.

     Section 6.  Quorum.  A majority of the outstanding shares of the
Corporation entitled to vote, represented in person or by proxy, shall
constitute a quorum at a meeting of stockholders.  If

<PAGE>
 
less than a majority of the outstanding shares is represented at a meeting, a
majority of the shares so represented may adjourn the meeting from time to time
without further notice except as provided in Section 4 of this Article II.  At
any such adjourned meeting at which a quorum shall be present or represented,
any business may be transacted which might have been transacted at the meeting
as originally noticed.  The stockholders present at a duly organized meeting may
continue to transact business until adjournment, notwithstanding the withdrawal
of enough stockholders to leave less than a quorum.

     Section 7.  Proxies.  At all meetings of stockholders, a stockholder may
vote in person or by proxy executed in writing by the stockholder or by his duly
authorized agent, except that a proxy may be given by a stockholder or his agent
by telegram or cable or its equivalent.  Such proxy shall be filed with the
Secretary of the Corporation before or at the time of the meeting.  No proxy
shall be valid after eleven months unless a longer time is provided therein, but
no proxy shall be valid after three years from the date of its execution.

     Section 8.  Voting.  At each meeting of the stockholders, each holder of
record of common stock of the Corporation, the holders of which are entitled to
vote, shall be entitled to one vote for each share of such common stock
registered in his name on the books of the Corporation at the time of such
meeting, except as provided to

<PAGE>
 
the contrary by law and except where, pursuant to Section 5 of this Article II,
a date shall have been established as a record date for the determination of the
stockholders entitled to vote.  Each holder of record of preferred stock of the
Corporation shall have such rights as to voting as may be set forth in or
established pursuant to the Restated Certificate of Incorporation of the
Corporation.

                                  ARTICLE III
                               BOARD OF DIRECTORS

     Section 1.  General Powers.  The business and affairs of the Corporation
shall be managed by the Board of Directors.

     Section 2.  Number, Term of Office and Qualifications.  The Board of
Directors shall be divided into three classes, as nearly equal in number as
possible and known as Classes I, II and III.  The total number of directors
shall be determined by resolution of the Board of Directors within the limits
fixed by the Restated Certificate of Incorporation but shall not be less than 3.
Each director (whether elected at an annual meeting or elected to fill a vacancy
or otherwise) shall hold office until his or her successor shall have been
elected, or until his or her death or until he or she shall resign in the manner
provided in Section 8 of this Article III or shall have been removed in
accordance with the provisions of the Restated Certificate of Incorporation.  No
person shall stand for election or re-election as a director if he or she

<PAGE>
 
has attained the age of sixty-eight at the time of an annual meeting of
stockholders which is to consider the election of directors.  Notwithstanding
the provisions of the preceding sentence, in the event that one (but not more
than one) person specified in Section 2.3 of the Amended and Restated Agreement
and Plan of Merger, dated as of September 15, 1993, between the Corporation and
GWC Corporation, shall have attained the age of sixty-eight at the time of the
1994 annual meeting of the stockholders of the Corporation, such person may at
said meeting stand for election or re-election as a director for one term (not
in excess of three years).  In case of any increase in the authorized number of
directors, additional directors to fill the vacancies in the Board of Directors
caused by such increase shall be elected at any meeting of the Board of
Directors by resolution passed by a majority of the entire Board.  Each director
shall be a bona fide holder of one or more shares of stock of the Corporation.

     Section 3.  Election of Directors.  At each meeting of the stockholders for
the election of directors, the directors to be elected shall be chosen by a
plurality of the votes cast at such meeting by the stockholders entitled to vote
for the director or directors in question.

     Section 4.  Annual and Regular Meetings.  Immediately after the annual
meeting of the stockholders, the annual meeting of the

<PAGE>
 
Board of Directors shall be held at the same place as the annual meeting of
stockholders, and notice of such meeting of the Board of Directors shall not be
required to be given.  The Board of Directors from time to time may provide for
the holding of regular meetings and fix the time and place (which may be within
or without the State of New Jersey) thereof.  Notice of regular meetings shall
not be required to be given.

     Section 5.  Special Meetings; Notice.  Special meetings of the Board of
Directors shall be held whenever called by the Chairman of the Board or by the
President at such time and place (which may be within or without the State of
New Jersey) as may be specified in the respective notices or waivers of notice
thereof.  Notice of each special meeting shall be given to each director on
three days' notice if by mail and on one day's notice if by telegram or
telephone, in all cases directed to his residence or usual place of business.
Notice of any special meeting shall not be required to be given to any director
who shall attend such meeting in person, or to any director who shall waive
notice of such meeting in writing or by telegram, whether before or after the
time of such meeting; and any such meeting shall be a legal meeting without any
notice thereof having been given if all the directors shall be present thereat.

     Section 6.  Adjourned Meetings.  Notice of an adjourned meeting of the
Board of Directors shall be given in accordance with

<PAGE>
 
Section 5 of this Article III to all directors absent from the meeting
adjourning (provided, however, that if the period of adjournment exceeds ten
days, such notice shall be given to all directors), subject to the provisions of
the last sentence of said Section 5.

     Section 7.  Quorum and Manner of Acting.  At all meetings of the Board of
Directors a majority of the entire Board of Directors of the Corporation shall
be necessary and sufficient to constitute a quorum for the transaction of
business (except as otherwise specified in the Corporation's Restated
Certificate of Incorporation, its By-Laws or by statute).  Except as otherwise
required by statute and by Section 2 of Article IV hereof, the act of a majority
of a quorum shall be the act of the Board of Directors.  In the absence of a
quorum, a majority of the directors present may adjourn the meeting from time to
time until a quorum shall be present.  In addition:

        (a)  any or all of the directors of the Corporation may participate in a
     meeting of the Board of Directors by means of conference telephone or any
     other means of communication by which all persons participating in the
     meeting are able to hear each other; and

        (b)  any action required or permitted to be taken by the Board of
     Directors at a meeting may be taken without a meeting if, prior or
     subsequent to such action, all members of the Board of Directors consent
     thereto in a writing filed with the

<PAGE>
 
     minutes of proceedings of the Board of Directors.

     Section 8.  Resignations.  Any director may resign at any time by giving
written notice of such resignation to the Board of Directors, to the Chairman of
the Board or to the President of the Corporation.  Unless otherwise specified in
such written notice, such resignation shall take effect upon receipt thereof by
the Board of Directors or any such officer.

     Section 9.  Compensation.  Pursuant to resolutions adopted from time to
time by the Board of Directors, the directors may be paid an annual retainer for
services rendered as directors and/or as members of any committee of the Board
of Directors in such amount as may be determined by the Board.  In addition, by
resolution of the Board of Directors, the Directors may be allowed a fixed sum
and travelling expenses for attendance at each regular or special meeting of the
Board and/or any such committee; provided, however, that directors who are
employees of the Corporation or of any subsidiary of the Corporation shall not
be entitled to compensation in connection with services rendered as directors or
as members of any committee of the Board of Directors.

     Section 10.  Indemnification of Directors and Officers.  Each of the
officers and directors of the Corporation, in the event of an action commenced
against him by reason of the fact that he is or was an officer or director of
the Corporation (or is or was serving

<PAGE>
 
in any capacity at the request of the Corporation in some other corporation,
organization or enterprise) shall be entitled to indemnification from the
Corporation to the full extent permitted by the laws of the State of New Jersey.
Such indemnification shall include, but not be limited to, the following:

        (a)  In the case of an action by or in the right of the Corporation, he
     shall be entitled to indemnification against the reasonable expenses,
     including attorney's fees, actually and necessarily incurred by him in
     connection with the defense of such an action or any appeal therein,
     provided, however, that no such indemnification shall lie where he is
     adjudged to be liable for negligence or misconduct unless and only to the
     extent that the Superior Court or the court in which such proceeding was
     brought shall determine, upon application, that despite the adjudication of
     liability he is fairly and reasonably entitled to indemnification for such
     expenses in light of all the circumstances of the case.

        (b)  In the case of an action other than by or in the right of the
     Corporation, he shall be entitled to indemnification against judgments,
     fines, amounts paid in settlement, penalties and reasonable expenses,
     including attorney's fees, actually and necessarily incurred by him as a
     result of such action, or any appeal therein, if he acted in good faith and
     in a manner he reasonably believed to be in, or not opposed to, the best
     interests of the Corporation and, in the case of a criminal action, in
     addition, he had no reasonable cause to

<PAGE>
 
     believe that his conduct was unlawful.

     The Board of Directors shall determine, by act of a majority of a quorum of
directors who are not parties to the action in question, whether the requisite
standard of conduct has been met by the person or persons concerned.  In the
event such a quorum is not available, the Board of Directors shall make such a
determination upon the written opinion of independent legal counsel that
indemnification is proper in the circumstances because the applicable standard
of conduct has been met by the person or persons concerned.

     Expenses incurred in defending a proceeding may be paid by the Corporation
in advance of the final disposition of such proceeding, if authorized in the
manner provided by the laws of the State of New Jersey, upon receipt of an
undertaking by or on behalf of the officer or director to repay such amount
unless it shall ultimately be determined that he is entitled to be indemnified
as provided by law.

     Section 11.  Reliance on Experts by Directors and Officers.  In addition to
any rights or duties prescribed by statute, each director and officer of the
Corporation shall perform his duties as such in good faith, in a manner he
reasonably believes to be in the best interests of the Corporation, and with
such care as an ordinarily prudent person in the like position would use under
similar circumstances.  In performing his duties, each director and officer
shall be entitled to rely on the opinion of counsel for the

<PAGE>
 
Corporation or upon written reports setting forth financial data concerning the
Corporation and prepared by an independent or certified public accountant or a
firm of such accountants or upon financial statements, books of account or
reports of the Corporation represented to him to be correct by the President,
the officer of the Corporation having charge of its books of account or the
person presiding at a meeting of the Board of Directors or at a meeting of any
committee of the Board designated pursuant to Section 1 of Article IV hereof.  A
person who so performs his duties shall have no liability by reason of being or
having been a director or officer of the Corporation.

          Section 12.  Presumption of Assent.  A director of the Corporation who
is present at a meeting of the Board of Directors, or any committee thereof, at
which corporate action on any corporate matter is taken shall be presumed to
have assented to the action taken unless his dissent shall be entered in the
minutes of the meeting or unless he shall file his written dissent to such
action with the person acting as secretary of the meeting before or promptly
after the adjournment thereof.  Such right of dissent shall not apply to a
director who voted in favor of such action.  A director who is absent from any
such meeting shall be presumed to have concurred in the action taken unless he
shall file his dissent with the Secretary of the Corporation within a reasonable
time after learning of such action.

                                   ARTICLE IV
                         EXECUTIVE AND OTHER COMMITTEES

          Section 1.  Appointment.  The Board of Directors, by resolution
adopted by a majority of the entire Board, shall designate, annually, from among
its members an Executive Committee and such other committees of the Board as may
be necessary or desirable.  In likewise, the Board of Directors shall designate,
annually, a Chairman of the Executive Committee and the Chairmen of any other
such committees.  The Board may at any time abolish or revise the Executive
Committee or any such committee, redesignate the Chairmen thereof, remove a
member thereof or fill a vacancy therein by resolution similarly adopted.

          Section 2.  Powers.  During the intervals between the meetings of the
Board of Directors, unless otherwise provided from time to time by resolution
passed by a majority of the entire Board, the Executive Committee shall have and
may exercise all powers of the Board of Directors in the management of the
business and affairs of the Corporation; provided, however, that neither the
Executive Committee nor any other committee of the Board shall have authority to
make, alter or repeal the By-Laws of the Corporation; declare or make payment of
a dividend of the Corporation; elect or remove any director or officer of the
Corporation; submit to the stockholders any action requiring stockholder
approval; or amend or repeal any resolution theretofore adopted by the Board of
Directors, which by

it by the Board of Directors.

          Section 3.  Meetings; Notices; Records.  The Executive Committee and
all other committees of the Board may hold regular and special meetings at such
place or places (within or without the State of New Jersey) and at such time or
times as it shall determine from time to time.  Notice of regular meetings shall
not be required to be given; provided, however, that when the time or place of
regular meetings shall be fixed or changed, notice of such action shall be given
promptly to each member who shall not have been present at the meeting at which
such action was taken, addressed to him at his residence or usual place of
business.  Any member of the Executive Committee or of any other committee of
the Board may call a special meeting of such committee.  Notice of each special
meeting shall be given to each member on three days' notice if by mail or on one
day's notice if by telegram or telephone, in all cases directed to his residence
or usual place of business.  Notice of any special meeting need not be given to
any member who shall attend such meeting in person, or who shall waive notice
thereof in writing or by telegram, whether before or after the time of such
meeting; and any such meeting shall be a legal meeting without any notice
thereof having been given if all the members shall be present thereat.  No
notice of any adjourned meeting need be given.  The Executive Committee and all
other committees of the

<PAGE>
 
Board shall keep a record of their proceedings and shall report such proceedings
to the Board of Directors at the meeting thereof held next after the same have
been taken.

          Section 4.  Quorum and Manner of Acting.  At all meetings of the
Executive Committee and any other committee of the Board, members consisting of
a majority of the total authorized membership of such committee shall be
necessary and sufficient to constitute a quorum for the transaction of business,
and the act of a majority of a quorum shall be the act of the committee;
provided, however, that with respect to the Executive Committee and any other
committee of the Board:

          (a)  any or all of the members of the committee may participate in a
     meeting of the committee by means of a conference telephone or any other
     means of communication by which all persons participating in the meeting
     are able to hear each other; and

          (b)  any action required or permitted to be taken by the committee at
     a meeting may be taken without a meeting if, prior or subsequent to such
     action, all members of the committee consent thereto in a writing filed
     with the minutes of proceedings of the committee.

          Section 5.  Resignations.  Any member of the Executive Committee or of
any other committee of the Board may resign at any time by giving written notice
of such resignation to either the

<PAGE>
 
Board of Directors, the Chairman of the Board or the President of the
Corporation. Unless otherwise specified in such written notice, such 
resignation shall take effect upon its receipt.

offices and to elect such persons to fill such offices as may be necessary or
appropriate.  Each such officer shall hold office until his successor shall have
been duly elected and shall have qualified or until his earlier death,
resignation or removal.  The Chairman of the Board and the President shall be
and remain directors of the Corporation during their terms in office.  Any two
or more offices may be held by the same person, but no officer shall execute any
document in more than one capacity if required to be executed by two or more
officers.

the Board of Directors, and shall see that all orders and resolutions of the
Board of Directors and of the Executive Committee are carried into effect.  He
shall perform such other duties as are given to him by these By-Laws or as from
time to time may be assigned to him by the Board of Directors.

          Section 8.  The Secretary.  The Secretary shall, in general, perform
all duties incident to the office of Secretary and such other duties as from
time to time may be assigned to him by the Board of Directors or the President.

          Section 9.  The Treasurer.  The Treasurer shall, in general, perform

          Section 1.   Execution of Instruments.  The Board of Directors may

that the Corporation is organized under the laws of the State of New Jersey.
The signatures of such officers upon a certificate may be facsimiles if the

other than the Corporation itself or one of its employees.  Each certificate for

address of the person to whom the shares represented thereby are issued, with
the number of shares, class, series, if any, and date of issue, shall be entered

All certificates surrendered to the Corporation for transfer shall be cancelled
and no new certificate shall be issued until the former certificate for a like
number of shares shall have been surrendered and cancelled, except that in case
of a lost, stolen or destroyed certificate a new one may be issued therefor upon
such terms and indemnity to the Corporation as the Board of Directors may
prescribe.

          Section 2.  Transfer of Stock.  Transfers of shares of the stock of
the Corporation shall be made only on the books of the Corporation by the holder

evidence of authority to transfer, or by his attorney thereunto authorized by
power of

<PAGE>
 
attorney duly executed and filed with the Secretary of the Corporation, and on
surrender for cancellation of the certificate for such shares.  The person in
whose name shares stand on the books of the Corporation shall be deemed by the
Corporation to be the owner thereof for all purposes.

          Section 3.  Lost, Stolen or Destroyed Certificates.  The Board of
Directors may determine the conditions upon which a new certificate of stock
will be issued in place of a certificate which is alleged to have been lost,
stolen or destroyed, and may, in its discretion, require the owner of such
certificate or his legal representative to give bond, with sufficient surety to
the Corporation to indemnify it against any and all losses or claims which arise
by reason of the issue of a new certificate in the place of the one so lost,
stolen or destroyed.

                                  ARTICLE VIII

                       NEW  INDEMNIFICATION  UNDERTAKING
                       ---------------------------------



               Pursuant to Item 512(h) of Regulation S-K, the following
     undertaking is hereby incorporated into Part II (Item 9) of the
     Registrant's Registration Statement on Form S-8 No. 33-32672.  Insofar as
     indemnification for liabilities arising under the Securities Act of 1933
     may be permitted to directors, officers, and controlling persons of the
     Registrant pursuant to the foregoing provisions, or otherwise, the
     Registrant has been advised that in the opinion of the Securities and
     Exchange Commission such indemnification is against public policy as
     expressed in the Act and is, therefore, unenforceable.  In the event that a
     claim for indemnification against such liabilities (other than the payment
     by the Registrant of expenses incurred or paid by a director, officer, or
     controlling person of the Registrant in the successful defense of any
     action, suit, or proceeding) is asserted by such director, officer, or
     controlling person in connection with the securities being registered, the
     Registrant will, unless in the opinion of its counsel the matter has been
     settled by controlling precedent, submit to a court of appropriate
     jurisdiction the question whether such indemnification by it is against
     public policy as expressed in the Act and will be governed by the final
     adjudication of such issue.
