ITEM 1.  BUSINESS
- -------  --------

(a)  GENERAL DEVELOPMENT OF BUSINESS
     -------------------------------

     United Water Resources Inc. (United Water, or the Company) is a New Jersey
corporation that was incorporated on February 25, 1983 and has its principal
office at 200 Old Hook Road, Harrington Park, New Jersey 07640.  On April 22,
1994, United Water completed a merger (the Merger) with GWC Corporation (GWC),
in which United Water was the surviving corporation.  GWC's  principal assets
included 100% of the stock of General Waterworks Corporation, which owns
regulated water and wastewater utilities operating in 14 states, and a 25%
indirect investment in JMM Operational Services, Inc. (JMM).  JMM provides
operations and management services to government and industry for water and
wastewater treatment facilities.  The Merger was accounted for under the
purchase method of accounting.  For a discussion of the Merger, see Item 1 (c),
below.

     In March 1995, the Company changed the names of many of its operating
subsidiaries.  By adopting "United Water" in the names of its utility
subsidiaries, the Company will achieve a unified corporate identity and greater
national recognition.  The new names of some of the larger operating
subsidiaries are United Water New Jersey (formerly Hackensack Water Company),
United Waterworks (formerly General Waterworks Corporation) and United Water New
York (formerly Spring Valley Water Company).  In 1994, Rivervale Realty Company
changed its name to United Properties Group.   The new names are used hereafter.

     United Water's principal utility subsidiaries, United Water New Jersey,
United Water New York and United Waterworks, provide water and wastewater
services to approximately two million people in fourteen states, with more than
half of the Company's utility operations located in northeastern New Jersey and
southeastern New York.  United Water New Jersey was incorporated by an act of
the New 

                                                                               1

Jersey Legislature in 1869. United Water New York was incorporated under the
laws of New York in 1893 and is wholly-owned by United Water New Jersey. United
Waterworks was incorporated under the laws of Delaware in 1942. Other
significant wholly-owned subsidiaries of United Water include: United Properties
Group (United Properties), which is engaged in real estate activities, including
commercial rentals, land development, golf course operations and consulting
services; Laboratory Resources, a network of environmental testing laboratories
in New Jersey, Connecticut and Pennsylvania; and United Water Mid-Atlantic
(formerly Mid-Atlantic Utilities Corporation), which owns and operates water and
wastewater systems.

(b)  FINANCIAL INFORMATION ABOUT INDUSTRY SEGMENTS
     ---------------------------------------------
     See Note 15 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 below for
segment information.



(b)  NARRATIVE DESCRIPTION OF BUSINESS
     ---------------------------------
     As a holding company, United Water does not conduct any business
operations, except through its subsidiaries.

MERGER WITH GWC CORPORATION
- ---------------------------

     On April 22, 1994, United Water completed a Merger with GWC, in which
United Water was the surviving corporation.  GWC's principal assets included
100% of the stock of General Waterworks Corporation (now known as United
Waterworks). The Merger was accounted for under the purchase method and resulted
in the recording of a utility plant acquisition adjustment of $67 million.  In
exchange for the common stock of GWC that was issued and outstanding immediately
preceding the Merger, United Water (i) issued 9,295,860 shares of United Water
common stock, (ii) issued 3,341,078 shares of United Water 5% cumulative
convertible preference stock, with a liquidation price of $13.794 per share, and
(iii) 

                                                                               2

                          United Water Resources Inc.

paid former shareholders of GWC $8.9 million in cash.  In addition, each
share of GWC 7 5/8% cumulative preferred stock outstanding at the time of the
Merger was converted into one fully paid non-assessable share of United Water
7 5/8% cumulative preferred stock, with equal stated dividends and substantially
similar rights, privileges, qualifications and restrictions.

     Prior to the Merger, Lyonnaise American Holding, Inc. (LAH), a Delaware
corporation and a wholly-owned subsidiary of Lyonnaise des Eaux, a French
societe anonyme, owned approximately 81.9% of GWC's common stock.  The remaining
18.1% of GWC's common stock was publicly traded.  On the date of the Merger, LAH
converted 70% of its shares of GWC common stock into United Water common stock
and the remainder of its shares of GWC common stock into United Water 5%
cumulative convertible preference stock.  Immediately after the Merger, LAH
owned approximately 25.4% of the issued and outstanding United Water common
stock and approximately 97.7% of the issued and outstanding United Water 5%
cumulative convertible preference stock.  A twelve-year Governance Agreement, 
commencing April 22, 1994, between LAH and United Water contains a number of 
restrictions, including restrictions on when LAH can convert its preference
shares into United Water common stock and on LAH's ability to buy or sell United
Water common stock or preference stock.

REGULATED UTILITY OPERATIONS
- ----------------------------

     The Company's principal business is providing water and wastewater services
to the public at large in areas where its regulated utility subsidiaries possess
franchises to provide such services.  Its utility subsidiaries are subject to
rate regulation, generally by the regulatory authorities in the states in which
they operate.

                                                                               3

                          United Water Resources Inc.

     United Water New Jersey supplies water service to approximately 175,600
customers in 60 municipalities in the northeastern part of New Jersey, serving
most of Bergen County and the northern part of Hudson County.  The total
population served is about 750,000 persons.  United Water New Jersey is subject
to rate regulation by the New Jersey Board of Public Utilities (BPU).  United
Water New Jersey's principal source of water supply is the Hackensack River,
with a watershed of 113 square miles, and is supplemented  by water diversions
from additional streams and rivers, by ground water supplies drawn from wells
and by the purchase of water from contiguous water systems.  United Water New
Jersey also obtains stream flow benefits from United Water New York, which owns
and operates an impounding reservoir, Lake DeForest, on the Hackensack River in
Rockland County, New York, and has available additional water supply from the
Wanaque South Project.  The Wanaque South Project, which was completed in 1987,
is a joint undertaking of United Water New Jersey and the North Jersey District
Water Supply Commission.  United Water New Jersey has a 50% interest in the
utility plant of the Wanaque South Project and is responsible for its
proportionate share of operating expenses.

     United Water New York supplies water service to approximately 61,200
customers in Rockland County, New York, and is subject to rate regulation by the
New York Public Service Commission (PSC).  The total population served is about
250,000 persons.  United Water New York's principal source of supply is derived
from wells and surface supplies, including the Lake DeForest reservoir.

     United Waterworks is a holding company that provides water and wastewater
services to a total of approximately 346,000 customers in 14 states through its
regulated water and wastewater utility subsidiaries.  The utility subsidiaries
of United Waterworks serve a total population of about 1,000,000 persons.  Its
water utilities obtain water primarily from wells and surface supplies (lakes,
ponds, reservoirs and streams), and in a few cases purchase water wholesale from
adjoining water systems, generally owned  

                                                                               4

by municipalities. None of United Waterworks' major water utility subsidiaries
are dependent upon water purchased from others, except that United Water New
Rochelle (formerly The New Rochelle Water Company), a wholly-owned subsidiary,
purchases all of its water from an aqueduct system that is owned by and serves
the City of New York. United Waterworks believes that its water utilities have
adequate supplies of water for their present requirements, but anticipates
making future capital expenditures to expand their sources of water supply,
primarily through development of additional wells and expansion of other
facilities, to provide for projected increases in future demand because of
customer growth.

     United Water Mid-Atlantic owns and operates several small water and
wastewater utility systems that provide water supply, wastewater collection and
wastewater transmission services to approximately 3,700 customers in Vernon
Township and Mt. Arlington, New Jersey.  United Water Mid-Atlantic's
subsidiaries are subject to regulation by the BPU.

     The Company's water business is seasonal, as sales tend to be higher during
warm, dry periods.  The Company's water utilities operate in some jurisdictions
in which water conservation regulations have from time to time been imposed
during periods of drought.  To date, such regulations have not had a material
impact on the Company's results of operations.  The Company's  water utilities
have not experienced any long-term disruption of service because of
contamination of their water supplies; however, the Company cannot predict what
effect such events, should they occur, would have on its business.

                                                                               5

                          United Water Resources Inc.

     The following table sets forth information concerning United Water's water
and wastewater utility operations, particularly the nine larger utilities which
in 1994 accounted for 87.2% of United Water's utility customers, 92.5% of United
Water's utility revenues and 91.6% of United Water's net investment in utility
plant.

/(1)/  Acquired April 1994 in the Merger with GWC. Revenues include period from
       April 1 to December 31, 1994.

          The Company's water utility subsidiaries chemically and physically
treat, filter or otherwise improve the quality of the water.  Treated water is
distributed to customers through the utility subsidiaries' distribution mains,
assisted by pumping facilities where necessary.  The Company's utility
operations provide water that meets or surpasses the minimum standards of the
Federal Safe Drinking Water Act (SDWA) of 1974, as amended in 1986.

protection customers. Of the Company's 551,721 water utility customers at
December 31, 1994, 496,400 (90%) were residential customers, 51,981 (9%) were
commercial customers and 3,340 (1%) were industrial customers. The Company also
had 34,660 wastewater customers at December 31, 1994, many of whom were also
water customers of the Company. No single utility customer accounted for more
than 10% of the Company's utility revenues in 1994.

          Capital Expenditures.  As a result of the utility operations of United
          --------------------                                                  
Waterworks acquired in the Merger with GWC in April 1994, the Company's
additions to utility plant increased substantially in 1994, from $15,986,000 in
1993 to $57,592,000 in 1994.  For a discussion of the Company's capital
expenditures, see Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition
and Results of Operations in Item 7, below.

          Competition and Franchises.  Substantially all of the Company's
          --------------------------                                     
utility subsidiaries serve an area or areas in which the subsidiaries own and
operate the sole public water or wastewater system.  Accordingly, the Company's
utility businesses are, in most cases, free from direct competition.  The
Company believes that its utility subsidiaries possess, with relatively minor
exceptions and qualifications, such governmental franchises, water rights,
licenses and permits as are necessary for the continuation of the water and
wastewater operations as now conducted.  Many such franchises, rights, licenses
and permits are perpetual and others are expected to be renewable as they
expire.  The Company's utility subsidiaries derive their rights to install and
maintain distribution mains under streets and other public places from statutes,
municipal ordinances and permits from state and local authorities.  In most
cases, these rights are non-exclusive.

          Governmental Acquisition.  In most of the states in which the Company
          ------------------------                                             
has water or wastewater operations, there exists the right of governmental
acquisition.  The price to be paid under condemnation is usually determined in
accordance with the eminent domain statutes of the state governing

                                                                               7

                          United Water Resources Inc.

the taking of land or other property by condemnation, which statutes generally
provide for the payment of a price which reflects the fair value of the
condemned property. A condemnation action was commenced in 1994 against United
Waterworks' water and wastewater utility in New Mexico. See Item 3, Legal
Proceedings, below.

          Rate Matters.   The Company's utility subsidiaries are subject to
          ------------                                                     
regulation by state regulatory commissions (or, in one case, by a local
authority) having jurisdiction over their respective service areas with regard
to rates, services, safety, accounting, issuance of securities, changes in
ownership, control or organization and other matters.  The rates charged by the
Company's utility subsidiaries are fixed by the regulatory authority having
jurisdiction over each utility.  The profitability of the Company's utility
subsidiaries is to a large extent dependent upon the timeliness and adequacy of
the rate relief allowed by regulatory authorities.  Accordingly, the Company
maintains a centralized rate management staff which monitors expense increases,
capital expenditures and other factors affecting the financial performance of
its utility subsidiaries and prepares, files and litigates rate cases.  In
certain jurisdictions, procedures have been established by the utility
regulatory authorities to permit a more rapid, and less costly, recovery of
certain expense increases.  The Company believes that all of its regulated
utilities are in compliance with those regulations.  For a discussion of rate
increases granted the Company's utility subsidiaries in 1994 and 1993, see Note
10 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8, below.

NON-REGULATED OPERATIONS
- ------------------------

          The Company is engaged in several activities which are not subject to
regulation of rates, service and similar matters by state public utility
commissions.  The Company's principal non-regulated operations include United
Properties, a subsidiary engaged in real estate activities, Laboratory
Resources, a subsidiary that owns and operates a network of environmental
testing laboratories, and a 50% investment in a joint venture partnership (the
Partnership) with LAH which, in turn, holds 50% of the common stock of JMM, an
environmental technology and engineering firm.

          United Properties  United Properties is a non-regulated business
          -----------------                                               
engaged in real estate investment and development activities, including
commercial office and retail properties, residential and commercial  land
development, golf course operations and consulting services.  United Properties
owns a portfolio of real estate located in New Jersey, New York and
Pennsylvania.  United Properties also provides consulting and advisory services
in support of the real estate assets of the other United Water companies.

          JMM Operational Services, Inc.  As a result of the Merger and the
          ------------------------------                                   
formation of the Partnership with LAH, the Company acquired an indirect 25%
interest in  JMM.  The Partnership owns 50% of JMM's outstanding common stock
and the remaining 50% is owned by Montgomery Watson Americas, Inc., a privately
held environmental technology and engineering firm.  JMM, headquartered in
Denver, Colorado, provides contract operations and maintenance services,
principally to municipalities, for water and wastewater facilities in North
America.  JMM also offers its customers specialized operations and maintenance
consulting services that include facilities start up, staff training, plant
evaluation, operational problem solving, preparation of operating manuals and
maintenance management.  The Company's investment in the Partnership is
accounted for under the equity method of accounting.  The Partnership is also
actively seeking other opportunities to provide water and wastewater services to

                                                                               9

environmental analyses for consulting engineers, industry, public water
suppliers, wastewater treatment facilities and governmental agencies.  In 1994,
Laboratory Resources received U.S. Army and Navy environmental cleanup
certifications allowing them to enter into a new and growing market.
Negotiations for other federal contracts are in progress.

          Hoboken Service Contract   The Company entered into a public-private
          ------------------------                                            
partnership with the city of Hoboken, NJ in July 1994.  The Company will manage
and maintain the city's distribution system and the city will retain ownership.

EMPLOYEE RELATIONS
- ------------------

          The Company and its subsidiaries have approximately 1,400 employees.
Subsidiaries of the Company are parties to agreements with labor unions covering
approximately 535 employees at 9 locations.  The Company does not expect any
material interference with operations at any location as a result of the
expiration of any of these labor agreements.  During the past five years, the
Company has experienced no work stoppages.  The Company considers its employee
relations to be good.

ENVIRONMENTAL REGULATION
- ------------------------

          The Company and its subsidiaries are subject to environmental
regulation by state and federal agencies.  The state agencies typically consist
of one responsible for public health and another responsible for environmental
protection.  The United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) administers
numerous federal statutes which encompass both public health and environmental
protection concerns.

                                                                              10
<PAGE>
 
                          United Water Resources Inc.


          At the Federal level, the SDWA provides minimum standards for potable
water quality and monitoring.  State statutes and regulations, which are also
applicable, impose standards which, in some cases, are more stringent than the
Federal standards.  The Company believes that all its water utilities are
currently in compliance in all material respects with, and have all permits
required by, the SDWA and other applicable Federal and state health and
environmental statutes and regulations.

          During 1986, the EPA issued revisions and a timetable for future
revisions to its regulations which resulted in additional and more stringent
standards under the SDWA.  The Company does not expect any significant adverse
financial impact from these new regulations on the Company's results of
operations or financial condition.  Although the Company projects that
additional expenditures for utility plant will be required as a result of the
1986 amendments to the SDWA, as discussed above, it anticipates that regulatory
authorities will allow a recovery of and return on any investment needed.

          The Federal Water Pollution Control Act, also known as the Clean Water
Act, and state laws in a number of jurisdictions regulate certain effluent
discharges into waterways.  These laws are administered by the EPA at the
federal level and by state agencies.  These laws require the Company's utility
subsidiaries to obtain permits for effluent discharges associated with water and
wastewater treatment operations and these permits typically impose limitations
with respect to quality and quantity of effluent discharges.  The Company
believes that its utility subsidiaries are currently in compliance in all
material respects with, and have all permits required by, these pollution
control statutes.

ITEM 2.        PROPERTIES
- -------        ----------

REGULATED UTILITY OPERATIONS
- ----------------------------

          United Water's utility subsidiaries own, operate and maintain a total
of 383 wells, 58 water treatment plants, with treatment capacities of up to 200
million gallons per day (MGD), 15 wastewater treatment plants, with treatment
capacities of up to 3 MGD, and 211 ground and elevated storage tanks.  The
Company's utility subsidiaries also own numerous impounding basins, lift
stations and purification stations, generally located on land owned by the
respective subsidiaries.  In addition, the Company's utility subsidiaries own a
total of approximately 7,472 miles of water transmission and distribution mains
and 440 miles of wastewater collection mains.  The water mains and wastewater
collection facilities are located in easements and rights-of-way on or under
public highways, streets, waterways and other public places pursuant to
statutes, municipal ordinances and permits from state and local authorities, or
on or under property owned by the respective subsidiaries or occupied under
property rights from the owners, which rights are deemed adequate for the
purpose for which they are used.  In addition, the Company's subsidiaries own
pipelines, meters, services, fire hydrants, transportation vehicles,
construction equipment, office furniture and equipment and computer equipment.
United Water's subsidiaries own or lease office space at their respective
locations.

          In connection with the Wanaque South Project, United Water New Jersey
owns a 17-mile aqueduct from the Wanaque Reservoir to the Oradell Reservoir,
along with a booster pumping station.  United Water New Jersey also owns 50% of
the other elements of the Wanaque South Project, including an 11-mile aqueduct
and related pump stations, a roller compacted concrete dam and reservoir, and
has contracted rights to yields derived from the Passaic and Ramapo rivers.

                                                                              12

NON-REGULATED OPERATIONS
- ------------------------

          United Properties owns approximately 1,500 acres of land available for
sale or under development principally in New Jersey, New York and Pennsylvania
and  487,250 square feet of office and retail properties.

          Laboratory Resources owns and operates three (3) commercial testing
laboratories in Teterboro, New Jersey; Brooklyn, Connecticut; and Bethlehem,
Pennsylvania.

ITEM 3.   LEGAL PROCEEDINGS
- -------   -----------------

          In 1990, the Paterson Municipal Utilities Authority (PMUA) filed suit
in the Superior Court of New Jersey - Passaic County, against United Water New
Jersey and the North Jersey District Water Supply Commission. The suit was based
on PMUA's alleged ownership of various water rights in the Passaic River, which
rights the PMUA claimed were, or may have been, affected by diversions related
to the Wanaque South Project, a project owned equally by United Water New Jersey
and the North Jersey District Water Supply Commission. United Water New Jersey's
Motion for Summary Judgement, dismissing the Complaint, was granted by the trial
court in July 1992. In October 1992 the PMUA filed a Notice of Appeal with the
Appellate Division, and the Appellate Division affirmed the dismissal in May
1994. The PMUA next appealed to the New Jersey Supreme Court, which denied
certification of this appeal in September 1994. Finally, the PMUA filed a
Petition for Certiorari to the United States Supreme Court in December 1994, and
in February 1995 the United States Supreme Court denied their petition.

          Two suits were filed by Safas Corporation and New Regime Company
against United Water, Dundee Water Power & Land Co. (Dundee) and United Water
New Jersey in September and November 1994 in the Superior Court of New Jersey -
Passaic County. The suits allege that the plaintiffs suffered property damages
as a result of an alleged breach in a berm surrounding the Dundee Canal,
allowing water to escape. The Dundee Canal is the property of Dundee, a
corporation of which United

                                                                              13

Water owns 50% of the outstanding common stock. While an assessment of the
property damages being alleged has not yet been completed, it is believed that
such claims will be in excess of $500,000. One of the plaintiffs has voluntarily
dismissed the Company and United Water New Jersey from its action, having been
provided satisfactory evidence by the Company regarding its status as a
shareholder in Dundee, and the Company intends to pursue a similar dismissal
with counsel for the other plaintiff. The Company is of the opinion that it,
United Water New Jersey and Dundee have adequate insurance to cover claims of
this nature. United Water is undertaking a continuing investigation of the
claims in conjunction with the North Jersey District Water Supply Commission,
the other 50% co-owner of Dundee.

          United Waterworks owns a utility subsidiary which provides water and
wastewater services to customers in Rio Rancho, New Mexico.  The city of Rio
Rancho (the City) notified United Waterworks that it intends to acquire the
Company's utility operations in Rio Rancho, and on October 28, 1994 commenced
condemnation proceedings in the Thirteenth Judicial District, Sandoval County.
On December 15, 1994, the City filed an Application for Immediate Possession of
the Company's utility system in Rio Rancho. Hearings were held on the
Application, and on March 2, 1995 the Company was notified by the Court that it
would grant the City its Application for Immediate Possession and that a hearing
would be held on March 22, 1995 so that the order could be entered. Upon entry
of the order, the City will have 90 days to tender to the court $53 million as a
deposit for the condemnation. The City cannot take immediate possession until
the deposit is made. New Mexico's condemnation laws require that the City pay
the Company fair market value for any assets that are taken by the City in a
condemnation proceeding. Consequently, the Company expects that the final, total
payment by the City for the assets taken by a condemnation, or sale in lieu of
condemnation, should result in the Company at least recovering the book value of
its Rio Rancho utility. In 1994, the Company's Rio Rancho utility had revenues
of $11.6 million.

                                                                              14

          United Water Delaware (formerly Wilmington Suburban Water
Corporation), a subsidiary of United Waterworks, is the subject of a Criminal
Violation Notice issued by the New Castle County, Delaware Department of Public
Works (the Notice).  The Notice, dated April 15, 1992, describes the violation
as being an illegal placement of fill in a floodplain in contravention of the
New Castle County Zoning and Drainage Codes.  United Water Delaware alleges that
the illegal fill was placed on land it owns by one or more third parties without
the knowledge or approval of United Water Delaware.  The management of United
Water Delaware has responded to the Notice by engaging hydrogeological engineers
to investigate the feasibility of a mitigation and remediation plan which would
be consistent with the appropriate County Ordinances.  Violation notice forms
also were issued to other similarly situated property owners, and United Water
Delaware has taken part in many discussions concerning the level of
participation by all such parties in a remediation.  United Water Delaware has
met with the New Castle County authorities and presented a plan to partially
remediate the fill.  It is expected that the County will accept this proposal.

           On October, 28, 1994, IU International Corporation (IU) filed suit in
the Superior Court of the State of Delaware against United Waterworks alleging 
breach of contract and seeking reimbursement from United Waterworks of more than
$3 million, as well as interest thereon. IU's claim is based on certain tax 
indemnifications that were part of a stock purchase agreement entered into by 
IU, Lyonnaise American Holding, Inc., United Waterworks and GWC in connection 
with the 1982 purchase of 50% of the outstanding common stock of United 
Waterworks by LAH. United Waterworks is engaged in settlement negotiations with 
IU, but no final settlement agreement has been executed by the parties. 
Management believes that the resolution of this matter will not have a material 
adverse effect upon the financial position or results of operations of the 
Company.

           United Water is not a party to any other litigation other than the 
routine litigation incidental to the business of United Water. None of such 
litigation, either individually or in the aggregate, is material to the business
of United Water.

ITEM 7.  MANAGEMENT'S  DISCUSSION  AND  ANALYSIS  OF  FINANCIAL CONDITION  AND
- -------  ----------------------------------------------------------------------
         RESULTS  OF  OPERATIONS
         -----------------------
MERGER
     On April 22, 1994, United Water Resources (United Water, or the Company)
completed a merger (the Merger) with GWC Corporation (GWC) in which United Water
was the surviving corporation.  GWC's principal assets included 100% of the
stock of General Waterworks Corporation, which owns regulated water and
wastewater utilities operating in 14 states, and a 25% indirect investment in
JMM Operational Services, Inc. (JMM).  JMM provides operations and management
services to government and industry for water and wastewater treatment
facilities.

     In March 1995, the Company changed the names of many of its operating
subsidiaries.  By adopting "United Water" in the names of its utility
subsidiaries, the Company will achieve a unified corporate identity and greater
national recognition.  The new names of some of the larger operating
subsidiaries are United Water New Jersey (formerly Hackensack Water Company),
United Waterworks (formerly General Waterworks Corporation) and United Water New
York (formerly Spring Valley Water Company).  In 1994, Rivervale Realty Company
changed its name to United Properties Group.  The new names are used hereafter.

     The operating water and wastewater utilities of United Waterworks are
individually much smaller in size than the combined utility operations of United
Water's primary pre-merger utility subsidiaries, United Water New Jersey and
United Water New York.  In the aggregate, however, United Waterworks' operating
utilities are approximately equal in size to United Water New Jersey and United
Water New York combined.  Following the Merger, the Company became the nation's
second largest investor-owned water services company serving approximately two
million people in 14 states.  The greater geographic diversity of United Water's
utility operations should serve to reduce the Company's risks related to weather
and rate regulation.

                                                                               3

                          United Water Resources Inc.

     As a result of the Merger, there were a number of substantial increases in
the Company's consolidated financial statements.  Significant changes in the
balance sheet included a $502 million increase in net utility plant, to more
than $1 billion, while total assets increased by $662 million, to $1.4 billion.
Total equity, including common, preferred and preference stock, increased by
$197 million, to $436 million, while long-term debt increased $212 million, to
$489 million.  Significant changes in the operating results are discussed in
Results of Operations.

     The Merger was accounted for as a purchase.  In exchange for the common
stock of GWC that was issued and outstanding immediately preceding the Merger,
United Water (i) issued 9,295,860 shares of United Water common stock, (ii)
issued 3,341,078 shares of United Water 5% cumulative convertible preference
stock, with a liquidation price of $13.794 per share, and (iii) paid former
shareholders of GWC $8.9 million in cash.  In addition, at the time of the
Merger, each issued and outstanding share of GWC 7 5/8% cumulative preferred
stock was converted into one fully paid non-assessable share of United Water 7
5/8% cumulative preferred stock with equal stated dividends and substantially
similar rights, privileges, qualifications and restrictions.

     Prior to the Merger, Lyonnaise American Holding, Inc. (LAH), a Delaware
corporation and a wholly-owned subsidiary of Lyonnaise des Eaux, a French
societe anonyme, owned approximately 81.9% of GWC's common stock; the remaining
18.1% of GWC's common stock was publicly traded.  On the date of the Merger, LAH
converted 70% of its shares of GWC common stock into United Water common stock
and the remainder of its shares of GWC common stock into United Water 5%
cumulative convertible preference stock.  Immediately after the Merger, LAH
owned approximately 25.4% of the issued and outstanding United Water common
stock and approximately 97.7% of the issued and outstanding United Water 5%
cumulative convertible preference stock.  A twelve-year Governance Agreement
between LAH and United Water contains a number of restrictions, including
restrictions on when LAH can convert its preference shares into United Water
common stock and on LAH's ability to buy or sell United Water common stock or
preference stock.

                                                                               4

     United Water's 1994 results include the operations of United Waterworks for
the nine months from April to December 1994.  It should be noted that the
results of operations for those nine months include the warmer, high demand
summer months, and therefore represent a significant portion of the total 1994
earnings of United Waterworks' operating utilities.

LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES

     As shown in the consolidated statement of cash flows, the Company's major
uses of cash in 1994 included:  $66.9 million of net capital expenditures; $5.1
million paid in connection with the Merger; $29.3 million of common, preferred
and preference dividends paid to shareholders; and $5.5 million invested in a
service contract with the city of Hoboken, New Jersey.  The major sources of
funds to meet these cash needs included:  $43.6 million of cash provided by
operations; a $37.1 million increase in short-term notes payable; and $23.2
million of proceeds from the issuance of additional shares of common stock.

     Net capital expenditures are generally incurred by United Water's utility
subsidiaries in connection with the normal upgrading and expansion of existing
water and wastewater facilities and to comply with existing environmental
regulations.  United Water considers its utility plant to be adequate and in
good condition.  However, the Company is projecting higher levels of capital
expenditures during the next five years due to the addition of new, or expansion
of existing, water treatment and source of supply facilities by United
Waterworks' utility subsidiaries.  These capital expenditures are necessary to
meet growth requirements and to comply with environmental laws and regulations.
Excluding the effects of inflation, the net capital expenditures of United
Water's utility subsidiaries are projected to aggregate $301 million over the
next five years, including $56 million and $63 million, respectively, in 1995
and 1996.  This total includes $226 million for United Waterworks and $75
million for United Water New Jersey and United Water New York.  The expenditures
related to compliance with environmental laws and regulations are estimated to
be approximately 25% of the projected net capital expenditures over the 1995-
1999 period.  To the best of management's knowledge, the Company is in
compliance with all major environmental laws and regulations.

                                                                               5
<PAGE>
 
                          United Water Resources Inc.

     United Water anticipates that its future capital expenditures will be
funded by internally generated funds, external debt financings and the issuance
of additional common and preferred stock, including shares issued to existing
shareholders, bondholders, customers and employees under the Company's dividend
reinvestment and stock purchase plans.  In addition, United Waterworks and
United Water New York are parties to a number of tax-exempt financings for the
purpose of funding capital expenditures.  Funds are drawn down on these
financings as qualified capital expenditures are made.  As of December 31, 1994,
$30.2 million of proceeds from these financings have not yet been disbursed to
the Company and are included in the consolidated balance sheet as restricted
cash.   The amount and timing of the use of these proceeds and of future
financings will depend on actual capital expenditures, the timeliness and
adequacy of rate relief, the availability and cost of capital, and the ability
to meet interest and fixed charge coverage requirements.

     There were a number of changes in the Company's long-term debt in 1994.  In
January 1994, United Water New Jersey redeemed $10 million of First Mortgage
Bonds, 9 3/4% Series, due in 2006.  United Water New Jersey also refinanced $40
million of tax-exempt bonds in April 1994 using the proceeds from the issuance
of $20 million of 5.8% bonds and $20 million of 5.9% bonds, both due in 2024.

     In June 1994, United Water New York refinanced $27 million of 1988 New York
State Environmental Facilities Corporation 7.7% - 8% notes, due in 2018, by
issuing $12 million of 6.15% notes and $15 million of 6.3% notes, both due in
2024.  In January 1995, United Water New York issued $12 million of 8.98% senior
notes, the proceeds of which were used to reduce short-term borrowings.  These
short-term borrowings were incurred, in part, when United Water New York
redeemed $5 million of Series E, 4.7% First Mortgage Bonds at maturity on 
August 1, 1994.

     In October 1994, the Idaho Water Resource Board issued $20 million of 6.4%
tax-exempt bonds on behalf of United Waterworks, due in 2024, to finance certain
capital expenditures of United Water Idaho (formerly Boise Water Corporation), a
subsidiary of United Waterworks. The proceeds from these

                                                                               6
<PAGE>
 
                          United Water Resources Inc.

tax-exempt bonds will be drawn down as qualified capital expenditures are made,
generally within three years of the issuance of the bonds. In December 1994,
United Waterworks entered into a private placement medium-term note program that
will enable United Waterworks to issue up to $75 million of debt with terms
ranging from 9 months to 30 years. The interest rates will be set as notes are
issued under the program. In February 1995, United Waterworks issued the first
$10 million of notes under this program, at a rate of 8.84%, with the full
amount maturing in 2025, and redeemed outstanding notes payable.

     In December 1994, United Water Mid-Atlantic (formerly Mid-Atlantic
Utilities Corporation), a subsidiary of United Water, issued $5.5 million of
long-term debt maturing in 2004 to finance the cost of a service contract with
the city of Hoboken.  The interest rate floats, based on the London Interbank
Offered Rate or a treasury rate index, and was 7.125% at December 31, 1994.

     At December 31, 1994, United Water had cash and cash equivalents of $9.8
million (excluding restricted cash) and unused short-term bank lines of credit
of $112.8 million.  Management expects that unused credit lines currently
available, cash flows provided by operations and cash generated from the
dividend reinvestment and stock purchase plans will be sufficient to meet
anticipated future operational needs.

RATE MATTERS

     The profitability of United Water's regulated utilities is, to a large
extent, dependent upon adequate and timely rate relief.  The Company anticipates
that the regulatory authorities that have jurisdiction over its utility
operations will allow the Company's regulated utilities to earn a reasonable
return on their utility investments.

     In October 1993, a rate increase of approximately 3.1%, or $3.5 million,
became effective for United Water New Jersey, the Company's largest utility
subsidiary.  This increase resulted from the settlement of a dispute involving a
transfer of land from United Water New Jersey to United Properties 

                                                                               7

                          United Water Resources Inc.

Group (United Properties). The increase had no effect on United Water's cash
flows in 1994 because offsetting credits related to the settlement are being
applied to customer bills until late 1995.

     Twelve rate increases were awarded to the Company's regulated utilities
during 1994, representing an aggregate annual revenue increase of $8.1 million.
An estimated $3.2 million of this amount was reflected in 1994's revenues while
the remaining $4.9 million of carryover impact of the rate awards received in
1994 is expected to increase revenues in 1995.

     At the end of January 1995, there were nine rate cases pending in which the
Company has requested an aggregate annual rate increase of $11.7 million.  Only
a portion of the rate increase, if received in 1995, will affect revenues in
1995.  Generally, the rate awards the Company's operating utilities actually
receive are less than the amounts requested.  The Company expects to file
additional rate cases in 1995, but does not expect that those rate awards, if
received in 1995, will have a significant impact on revenues in 1995.

                                                                               8

REAL ESTATE ACTIVITIES

     United Properties owns a portfolio of real estate located in New Jersey,
New York and Pennsylvania, consisting of commercial properties, golf courses and
land available for development.  United Properties is pursuing joint ventures,
sales, or direct development opportunities for the various properties in its
portfolio, as well as the acquisition of additional commercial and golf
properties.

     United Properties expects to spend $43.4 million over the next five years
for capital expenditures on its existing real estate portfolio, including $3.6
million and $17.4 million, respectively, in 1995 and 1996.  Funding for United
Properties' activities is anticipated to come from operations, including the
sales of properties and the operation of existing commercial properties and golf
courses, and from the proceeds of new financings.  The timing of these
expenditures will depend upon market conditions and the attainment of necessary
approvals.

RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

OVERVIEW

     United Water's net income applicable to common stock for 1994 was $27.9
million, an increase of 39.6% as compared to the $20 million earned in 1993.
This increase in net income was primarily attributable to the operations
acquired in the Merger.  Net income per common share for 1994 was $1.01 as
compared to $1.03 for 1993.  The Merger contributed positively to the Company's
earnings per share in 1994 even though 9.3 million shares of United Water common
stock were issued to effect the Merger.  Despite the favorable impact of the
Merger, earnings per share were lower than in 1993, primarily due to a one-time
gain from a real estate transfer in the third quarter of 1993 from United
Properties to United Water New Jersey and record water sales during the hot, dry
summer of 1993.  Due to regulatory treatment, the effects of the intercompany
real estate transaction were not eliminated in consolidation.

                                                                               9

REVENUES
     Operating revenues increased $92.6 million, or 46.2%, in 1994 and $35.5
million, or 21.6%, in 1993 from the prior years, as follows:

                            --------    -----       -------    ----
</TABLE>

          The Merger increased revenues $105.9 million, or 52.8%, in 1994 and
was the major reason for the 46.2% increase in revenues in 1994 as compared to
1993.  This includes the effect of any in-year rate increases granted to the
operating utilities of United Waterworks in 1994.  The 2.6% increase in revenues
from rate awards includes the impact of current year and prior year rate awards
for United Water New Jersey and United Water New York, and resulted from rate
increases of 5.7% and 3.8% in May 1993 and July 1994, respectively, for United
Water New York and from a 3.1% rate increase in October 1993 for United Water
New Jersey.  Lower consumption resulted in a decrease in revenues of $3.5
million in 1994 as weather conditions returned to a more normal pattern after a
very hot, dry summer season in 1993.  Real estate revenues decreased primarily
due to the $26 million land transfer from United Properties to United Water New
Jersey in 1993.  Revenues from meter installation contracts for the city of New
York and a service contract with the city of Hoboken contributed to the increase
in other operations in 1994.

          Revenues in 1993 increased 21.6% over 1992.  The increase was
primarily attributable to a $23.2 million, or 14.1%, increase in real estate
revenues resulting from the aforementioned land transfer.  The 1.2% increase in
utility revenues from rate awards was the result of a 5.7% United Water New York
rate increase in May 1993, a 3.1% United Water New Jersey rate increase in
October 1993 and the recognition of approximately $1 million of deferred revenue
credits relating to United Water New York's

                                                                              10

rate case. The 5.6% increase in consumption in 1993 was attributable to
increases in United Water New Jersey's water sales due to an unusually hot and
dry summer.

COSTS AND EXPENSES

          The changes in operating expenses in 1994 as compared to 1993,
including the effect of the Merger, were as follows:

                          -------  ----   -------     -------    ----
</TABLE>

          The decrease in operation and maintenance expenses, excluding the
impact of the Merger, represents the net effect of the decrease in costs related
to the real estate transfer in 1993, offset in part by higher costs in 1994
related to the Company's utility operations, meter installations under contracts
with the city of New York, other property sales and the service contract with
the city of Hoboken.  The operation and maintenance expenses of the Company's
utility operations increased $1.9 million, or 2.9%, in 1994.  The increase in
general taxes of $1.8 million, or 6%, in 1994 was primarily attributable to
higher real estate taxes as well as the recognition in 1993 of $755,000 of
credits in franchise and real estate taxes relating to United Water New York's
rate case.

          The changes in operating expenses in 1993 as compared to 1992 were as
follows:

                                                                              11

</TABLE>
          Operation and maintenance expenses increased $25.2 million, or 33.5%,
from 1992.  This increase was primarily due to real estate activity, including
the $15.5 million cost of the real estate transferred from United Properties to
United Water New Jersey and a $4.1 million valuation reserve recorded on other
real estate properties during 1993.  The remaining increase of $5.6 million, or
7.4%, was primarily caused by higher utility operating expenses, in part, due to
increased water sales related to the hot, dry summer in 1993, and the
recognition of $850,000 of deferred expenses related to United Water New York's
1993 rate case.

          General taxes were $1.2 million, or 4%, higher in 1993 over 1992, due
principally to increases of 2.1% in revenue based taxes and 8.4% in property
related taxes, less the recognition in 1993 of $755,000 of credits in franchise
and real estate taxes relating to United Water New York's rate case.

INTEREST AND OTHER

          Consolidated interest expense increased 62.6% in 1994 as compared to
1993, primarily due to the Merger, and decreased 1% in 1993 as compared to 1992,
due to lower interest rates on short-term borrowings and a reduction in long-
term debt.

          Other income was $4.5 million higher in 1994 as compared to 1993,
primarily due to the award of escrow monies to United Properties following a
foreclosure settlement and a gain on the sale of a wastewater transmission
facility in Pine Bluff, Arkansas.

INCOME TAXES

          The effective income tax rates on income before preferred and
preference stock dividends were 38% in 1994, 36% in 1993 and 31.1% in 1992.  The
increases in the effective rates in 1994 and 1993, as compared to the preceding
years, resulted from higher state income taxes and additional provisions for
federal income taxes.  The higher state income taxes in 1994 were primarily a
result of the operations 

                                                                              12

acquired in the Merger and in 1993 were attributable to land sales. An analysis
of income taxes is included in Note 11 to the financial statements.

EFFECTS OF INFLATION

          Operating income from utility operations is normally not materially
affected by inflation because cost increases generally lead to proportionate
increases in revenues allowed through the regulatory process.  However, there is
a lag in the recovery of higher expenses through the regulatory process, and
therefore, high inflation could have a detrimental effect on the Company until
rate increases are received.  Conversely, lower inflation and lower interest
rates tend to result in reductions in the rates of return allowed by the utility
commissions, as has happened over the last several years.

                       REPORT OF INDEPENDENT ACCOUNTANTS



To The Board of Directors of
United Water Resources



        In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements listed in the
accompanying index present fairly, in all material respects, the financial
position of United Water Resources and its subsidiaries at December 31, 1994 and
1993, and the results of their operations and their cash flows for each of the
three years in the period ended December 31, 1994, in conformity with generally
accepted accounting principles.  These financial statements are the
responsibility of United Water Resources' management; our responsibility is to
express an opinion on these financial statements based on our audits.  We
conducted our audits of these statements in accordance with generally accepted
auditing standards which require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material
misstatement.  An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting
the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements, assessing the
accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, and
evaluating the overall financial statement presentation.  We believe that our
audits provide a reasonable basis for the opinion expressed above.

                   NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

NOTE 1 - SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

PRINCIPLES OF CONSOLIDATION:  The consolidated financial statements include the
accounts of United Water Resources (United Water, or the Company) and its more
than 50% owned subsidiaries.  The Company accounts for investments in which it
has significant influence under the equity method of accounting.  Certain prior
year amounts have been reclassified to conform with current year presentation.

DESCRIPTION OF BUSINESS:  In March 1995, the Company changed the names of many
of its operating subsidiaries, including pre-merger United Water operations, as
well as those acquired in the April 1994 merger (the Merger) with GWC
Corporation (GWC) as discussed in Note 2.  By adopting "United Water" in the
names of its utility subsidiaries, the Company will achieve a unified corporate
identity and greater national recognition.  The new names of some of the larger
operating subsidiaries are United Water New Jersey (formerly Hackensack Water
Company), United Waterworks (formerly General Waterworks Corporation) and United
Water New York (formerly Spring Valley Water Company).  In 1994, Rivervale
Realty Company changed its name to United Properties Group.  The new names are
used hereafter.

United Water's principal utility subsidiaries include United Water New Jersey,
United Water New York and United Waterworks.  These subsidiaries provide water
and wastewater services to two million people in 14 states.  Other significant
wholly-owned subsidiaries of United Water include:  United Properties Group
(United Properties), which is engaged in real estate activities including
commercial rentals, land development, golf course operations and consulting
services; Laboratory Resources, a network of 

                                                                              20

                          United Water Resources Inc.

environmental testing laboratories; and United Water Mid-Atlantic (formerly Mid-
Atlantic Utilities Corporation), which owns and operates water and wastewater
systems.

United Water's utility subsidiaries are subject to regulation by the public
utility commissions of the states in which they operate.  Their accounting must
comply with the applicable uniform system of accounts prescribed by these
regulatory commissions and must also conform to generally accepted accounting
principles as applied to rate regulated public utilities.  This accounting
allows, among other things, the recognition of intercompany profit in situations
where it is probable such profit will be recovered in the ratemaking process and
the recording of assets and liabilities not generally recorded by non-regulated
enterprises.

UTILITY PLANT:  Utility plant is recorded at original cost, which includes
direct and indirect labor and material costs associated with construction
activities, related operating overheads and an allowance for funds used during
construction (AFUDC).  AFUDC is a non-cash credit to income and includes both
the cost of borrowed funds and a return on equity funds attributable to plant
under construction.

The original cost of utility property retired or otherwise disposed of in the
normal course of business is charged to accumulated depreciation, and salvage
(net of removal cost) is credited thereto;  no gain or loss is recognized.  The
costs of property repairs, replacements and renewals of minor property items are
included in maintenance expense when incurred.

ADVANCES AND CONTRIBUTIONS IN AID OF CONSTRUCTION:  When required by the public
utility commissions of the states in which the Company's utility subsidiaries
operate, outside parties, generally customers and 

                                                                              21

                          United Water Resources Inc.

developers, make payments to the Company to fund certain utility capital
expenditures to provide water or wastewater service to new customers. Non-
refundable amounts received by the Company are recorded as contributions in aid
of construction, except where the Company is required to record such amounts
directly as a reduction to utility plant. Refundable amounts received are
recorded as advances, and are refundable, for limited periods of time, generally
as new customers begin to receive service. The remaining balance of any advances
received, after the Company has made all required refunds of such advances, is
transferred to contributions in aid of construction.

The balances of advances and contributions are used to reduce utility plant in
determining rate base, and plant funded by advances and contributions is
generally not depreciated.  However, the public utility commissions in several
of the states in which the Company operates permit the depreciation of plant
funded by contributions in aid of construction, but also require that
contributions be amortized, so that there is no net effect on income from the
depreciation of the contributed plant.  For income tax purposes, advances and
contributions received after 1986 are included as taxable income, and the
related plant is depreciated for tax purposes.

UTILITY PLANT ACQUISITION ADJUSTMENTS:  Utility plant acquisition adjustments
represent the difference between the purchase price and the book value of net
assets acquired, and are amortized, generally, on a straight-line basis over a
40-year period.  Utility plant acquisition adjustments include a premium paid to
acquire the operating utilities of GWC in the Merger.

JOINTLY OWNED FACILITIES:  Utility plant includes United Water New Jersey's 50%
interest in the Wanaque South Water Supply Project, the net book value of which
was $45 million and $46 million at 

                                                                              22
<PAGE>
 
                          United Water Resources Inc.

December 31, 1994 and 1993, respectively. United Water New Jersey's share of the
project's operating expenses is included in operation and maintenance expenses.

REGULATORY ASSETS AND LIABILITIES:  Included in deferred charges and other
assets and in deferred credits and other liabilities are regulatory items which
are expected to be recognized when included in future rates and recovered from
or refunded to customers as directed by the state public utility commissions.
These regulatory assets and liabilities include items that the public utility
commissions have ordered the Company's regulated utilities to defer and
prudently incurred costs where the Company expects that recovery is probable
because of the past practices of the public utility commissions.

Two of the more significant categories of regulatory assets and liabilities
involve income taxes (see Income taxes below) and postretirement employee
benefits, including pensions and health care.  As of December 31, 1994, prepaid
employee benefits include $11.5 million of prepaid pension costs and $12.8
million of prepaid and deferred postretirement health care benefits.  Most of
the postretirement costs relate to employees and retirees of the Company's
utility subsidiaries.  Postretirement health care costs in excess of those
currently included in rates have been deferred in those jurisdictions where
their recovery is deemed probable.

REAL ESTATE:  Real estate properties are carried at the lower of cost, which
includes original purchase price and direct development costs, or net realizable
value.  Real estate taxes and interest costs are capitalized during the
development period.  The amount of interest capitalized was $2.7 million in
1994, $2.6 million in 1993 and $3 million in 1992.  Real estate operating
revenues include rental income from commercial  

                                                                              23
<PAGE>
 
                          United Water Resources Inc.

properties, proceeds from the disposition of real estate properties, revenues
from golf course operations and fees from consulting services.

Proceeds and costs related to pending real estate transactions which do not
qualify as completed sales for accounting purposes are recorded under the
deposit method.  At December 31, 1993, proceeds of approximately $17 million
were recorded as deferred credits.  At December 31, 1994, there were no pending
real estate transactions recorded under the deposit method.

UNAMORTIZED DEBT EXPENSE:  Debt premium, debt discount and deferred debt
expenses are amortized to income or expense over the lives of the applicable
issues.

REVENUES:  United Water New Jersey and United Waterworks recognize as revenues
billings to customers, plus estimated revenues for consumption for the period
from the date of the last billing to the balance sheet date.  United Water New
York recognizes revenues as bills are rendered to customers and does not accrue
for unbilled revenues.  United Water New York and United Water New Rochelle
(formerly the New Rochelle Water Company) have been directed by the New York
Public Service Commission (New York PSC) to institute a Revenue Reconciliation
Clause, which requires the reconciliation of billed revenues with pro forma
revenues that were used to set rates.  Any variances outside a 1% range are
accrued or deferred for subsequent recovery from or refund to customers.  At
December 31, 1994, United Water New York and United Water New Rochelle had $1.4
million of net unamortized revenue deferrals which are available to offset other
incremental deferred costs or to be refunded to customers over a three-year
period.  These deferrals were related to revenues in excess of amounts used to
set rates, reductions in federal income taxes and reductions in pension expense.

                                                                              24
<PAGE>
 
                          United Water Resources Inc.

DEPRECIATION:  Depreciation of utility plant and real estate properties is
recognized using the straight-line method over the estimated service lives of
the properties.  Utility plant depreciation rates are prescribed by the public
utility commissions.  The provisions for depreciation in 1994, 1993 and 1992
were equivalent to 2.1%, 2.2% and 2.2%, respectively, of average depreciable
utility plant in service.  For federal income tax purposes, depreciation is
computed using accelerated methods and, in general, shorter depreciable lives as
permitted under the Internal Revenue Code.

INCOME TAXES:  The Company and its eligible subsidiaries file a consolidated
federal income tax return.  Effective January 1, 1993, the Company adopted
Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 109, "Accounting for
Income Taxes."  SFAS No. 109 requires that deferred income taxes be recorded to
reflect an estimate of future tax liability based on temporary differences
between the financial and tax bases of assets and liabilities.  This adjustment
includes deferred taxes for utility temporary differences not previously
recognized and the effect on the liability of changes in tax laws and rates.
The adoption of SFAS No. 109 in 1993 resulted in the recording of a deferred tax
liability and an offsetting regulatory asset.  This regulatory asset represents
the probable increase in revenues that will be received through future
ratemaking proceedings for the recovery of those deferred taxes.  The adoption
of SFAS No. 109 did not have a material effect on net income.

For 1992, the provision for income taxes represents the estimated amounts
currently payable for the period plus the changes in net deferred taxes relating
to differences between income for accounting and tax purposes for certain items
as discussed in Note 11.  Deferred tax expense is provided for timing
differences between financial and income tax reporting, except where not allowed
in the rate process.

                                                                              25
<PAGE>
 
                          United Water Resources Inc.

Investment tax credits arising from property additions are deferred and
amortized over the estimated service lives of the related properties.

STATEMENT OF CASH FLOWS:  United Water considers all highly liquid investments
with original maturities of three months or less to be cash equivalents.  The
Company made cash payments for interest (net of amounts capitalized) and federal
and state income taxes as follows:

NOTE 2 - MERGER

On April 22, 1994, United Water completed the Merger with GWC, in which United
Water was the surviving corporation.  GWC's principal assets included 100% of
the stock of General Waterworks Corporation (presently known as United
Waterworks), which owns regulated water and wastewater utilities operating in 14
states, and a 25% indirect investment in JMM Operational Services, Inc. (JMM).
JMM provides operations and management services to government and industry for
water and wastewater treatment facilities.  The Merger was accounted for under
the purchase method and resulted in the recording of a utility plant acquisition
adjustment of $67 million.  In exchange for the common stock of GWC that was
issued and outstanding immediately preceding the Merger, United Water (i) issued
9,295,860 shares of United Water common stock, (ii) issued 3,341,078 shares of
United Water 5% cumulative convertible preference stock, with a liquidation
price of $13.794 per share, and (iii) paid former shareholders of GWC $8.9
million in cash. In addition, each share of GWC 7 5/8% cumulative preferred
stock outstanding at the time of the Merger was converted into one fully paid
non-assessable share of United Water 7 5/8% cumulative preferred stock, with
equal stated dividends and substantially similar rights, privileges,
qualifications and restrictions.

Prior to the Merger, Lyonnaise American Holding, Inc. (LAH), a Delaware
corporation and a wholly-owned subsidiary of Lyonnaise des Eaux, a French
societe anonyme, owned approximately 81.9% of GWC's common stock.  The remaining
18.1% of GWC's common stock was publicly traded.  On the date of the Merger, LAH
converted 70% of its shares of GWC common stock into United Water common stock
and the remainder of its shares of GWC common stock into United Water 5%
cumulative convertible preference stock.  Immediately after the Merger, LAH
owned approximately 25.4% of the issued and outstanding United Water common
stock and approximately 97.7% of the issued and outstanding United 

                                                                              27

                          United Water Resources Inc.

Water 5% cumulative convertible preference stock. A twelve year Governance
Agreement between LAH and United Water contains a number of restrictions,
including restrictions on when LAH can convert its preference shares into United
Water common stock and on LAH's ability to buy or sell United Water common stock
or preference stock.

The financial results of the former subsidiaries of GWC are included in United
Water's financial results beginning April 1, 1994.  The following unaudited pro
forma condensed income statement information gives effect to the Merger as if it
had occurred at the beginning of 1994 and 1993.  Pro forma results are not
necessarily indicative of what actually would have occurred had the acquisition
been in effect for the periods presented.  In addition, the pro forma results
are not intended to be a projection of future results.

NOTE 3 - NOTES PAYABLE

United Water and its subsidiaries have a number of credit lines with banks.
Borrowings under these credit lines generally bear interest at rates between the
London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR) and the prime lending rate.  United Water
maintains balances and pays commitment fees under arrangements with certain of
these banks to compensate them for services and to support these lines of
credit.  There are no legal restrictions placed on the withdrawal or other use
of these bank balances.

The total credit lines, the amounts outstanding and the range of interest rates
at December 31 were as follows:

NOTE 4 - LONG-TERM DEBT

The long-term debt repayments over each of the next five years are as follows:
1995-$9.9 million; 1996-$13.6 million; 1997-$29.7 million; 1998-$23.7 million
and 1999-$25.3 million.  Substantially all of the utility plant of United Water
New Jersey and United Water New York is subject to first mortgage liens, and
both companies, as well as United Waterworks and other subsidiaries of United
Water, are subject to certain restrictive covenants related to debt issued by
those subsidiaries.

In July 1993, United Water New Jersey redeemed $10 million of its $20 million, 9
3/4% Series, First Mortgage Bonds, due in 2006, and redeemed the remaining $10
million in January 1994.  In April 1994, United Water New Jersey refinanced $40
million of tax-exempt bonds, using the proceeds from the issuance of $20 million
of 5.8% bonds and $20 million of 5.9% bonds, both due in 2024.

In June 1994, United Water New York refinanced $27 million of 1988 New York
State Environmental Facilities Corporation (New York EFC) 7.7% - 8% notes, due
in 2018, by issuing $12 million of 6.15% notes and $15 million of 6.3% notes,
both due in 2024.

In October 1994, the Idaho Water Resources Board issued $20 million of 6.4% tax-
exempt bonds on behalf of United Waterworks, due in 2024, to finance certain
capital expenditures of United Water Idaho (formerly Boise Water Corporation), a
subsidiary of United Waterworks.  In December 1994, United Waterworks entered
into a private placement medium-term note program that will enable United
Waterworks to issue up to $75 million of debt with terms ranging from 9 months
to 30 years.  The interest rates will be set as notes are issued under this
program.

                                                                              30

                          United Water Resources Inc.

In December 1994, United Water Mid-Atlantic issued $5.5 million of long-term
debt, maturing in 2004.  The interest rate floats, based on LIBOR or a treasury
rate index, and was 7.125% at December 31, 1994.

In November 1993, United Properties repaid $1.5 million of an existing $9.5
million mortgage on an office building and refinanced the remaining $8 million
with a floating rate term loan, due in 2000.  The interest rate (7% at December
31, 1994) is established every 30 days and is based on LIBOR plus a premium.

In December 1993, the New York EFC issued $12 million of 5.65%, tax-exempt Water
Facilities Revenue Bonds, due in 2023.  The bonds, which have optional
redemption provisions, were issued on behalf of United Water New York to finance
construction programs through 1995 and are insured as to the payment of interest
and principal by the AMBAC Indemnity Corporation.

NOTE 5 - CAPITAL EXPENDITURES

The future net capital expenditures of the Company's utility subsidiaries are
projected to aggregate $301 million over the next five years, including $56
million and $63 million, respectively, in 1995 and 1996.  United Properties
currently projects spending $43.4 million over the next five years for capital
expenditures on its existing real estate portfolio, including $3.6 million and
$17.4 million, respectively, in 1995 and 1996.

NOTE 6 - PREFERRED AND PREFERENCE STOCK

The utility subsidiaries of the Company have issued and outstanding cumulative
preferred stock, generally with mandatory redemption provisions requiring annual
sinking fund payments.  These sinking fund requirements total $260,000 in each
of the years 1995 through 1997 and $2,073,000 in each of 1998 and 1999.  The
redemption of cumulative preferred stock was $260,000 in each of 1994 and 1993
and $880,000 in 1992.  In addition, except as described in the next paragraph,
optional sinking fund provisions can be exercised and redemptions made at
specific prices for all preferred stock issues.  Redemptions require payment of
accrued and unpaid dividends to the date fixed for redemption.

As discussed in Note 2, the Merger resulted in the issuance by United Water of
3,341,078 shares ($46 million par value) of 5% Series A cumulative convertible
preference stock, valued at $43.3 million at the time of the Merger and $30
million of 7 5/8% Series B cumulative preferred stock, valued at $31.1 million
at the time of the Merger. LAH owns 97.7% of the Series A preference stock
outstanding. The Series B preferred stock has a $1.5 million mandatory annual
redemption commencing in 1998. Shares of the Series B preferred stock may not be
redeemed by the Company prior to September 1, 1997. Each share of the Series A
preference stock outstanding may be converted into .83333 shares of United Water
common stock at any time commencing April 22, 1996. However, under the
Governance Agreement between United Water and LAH, LAH may convert 10% of the
Series A preference stock it owns during the year commencing April 22, 1996, and
an additional 10% cumulatively per year thereafter until April 22, 2003, at
which time these conversion restrictions end. United Water may not redeem any of
the outstanding, unconverted Series A preference stock prior to maturity on
April 22, 2004.

                                                                              32

All options are currently exercisable and represent the only stock options
outstanding at December 31, 1994.  A total of 1,140,625 common shares are
reserved for issuance under the management incentive plan.

In May 1993, the shareholders approved the creation of dividend units to be
issued in conjunction with stock options granted under the management incentive
plan.  One dividend unit may be attached to each unexercised option to purchase
a share of United Water common stock, and entitles the option holder to accrue,
as a credit against the option exercise price, the aggregate dividends actually
paid on a share of United Water common stock while the dividend unit is in
effect.  The dividend units are designed to create an incentive for option
holders to exercise their options and ties that incentive to the dividend
payments 

                                                                              33

on the common stock.  United Water recorded compensation expense of
$274,000 in 1994 and $47,000 in 1993 with respect to the management incentive
plan.

In May 1988, the shareholders approved a restricted stock plan for certain key
employees.  United Water issued 3,750 shares in 1994, 7,500 shares in 1993 and
16,353 shares in 1992 in connection with the restricted stock plan.  Such shares
are earned by the recipients over a 5-year period.  United Water recorded
compensation expense of $93,000 in 1994, $301,000 in 1993 and $241,000 in 1992
with respect to this restricted stock plan.

NOTE 8 - SHAREHOLDER RIGHTS PLAN

In July 1989, the board of directors of United Water approved a Shareholder
Rights Plan designed to protect shareholders against unfair and unequal
treatment in the event of a proposed takeover. It also guards against partial
tender offers and other hostile tactics to gain control of United Water without
paying all shareholders a fair price.  Under the plan, each share of United
Water's common stock also represents one Series A Participating Preferred Stock
Purchase Right (Right) until the Rights become exercisable.  The Rights attach
to all of United Water's common stock outstanding as of August 1, 1989, or
subsequently issued, and expire on August 1, 1999.

The Rights would be exercisable only if a person or group acquired 20% or more
of United Water's common stock or announced a tender offer that would lead to
ownership by a person or group of 20% or more of the common stock.

                                                                              34
<PAGE>
 
                          United Water Resources Inc.

In certain cases where an acquirer purchased more than 20% of United Water's
common stock, the Rights would allow shareholders (other than the acquirer) to
purchase shares of United Water's common stock at 50% of market price,
diminishing the value of the acquirer's shares and diluting the acquirer's
equity position in United Water.  If United Water were acquired in a merger or
other business combination transaction, under certain circumstances the Rights
could be used to purchase shares in the acquirer at 50% of the market price.
Subject to certain conditions, if a person or group acquired 20% or more of
United Water's common stock, United Water's board of directors may exchange each
Right held by shareholders (other than the acquirer) for one share of common
stock or 1/100 of a share of Series A Participating Preferred Stock.  If an
acquirer successfully purchased 80% of United Water's common stock after
tendering for all of the stock, the Rights would not operate.  If holders of a
majority of the shares of United Water's common stock approved a proposed
acquisition under specified circumstances, the Rights would be redeemed at one
cent each.  They could also be redeemed by United Water's board of directors for
one cent each at any time prior to the acquisition of 20% of the common stock by
an acquirer.

On September 15, 1993, United Water's Shareholder Rights Plan was amended in
connection with United Water's execution of a merger agreement with GWC
Corporation.  The amendment generally excepts the majority stockholder of GWC
Corporation and its affiliates and associates from triggering the Rights through
the execution of the merger agreement, the performance of the transactions
contemplated therein or otherwise.

                                                                              35

NOTE 9 - EMPLOYEE BENEFITS

POSTRETIREMENT BENEFIT PLANS OTHER THAN PENSIONS:  In January 1993, the Company
adopted SFAS No. 106, "Employers' Accounting for Postretirement Benefits Other
Than Pensions."  This standard requires that employers recognize these benefits
on an accrual basis rather than on a cash basis.

The Company sponsors a defined benefit postretirement plan that covers
hospitalization, major medical benefits and life insurance benefits for salaried
and non-salaried employees.  The Company is funding a portion of its
postretirement health care benefits through contributions to Voluntary
Employees' Beneficiary Association (VEBA) Trusts.

Effective January 1, 1995, the Company made a number of changes to its medical
plan for active employees and retirees.  These amendments include the
requirement that active employees and retirees pay a greater share of the cost
of their medical coverage.

The following sets forth the plan's funded status and reconciles that funded
status to the amounts recognized in the Company's balance sheet as of December
31:

Net periodic postretirement benefit cost for 1994 and 1993 included the
following components:

                                            --------  -------
</TABLE>

The assumed discount rate and expected return on assets used in determining the
APBO were as follows:

<TABLE>
<CAPTION>
                             1994   1993
                             ----   ----

Expected return on assets    8.25%  8.25%
                             ----   ----
</TABLE>

The associated health care cost trend rate used in measuring the postretirement
benefit obligation at December 31, 1994 was 13.3%, gradually declining to 5.5%
in 2002 and thereafter.  Increasing the assumed health care cost trend rate by
one percentage point in each year would increase the APBO as of December 31,
1994 by $4.9 million, to a total of $44.9 million, and the aggregate service and
interest cost components of net periodic postretirement benefit cost for 1994 by
$778,000, to a total of $6.5 million.  Postretirement health care costs in
excess of those currently included in rates have been deferred in those
jurisdictions where their recovery is deemed probable.  At December 31, 1994 and
1993, United Water New Jersey and United Water New York had deferred balances of
$6.5 million and $3.4 million, respectively, for recovery in future rates.
Prior to the Merger, GWC had not adopted SFAS No. 106 because it did not
consider the impact of adopting SFAS No. 106 to be material.  However, at the
date of the Merger, GWC's postretirement benefit obligation was recalculated
using revised assumptions and the Company recorded both the unfunded liability
and an estimate of the amount of that liability expected to be recoverable in
the regulatory process.  Because of the rate recovery mechanism, the adoption of
SFAS No. 106 has not had a material effect on the Company's consolidated net
income.

                                                                              37

                          United Water Resources Inc.

DEFINED BENEFIT PENSION PLANS:  Most of United Water's employees are covered by
trusteed, non-contributory, defined benefit pension plans.  Benefits under these
plans are based upon years of service and the employee's compensation during the
last five years of employment.  United Water's policy is to fund amounts accrued
for pension expense to the extent deductible for federal income tax purposes.
It is expected that no funding will be made for 1994.

The components of net periodic pension cost were as follows:

SUPPLEMENTAL BENEFIT PLANS:  Certain categories of employees are covered by non-
funded supplemental plans.  The projected benefit obligations of these plans at
December 31, 1994 totaled $5.4 million.  The unfunded accumulated benefit
obligation of $4.7 million has been recorded in other deferred credits and
liabilities and an intangible pension asset of $776,000 is included in deferred
charges and other assets at December 31, 1994.

United Water made contributions of $921,000, $552,000 and $562,000 in 1994, 1993
and 1992, respectively, to defined contribution savings plans.

                                                                              40

Note 10 - RATE MATTERS

In October 1993, United Water New Jersey was granted a rate increase of
approximately $3.5 million, or 3.1%.   This increase, which resulted from the
settlement of a dispute involving a transfer of land from United Water New
Jersey to United Properties, had no cash flow effect on United Water in 1994
because offsetting credits related to the settlement are being applied to
customer bills until late in 1995.  In May 1993, United Water New York was
granted a rate increase of approximately $1.9 million, or 5.7%.  The New York
PSC also allowed United Water New York to recover approximately $850,000 of
previously deferred expenses and required it to refund certain revenue credits
of approximately $1 million.  This action, which resulted in a one-time increase
in revenues and various expenses during 1993, did not have a material effect on
net income.

Twelve rate increases were awarded to the Company's regulated utilities during
1994, representing an aggregate annual revenue increase of $8.1 million.  An
estimated $3.2 million of this amount was reflected in 1994's revenues while the
remaining $4.9 million of carryover impact of the rate awards received in 1994
is expected to increase revenues in 1995.

                                                                              41

The Company's federal income tax returns for 1989, 1990 and 1991 are currently

consolidated financial position of United Water.

NOTE 12 - FAIR VALUE OF FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS

The carrying amount at December 31, 1994 of those current assets and liabilities
which are considered financial instruments approximates their fair value at that
date because of the short maturity of those instruments.  Such current assets
and liabilities include cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivable and
unbilled revenues, notes payable, accounts payable and accrued interest and
other current liabilities.  Real estate and other investments consist primarily
of real estate and investments in affiliates accounted for using the equity
method of accounting, substantially all of which are not financial instruments.
The Company understands that there are no quoted market prices for the Company's
preferred stock, preference stock or long-term debt.  The fair values of the
Company's long-term debt and preferred and preference stock have been determined
by discounting their future cash flows using approximate current market interest
rates for securities of a similar nature and duration.


The estimated fair values of United Water's financial instruments at December 31
are as follows:

                                       --------  --------
</TABLE>

The Company's customer advances for construction have a carrying value of
$30,459 and $9,319 at December 31, 1994 and 1993, respectively.  Their relative
fair values cannot be accurately estimated since future refund payments depend
on several variables, including new customer connections, customer consumption
levels and future rate increases.

                                                                              44

NOTE 14 - POSSIBLE CONDEMNATION

United Waterworks owns a utility subsidiary which provides water and wastewater
services to customers in Rio Rancho, New Mexico.  The city of Rio Rancho (the
City) notified United Waterworks that it intends to acquire the Company's
utility operations, and on October 28, 1994 commenced condemnation proceedings.
On December 15, 1994, the City filed an amended petition for condemnation
seeking immediate possession of the Company's utility system.  The Company has
responded to the court that the City's petition should be denied.

New Mexico's condemnation laws require that the City pay the Company fair market
value for any assets that are taken by the City in a condemnation proceeding.
Consequently, the Company expects that any condemnation, or sale in lieu of
condemnation, should result in the Company at least recovering the book value of
its Rio Rancho utility.  In 1994, the Company's Rio Rancho utility had revenues
of $11.6 million.

                                                                              46

          The information called for by Items 10 (including information relating
to delinquent filers under Section 16 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934),
11, 12 and 13 is omitted because the registrant will file with the Securities
and Exchange Commission, not later than 120 days after the close of the year
covered by this Form 10-K, a definitive proxy statement pursuant to Regulation
14A involving the election of directors.

          In determining which persons may be affiliates of the registrant for
the purpose of disclosing on the cover page of this Form 10-K the market value
of voting shares held by non-affiliates, the registrant has excluded shares held
by the members of its Board of Directors, executive officers and beneficial
owners of more than 10% of the common stock outstanding to the extent that they
have not disclaimed beneficial ownership. No determination has been made that
any director or person connected with a director is an affiliate or that any
other person is not an affiliate.  The registrant specifically disclaims any
intent to characterize any person as being or not being an affiliate.

                                                                               1

by written notice to the Company, specifying the event relied upon for such
termination and given within 180 days after such event.

     8.   Payments Upon Termination of Employment.  In the event the Employee's
          ---------------------------------------                              
employment under this Agreement is terminated by reason of the Employee's death
or total and permanent disability, or by the Company or any of its subsidiaries
or affiliates for any reason specified in Paragraph 7(A) or 7(B) above, this
Agreement shall terminate and be deemed cancelled and except as provided in
Paragraph 12 of this Agreement, the Companies shall be under no obligation
hereunder either to continue the Employee's employment or to provide the
Employee with any payment or benefit of any kind whatsoever, except for such
payments or benefits to which the Employee may otherwise be entitled
notwithstanding the provisions of this Agreement.

     In the event of any termination of employment (prior to the expiration of
the Period of Employment) by the Employee pursuant to Paragraph 7(C) above, or
in the event the employee's employment under this Agreement is terminated (prior
to the expiration of the Period of Employment) by the Company or any of its
subsidiaries or affiliates for any reason other than the Employee's death, total
and permanent disability or one of those reasons specified in Paragraph 7(A) or
7(B) above, the Companies shall, subject to Paragraphs 8(H) and 8(I) below, pay
the Employee (or, in the event of the Employee's death after such termination
but prior to the time payment hereunder is made, the Employee's estate), as
liquidated damages or severance pay, or both, the amounts described in
Subparagraphs (A) through (F) below:

          (A) The Employee shall be paid the excess of:

               (i)  the amount of fixed salary otherwise payable during the
                    Period of Employment that remains after the Employee's
                    termination of employment hereunder, as determined pursuant
                    to Paragraph 4(A)(i) above (excluding, however, any
                    "periodic increases" provided in such Paragraph that would
                    otherwise have become effective after the Employee's
                    termination of employment hereunder), increased, however, by
                    five percent (5%) for each calendar year commencing during
                    the Period of Employment and after the date of the
                    Employee's termination of employment hereunder; plus any
                    incentive compensation and bonuses that would otherwise have
                    been payable during such remaining Period of Employment
                    pursuant to Paragraph 4(A)(ii) above, computed on the
                    assumption that any objectives for full payment of same are
                    obtained but not exceeded, over

                                                                               7
<PAGE>
 
               (ii) the amounts, if any, paid to the Employee pursuant to any
                    severance, separation or termination pay program or
                    arrangement of the Company or any of its subsidiaries or
                    affiliates.

Payment of such amount shall commence with the month in which the Employee's
termination of employment hereunder shall occur.  Payments under this Paragraph
8(A) attributable to "fixed salary" amounts shall continue to be made in equal
installments at the times provided for payment of fixed salary in Paragraph
4(A), above.  Payments under this Paragraph 8(A) attributable to incentive
compensation and bonuses shall be made at the respective time or times provided
for payment of incentive compensation and bonuses in Paragraph 4(A) above,
provided, however, that all such incentive compensation and bonus payments under
this Paragraph 8(A) shall be made no later than the last day of the Period of
Employment.

          (B) The Employee shall be paid the excess of:

               (i)  the actuarially determined present value of the vested
                    benefit the Employee would have accrued under the Retirement
                    Plan had the Employee continued in full-time employment
                    under this Agreement throughout the Period of Employment
                    remaining after the Employee's termination of employment
                    hereunder at an annual rate of compensation equal to that
                    specified in Paragraph 8(A) above, over

               (ii) the actuarially determined present value of the vested
                    benefit accrued by the Employee under such Retirement Plan
                    to the date of the Employee's actual termination of
                    employment hereunder.

Notwithstanding any provision of the Retirement Plan, the benefit provided under
this Paragraph 8(B) shall be determined with reference to the benefit formula of
the Retirement Plan as in effect on the date first written above and shall be
computed (for purposes of determining a present value hereunder) as a life
annuity payable for the Employee's lifetime only, and deemed to commence at the
earliest date the Employee could elect to receive vested retirement benefits
under the Retirement Plan after his termination of employment hereunder.  The
actuarially determined present value of benefits payable under this Paragraph
8(B) shall be determined by using a discount factor equal to one percentage
point below the interest rate last publicly announced, as of the date on which
the Employee's termination of employment hereunder shall have occurred, by the
First Jersey National Bank, Jersey City, New Jersey, as applicable to its most
creditworthy customers' demand borrowings.

     Payment of the amount computed under this Paragraph 8(B) shall commence
with the month in which the Employee's termination of employment hereunder shall
occur, and shall continue to be made throughout 

                                                                               8

the remaining Period of Employment in equal installments at the times provided
for payment of fixed salary in Paragraph 4(A) hereof.

          (C) The employee shall be paid the amount, if any, of the "Projected
Thrift Plan Contribution" computed as follows:

          The Projected Thrift Plan Contribution is the cumulative amount of the
"Matching Employer Contributions" (as defined in the Thrift Plan at the date
first written above) that would have been contributed to the Thrift Plan on the
Employee's behalf had the Employee:

               (i)  continued in employment under this Agreement throughout the
                    Period of Employment remaining after the Employee's
                    termination of employment hereunder, and

               (ii) actually been credited under the Thrift Plan with Matching
                    Employer Contributions throughout such remaining Period of
                    Employment at the rate of 50% of the combined average
                    monthly "Basic Contributions" and "Salary Deferral
                    Contributions" (as such terms are defined in the Thrift Plan
                    at the date first written above) contributed by the Employee
                    to the Thrift Plan during the twelve (12) month period
                    ending with the last day of the month prior to the month in
                    which occurs the Employee's actual termination of employment
                    under this Agreement.

Payment of such amount shall commence with the month in which occurs the
Employee's termination of employment hereunder, and shall continue to be made
throughout the remaining Period of Employment in equal installments at the times
provided for the payment of fixed salary in Paragraph 4(A) hereof.

          (D) The Employee shall be paid the excess of:

               (i)  the actuarially determined present value of the vested
                    retirement benefit the Employee would have accrued under the
                    SRP had the Employee actually continued in full-time
                    employment and participated in the SRP throughout the Period
                    of Employment remaining after the Employee's termination of
                    employment hereunder, at the annual rate of compensation
                    specified in Paragraph 8(A) above, over

               (ii) the actuarially determined present value of the vested
                    retirement benefit actually accrued by the Employee under
                    the SRP, or that would have so accrued had the Employee
                    actually participated in the SRP, to the date of the
                    Employee's actual termination of employment hereunder.

                                                                               9

The amount provided under this Paragraph 8(D) shall be determined with reference
to the benefit formula of the SRP as in effect on the date first written above
and shall be computed (for purposes of determining a present value hereunder) as
a life annuity payable for the Employee's lifetime only, and deemed to commence
at the earliest date the Employee could elect to receive vested retirement
benefits under the SRP (or could have so elected had the Employee actually
participated in the SRP) after his termination of employment hereunder.  For
purposes of this Paragraph 8(D), at the time of the Employee's actual
termination of employment hereunder the Employee shall be deemed to be the older
of age 55 or the Employee's actual age at such time.  The actuarially determined
present value of the benefits payable under this Paragraph 8(D) shall be
determined by using a discount factor equal to one percentage point below the
interest rate last publicly announced, as of the date on which the Employee's
termination of employment hereunder shall have occurred, by the First Jersey
National Bank, Jersey City, New Jersey, as applicable to its most creditworthy
customers' demand borrowings.

     Payment of the amount computed under this Paragraph 8(D) shall commence
with the month in which the Employee's termination of employment hereunder shall
occur, and shall continue to be made throughout the remaining Period of
Employment in equal installments at the times provided for the payment of fixed
salary in Paragraph 4(A) hereof.

          (E) The Employee shall be paid the amount of "Projected Performance
Cash Awards" computed as follows:

          Projected Performance Cash Awards shall be the cumulative amount of
Performance Cash Awards that would have been awarded the employee under the MIP
had the Employee:

               (i)  continued in employment under this Agreement throughout the
                    Period of Employment remaining after the Employee's
                    termination of employment hereunder at an annual rate of
                    compensation equal to that specified in Paragraph 8(A)
                    above, and

               (ii) actually been awarded Performance Cash Awards under the MIP
                    throughout such remaining Period of Employment in amounts
                    computed at the percentage rate of Performance Cash Awards
                    last in effect for the Employee as of the date of the
                    Employee's termination of employment hereunder.

Payment of such amount shall commence with the month in which the Employee's
termination of employment hereunder shall occur, and shall continue to be made
throughout the remaining Period of Employment in equal installments at the times
provided for the payment of fixed salary in Paragraph 4(A) hereof.

          (F)  The Employee shall be paid an amount, if any, determined as
               follows:

                                                                              10
<PAGE>
 
          Upon the Employee's termination of employment hereunder the Employee
may elect to surrender all or any portion of the Employee's outstanding Stock
Options under the MIP, provided (i) such Stock Options were outstanding on the
date of the Employee's termination hereunder, and (ii) at least six months have
elapsed since the date of grant of the Stock Options to be surrendered, and
(iii) at least six months have elapsed since the date first written above.  The
Employee may make such election by delivering to the Company not later than the
30th day after the date of the Employee's termination of employment hereunder a
notice (the "Notice") specifying the Stock Options being surrendered and the
Employee's decision to surrender them in accordance with this Paragraph 8(F).
The Notice once delivered shall be irrevocable.  If the Employee so elects to
surrender Stock Options hereunder, the Company shall pay the Employee not later
than 45 days after delivery of the Notice an amount in immediately available
funds equal to the excess, if any, of (a) the "Highest Traded Price" (as defined
below) of the shares subject to the surrendered Stock Options, minus (ii) the
option price for such shares.  Upon full payment to the Employee of the amount
specified above, the Stock Options so surrendered by the Employee shall be
cancelled and all obligations of the Companies under the MIP or otherwise in
connection therewith shall be discharged.  For purposes of this Paragraph 8(F)
"Highest Traded Price" means the highest closing price per share of Company
stock based upon composite transactions reported from all national securities
exchanges on the date of the Employee's termination hereunder, or, if the
Company's stock is not so traded on that date, the first day preceding that date
on which the Company's stock is so traded.

          (G) In addition, in the event of any termination of employment by the
Employee pursuant to Paragraph 7(C) above, or in the event the Employee's
employment under this Agreement is terminated by the Company or any of its
subsidiaries or affiliates for any reason other than the Employee's death, total
and permanent disability or one of those reasons specified in Paragraph 7(A) or
7(B) above, the Companies shall, subject to the provisions of Paragraph 8(I)
below, ensure that the Employee shall continue, throughout the Period of
Employment remaining after the Employee's termination of employment hereunder,
to be entitled to all benefits listed in subparts (f), (g) and (h) of Paragraph
4(B) of this Agreement, as if the Employee were still employed under this
Agreement during such period.  Such benefits will based upon the Employee's
fixed salary for the remaining Period of Employment as computed under Paragraph
8(A) above.  If and to the extent such benefits shall not be payable or provided
under the group plans and programs so listed above, the Companies shall pay or
provide for payment of such benefits on an individual basis.  The benefits
described in subpart (h) of Paragraph 4(B) hereof, as provided the Employee
under this Paragraph 8(G), shall be secondary to any comparable benefits
provided the Employee by another person or company.

                                                                              11
<PAGE>
 
          (H) Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, in the
event:  (i)  the Employee's termination of employment shall occur prior to the
expiration of the Period of Employment and during the twenty-four (24) month
period commencing on the occurrence, if any, of a Change in Control (as defined
in Paragraph 9 of this Agreement), and (ii) such termination was effected by the
Employee pursuant to Paragraph 7(C) above, or by the Company or any of its
subsidiaries or affiliates for any reason other than the Employee's death, total
and permanent disability or one of those reasons specified in Paragraph 7(A) or
7(B) above, the Employee shall be paid, no later than fifteen (15) business days
after such termination, a lump sum cash amount equal to the actuarially
determined present value of the sum of all amounts otherwise payable to the
Employee pursuant to Paragraphs 8(A) through (E) above, determined by using a
discount factor equal to one percentage point below the interest rate last
publicly announced, as of the date on which such termination of employment shall
have occurred, by the First Jersey National Bank, Jersey City, New Jersey, as
applicable to its most creditworthy customers' demand borrowings.

          (I) Payments and benefits provided the Employee under this Paragraph 8
shall be reduced to the extent the Employee receives, or would receive but for
any deferral of same, payments or benefits corresponding to those provided in
this Paragraph 8, or other payments or benefits, for services rendered to
another person or company during the period upon which the payments and benefits
provided under this Paragraph 8 are based.  The Employee agrees to make an
appropriate refund, without interest, to the Companies in the amounts expended
by the Companies to provide payments and benefits under this Paragraph 8 to the
extent the Employee receives, or would receive but for any deferral, payments or
benefits corresponding to those provided under this Paragraph 8 from another
person or company.  This Paragraph 8(I) shall be interpreted to prevent the
Employee's receipt of duplicative payments or benefits under this Paragraph 8
and from other sources.

     9.   Payments upon the Occurrence of a Change in Control.  As used in this
          ---------------------------------------------------                  
          Agreement, "Change in Control" means the happening of any of the
          following:

               (a)  the acquisition by any party or group of the beneficial
                    ownership of 20% or more of the voting shares of the
                    Company, or

               (b)  the occurrence of a transaction requiring shareholder
                    approval for the acquisition of the Company through purchase
                    or exchange of stock or assets, or by merger, or otherwise,
                    or

               (c)  the election during a period of 12 months or less, of one
                    third (1/3) or more of the members of the Board, without the
                    approval of a majority of the Board as constituted at the
                    beginning of such period.

                                                                              12
<PAGE>
 
     In the event a Change in Control occurs (i) prior to the Employee's actual
termination of employment hereunder, or (ii) after the Employee's actual
termination of employment hereunder and prior to the expiration of the Period of
Employment (provided, however, that a termination of employment under this
subpart (ii) was effected by the Employee pursuant to Paragraph 7(C) above, or
by the Company or any of its subsidiaries or affiliates for any reason other
than the Employee's death, total and permanent disability or one of those
reasons specified in Paragraph 7(A) or 7(B) above) the Companies shall pay the
Employee (or, in the event of the Employee's death after the Change in Control
but prior to the time payment hereunder is made, the Employee's estate) within
fifteen (15) business days after the occurrence of such Change in Control (or,
in the case of payments required under Paragraph 9(C) hereof, at such later time
as may be specified in such Paragraph), a single lump sum amount in immediately
available funds equaling the sum of the amounts described in Subparagraphs (A)
through (D), below:

          (A) The actuarially determined present value of the vested retirement
benefit accrued by the Employee under the SRP, or that would have so accrued had
the Employee actually participated in the SRP, determined as if the Employee's
employment hereunder had terminated on the date of the Change in Control.  The
amount provided under this Subparagraph shall be determined with reference to
the benefit formula of the SRP as in effect on the date first written above, and
shall be computed (for purposes of determining a present value hereunder) as a
life annuity payable for the Employee's lifetime only, and deemed to commence at
the earliest date after the Change in Control the Employee could elect to
receive vested retirement benefits under the SRP (or could have so elected had
the Employee actually participated in the SRP) had his employment hereunder
terminated on the date of the Change in Control.  For purposes of this Paragraph
9(A), at the time of a Change in Control, the Employee shall be deemed to be the
older of age 55 or the Employee's actual age at such time.  The actuarially
determined present value of the benefit payable under this Paragraph 9(A) shall
be determined by using a discount factor equal to one percentage point below the
interest rate last publicly announced, as of the date on which the change in
Control shall have occurred, by the First Jersey National Bank, Jersey City, New
Jersey, as applicable to its most creditworthy customers' demand borrowings.

          (B) the amount of all "Performance Cash Awards" (as defined in the
MIP) awarded the Employee under MIP but not yet paid by the Company at the time
the Change in Control occurs.

          (C) An amount attributable to surrendered "Stock Options", if any,
under the MIP, determined as follows:  Upon the occurrence of a Change in
Control hereunder the Employee may elect to surrender all or any portion of the
Employee's outstanding Stock Options under the MIP, provided (i) such Stock
Options were outstanding on the date of the Change in Control, and (ii) at least
six months have elapsed since the date of grant of the Stock Options to be
surrendered, and (iii) at least six months have elapsed since

                                                                              13
<PAGE>
 
the date first written above. The Employee may make such election by delivering
to the Company not later than the 30th day after the date of the Change in
Control a notice (the "Notice") specifying the Stock Options being surrendered
and the Employee's decision to surrender them in accordance with this Paragraph
9(C). The Employee may elect to surrender such Stock Options regardless of
whether the Employee has been continuously employed by one or more of the
Companies on and after the date of the Change in Control. The Notice once
delivered shall be irrevocable. If the Employee so elects to surrender Stock
Options hereunder, the Companies shall pay the employee not later than 45 days
after delivery of the Notice an amount in immediately available funds equal to
the excess, if any, of (i) the "Current Market Value" (as defined below) of the
share subject to the surrendered Stock Options, minus (ii) the option price for
such shares. Upon full payment to the Employee of the amount specified above,
the Stock Options so surrendered by the Employee shall be cancelled and all
obligations of the Companies under the MIP or otherwise in connection therewith
shall be discharged. For purposes of this Paragraph 9(C), "Current Market Value"
means the highest "Closing Price" (as defined below) during the period
commencing thirty (30) days prior to the Change in Control and ending thirty
(30) days after the Change in Control (the "Reference Period"); provided,
however, that if a Change in Control occurs as a result of a tender offer or
exchange offer, or a merger, purchase of assets or stock or other transaction
approved by shareholders of the Company, "Current Market Value" means the higher
of (i) the highest Closing Price during the Reference Period, or (ii) the
highest price paid per share of Company stock pursuant to such tender offer,
exchange offer or transaction. The "Closing Price" on any day during the
Reference Period means the closing price per share of Company stock based upon
composite transactions reported from all national securities exchanges on that
day.

          (D) The amount, if any, of the Employee's outstanding deferrals
(through the date of the Change in Control) of salary, Performance Cash Awards
under the MIP or other amounts under any plan or program of one or more of the
Companies that permits or permitted such deferrals and in which only highly
compensated employees of the Company or its subsidiaries or affiliates are or
were eligible to participate (the "Elective Deferrals").  The Elective Deferrals
shall include earnings, if any, on amounts so deferred to the extent provided,
if at all, under the applicable provisions of any such plan or program.  The
Elective Deferrals shall not include any amounts described herein that are
actually paid on the Employee's behalf prior to the Change in Control.
Notwithstanding the provisions of any such plan or program, any amount of
Elective Deferrals that may actually become payable on the Employee's behalf
under such plan or program shall be reduced by any amount paid for the same
period of employment under this Subparagraph.

     10.  Offsets.  To the extent the Employee shall receive amounts payable
          -------                                                           
under Paragraph 8 of this Agreement, equivalent amounts also payable under
Paragraph 9 of this Agreement and attributable to the same 

                                                                              14
<PAGE>
 
period or periods of the Employee's employment with the Companies shall be
correspondingly reduced, and vice versa. In addition, any amounts otherwise
payable under Paragraphs 8 and 9 of this Agreement will be reduced to the extent
equivalent amounts attributable to the same period or periods of the Employee's
employment with the Companies are actually provided under any of the plans or
programs described in Paragraphs 4 and 6 above or otherwise maintained or
sponsored by the Companies.

     11.  Source of Payments.  All payments provided under Paragraphs 4, 5, 8, 9
          ------------------                                                    
and 12 herein shall be paid from the general funds of the Companies unless
otherwise properly payable under any contract, trust or other arrangement
maintained by one or more of the Companies for purposes of such payment.  The
Companies shall not be required to segregate any funds, create any trust or make
any special deposits to fund any obligations under this Agreement provided,
however, that the Companies, at their sole and absolute discretion, may take any
steps they deem appropriate to meet their obligations hereunder.

     12.  Litigation Expenses.  In the event of any litigation or other
          -------------------                                          
proceeding between one or more of the Companies and the Employee with respect to
the subject matter of this Agreement and the enforcement of rights hereunder,
the companies shall reimburse the Employee for all reasonable costs and expenses
relating to such litigation or other proceeding, including reasonable attorneys'
fees and expenses, provided that such litigation or proceeding results in any

               (i)  settlement requiring one or more of the Companies to make a
                    payment to the Employee, or

               (ii) judgment, order, finding, award, determination or other
                    resolution in favor of the Employee, regardless of whether
                    such result is subsequently reversed on appeal or in a
                    collateral proceeding.

In no event shall the Employee be required to reimburse any of the Companies for
any of the costs and expenses relating to such litigation or other proceeding.
The obligation of the Companies under this Paragraph 12 shall survive the
termination or cancellation for any reason of this Agreement (whether such
termination is by the Companies, by the Employee, upon the expiration of this
Agreement or otherwise).

     13.  Tax Withholding.  The Companies may deduct and withhold from any
          ---------------                                                 
amounts which they are otherwise obligated to pay hereunder any amount which
they may determine they are required to deduct or withhold pursuant to any
applicable statute, law, regulation or order of any jurisdiction whatsoever.

     14.  Entire Understanding.  This Agreement contains the entire
          --------------------                                     
understanding between the Companies and the Employee with respect to the subject
matter hereof and supersedes any prior employment agreement between or among one
or more of the Companies and the Employee, except that this Agreement 

                                                                              15
<PAGE>
 
shall not affect or operate to reduce any benefit or compensation inuring to the
Employee of a kind elsewhere provided and not expressly discussed in this
Agreement.

     15.  Severability.  If, for any reason, any one or more of the provisions
          ------------                                                        
or part of a provision contained in this Agreement shall be judicially held to
be invalid, illegal or unenforceable in any respect, such invalidity, illegality
or unenforceability shall not affect any other provision or part of a provision
of this Agreement not held so invalid, illegal or unenforceable, and each other
provision or part of a provision shall to the full extent consistent with law
continue in full force and effect.

     16.  Notices.  All notices, requests, demands and other communications
          -------

     If at any time during the Period of Employment, the Employer fails, without

     if at any time during the Period of Employment, Employee shall fail to be

     notice, in which event the Period of Employment, as hereinafter defined,
     shall so terminate on the last day of such month; termination under these
     circumstances shall be deemed pursuant to Section 3.1 hereof as a

     disclosed or is not otherwise in the public domain, except as required by
     law or pursuant to legal process.

                                                                               2

     Agreement, or conflict in any material way with the business of Employer
     and the parent company and subsidiaries of Employer.  Employer acknowledges

     (b)  If Employee should terminate the Period of Employment pursuant to
          Section 3.2(a) above or Employer should terminate the Period of
          Employment for Cause, as herein defined, Employee will be entitled to
