PART III

On November 14, 1994, the Registrant entered into an Agreement and Plan of
Merger ("Agreement") with United/Harvey Holdings, L.P. ("Purchaser"), in which
the Purchaser agreed to acquire all the shares of the issued and outstanding
Common Stock of the Registrant. As a result of the additional time demands on
the Registrant's legal, and finance and accounting staffs in the due diligence
process related to the Agreement, the Registrant has been unable to assemble all
data required for Form 10-K in sufficient time to allow for review by its
directors.

Further, the same personnel responsible for Form 10-K preparation has been
attempting to deal with the additional workload generated by EDGAR submission
requirements.

The Registrant will undertake to file Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended
September 30, 1994 with the Commission not later than January 13, 1995.
