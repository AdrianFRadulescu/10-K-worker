ITEM 1 - BUSINESS
West One Bancorp, (the Registrant) is an Idaho corporation formed in 1981 as
a bank holding company subject to regulation under the Bank Holding Company Act
of 1956, as amended, and is registered with the Board of Governors of the
Federal Reserve System (Federal Reserve Board). 

The Registrant's principal subsidiary is West One Bank, Idaho in Boise, Idaho. 
Other subsidiaries include West One Bank, Washington in Seattle, Washington;

Oregon; West One Bank, Oregon, S.B. in Hillsboro, Oregon; Idaho First Bank in
Boise, Idaho; West One Financial Services, Inc. in Boise, Idaho; West One Trust
Company in Salt Lake City, Utah; West One Trust Company, Washington in
Bellevue, Washington; and West One Life Insurance Company in Boise, Idaho. 

The Registrant, through its subsidiaries, provides a wide variety of financial
services to corporate and institutional customers, governments, individuals,
and other financial institutions.  Such services include domestic commercial
banking, investment and funds management, personal banking, trust operations,
corporate services, mortgage banking and credit life insurance.  As of December

WEST ONE BANK, IDAHO
West One Bank, Idaho (West One, Idaho) was founded in 1867 in Boise, Idaho, and
was the second national bank to be established west of the Rocky Mountains. 
When branch banking was authorized in 1933, West One, Idaho acquired three
affiliated banks, thus beginning the development of its present statewide
banking organization in Idaho.

West One, Idaho is an Idaho-chartered bank supervised and regulated at the 
state level by the Director of the Idaho Department of Finance and at the 
federal level by the Federal Reserve Board.  West One, Idaho is insured by 
the Bank Insurance Fund (BIF) and is therefore also subject to regulations 
issued by the FDIC.  (See "Supervision and Regulation - Other Regulations.")

On January 21, 1994, West One, Idaho acquired Idaho State Bank with assets of
$48 million in exchange for 133,332 shares of the Registrant's common stock.
The transaction is a pooling of interests in 1994.  Idaho State Bank's
financial position and results of operations are not material to West One's
financial position and results of operations.
                                     
Idaho is the primary market area of West One, Idaho.  West One, Idaho offers
a full range of commercial and personal banking and trust services.  Its
corporate banking department provides a broad range of customized credit
products and services to middle market and large corporate borrowers.  The
principal industries in Idaho include agriculture, forest products, services,
tourism, mining and manufacturing.

The banking business in Idaho is highly competitive.  West One, Idaho competes
for deposits, loans,  and trust accounts with other banks and financial
institutions.  At December 31, 1993, West One had $3.9 billion in assets and
79 branches.  Based on assets of $3.8 billion at September 30, 1993, West One,
Idaho is the largest bank in Idaho.  In 1993, approximately 20 banks with
approximately 306 branches were actively engaged in banking in Idaho.

and permit faster processing of customer transactions.

SUPERVISION AND REGULATION
The Registrant's banking subsidiaries are affected by the policies of
regulatory authorities, including the monetary policy of the Federal Reserve
Board.  In order to mitigate recessionary and inflationary pressures, the
Federal Reserve Board uses a variety of money supply management techniques,
including engaging in open market operations in United States Government
securities, changing the discount rate on member bank borrowings, and changing
reserve requirements against member bank deposits.  The impact of current
economic conditions on the policies of the Federal Reserve Board and other

                                      -5-
<PAGE>
<PAGE>
regulatory authorities and their effect on the future business and earnins of
the Registrant cannnot be predicted with assurance.

The Registrant is subject to regulation under the Bank Holding Company Act of
1956, as amended.  Under that Act, the Registrant is required to obtain the
approval of the Federal Reserve Board before it may acquire all or
substantially all of the assets of any bank or ownership or control of any
voting securities of any bank not already majority owned if, after giving
effect to the acquisition, the Registrant would own or control more than five
percent of the voting shares of such bank.

The Bank Holding Company Act of 1956 generally does not permit the Federal
Reserve Board to approve an acquisition by a bank holding company of voting
shares or assets of a bank located outside the state in which the operations
of its banking subsidiaries are principally conducted unless the acquisition
is specifically authorized by the statutes of the states in which the banks are
located.  Each of the states in the Registrant's marketing area have adopted
legislation that permits bank acquisition by out-of-state bank holding
companies, with certain restrictions.  

The Bank Holding Company Act of 1956 also prohibits, with certain exceptions,
the Registrant from engaging in or acquiring direct or indirect control of more
than five percent of the voting shares of any company engaged in nonbanking
activities.  One of the principal exceptions to this prohibition applies to
activities found by the Federal Reserve Board to be so closely related to
banking as to be a proper incident thereto.  Some of the activities which the
Federal Reserve Board has determined by regulation to be closely related to
banking are:  mortgage banking, certain data processing operations, personal
property leasing on a full payout basis and operation of a consumer finance
business.  The Registrant is not subject to territorial restrictions on the
operations of nonbank subsidiaries.

The Registrant and its subsidiaries are prohibited from engaging in certain
"tie-in" arrangements in connection with extensions of credit or provision of
any property or service.  Also, the Registrant's banking subsidiaries are
subject to restrictions on loans to the Registrant or its subsidiaries,
investments in stock or other securities of the Registrant or its subsidiaries,
or advances to any borrower collateralized by such stock or other securities.

In December 1991, Congress enacted the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation
Improvement Act of 1991 ("FDICIA"), which substantially revises the bank
regulatory and funding provisions of the Federal Deposit Insurance Act and
makes revisions to several other federal banking statutes.

In addition to establishing minimum capital requirements, FDICIA directs that
each federal banking agency prescribe standards for depository institutions and
depository institution holding companies relating to internal controls,
information systems, internal audit systems, loan documentation, credit
underwriting, interest rate exposure, asset growth, compensation, a maximum
ratio of classified assets to capital and such other standards as the agency 
deems appropriate. 

FDICIA also contains a variety of other provisions that may affect the
operations of the Registrant including new reporting requirements, revised
regulatory standards for real estate lending, "truth in savings" provisions,
and the requirement that a depository institution give 90 days' notice to
customers and regulatory authorities before closing any branch.

A loan or lease is placed on nonaccrual status when timely collection of
interest becomes doubtful.  Interest payments received on nonaccrual loans and
leases are applied to principal if collection of principal is doubtful or
reflected as interest income on a cash basis.  Loans and leases are removed
from nonaccrual status when they are current and collectibility of principal
and interest is no longer doubtful.

Income foregone on nonaccrual and restructured loans, net of tax, was
$1,086,000, $1,650,000 and $3,662,000 for the years ended December 31, 1993,
1992 and 1991, respectively.

                          ARTICLES OF INCORPORATION

                                     OF

                               WEST ONE BANCORP

   The undersigned, acting as incorporator under the Idaho Business Corporation
Act, adopts the following Articles of Incorporation:

                                   ARTICLE I

   The name of the corporation is West One Bancorp and its duration shall be
perpetual.

                                   ARTICLE II

   The purpose or purposes for which the corporation is organized are:

   a.  To engage in the business of acquiring, holding and disposing of shares
of, and controlling and managing, financial institutions including, without
limitation, banks, trust companies, mortgage companies, insurance companies,
savings and loan associations and finance companies.

   b.  To engage in the transaction of any or all lawful business for which
corporations may be organized under the Idaho Business Corporation Act.

                                   ARTICLE III

   The aggregate number of shares which the corporation shall have authority
to issue is 80,000,000, of which 5,000,000 shares shall be Cumulative Preferred
Stock, $1 par value, issuable in series, and 75,000,000 shares shall be Common
Stock, $1 par value.  The preferences, limitations and relative rights of each
class of such shares shall be as follows:

   Section A.  Cumulative Preferred Stock

   This Section A sets forth a description of the Cumulative Preferred Stock
and a statement of certain of the preferences, limitations and relative rights
in respect of the shares of the Cumulative Preferred Stock, together with a
statement of the authority vested in the board of directors of the corporation
to divide the Cumulative Preferred Stock into series, and to fix and determine
the relative rights and preferences of the shares of any series insofar as they
are not fixed herein.

   Subsection 1.   Dividends on Cumulative Preferred Stock and Junior Stock

   The holders of the Cumulative Preferred Stock shall be entitled to receive,
when and as declared by the board of directors out of assets of the corporation
legally available for dividends, cumulative cash dividends at, but not
exceeding, the annual rate fixed for each particular series, payable quarterly
on the fifteenth day of January, April, July and October in each year.  Such
dividends on the Cumulative Preferred Stock shall be payable before any
dividend on any junior stock (which term shall mean the Common Stock of the
corporation and any other class of stock of the corporation hereafter
authorized ranking junior to the Cumulative Preferred Stock as to dividends or
assets) shall be paid or set apart for payment.  Dividends on each series of
the Cumulative Preferred Stock shall be cumulative from such date as may be
fixed for such series prior to the issue thereof.  Arrearages in the payment
of dividends shall not bear interest.

   In case dividends are not paid in full, the shares of all series of the
Cumulative Preferred Stock shall share ratably in the payment of dividends,
including accruals, if any, in proportion to the sums which would be payable
on said shares if all dividends were declared and paid in full.

   As long as any of the Cumulative Preferred Stock remains outstanding, no
dividend whatever shall be paid or declared on any junior stock, nor shall any
distribution be made on any junior stock, other than a dividend payable in
junior stock, nor shall any shares of any junior stock be acquired for a
consideration by the corporation unless:

   a.      All dividends on the Cumulative Preferred Stock of all series for
all past quarterly dividend periods shall have been paid and the full dividends
thereon for the then current quarterly dividend period shall have been paid or
shall have been declared and a sum sufficient for the payment thereof set
apart; and

   b.  All amounts, if any, then or theretofore required to be paid or set
apart for the redemption or purchase of the Cumulative Preferred Stock of all
series (pursuant to any applicable sinking fund or redemption provision or
otherwise) shall have been paid or set apart.

   Subject to the foregoing provisions, and not otherwise, such dividends
(payable in cash, stock or otherwise) as may be determined by the board of
directors may be declared and paid on any junior stock from time to time out
of the remaining funds of the corporation legally available for the payment of
dividends, and the Cumulative Preferred Stock shall not be entitled to
participate in any such dividends, whether payable in cash, stock or otherwise.

   Subsection 2.  Redemption

   Subject to the provisions of each particular series respecting redemption
of such series, the corporation, at the option of the board of directors, may
redeem the whole or any part of the Cumulative Preferred Stock at any time
outstanding, or the whole or any part of any series thereof, at any time or
from time to time at the applicable redemption price or prices, together with
an amount equal to the dividends accrued thereon to the date of redemption.

   In case of redemption of a part only of any series of the Cumulative
Preferred Stock at the time outstanding, the redemption may be either pro rata
or by lot.  The board of directors shall have full power and authority to
prescribe the manner in which the drawings by lot or the pro rata redemption
shall be conducted and, subject to the provisions herein contained, the terms
and conditions upon which the Cumulative Preferred Stock shall be redeemed from
time to time.

   Notice of any redemption of Cumulative Preferred Stock shall be given by the
corporation by mailing a copy of such notice at least 30 days prior to the date
fixed for such redemption to the holders of record of the Cumulative Preferred
Stock to be redeemed at their respective addresses appearing on the books of
the corporation, and the time of mailing such notice shall be deemed to be the
time of delivery thereof.

   At any time after notice of redemption has been so given, the corporation
may, on a date specified in the notice of redemption, deposit with a bank or
trust company, named in such notice, doing business in Boise, Idaho, or in New
York, New York, and having capital, surplus and undivided profits of at least
$5,000,000, a sum sufficient to redeem the shares to be redeemed with
irrevocable instruction and authority to pay the redemption price to the
holders of such shares upon surrender of certificates therefor.  Upon such
deposit, or, if no such deposit is made, upon the date of redemption (unless
the corporation shall default in payment of the moneys necessary for such
redemption), all shares with respect to which such notice of redemption was
given shall cease to be outstanding for any purpose, whether or not the
certificates for such shares shall have been surrendered for cancellation, and
all rights with respect to such shares shall thereupon cease and terminate,
except the right of the holders of the certificates for such shares to receive
the amount payable upon the redemption thereof, without interest, from said
bank or trust company, or from the corporation, if no such deposit is made, and
the right to exercise, on or before the date of redemption, any unexpired
privilege of conversion.

   Any funds so deposited by the corporation which shall not be required for
such redemption because of the exercise of any privilege of conversion
subsequent to the time of such deposit shall be returned to the corporation
forthwith.  Any interest on funds so deposited shall belong to the corporation
and shall be paid to it from time to time.

   Subsection 3.   Amounts Payable on Liquidation or Dissolution

   In the event of any liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the
corporation, whether voluntary or involuntary, the holders of the Cumulative
Preferred Stock of each series then outstanding shall be entitled to receive
in cash out of the assets of the corporation, before any distribution or
payment shall be made to the holders of any junior stock, the full preferential
amount or amounts fixed for such series, plus in respect of each such share an
amount equal to the dividends accrued thereon to the date fixed for such
payment; provided that, if such assets available for the holders of the
Cumulative Preferred Stock of each series then outstanding shall be less than
the total amount all such holders would be so entitled to receive if all such
preferential amount or amounts and dividends were paid in full, then the
corporation shall, in lieu of making such payments in full to the holders of
the Cumulative Preferred Stock of each series then outstanding, make payments
to the holders of the Cumulative Preferred Stock of each series then
outstanding (in proportion to the respective amounts which would be payable on
account of such liquidation dissolution or winding up if all such payments were
paid in full) of an aggregate amount equal to such assets so available.  If
such payment shall have been made in full to the holders of the Cumulative
Preferred Stock on voluntary or involuntary liquidation, dissolution or winding
up (or deposited to their accounts in a bank or trust company doing business
in Boise, Idaho, or New York, New York, and having capital, surplus and
undivided profits of at least $5,000,000 so as to be, and continue to be,
available for such holders), the remaining assets of the corporation shall be
distributed among the holders of junior stock, according to their respective
rights and preferences and in accordance with their respective holdings.  For
the purposes of this Subsection 3, a consolidation or merger of the corporation
with any other corporation shall not be deemed, as such, to constitute a
liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the corporation, but any reorga-
nization of the corporation required by any court or administrative body in
order to comply with any provision of law shall be deemed to be an involuntary
liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the corporation unless the
preferences, limitations and relative rights in respect of the Cumulative
Preferred Stock are not adversely affected by such reorganization.

   Subsection 4.  Restrictions on Corporate Action

   The consent of the holders of at least a majority of the Cumulative
Preferred Stock at the time outstanding, given in person or by proxy, either
in writing or at a meeting at which the Cumulative Preferred Stock shall vote
separately as a class, regardless of series, shall be necessary to effect or
validate any one or more of the following:

   a.  The authorization of any class of stock of the corporation ranking prior
to or on a parity with the Cumulative Preferred Stock as to dividends or in
liquidation, or any increase in the authorized amount of the Cumulative
Preferred Stock, or

   b.  The amendment, alteration or repeal of any of the provisions hereof
which have reference to the Cumulative Preferred Stock so as to materially and
adversely affect the rights or preferences of the Cumulative Preferred Stock;
provided, however, that no such consent shall be required in connection with
any reduction of the authorized amount of Cumulative Preferred Stock resulting
from a redemption, purchase, exercise of a conversion privilege or other
acquisition of Cumulative Preferred Stock by the corporation.

   Subsection 5.   Status of Redeemed, Purchased and Converted Shares

   Except as otherwise required by law, all shares of the Cumulative Preferred
Stock redeemed, purchased, converted into other shares of the corporation, or
otherwise acquired by the corporation, shall be retired and shall not be
reissued.  The corporation may, from time to time, take such appropriate
corporate action as may be necessary to reduce the authorized amount of the
Cumulative Preferred Stock accordingly.

   Subsection 6.  Sinking Funds

   If in any case the amounts payable with respect to any requirements to
retire shares of the Cumulative Preferred Stock are not paid in full with
respect to all series for which such requirements exist, the number of shares
to be retired in each series shall be in proportion to the respective amounts
which would be payable on account of such requirements if all amounts payable
were paid in full.

   Subsection 7.  Issuance in Series

   The Cumulative Preferred Stock may, from time to time, be divided into and
issued in series.  All shares of the Cumulative Preferred Stock, regardless of
series, shall be identical with each other in all respects, except that each
series shall be distinctively designated and except as to the following
relative rights and preferences as to which there may be variations between the
different series:

   a.  The rate of dividend and the date from which dividends shall commence
to accrue.

   b.  The price at and the terms and conditions on which shares may be
redeemed, which may include a redemption price or scale of redemption prices
applicable only to redemption for a sinking fund (which term shall include any
fund or requirement for the periodic retirement of shares) and a different
redemption price or scale of redemption prices applicable to any other
redemption.

   c.  The amount payable upon shares in the event of the voluntary or
involuntary liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the corporation.  Such
amount shall not be more than the par value of the shares plus any additional
amount of surplus transferred or to be transferred to stated capital in respect
of the shares upon the issuance thereof.

   d.  Sinking fund provisions, if any, for the redemption or purchase of
shares.

   e.  The terms and conditions, if any, on which shares may be converted.

   f.  Voting rights, if any, in addition to the rights provided in Subsection
4 of this Section A.

   The board of directors is hereby expressly vested with authority to divide
the Cumulative Preferred Stock into series and, within the limitations herein
and by law provided, by resolution prior to the issue of any shares of a
series, to distinctively designate the series and to fix and determine the
relative rights and preferences of the shares of any series so established.

   Section B.  Common Stock

   Except for and subject to those rights expressly granted in Section A of
this Article III to the holders of the Cumulative Preferred Stock, or except
as may be provided by law, the holders of the Common Stock shall have all other
rights of shareholders, including, but not by way of limitation: (1) voting
power for all purposes and the right to all notices of meetings or of other
corporate actions, (2) the right to receive dividends when and as declared by
the board of directors out of assets legally available therefor, and (3) in the
event of any distribution of assets upon liquidation, dissolution or winding
up of the corporation or otherwise, the right to receive all the assets of the
corporation remaining after payment to the holders of the Cumulative Preferred
Stock of the specific amounts which they are entitled to receive upon such
liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the corporation, as provided in Sec-
tion A of this Article III.

                                  ARTICLE IV

   No shareholder of the corporation shall, by reason of his holding shares of
any class, have any preemptive or preferential rights to purchase or subscribe
to any shares of the corporation now or hereafter to be authorized, or any
other securities convertible into or carrying a right to subscribe to or
acquire shares of any class now or hereafter to be authorized (whether or not
the issuance of any such shares or other securities would adversely affect the
dividend or voting rights of such shareholder) other than such rights, if any,
as the board of directors in its discretion from time to time may grant and at
such price as the board of directors may fix; and the corporation may issue
unissued or treasury shares or any other securities convertible into or carry-
ing rights to subscribe to or acquire shares without offering any such shares
or other securities, either in whole or in part, to the existing shareholders.

                                   ARTICLE V

   Subject to the provisions of Article III, the corporation may purchase its
own shares to the extent of unreserved and unrestricted capital surplus
available therefor without a vote of the shareholders of the corporation upon
such terms and conditions as may be fixed by the board of directors of the
corporation.

                                   ARTICLE VI

   Subject to the provisions of Article III, the board of directors may from
time to time within the limitations herein and by law provided, but without a
vote of the shareholders, distribute to the holders of any class of shares of
the corporation out of its capital surplus, a portion of its assets, in cash
or property; provided that (i) no such distribution shall be made at a time
when the corporation is insolvent or when such distribution would render the
corporation insolvent, (ii) no such distribution shall be made to the holders
of any class of shares unless all cumulative dividends accrued on all preferred
or special classes of shares entitled to preferential dividends shall have been
fully paid, and (iii) no such distribution shall be made to the holders of any
class of shares which would reduce the remaining net assets of the corporation
below the aggregate preferential amount payable in event of involuntary
liquidation to the holders of shares having preferential rights to the assets
of the corporation in the event of liquidation.

                                  ARTICLE VII

   Each person who at any time is or shall have been a director or officer of
the corporation, including any director or officer who is or shall have been
serving at the request of the corporation as a director, officer, employee or
agent of another corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust or other enter-
prise, and his heirs, executors and administrators, shall be indemnified by the
corporation against expenses (including attorney's fees), judgments, fines and
amounts paid in settlement incurred by him in any such capacity or arising out
of his status as such, all in accordance with and to the full extent permitted
by the Idaho Business Corporation Act as in effect at the time of the adoption
of this Article or as amended from time to time.  The foregoing right of
indemnification shall not be deemed a limitation on the power of the
corporation to indemnify any director, officer, employee, agent or other person
and shall not be deemed exclusive of other rights to which any such person may
be entitled in any capacity as a matter of law or under any bylaw, agreement,
vote of shareholders or directors, or otherwise.  The corporation may, to the
full extent permitted by the Idaho Business Corporation Act as in effect at the
time of the adoption of this Article or as amended from time to time, purchase
and maintain insurance on behalf of any person who is or was a director,
officer, employee or agent of the corporation, or is or was serving at the
request of the corporation as a director, officer, employee or agent of another
corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust or other enterprise against any
liability asserted against him and incurred by him in any such capacity or
arising out of his status as such, whether or not the corporation would have
the power to indemnify him against such liability.

                                   ARTICLE VIII

   No person shall be eligible to serve on the board of directors who, on or
before the date of the next annual meeting of shareholders, shall have attained
the age of 70 years; provided that a director who attains the age of 70 years
may continue as a director until the next such annual meeting following his
70th birthday unless sooner removed from office as provided in the bylaws of
the corporation.

                                    ARTICLE IX

   The number of directors of the corporation shall be as fixed by the bylaws
of the corporation but shall be not less than nine.  The directors shall be
divided into three classes designated Class I, Class II and Class III, each
class to be as nearly equal in number as possible.  The term of office of Class
I directors shall expire at the annual meeting of shareholders in 1986, that
of Class II directors at the annual meeting of shareholders in 1987 and that
of Class III directors at the annual meeting of shareholders in 1988.  At each
annual meeting of shareholders beginning in 1986, the number of directors equal

                     EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION PROGRAM



   The Registrant's overall approach to executive compensation is based on a
philosophy that combines a goal-driven annual cash compensation package with
equity incentives designed to build stock ownership among key employees.  These
two key principles serve to align executives effectively with shareholder
interests by focusing management on financial goals needed to secure
shareholder value, as well as steady long-term growth, by strongly encouraging
significant ownership in the Registrant's stock.

   The Registrant maintains a competitive salary structure, each year salaries
for executive officers are reviewed against market information assembled by
consultants.  The objective is to maintain salaries at a level which is
equivalent to that of banks of comparable size nationwide.  Adjustments to
competitive rates are then considered based on the Compensation Committee's
overall assessment of the Registrant's performance and of each executive's
individual contribution and achievement of objectives.

   The Executive Incentive Bonus Plan rewards participants for the achievement
of corporate, subsidiary, business unit, and individual goals.  Goals based on
return on assets, return on equity, and net income are set at the beginning of
each year in the context of a long-term planning process and a review of peer
banks with asset sizes comparable to that of the Registrant and its major
banking subsidiaries.

MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF
OPERATIONS

Management's discussion and analysis of West One Bancorp and subsidiaries (the
Corporation) supplements the accompanying consolidated financial statements. 
Prior year information has been restated to reflect a two-for-one stock split
effected by means of a stock dividend paid in August 1993.  

PERFORMANCE OVERVIEW

Net income was $83.2 million in 1993, a 31% increase over the Corporation's
previous record earnings of $63.4 million in 1992. Net income in 1992 was 54%
higher than the $41.2 million earned in 1991.  Loan growth, a higher net
interest margin and lower credit related costs contributed to the earnings
improvement in 1993 and 1992.  Fully diluted earnings per share increased 20%
to $2.38 in 1993 following an increase of 38% in 1992.  The Corporation's five-
year compound growth rate for net income was 25% and fully diluted earnings per
share increased at a compound annual growth rate of 19% over the same period. 

The Corporation's return on average assets was 1.14% in 1993, an improvement
from returns of 1.08% and .80% in 1992 and 1991, respectively.  Return on
average shareholders' equity was 15.61% in 1993, up from 14.93% in 1992 and
11.82% in 1991. 

Expansion in the state of Washington contributed to the Corporation's
performance in 1993.  In September 1992, the Corporation acquired 38 branches
with deposits of $1.2 billion and loans of $837 million from Security Pacific
Corporation (the Washington Acquisition).   The Corporation further improved
its competitive position in Washington by acquiring Yakima Valley Bank, a four-
branch institution with assets of $119 million, in October 1992,and Ben
Franklin National Bank, a three-branch institution with assets of $37 million,
in May 1993.

REGIONAL ECONOMIC PERFORMANCE

A financial institution's performance is directly influenced by economic
conditions in its service area.  In 1993, the Corporation's service area of
Idaho, Washington, Oregon and Utah was one of the strongest economic regions
of the country. Utah and Idaho led the nation in employment growth during much
of the year, with Utah's gains exceeding 5%.  Idaho's employment gains were
especially significant in the high technology sector, accompanied by strong
growth in tourism and business services. Oregon's economy began to recover from
the effects of drastic cuts in timber production on federal lands, and by late
1993 reported annual gains in employment of over 2%.  Strength in Washington
was largely offset by the effects of aerospace cutbacks; however, metropolitan
areas served by the Corporation outside of the Puget Sound region, including
Yakima, Spokane, Vancouver and the Tri-Cities, experienced vibrant and
expanding economies during the year with rising employment and construction
activity.

Lower interest rates and substantial net inmigration expanded residential
construction in Idaho, Oregon and Utah.  The number of new dwelling units
authorized was up 13% throughout the region in 1993 as Utah, Oregon and Idaho
posted gains of 41%, 17% and 14%, respectively, and no change was reported in
Washington.

Prospects for continued economic growth in the Corporation's service area
appear favorable in 1994, especially in light of an improving national economy. 
Construction activity is expected to remain strong in Idaho, Oregon and Utah. 
Washington's economy will not fully participate in the region's growth until
production levels in the aerospace industry stabilize.

SHAREHOLDERS' EQUITY AND CAPITAL ADEQUACY

The Corporation's strong capital position merits the confidence of customers,
investors and regulators, and provides a solid foundation for asset growth. 
Capital management ensures capital is available for current needs, anticipated
growth and advantageous business opportunities.  The Corporation regularly
monitors current and projected consolidated and subsidiary capital positions
to ensure capital levels exceed regulatory guidelines.

At December 31, 1993, shareholders' equity totaled $624 million, up 27% from
a year ago.  The primary source of additional shareholders' equity in 1993 was
$68 million of retained earnings, up 58% from 1992.  In addition, the
Corporation issued $47 million of common stock through a dividend reinvestment
and stock purchase plan providing shareholders the opportunity to purchase
common stock and reinvest dividends at a discount from the market price.  At
December 31, 1993, the Corporation adopted Statement of Financial Accounting
Standards (SFAS) No. 115, "Accounting for Certain Investments in Debt and
Equity Securities."  In accordance with the pronouncement, securities available
for sale were reported at market value and the resulting net unrealized after-
tax gain of $9 million was included in shareholders' equity, without impacting
net income or risk-based capital ratios in 1993.

Shareholders' equity as a percent of assets measures capital strength.  At
December 31, 1993, the Corporation's ratio increased to 8.13%, up from 6.87%
at December 31, 1992 and 6.78% at December 31, 1991.

In 1993, the Corporation paid dividends for the 58th consecutive year.  The
Corporation's dividend policy is designed to strike a balance between providing
immediate returns to shareholders through cash dividends and increasing long-
term shareholders' value through profitable utilization of earnings as capital. 
In recognition of record net income and a strong capital position, the
Corporation's Board of Directors increased the quarterly dividend by 16% to
$.18 per share in October 1993, representing the fifth consecutive year of
dividend increases.  On a per share basis, dividends paid in 1993 were $.595,
a 17% increase from $.51 in 1992.  The comparable dividend was $.47 in 1991. 

The market price per share of the Corporation's common stock was $28.50 at
December 31, 1993, or 159% of the $17.96 book value per share.  At year-end
1992, the market price was $25.375 or 168% of the $15.14 book value per share. 
The Corporation's market capitalization was $989.5 million at December 31,
1993, up 21% from $820.9 million a year ago.

The average annual compounded return to the Corporation's shareholders for the
five-year period ending December 31, 1993 assuming reinvestment of dividends
was 27%, significantly outperforming our peer group of 539 commercial banks
whose return was 13% and the NASDAQ market index return of 7%.

The Corporation's stock was held by 7,328 shareholders of record at December
31, 1993, and is traded in the over-the-counter market on the National Market
System of NASDAQ under the symbol WEST.  The accompanying market quotations
represent the high and low closing sales price per share for the indicated
periods, as reported by NASDAQ (NMS).

The Corporation is subject to risk-based capital guidelines established by the
Federal Reserve Board requiring minimum capital levels based on the perceived
risk of assets and off-balance sheet instruments.  The Corporation's strong
capital position, adequate allowance for credit losses, low intangible asset
level and limited off-balance sheet exposure resulted in capital ratios 
exceeding regulatory minimums as presented in the chart at left.  Bank
regulators also adopted five capital category definitions applicable to banks
for certain regulatory supervision purposes, ranging from well-capitalized to
critically undercapitalized.  At December 31, 1993, the Corporation and its
banking subsidiaries exceeded the regulatory criteria for well-capitalized
institutions and qualified for the minimum FDIC insurance assessment.

Double leverage is created when debt is incurred to acquire subsidiaries or to
increase a subsidiary's capital and when intangible assets arise from
acquisitions.  The double leverage ratio is calculated for the Parent Company
as the sum of investment in subsidiaries plus goodwill and core deposit
intangibles divided by total shareholders' equity.  Regulators have not
specified a maximum level of double leverage.  At December 31, 1993, the
Corporation's double leverage ratio improved to .98 compared to 1.11 and 1.04,
respectively, at December 31, 1992 and 1991.

NET INTEREST INCOME
Net interest income is the Corporation's principal source of revenue and is
comprised of interest income on earning assets minus interest expense on
interest bearing liabilities.  Net interest margin is net interest income
expressed as a percent of average earning assets and represents the difference
between the yield on earning assets and the composite interest rate paid on all
sources of funds.  Net interest income is adjusted to a taxable equivalent
basis to present income earned on taxable and tax-exempt assets on a comparable
basis.  References to net interest income and net interest margin in this
discussion represent taxable equivalent amounts.

Net interest income was $322.4 million in 1993, an increase of 28% from the
prior year.  Comparable increases were 20% in 1992 and 12% in 1991.  Net
interest income accounted for 76% of total revenue in 1993, 75% in 1992 and 74%
in 1991.  Net interest income is influenced primarily by changes in the volume
and mix of earning assets and funding sources, market rates of interest and
income tax rates.

Average earning assets increased $1.32 billion or 25% to $6.61 billion in 1993
following increases of 13% and 10%, respectively, in 1992 and 1991. 
Approximately 40% of the increase in 1993 was attributable to loans acquired
in the Washington Acquisition.  Loans represent the highest yielding component
of earning assets and accounted for 74% of average earning assets in 1993, up
from 71% in 1992 and 72% in 1991.

A significant shift in the mix of sources of funds improved net interest income
and net interest margin in 1993 and 1992.  Depositors, inclined to maintain
liquid investments during periods of low interest rates, shifted funds from
certificates of deposit to noninterest bearing demand deposits and lower cost
interest bearing demand and savings deposits.  Average noninterest bearing
funds increased to 16% of total sources of funds in 1993 from 14% in 1992 and
12% in 1991, resulting in lower interest expense, higher net interest income
and a wider net interest margin.  The shift in deposit mix may result in a
higher risk of future disintermediation of funding sources as customers seek
higher yielding investment alternatives.

Net interest margin increased 11 basis points to 4.87% in 1993 from 4.76% in
1992.  Net interest margin was 4.48% in 1991.  The yield on earning assets and
the cost of funds both declined in 1993, reflecting lower money market interest
rates.  Improvements in the mix of both earning assets and sources of funds,
combined with aggressive efforts to reduce funding costs and to price loans
profitably, resulted in a 75 basis point decrease in the cost of funds compared
to a 64 basis point decline in the earning asset yield.  Interest income
foregone net of tax on nonperforming loans declined to $1.1 million in 1993
from $1.7 million in 1992 and $2.2 million in 1991.  Nonaccrual loans declined
to .44% of total loans at December 31, 1993 from .46% at year-end 1992 and
1.20% at year-end 1991.  Net interest income and net interest margin also
improved in 1992 due to a favorable interest rate environment, steeper yield
curve, a higher volume of earning assets and improved asset quality.  The
accompanying table presents the detailed rate and volume analysis of earning
assets and interest bearing liabilities for the last three years.

Interest income is adjusted to present tax-exempt revenue from securities and   
loans on a basis comparable with taxable revenue, utilizing the statutory       
federal and the applicable state tax rates.                                     
                                                                                
The taxable equivalent adjustments were $18,473 in 1993, $13,125 in 1992 and   
$12,152 in 1991. Nonaccrual loans are included in average balances; however,    
interest income has not been accrued on such loans. Net changes which are       
attributable to volume and rate are allocated proportionately.

LOANS

Favorable economic conditions in the Corporation's market area created strong
loan demand in 1993.  Recent acquisitions in Washington also presented new
market opportunities.  Loans are the Corporation's primary earning asset and
totaled $5.35 billion at December 31, 1993, an increase of 18% from year-end
1992.  Loans increased 30% in 1992 and 6% in 1991.  Residential real estate
loans totaling $421 million were originated and sold in the secondary market
during 1993.  The average loan to deposit ratio was 86.18% in 1993 compared to
83.65% in 1992 and 85.50% in 1991.

Real estate loans were $2.15 billion at December 31, 1993 and represented 40%
of total loans.  Residential real estate loans increased 23% to $1.10 billion
at December 31, 1993 following increases of 46% and 10%, respectively, in 1992
and 1991.  Low mortgage interest rates, a high rate of inmigration to the
region and the consolidation of consumer debt into home equity credit lines in
response to tax legislation all contributed to the increase in 1993.

Commercial real estate loans increased 18% to $808 million at December 31, 1993
compared to increases of 47% in 1992 and 9% in 1991.  A major share of the
increase in 1993 represented loans to local business customers for expansion
of operations and facilities in response to consumer demand for products and

services.  Less than 1% of commercial real estate loans represented projects
outside the Corporation's local market area.

Construction loans increased 54% to $245 million at December 31, 1993 and
represented 11% of total real estate loans compared to 9% a year ago. 
Construction loans increased 32% in 1992 and 12% in 1991.  Dwelling units
authorized in the Corporation's market area increased 13% in 1993 due to an
acceleration in single and multi-family residential construction.

Commercial and agricultural loans totaled $2 billion at December 31, 1993, a
12% increase from the prior year, compared to increases of 30% in 1992 and 7%
in 1991.  The commercial loan increase in 1993 was consistent with improved
regional economic conditions as measured by increases in employment,
population, personal income and retail sales.  Management continues to
encourage growth in the small-to-middle market by emphasizing efficient and
personal service provided by the Corporation's community-based lending
officers.  Agricultural loans increased 9% to $392 million at December 31, 1993
as the Corporation maintained its position as one of the leading agricultural
lenders in the nation.

Consumer loans increased 19% to $1.04 billion at December 31, 1993 following
an increase of 10% in 1992 and no change in 1991.  Bankcard loan growth
reflected increases in merchants served, credit cards outstanding and
transactions.  Student, recreational vehicle and boat loans also contributed
to the increase. 

SECURITIES

The Corporation's securities portfolio is comprised of investment quality,
marketable debt securities.  Management's goal is to maximize long-term returns
while maintaining an acceptable level of risk.

The Corporation's securities portfolio declined 2% to $1.63 billion at December
31, 1993 to accommodate strong loan growth.  Securities increased 36% in 1992
due to the Washington Acquisition and 18% in 1991.  State and municipal bonds
increased 56% to $565 million at December 31, 1993 compared to the prior year
due to increased taxable equivalent yields resulting from higher federal tax
rates.  

Debt securities the Corporation has the ability and intent to hold to maturity
are reported at cost adjusted for the amortization of premiums and accretion
of discounts.  The aggregate market value of securities held to maturity at
December 31, 1993 exceeded aggregate cost by $30 million.  Securities available
for sale may be sold as a part of the Corporation's asset and liability
management process and are reported at market value.  Unrealized gains or
losses related to the adjustment of securities to market value are recorded net

market value of securities available for sale exceeded cost by $15 million.

SOURCES OF FUNDS

Earning assets are funded primarily by deposits acquired from a broad base of
local markets.  Deposits increased $301 million or 5% to $5.94 billion at
December 31, 1993 following increases of 39% in 1992, due primarily to the
Washington Acquisition, and 5% in 1991.  Growth in core deposits of $265
million or 5% to $5.47 billion accounted for most of the deposit increase in
1993.  Core deposits represented stable funds from local customers and funded
78% of earning assets at year-end 1993.

Average short-term borrowings as a percent of average earning assets declined
to 13% in 1993 from 14% in 1992 and 16% in 1991.  Other short-term borrowings
include United States Treasury borrowings, Federal Home Loan Bank borrowings
and commercial paper.  The 1993 increase in other short-term borrowings was
primarily attributable to United States Treasury borrowings, the least
expensive source of borrowed funds available.

ASSET AND LIABILITY MANAGEMENT

The Corporation's assets and liabilities are managed to maximize long-term
shareholder returns by optimizing net interest income within the constraints
of maintaining high credit quality, conservative interest rate risk disciplines
and prudent levels of leverage and liquidity.  The Asset and Liability
Committee meets regularly to monitor the composition of the balance sheet, to
assess current and projected interest rate trends and to formulate strategies
consistent with established objectives for liquidity, interest rate risk and
capital adequacy.

LIQUIDITY

The objective of liquidity management is to ensure the availability of
sufficient cash flows to meet all financial commitments and to capitalize on
opportunities for profitable business expansion.  Cash flow from operations
contributes significantly to liquidity.  Borrowings represent an important and
manageable source of liquidity based on the Corporation's ability to raise new
funds and renew maturing liabilities in a variety of markets.  Liquidity is
also obtained by maintaining assets that are readily convertible to cash at
minimal cost through maturities and sales.  Contingency plans exist and could
be implemented on a timely basis to minimize the risk associated with dramatic
changes in market conditions.

Deposit generation through the Corporation's extensive retail branch network
is an important source of liquidity.  Deposits increased at a five-year annual
compound growth rate of 11%.  Core deposits, comprised of certificates of
deposit under $100 thousand and local market transaction and savings accounts,
are a highly reliable source of funds.  Core deposits represented 92% of total
deposits at year-ends 1993 and 1992, and 91% at year-end 1991.  The Corporation
is able to attract but has not used brokered deposits from outside its market
area.

Securities available for sale totaled $1.06 billion at December 31, 1993,
representing a highly accessible source of liquidity.  Held to maturity
securities will provide liquidity through maturities of $40 million in 1994.

Liquidity is also available through a variety of domestic money and capital
markets.  Short-term borrowings provide a consistent source of funding and are
comprised primarily of securities sold under agreements to repurchase, United
States Treasury borrowings and federal funds purchased.  Additional amounts of
short-term funds are raised through commercial paper and bank notes.  Back-up 

                                       -22-

<PAGE>
sources of liquidity are provided by credit lines available to West One
Bancorp.  Washington, Oregon and Utah subsidiaries have access to liquidity and
matched funding from the Federal Home Loan Bank of Seattle.  Additional
liquidity could be generated through borrowings from the Federal Reserve Bank
of San Francisco.

The Corporation's investment grade ratings by Moody's and Standard & Poor's
provide flexibility in meeting liquidity requirements through access to
national markets.  Thompson BankWatch's issuer rating for West One Bancorp is
"B" and the short-term ratings of the Corporation and West One Bank, Idaho are
"TBW-1," the highest rating available.  
 
Asset liquidity also arises from scheduled loan repayments.  At December 31,
1993, scheduled principal payments due within one year were $1.96 billion or
37%  of loans.  The Corporation sells a majority of its residential mortgage
loan production, contributing to overall liquidity.  In addition, portions of
the Corporation's residential mortgage, consumer and credit card loan
portfolios could be securitized and sold to increase liquidity. 

The Corporation maintains a position of short-term investments consisting of
interest bearing deposits, federal funds sold and securities purchased under
agreements to resell that averaged $42 million in 1993.  The position provides
flexibility in balancing the fluctuating borrowing requirements of customers
with the Corporation's daily funding capacity.

In 1994, $14 million of long-term debt matures.  The debt obligations will be
met through additional external financing and internally generated cash. 
Aggregate long-term debt maturities over the next five years total $66 million.

INTEREST RATE SENSITIVITY

The Corporation's net interest income is affected by changes in the level of
market interest rates.  Management's objectives are to control interest rate
risk and to ensure predictable and consistent growth in net interest income.

Interest rate risk management focuses on fluctuations in net interest income
identified through computer simulations to evaluate volatility under varying
interest rate, spread and volume assumptions.  The risk is quantified and
compared against risk tolerance levels designed to maintain stability in net
interest income.  Sensitivity analysis indicated that the Corporation was
moderately liability sensitive and within established tolerance limits during
1993.

The Asset and Liability Maturity Repricing Schedule on page 24 depicts variable
rate instruments in the time period the balances are eligible for repricing and
fixed rate instruments according to repayment schedules.  The analysis provides
a general measure of interest rate risk but does not address complexities such
as prepayment risk, interperiod sensitivities, interest rate floors and
ceilings imposed on financial instruments, interest rate dynamics and
customers' response to interest rate changes.

PROVISION AND ALLOWANCE FOR CREDIT LOSSES

The provision for credit losses is the expense incurred to maintain an adequate
allowance for anticipated credit losses.  Actual credit losses, net of
recoveries of previously charged-off loans, are charged directly against the
allowance.  The allowance for credit losses reflects management's current
estimate of the amount required to absorb losses on existing loans and
commitments to extend credit.  Determination of the appropriate level of the
allowance is based on an analysis of various factors including historical loss
experience based on volumes and types of loans; volumes and trends in
delinquencies and nonaccruals; trends in portfolio volume, maturity and
composition; results of internal or independent external credit reviews;
industrial and geographical concentrations; and anticipated economic
conditions.  Each affiliate regularly evaluates its allowance for credit
losses.  The adequacy of the allowance is subject to quarterly review by an
executive committee and the audit committee of the Board of Directors.  Based
on this analysis, management considers the allowance for credit losses to be
adequate.

The Corporation's asset quality ratios ranked among the best in the industry
in 1993.  Net charge-offs were $7.1 million or .14% of average loans in 1993
compared to $9.8 million or .26% of average loans in 1992.  In 1991, net
charge-offs totaled $24.5 million or .73% of average loans.  During the last
two years, gross charge-offs totaled $35.6 million while recoveries amounted
to $18.7 million for a recovery ratio of 53%.  

Nonperforming assets declined 9% to $28 million at December 31, 1993 from $31
million at December 31, 1992.  At December 31, 1991 nonperforming assets were
$54 million.  As a percent of total assets, nonperforming assets were .37% at
December 31, 1993 compared to .44% a year ago and 1.00% at December 31, 1991.
Other credit risk assets include loans with serious concern, defined as loans
classified as doubtful but accruing interest, and accruing loans past due 90
days or more.  At December 31, 1993, other credit risk assets totaled $5
million, a 25% decrease from $7 million at December 31, 1992.  Other credit
risk assets totaled $8 million at December 31, 1991.

The provision for credit losses was $13.4 million in 1993, a 6% decrease from
the $14.3 million reported in 1992.  In 1991, the provision for credit losses
was $29.7 million.

The allowance for credit losses was $75 million at December 31, 1993, a 10%
increase from $68 million a year ago.  At December 31, 1991, the allowance for
credit losses was $53 million.  The allowance for credit losses represented
1.40% of total loans at December 31, 1993 compared to 1.51% and 1.52%,
respectively, at year-ends 1992 and 1991.  The allowance for credit losses
covered 311% of nonperforming loans at December 31, 1993.  

CREDIT RISK

The Corporation's credit policies are designed to minimize losses.  The
policies require extensive evaluation of new requests for credit and continuing
review of existing credits to ensure early identification and monitoring of any
evidence of deteriorating loan quality, and quantification of possible loss. 
A loan is placed on nonaccrual status when all or a portion of the interest is
deemed uncollectible.  

The Corporation's objective is to maintain a loan portfolio that is diverse in
terms of the type of loans and borrowers, industry concentration, economic
conditions and geographic distribution in an effort to minimize the adverse
impact of a single event.

The Corporation's recent geographic expansion in Washington and Oregon resulted
in a more diversified loan portfolio.  In 1993, 50% of the Corporation's loans
were in Idaho compared to 81% in 1985.  Strong economic conditions in the
Corporation's market area are evidenced by healthy commercial and residential
real estate and construction industries.  All four states experienced
significant population growth in 1993 indicating continued strong demand for

new housing units.  Commercial vacancy rates in the major metropolitan areas
of Boise, Seattle, Portland and Salt Lake City are running well below the
national average.

Commercial loans, the second largest loan category, included no significant
industry concentrations.  Agricultural and related loans represented the
largest single industry concentration in the loan portfolio, accounting for 10%
of total loans at December 31, 1993.  The average balance per commercial and
agricultural loan was $86 thousand at December 31, 1993.

Foreign loans totaled only $3 million at December 31, 1993.  At year-end 1993,
agreements to extend credit totaled $2.26 billion compared to $1.56 billion and
$1.25 billion at year-ends 1992 and 1991, respectively.  Economic conditions

impact credit risk and the Corporation's customers may be adversely impacted
by a downturn in the national economy.

NONINTEREST INCOME

Noninterest income increased 23% to $102.5 million in 1993 following increases
of 15% in 1992 and 17% in 1991.  Other service charges, fees and commissions
included bank card income that increased $6.8 million or 55% in 1993 due to
increased credit cards outstanding, transaction volumes and merchants served. 
Other income included gains on the sale of real estate loans and servicing
which increased $1.1 million or 22% in 1993 as a result of significant
residential mortgage refinancing activity due to low interest rates. 
Noninterest income in 1993 also reflected the first full-year impact of the
Washington Acquisition. 

An increasing percentage of the Corporation's earnings is noninterest income
generated from a wide variety of fee-based financial products and services. 
Over the past five years, the compound growth rate for noninterest income,
excluding securities gains and losses, was 19% and exceeded the five-year
compound growth rate of 12% for assets.

NONINTEREST EXPENSE

Noninterest expense increased 26% to $272.4 million in 1993 compared with
increases of 18% and 12%, respectively, in 1992 and 1991.  The current year
increase reflected the first full-year impact of the Washington Acquisition. 
Employee benefits expense in 1993 included $1.7 million of post-retirement
benefits in accordance with SFAS No. 106.  The interest rate environment in
1993 that was particularly favorable to mortgage origination volume also caused
significant prepayments in the mortgage servicing portfolio.  Increased
prepayments reduced loans serviced and necessitated an acceleration of the
amortization of purchased mortgage servicing rights.  The amortization
increased to $4.1 million in 1993 from $1.4 million in 1992.  In 1993, the
Corporation established a telephone response system providing immediate
customer service seven days a week, twenty-four hours a day.  The Customer
Service Center is a convenient alternative for customers and reduces retail
branch expenses.

INCOME TAXES

The effective income tax rate for the year-ended December 31, 1993 was 31.0%
compared to 30.6% in 1992 and 28.3% in 1991.  The current year change reflected
the increase in the corporate federal tax rate to 35% in 1993 from 34% in 1992. 
Note 13 to the financial statements reconciles the effective income tax rates
to the federal statutory rates.  The implementation of SFAS No. 109,
"Accounting for Income Taxes," had no material effect on the income statement
or balance sheet.

INFLATION

In the opinion of management, inflation and changes in prices have not had a
material effect on the Corporation's financial results in 1993, 1992 and 1991.

NOTE 1. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES
Dollars in thousands
                             
The accounting and reporting policies of West One Bancorp and its subsidiaries
(West One) conform with generally accepted accounting principles and general 
practice in the banking industry.  West One paid a two-for-one stock split on
August 13, 1993 for which prior period amounts have been restated.  The 
significant policies are summarized below.
 
Principles of Consolidation 

The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of West One with
elimination of material intercompany transactions and balances.  The Parent
Company only financial statements (Note 15) reflect investment in subsidiaries
using the equity basis of accounting.

Certain reclassifications have been made to prior year financial statements to
conform to the 1993 presentation. Assets owned by others and held in a
fiduciary or agency capacity by subsidiaries are not included in the
consolidated balance sheets.

Acquisitions 

In May 1993, West One acquired Ben Franklin National Bank in exchange for
206,254 shares of West One's common stock.  At the date of acquisition, Ben
Franklin National Bank had year-to-date revenue of $2,171, year-to-date net
loss of $6 and total assets of $36,531.  The transaction was accounted for as
a pooling of interests. Ben Franklin National Bank's financial position and
results of operations were not material to West One's financial position and
results of operations, and prior year financial statements have not been 
restated.

In October 1992, West One acquired Yakima Valley Bank in exchange for 913,694
shares of  West One's common stock.  At the date of acquisition, Yakima Valley
Bank had year-to-date revenue of $8,527, year-to-date net income of $895 and
total assets of $119,493.  The transaction was accounted for as a pooling of
interests. Because Yakima Valley Bank's financial position and results of
operations were not material to West One's financial position and results of
operations, and prior year financial statements have not been restated.

In September 1992, West One purchased 38 branches and seven specialty offices
in the Puget Sound region of Washington from Security Pacific Corporation.  The
transaction included the receipt of $315 million of cash, $837 million of
loans, $21 million of premises and equipment, $21 million of intangible and
other assets, and the assumption of approximately $1.2 billion of deposits. 
In July 1992, West One purchased three branches of Bank of America Oregon. The 
transaction included the receipt of $45 million of cash, $1 million of loans, 
$1 million of premises and equipment, $1 million of intangible and other
assets, and the assumption of $48 million of deposits and other liabilities.
Both of these transactions were accounted for as purchases of certain assets
and assumptions of certain liabilities.

In December 1991, West One acquired Washington Federal Savings Bank (WFSB) in 
exchange for 2,049,030 shares of West One common stock in a transaction
accounted for as a pooling of interests.    WFSB had total assets of $358,000
at the date of acquisition and revenue of $36,733 and net income of $3,365 in
1991 prior to the acquisition. WFSB paid dividends of $687 in 1991. 
   
Securities                                                                   
                                
On December 31, 1993, West One adopted Statement of Financial Accounting   
Standards (SFAS) No. 115, "Accounting for Certain Investments in Debt and
Equity Securities."  Under this pronouncement securities held to maturity are
stated at cost, adjusted for amortization of premiums and accretion of
discounts.  Securities available for sale and trading account securities are
stated at market value.  Gains and losses on sale of securities, recognized on
a specific identification basis, and valuation adjustments of trading account
securities are included in noninterest income. Net unrealized gain or loss on
securities available for sale are included, net of tax, as a component of
shareholders' equity.                                                        
                
Loans                                                                       

Loans and leases are stated at the principal amount outstanding, net of
unearned income.  Interest on loans is recognized as income based on the     
outstanding principal and the stated interest rates as adjusted for net      
deferred loan fees, premiums and discounts.  Loan origination fees and costs 

                                     -34-

are deferred and recognized as income on the interest method over the life of 
the loans.  Lease income, primarily from financing leases, is recognized on the
level interest method. Recognition of interest income is discontinued and all 
accrued, unpaid interest is reversed when a loan is placed on nonaccrual 
status. A loan or lease is placed on nonaccrual status when timely collection 
of interest becomes doubtful. Interest payments received on nonaccrual loans 
and leases are applied to principal if collection of principal is doubtful or 
reflected as interest income on a cash basis. Loans and leases are removed from
nonaccrual status when they are current and collectibility of principal and  
interest is no longer doubtful.  Loans held for sale are stated at the lower
of cost or market.                                                           
     
Allowance for Credit Losses                                                  

The allowance for credit losses is maintained at a level considered adequate
by management to provide for losses inherent in the portfolio of loans, leases
and commitments to extend credit .  Loans sold with servicing released have  
technical underwriting exception and repurchase risks which are also considered
in the determination of the adequacy of the allowance for credit losses.  The 
estimate of additions to the allowance for credit losses, and resulting charge 
to expense, requires judgment in evaluating the borrower's management,  
financial position, cash flow, collateral values and guarantees, as well as  
projection of the outcome of future events.  The continuing adequacy of the
allowance for credit losses is determined based upon the results of a credit 
classification system, internal and external credit examinations, historic  
experience, economic conditions, industry concentrations, elements of risk and 
other loss factors affecting the quality of the loan portfolio.   
                                                                             
Premises and Equipment                                                       
                                                                           
Premises, equipment, major improvements and replacements are stated at cost. 
Depreciation is recognized on the straight-line method over the estimated
useful life of the asset.  Leasehold improvements are amortized over the  
shorter of the useful life of the asset or the remaining term of the lease.  
Gains or losses from disposal of premises and equipment are reflected in  
noninterest expense. Maintenance and repairs are expensed and improvements are
capitalized. Costs of purchased and internally-developed software are amortized
over periods up to five years. 
                                                         
Other Real Estate Owned                                                      

Other real estate owned consists principally of properties acquired through 
foreclosure and is stated at the lower of cost or market value.    
                                                                             
Other Assets                           
                                                                             
Other assets include goodwill and core deposit intangibles and are stated at
cost, net of amortization provided on straight-line and level interest methods
over useful lives ranging up to 25 years.  Purchased mortgage servicing rights 
are stated at cost net of amortization based on the income method and related
prepayment assumptions.                                                      
 
Income Taxes                                                                 
 
Income taxes are provided on earnings as reported for financial statement  
purposes adjusted principally for nontaxable interest income. Deferred income
taxes reflect the tax effect of temporary differences between financial
statement income and taxable income.
  
In 1993, West One adopted SFAS No. 109, "Accounting for Income Taxes," which
prescribes the use of the liability method of accounting for income taxes. 
Under this method, the change between periods in the deferred tax assets and 
liabilities together with income taxes currently payable are reflected as
income tax expense in the financial statements.            
                                                                             
Earnings per Share    
                                                            
Primary and fully diluted earnings per share are computed using the weighted 
average number of common and common equivalent shares outstanding. Common 
equivalent shares result from the assumed exercise of outstanding stock  
options, if dilutive.  Fully diluted earnings per share assumes conversion of 
the convertible debentures, if dilutive. 

Statements of Cash Flows

Cash and cash equivalents consist of cash and due from banks.                
  
New Pronouncements                                                           
                                               
The Financial Accounting Standards Board has issued SFAS No. 112, "Employers' 
Accounting for Postemployment Benefits," effective for years beginning after
December 15, 1993, and SFAS No. 114, "Accounting by Creditors for Impairment
of a Loan," effective for years beginning after December 15, 1994. Neither 
statement is expected to have a material effect on West One.

The average balance is computed on a daily average method. The average rate is  
computed by dividing total interest expense by the average outstanding balance. 
                                                                                
Other short-term borrowings consist of United States Treasury borrowings, bank  
notes and commercial paper.  Unused lines of credit aggregating $45,000 at      
December 31, 1993 were maintained with banks in support of commercial paper.    
The lines bear interest at short-term money market rates if drawn upon, and    
required commitment fees of $84, $76, and $76 in 1993, 1992 and 1991,         
respectively.

</TABLE>
(a)   Commitments to extend credit have fixed maturity dates and represent West
One's obligations to fund commercial and real estate loans, including home  
equity lines, lines of credit, revolving lines of credit and other types of   
commitments. Letters of credit are performance assurances of customer   
obligations or guarantees of financing for trade transactions. West One's
exposure to credit loss for commitments to extend credit and letters of credit,
in the event of nonperformance by others, is represented by the contractual
amount of the instruments.  Since many commitments to extend credit are expected
to expire without being drawn upon, the total commitments do not necessarily 
represent future cash requirements.  West One follows the same credit policies
in making commitments and conditional obligations as it does for on-balance
sheet instruments. Collateral varies, but may include accounts receivable,
inventory, premises and equipment, and commercial properties.  West One's 
lending activities are concentrated in Idaho, Washington, Oregon and Utah.
 
(b)  Forward sale and purchased option contracts and interest rate swaps are 
typically hedges against interest rate risk on specific assets or liabilities.
West One's forward sales and purchased options are contracts to buy or sell
mortgage-backed securities to hedge interest rate risk on fixed rate mortgage
loan or rate commitments.  Net positions are valued at the lower of cost or 
market.  Gains or losses are recognized upon settlement of the forward sale 
contracts based on the difference between the net sales proceeds and the net
carrying value of the loans sold.  Purchased options are contracts to buy or 
sell mortgage-backed securities at fixed prices during a specified period. The 
option premium paid, which represents loss exposure, is amortized over the life 
of the option. 

Interest rate swap agreements involve the exchange of fixed and floating rate 
interest payments without the exchange of the underlying notional amount on
which the interest payments are calculated.  The differential between the fixed
and variable rate is recorded as interest income or expense of the liability 
being hedged.  Prior to expiration of the interest rate swap agreements, West 
One paid fixed interest rates averaging 8.39% in 1993 and 8.46% in 1992 and 
received floating interest rates based on LIBOR. 

The credit and market risks associated with forward sale and purchased option 
contracts, and interest rate swaps arise from the possible inability of 
counterparties to meet the terms of the contracts and from fluctuations in
securities' values and interest rates.  West One limits credit risk by 
restricting counterparties to a list of approved institutions. Generally, West 
One does not require collateral for these types of instruments.

(c)  The credit and market risks associated with foreign exchange contracts,
which may arise from the counterparty's inability to make payment at the
settlement date and fluctuations in value of a foreign currency in relation to
the U.S. dollar, were nominal at December 31, 1993 and 1992.
 
West One is a defendant in various pending lawsuits, arising in the ordinary
course of business, none of which are expected to have a material effect on 
West One's financial position or results of operations.

NOTE 9. SHAREHOLDERS' EQUITY
 
Authorized capital stock of West One consists of 75,000,000 shares of $1.00 par
value common stock and 5,000,000 shares of $1.00 par value preferred stock, of
which 150,000 preferred shares are reserved for issuance under the Shareholder
Rights Plan.
 
On July 15, 1993, the Board of Directors declared a two-for-one common stock
split, issued in the form of stock dividend, payable August 13, 1993 to 
shareholders of record on July 23, 1993.  The number of common shares
outstanding, shares issued, stock option information, dividends declared per
share, common stock and retained earnings have been restated to reflect the
stock split for all prior periods presented. 
 
At December 31, 1993 securities available for sale were stated at market and the
resulting net after-tax unrealized gain of $9,083 is presented as a component of
shareholders' equity.

On October 19, 1989 the Board of Directors adopted a Shareholder Rights Plan.
Under the terms of the Plan, the Board declared a dividend distribution of one
Right for each share of common stock outstanding on October 31, 1989, or at
specified times thereafter.  When initially issued each Right entitled the
registered holder to purchase from West One a unit consisting of one-hundredth
of a share of Series A Junior Participating Preferred Stock at a purchase price
of $150 per unit, subject to adjustment.  Following a dividend distribution on
August 13, 1993 of one share of common stock for each share of common stock
outstanding as of July 23, 1993, pursuant to the adjustment provision contained
in the Rights Plan, each share of common stock outstanding following the 
distribution had associated with it 0.5 Rights, and each new share of common
stock issued  thereafter and prior to the Distribution Date (as defined) will be
issued 0.5 Rights.

The rights will become exercisable upon the occurrence of specified events which
could result in a change in control of West One or upon the determination by the
Board that an Adverse Person (as defined) beneficially owns 10 percent or more
of the outstanding common stock.  Once the Rights become exercisable, if the
Board determines that a person is an Adverse Person or a person becomes the 
owner of 25 percent or more of the then-outstanding shares of common stock (with
certain exceptions), each holder of a Right (other than an Acquiring Person (as
defined) or an Adverse Person) will thereafter become entitled to receive, upon
payment of the exercise price, common stock (or in certain circumstances other
consideration) having a value equal to two times the exercise price or, at the
discretion of the Board, to receive common stock (or other consideration) having
one-half that value without payment of the exercise price.  The Rights are
nonvoting, may be redeemed by West One at a price of $.01 per Right at any time
until ten business days after an individual or group acquires 20 percent of West
One's common stock and expire on October 31, 1999.  The issuance of the Rights
is intended to encourage any potential acquiror of West One to negotiate the
manner and terms of the transaction with the Board and to protect shareholders
from unsolicited tender offers which do not treat all shareholders in a fair and
equal manner, and from other coercive takeover tactics.  

Under shareholder approved incentive programs, the Board of Directors may grant

</TABLE>
Financial assets and financial liabilities other than securities and certain
long-term debt of West One are not traded in active markets. Estimated fair
values require subjective judgments and are approximate.  The above estimates
of fair value are not necessarily representative of amounts that could be     
realized in actual market transactions, nor of the underlying value of West
One.  Changes in the following methodologies and assumptions could significantly
affect the estimates:             
                                                                               
Financial assets                                                               
                                                                               
The estimated fair value approximates the book value of cash and short-term    
investments.  For securities, the fair value is based on quoted market prices. 
The book value of securities at December 31, 1993 includes securities          
available for sale stated at market value and securities held to maturity      
stated at historical cost.  At December 31, 1992, the book value of all        
securities was historical cost. See Note 2 to the financial statements.     
The fair value of loans is estimated by discounting future cash flows using    
current rates at which similar loans would be made, net of the present value   
of estimated net charge-offs.
 
Financial liabilities                                                         
                                                                               
The estimated fair value of demand and savings deposits approximates book
value.  The value of long-term relationships with depositors is not reflected.
The fair value of time certificates of deposit is estimated by discounting
future cash flows using current rates offered on similar certificates.  For
short-term borrowings, the fair value approximates book value.  The estimated
fair value of long-term debt is based on quoted market prices or estimates of
discounted cash flows using current rates at which similar financing could be
obtained.  
 
Off-balance sheet financial instruments

Commitments to extend credit and letters of credit represent the principal
categories of off-balance sheet financial instruments.  The fair value of
these commitments is not material.  See Note 8 to the financial statements.

NOTE 11. EMPLOYEE BENEFITS

West One has a noncontributory defined benefit retirement plan covering
substantially all employees.  Benefits to retired employees are based on years
of service and compensation. West One funds at least the minimum annual
contributions required by the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974.
Since plan assets exceeded accumulated benefit obligation, no additional
funding was made in 1993, 1992 or 1991.

West One also has three unfunded supplemental retirement plans.  The
Supplemental Executive Retirement Plan provides supplemental benefits to
eligible employees when the employee's earnings exceed the dollar amount used
for the definition of a highly compensated employee in the Internal Revenue
Code (IRC) Section 414 (q) (1) (B) during each of the three preceding years.
The Non-Qualified IRC 415 Benefit Limit Make-Up plan provides for additional
payments to be made to employees whose defined pension benefit exceeds the
limit for maximum benefits from the defined benefit pension plan.  The 
Executive Deferred Compensation Pension Make-Up plan covers pension benefits
resulting from salary deferrals which have not been included in the computation
of benefits under the regular defined benefit pension plan.

West One has an Employee Thrift Investment Plan, under IRC Section 401,
covering substantially all employees.  Under the plan, West One made
contributions of 50% of participating employees' salary deferrals up to 6% of
salary in 1993, 5% of salary in 1992 and 4% of salary in 1991, aggregating
$2,384 for 1993, $1,566 for 1992 and $1,078 for 1991.
                                                                                
West One provides certain health care insurance benefits for retired employees
and their dependents.  Substantially all of West One's retirees are eligible
for those benefits if they retired directly from service with at least ten
years of credited service.  Retiree contributions are required depending on age
and number of years of service at the time of retirement.

In 1993 West One assumed a 14% annual rate of increase in the per capita cost
of covered retiree and dependent health care benefits.  The medical trend rate
was assumed to decrease gradually to 6% in 2006 and remain at that level for
future years. A one percentage point increase in the assumed health care cost
trend rate would increase the accumulated postretirement benefit obligation at
December 31, 1993 by $1,314 and the aggregate of the service cost and interest
cost components of net periodic postretirement benefit expense for 1993 by 
$138.

The discount rate used in determining the actuarial present value of the
projected postretirement benefit obligation was 7.5%. The salary limits which
determine the amount of the deductible paid by the employee were assumed to
increase in proportion to West One salary levels.

A subsidiary has preacquisition investment tax credit carryforwards remaining  
of $500 which expire through 2003.  Upon realization, the benefit of these tax
carryforwards will be reflected as reductions of the purchase price allocated 
to acquired intangible assets. 

The tax benefits of stock options exercised of $1,900 in 1993, $1,700 in 1992
and $1,400 in 1991 have been allocated to shareholders' equity.  In 1993 the
deferred provision for income taxes of $5,800 for unrealized securities gains
has been allocated to shareholders' equity.

Deferred tax liabilities of approximately $2,100 have not been recognized for a
thrift subsidiary's base year tax bad debt reserve of $5,300.  If the
subsidiary fails to qualify as a savings and loan association or is converted
to a commercial bank the bad debt reserve would become taxable.  Management
does not expect this difference to reverse in the foreseeable future.

NOTE 14. REGULATORY REQUIREMENTS and RESTRICTIONS
Dollars in thousands

Regulatory authorities require banks to maintain cash reserves against deposits
which vary according to the type and maturity of the deposit.  Cash reserve
balances at December 31, 1993 and 1992 were $144,998 and $118,460,
respectively.

Loans to directors, executive officers and their associates are subject to
regulatory limitations.  Such loans, which are within the regulatory
limitations, totaled $35,021 and $36,328 at December 31, 1993 and 1992,
respectively.  During 1993 there were $137,254 of additions and $138,561 of
reductions of such loans.  During 1992 there were $131,029 of additions and
$132,704 in reductions of these loans.

Federal and state laws also place limitations on the extension of credit by
banking subsidiaries to the Parent Company and nonbank affiliates.  Under these
restrictions, banking subsidiaries may not extend credit beyond an aggregate of
$94,155 to the Parent Company as of December 31, 1993.  Any extensions of such
credit are subject to strict collateral requirements.

Federal and state laws restrict the amount of dividends that may be declared by
banking subsidiaries without the approval of regulatory authorities.  Banking
subsidiaries may declare dividends to the Parent Company in 1994 up to $141,465
plus 1994 net income to the date of dividend declaration.

Report of Independent Accountants


To the Shareholders and Directors of West One Bancorp


We have audited the consolidated balance sheets of West One Bancorp
and subsidiaries as of December 31, 1993 and 1992, and the related
consolidated statements of income, shareholders' equity and cash
flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31,
1993.  These financial statements are the responsibility of
management.  Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these
financial statements based on our audits.

We conducted our audits in accordance with generally accepted
auditing standards.  Those standards require that we plan and
perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the
financial statements are free of material misstatement.  An audit
includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the
amounts and disclosures in the financial statements.  An audit also
includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant
estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall
financial statement presentation.  We believe that our audits
provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.

In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present
fairly, in all material respects, the consolidated financial
position of West One Bancorp and subsidiaries as of December 31,
1993 and 1992 and the consolidated results of their operations and
their cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended
December 31, 1993, in conformity with generally accepted accounting
principles.

As discussed in Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements,
during 1993 the Company adopted Statement of Financial Accounting
Standards No. 115, "Accounting for Certain Investments in Debt and
Equity Securities".
