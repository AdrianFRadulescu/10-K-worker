ITEM 1 - BUSINESS 
West One Bancorp, (the Registrant) is an Idaho corporation formed in 1981 as a 
bank holding company subject to regulation under the Bank Holding Company Act 
of 1956, as amended, and is registered with the Board of Governors of the

The Registrant, through its subsidiaries, provides a wide variety of financial
services to corporate and institutional customers, governments, individuals, and

banking, investment and funds management, personal banking, trust operations, 
corporate services, mortgage banking and credit life insurance.  As of

was the second national bank to be established west of the Rocky Mountains.  
When branch banking was authorized in 1933, West One, Idaho acquired three 
affiliated banks, thus beginning the development of its present statewide 
banking organization in Idaho. 
 
West One, Idaho is an Idaho-chartered bank supervised and regulated at the state
level by the Director of the Idaho Department of Finance and at the federal 
level by the Federal Reserve Board. West One, Idaho is insured by the Bank 
Insurance Fund (BIF) and is therefore also subject to regulations issued by the 
Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC).  (See "Supervision and Regulation 
- - Other Regulations.")   
 
On January 21, 1994, West One, Idaho acquired Idaho State Bank with assets of 
$48 million in exchange for 133,332 shares of the Registrant's common stock.  
The transaction was accounted for as a pooling of interests.  Idaho State 
Bank's financial position and results of operations were not material to West 
One's financial position and results of operations and prior year financial 
statements have not been restated. 
 
Idaho is the primary market area of West One, Idaho.  West One, Idaho offers
a full range of commercial and personal banking and trust services.  Its  
corporate banking department

market and large corporate borrowers.  The principal industries in Idaho include
agriculture, forest products, services, tourism, mining and manufacturing.

for deposits, loans, and trust accounts with other banks and financial 
institutions.  At December 31, 1994, West One had $4.4 billion in assets and 90 
branches.  Based on assets of $4.1 billion at September 30, 1994, West One,

accounted for as a pooling of interests.  National Security Bank's financial

data processing centers in Boise, Idaho, Salt Lake City, Utah and Renton, 
Washington, the Registrant processes demand deposit accounts, savings accounts, 
installment consumer loans, commercial loans and real estate loans for a
majority of its subsidiaries. 
 
SUPERVISION AND REGULATION 
The Registrant's banking subsidiaries are affected by the policies of regulatory
authorities, including the monetary policy of the Federal Reserve Board.  In 
order to mitigate recessionary and inflationary pressures, the Federal Reserve 
Board uses a variety of money supply management techniques, including engaging 
in open market operations in United States Government securities, changing the 
discount rate on member bank borrowings, and changing reserve requirements 
against member bank deposits.  The impact of current economic conditions on the 
policies of the Federal Reserve Board and other regulatory authorities and their
effect on the future business and earnings of the Registrant cannot be predicted
with assurance. 
 
The Registrant is subject to regulation under the Bank Holding Company Act of
1956, as amended.  Under that Act, the Registrant is required to obtain the 
approval of the Federal Reserve Board before it may acquire all or substantially
all of the assets of any bank or ownership or control of any voting securities 
of any bank not already majority owned if, after giving effect to the 
acquisition, the Registrant would own or control more than five percent of the 
voting shares of such bank. 
 
The Bank Holding Company Act of 1956 generally does not permit the Federal 
Reserve Board to approve an acquisition by a bank holding company of voting 
shares or assets of a bank located outside the state in which the operations of 
its banking subsidiaries are principally conducted unless the acquisition is 
specifically authorized by the statutes of the states in which the banks are 
located.  Each of the states in the Registrant's marketing area have adopted 
legislation that permits bank acquisition by out-of-state bank holding 
companies, with certain restrictions.   
 
The Bank Holding Company Act of 1956 also prohibits, with certain exceptions, 
the Registrant from engaging in or acquiring direct or indirect control of
more than five percent   
 
                                       Page 6 
 
<PAGE> 
 
of the voting shares of any company engaged in nonbanking activities.  One of 
the principal exceptions to this prohibition applies to activities found by 
the Federal Reserve Board to be so closely related to banking as to be a proper 
incident thereto.  Some of the activities which the Federal Reserve Board has 
determined by regulation to be closely related to banking are:  mortgage 
banking, certain data processing operations, personal property leasing on a full
payout basis and operation of a consumer finance business.  The Registrant is 
not subject to territorial restrictions on the operations of nonbank 
subsidiaries. 
 
The Registrant and its subsidiaries are prohibited from engaging in certain 
"tie-in" arrangements in connection with extensions of credit or provision of 
any property or service. Also, the Registrant's banking subsidiaries are subject
to restrictions on loans to the Registrant or its subsidiaries, investments in 
stock or other securities of the Registrant or its subsidiaries, or advances to 
any borrower collateralized by such stock or other securities. 
 
In December 1991, Congress enacted the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation 
Improvement Act of 1991 (FDICIA), which substantially revises the bank 
regulatory and funding provisions of the Federal Deposit Insurance Act and makes
revisions to several other federal banking statutes. 
 
In addition to establishing minimum capital requirements, FDICIA directs that 
each federal banking agency prescribe standards for depository institutions and 
depository institution holding companies relating to internal controls, 
information systems, internal audit systems, loan documentation, credit 
underwriting, interest rate exposure, asset growth, compensation, a maximum 
ratio of classified assets to capital and such other standards as the agency 
deems appropriate.   
 
FDICIA also contains a variety of other provisions that may affect the 
operations of the Registrant including new reporting requirements, revised 
regulatory standards for real estate lending, truth in savings provisions, 
and the requirement that a depository institution give 90 days' notice to 
customers and regulatory authorities before closing any branch.

A loan or lease is placed on nonaccrual status when timely collection of 
interest becomes doubtful.  Interest payments received on nonaccrual loans and
leases are applied to principal if collection of principal is doubtful or 
reflected as interest income on a cash basis.  Loans and leases are removed from
nonaccrual status when they are current and collectibility of principal and 
interest is no longer doubtful. 
 
Income foregone on nonaccrual and restructured loans, net of tax, was $984,000, 
$1,086,000 and $1,650,000 for the years ended December 31, 1994, 1993 and 1992,

MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF
FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS
Management's discussion and analysis of West One Bancorp and subsidiaries (the 
Corporation) supplements the accompanying consolidated financial statements.

Performance Overview
The Corporation completed the most profitable year in its 127 year history in 
1994.  Net income was $103.2 million, a 24% increase over the $83.2 million 
earned in 1993.  Net income was 31% higher in 1993 than the $63.4 million earned
in 1992.  Highlights of 1994 include the continuation of double-digit loan 
growth, outstanding asset quality and the sixth consecutive increase in annual 
shareholders' dividends.  Nonperforming assets declined to .29% of total assets
and the allowance for credit losses was over 400% of nonperforming loans at 
December 31, 1994.  Capital ratios strengthened in 1994 and easily exceeded 
regulatory requirements.  Earnings per share increased 15% to $2.74 in 1994 
following an increase of 20% to $2.38 in 1993.  The five-year compound growth 
rate was 24% for net income and 17% for earnings per share.

Return on assets averaged 1.28% in 1994, an improvement from returns of 1.14% 
and 1.08% in 1993 and 1992, respectively.  Return on shareholders' equity 
averaged 15.63% in 1994, up from 15.61% in 1993 and 14.93% in 1992.  Late in 
1993, $47 million of common stock was issued through a Dividend Reinvestment and
Stock Purchase Plan.

The Corporation continues to pursue opportunities for profitable growth and 
asset diversification, with expansion in the states of Washington and Oregon a 
high priority.  An improved competitive position in Oregon resulted from the 
acquisition in 1994 of 10 branches of Far West Federal Savings Bank with 
deposits of $173 million, and National Security Bank Holding Company, a five 
branch institution on the Oregon coast with assets of $132 million.  Market 
penetration improved in the state of Washington with the acquisition of Valley 
Commercial Bank in 1994, a two branch institution serving Clarkston, Washington 
with assets of $64 million.  The acquisition of Idaho State Bank with assets of 
$48 million and seven branches in Idaho communities previously not served by the
Corporation was also completed in 1994.  Growth rates for 1992 and 1993 
reflected the acquisition in September 1992 of $1.2 billion in deposits from 
Security Pacific Corporation in the state of Washington (the Washington 
acquisition).

Regional Economic Performance
A financial institution's performance is directly influenced by economic 
conditions in its service area.  In 1994, strong economic conditions prevailed 
in the Corporation's service area of Idaho, Washington, Oregon and Utah.  Idaho
and Utah maintained exceptional levels of economic growth, and Oregon 
experienced increasingly stronger growth as 1994 progressed.  In recent years, 
Washington's growth was more moderate due to employment cuts in aerospace 
manufacturing; however, renewed economic strength and momentum were evident 
during the fourth quarter.  Utah and Idaho were two of the top three job 
producing states in the nation in 1993 and 1994, and total nonfarm employment 
growth in the four-state region totaled 3.3% in 1994 compared to a 3.1% gain 
nationally.  Individually, gains ranged from 2.1% in Washington to 5.8% in Utah.

Residential construction activity remained vigorous in 1994 with demand slowing 
late in the year as consumers in Idaho and Utah reacted to higher mortgage 
interest rates.  Strengthening economies in Oregon and Washington actually 
produced rising residential construction permit levels during the fourth quarter
despite the higher interest rates.  Dynamic economic conditions caused 
commercial office vacancy rates to decline sharply in Portland and Salt Lake 
City during 1994 and to remain flat at a very low level in Boise.  Vacancy rates
in Seattle were unchanged from the prior year.

Rising employment led to strong personal income gains in the region with 
inflation adjusted gains ranging from 3.2% in Washington to over 6% in Utah.  
The region remains a magnet for people from all over the United States, and all 
four states experienced substantial net inmigration during 1994.  Tighter labor 
markets in other regions of the United States and the prospect of a return to 
economic growth in California suggest that the rate of inmigration may slow in 
1995.  Higher interest rates will likely produce a decline in housing starts 
from the peaks experienced in 1994, but strong job growth suggests that economic
expansion will continue in the region in 1995.  Idaho's employment and income 
growth are expected to slow somewhat from the lofty levels of prior years, but 
employment growth of 3.5% and personal income growth of approximately 7.5% are 
projected for 1995, both well above national


                                       -15-


<PAGE>
benchmarks.  Expanded export markets combined with continued trade promotion 
efforts, aggressive new product development by high technology companies and 
national expansion by local retailers indicate Washington's economy will 
continue to improve in 1995.  Employment in Washington is expected to grow by 
2% while personal income should increase approximately 5.5% in 1995.  The 
technology sector in Oregon is expected to continue to expand in 1995, 
reflecting several large electronics projects announced in 1994.  As a result, 
employment growth of 2.6% and personal income growth of about 6.5% are 
projected for Oregon in 1995. In Utah, state projections indicate annual 
employment growth will be about 4.3% and personal income will grow
approximately 7.4%.

At December 31, 1994, shareholders' equity totaled $716 million, up 15% from a 
year ago.  The primary component of additional shareholders' equity in 1994 
was $89 million of retained earnings, up 32% from 1993.  At December 31, 1994,
shareholders' equity included a net unrealized after-tax loss of $13 million to 
adjust securities available for sale to market value.  Shareholders' equity as 
a percent of assets measures capital strength.  At December 31, 1994, the 
ratio was 8.14% compared to 8.13% at December 31, 1993 and 6.87% at December 
31, 1992.

In 1994, the Corporation paid dividends for the 60th consecutive year.  The 
dividend policy is designed to strike a balance between providing immediate 
returns to shareholders through cash dividends and increasing long-term
shareholders' value through profitable utilization of earnings as capital.  
In recognition of record net income and a strong capital position, the Board 
of Directors increased the quarterly dividend by 22% to $.22 per share in 
October 1994, representing the sixth consecutive year of dividend increases.
On a per share basis, dividends paid in 1994 were $.72, a 21% increase from 
$.595 in 1993.  The comparable dividend was $.51 in 1992.

The book value per share of common stock was $19.48 at December 31, 1994, an 8%
increase from the $17.96 book value per share at year-end 1993.  Market 
capitalization at December 31, 1994 was $974 million.  The Corporation's 
average annual compound return to shareholders was 22% for the five-year period
ended December 31, 1994 assuming reinvestment of dividends, significantly 
higher than the 8% return for a peer group of 503 commercial banks and the 
Nasdaq market index return of 6%.

The Corporation's stock was held by 6,957 shareholders of record at December 31,
1994 and is traded in the over-the-counter market on The Nasdaq Stock Market 
under the symbol of WEST.  The accompanying market quotations represent the high
and low closing sales price per share for the indicated periods as reported by

Financial institutions are subject to risk-based capital guidelines requiring 
minimum capital levels based on the perceived risk of assets and off-balance 
sheet instruments.  The Corporation's strong capital position, adequate 
allowance for credit losses, low intangible asset level and limited off-balance
sheet exposure resulted in capital ratios well above regulatory minimums as 
presented in the accompanying graph.  Bank regulators also adopted five capital
category definitions applicable to banks for certain regulatory supervision 
purposes, ranging from well-capitalized to critically undercapitalized.  At 
December 31, 1994, all banking subsidiaries exceeded the regulatory criteria for
well-capitalized institutions and qualified for the minimum FDIC insurance 
assessment. Dividends from subsidiaries to West One Bancorp are used to provide
capital to other subsidiaries, to reduce debt and to support shareholder 
dividends.  The Corporation's leverage, Tier I and total capital ratios were 
8.16%, 10.30% and 12.41%, respectively, at December 31, 1994 compared with 
7.61%, 9.53% and 11.80%, respectively, at December 31, 1993.

Double leverage is created when debt is incurred to acquire subsidiaries or to 
increase a subsidiary's capital and when intangible assets arise from 
acquisitions.  The double leverage ratio is calculated for West One Bancorp as 
the sum of investment in subsidiaries plus goodwill and core deposit intangibles
divided by total shareholders' equity.  Regulators have not specified a maximum
level of double leverage.  At December 31, 1994, the double leverage ratio 
improved to .94 compared to .98 and 1.11, respectively, at December 31, 1993 and
1992.

Net Interest Income
Net interest income is the Corporation's principal source of revenue and is 
comprised of interest income on earning assets minus interest expense on 
interest bearing liabilities.  Net interest margin is net interest income 
expressed as a percent of average earning assets and represents the difference 
between the yield on earning assets and the composite interest rate paid on all
sources of funds.  Net interest income is adjusted to a taxable equivalent 
basis to present income earned on taxable and tax-exempt assets on a comparable
basis.  References to net interest income and net interest margin in this 
discussion represent taxable equivalent amounts.

Net interest income is impacted primarily by changes in the volume and mix of 
earning assets and funding sources, market rates of interest and asset quality. 
Net interest income was $362.5 million in 1994, an increase of 12% from the 
prior year.  Comparable increases were 28% in 1993 and 20% in 1992.  Net 
interest income increased in 1994 due to an 11% increase in average earning 
assets and an 8 basis point improvement in net interest margin.  Net interest 
income accounted for 76% of total revenue in 1994 and 1993 and 75% in 1992.

Average earning assets increased $705 million or 11% to $7.32 billion in 1994 
following increases of 25% and 13% in 1993 and 1992, respectively.  The increase
in 1994 was attributable to average loan growth of $743 million due primarily 
to internal loan generation.  Acquisitions completed in 1994 contributed $35 
million of the average loan growth.  Loans represent the highest yielding 
component of earning assets and accounted for 77% of average earning assets in 
1994, up from 74% in 1993 and 71% in 1992.  Interest income foregone on 
nonperforming loans reduced net interest income by $1.0 million, net of tax, in
1994 compared to $1.1 million in 1993 and $1.7 million in 1992.  Nonaccrual 
loans declined to .32% of total loans at December 31, 1994 from .44% at year-end
1993 and .46% at year-end 1992.

A shift in the mix of sources of funds improved net interest income and net 
interest margin in 1994 as a significant increase in noninterest bearing funds 
allowed the Corporation to reduce its reliance on short-term borrowings.  
Average noninterest bearing funds increased to 17.5% of total sources of funds 
in 1994 from 15.5% in 1993, resulting in lower interest expense and a wider net
interest margin.  Average short-term borrowings were $831 million or 11.4% of 
total sources of funds in 1994 compared to $880 million or 13.3% in 1993.

Net interest margin increased 8 basis points to 4.95% in 1994 from 4.87% in 
1993.  Net interest margin was 4.76% in 1992.  The yield on earning assets and 
the cost of funds both increased in 1994, reflecting higher money market rates.
Improvements in the mix of both earning assets and sources of funds, combined 
with aggressive efforts to stabilize funding costs and to price loans 
profitably, resulted in a 17 basis point increase in the yield on earning assets
compared to a 9 basis point increase in the cost of sources of funds.  The 
accompanying table presents the rate and volume analysis of earnings assets and
interest bearing liabilities for the last three years.

Interest income is adjusted to present tax-exempt revenue from securities and 
loans on a basis comparable with taxable revenue, utilizing the statutory 
federal and the applicable state tax rates.

The taxable equivalent adjustments were $20,890 in 1994, $18,473 in 1993 and 
$13,125 in 1992.  Nonaccrual loans are included in average balances; however, 
interest income has not been accrued on such loans.  Net changes which are 
attributable to volume and rate are allocated proportionately.

Loans
Loans represent the Corporation's largest component of earning assets and, 
accordingly, are its primary source of income.  Loans totaled $6.07 billion at 
December 31, 1994, up from $5.35 billion at year-end 1993 and $4.53 billion at 
year-end 1992.  Loans increased 13% in 1994 compared to increases of 18% and
30% in 1993 and 1992, respectively.  Strong economic conditions in the 
Corporation's market area contributed to real estate loan growth of $376 million
or 17%, commercial and agricultural loan growth of $209 million or 10% and 
consumer loan growth of $134 million or 13%.  Residential real estate loans 
totaling an additional $194 million were originated and sold in the secondary 
market during 1994.  The average loan to deposit ratio was 89.60% in 1994 
compared to 86.18% in 1993 and 83.65% in 1992.  Nonperforming loans totaled $20
million at year-end 1994 and represented .32% of total loans as compared to .44%
in 1993 and .46% in 1992.

Real estate loans totaled $2.53 billion at December 31, 1994.  The largest 
component of the real estate loan portfolio is loans to individual homeowners 
collateralized by one-to-four family residential properties.  At $1.26 billion, 
residential real estate loans were 50% of total real estate loans at December 
31, 1994.  Residential real estate loans increased $162 million or 15% in 1994 
following increases of 23% and 46% in 1993 and 1992, respectively.  High rates 
of inmigration and the consolidation of consumer debt into tax-advantaged home 
equity credit lines contributed to the increase in 1994.

Commercial real estate loans increased $139 million or 17% to $946 million at  
December 31, 1994 compared to increases of 18% in 1993 and 47% in 1992.  The 
increase in 1994 represented loans to local business customers for expansion of 
operations and facilities in response to strong consumer demand for goods and 
services. More than 90% of the properties collateralizing commercial real estate
loans were located in the Corporation's local market area.  Underwriting 
standards typically rely on cash flow for repayment ability and not asset value
or appreciation.  The types of properties supporting commercial real estate 
loan obligations are well diversified.  In accordance with the Corporation's 
community banking strategy, loans collateralized by warehouse facilities and 
office buildings are primarily owner occupied and domiciled in our four-state 
market area.

Construction loans increased $74 million or 30% to $319 million at December 31, 
1994.  Dwelling units authorized in the Corporation's market area increased 16%
in 1994 due to an acceleration in single and multi-family residential 
construction.  Nonperforming real estate loans were $7.4 million at December 31,
1994 or 37% of total nonperforming loans and .3% of total real estate loans.

Commercial and agricultural loans totaled $2.21 billion at December 31, 1994, a 
$209 million or 10% increase from the prior year compared to increases of 12% 
in 1993 and 30% in 1992.  Commercial loans increased 11% to $1.78 billion in 
1994, reflecting improved regional economic conditions as measured by increases
in employment, population, personal income and retail sales.  Growth was 
primarily in the small-to-middle market where efficient and personal service is
provided by community-based lending officers.  Agricultural loans increased 9% 
to $429 million at December 31, 1994 as the Corporation maintained its position
as one of the leading agricultural lenders in the nation. At December 31, 1994,
nonperforming commercial and agricultural loans totaled $10.7 million or .5% of
commercial and agricultural loans.

Consumer loans increased 13% to $1.17 billion at December 31, 1994 following 
increases of 19% in 1993 and 10% in 1992.  Bankcard loans increased 9% to $232 
million in 1994 due to increases in merchants served and credit cards 
outstanding.  The remainder of the current year increase was primarily 
attributable to acquisitions completed in 1994.  Nonperforming consumer loans 
totaled $1.0 million at December 31, 1994.

Securities
The securities portfolio is comprised of investment quality, marketable debt 
securities.  Management's goal is to maximize long-term returns while 
maintaining an acceptable level of risk.

At December 31, 1994, the amortized cost of the securities portfolio totaled 
$1.74 billion, an increase of $131 million or 8% from December 31, 1993.  
The mix of securities changed over this time period as the portfolio was 
restructured to take advantage of rising interest rates.  Variable rate United
States Government agency securities increased $145 million and short-term United
States Treasury securities increased $82 million in 1994.  Mortgage-backed 
securities declined $55 million as maturing securities were not replaced and 
additional securities were sold due to unfavorable terms in a rising rate 
environment.

Debt securities the Corporation has the ability and intent to hold to maturity 
are reported at cost adjusted for the amortization of premiums and accretion of
discounts.  The aggregate cost of securities held to maturity at December

31, 1994 exceeded aggregate market value by $13 million.  Securities available 
for sale may be sold as part of the asset and liability management process and 
are reported at market value. Unrealized gains or losses related to the 
adjustment of these securities to market value are recorded net of tax as a 
component of shareholders' equity.  At December 31, 1994, the cost of 
securities available for sale exceeded market value by $21 million.

Sources of Funds
Earning assets are funded primarily by deposits acquired locally within the 
Corporation's four-state market area.  Deposits increased $874 million or 15% 
to $6.81 billion at December 31, 1994 following increases of 5% in 1993 and 39%
in 1992.  Approximately $355 million of the 1994 increase was attributable to 
acquisitions.  The increase in 1992 included the effect of the Washington 
acquisition.

Core deposits include all domestic deposits except time certificates $100 
thousand and over and are the primary funding source of earning assets.  Growth
in core deposits of $523 million or 10% to $6 billion accounted for most of the
deposit increase in 1994.  Core deposits represent stable funds from local 
customers and funded 76% of earning assets at year-end 1994, a very high 
level compared to industry averages.  Time certificates $100 thousand and 
over increased $351 million or 75% to $822 million at December 31, 1994.  
The increase occurred as depositors reduced liquid investments to take advantage
ofhigher interest rates.

Average total short-term borrowings as a percent of average earning assets 
declined to 11% in 1994 from 13% in 1993 and 14% in 1992.  Other short-term 
borrowings include United States Treasury borrowings, Federal Home Loan Bank 
borrowings  and commercial paper.  United States Treasury borrowings declined 
at December 31, 1994 compared to a year ago as less funds were available 
through the United States Treasury Tax and Loan Note Option Program.  These 
borrowings were replaced by Federal funds purchased, an alternative short-term 
source of funds.

Long-term debt was $253 million at December 31, 1994, an increase of $137 
million or 117% from December 31, 1993 due to an increase in Federal Home Loan 
Bank borrowings.  The Federal Home Loan Bank provides ready access to a stable,
low cost source of long-term advances secured by certain loans and investment 
securities.  At December 31, 1994,  four banking subsidiaries were members of 
the Federal Home Loan Bank and advances totaled $178 million.

Asset and Liability Management
Assets and liabilities are managed to maximize long-term shareholder returns by 
optimizing net interest income within the constraints of maintaining high 
credit quality, conservative interest rate risk policies and prudent levels of 
leverage and liquidity.  The Asset and Liability Committee meets regularly to 
monitor the composition of the balance sheet, to assess current and projected 
interest rate trends and to formulate strategies consistent with established 
objectives for liquidity, interest rate risk and capital adequacy.

Liquidity
The objective of liquidity management is to ensure the availability of 
sufficient cash flows to meet all financial commitments and to capitalize on 
opportunities for profitable business expansion.  Cash flows from operations 
contribute significantly to liquidity.  Borrowing represents an important and 
manageable source of liquidity based on the Corporation's ability to raise new 
funds and renew maturing liabilities in a variety of markets.  Liquidity is 
also obtained by maintaining assets that are readily convertible to cash at 
minimal cost through maturities and sales.  Contingency plans exist and could 
be implemented on a timely basis to minimize the risk associated with dramatic 
changes in market conditions. 

Deposits generated through the Corporation's extensive retail branch network 
are an important source of liquidity.  Deposits increased at a five-year annual
compound growth rate of 14%.  Core deposits, comprised of time certificates 
under $100 thousand and local market transaction and savings accounts, are 
highly reliable sources of funds.  At December 31, 1994, core deposits funded 
76% of earnings assets.  The Corporation is able to attract brokered deposits 
from outside its market area but does not rely on the deposits as a source of 
funds.  At December 31, 1994, brokered deposits totaled $68 million and funded 
only 1% of earning assets.

Securities available for sale totaled $1.14 billion at December 31, 1994 and 
represented a highly accessible source of liquidity.  Held to maturity 
securities will provide liquidity through maturities of $33 million in 1995.

Liquidity is also available through a variety of domestic money and capital 
markets.  Short-term borrowings provide a consistent source of funding and are 
comprised primarily of securities sold under agreements to repurchase, 

                                        -25-

<PAGE>
United States Treasury borrowings and Federal funds purchased.  Additional 
amounts of short-term funds are readily available in the form of commercial 
paper and bank notes.  At December 31, 1994, the Corporation had no outstanding
balances from either of these fund sources.  Back-up sources of liquidity are 
provided by credit lines available to West One Bancorp.  Bank subsidiaries in 
Idaho, Washington, Oregon and Utah have ready access to liquidity and matched 
funding from the Federal Home Loan Bank of Seattle.  Additional liquidity is 
available through borrowings from the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco.

The Corporation's investment grade ratings by Moody's and Standard and Poor's 
provide flexibility in meeting liquidity requirements through access to 
national markets.  Thomson BankWatch's issuer rating for West One Bancorp is "B"
and the short-term ratings of the Corporation and West One Bank, Idaho are 
"TBW-1," the highest rating available.

Asset liquidity also arises from loan repayments.  At December 31, 1994, 
scheduled principal payments due within one year were $2.18 billion or 36% of 
loans.  A majority of residential mortgage loan production is sold, 
contributing to overall liquidity.  In addition, portions of the residential 
mortgage, consumer and credit card loan portfolios could be securitized and 
sold to generate liquid assets.

Short-term investments averaged $65 million in 1994 and consisted of interest 
bearing deposits, Federal funds sold and securities purchased under agreements
to resell.  The investments provide flexibility in balancing the fluctuating 
volume requirements of customers with the Corporation's daily funding capacity.

In 1995, $40 million of long-term debt matures.  The debt obligations will be 
met through internally generated cash and additional external financing.  
Aggregate long-term debt maturities over the next five years total $201 million.
The liquidity requirements of West One Bancorp, primarily for dividends to 
shareholders, retirement of debt and other corporate purposes, are met 
principally through fees and regular dividends from subsidiaries.  Banking 
subsidiaries may declare dividends to West One Bancorp in 1995 up to $170 
million plus 1995 net income to the date of dividend declaration.

Interest Rate Risk
Interest rate risk refers to the exposure of earnings and capital arising from 
changes in interest rates.  Management's objectives are to control interest 
rate risk and to ensure predictable and consistent growth of earnings and 
capital.  Interest rate risk management focuses on fluctuations in net interest
income identified through computer simulations to evaluate volatility under 
varying interest rate, spread and volume assumptions.  The risk is quantified 
and compared against risk tolerance levels designed to maintain stability in 
net interest income.  Sensitivity analysis indicated that the Corporation was 
slightly liability sensitive and within established tolerance limits at 
December 31, 1994.

The Asset and Liability Maturity Repricing Schedule on the following page 
depicts variable rate instruments in the time period the balances are eligible 
for repricing and fixed rate instruments according to repayment schedules.  The
analysis provides a general measure of interest rate risk but does not address 
complexities such as prepayment risk, interest rate dynamics, interperiod 
sensitivities, interest rate floors and ceilings imposed on financial 
instruments, interest rate swaps and customers' responses to interest rate 
changes.

The Corporation's financial objectives are achieved by focusing on core 
business operations rather than by speculating on the direction and magnitude 
of interest rate fluctuations.  Exposure to adverse changes in interest rates 
arising in the normal course of business is managed through the occasional use 
of off-balance sheet instruments such as interest rate swaps.  At December 31, 
1994, the total notional value of all interest rate swap contracts outstanding 
was $535 million.  The interest rate swaps hedge interest rate risks associated
with certain prime-related assets and supporting deposits and are an integral 
part of the Corporation's interest rate risk management strategy.

Asset Quality
The provision for credit losses is the expense incurred to maintain an adequate 
allowance for anticipated credit losses.  Actual credit losses, net of 
recoveries of previously charged-off loans, are charged directly against the 
allowance.  The allowance for credit losses reflects management's current 
estimate of the amount required to absorb losses on existing loans and 
commitments to extend credit.  The determination of the appropriate level of 
the allowance is based on an analysis of various factors including historical 
loss experience based on volumes and types of loans; volumes and trends in 
delinquencies and nonaccruals; trends in portfolio volume, maturity and 
composition; results of internal or independent external credit reviews; 
industrial and geographical concentrations; and anticipated economic 
conditions.

Each affiliate regularly evaluates its allowance for credit losses.  Adequacy of
the allowance is subject to quarterly review by an executive committee and the 
audit committee of the Board of Directors.  Based on this analysis, management 
considers the allowance for credit losses to be adequate.

The Corporation's asset quality ratios ranked among the best in the industry in 
1994 and 1993.  Net charge-offs were $10.2 million or .18% of average loans in
1994 compared to $7.1 million or .14% of average loans in 1993.  In 1992, net 
charge-offs totaled $9.8 million or .26% of average loans.

Nonperforming assets declined 9% to $26 million at December 31, 1994 from $28 
million at year-end 1993.  At December 31, 1992, nonperforming assets were $31 
million.  As a percent of total assets, nonperforming assets were .29% at
December 31, 1994 compared to .37% a year ago and .44% at December 31, 1992.
Other credit risk assets include loans with serious concern, defined as loans
classified as doubtful but accruing interest, and accruing loans past due 90 
days or more.  At December 31, 1994, other credit risk assets, a precursor of 
problem loans, declined 74% to $1.3 million compared to $4.9 million a year ago.
At December 31, 1992, other credit risk assets totaled $6.6 million.

The provision for credit losses was $13.3 million in 1994 compared to $13.4 
million in 1993.  In 1992, the provision for credit losses was $14.3 million.  
The allowance for credit losses was $82 million at December 31, 1994, a 9% 
increase from $75 million a year ago. At December 31, 1992, the allowance for
credit losses was $68 million.  The allowance for credit losses represented 
1.35% of total loans at December 31, 1994 compared to 1.40% and 1.51% at 
year-ends 1993 and 1992, respectively.  The allowance for credit losses 
covered 412% of nonperforming loans at December 31, 1994.

Credit Risk
The Corporation's credit policies are designed to minimize losses.  The policies
require extensive evaluation of new requests for credit and continuing review of
existing credits to ensure early identification and monitoring of any evidence 
of deteriorating loan quality and quantification of possible loss.  A loan is 
placed on nonaccrual status when all or a portion of the interest is deemed
uncollectible.

Management believes that loan loss is best prevented by accurate initial 
assessment of new borrower risk, ongoing comprehensive review of the existing 
loan portfolio and immediate action once a problem becomes apparent.  Credit 
policies are consistent with this philosophy.  The Corporation employs a 
rigorous risk identification and problem loan management process combining the 
longtime practice of assigning responsibility to front line lenders for timely 
and accurate risk grading of loans with an effective problem loan early warning
system administered through the Credit Examination Department.  Once identified,
deteriorating loans are placed on the Watch List where they are subject to 
frequent and in-depth management review.  Credit risk management also includes 
pricing of loans to cover future credit losses, funding costs and servicing 
costs, and to allow for a profit margin.

The Corporation's objective is to maintain a loan portfolio that is diverse in 
terms of the types of loans and borrowers, industry concentration and geographic
distribution in an effort to minimize the adverse impact of individual events.  
At December 31, 1994, 46% of the Corporation's loans were in Idaho compared to 
81% in 1985.  Expansion in the states of Washington and Oregon has resulted in 
a significant improvement in the geographic

diversification of the loan portfolio.  The Corporation's market area has 
experienced some of the strongest economic conditions in the nation in recent 
years and the outlook continues to be favorable.  Economic conditions impact 
credit risk, however, and customers may be adversely impacted by a downturn in
the national economy.

Real estate loans accounted for 42% of total loans at December 31, 1994, 
significantly below industry averages.  Commercial loans, the second largest 
loan category, accounted for 29% of loans and included no significant industry
concentrations.  

Agricultural and related loans represented the largest single industry 
concentration in the loan portfolio, accounting for 7% of total loans at 
December 31, 1994.  The agricultural portfolio includes loans for diverse crops,
beef and dairy cattle, food processing, nursery stock, fisheries and equipment.
The average balance per commercial and agricultural loan was $92 thousand at 
December 31, 1994.

Foreign loans totaled $21 million or .35% of total loans at December 31, 1994.  
At year-end 1994, agreements to extend credit totaled $2.86 billion compared to 
$2.26 billion and $1.56 billion at year-ends 1993 and 1992, respectively.

Noninterest Income
Noninterest income includes revenue generated by fees, commissions and service 
charges to compensate for banking products and services.  Noninterest income 
increased $10.9 million or 11% to $113.4 million in 1994 following increases of 
23% in 1993 and 15% in 1992.  Excluding securities gains and losses, noninterest
income increased 12% in 1994.  Bankcard income improved in 1994 as the number of
merchants served and credit cards outstanding increased 15% and 20%, 
respectively.  Real estate servicing fees also improved in 1994 as loans 
serviced increased 34% to $3 billion.  The settlement of prior years' tax 
litigation resulted in $1.9 million of interest income from Federal income tax 
receivables.  The five-year compound growth rate for noninterest income, 
excluding securities gains and losses, was 17%, exceeding the five-year 
compound growth rate of 13% for assets.  

Noninterest Expense
Noninterest expense increased 8% to $294.7 million in 1994 compared with 
increases of 26% and 18% in 1993 and 1992, respectively.  Excluding the impact 
of 1994 acquisitions, noninterest expense increased 6% in 1994.  The current 
year increase included the costs of staffing and operating three new branches in
Idaho and Utah, the opening of six branches in supermarkets in Washington and 
Idaho, and technology. 

Noninterest expense as a percent of average earning assets improved to 4.03% in
1994 from 4.12% in 1993, comparing very favorably to industry averages.  The 
efficiency ratio improved to 61.78% in 1994 from 64.20% in 1993.  Management is
committed to improving earnings through the efficient allocation of human and
technological resources. These efforts included establishing an automated 
telephone voice response system providing immediate customer service seven days 
a week, 24 hours a day, in 1993.  The service currently averages 20,000 calls 
per day and resulted in staff reductions in retail branches. Successful 
implementation of a loan-by-phone product and a debit/point-of-sale card have 
also contributed to increased efficiency.

Income Taxes
Income tax planning plays a significant role in the maximization of long-term, 
after-tax profitability.  Income tax expense and the effective tax rate are 
impacted by the mix of taxable versus tax-exempt income from investment 
securities and loans.

The effective income tax rate was 29.9% in 1994 compared to 31.0% in 1993 and 
30.6% in 1992.  Note 14 to the financial statements reconciles the effective 
income tax rates to the Federal statutory rates.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

Note 1 SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

The accounting and reporting policies of West One Bancorp and its subsidiaries 
(West One) conform with generally accepted accounting principles and general 
practice in the banking industry.

Principles of Consolidation
The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of West One with 
elimination of material intercompany transactions and balances.  The Parent 
Company only financial statements (Note 16) reflect investment in subsidiaries 
using the equity basis of accounting. Certain reclassifications have been made 
to prior year financial statements to conform to the 1994 presentation. Assets 
owned by others and held in a fiduciary or agency capacity by subsidiaries are 
not included in the consolidated balance sheets.

Securities
On December 31, 1993, West One adopted Statement of Financial Accounting 
Standards (SFAS) No. 115, "Accounting for Certain Investments in Debt and 
Equity Securities."  Securities held to maturity are stated at cost, adjusted 
for amortization of premiums and accretion of discounts. Securities available 
for sale and trading account securities are stated at market value.  Gains and 
losses on sale of securities, recognized on a specific identification basis, 
and valuation adjustments of trading account securities are included in 
noninterest income.  Net unrealized gains and losses on securities available 
for sale are included, net of tax, as a component of shareholders' equity.

Loans
Loans and leases are stated at the principal amount outstanding, net of 
unearned income.  Interest on loans is recognized as income based on the 
outstanding principal and the stated interest rates as adjusted for net 
deferred loan fees, premiums and discounts.  Loan origination fees and costs 
are deferred and recognized as income on the interest method over the life of 
the loans.  Lease income, primarily from financing leases, is recognized on the 
interest method. Recognition of interest income is discontinued and all 
accrued, unpaid interest is reversed when a loan is placed on nonaccrual 
status.  A loan or lease is placed on nonaccrual status when timely collection 
of interest becomes doubtful. Interest payments received on nonaccrual loans 
and leases are applied to principal if collection of principal is doubtful or 
reflected as interest income on a cash basis. Loans and leases are removed from 
nonaccrual status when they are current and collectibility of principal and 
interest is no longer doubtful.  Loans held for sale are stated at the lower of 
cost or market.

Allowance for Credit Losses
The allowance for credit losses is maintained at a level considered adequate by 
management to provide for losses inherent in the portfolio of loans, leases and 
commitments to extend credit.  Loans sold with servicing released have 
technical underwriting exception and repurchase risks. Any loans repurchased 
are considered in the determination of the adequacy of the allowance for credit 
losses. The estimate of additions to the allowance for credit losses, and 
resulting charge to expense, requires judgment in evaluating the borrower's 
management, financial position, cash flow, collateral values and guarantees, as 
well as projection of the outcome of future events.  The continuing adequacy of 
the allowance for credit losses is determined based upon the results of a 
credit classification system, internal and external credit examinations, 
historic experience, economic conditions, industry concentrations, elements of  
risk and other loss factors affecting the quality of the loan portfolio.

Premises and Equipment
Premises, equipment, major improvements and replacements are stated at cost.  
Depreciation is recognized on the straight-line method over the estimated 
useful life of the asset.  Leasehold improvements are amortized over the  
shorter of the useful life of the asset or the remaining term of the lease.  
Gains or losses from disposal of premises and equipment are reflected in 
noninterest expense. Maintenance and repairs are expensed and improvements are  
capitalized. Costs of purchased and internally-developed software are amortized 
over periods up to five years.

                                        -38-


<PAGE>
Other Real Estate Owned
Other real estate owned consists principally of properties acquired through 
foreclosure and is stated at the lower of cost or market value. 

Other Assets
Other assets include goodwill and core deposit intangibles and are stated at 
cost, net of amortization provided on straight-line and level interest methods 
over useful lives ranging up to 25 years.  Purchased mortgage servicing rights 
are stated at cost, net of amortization based on the income method and 
prepayment assumptions.

Earnings per Share
Primary and fully diluted earnings per share are computed using the weighted 
average number of common and common equivalent shares outstanding. Common 
equivalent shares result from the assumed exercise of outstanding stock 
options, if dilutive.  Fully diluted earnings per share assumes conversion of 
the convertible debentures, if dilutive.

New Pronouncements
The Financial Accounting Standards Board has issued SFAS No. 114, "Accounting 
by Creditors for Impairment of a Loan," SFAS No. 116, "Accounting for 
Contributions Received and Contributions Made" and SFAS No. 118, "Accounting 
by  Creditors for Impairment of a Loan - Income Recognition and Disclosures,"
effective for years beginning after December 15, 1994. None of these 
statements is expected to have a material effect on West One.

        
NOTE 2. ACQUISITIONS         

West One acquired the financial institutions listed below in transactions 
accounted for as poolings of interests.  The acquisitions were not material to 
West One's financial position, results of operations and cash flows and prior 
year financial statements have not been restated.

The average balance is computed on a daily average method.  The average rate is 
computed by dividing total interest expense by the average outstanding balance. 

Other short-term borrowings consist of United States Treasury borrowings and    
bank notes. Unused lines of credit aggregating $45,000 at December 31, 1994 
were maintained with banks in support of commercial paper. The lines bear 
interest at short-term money market rates, if drawn upon.  The lines required 
commitment fees of $83, $84, and  $76 in 1994, 1993 and 1992, respectively.

NOTE 9. COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES

West One is a party to certain financial instruments to meet the financing 
needs of customers and to reduce exposure to interest rate risk.  The following 
is a summary of the contract or notional amount of these financial instruments, 
all of which were held or issued for purposes other than trading, as of 
December 31.

</TABLE>

 (a) Commitments to extend credit have fixed maturity dates and represent West 
One's obligations to fund commercial and real estate loans, including home 
equity lines, lines of credit, revolving lines of credit and other types of 
commitments. Letters of credit are performance assurances of customer 
obligations or guarantees of financing for trade transactions. West One's 
exposure to credit loss for commitments to extend credit and letters of credit, 
in the event of nonperformance by others, is represented by the contractual 
amount of the instruments. Since many commitments to extend credit are expected 
to expire without being drawn upon, the total commitments do not necessarily 
represent future cash requirements. West One follows the same credit policies 
in making commitments and conditional obligations as it does for on-balance 
sheet instruments. Collateral varies, but may include accounts receivable, 
inventory, premises and equipment and commercial properties.  West One's 
lending activities are concentrated in Idaho, Washington, Oregon and Utah.

(b) The forward sales  and purchased options are contracts to buy or sell 
mortgage-backed securities to hedge interest rate risk on fixed rate mortgage 
loan or rate commitments.  Net positions are valued at the lower of cost or 
market.  Gains or losses are recognized upon settlement of the forward sale 
contracts based on the difference between the net sales proceeds and the net 
carrying value of the loans sold.  The option premium paid, which represents 
loss exposure, is amortized over the life of the option.

Interest rate swaps are principally used to hedge interest rate risks 
associated with certain loans and deposits and are accounted for on the accrual 
method of accounting.  The principal swap, which matures in 1999, requires 
payment of prime less 2.535% and receipt of the three month London Interbank 
Offering Rate (LIBOR) with caps, which increase 25 basis points per quarter, on 
the notional amount of $500,000.

The credit and market risks associated with forward sale and purchased option 
contracts and interest rate swaps arise from the possible inability of 
counterparties to meet the terms of the contracts and from fluctuations in 
securities' values and interest rates.  West One limits credit risk by 
restricting counterparties to a list of approved institutions. Generally, West 
One does not require collateral for these types of instruments.

(c) The credit and market risks associated with foreign exchange contracts, 
which may arise from the counterparty's inability to make payment at the 
settlement date and fluctuations in value of a foreign currency in relation to 
the U.S. dollar, were nominal at December 31, 1994 and 1993. 

West One is a defendant in various pending lawsuits, arising in the ordinary 
course of business, none of which are expected to have a material effect on 
West One's financial position or results of operations.

NOTE 10. SHAREHOLDERS' EQUITY   

Authorized capital stock of West One  consists of 75,000,000 shares of $1.00 
par value common stock and 5,000,000 shares of $1.00 par value preferred stock, 
of which 150,000 preferred shares are reserved for issuance under the 
Shareholder Rights Plan.

At December 31, 1994 and 1993 securities available for sale were stated at 
market and the resulting net after-tax unrealized loss of $12,896 and gain of 
$9,083, respectively are presented as a component of shareholders' equity. 

On October 19, 1989 the Board of Directors adopted a Shareholder Rights Plan. 
Under the terms of the Plan, the Board declared a dividend distribution of one 
Right for each share of common stock outstanding on October 31, 1989, or at 
specified times thereafter.  When initially issued each Right entitled the 
registered holder to purchase from West One a unit consisting of one-hundredth 
of a share of Series A Junior Participating Preferred Stock at a purchase price 
of $150 per unit, subject to adjustment.

The Rights will become exercisable upon the occurrence of specified events 
which could result in a change in control of West One or upon the determination 
by the Board that an Adverse Person (as defined) beneficially owns 10 percent 
or more of the outstanding common stock.  Once the Rights become exercisable, 
if the Board determines that a person is an Adverse Person or a person becomes 
the owner of 25 percent or more of the then-outstanding shares of common stock 
(with certain exceptions), each holder of a Right (other than an Acquiring 
Person (as defined) or an Adverse Person) will thereafter become entitled to 
receive, upon payment of the exercise price, common stock (or in certain 
circumstances other consideration) having a value equal to two times the 
exercise price or, at the discretion of the Board, to receive common stock (or 
other consideration) having one-half that value without payment of the exercise 
price.  The Rights are nonvoting, may be redeemed by West One at a price of 
$.01 per Right at any time until ten business days after an individual or group 
acquires 20 percent of West One's common stock and expire on October 31, 1999.  
The issuance of the Rights is intended to encourage any potential acquirer of 
West One to negotiate the manner and terms of  the transaction with the Board 
and to protect shareholders from unsolicited tender offers which do not treat 
all shareholders in a fair and equal manner, and from other coercive takeover 
tactics. 

Under shareholder approved incentive programs, the Board of Directors may grant 
to key employees options to purchase common stock and other stock-based awards. 
All options are to be granted at market value of the stock at date of grant and 
may be exercisable over periods up to ten years.  The following summary sets 
forth the activity under the option plan:

</TABLE>
   
Financial assets and financial liabilities other than securities and certain 
long-term debt of West One are not traded in active markets. Estimated fair 
values require subjective judgments and are approximate.  The above estimates 
of fair value are not necessarily representative of amounts that could be 
realized in actual market transactions, nor of the underlying value of West 
One.  The value of long-term relationships with depositors (core deposit 
intangibles) is not reflected and such value is significant. Changes in the 
following methodologies and assumptions could significantly affect the 
estimates. 

Financial Assets 
The estimated fair value of cash and short-term investments approximates the 
book value.  For securities, the fair value is based on quoted market prices at 
December 31.  The fair value of loans is estimated by discounting future cash 
flows using current rates at which similar categories of loans would be made, 
net of the present value of estimated net charge-offs. 

Financial Liabilities 
The estimated fair value of demand and savings deposits approximates book 
value. The fair value of time certificates of deposit is estimated by 
discounting future cash flows using current rates offered on similar 
certificates.  For short-term borrowings, the fair value approximates book 
value.  The estimated fair value of long-term debt is based on quoted market 
prices or estimates of discounted cash flows using current rates at which 
similar financing could be obtained.

Off-balance Sheet Financial Instruments 
Commitments to extend credit, letters of credit and interest rate swaps 
represent the  principal categories of off-balance sheet financial instruments. 
See Note 9 to the financial statements.  The fair value of West One's 
commitments to extend credit, letters of credit, forward sale, purchased option 
and foreign exchange contracts are not material.  The interest rate swaps hedge 
interest rate risks associated with certain prime-related assets and supporting 
deposits as a part of West One's interest rate risk management strategy.  The 
present value of the interest rate swaps using discounted cash flows and 
assuming interest rates at December 31, 1994 remain constant is a liability of 
$4.3 million. Based on implied forward interest rates at December 31, 1994, an 
exit cost (fair value) of $34.9 million would be incurred to terminate the 
contracts.  These contracts are part of a continuing asset and liability risk 
management strategy, and West One currently has no intent to exit the 
contracts.

NOTE 12. EMPLOYEE BENEFITS

West One has a noncontributory defined benefit retirement plan covering 
substantially all employees. Benefits to retired employees are based on years 
of service and compensation. West One funds at least the minimum annual 
contributions required by the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974.  
Since plan assets exceeded accumulated benefit obligation, no additional 
funding was made in 1994, 1993 or 1992. 

Pension (income) expense included the following components for the
year ended December 31:

West One also has three unfunded supplemental retirement plans.  The 
Supplemental Executive Retirement Plan provides supplemental benefits to 
eligible employees when the employee's earnings exceed the dollar amount used 
for the definition of a highly compensated employee in the Internal Revenue 
Code (IRC) Section 414 (q) (1) (B) during each of the three preceding years. 
The Non-Qualified IRC 415 Benefit Limit Make-Up plan provides for additional 
payments to be made to employees whose defined pension benefit exceeds the 
limit for maximum benefits from the defined benefit pension plan.  The 
Executive Deferred Compensation Pension Make-Up plan covers pension benefits 
resulting from salary deferrals which have not been included in the computation 
of benefits under the regular defined benefit pension plan.

Pension expense for the supplemental retirement plans included the following 
for the year ended December 31:

A change in method for determining the market-related value of plan assets 
decreased pension expense $313 in 1994.  The change in salary increase 
assumption increased pension income by  $319 in 1993. Changes in the assumed 
participant withdrawal rates increased pension income $789 in 1992. 

West One has an Employee Thrift Investment Plan, under IRC Section 401, 
covering substantially all employees.  Under the plan, West One made 
contributions of 50% of participating employees' salary deferrals up to 6% of 
salary in 1994 and 1993, and 5% of salary in 1992 aggregating $2,744 for 1994, 
$2,384 for 1993 and $1,566 for 1992. 

West One provides certain health care insurance benefits for retired employees 
and their dependents (postretirement benefits).  Substantially all of West 
One's retirees are eligible for those benefits if they retired directly from 
service with at least ten years of credited service.  Retiree contributions are 
required depending on age and number of years of service at the time of 
retirement.

In 1994 West One assumed a 13% annual rate of increase in the per capita cost 
of covered retiree and dependent health care benefits.  The medical trend rate 
was assumed to decrease gradually to 6% in 2006 and remain at that level for 
future years. A one percentage point increase in the assumed health care cost 
trend rate would increase the accumulated postretirement benefit obligation at 
December 31, 1994 by $1,107 and the aggregate of the service cost and interest 
cost components of net periodic postretirement benefit expense for 1994 by 
$153.  

The discount rate used in determining the actuarial present value of the 
projected postretirement benefit obligation was 8.75%. The salary limits which 
determine the amount of the deductible paid by the employee were assumed to 
increase in proportion to West One salary levels.

A subsidiary has preacquisition net operating loss carryforwards remaining of 
$1,954 which expire through 2008. 

The corporation recorded tax benefits of $1,332, $475 and $812 for executive 
stock option exercises in 1994, 1993 and 1992, respectively.  The tax benefits 
have been allocated to shareholders' equity.  In 1994 the deferred benefit for 
income taxes of $13,319 for unrealized securities losses has been allocated to 
shareholders' equity. 

Deferred tax liabilities of $2,133 have not been recognized for a thrift 
subsidiary's base year tax bad debt reserve of $5,359.  If the subsidiary fails 
to qualify as a savings and loan association or is converted to a commercial 
bank, the bad debt reserve would become taxable.  Management does not expect 
this difference to reverse in the foreseeable future. 


NOTE 15.  REGULATORY REQUIREMENTS AND RESTRICTIONS

Regulatory authorities require banks to maintain cash reserves against 
deposits.  These reserves vary according to the type and maturity of the 
deposit.  Cash reserve balances at December 31, 1994 and 1993 were $152,312 and 
$144,998, respectively. 

Federal and state laws place limitations on the extension of credit by banking 
subsidiaries to the Parent Company and nonbank affiliates.  Under these 
restrictions, banking subsidiaries may not extend credit beyond an aggregate of 
$100,475 to the Parent Company and nonbank affiliates as of December 31, 1994.  
Any extensions of such credit are subject to strict collateral requirements.  

Federal and state laws also restrict the amount of dividends that may be 
declared by banking subsidiaries without the approval of regulatory 
authorities.  Banking subsidiaries may declare dividends to the Parent Company  
in 1995 up to $170,440 plus 1995 net income to the date of dividend 
declaration. 

Credit extensions to directors, executive officers and their associates, which 
are within regulatory limitations, are as follows:

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT ACCOUNTANTS

To the Shareholders and Directors of West One Bancorp

We have audited the consolidated balance sheets of West One Bancorp and 
subsidiaries as of December 31, 1994 and 1993, and the related consolidated 
statements of income, shareholders' equity and cash flows for each of the three 
years in the period ended December 31, 1994.  These financial statements are 
the responsibility of management.  Our responsibility is to express an opinion 
on these financial statements based on our audits.

We conducted our audits in accordance with generally accepted auditing 
standards.  Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to 
obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of 
material misstatement.  An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence 
supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements.  An audit 
also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant 
estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial 
statement presentation.  We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis 
for our opinion.

In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present fairly, in 
all material respects, the consolidated financial position of West One Bancorp 
and subsidiaries as of December 31, 1994 and 1993 and the consolidated results 
of their operations and their cash flows for each of the three years in the 
period ended December 31, 1994, in conformity with generally accepted 
accounting principles.

As discussed in Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements, during 1993 
the Company adopted Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 115, 
"Accounting for Certain Investments in Debt and Equity Securities."
