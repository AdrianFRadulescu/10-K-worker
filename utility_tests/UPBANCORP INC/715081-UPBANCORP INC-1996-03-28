                               ITEM 1: BUSINESS

UPBANCORP, INC.


     Upbancorp, Inc. ("Upbancorp" or the "Company") is a multi-bank holding 
company organized in 1983 under the laws of the State of Delaware. Upbancorp 
owns all the outstanding common stock of Uptown National Bank of Chicago 
("Uptown"), organized in 1929 and located in Chicago, Illinois and Heritage 
Bank ("Heritage"), organized in 1977 and located in Phoenix, Arizona. (Uptown 
and Heritage are referred to as the "Subsidiary Banks"). Upbancorp does not 
engage in any activities other than providing administrative services and 
acting as a holding company for its Subsidiary Banks.


     The Company is a publicly traded banking company with total assets of 
$206 million at year-end 1995 and is headquartered in Chicago, Illinois. The 
majority of the operational responsibilities of each of the Subsidiary Banks 
rests with their Officers and Directors.


     The Company and its Subsidiary Banks employed approximately 148 
full-time equivalent employees at December 31, 1995. The Company is an equal 
opportunity employer and its affirmative action programs comply with 
applicable federal laws and executive orders.

SUBSIDIARY BANKS

     The Company's affiliates consist of two full-service community banks, 
which operate five banking offices in northern Chicago and metropolitan 
Phoenix. Approximately 81% of its banking assets are related to Uptown with 
the remainder at Heritage.

     Both Subsidiary Banks are engaged in the general commercial banking 
business in addition to offering a complete range of retail banking services. 
The Subsidiary Banks conduct a general banking business which embraces all of 
the usual functions, both commercial and consumer, and which they may 
lawfully provide, including, but not limited to: the acceptance of deposits 
to demand, savings and time accounts and the servicing of such accounts; 
commercial, industrial, consumer and real estate lending; collections; safe 
deposit box operations; and other banking services tailored for both 
commercial and retail clients.


     Uptown has one wholly-owned subsidiary, Broadway Clark Building 
Corporation ("BCBC"), which is an Illinois corporation. BCBC owns all of the 
real estate that is used in connection with the operation of Uptown's 
business with the exception of one facility at 5345 N. Sheridan Road, which 
is leased. The business operations of Uptown Safe Deposit Company ("SDC"), 
which formally rented vault space and safe deposit boxes to Uptown and the 
general public, were acquired by Uptown effective January 1, 1996.

                         SUPERVISION AND REGULATION

     The Company and its Subsidiary Banks are subject to regulation and 
supervision by various governmental regulatory authorities including, but not 
limited to, the Federal Reserve Board (the "FRB"), the Office of the 
Comptroller of the Currency (the "OCC"), the Federal Deposit Insurance 
Corporation (the "FDIC"), the Arizona State Banking Department, the 
Securities and Exchange Commission (the "SEC"), the Internal Revenue Service 
and state taxing authorities. Financial institutions and their holding 
companies are extensively regulated under federal and state law. The effect 
of such statutes, regulations and policies can be significant and cannot be 
predicted with a high degree of certainty.

     Federal and state laws and regulations generally applicable to financial 
institutions, such as the Company and the Subsidiary Banks, regulate, among 
other things, the scope of business, investments, reserves against deposits, 
capital levels relative to operations, the nature and amount of collateral 
for loans, the establishment of branches, mergers, consolidations and 
dividends. This supervision and regulation is intended primarily for the 
protection of the FDIC's Bank Insurance Fund and the depositors, rather than 
the shareholders of financial institutions.

     The Company is subject to supervision and regulation by the Board of 
Governors of the Federal Reserve System, the FRB, under the Bank Holding 
Company Act of 1956, as amended.


                                                                              3
<PAGE>


     Uptown is chartered under the National Bank Act, as amended, and is 
subject to the examination, supervision, reporting and enforcement 
requirements of the OCC, as the chartering authority for national banks, and 
the FDIC as the administrator of the Bank Insurance Fund. The Bank is a 
member of the Federal Reserve System.


     Heritage is chartered under the banking laws of Arizona and is subject 
to the examination, supervision, reporting and enforcement requirements of 
the Arizona State Banking Commission under the banking laws of Arizona and 
the  FDIC under the Federal Deposit Insurance Act, as amended.

     The deposits of the Subsidiary Banks are insured by the Bank Insurance 
Fund of the FDIC to the extent permitted by law.

     The Company's common stock is registered with the SEC under the 
Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, 
as amended. Consequently, the Company is subject to the information proxy 
solicitation, insider trading and other restrictions and requirements of the 
SEC under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934.

     The following references to material statutes and regulations affecting 
the Company and its subsidiaries are brief summaries thereof and are 
qualified in their entirety by reference to such statutes and regulations. 
Any change in applicable laws or regulations may have a material effect on 
the business of the Company and its subsidiaries.

RIEGLE-NEAL INTERSTATE BANKING AND BRANCHING EFFICIENCY ACT OF 1994


     On September 29, 1994, the Riegle-Neal Interstate Banking and Branching 
Efficiency Act was signed into law. This federal law effectively eliminated 
the state law barriers to interstate banking and branching - laws that 
previously had been left to the domain of the states. The new law will be 
phased in over a two year period beginning in 1995.

                              INTERSTATE BANKING

     Illinois bank holding companies are permitted to acquire banks and bank 
holding companies, and be acquired by bank holding companies located in any 
state which authorizes such acquisitions under qualifications and conditions 
which are not unduly restrictive, as determined by the Commissioner of 
Illinois, when compared to those imposed under Illinois law. Under recently 
enacted interstate banking legislation, adequately capitalized and managed 
bank holding companies are permitted to acquire control of a bank in any 
state. These acquisitions are subject to approval by the various states in 
addition to the FRB, based on specific criteria, such as: the number of years 
the bank has been in existence and concentration limits both nationwide and 
within the state.

                             INTERSTATE BRANCHING

     Recently enacted interstate branching legislation permits (effective 
June 1, 1997) banks to merge across state lines, thereby creating a main bank 
in one state with branches in other states. States may "opt-in" prior to the 
effective date or may "opt-out" of interstate branching transactions. Once 
state law is established, approval of interstate bank mergers will be subject 
to certain conditions: adequate capitalization; adequate management; 
Community Reinvestment Act compliance; specific deposit concentration limits; 
and compliance with federal and state antitrust laws. An interstate merger 
transaction may involve the acquisition of a branch without the acquisition 
of the bank only if the law of the state in which the branch is located 
permits out-of-state banks to acquire a branch of a bank in that state 
without acquiring the bank. Following the consummation of an interstate 
transaction, the resulting bank may establish additional branches at any 
location where any bank involved in the transaction could have established a 
branch under applicable federal or state law, if such bank had not been a 
party to the merger transaction.

     The effects on the Company of such recent changes in interstate banking 
and branching laws cannot be accurately predicted, but it is likely that 
there will be increased competition from national and regional banking firms.

BANK HOLDING COMPANY ACT OF 1956, AS AMENDED

     A bank holding company is subject to regulations under the Bank Holding 
Company Act of 1956, as amended (the "Act"), and must register with the FRB 
under that Act. A bank holding company is required by the Act to file an 
annual report of its operations and such additional information as the FRB 
may require and is subject, along with its subsidiaries, to examination by 
the FRB. The FRB has jurisdiction to regulate the terms of certain debt 
issues of bank holding companies including the authority to impose reserve 
requirements. In addition, the Act regulates acquisitions of assets of other 
banks along with the purchase of non-bank entities within specific guidelines.

FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS REFORM, RECOVERY AND ENFORCEMENT ACT OF 1989

     The passage of the Financial Institutions Reform, Recovery and 
Enforcement Act of 1989 ("FIRREA") resulted in significant changes in the 
enforcement powers of federal banking agencies, and more significantly, the 
manner in which the thrift industry is regulated. While FIRREA's primary 
purpose was to address public concern over the financial crises of the thrift 
industry through the imposition of strict reforms on that industry, FIRREA 
grants bank holding companies more expansive rights of entry into "the 
savings institution" market through the acquisition of both healthy and 
failed savings institutions. Under the provision of FIRREA, a bank holding 
company can expand its geographic market or increase its concentration in an 
existing market by acquiring a savings institution, regardless of its 
financial condition or concentration levels, but it cannot expand its product 
market by acquiring a savings institution.


     Under FIRREA, a depository institution insured by the FDIC can be held 
liable for any loss incurred by, or reasonably expected to be incurred by, 
the FDIC in connection with (i) the default of a commonly controlled 
FDIC-insured depository institution or (ii) any assistance provided by the 
FDIC to a commonly controlled FDIC-insured depository institution in danger 
of default (the "Cross Guarantee"). "Default" is defined generally as the 
appointment of a conservator or receiver and "in danger of default" is 
defined generally as the existence of certain conditions indicating either 
that there is no reasonable prospect that the institution will be able to 
meet the demands of its depositors or pay its obligations in the absence of 
regulatory assistance, or that its capital has been depleted and there is no 
reasonable prospect that it will be replenished in the absence of regulatory 
assistance. The Cross Guarantee thus enables the FDIC to assess a bank 
holding company's healthy Bank Insurance Fund members for the losses of any 
of such bank holding company's failed Bank Insurance Fund members.  Cross 
Guarantee liabilities are generally superior in priority to obligations of 
the depository institution to its shareholders due solely to their status as 
shareholders and obligations to other affiliates.

FEDERAL DEPOSIT INSURANCE CORPORATION IMPROVEMENT ACT OF 1991

     On December 19, 1991, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation 
Improvement Act of 1991 (the "FDIC Improvement Act") was signed into law. The 
regulatory framework of the FDIC Improvement Act introduced a comprehensive 
and fundamentally changed approach to banking supervision, generally 
subjecting banking institutions to significantly increased regulation and 
supervision. Some of the provisions contained in the FDIC Improvement Act 
include the implementation of a risk-related premium system for FDIC-insured 
deposits, revisions in the process of supervision and examination for 
depository institutions, and federal deposit insurance reforms. Selected 
provisions of the FDIC Improvement Act are summarized below:

                             FDIC INSURANCE PREMIUMS


     During 1993, the final rule for implementing the FDIC's Risk Related 
Premium System ("RRPS") was issued. Under the RRPS, financial institutions 
are placed into capital groups and supervisory subgroups. The three capital 
groups, which are based upon the institution's risk-based (tier 1 and total) 
and leverage capital ratios defined the institution as "well-capitalized", 
"adequately capitalized" or "under-capitalized". The institution's 
supervisory subgroup classification is based upon the composite rating that 
is assigned and communicated to the institution in writing by its primary 
federal regulator. Based upon a combination of the capital group and 
supervisory subgroup classifications, the institution is assessed a deposit 
insurance assessment rate, as revised in January 1996,  ranging from $.00 to 
$.27 for every $100 of insured deposits.

     In June, 1995, the Bank Insurance Fund reached a required 1.25% of total 
estimated insured deposits. Premiums were refunded in September, 1995, to all 
banks contributing to the premium system for a four month period to reduced 
premium rates ranging, at that time, from $.04 to $.31 for every $100 of 
insured deposits.



                                                                              5
<PAGE>

                           DEPOSIT INSURANCE CHANGES

     Deposit insurance changes promulgated by the FDIC Improvement Act impose 
new limits on uninsured deposits that had previously received de facto 
protection under the "too big to fail" policy. The FDIC Improvement Act 
retains the $100,000 deposit insurance limit, and precludes payment to any 
uninsured depositors in excess of $100,000 per depositor. Multiple accounts 
require the same aggregation method as was contained in the previous law, 
which is that only those deposits maintained in the "same capacity and the 
same right" for the benefit of the depositor in his or any other name are 
considered amounts due to one depositor. Another deposit insurance change 
includes the requirement that the FDIC's resolution of failed institutions be 
accomplished in the least costly manner.


     Accordingly, in the case of the sale by the FDIC of substantially all of 
a failed institution's assets, subject to its liabilities, the FDIC would be 
required to compare the cost of alternative resolution transactions with the 
cost of paying insured depositors and liquidating the institution. After 
December 31, 1994, the FDIC Improvement Act prohibits the FDIC from taking 
any action that would have the effect of increasing losses to the Bank 
Insurance Fund by protecting uninsured depositors and creditors of failed 
institutions.

     Non-capital safety and soundness standards for banks were also 
established through the FDIC Improvement Act, the failure of which would 
trigger regulatory actions against the financial institution, possibly 
including restrictions on asset growth or the imposition of the requirement 
for higher tangible capital. These standards include operational and 
managerial standards, asset quality and earnings standards, and compensation 
standards. Known as "tripwire" standards, any bank that fails to comply with 
these standards would be required to file a compliance plan with its primary 
regulators detailing how the bank will achieve compliance.

     As a result of the FDIC Improvement Act and other new regulations and 
guidelines that followed, regulatory agencies are placing greater emphasis on 
the responsibilities of management and the board of directors in addition to 
increased emphasis on their compliance examinations. It is anticipated that 
this direction will continue and recent emphasis of laws and regulations will 
not shift in the near future.

           GOVERNMENTAL MONETARY POLICIES AND ECONOMIC CONDITIONS

     The earnings of the Company are affected in important respects by 
general economic conditions and also by the fiscal and monetary policies of 
the Federal Government and its agencies. In particular, the FRB regulates the 
national supply of bank credit in order to achieve, among other things, 
maximum employment and a stable price level. Among the instruments of 
monetary policy used by the FRB to implement these objectives are: open 
market transactions in United States government securities, changes in the 
discount rate on member bank borrowings and changes in reserve requirements 
against member bank deposits. These means are used in varying combinations to 
influence overall growth of bank loans, investments, and deposits, and they 
may also affect interest rates charged on loans or paid for deposits.

     In addition to the FRB, the Company's earnings are also affected by the 
FDIC insurance premiums and the annual fees charged by the various regulatory 
authorities. The Company cannot fully predict the nature or the extent of any 
effect which such fiscal and monetary policies may have on its business and 
earnings.

                                 COMPETITION

     The principal methods of competition between commercial banks is 
generally expressed in terms of price, including interest rates paid on 
deposits and interest rates charged on borrowings, fees charged on fiduciary 
services, quality of services to customers, ease of access to services, and 
the offering of additional services. More recently, technological advances 
such as telebanking, point-of-sale debit cards and electronic data 
interchange have also resulted in intensified competition with traditional 
banking distribution systems.

     Both Illinois and Arizona are highly competitive markets for banking and 
related financial services. Since these areas are the Company's primary focus 
markets, the Subsidiary Banks are exposed to varying types and levels of 
competition. In general, each Subsidiary Bank competes, anticipates and 
responds within each individual market area. Both Subsidiary Banks compete 
and rely heavily on the high level of quality service provided to our 
customers. The Company has seen the level of competition and number of 



6
<PAGE>

competitors in its market places increase in recent years and expects a 
continuation of these competitive market conditions.

                             CAPITAL GUIDELINES

     The FRB, the OCC and the FDIC have adopted risk-based capital guidelines 
to provide a framework for assessing the adequacy of the capital of banks and 
bank holding companies (collectively "banking institutions"). These 
guidelines, which became effective in their current form on December 31, 
1992, apply to all banking institutions regardless of size and are used in 
the examination and supervisory process as well as in the analysis of 
applications to be acted upon by the regulatory authorities. These guidelines 
require banking institutions to maintain capital based on the credit risk of 
their operations.

     The risk-based capital guidelines are designed to require the 
maintenance of capital commensurate with both on and off-balance sheet credit 
risks. The minimum ratios established by the guidelines are based on both 
tier 1 and total capital to total risk-based assets. Total risk-based assets 
are calculated by assigning each on-balance sheet asset and off-balance sheet 
item to one of four risk categories depending on the nature of each item. The 
amount of the items in each category is then multiplied by the risk-weight 
assigned to that category (0%, 20%, 50% or 100%). Total risk-based assets 
equals the sum of the resulting amounts. Tier 1 capital is generally defined 
as shareholders' equity less intangible assets and total capital is generally 
defined to include Tier 1 capital plus limited levels of the allowance for 
loan losses.

     In addition to the risk-based capital requirements, the FRB, the OCC and 
the FDIC require institutions to maintain a minimum leveraged-capital ratio 
to supplement the risk-based capital guidelines. The leverage ratio is 
intended to ensure that adequate capital is maintained against risks other 
than credit risk.

     During 1994, the federal banking regulators announced a joint decision 
not to modify risk-based capital and leverage requirements for regulatory 
capital to reflect the impact of unrealized holding gains and losses for 
securities classified as available-for-sale. This decision, which was largely 
the result of regulatory and industry concerns about resulting volatility in 
regulatory capital ratios, was made in response to the Financial Accounting 
Standards Board's ("FASB") issuance of Statement of Financial Accounting 
Standards ("SFAS") No. 115 "Accounting for Certain Investments in Debt and 
Equity Securities".

     The Company and the Subsidiary Banks exceed the minimum required capital 
guidelines for both risk-based capital ratios and the leverage ratio at 
December 31, 1995. A further discussion of the capital guidelines is included 
in the Capital Resources section under Item 7 of this Form 10-K.

                                   DIVIDENDS
GENERAL

     In addition to the capital guidelines provided in the discussion above, 
there are various national and state banking regulations which limit the 
ability of the Subsidiary Banks to pay dividends and thereby limiting the 
Company to pay dividends. Since the Company is a legal entity, separate and 
distinct from its affiliates, its dividends are not subject to such bank 
regulatory guidelines. The holders of the Company's common stock are entitled 
to receive such dividends as are declared by the Board of Directors. For a 
further discussion of dividends, please see the footnote entitled 
"Statutory/Regulatory Restrictions" in the Notes to Consolidated Financial 
Statements found elsewhere in this Form 10-K.

     In June, 1992, at the request of the Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago 
("Reserve Bank"), the Company's Directors adopted a resolution that requires 
the Company to notify the Reserve Bank in writing 30 days prior to the 
declaration of dividends, and obtain prior written approval of the Reserve 
Bank before incurring debt. Management believes that the Company has been in 
compliance with all the provisions of the resolution, which may not be 
amended or rescinded without the prior approval of the Reserve Bank.

NATIONAL BANKING ASSOCIATION RESTRICTIONS

     Uptown is a national banking association, and is limited with respect to 
the amount of dividends which they can pay to their shareholders under 
Sections 56 and 60 of the National Bank Act.

     Section 56 restricts a national bank from paying dividends if it would

losses and bad debts from "net profits then on hand". It also specifies that 
a portion of a bank's capital surplus account may be included as "net profits 
then on hand" to the extent that it represents earnings from prior periods.

     Section 60 requires the OCC's approval if the total of all dividends 
declared in any calendar year will exceed the institution's net profits of 
that year combined with its retained net profits of the preceding two years, 
less any required transfers to surplus. In calculating its net profits under 
Section 60 a national bank may not add back provisions made to its allowance 
for loan losses nor deduct net charge-offs.

ARIZONA STATE-CHARTERED BANK RESTRICTIONS

     Under the provisions of the Arizona Bank Code, dividends may not be 
declared by state-chartered banks unless they are made in compliance within 
the banking laws of Arizona. Additionally, the payment of dividends by a 
state-chartered bank whose deposits are insured by the Bank Insurance Fund, 
is affected by the requirement to maintain minimum capital pursuant to the 
capital adequacy guidelines issued by the FDIC.

           ITEM 7:  MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL
                      CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

                 (DOLLARS IN THOUSANDS, EXCEPT PER SHARE DATA)

     The following management's discussion and analysis of financial 
condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with the 
Company's Consolidated Financial Statements and Notes to Consolidated 
Financial Statements presented in Item 8 of this Form 10-K as well as the 
section headed Selected Financial Data presented in Item 6 of this Form 10-K.

     This discussion and analysis is intended to address significant factors 
affecting the Company's consolidated statements of condition and statements 
of income for the past three years. The discussion is designed to provide 
shareholders with a comprehensive review of the operating results and 
financial condition of the Company.

SUMMARY

     The Company's consolidated net income for 1995 totaled $1,018 or $4.59 
per share. This is compared to net income and earnings per share of $806 or 
$3.63 and $703 or $3.14 for 1994 and 1993, respectively. The results of 1995 
represent a 26% improvement in net income from 1994 and a 45% improvement 
over 1993. As we noted last year and, again, consistent in the current year, 
the earnings improvement is mostly attributable to increased net interest 
income.

     Return on average shareholders' equity for 1995 was 5.66% as compared to 
4.55% in 1994 and 3.90% in 1993. Return on average assets for 1995 was .49% 
as compared to .39% in 1994 and .35% in 1993.

     Non-performing loans decreased during the past three year period. 
Non-performing loans totaled $3,799 or 3.42% of net loans at December 31, 
1995 as compared to 4.01% in 1994 and 4.24% in 1993. Non-performing loans 
totaled $3,949 and $3,927 in 1994 and 1993, respectively.

     Upbancorp continues to maintain a strong capital structure at December 
31, 1995 as a result of the improving earnings level and the historical level 
of shareholders' investment. Combined capital levels, as well as individual 
Subsidiary Banks' capital ratios, are above regulator established minimums.

NET INTEREST INCOME

     The major source of income for the Company is net interest income. In 
1995, net interest income provided 83% of Upbancorp's net revenues (net 
interest income plus non-interest income), compared with 83% in 1994 and 81% 
in 1993.

     Net interest income represents the difference between interest income 
and fees earned on loans, securities and other earning assets and interest 
expense paid for the funding sources used to finance those assets. This is 
impacted by both the volume of earning assets and paying liabilities and the 
rates earned and paid, respectively, on those assets and liabilities. Net 
interest margin represents net interest income as a percentage of total 
interest earning assets.

     The following is a summary of net interest margin and net interest 
income. For purposes of this discussion, both have been adjusted to a fully 
tax equivalent basis for the various tax exempt loans and securities.

</TABLE>
 (1)     Interest income and yields on nontaxable securities and loans are 
         reflected on a tax equivalent basis based upon a statutory Federal 
         income tax rate of 34% for 1995, for 1994 and 1993.

     Net interest income, on a tax equivalent basis, increased by 9.74% or 
$885 in 1995 over 1994 after increasing by 8.53% or $714 in 1994 compared to 
1993. The tax equivalent net interest margin increased to 4.60% for 1995 as 
compared to 4.39% in 1994 and 4.21% in 1993.

     The 1995 increase in net interest income was positively affected by 
primarily both volume variance as well as variances directly attributable to 
rate fluctuations. A 55% or $483 positive variation is attributable to volume 
fluctuations and 49% or $432 to rate changes; the remaining small fluctuation 
is due to a combination of volume and rate.

     The net positive volume variance is primarily attributable to 
fluctuations within the loans and securities categories. The largest positive 
fluctuation of $1,043 between 1995 and 1994, was related to

14

<PAGE>

commercial and real estate loan growth. Partially offsetting this positive 
fluctuation is a negative volume impact of $666 due to the reduction in 
investment securities.

     Volume variances related to the placement of liabilities within the 
balance sheet positively affected net interest income by $28 as depositors 
transferred money from shorter-term transactional deposits into longer term 
fixed rate time deposits. As Table 1 depicts, this is due to the steady rate 
index of the former category as compared to the rate increases recognized in  
the latter.

     The net positive fluctuations attributable to rate are reflective of 
steady rate increases for both earning assets as well as paying liabilities. 
Rates paid on average earning assets increased by .61% as compared to rate 
increases of .40% attributable to interest bearing liabilities.

FUNDS MANAGEMENT ANALYSIS

     The earning asset portfolio of community banks is typically the leading 
determinate of performance for the institution. This is because the largest 
percentage of total income for the bank is attributable to net interest 
income. The policies and practices for managing liquidity risk and interest 
rate risk are set by the Subsidiary Banks' Funds Management Committees 
("FMCs") to ensure maximum returns within safe and sound risk parameters. The 
FMCs monitor exposures in view of market developments and the Banks' 
financial conditions, set guidance for interest rate risk management 
decisions, ensure consistency in the measurement of risk and monitors 
liquidity and capital adequacy. In this capacity, the FMCs place limits on 
the level of investments in various assets and off-balance sheet instruments, 
as well as on the funding levels for loans and deposits. In addition, the 
FMCs establish pricing policies for the Subsidiary Banks' products and 
services.

     We have recently increased the Subsidiary Banks' FMCs' role and related 
risk management processes. Special emphasis is warranted because of the 
importance of the asset and liability management process in determining the 
Subsidiary Banks' performance. Innovative new applications of funds 
management have been initialized by the Subsidiary Banks such as simulation 
modeling to measure the effects of varying interest rate scenarios and 
balance sheet strategies on net interest income.

INTEREST RATE SENSITIVITY MANAGEMENT

     Interest rate risk is the degree to which market interest rate 
fluctuations can effect net interest income. The Company not only responds to 
this interest rate risk, but also tries to anticipate and build strategies 
based on the current interest rate and maturity characteristics of the 
various balance sheet categories of assets and liabilities. This is done 
through a formalized funds management process and while there are several 
ways in which to analyze interest rate risk, the traditional method is called 
a "gap" analysis. A gap analysis is a static management tool used to identify 
mismatches or gaps in the repricing of assets and liabilities within 
specified periods of time.

     The Company's gap analysis as of December 31, 1995 is presented in Table 
3. Earning assets and interest bearing liabilities are presented within 
selected time intervals based upon their repricing and maturity 
characteristics. In a perfectly matched gap analysis, an equal amount of rate 
sensitive assets and liabilities would be reflected as repricing within each 
given time interval. A positive interest rate sensitivity gap indicates more 
assets than liabilities will reprice in that time period, while a negative 
gap indicates more liabilities will reprice.

                                                                             15

     Table 3 reflects a cumulative asset sensitive balance sheet within 
acceptable guidelines established by Company policy. This will more 
positively affect net interest income if interest rates rise then if they 
fall. Upbancorp and the Subsidiary Banks follow a policy of maintaining a 
relatively balanced mix of rate-sensitive assets and liabilities, making each 
side of the balance sheet equally flexible in reacting to changes in market 
interest rates so that net interest income will not be materially affected in 
periods of rising or falling interest rates.

     As previously discussed, Upbancorp is in the process of developing and 
utilizing a more dynamic approach to measuring interest rate risk by 
conducting simulations that demonstrate effects that would occur in net 
interest income under various interest rate scenarios and balance sheet 
structures.

LIQUIDITY MANAGEMENT

     A key element of the Company's FMC process is the management of 
liquidity. Liquid funds are needed by the Subsidiary Banks to meet the needs 
of their depositors, borrowers and for regulatory requirements. Liquid funds, 
however, generally have very low earnings potential and thus careful control 
of the Subsidiary Banks liquidity position is needed. Monitoring of this 
liquidity position is done daily to ensure constant adequacy and to maintain 
optimal levels of liquidity on the balance sheet. Another source of liquidity 
is off balance sheet, in the form of pre-approved loan commitments from the 
Federal Home Loan Bank and various correspondent banks.

     One component of analyzing the Company's liquidity position is through a 
careful review of available funding sources. The following tables provide 
information as it pertains to funding sources. Table 6 reflects a 
year-to-year comparison of the sources of the Company's liability funding 
based upon year-end balances.

</TABLE>

     Total funding sources has remained fairly steady from December 31, 1993 
through 1995; a small increased fluctuation of 3% was noted in 1994 as 
compared to 1995 and 1993. As noted in the table, an increase in other time 
deposits of $100 or more was noted over the past three year period. For a 
review of the maturities associated to this deposit category, please see the 
footnote entitled "Other Time Deposits" in the Notes to Consolidated 
Financial Statements found elsewhere in this Form 10-K.

     The increase of other  time deposits of $100 or more is a direct result 
of the slightly declining interest rates paid on money market accounts and 
the improving rates on time deposits. This has resulted in a transfer of 
funds between these two categories.

                                                                             17

    Borrowing facilities are availalbe to the Subsidiary Banks through 
various correspondent banks in the amount of $15,200. These lines are 
established for the purpose of borrowing on an overnight basis in the form of 
Federal Funds. Upon borrowing, all lines are to be secured by investment 
securities. In addition, Uptown has borrowing capacity with the Federal Home 
Loan Bank of Chicago in the amount of $15,840 for short and long term 
borrowings. The borrowings are to be secured by qualifying 1-4 first 
mortgages, private mortgage backed securities or U.S. Treasury and Agency 
Obligations.

CAPITAL RESOURCES

     A strong capital structure is vital for many reasons, one of which is to 
allow the Company the opportunity for future growth. Upbancorp has developed 
a policy to manage its capital structure and that of its Subsidiary Banks in 
accordance with regulatory guidelines and to ensure appropriate use of this 
resource. The Company's capital policy requires that the Company and its 
Subsidiary Banks maintain a capital ratio in excess of the minimum regulatory 
guidelines. At December 31, 1995, all entities exceeded regulatory 
established minimums as defined for "adequately capitalized" institutions.

     Table 7 analyzes the Company's and Subsidiary Banks' capital ratios for 
the prior three year period:

PROVISION AND ALLOWANCE FOR LOAN LOSSES

     The allowance for loans losses is established through a provision for 
loan losses charged to expense. Loans are charged against the allowance for 
loan losses when management believes that the collectibility of the loan 
principle is unlikely. The level of the provision for loan losses charged to 
operating expense as well as the balances maintained in the allowance for 
loan losses is dependent upon many factors, including loan growth, 
changes in the composition of the loan portfolio, net charge-off levels, 
delinquencies, collateral values and management's assessment of current and 
prospective economic conditions in the Company's primary market areas.

     The Subsidiary Banks measure the allowance for loan losses on a 
quarterly or more frequent basis using three measures of reserve adequacy. 
The first measurement compares the allowance to a percentage of the total 
loan portfolio. The second test measures the allowance against various loan 
pools, or types, using historical and peer group reserve percentages for 
expectations of possible loan losses on each category. The third is a 
detailed evaluation by all loan officers of classified or non-performing 
loans to ensure adequate allowance has been established for these individual 
assets.

     The allowance for loan losses is comprised of both allocated and 
unallocated allowances in order to quantify future loss potential. The 
allocated position represents management's assessment as to potential loss 
exposure based on both actual loan losses experienced historically and 
independent credit ratings on individual credits. The unallocated portion is 
that which is not specifically allocated to a particular loan or general loan 
category. At December 31, 1995, the allowance for loan losses was comprised 
of $1,222 and $180 of allocated and unallocated reserves, respectively.

</TABLE>

     As indicated by this table, the provision for loan losses amounted to 
$717 for 1995 compared to $291 in 1994 and $772 in 1993. This increase in the 
1995 provision is reflective of the 1995 charge-offs in addition to the 
Company's loan growth.

     The allowance for loan losses amounted to $1,402 for 1995 compared to 
$1,605 in 1994 and $1,421 in 1993. This overall reduction is the result of 
the Company's careful analysis of potential loan losses, the adequacy level 
as defined by management's internal analysis, the favorable trends in 
non-performing loans and the $948 in charge-offs absorbed during 1995.

NON-PERFORMING ASSETS

     Non-performing assets consist of both non-accrual loans, investments and 
other real estate owned. Non-accrual loans are those loans which have been 
determined to have reasonable doubt as to the timely collectibility of 
interest or principal. Other real estate owned ("OREO") represents real 
property which has been acquired through foreclosure or real estate which a 
Subsidiary Bank has obtained possession of in satisfaction of a debt. OREO is 
carried at the lower of the recorded investment value of the loan or the 
estimated fair market value, less estimated disposal costs of the related 
real estate. Past due loans are loans which are delinquent 30 days or more 
and are still accruing interest.

                                                                            19

</TABLE>

     Non-performing loans decreased to $3,799 at year-end 1995 from $3,949 at 
year-end 1994 while total non-performing assets increased to $5,276 from 
$4,284 in 1994. This increase is a direct result of OREO which increased 
$1,008 at year-end 1995 to $1,343 from $335 in 1994.

     A large percentage of the increase in 1995 is a result of the transfer 
into OREO of one property with a loan balance of $844 in December, 1995. This 
property is a 10 unit condominium complex; which subsequent to December 31, 
1995, four units had sold and contracts have been written on four of the 
remaining units. The balance has been reduced by $530 as of February 23, 
1996. All subsequent information, such as appraisals, contracts, etc., have 
indicated a complete recovery and reduction of this OREO balance within the 
next several months.

     Absent the property discussed above, the total non-performing asset 
balance experienced only a slight, $148, increase over year-end 1994. The 
majority of this was the classification of two securities to non-performing.

     As Table 9 indicates, in addition to the improving percentages in 
non-performing loans, past due loans have dramatically improved. A reduction 
of $3,341 was noted in this category, from $3,933 at December 31, 1994 to 
$592 at December 31, 1995. The December 31, 1995 numbers represents .53% of 
total net loans, an 87% improvement as a percentage of total net loans from 
the prior year-end.

NON-INTEREST INCOME

     Non-interest income increased 11% in 1995 compared to 1994. The 
continued improvement in non-interest income reflects the continued 
diversification of our sources of revenue. The following table analyzes the 
various sources of non-interest income for the years ended December 31, 1993 
through 1995.

</TABLE>

     Service charges on deposit accounts, the largest component of 
non-interest income, consists of fees on both interest bearing and 
non-interest bearing deposit accounts and charges for items such as 
insufficient funds, overdrafts and stop payment requests. Although deposit 
balances slightly decreased in 1995, revenue produced as a result of service 
charge income increased slightly. This is a result of careful monitoring and 
analysis of all depository accounts to ensure maximum recognition of all 
potential service charges.

     The addition of our mortgage banking activities at Heritage has produced 
revenues from the sale of mortgage loans into the secondary market. Income 
from mortgage loans sold in the secondary market was a significant 
contributor to the Bank's core earnings performance and does not affect the 
Bank's capital levels. It also does not create intangible assets on our 
balance sheet with respect to loans originated for sale as we do not 
participate in servicing or acquiring servicing rights. Mortgage banking fee 
income of $402 was recognized in 1995 along with interest income of $46.

     Net investment securities gains (losses) result from the sale of 
securities from the investment portfolio netted with valuation allowances 
established on securities which have experienced any type of market value 
deterioration. For a review of gains and losses related to the investment 
portfolio, please see the footnote entitled "Investment Securities" in the 
Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements found elsewhere in this Form 10-K.

NON-INTEREST EXPENSE

     Total non-interest expense increased 1.10% in 1995 compared to 1994, and 
increased 9.62% in 1994 over the level reported in 1993. This is reflective 
of the incremental increase in salaries and benefits which result from the 
necessary staffing enhancements due to the growth experienced both on and off 
the balance sheet. Off balance sheet increases are a result of the sale of 
mortgage loans as well as the participation of various commercial loans to 
other banking institutions, which is not carried within the balance sheet 
asset amounts. The Company's efficiency ratio continues to improve; for the 
year-ended December 31, 1995, the Company had an 80% efficiency ratio as 
compared to 88% for the prior year's period, a 9% improvement. The following 
table analyzes the various components of non-interest expense for the years 
ended December 31, 1993 through 1995.

     Salaries and benefits for the core employees have experienced relatively 
stable trends between 1994 and 1995. These core employees deliver all 
services except mortgage banking. Mortgage banking activities, where loans 
are sold into the secondary market, contributed to interest and fee income of 
the Subsidiary Banks of $448 in 1995; this is a result of closing on average 
$3 million per month in mortgage loans during 1995.

     A slight decline of $278 was recognized in non-interest expense not 
related to salaries and employee benefits from $4,931 at December 31, 1994 to 
$4,653 at December 31, 1995. Management continues to focus on cost 
containment and this control of expenses remains a priority as a part of our 
broader goal of maximizing long-term profitability.

</TABLE>

     The effective income tax rate for 1995 was 38% representing a 63% 
increase over 1994. The increase was due to an increase in state income 
taxes, the Company became a payor of Arizona income tax during 1995 as well 
as lower levels of income from Federal and state tax-exempt securities.

</TABLE>

     The Company's net income and per share net income for the third and fourth
quarters of 1995 totaled $310 or $1.40 and $334 or $1.51, respectively. This is
compared to net income and per share earnings for the first and second quarters
of $196 or $ .88 and $178 or $ .80, respectively. This increase is primarily the
result of a reduction in FDIC insurance premium assessments and a resulting
rebate for a four month period. Rebates of approximately $110 were received in
September by the Subsidiary Banks and a resulting reduction of approximately $27
per month was recognized during the remainder of 1995. 

     The Company became an Arizona income tax payor in the third quarter of 1995
thereby resulting in increased applicable income taxes during these two
quarters.

     The fourth quarter 1994 net income and per share net income totaled $96 or
$ .43, respectively. These lower operating results arose primarily from an
increase in other expense, which was attributable to several non-recurring
operational expenses.

UPBANCORP, INC.
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
FOR THE YEARS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 1995, 1994 AND 1993
(DOLLARS IN THOUSANDS, EXCEPT PER SHARE DATA)

1. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

     The accompanying financial statements have been prepared in conformity with
generally accepted accounting principles. The more significant accounting
policies, not described elsewhere in the notes to consolidated financial
statements, are as follows:

PRINCIPLES OF CONSOLIDATION

     Consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Upbancorp, Inc.
("Upbancorp" or the "Company"), and its subsidiaries, all of which are
wholly-owned. The subsidiaries include Uptown National Bank of Chicago
("Uptown") (including its wholly-owned subsidiaries, Uptown Safe Deposit Company
"SDC" and Broadway Clark Building Corporation "BCBC") and Heritage Bank
("Heritage"). Significant intercompany balances and transactions have been
eliminated in consolidation.

BASIS OF PRESENTATION

     Certain reclassifications have been made to the 1994 and 1993 consolidated
financial statements to conform to the 1995 presentation. Upbancorp uses the
accrual basis of accounting for financial reporting purposes, except for
immaterial sources of income and expense which are recorded when paid or
received.

NATURE OF BUSINESS

     The Company is a multi-bank holding company, organized in 1983 under the
laws of the State of Delaware. The Company owns all of the outstanding common
stock of Uptown, organized in 1929 and located in Chicago, Illinois and
Heritage, organized in 1977 and located in Phoenix, Arizona. Upbancorp does 


                                                                              27

not engage in any activities other than providing administrative services and
acting as a holding company for its subsidiary banks.

     The Company's affiliates consist of two full-service community banks, which
operate five banking offices in northern Chicago and metropolitan Phoenix. Both
Subsidiary Banks are engaged in the general commercial banking business in
addition to offering a complete range of retail banking services. The Subsidiary
Banks conduct a general banking business which embraces all of the usual
functions, both commercial and consumer, and which they may lawfully provide,
including, but not limited to:  the acceptance of deposits to demand, savings,
and time accounts and the servicing of such accounts; commercial, industrial,
consumer and real estate lending; collections; safe deposit box operations; and
other banking services tailored for both commercial and retail clients.

     Uptown's two wholly-owned subsidiaries, BCBC and SDC, are Illinois
corporations. SDC rents vault space and safe deposit boxes to Uptown and the
general public. BCBC owns all of the real estate that is used in connection with
the operation of Uptown's business with the exception of one facility.

USE OF ESTIMATES IN THE PREPARATION OF FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

    The preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally
accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and
assumptions. These estimates affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities
and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial
statements. In addition, they affect the reported amounts of revenues and
expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those
estimates.

CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS

    For purposes of reporting cash flows, cash and cash equivalents include
cash on hand and amounts due from banks.

INVESTMENT SECURITIES

    In May 1993, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ("FASB") issued
Statement of Financial Accounting Standards ("SFAS") No. 115, "Accounting for
Certain Investments in Debt and Equity Securities", which the Company adopted
effective January 1, 1994. SFAS No. 115 expands the use of fair value accounting
for certain investments, but retains the use of the amortized cost method for
investments the reporting enterprise has the intent and ability to hold to
maturity. Under SFAS No. 115, investment securities are classified as
held-to-maturity, available-for-sale or trading.

    In the fourth quarter of 1995, concurrent with the adoption of its
implementation guide on SFAS No. 115, FASB allowed a one-time reassessment of
the SFAS No. 115 classifications of all securities currently held. Any
reclassifications would be accounted for at fair value in accordance with SFAS
No. 115 and any reclassifications from the held-to-maturity portfolio that
resulted from this one-time reassessment would not call into question the
intent of the Company to hold other debt securities to maturity in the future.
The Company used the opportunity under this one- time reassessment to reclassify
$36,731 of investment securities from held-to-maturity to the available-for-sale
portfolio. In connection with this reclassification, gross unrealized gains of
$130 and gross unrealized losses of $558 were recorded in available-for-sale
securities and in shareholders' equity (on a net-of-tax basis). At December 28,
1995, the majority of the Company's investments were reclassified to the
available-for-sale portfolio.

    The available-for-sale portfolio is carried at fair market value with
unrealized gains and losses, net of tax, reported as a separate component of
shareholders' equity. Prior to the adoption of SAFS No. 115, securities
available-for-sale were carried at the lower of amortized cost or market value
on an aggregate basis. These available-for-sale securities are those which
management believes could be sold prior to maturity in order to manage interest
rate risk, prepayment or liquidity risk.

    The held-to-maturity portfolio is recorded at cost adjusted for
amortization of premium and accretion of discount in accordance with
management's positive intent and ability to hold these securities to final
maturity. Premium and discount on held-to-maturity securities are amortized
(deducted) and accreted (added), respectively, to interest income using the
level yield method over the period from acquisition to maturity, or earlier call
date, of the related securities.

<PAGE>

MORTGAGES HELD-FOR-SALE

    The Company routinely sells to investors its originated residential
mortgage loans and retains no servicing rights relating to these mortgages sold.
Mortgage activity includes both mortgages held-for-sale which are recorded on
the Company's books for a period of 5-10 days, all with pre-purchase
agreements, in addition to loans sold directly into the secondary market.
Mortgages held-for-sale are carried at cost for a period of up to ten days with
interest income recognized for that period. Mortgage banking fees are recorded
at the date of purchase. For purposes of this report, mortgages held-for-sale
and mortgage banking fees relate only to these two types of mortgage activities;
not to mortgages which are originated, booked and serviced by the Company.

LOANS AND ALLOWANCE FOR LOAN LOSSES

    Loans are carried at the principal amount outstanding, net of unearned
income, including certain deferred loan fees. Unearned discounts on certain
loans are credited to income over the term of the loan using the sum-of-month's
digits method which approximates the level yield method. Interest income on
loans is accrued based on principal amounts outstanding. Non-refundable loan
origination and commitment fees, and incremental direct costs, are deferred and
amortized to income on a straight-line basis over the contractual life of the
loan.

    It is the Company's policy to discontinue the accrual of interest income on
any loan when, in the opinion of management, there is reasonable doubt as to the
ultimate collection of interest or principal. Non-accrual loans are returned to
an accrual status when, in the opinion of management, the financial position of
the borrower and other relevant factors indicate there is no longer any
reasonable doubt as to the timely payment of principal or interest.


    The allowance for loan losses includes management's estimate of the amounts
expected to be lost on specific loans and for losses on other as of yet
unidentified loans included in loans receivable at December 31, 1995. In
estimating the potential losses on specific loans, management relies on a
combination of in-house prepared discounted cash flow analyses and valuations by
independent appraisers. In estimating the reserve component for unidentified
losses within the portfolio, management relies on historical experience by loan
type adjusted for any known trends in the portfolio. The amounts the Company
will ultimately realize could differ materially in the near term from the
amounts assumed in arriving at the allowance for possible loan losses reported
in the financial statements at December 31, 1995.

    In May 1993, FASB issued SFAS No. 114, "Accounting by Creditors for
Impairment of a Loan."  This new statement requires that a creditor measures
impairment of a loan based upon the present value of expected future cash flows,
or if the loan is collateral dependent, the fair value of the underlying
collateral. In October, 1994, SFAS No. 114 was amended by SFAS No. 118,
"Accounting by Creditors for Impairment of a Loan-Income Recognition and
Disclosures", to allow a creditor to use existing methods to recognize interest
income on impaired loans. Both statements are effective for fiscal years
beginning after December 15, 1994. As required, Upbancorp adopted these new
standards January 1, 1995. Management believes the adoption of these statements
did not have a material effect on the consolidated financial statements.

PREMISES AND EQUIPMENT

    Bank premises and equipment are stated at cost less accumulated
depreciation. Depreciation is computed principally on the straight-line method
over the estimated useful lives of the assets which range between three and
thirty years. Maintenance and repairs are charged to expense when incurred;
improvements are capitalized. Gains and losses on routine disposition, which are
not significant, are reflected in current operations.

OTHER REAL ESTATE OWNED

    Other real estate owned consists of properties acquired in partial or total
satisfaction of debt and is carried at the lower of the recorded investment
value of the loan or the estimated fair market value, less estimated disposal
costs of the related real estate. Losses arising at acquisition are charged
against the allowance for loan losses. Write-downs to reflect reductions in fair
value subsequent to acquisition are recorded in other expense in the
consolidated statements of income, while any gains which are realized on the
disposition of such properties are included in other income. Other real estate
owned included in other assets at December 31, 1995 and 1994 is approximately
$1,343 and $335, respectively.


                                                                              29

<PAGE>

GOODWILL

    Goodwill arising from the acquisition of Heritage Bank is being amortized
on a straight line basis through 2002, in addition to direct reductions allowed
through net operating loss credits utilization. As of December 31, 1995 and
1994, goodwill of $318 and $455, net of accumulated amortization, is included in
other assets in the consolidated statement of condition.

INCOME TAXES

    In February, 1992, FASB issued SFAS No. 109, "Accounting for Income Taxes".
Under the asset and liability method of SFAS No. 109, deferred tax assets and
liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to
differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets
and liabilities and their respective tax bases. To the extent that current
available evidence about the future raises doubt about the realization of a
deferred tax asset, a valuation allowance must be established. Deferred tax
assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to
taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to
be recovered or settled. Under SFAS No. 109, the effect on deferred tax assets
and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period
that includes the enactment date.

2. INVESTMENT SECURITIES

    The U. S. Treasury securities outstanding at December 31, 1995 are due on
or before December 31, 1996. The amortized cost and estimated market value of
HELD-TO-MATURITY securities are as follows at December 31:

</TABLE>

    Investment securities carried at approximately $11,061 and $12,015 at
December 31, 1995 and 1994, respectively, were pledged to secure public and
trust deposits and for other purposes as required or permitted by law.

    Market value of the held-to-maturity and available-for-sale portfolios is
determined by reference to quoted market prices, if available. If quoted market
prices are not available, market value is estimated using quoted market pries
for similar securities.

    Included in the "States and political subdivisions" total are approximately
$710 of securities that began to experience market value deterioration in the
beginning of 1994. An allowance has been established associated to this security
totaling $257 as of December, 1995. These investments are carried at estimated
market value as securities available-for-sale on the balance sheet. The
difference between the amortized cost and the estimated market value is carried
in the unrealized losses on securities available-for-sale, net of tax, within
the balance sheet.

Bank granted advances of $3,238 and received repayments of $3,610. All loans
were performing at December 31, 1995 in accordance with their stated terms.

$3,135 at December 31, 1995, 1994, and 1993, respectively. If interest on
non-accrual loans had been accrued, such income would have approximated $419,

     In prior years, the Company was subject to the Alternative Minimum Tax
(AMT). An AMT credit is created for the excess of AMT paid over the regular tax.
This credit, which does not expire, is available to reduce tax liabilities in
future years to the extent future years' regular tax exceeds the AMT. At
December 31, 1995, the Company had an AMT credit  carryforward of approximately
$418 for federal income tax purposes.

     The Company is a party to several routine legal proceedings encountered as
the result of normal business transactions. Management believes, after
consultation with counsel, that these proceedings will not have a material
impact on the Company's results of operations or financial position.


                                                                              35

10. STATUTORY/REGULATORY RESTRICTIONS

     The Company's Subsidiary Banks are required by the Federal Reserve Act to
maintain reserves against their deposits. Reserves are held either in the form
of vault cash or balances maintained directly with the Federal Reserve Bank.
Required reserves are a function of daily average deposit balances and statutory
reserve ratios prescribed by type of deposit. At December 31, 1995, a reserve
balance of approximately $1,892 was required of the Company's Subsidiary Banks.

     The approval of the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC) is
necessary before Uptown Bank's dividend during any year can exceed the total of
Uptown Bank's net profits (as defined) for the current year combined with
retained net profits of the preceding two years. As of December 31, 1995, Uptown
may distribute dividends of approximately $91 without prior approval from the
OCC.

     In June, 1992, at the request of the Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago 
("Reserve Bank"), the Company's Directors adopted a resolution that requires 
the Company to notify the Reserve Bank in writing 30 days prior to the 
declaration of dividends, and obtain prior written approval of the Reserve 
Bank before incurring debt. Management believes that the Company has been in 
compliance with all the provisions of the resolution, which may not be 
amended or rescinded without the prior approval of the Reserve Bank.

     The Company is not subject to any other specific regulations that restrict
dividend payments.

11. FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS WITH OFF-BALANCE SHEET RISK

     The Subsidiary Banks are parties to financial instruments with 
off-balance sheet risk in the normal course of business to meet the financing 
needs of its customers. These financial instruments include commitments to 
extend credit and standby letters of credit. These instruments involve, to 
varying degrees, elements of credit risk in excess of the amount recognized 
in the balance sheet. The contract amounts of these instruments reflect the 
extent of involvement a bank has in particular classes of financial 
instruments.

     The Banks' exposure to credit loss in the event of nonperformance by the 
other party for commitments to extend credit and standby and commercial 
letters of credit is presented by the contractual amount of those 
instruments. The Banks use the same credit policies in making commitments and 
conditional obligations as it does for on-balance sheet instruments.

<TABLE>
<CAPTION>
    Financial instruments whose contract
     amounts represent credit risk:
                                                       Contract Amount
                                                   -------------------------

      Commitments to extend credit                $  33,589      $  36,141
      Letters of credit:
       Standby                                          620              6
       Commercial                                       950          1,439

</TABLE>



     Commitments to extend credit are agreements to lend to a customer as long
as there is no violation of any condition established in the contract.
Commitments generally have fixed expiration dates or other termination clauses
and may require payment of a fee. Since many of the commitments are expected to
expire without being drawn upon, the total commitment amounts do not necessarily
represent future cash requirements. The Banks evaluate each customer's
creditworthiness on a case-by-case basis. The amount of collateral obtained if
deemed necessary by the Banks upon extension of credit is based on management's
credit evaluation of the customer. Collateral held varies but may include
accounts receivable, marketable securities, inventory, property, plant, and
equipment, and income-producing commercial properties and residential
properties.

     Standby letters of credit are conditional commitments issued by the Banks
to guarantee the performance of a customer to a third party. Those guarantees
are primarily issued to support public and private borrowing arrangements. The
credit risk involved in issuing letters of credit is essentially the same as
that involved in extending loan facilities to customers. The Banks hold various
types of collateral (primarily certificates of deposit) to support those
commitments for which collateral is deemed necessary. Most of the letters of
credit expire within twelve months.

     Where readily available, quoted market prices were utilized by the Company.
If quoted market prices were not available, fair values were based on estimates
using present value calculations. As this method is significantly affected by
assumptions used, such as the discount rate and estimates of future cash flows,
the estimates cannot be substantiated by comparison to independent markets and,
in many cases, could not be realized upon immediate settlement of the
instruments. Certain financial instruments and all non-financial assets and
liabilities have been omitted from this disclosure requirement; accordingly, the
aggregate fair value amounts presented do not represent the underlying value of
Upbancorp. The following methods and assumptions were used in estimating the
fair value for financial instruments.

CASH AND DUE FROM BANKS AND FEDERAL FUNDS SOLD

The fair values reported for cash and cash equivalents were estimated to be
their carrying value as they are highly liquid and short-term in nature.

INVESTMENT SECURITIES HELD-TO-MATURITY AND INVESTMENT
SECURITIES AVAILABLE-FOR-SALE

Fair values of securities held-to-maturity and available-for-sale are
determined by reference to quoted market prices, if available. If quoted market
prices are not available, fair value is estimated using quoted prices for
similar securities.

LOANS, NET OF UNEARNED DISCOUNT AND MORTGAGES HELD-FOR-SALE

Fair value of the loan portfolio was estimated by discounting anticipated future
cash flows using current rates at which similar loans would be made with the
same remaining maturity.

ACCRUED INTEREST RECEIVABLE

Due to its short-term nature, the fair value of accrued interest receivable 
was estimated at carrying value.



                                                                           37

<PAGE>


DEPOSITS

The fair value of deposits with no stated maturities is estimated to be the
carrying value. Fair value of fixed maturity certificates is estimated by
discounting future cash flows using rates currently offered for deposits of
similar remaining maturities.

OTHER BORROWED FUNDS

As these instruments are short-term in nature, their fair value is estimated to
be their carrying value.

ACCRUED INTEREST PAYABLE

Due to its short-term nature, the fair value of accrued interest payable was
estimated at carrying value.

REPORT OF MANAGEMENT ON RESPONSIBILITY FOR FINANCIAL REPORTING
UPBANCORP, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES

To the Shareholders of Upbancorp, Inc.:

         The accompanying consolidated financial statements were prepared by
Management, who is responsible for the integrity and objectivity of the data
presented. In the opinion of Management, the financial statements, which
necessarily include amounts based on Management's best estimates and judgments,
have been prepared in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles
appropriate to the circumstances and are free from material fraud and error.

         Management depends upon the Company's system of internal controls in
meeting its responsibilities for reliable financial statements. This system is
designed to provide reasonable assurance that assets are safeguarded and that
transactions are properly recorded and executed in accordance with management's
authorization. Judgments are required to assess and balance the relative cost
and the expected benefits of these controls. As an integral part of the system
of internal controls, the Bank Subsidiaries contract with a professional staff
of Independent Internal Auditors who conduct operational, financial, and special
audits, and coordinate audit coverage.

         The consolidated financial statements have been audited by our
Independent Public Accountants, Arthur Andersen LLP, who render an independent
professional opinion on Management's financial statements.

         The Audit Committee of Upbancorp, Inc.'s Board of Directors, which is
composed solely of outside directors, meets regularly with the Independent
Public Accountants, Independent Internal Auditors and Management to assess the
scope of the annual examination plan and to discuss audit, internal control and
financial reporting issues, including major changes in accounting policies and
reporting practices. The Independent Public Accountants and Independent Internal
Auditors have free access to the Audit Committee, without Management present, to
discuss the results of their audit work and their evaluations of the adequacy of
internal controls and the quality of financial reporting.

         Management also recognizes its responsibility for fostering a strong
ethical climate so that its affairs are conducted according to the highest
standards of personal and corporate conduct. This responsibility is
characterized and reflected in the Company's code of ethical business practices
policy, which is publicized throughout the Company. The policy addresses, among
other things, the necessity of ensuring open communication within the Company;
potential conflicts of interest; compliance with all domestic and foreign laws,
including those relating to financial disclosure; and the confidentiality of
proprietary information. The Company maintains a systematic program to assess
compliance with these policies.

Sincerely,

PUBLIC ACCOUNTANTS

of Upbancorp, Inc.:

changes in shareholders' equity for each of the three years in the period ended
December 31, 1995. These financial statements are the responsibility of the
Company's management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these
financial statements based on our audits.

           We conducted our audits in accordance with generally accepted
auditing standards. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit
to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free
of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence
supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. An audit
also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates
made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement
presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our
opinion.

           In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present
fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of Upbancorp, Inc. and
subsidiaries as of December 31, 1995 and 1994, and the results of their
operations and their cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended
