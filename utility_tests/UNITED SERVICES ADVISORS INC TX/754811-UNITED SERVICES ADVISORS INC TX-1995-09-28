ITEM 1. BUSINESS.

     United Services Advisors,  Inc., a Texas corporation organized in 1968 (the
"Company" or "Registrant"), and its wholly-owned subsidiaries provide five types
of  services:  (1)  investment  adviser  to  institutions  (namely,   investment
companies) and other persons;  (2) transfer agency and record keeping  services;
(3) mailing  services;  (4) custodial and  administrative  services for IRAs and
other  types  of  retirement   plans;  and  (5)   administrative   services  for
institutions (namely,  investment companies) and other persons. The provision of
investment advisory,  transfer agent,  administrative and custodial services are
the primary sources of the Company's  revenue.  (See Consolidated  Statements of
Operations in Item 8 of this Form 10-K.)

     The  Company  is a  registered  investment  adviser  under  the  Investment
Advisers  Act of 1940 and is  principally  engaged in the  business of rendering
investment advisory and other services to United Services Funds, a Massachusetts
business  trust  ("USF",  "Trust"  or  "Funds").  USF  is  a  no-load,  open-end
management  investment  company which offers  shares of  beneficial  interest in
thirteen  diversified  portfolios or sub-trusts  (commonly referred to as mutual
funds).

     The Company organized U.S. Advisers  (Guernsey) Ltd. on August 20, 1993 for
the purpose of acting as "Manager"  for  investment  companies  whose shares are
offered to non-U.S.  citizens.  U.S. Advisors  (Guernsey) Ltd. has delegated its
administrative  duties to Butterfield Fund Managers  (Guernsey)  Limited and its
investment   advisory  duties  to  Registrant.   The  off-shore  fund  commenced
operations during September 1993.

     The Company is the  administrator to  Pauze'/Swanson  United Services Funds
("PSUSF"),  a Massachusetts  business trust formed on November 1, 1993. PSUSF is
an open-end  management  investment  company.  The Pauze' U.S.  Government Total
Return Bond Fund,  a no-load  mutual fund,  is one series of PSUSF.  The Company
does not furnish investment advice to this Fund;  however,  it generally manages
the  affairs  of the  Fund  under an  Administrative  Services  Agreement  dated
November 1, 1993.

     The  Company  is also the  investment  advisor  to the  Accolade  Funds,  a
Massachusetts   business  trust.   Accolade  Funds  is  an  open-end  management
investment  company  which  offers  shares of the Bonnel  Growth Fund, a no-load
mutual fund. The Bonnel Growth Fund commenced operations in October 1994.

     The Company is the investment  advisor to United  Services  Insurance Funds
("USIF"), a Massachusetts  business trust formed for the purpose of providing an
investment  vehicle for variable annuity products.  USIF currently offers shares
of the Schabacker  Select Fund through variable annuity  contracts  purchased by
clients from Integrity Life Insurance Company. USIF commenced operations in June
1995.  Marleau,  Lemire (USA), Inc., which occupies office space supplied by the
Registrant, acts as broker for the variable annuity contracts.

     During July 1994, USAI agreed to form a joint venture with Marleau,  Lemire
Inc. of Montreal, Quebec, to offer mutual funds in Canada. In February 1995, the
joint venture,  United Services Advisors Wealth Management Inc. ("USAWMI"),  was
formed.  In July 1995, Guy Prescott was named Chief Executive Officer of USAWMI,
and he  commenced  efforts to qualify  USAWMI so that it may provide  investment
management services as well as offer shares of mutual funds in Canada.

     Registrant  trades securities for its own account.  Management  believes it
can more effectively  manage the Company's cash position by broadening the types
of investments utilized in cash management.

MUTUAL FUND MANAGEMENT

     For each of the funds it manages, the Company provides portfolio management
services,  subject to the overall  supervision and review of a Board of Trustees
of each trust.  Consistent  with the  investment  restrictions,  objectives  and
policies of the particular fund, the portfolio  manager for each fund determines
what  investments  should be purchased,  sold and held, and makes changes in the
portfolio  deemed to be  necessary  or  appropriate.  Though  subject to overall
supervision  and review by  management,  the  portfolio  managers of the various
funds  are  generally  given  reasonable  latitude  with  regard  to  investment
decisions  relating to the fund for which each is  responsible.  In the advisory
agreement  with the funds,  the Company is charged with seeking the best overall
terms in executing  portfolio  transactions  and  selecting  brokers or dealers.
Depending  upon the  particular  fund and the particular  security  involved,  a
variety of brokers and dealers are utilized by the Company.

     The tables on the  following  pages  reflect the net assets for each of the
funds  managed or  administered  by the Company as of the dates  indicated.  The
information  in parentheses  immediately  following each fund name in the tables
indicate  the  year  of a  fund's  establishment  and a  brief  summary  of  its
investment objectives.

THE ADVISORY AGREEMENTS

     The funds  comprising  USF,  Accolade  and USIF are  managed by the Company
pursuant to advisory agreements (the "Advisory Agreements").  Under the terms of
each Advisory Agreement, the Company provides management and investment advisory
services to each of the funds.  The Company  receives an advisory  fee from each
fund based on a  percentage  of each  fund's  average  net  assets.  The Company
furnishes  an  investment  program  for each of the mutual  funds it manages and
determines,  subject  to the  overall  supervision  and  review  of the Board of
Trustees  of the funds,  the  funds'  investments.  The  Company  also  manages,
supervises  and  conducts  certain  other  affairs of the funds,  subject to the
control of the Boards of Trustees.

     In addition,  the Company  provides  office space,  facilities  and certain
business  equipment and also  provides the services of  executive,  clerical and
accounting  personnel for  administering  the affairs of the mutual  funds.  The
Company and its affiliates  compensate all  personnel,  officers,  directors and
interested  Trustees  if  such  persons  are  employees  of the  Company  or its
affiliates.  However,  the funds are  required  to  reimburse  the Company for a
portion of the compensation of the Company's employees who perform certain state
and federal  securities  law regulatory  compliance  work on behalf of the funds
based  upon the time  spent on such  matters.  Under the  terms of the  Advisory
Agreements,  the Company pays the expense of printing  and mailing  prospectuses
and sales  materials used for  promotional  purposes.  Other than the foregoing,
each fund pays its allocable  portion of all other  expenses for the  operations
and activities of the funds which the Company manages and administers.

     On October 14,  1994,  the Board of Trustees of USF  approved  the Advisory
Agreement with the Company through  October 30, 1995. The Advisory  Agreement is
subject to annual renewal by a majority vote of the shareholders of each fund or
the Trustees of USF and by the vote of a majority of the disinterested  Trustees
cast in person at a meeting  called for the purpose of voting on such  approval.
As required by the  Investment  Company Act of 1940,  the Advisory  Agreement is
terminable upon 60 days notice.  The Board of Trustees will consider  renewal of
the Agreement on October 25, 1995 and it is expected that it will be renewed.

     On September 14, 1995 the Board of Trustees of Accolade  Funds approved the
Advisory  Agreement  with the Company  through  September 21, 1996. The Advisory
Agreement is subject to annual renewal by a majority vote of the shareholders of
each fund or the Trustees of Accolade Funds and by the vote of a majority of the
disinterested  Trustees  cast in person at a meeting  called for the  purpose of
voting on such approval.  As required by the Investment Company Act of 1940, the
Advisory Agreement is terminable upon 60 days notice.

     The Board of Trustees of USIF  approved  the  Advisory  Agreement  with the
Registrant  in July 1995.  The terms of the Advisory  Agreement  provide that it
will continue  initially for two years, and from year to year thereafter as long
as it is  approved  at least  annually  both (i) by a vote of a majority  of the
outstanding voting securities of each Fund (as defined in the Investment Company
Act of 1940) or by the Board of Trustees  of the Trust,  and (ii) by a vote of a
majority  of the  Trustees  who are not  parties to the  Advisory  Agreement  or
"interested  persons" of any party  thereto,  cast in person at a meeting called
for the  purpose  of voting on such  approval.  As  required  by the  Investment
Company Act of 1940, the Advisory Agreement is terminable upon 60 days notice.

ADMINISTRATIVE AGREEMENT

PAUZE'/SWANSON UNITED SERVICES FUNDS

     The Administrative  Agreement between the Company and Pauze'/Swanson United
Services Funds was renewed in April 1995. The fees for providing  administrative
services  to the  Pauze'  U.S.  Government  Total  Return  Bond Fund are a fixed
monthly  fee,  with   compensation  for   coordinating   with  state  regulatory
authorities  based  on a  monthly  fee for  each  state  in  which  the  fund is
registered, and a percentage of average net assets in excess of $50 million.

MARKETING

     Since  taking  control of the  Company in October of 1989,  Management  has
endeavored to enhance its  reputation by shifting the Company's  focus away from
its  historical  gold  identity  to that of a  provider  of  balanced  financial
products and services and to build the  Company's  reputation  and establish its
credibility  as a  provider  of the  basic  building  blocks of  investing.  For
example,  the Company has been able to position its U.S.  Government  Securities
Savings Fund as the number one performing  government only money market fund for
more than 40 months  through early 1994 and the Fund  continues to be in or near
the  top  ten  of  such  funds  according  to  IBC/Donoghue.  IBC/Donoghue  is a
nationally  recognized  service which  establishes  its own categories for money
market  funds and which  publishes  said funds'  effective  yield  and/or  total
return, ranked in order of the yield.

     The Company markets the funds' shares  utilizing  various  techniques:  (1)
public  relations;  (2) direct  response  marketing;  (3)  attendance at various
investment conferences; (4) voluntarily waiving or reducing fees and agreeing to
bear  fund  expenses  beyond  a  stated  threshold  so that  the  fund  offers a
competitive  return;  and (5)  third-party  service  providers  such as  Schwab,
Fidelity and Jack White.

TRANSFER AGENT AND OTHER SERVICES

     The Registrant's wholly-owned subsidiary, United Shareholder Services, Inc.
("USSI"),  is a transfer agent registered  under the Securities  Exchange Act of
1934,  and  provides  transfer  agency,  bookkeeping,  accounting,  lockbox  and
printing  services  for USF,  PSUSF,  Accolade  and USIF.  The  transfer  agency
utilizes a coordinated internal system connecting the Company's fund shareholder
communication  network with computer equipment and software designed to meet the
operating requirements of a mutual fund transfer agency.

     The  transfer  agency's  duties  to the  funds  encompass:  (1)  acting  as
servicing  agent in connection  with dividend and  distribution  functions;  (2)
performing  shareholder account and administrative agent functions in connection
with issuance,  transfer and redemption or repurchase of shares; (3) maintaining
such records as are necessary to document transactions in the funds' shares; (4)
acting  as  servicing   agent  in   connection   with  mailing  of   shareholder
communications,  including  reports to  shareholders,  dividend and distribution
notices, and proxy materials for shareholder meetings; and (5) investigating and
answering all shareholder account inquiries.

     On October  14, 1994 the Board of Trustees  of USF  approved  the  transfer
agency  agreement  with USSI  through  October 31,  1995.  The  transfer  agency
agreement with USF provides that USSI will receive, as compensation for services
rendered  as transfer  agent,  an annual fee of $20.00 per  account,  except for
money  market   accounts  with  monthly  zero  balances.   In  connection   with
obtaining/providing  administrative  services to the beneficial  owners of Trust
shares  through  broker-dealers  which  provide  such  services  and maintain an
omnibus  account  with USSI,  each fund pays a monthly fee equal to  one-twelfth
(1/12) of 12.5 basis points (.00125) of the value of the shares of the fund held
in accounts at the broker-dealer, which payment shall not exceed $1.67 times the
average daily number of accounts holding USF shares at the broker-dealers.  USSI
bills  USF  separately  for  all  out-of-pocket  disbursements  incurred  at the
direction of USF.  Further,  the Trust assesses  account and transaction fees to
shareholders of certain  sub-trusts in accordance with the Funds'  prospectuses.
Said fees are paid directly to USSI which,  in turn,  applies such amounts first
to its annual fee and then, in the event  aggregate  fees and charges exceed its
annual fee, to out-of-pocket disbursements incurred at the direction of USF. The
remainder, if any, is retained by USSI.

     The transfer agency agreement with PSUSF provides for each Fund to pay USSI
an annual fee of $25.00 per account (1/12 of $25 monthly) with a minimum monthly
fee of $2,500.00. In connection with obtaining/providing administrative services
to the beneficial  owners of PSUSF shares through  broker-dealers  which provide
such  services  and  maintain  an omnibus  account  with USSI,  each fund pays a
monthly fee equal to  one-twelfth  (1/12) of 12.5 basis  points  (.00125) of the
value of the shares of the fund held in  accounts  at the  broker-dealer,  which
payment  shall not  exceed  $2.08  multiplied  by the  average  daily  number of
accounts holding PSUSF shares at the broker-dealers.

     In  September  1995 the Board of Trustees of Accolade  Funds  approved  the
transfer  agency  agreement  with USSI through  September 21 1996.  The transfer
agency  agreement  with  Accolade  Funds  provides  that USSI will  receive,  as
compensation  for services  rendered as transfer  agent, an annual fee of $20.00
per account. In connection with  obtaining/providing  administrative services to
the beneficial owners of Trust shares through  broker-dealers which provide such
services and maintain an omnibus account with USSI, each fund pays a monthly fee
equal to  one-twelfth  (1/12) of 12.5 basis points  (.00125) of the value of the
shares of the fund held in accounts at the  broker-dealer,  which  payment shall
not exceed $1.67 times the average daily number of accounts holding Trust shares
at the  broker-dealers.  USSI bills the Trust  separately for all  out-of-pocket
disbursements  incurred  at the  direction  of the  Trust.  Further,  the  Trust
assesses account and transaction  fees to shareholders of certain  sub-trusts in
accordance  with the Funds'  prospectuses.  Said fees are paid  directly to USSI
which,  in turn,  applies such amounts  first to its annual fee and then, in the
event  aggregate  fees and  charges  exceed its  annual  fee,  to  out-of-pocket
disbursements incurred at the direction of the Trust. The remainder,  if any, is
retained by USSI.

     As of August 31, 1995 total  accounts for  Pauze'/Swanson  United  Services
Funds was 34.

     As of August 31, 1995 total accounts for Accolade Funds was 1,734.

     For the three  fiscal years ended June 30,  1993,  1994 and 1995,  USF paid
USSI total transfer agency (including  lockbox and printing) fees of $2,343,018,
$2,681,398  and  $2,770,094,  respectively.  For the period ended June 30, 1994,
USSI  waived such fees for PSUSF,  and for the fiscal year ended June 30,  1995,
PSUSF paid USSI total of $31,711.  For the period ended June 30, 1995,  Accolade
paid USSI total fees of $10,671.

BOOKKEEPING AND ACCOUNTING

     USSI also maintains the books and records of each Trust and of each fund of
each Trust,  including  calculations of the daily net asset value per share. The
services are currently  provided to USF for an asset based fee on a tiered level
of average net assets -- subject to an annual  minimum fee of at least  $24,000.
The  services  are  currently  provided to Accolade  Funds and USIF for an asset
based  fee on a tiered  level of  average  net  assets --  subject  to an annual
minimum fee of $24,000. The agreements may be terminated by either party without
penalty by giving 60 days written notice.

     USSI performs bookkeeping and accounting services, and determines the daily
net asset value for each fund in PSUSF.  Those  services are provided at a fixed
annual fee of $37,500, payable in 12 monthly installments.  The agreement may be
terminated by either party without penalty by giving 60 days written notice.

MAILING SERVICES

     A&B Mailers, Inc., a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company,  provides mail
handling services to various persons. A&B Mailers' primary customers include the
Company  in  connection  with  its  efforts  to  promote  the  funds  and USF in
connection with required mailings.  Each service is priced  separately.  For the
three years ended June 30, 1993,  1994 and 1995,  USF paid A&B Mailers  $65,403,
$73,583 and $77,773,  respectively.  A&B Mailers'  total  revenue was  $333,922,
$402,077 and  $330,982,  respectively,  for the three years ended June 30, 1993,
1994 and 1995.

TRUST COMPANY SERVICES

     SECURITY  TRUST AND  FINANCIAL  COMPANY  ("ST&FC"),  a  wholly-owned  state
chartered trust company  provides  custodial and tax reporting  services for IRA
and other  retirement  plans funded with shares  issued by the funds advised and
administered  by the  Company.  ST&FC  also  actively  markets  401(k) and other
retirement  plans.  The custodial  fees are generally  paid to ST&FC at year-end
upon separate invoice to the customer,  not the fund. At June 30, 1995 ST&FC was
providing custodial services to 27,102 IRAs and other retirement  accounts.  Fee
revenue  attributable  to such  accounts for the fiscal year ended June 30, 1995
was $352,195.

     During  the  fiscal   year  ST&FC   commenced   providing   custodial   and
administrative  services to investor accounts managed by investment advisers not
associated  with  the  Registrant.   These  services  are  negotiated  with  the
client-adviser  and may be terminated upon notice.  Fee revenue  attributable to
such accounts for the fiscal year ended June 30, 1995 was $122,296.

EMPLOYEES

     As of June  30,  1994,  the  Company  and  its  subsidiaries  employed  111
full-time  employees  and 11 part-time  employees;  and, as of June 30, 1995, it
employed  100  full-time  employees  and  8  part-time  employees.  The  Company
considers its relationship with its employees to be excellent.

COMPETITION

     The mutual fund industry is highly  competitive.  As of June 30, 1995 there
were over 6,000 registered open-end management  investment  companies of varying
sizes and  investment  policies  whose shares were being  offered to the public.
Generally,  there  are two types of  mutual  funds:  "load"  and  "no-load."  In
addition  there  are both  no-load  and load  funds  which  have  "12b-1"  plans
authorizing the payment of  distribution  costs of the funds out of fund assets,
such as PSUSF and  Accolade  Funds.  Load funds are  typically  sold  through or
sponsored by brokerage firms, and a sales commission is charged on the amount of
the investment. No-load funds, such as USF's, however, may be purchased directly
from the particular  mutual fund  organization  and thus no sales  commission is
charged.

     In addition to  competition  from other mutual fund managers and investment
advisers,  the Company  and the mutual fund  industry  are in  competition  with
various  investment   alternatives  offered  by  insurance   companies,   banks,
securities dealers and other financial institutions.  Many of these institutions
are able to engage in more liberal  advertising  than mutual funds and may offer
accounts at competitive interest rates, which are insured by federally chartered
corporations  such  as  the  Federal  Deposit  Insurance   Corporation.   Recent
regulatory  pronouncements  related to the Glass-Steagall  Act, the statute that
has  prohibited  banks from  engaging  in  various  securities  activities,  are
enabling banks to compete with the Company in a variety of areas.

     A number of mutual  fund  groups are  significantly  larger  than the funds
managed by the Company,  offer a greater  variety of investment  objectives  and
have more  experience  and greater  resources to promote the sale of investments
therein.  However,  the Company  believes  it has the  resources,  products  and
personnel  to compete with these other mutual  funds.  Competition  for sales of
fund shares is influenced by various factors,  including  investment  objectives
and  performance,   advertising  and  sales  promotional  efforts,  distribution
channels and the types and quality of services offered to fund shareholders.

     Success  in the  investment  advisory  and mutual  fund share  distribution
businesses is substantially dependent on the Funds' investment performance,  the
quality of  services  provided  to  shareholders  and the  Company's  efforts to
effectively  market the performance.  In other words, good performance  combined
with a strong public relations program heightens investor awareness,  stimulates
sales of the Funds' shares and tends to keep  redemptions  low.  Sales of Funds'
shares  generate  management  fees  (which are based on assets of the Funds) and
transfer  agent  fees  (which are based on the  number of Fund  accounts).  Good
performance  also  attracts  private  institutional  accounts  to  the  Company.
Conversely, relatively poor performance results in decreased sales and increased
redemptions  of the  Funds'  shares  and the  loss  of  private  accounts,  with
corresponding decreases in revenues to the Company.

SUPERVISION AND REGULATION

     The Company,  USSI, and the investment companies it manages and administers
operate  under  certain  laws,  including  federal  and state  securities  laws,
governing their organization,  registration, operation, legal, financial and tax
status.  ST&FC  operates  under  certain  laws,  including  Texas  banking laws,
governing its organization,  registration,  operation,  legal, financial and tax
status. Among the penalties for violation of the laws and regulations applicable
to the  Company  and its  subsidiaries  are  fines,  imprisonment,  injunctions,
revocation of registration and certain additional  administrative  sanctions.  A
determination  that the Company or its management had violated  applicable  laws
and  regulations  could have a material  adverse  effect on the  business of the
Company.  Moreover,  there  is no  assurance  that  changes  to  existing  laws,
regulations or rulings promulgated by governmental  entities having jurisdiction
over the  Company and the funds will not have a material  adverse  effect on the
business of the Company.

     The Company is a registered investment adviser and is subject to regulation
by  the  U.S.  Securities  and  Exchange  Commission  ("SEC")  pursuant  to  the
Investment  Advisers  Act of 1940,  the  Investment  Company Act of 1940 and the
Securities  Exchange  Act of 1934 (the "1934  Act").  The Company is required to
keep and maintain  certain  reports and records which must be made  available to
the SEC upon request.  Moreover, the funds managed by the Company are subject to
regulation and periodic  reporting under the Investment Company Act of 1940 and,
with respect to their  continuous  public offering of shares,  the  registration
provisions of the Securities Act of 1933. The Company's affiliate transfer agent
operations  are  also  subject  to  the  provisions  of the  1934  Act  and  the
regulations promulgated thereunder.

     The  Investment  Company Act of 1940,  which governs the  activities of the
Company and the funds managed by it, requires any investment  advisory agreement
to be approved by the vote of a majority of the voting shares of the  applicable
mutual fund and provides that it will continue thereafter from year to year with
respect to each fund as long as it is approved at least  annually  both (i) by a
vote of a majority of the outstanding  voting  securities of each fund or by the
Board  of  Trustees  of the  Trust,  and  (ii)  by a vote of a  majority  of the
Independent  Trustees  cast in person at a meeting  called  for the  purpose  of
voting on such  approvals.  The  statute  further  provides  that an  investment
advisory agreement may be terminated at any time,  without penalty,  by a fund's
board of directors or a majority of its  outstanding  voting  shares on not more
than 60 days written notice to the investment adviser managing the fund and that
the  advisory  agreement  will  automatically  terminate  in  the  event  of its
assignment.

RELATIONSHIPS WITH THE FUNDS

     The businesses of the Company are to a very  significant  degree  dependent
upon their  associations and contractual  relationships  with the Trusts. In the
event any of the management or investment  company services  agreements with USF
were canceled or not renewed pursuant to the terms thereof, the Company would be
substantially  adversely  affected.  The Company,  USSI and ST&FC consider their
relationships with the Trusts to be good and they have no reason to believe that
their  management  and  service  contracts  will not be renewed  in the  future;
however,  there is no  assurance  that the Trusts will  choose to  continue  its
relationships with the Company, USSI, and ST&FC.

ITEM 2. PROPERTIES.

     The Company  presently  occupies  approximately a 46,000 square foot office
building  with  approximately  2.5 acres of land.  The  Company  purchased  this
building  from the  Resolution  Trust  Corporation  on February  28,  1992,  for
$1,018,165   (which  included  closing  costs).   To  finance   acquisition  and
improvements,  the Company  obtained a bank loan in the amount of $1,425,000 and
refinanced  the note during  fiscal year 1994.  (See Note E to the  Consolidated
Financial  Statements in Item 8 of this Form 10-K.) The Company moved to its new
headquarters  during August 1992. The Company has made substantial  improvements
to the building.  USAI, USSI, A&B Mailers, Inc., Marleau, Lemire (USA), Inc. and
ST&FC occupy sections in the building.

ITEM 3. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS.

     There is no material  legal  proceeding  to which the Company is  involved.
There are no  material  legal  proceedings  to which any  director,  officer  or
affiliate of the Company or any  associate of any such  director or officer is a
party  or  has a  material  interest,  adverse  to  the  Company  or  any of its
subsidiaries.

     In June 1994 Gerald Letch sued the Company in state  district court located
in San Antonio, Texas for breach of contract. Mr. Letch asked for an unspecified
amount of  damages  based  upon an alleged  oral  promise by a deceased  Company
officer to pay a finder's  fee for  introducing  certain  parties to the Company
leading to the  organization of PSUSF.  During August 1994 Mr. Letch amended his
complaint to include PSUSF and allegations of fraud and conspiracy  between USAI
and PSUSF.  During June 1995  summary  judgment  was  rendered in favor of PSUSF
which did not exist at the time the alleged cause of action arose. To date legal
fees and  expenses  to defend  this  action  exceed in  excess  of  $143,000,  a
significant portion of which was incurred during fiscal year 1995. The matter is
currently docketed for hearing in October 1995.

ITEM 4. SUBMISSION OF MATTERS TO A VOTE OF SECURITY HOLDERS.

     No  matters  were  submitted  to a vote of  Registrant's  security  holders
through the  solicitation  of proxies or otherwise  during the fourth quarter of
the fiscal year  covered by this report.  After the fiscal year end,  Registrant
solicited   proxies  for  a  proposal  to  increase  the  number  of  shares  of
Registrant's  preferred  stock.  Shareholders  voted to  increase  the shares of
Preferred  Stock  authorized  from  6,000,000  shares to  7,000,000  shares at a
shareholder meeting held August 3, 1995.

ITEM 5. MARKET FOR REGISTRANT'S COMMON EQUITY AND RELATED SHAREHOLDER MATTERS.

MARKET INFORMATION

     The Company may be considered to have two classes of common  equity--Common
Stock,  par value  $0.05 per share,  and  Preferred  Stock,  par value $0.05 per
share. The Company's Common Stock is divided into two sub-classes -- Class A and

     There is no  established  public  trading  market for the Company's  Common
Stock.

     The holders of the  Company's  Class A Common  Stock of record on March 12,
1985  (and  their  transferees  by gift,  devise or  descent)  have the right to

basis until April 30, 2000.  At August 31, 1995 the holders of 99,003  shares of
Class A Common Stock have the right to exchange.

     The Company's Preferred Stock is traded  over-the-counter;  is quoted daily
under the NASDAQ Small-Cap Issues and is listed as "USvAd pf" in the Wall Street
Journal. Trades are reported by NASDAQ under the symbol "USVSP."

     The  following  table  sets  forth  the range of high and low  closing  bid
quotations  from the NASDAQ  System for the fiscal years ended June 30, 1994 and
1995, as reported by the National  Quotation  Bureau,  Inc.,  NASDAQ reports and
financial  publications.  The quotations represent prices between dealers and do

HOLDERS

     On August 31, 1995 there were 79 holders of record of Class A Common Stock,
1 holder  of record of Class B Common  Stock  and 278  holders  of record of the
Preferred Stock.

     A substantial number of the Preferred shares are held of record by nominees
and  Management  believes  that as of August 31, 1995 there were more than 1,000
beneficial owners of the Company's Preferred Stock.

DIVIDENDS

     The Company has not paid cash dividends on its Common Stock during the last
eleven fiscal years,  and has never paid cash dividends on its Preferred  Stock.
Payment of cash  dividends is within the  discretion of the  Company's  Board of
Directors and is dependent  upon  earnings,  operations,  capital  requirements,
general financial condition of the Company and general business conditions.

     Holders of the  outstanding  shares of the  Company's  Preferred  Stock are
entitled to receive, when and as declared by the Company's Board of Directors, a
non-cumulative  cash  dividend  equal in the  aggregate  to 5% of the  Company's
after-tax  net earnings for its prior fiscal year.  After such dividend has been
paid,  the holders of the  outstanding  shares of Common  Stock are  entitled to
receive,  when  and as  declared  by the  Company's  Board  of  Directors,  cash
dividends per share equal to the cash dividends per share paid to the holders of
the Preferred  Stock.  Thereafter,  if the Board of Directors  determines to pay
additional  cash  dividends,  such  dividends will be paid  simultaneously  on a
prorata basis to holders of both the Preferred  Stock and the Common Stock.  The
holders  of the  Preferred  Stock are  protected  in certain  instances  against
dilution of the dividend amount payable to such holders.

ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S  DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS
     OF OPERATIONS.

INTRODUCTION

     Fiscal  1995  was  a  year  of  tremendous   challenges  which  required  a
significant  commitment of Management's  time and Company  resources in order to
overcome the effects of rising interest rates and regulatory pronouncements, the
consequences  of which  had a  direct  bearing  on our  largest  fund,  the U.S.
Government  Securities  Savings  Funds  ("USG").  As part of USAI's  response to
rising  interest  rates,  and regulatory  pronouncements  issued to money market
funds in general,  during  fiscal 1995 USAI  arranged  for the  purchase  and/or
purchased directly  approximately  $130.5 million par value adjustable rate U.S.
Government  agency notes  ("Notes")  from USG.  The Notes  acquired by USAI were
issued by the Federal  Home Loan Bank,  Federal Farm Credit Bank and the Student
Loan Marketing  Association and have the highest credit rating,  Aaa by Moody's,
will mature at their par value, and have a remaining  average weighted  maturity
of less than two years. These Notes were confused with high risk securities like
options,  futures,  structured notes, exotic floaters, or CMO's, which contain a
multiplicity  of  complex  and  undeterminable   risks,   including   extension,
prepayment,  and  coupon  cap  risks.  USAI  acquired  the  Notes  from  its top
performing money market fund in order to calm any  derivative-induced  fears and
to maintain the confidence of our  shareholders  by assuring a stable one dollar
per share net asset value.

     As a result of intense effort,  the Company was able to meet the challenges
presented  during fiscal 1995 while  continueing to expand products and services
by offering the Bonnel Growth Fund and by providing  additional services through
its trust company subsidiary.  During the year shareholders'  equity,  including
book value per share,  increased  due to the sale of Company  shares;  and,  the
Company's core business has continued to generate the revenue  necessary to meet
ongoing  expenses and the obligations  associated with the challenges  presented
during the year. Management believes the Company's financial condition is stable
and the Company is in a position to take advantage of  opportunities  presenting
themselves for future growth.  The discussion  below provides detail  concerning
the results of  operations  for recent  years and the  Company's  liquidity  and
capital resources.

RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

FISCAL YEAR 1994 VS. FISCAL YEAR 1993

     The Company  posted net  earnings of  $1,150,060  ($0.19 per share) for the
fiscal year ended June 30,  1994,  as compared to $91,466  ($0.02 per share) for
the fiscal year ended June 30, 1993.

ASSETS UNDER MANAGEMENT

     The Company's investment advisory fee revenue is based upon a percentage of
average  net assets  under  management.  Therefore,  fluctuations  in  financial
markets impact revenues and results of operations.

     Assets  under  management  for USF for the fiscal  year ended June 30, 1994
averaged $1.28 billion versus $782.4 million for the previous  fiscal year. This
64%  increase in average net assets was  primarily  the result of a $216 million
growth in gold related  average net assets under  management  and a $224 million
increase in average net assets in the U.S. Government Securities Savings Fund.

     As of September 20, 1994, total assets under management were  approximately
$1.46 billion with non-gold  assets  comprising  nearly 60% of this total versus
65% at June 30, 1993.

FUND SHAREHOLDER ACCOUNTS

     Corresponding  to the  increase in total  assets  under  management  during
fiscal 1994, investors opened in excess of 23,000 new accounts. This compares to
approximately 18,000 new accounts opened during fiscal 1993. Further, the number
of account closures decreased by 9% comparing fiscal 1994 to fiscal 1993.

REVENUES

     Total  consolidated  revenues  for the  fiscal  year  ended  June 30,  1994
increased  approximately  47% over  the  previous  fiscal  year.  This  resulted
primarily  from a 64% increase in investment  advisory fee revenue.  The Company
also recorded an increase in investment income primarily from gains on the sales
of  investments.  Additionally,  exchange  fee  revenue  increased  70%  due  to
increased  shareholder  exchange  activity  between mutual fund  accounts.  Fees
associated with operation of the Transfer Agent increased approximately $266,000
due to an  increase  in the  average  number of fee based  accounts  outstanding
during the 1994 fiscal year. Miscellaneous transfer agency fees increased due to
performing lock-box and printing functions for United Services Funds.

EXPENSES

     General and  administrative  expenses  increased  approximately  42% during
fiscal 1994.  This increase  resulted  principally  from  increases in aggregate
compensation, marketing, distribution, and fund expenses borne.

     Greater  compensation  and related costs are attributable to a 15% increase
in the number of full time equivalent employees.  Rather than provide for annual
cost of living  increases,  the Company has tied  increases in  remuneration  to
employee performance (bonus plans) for purposes of further enhancing quality and
productivity.  The overall  performance  of certain  mutual funds managed by the
Company has provided the Company with the  opportunity  to expose these funds to
more investors. Increased marketing efforts coupled with mutual fund performance
is  contributing  to the growth in assets  under  management  (see Assets  Under
Management above).

FISCAL YEAR 1995 VS. FISCAL YEAR 1994

     The  Company  posted a net loss of  $3,847,434  ($0.64  per  share) for the
fiscal  year ended June 30,  1995,  as compared  to net  earnings of  $1,150,060
($0.19 per share) for the fiscal year ended June 30, 1994.

ASSETS UNDER MANAGEMENT

     The Company's investment advisory fee revenue is based upon a percentage of
average  net assets  under  management.  Therefore,  fluctuations  in  financial
markets impact revenues and results of operations.

     Assets  under  management  for USF for the fiscal  year ended June 30, 1995
averaged  $1.32  billion  versus  $1.28  billion for the  previous  fiscal year.
Additionally, assets under management for the Accolade Funds ("Accolade"), which
commenced  operations in October 1994, averaged $5.6 million for the fiscal year
ended June 30, 1995.

     As of September 22, 1995,  total assets under  management for USF were over
$1.30 billion with non-gold assets  comprising 65% of this total,  which was the
same percentage at June 30, 1994.

REVENUES

     Total  consolidated  revenues  for the  fiscal  year  ended  June 30,  1995
increased  approximately  45% over  the  previous  fiscal  year.  This  resulted
primarily from interest income and accretion on the U.S. Government Agency Notes
("Notes")  which were purchased  during the fiscal year. See further  discussion
regarding  the  purchase of the Notes  following in the  "Liquidity  and Capital
Resources" section of Item 7 "Management's  Discussion and Analysis of Financial
Condition and Results of Operations" in this Form 10K.

     Excluding the income from the Notes,  revenue for the period ended June 30,
1995 decreased  approximately  4% over the previous  fiscal year.  This decrease
resulted primarily from an 80% decrease in investment income,  which was due to:
1) the  Company  recognizing  more  realized  gains on the sales of  investments
during the prior year; and 2) the Company  implementing SFAS 115 "Accounting for
Certain  Investments in Debt and Equity  Securities"  ("SFAS 115") as of July 1,
1994 which  required  the Company to  recognize  unrealized  gains and losses on
investments  defined as trading  securities in the Company's  income  statement.
Approximately  $150,000 of unrealized losses on trading  securities are included
in earnings as of June 30, 1995.

     However, the Company had increases in advisory fee revenue of approximately
$382,000 due to increased assets under management. Additionally, fees associated
with the operation of the Transfer Agent increased approximately $177,000 due to
performing  increased  lock-box  and  printing  functions  for  USF as  well  as
providing transfer agency services to PSUSF and the Accolade Funds.

EXPENSES

     Exclusive of the expenses attributable to the purchase and financing of the
Notes as described  above,  expenses of the Company  increased less than 1% over
the previous fiscal year.

     Total  consolidated  expenses  for the  fiscal  year  ended  June 30,  1995
approximately  doubled from the  previous  fiscal  year.  This  increase was the
direct result of: 1) a non-recurring  non-cash charge of $5,375,269  relating to
the purchase of the Notes; 2) interest  expense of $5,650,020 on securities sold
to  broker-dealers  under  agreements to repurchase  the Notes;  and 3) interest
expense of  $433,136  on the  convertible  subordinated  debenture.  See further
discussion  of  the  purchase  of  the  Notes  and  the  Notes'  financing  with
broker-dealers and with the convertible  subordinated debenture following in the
"Liquidity and Capital Resources" section of Item 7 "Management's Discussion and
Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations" in this Form 10K.

LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES

DECEMBER 1994 MARLEAU, LEMIRE TRANSACTION

     Marleau,  Lemire Inc.  ("ML"),  a public company whose shares are traded on
the Toronto  Stock  Exchange and the Montreal  Exchange  (Symbol  "MRM"),  is an
investment  dealer in the small and mid-cap  Canadian  market,  with  offices in
Montreal,  Toronto,  Vancouver and Victoria. Through collaborative agreements ML
also has offices in Switzerland and Hong Kong.

     At the end of September  1994,  the Company and ML entered into a letter of
intent pursuant to which ML would purchase a significant  ownership  interest in
the Company.  On December 7, 1994,  the Company and ML entered into an agreement
whereby  the  Company  issued  to  ML  one  million  shares  of a new  class  of
convertible  non-voting  common stock (Class B) at $5.00 per share and a warrant
to purchase an additional one million shares of capital stock at $6.00 per share
in consideration  of an investment of $5 million.  The warrant allows ML, at its
option,  to purchase  either one million  shares of Class A Common  Stock or one
million  shares of Preferred  Stock at a price of $6.00 per share during the six
month  period  between  October  1, 1997 and March 31,  1998.  In  addition,  an
existing $6 million  subordinated  debenture  note of the Company held by ML was
amended so as to be convertible  at the option of ML into  Preferred  Stock at a
price of $7.00 per share.  The aggregate  number of shares of Preferred Stock ML
could purchase under the warrant,  by conversion with the promissory note and by
conversion of its Class B Common Stock is 2,857,142 shares.

     Preferred  shareholder approval for an increase in the number of authorized
shares of  Preferred  Stock is required so that the Company may have  sufficient
shares of Preferred  Stock in the event ML decides to convert its Class B shares
to shares of Preferred  Stock.  On August 3, 1995,  shareholders  approved a one
million share increase in the number of authorized shares of Preferred Stock.

     ML may not convert its Class B shares to Class A shares  until after mutual
fund shareholders  approve  continuation of the investment  advisory  agreements
with the Company in light of ML having voting  control.  Management  anticipates
seeking mutual fund shareholder approval sometime in 1996.

     The ML transaction includes a possible  change-in-control  for the Company.
As part  of the  transaction,  Mr.  Frank  E.  Holmes,  Chairman  and CEO of the
Company,  exchanged  72,720  shares of the  Company's  Class A Common  Stock for
164,347 shares of ML common stock. In addition,  subject to certain  conditions,
including  obtaining mutual fund shareholder  approvals in the future, the terms
of the agreement  require Mr.  Holmes to exchange an additional  177,280 Class A
common shares for 400,653  shares of ML, and ML to convert its Class B shares to
Class A  shares,  whereupon  ML  would  own  more  than  50% of the  issued  and
outstanding  voting  shares  of the  Company,  and Mr.  Holmes  would  then  own
approximately 3% of the total outstanding common shares of ML.

     A conversion  feature  allows ML to convert its Class B shares to Preferred
Stock,  which conversion would allow ML to sell said shares in a public offering
in the event  mutual  fund  shareholder  approval is not  obtained.  Mutual fund
shareholder  approval  is not  required  for  conversion  of Class B  shares  to
Preferred  Stock.  Alternatively,  in  the  event  Company  shareholders  do not
authorize  additional  Preferred  Stock and/or USF  shareholders  do not approve
continuation of the Advisory Agreement with ML owning control of the Company, ML
may opt, during  prescribed  periods in 1996 and 1997, to convert its investment
into a US $5 million  debenture  payable by USAI over a two-year period from the
date of ML's conversion. The interest rate on the debenture would be equal to an
annual rate of 1% plus the annual rate of interest  established by Bankers Trust
of New York for U.S. dollar commercial demand loans to its U.S. customers.

     The agreements also provided for certain other corporate action relating to
composition  of the Board of  Directors  and  continued  employment  of Frank E.
Holmes. (See Item 13 of this Form 10-K for further detail.)

     Shareholder value was enhanced by the ML transaction.  The market price for
the  Company's  Preferred  Stock on  December  7, 1994 was $3.25 per share.  The
Company's  book value per share prior to the  transaction  was $0.99;  and,  the
Company's book value per share after the transaction was $1.60. Of course,  with
more shares  outstanding,  Company earnings per share will be diluted;  however,
management  believes  that such  transactions  will  strategically  position the
Company to take  advantage of  opportunities  in an effort to build earnings and
shareholder value.

     The foregoing transactions have strengthened the Company's balance sheet by
increasing  its cash  position  and the book value per share.  The  relationship
allows the Company to grow its financial  services  business in the U.S., Canada
and  offshore,  and to enter new areas of  business  which  are  related  to the
Company's current business.

INVESTMENT IN JOINT VENTURE

     During  the  fiscal  year ended  June 30,  1994,  USAI and ML entered  into
discussions  with  respect to  potential  joint  enterprises.  Such  discussions
culminated in USAI and ML entering  into a joint  venture  agreement on July 20,
1994  whereby  USAI and ML are  undertaking  to offer  mutual  funds in  Canada,
primarily through ML's broker network located in Toronto,  Montreal,  Vancouver,
and  Victoria.  As part of the  agreement  to enter into a joint  venture,  USAI
issued 120,000 shares of its preferred  stock to ML. The estimated  value of the
stock upon issuance was $510,000,  which the Company  recorded as its investment
in the joint venture  during the first  quarter of fiscal 1995.  In  conjunction
with this  joint  venture,  United  Services  Advisors  Wealth  Management  Inc.
("USAWMI") was  incorporated  during the third quarter of fiscal 1995 with a 50%
ownership  to each USAI and ML.  Also,  USAI has  agreed  to incur  the  initial
organization and development costs,  including formation and registration of the
Canadian  mutual  funds up to a  maximum  of  $250,000  (Canadian)  for which an
additional  $8,073  USD was  spent  during  fiscal  1995 and with  approximately
$38,000 USD spent  subsequent  to June 30,  1995.  Management  anticipates  that
USAWMI,  through its  wholly-owned  subsidiary  United  Services  Advisors  Fund
Management  Inc.  which  was  formed in  September  1995 to  provide  investment
services to Canadian investors, will become the advisor to the ML Small Cap Fund
and will also offer other Canadian  funds and  investment  products and services
during fiscal 1996. Upon commencement of USAWMI operations, USAI's investment in
USAWMI will be accounted for under the equity method.

GOVERNMENT SECURITIES

     USG from its  inception  has invested  in, among other types of  Government
securities,  certain  Government agency notes whose interest rates reset monthly
based on a  cost-of-funds  index  ("Notes").  This reset feature lags changes in
short- term  interest  rates.  During fiscal 1995,  due to such  interest  rates
rising and regulatory  directives  issued to money market funds in general,  the
market value of the Notes  deteriorated.  To reduce USG's exposure to said Notes
and in order to maintain the confidence of our shareholders by assuring a stable
one dollar per share net asset  value,  USAI  decided,  in the first  quarter of
fiscal 1995, to arrange for USG to sell $40 million par amount of Notes at USG's
amortized  cost  of  approximately  $39,777,000  plus  accrued  interest  to ML.
Thereafter,  USAI decided to purchase  directly  from the fund  $90,525,000  par
amount of Notes  ($53,275,000  during  the  first  quarter  of  fiscal  1995 and
$37,250,000  during the third quarter of fiscal 1995) at USG's amortized cost of
approximately  $90,337,000 plus accrued  interest.  Additionally,  in connection
with  such  decision,  USAI  purchased  the  Notes  from  ML  for  approximately
$39,777,000  plus accrued  interest during the first quarter of fiscal 1995. The
$13,000,000  par value  Note which was to mature in  September  1995 was sold in
June 1995 for a realized loss of $32,073.  This note was sold in order to reduce
USAI's  future  cost of  financing  by  approximately  $50,000 and was sold near
enough the date of maturity that changes in market interest rates did not have a
significant effect on the security's fair value. The remaining Notes acquired by
USAI mature at their aggregate $117,525,000 par amount as follows: 

<TABLE>
<CAPTION>

                   MATURITY                           PAR VALUE

           October 1996-March 1997                  $ 63,725,000 
           July 1997                                $ 16,550,000 
           September 1997                           $ 37,250,000

</TABLE>

     USAI recorded the Notes at their fair value.  As the Notes had an aggregate
fair  value  of  approximately  $124,739,000  on the  dates  USAI  acquired  the
securities,  the Company  recorded  pre-tax  non-cash  charges to the results of
operations of approximately  $2,574,000  during the first quarter and $2,800,000
during the third quarter of fiscal 1995.  It is USAI's  intent,  and  management
believes the Company has the ability, to hold these Notes to maturity as defined
by SFAS 115; and therefore,  the Company  anticipates  ultimately  realizing the
Notes' approximate par value. Therefore in accordance with SFAS 115, the Company
has classified the Notes as  held-to-maturity  securities.  As a result,  and in
addition to periodic receipts of interest income, USAI recognized  $1,499,521 in
non-cash income during fiscal 1995 and anticipates  recognizing  non-cash income
in the future by accreting the discount to par value approximately as follows:

                                                    ===========

</TABLE>

     USAI financed the  acquisition of the Notes,  including  purchased  accrued
interest,  as follows:  1)  approximately  $120.9  million was provided by third
party broker-dealers under reverse repurchase agreements;  2) USAI issued a $6.0
million 8%  subordinated  debenture to ML, the terms of which require  principal
payments  as the Notes  mature and  interest  payments  quarterly  (see  further
discussion  under  CONVERTIBLE  SUBORDINATED  DEBENTURE);  and 3) USAI  utilized
approximately  $3,563,000  of its own cash.  Although it is USAI's  intent,  and
Management  believes  that the  Company  has the  ability to own the Notes until
maturity, under the terms of the subordinated debenture with ML, ML has retained
the right to acquire the Notes collateralizing the reverse repurchase agreements
with broker-dealers and the Company's  obligation under the debenture payable to
ML.

     During  calendar 1994 the Federal  Reserve Board raised  interest  rates to
address perceived  inflationary  pressures and could raise rates for such reason
in the  future.  Notwithstanding  the fact that the  coupon on the Notes  resets
every 30 days,  the Notes  have  been and may in the  future be priced to actual
maturity as opposed to the reset date due to the lagging index used to determine
the coupon rate. As a  consequence,  as interest rates increase the market value
of the Notes may decrease,  which could result in the  broker-dealers  under the
reverse repurchase agreements to request additional collateral. In addition, the
spread between  interest due to the  broker-dealers  and the interest earning on
the Notes with a lagging index may increase,  increasing the Company's  interest
expense. To reduce this risk the Company purchases Eurodollar puts.

     During fiscal 1995, USAI purchased put options on Eurodollar  futures which
expired resulting in a $231,625 loss. The options were purchased in an effort to
reduce  USAI's  exposure  to  temporary  declines  in the value of the Notes and
reduce USAI's  exposure to increased  interest  costs of the reverse  repurchase
agreements in the event of a significant increase in interest rates.

CONVERTIBLE SUBORDINATED DEBENTURE

     In conjunction with the purchase of the Notes described above,  USAI issued
a $6  million  8%  subordinated  debenture  to ML,  the  terms of which  require
principal  payments as the Notes mature and  quarterly  interest  payments.  The
debenture  was  amended in December  1994 to allow ML to convert  the  principal
balance into USAI Preferred Stock at $7.00 per share. In June 1995, USAI reduced
the principal  balance of the debenture by prepaying $1 million to ML and making
a payment  of  $465,788  to ML upon the sale of a $13  million  par value  Note.
Future  principal  payments  to be made over the next two years  based  upon the
amount  outstanding  at June 30, 1995 are $3,575,014 in fiscal 1997 and $959,198
in fiscal 1998 which are to be paid as the Notes mature.

INVESTMENT ACTIVITIES

     Management  believes  it can more  effectively  manage the  Company's  cash
position by broadening the types of investments utilized in cash management.  At
fiscal year end the Company  held  approximately  $2.977  million in  investment
securities  other than the Notes and money market mutual fund shares.  The value
of these investments is approximately  34% of stockholders'  equity at year-end.
Company  investments in marketable  securities  classified as trading securities
totaled  approximately  $1,510,000 (market value). Cost exceeded market value on
these securities by approximately $150,000. In addition, there was approximately
$1,467,000 in investments in securities  classified as available for sale. These
securities are primarily private  placements that Management expects will become
free-trading within one year. Fair value exceeded cost by approximately $356,000
before  tax.  During  fiscal  year  1995  net  realized  gains  from the sale of
investments  aggregated  approximately  $512,000  which excludes the sale of the
Note  in  June  and  sales  or  expirations  of  Eurodollar  puts,  compared  to
approximately   $1,383,000  for  fiscal  1994  and  $475,000  for  fiscal  1993.
Management  believes  that  such  activities  are in the  best  interest  of the
Company.  The activities are  scrutinized  by Company  compliance  personnel and
reported to investment advisory clients.

DEFERRED TAX ASSET

     SFAS No. 109  "Accounting  for Income  Taxes"  requires tax benefits of net
operating  losses,  book/tax  timing  differences,  and  various  tax credits be
recorded as a deferred  tax asset.  Upon  adoption of SFAS No. 109 in July 1993,
the Company  recorded a valuation  allowance  related to the deferred tax asset.
Late in fiscal 1994,  Management  re-evaluated  the valuation  allowance and the
likelihood  of  full  realization  of  the  deferred  tax  asset.  Based  on the
substantial increase in the amount of taxable income, Management determined that
the allowance was no longer necessary. Management has assessed the likelihood of
realization  of the  recorded  deferred  tax asset at June 30,  1995 to be "more
likely than not." Net operating  losses  ("NOLs") of $6.012  million,  primarily
resulting  from the non-cash  charge to earnings  related to the purchase of the
Notes during fiscal 1995, do not expire until fiscal 2007 and 2010. The discount
to par on the Notes will accrete to income for both book and taxable income over
the remaining  period to maturity.  Also, based on the current level of earnings
and Management's expectations for the future, Management believes that operating
income will "more likely than not" generate the minimum amount of future taxable
income  necessary  to fully  realize  the  deferred  tax  assets.  Additionally,
Management  believes  that the  Company has  certain  tax  planning  strategies,
including  the  sale  of  appreciated  marketable  securities,   that  could  be
implemented  to  supplement  taxable  income from  operations  in order to fully
realize the recorded tax benefits before expiration. Of course, future levels of
taxable gains from sales of marketable  securities  are dependent  upon economic
and market  conditions.  These factors are beyond the  Company's  control and no
assurance can be given that sufficient taxable income will be generated from the
sale of marketable securities for full utilization of the deferred tax assets.

     Further,  a change in  control  as defined  in the  Internal  Revenue  Code
("IRC")  could limit the  Company's  ability to fully  realize the  deferred tax
asset.  The Company  reviewed the IRC to determine  whether a  possibility  of a
change in control/ownership  existed upon issuance of shares and warrants to ML.
It was  determined  that the ML  transaction  does not  constitute  a change  in
control  under the IRC. If certain  changes in the  Company's  ownership  should
occur  subsequent to June 30, 1995,  there could be an annual  limitation on the
amount of NOLs that could be utilized.

FEE WAIVERS

     The Company has agreed to waive a portion of its fee revenues and/or to pay
for  expenses  of certain  mutual  funds for  purposes of  enhancing  the funds'
competitive  market  position.  Should  assets  of these  funds  increase,  fund
expenses  borne by the Company  would  increase to the extent that such expenses
would  exceed  any  expense  caps on any  mutual  fund,  the amount of which the
Company has agreed to bear. The Company expects to continue to waive fees and/or
pay for  fund  expenses  as long as  market  and  economic  conditions  warrant.
However,  subject to the  Company's  commitment to certain funds with respect to
fee waivers and expense  limitations,  the company may reduce the amount of fund
expenses it is bearing.

CONCLUSION

     At fiscal  year-end  the Notes  purchased  by the  Company  had an  average
maturity of less than two years. The Notes have a face value of $117.525 million
which is greater  than the  Company's  purchase  price.  As of June 30, 1995 the
Company had approximately $116.7 million in debt related to the Notes (comprised
of the $4.5 million  balance on the ML debenture and $112.2 million  advanced by
brokers pursuant to reverse repurchase agreement  transactions).  The ML note is
essentially  unsecured  with ML  looking  to the  collateral  under the  reverse
repurchase  agreements as its primary  source  payment.  The reverse  repurchase
agreements  with  the  broker-dealers  are  backed  with  collateral  valued  at
approximately $113 million.  The broker-dealers  have and continue to extend the
agreements;  however,  if all of the  broker-dealers  refused to roll-over their
repurchase  agreements there would be sufficient collateral to cover the brokers
and  there  would be  approximately  $800,000  to repay  the ML note,  leaving a
balance to ML of $3.7 million.  As of June 30, 1995, USAI had unrestricted  cash
and marketable  securities  with an aggregate  value of almost $4.3 million,  an
amount in excess of the debt related to the Notes.

     Based upon available  information and internal  analyses,  through the last
maturity date of the Notes,  Management  anticipates  positive cash flow and net
income in the related fiscal years,  which income will include accretion related
to the  Notes in excess  of the  non-cash  charge  discussed  above.  Management
believes  current  cash  reserves,  plus  financing  obtained and cash flow from
operations,  will be  sufficient  to meet  foreseeable  cash  needs  or  capital
necessary for the above  mentioned  activities,  as well as allow the Company to
take advantage of investment  opportunities  whenever available.  However, it is
difficult to predict  future  events and should cash flow be  insufficient,  the
Company  would seek  additional  sources of  financing  to meet  future  working
capital requirements.

ITEM 8. FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND SUPPLEMENTARY DATA.

                          INDEPENDENT AUDITOR'S REPORT

                        REPORT OF INDEPENDENT ACCOUNTANTS

To the Board of Directors
and Shareholders of
United Services Advisors, Inc.

     In  our  opinion,   the   accompanying   balance  sheets  and  the  related
consolidated  statements  of  operations,  cash flows and  shareholders'  equity
present  fairly,  in all material  respects,  the  financial  position of United
Services Advisors,  Inc. and its subsidiaries at June 30, 1995 and 1994, and the
results of their  operations and their cash flows for each of the three years in
the period ended June 30, 1995, in conformity with generally accepted accounting
principles.  These financial  statements are the responsibility of the Company's
management;  our  responsibility  is to express  an  opinion on these  financial
statements  based on our audits.  We conducted our audits of these statements in
accordance with generally accepted auditing standards which require that we plan
and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial
statements are free of material misstatement.  An audit includes examining, on a
test basis,  evidence  supporting  the amounts and  disclosures in the financial
statements,  assessing the accounting  principles used and significant estimates
made by management, and evaluating the overall financial statement presentation.
We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for the opinion  expressed
above.

As  discussed in Note B to the  financial  statements,  the Company  changed its
method of  accounting  for income  taxes during the year ended June 30, 1994 and
its method of accounting for  investments in debt and equity  securities  during
the year ended June 30, 1995.

                         UNITED SERVICES ADVISORS, INC.
                   NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

NOTE A. SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES.

ORGANIZATION

     United  Services  Advisors,  Inc.  ("the  Company")  serves  as  investment
advisor, investment manager and transfer agent to United Services Funds ("USF"),
a Massachusetts  business trust which is a no-load,  open-end investment company
offering  shares in numerous mutual funds to the investing  public.  The Company
has served as investment  adviser and manager since USF's  inception and assumed
the transfer agency  function in November 1984. For these services,  the Company
receives fees from USF.

     The Company has formed a limited  liability  company which was incorporated
in Guernsey on August 20, 1993. This company,  U.S. Advisors  (Guernsey) Limited
is manager of an off-shore fund. U.S. Advisors  (Guernsey) Limited has agreed to
waive fees and absorb all expenses of the  off-shore  fund except  custodian and
certain  directors'  fees until further  notice.  The cost of this  guarantee is
considered  immaterial at this time.  The Company  manages the portfolio of this
fund.

     The  Company  provides  administrative  and  transfer  agency  services  to
Pauze'/Swanson United Services Funds ("PSUSF"), a Massachusetts business trust.

     The  Company  is also the  investment  advisor  to the  Accolade  Funds,  a
Massachusetts  business trust. Accolade Funds is a management investment company
which offers shares of Bonnel Growth Fund, a no-load mutual fund.  Bonnel Growth
Fund  commenced  operations  in October  1994.  The Company  also  provides  the
transfer  agency  function  for which the Company  receives a fee from  Accolade
Funds.

     The Company has been named investment  advisor to United Services Insurance
Funds  ("USIF"),  a  Massachusetts  business  trust  formed  for the  purpose of
providing an investment  vehicle for variable annuity  products.  USIF currently
offers shares of the Schabacker  Select Fund through variable annuity  contracts
purchased by clients from  Integrity  Life  Insurance  Company.  USIF  commenced
operations in June 1995. Marleau, Lemire (USA), Inc. which occupies office space
supplied by the Company, acts as broker for the variable annuity company.

     During July 1994, USAI agreed to form a joint venture with Marleau,  Lemire
Inc. ("ML") of Montreal,  Quebec,  to offer mutual funds in Canada.  In February
1995,  United  Services  Wealth  Management  Co.  ("USAWMI"),  a Montreal  based
company, was formed.

     The  Company,  through  its  wholly-owned  subsidiary,   Security  Trust  &
Financial Company,  also serves as custodian for retirement accounts invested in
USF, PSUSF, and other mutual funds.

PRINCIPLES OF CONSOLIDATION

     The consolidated  financial  statements include the accounts of the Company
and its wholly-owned  subsidiaries,  United Shareholder Services, Inc. ("USSI"),
Security  Trust and Financial  Company  ("STFC" or "ST&FC"),  A&B Mailers,  Inc.
("A&B"),  and U.S.  Advisors  (Guernsey)  Limited  ("USAG").  Additionally,  the
Company has  consolidated  the balance  sheet and results of  operations  of the
Guernsey off-shore fund since it owned substantially all of the issued shares of
the Fund during fiscal 1995 and 1994. All significant inter-company balances and
transactions  have been eliminated in  consolidation.  Certain amounts have been
reclassified for comparative purposes.

CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS

     Cash consists of cash on hand and cash equivalents with original maturities
of three months or less. Cash and cash  equivalents at June 30, 1995 and at June
30, 1994 include  $2,673,156 and $1,006,151,  respectively,  in USF money market
mutual funds (see Note O). This  investment  is valued at  amortized  cost which
approximates  market. In addition,  not included in cash and cash equivalents is
restricted  cash of $315,000  and  $330,000 at June 30, 1995 and June 30,  1994,
respectively, which was held in a USF money market mutual fund and classified as
a restricted  investment  on the June 30, 1995 and 1994 balance  sheet (see Note
J).

FIXED ASSETS

     Fixed  assets  are  recorded  at  cost  including   capitalized   interest.
Depreciation  for owned fixed  assets and capital  leases is recorded  using the
straight-line  method over the  estimated  useful life of each asset as follows:
Leasehold improvements,  furniture,  and equipment are depreciated over 3 years;
capitalized  leased phone equipment is depreciated over 5 years and the building
is depreciated over 31.5 years.

INCOME TAXES

     Income taxes are provided during the year in which transactions  affect the
determination  of  financial  statement  income,  regardless  of when  they  are
recognized  for tax purposes.  Deferred  income taxes are provided for temporary
differences between the tax and book bases of assets and liabilities.

     Effective  July  1,  1993,  the  company  adopted  Statement  of  Financial
Accounting Standards No. 109, "Accounting for Income Taxes" (see Note B).

EARNINGS PER SHARE

     Primary  and fully  diluted  earnings  per share are based on the  weighted
average number of shares of Common stock and Preferred stock outstanding  during
the  year.  Common  and  Preferred  stock  are  considered   equivalent  in  the
calculation  of earnings per share since each share has  essentially  equivalent
interests in the income of the Company.  Preferred and Common stock warrants,  a
convertible debenture and options are included to the extent dilutive.

SECURITY INVESTMENTS

     Effective  July  1,  1994  the  Company  adopted   Statement  of  Financial
Accounting  Standards No. 115  "Accounting  for Certain  Investments in Debt and
Equity  Securities"  ("SFAS 115") (see Note B). Prior to  implementation of SFAS
115,  investments  in securities  were stated at the lower of aggregate  cost or
market. Realized gains (losses) from security transactions are calculated on the
first-in/first-out cost basis.

     Under SFAS 115, the Company  classifies its  investments in equity and debt
securities  into  three  categories.   Management   determines  the  appropriate
classification  of  securities  at the time of  purchase  and  reevaluates  such
designation as of each reporting period date.

     Securities  that are  purchased  and held  principally  for the  purpose of
selling them in the near term are classified as trading  securities and reported
at fair value.  Unrealized  gains and losses on these securities are included in
earnings.

     Investments  in debt  securities  for which the  Company  has the  positive
intent and  ability  to hold to  maturity  are  classified  as  held-to-maturity
securities. Held-to-maturity securities are reported at amortized cost. Discount
to par value is accreted,  and recognized as income,  over the remaining term to
maturity.

     Investments  not classified as trading  securities nor as  held-to-maturity
securities are classified as available-for-sale  securities and reported at fair
value.  Unrealized  gains  and  losses on these  securities  are  excluded  from
earnings and  reported,  net of tax, as a separate  component  of  shareholders'
equity.  Realized  gains and losses on sales of the  securities  are recorded in
earnings on trade date.

     Put options on Eurodollar  futures are accounted for on a  "mark-to-market"
basis.

     In 1994, the FASB issued SFAS 119, "Disclosure about Derivative Instruments
and  Fair  Value  of  Financial   Instruments".   This  pronouncement   requires
disclosures  related to the amounts,  nature, and terms of derivative  financial
instruments.  Additionally, SFAS 107, "Disclosures about Fair Value of Financial
Instruments",  requires disclosures of the fair value of financial  instruments.
The Company has elected not to adopt SFAS 119 or SFAS 107 until fiscal 1996. The
Company has not determined the effect of adopting SFAS 119 and 107.

FOREIGN CURRENCY TRANSACTIONS

     Transactions between the Company and foreign entities are converted to U.S.
dollars  using  the  exchange  rate on the  date of the  transactions.  Security
investments  valued in foreign  currencies are translated to U.S.  dollars using
the applicable  exchange rate as of June 30, 1995.  Foreign currency gain (loss)
is included as a component of investment income.

ORGANIZATION COSTS

     Organization costs in the amount of $14,509 and $24,005 net of amortization
at June 30, 1995, and 1994,  respectively,  which relate to the  organization of
STFC and USAG,  are  amortized on a  straight-line  basis over 60 months.  These
costs are included in other assets on the consolidated balance sheet.

NOTE B. CHANGE IN ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLE.

     In the  first  quarter  of  fiscal  1995,  the  Company  adopted  SFAS 115,
"Accounting for Certain  Investments in Debt and Equity  Securities,"  effective
July 1, 1994.  The  adoption of SFAS 115 changed  the method of  accounting  and
reporting for investments in equity  securities  that have readily  determinable
fair values and for all investments in debt securities.  The Company  recognized
the  cumulative  effect of adopting the  pronouncement  in the first  quarter of
fiscal  1995 as a change  in  accounting  principle.  The  financial  impact  of
adopting  SFAS 115 was a net  increase in  earnings of $43,284  (net of taxes of
$22,298)  or $.01 per share  representing  net  unrealized  gains on  securities
classified as trading  securities and $197,009 (net of taxes of $101,489) on net
unrealized  gains on  securities  classified  as  available  for sale  which was
reported as a separate component of equity.

     In the first  quarter of fiscal  1994,  the Company  adopted  Statement  of
Financial  Accounting  Standards  No. 109 ("SFAS 109"),  "Accounting  for Income
Taxes,"  effective  July 1, 1993. The adoption of SFAS 109 changed the Company's
method of accounting for income taxes from the deferred  method to the liability
method of  accounting  for deferred  income taxes.  Under the  liability  method
prescribed by SFAS 109,  deferred taxes are provided based upon enacted tax laws
and rates applicable to the periods in which taxes become payable.  As permitted
by SFAS 109, prior years'  financial  statements have not been restated to apply
the provisions of the new method.  The Company  recognized the cumulative effect
of adopting the pronouncement in the first quarter of fiscal 1994 as a change in
accounting  principle.  The cumulative effect of adoption on July 1, 1993 was to
increase deferred tax assets by $200,420.  This amount primarily represented the
impact of  recognizing  the benefit of a net operating loss carryover that could
not be recorded under the previous  method of accounting for income taxes.  This
increased net income in fiscal year 1994 by $200,420 or $.03 per share.

NOTE C.  INVESTMENTS.

     As discussed in Notes A and B, in fiscal 1995 the Company adopted SFAS 115,
which changed the method of accounting  and reporting for  investments in equity
securities that have readily determinable fair values and for all investments in
debt securities.

     The cost and market value of investments  classified as trading at June 30,
1995  was  $1,661,113  and  $1,510,316  respectively.  The  net  change  in  the
unrealized  holding  loss on trading  securities  held at June 30, 1995 that has
been included in earnings for the period was $150,797.

     The  cost  of   investments   in   securities,   which  are  classified  as
available-for-sale,  which may not be readily  marketable  at June 30,  1995 was
$1,122,992.  These  investments are reflected as non-current  assets on the June
30, 1995 consolidated balance sheet. These investments are in private placements
which  are  restricted  for  sale as of June 30,  1995.  It is  anticipated  the
securities  obtained in these private placements will become free trading during
fiscal  1996.  The  estimated  fair  value  of  the  investments  classified  as
available-for-sale  at June 30, 1995 was $1,466,622  with $343,630 in unrealized
gains being recorded as a separate component of Shareholders'  Equity as of June
30, 1995.  Approximately  $12,000 was also included in Shareholders'  Equity for
unrealized gains on short sales by the Company.  During fiscal 1995, the Company
recorded  realized gains of $202,441,  on securities which were transferred from
available-for-sale  securities to trading securities upon becoming free trading.
The Company also recorded  unrealized gains of $158,498 and unrealized losses of
$188,124 on securities which were transferred from available-for-sale securities
to trading securities upon becoming free trading during the year.

     Additionally,   the  Company   holds  Notes  with  an  amortized   cost  of
$113,260,361 which are classified as held-to-maturity  securities.  (See further
discussion of these securities at Note F.)

     In September 1994, subsequent to USAI's purchase of Notes discussed in Note
F to the Consolidated Financial Statements,  the Company and USF entered into an
agreement,  under which USAI agreed to transfer  $900,000 in cash and securities
into an account at a financial  institution  in the name of USAI for the benefit
of USG under the control of USF's independent  Trustees.  Under the terms of the
agreement,  these assets may be drawn upon by USF, if necessary,  to continue to
maintain the Fund's net asset value per share at $1.00. The agreement terminates
the earlier of 1) when USG no longer owns any of the  variable  rate  government
agency Notes set forth under the  agreement;  or 2) October 1997.  Collateral of
$500,000 was returned to the Company  during the year ended June 30, 1995 due to
the reduced  percentage of USG's net assets  invested in the Notes in accordance
with  the  agreement.   These  assets  are  classified  as  part  of  Restricted
Investments in the consolidated balance sheet.

     Restricted investments include cash of $ 76,604 and $120,000 held in margin
accounts at brokers at June 30, 1995 and June 30, 1994, respectively.

     Prior to the implementation of SFAS 115,  marketable  securities which were
classified as current assets at June 30, 1994 consisted of the following:

</TABLE>
         
     Net realized  gains on sales of securities  of $1,383,246  and $456,405 are
included in fiscal 1994 and 1993 investment income,  respectively.  Market value
of these investments exceeded cost at June 30, 1994 and June 30, 1993.

     The cost of investments in securities  which may not be readily  marketable
at June 30, 1994 was $1,058,750. These investments, which were recorded at cost,
were reflected as non-current  assets on the June 30, 1994 consolidated  balance
sheet.  These  investments were in private  placements which were restricted for
sale as of June 30, 1994.  These private  placements  became free trading during
the fiscal year ended June 30, 1995.  Management  determined that the fair value
of these investments exceeded cost as of June 30, 1994.

NOTE D.  INVESTMENT MANAGEMENT, TRANSFER AGENT AND OTHER FEES.

     The Company  serves as investment  advisor to USF and is transfer  agent to
USF.  For  these  services  the  Company  receives  fees  based  on a  specified
percentage  of net  assets  under  management  and  the  number  of  shareholder
accounts.  The Company also provides  in-house legal and accounting  services to
USF. The accounting  services are provided to USF for an annual fee. The Company
also  receives  exchange,  maintenance,  closing and small account fees directly
from USF shareholders.

     The Company also provides  administrative  services to PSUSF; is investment
advisor and transfer agent to Accolade Funds; and is the investment  advisor and
transfer agent to USIF.

     USAI  receives  additional  revenue from several  sources  including:  STFC
custodian  and  administrative  fee  revenues,  gains on  marketable  securities
transactions,  revenues from miscellaneous  transfer agency activities including
lockbox functions as well as mailroom operations (A&B).

     Investment advisory fees, transfer agency fees,  accounting fees, custodian
fees and all other fees to the Company are recorded as income  during the period
in which services are performed.

     The Company has  voluntarily  waived or lowered  its  advisory  fees and is
bearing expenses on several funds within USF as follows:

     The Company has  unconditionally  guaranteed  that the total fund operating
expenses (as a percentage of average net assets) of the U.S. Tax Free Fund,  the
United Services Intermediate Treasury Fund, and the United Services Special-Term
Government  Fund will not exceed 0.40% on an  annualized  basis through June 30,
1996 or such later date as the Company determines.

     The Company has  unconditionally  guaranteed  that the total fund operating
expenses (as a percentage  of average net assets) of the U.S. All American  Fund
and the United  Services  Near-Term  Tax Free Fund will not  exceed  0.70% on an
annualized  basis  through  June  30,  1996 or such  later  date as the  Company
determines.

     The Company has  unconditionally  guaranteed  that the total fund operating
expenses  (as a  percentage  of  average  net  assets)  of the  U.S.  Government
Securities  Savings Fund will not exceed 0.40% on an  annualized  basis  through
June 30, 1997 or such later date as the Company determines.

     The Company has  unconditionally  guaranteed  that the total fund operating
expenses (as a percentage of average net assets) of the China Region Opportunity
Fund will not exceed  1.95% on an  annualized  basis  through  June 30, 1995 and
2.25% on an  annualized  basis  through  June 30, 1996 or such later date as the
Company determines.

     The  aggregate  amount of fees  waived or expenses  voluntarily  reimbursed
totalled  $3,568,151,  $4,190,821 and $2,380,801 in fiscal 1995, 1994, and 1993,
respectively. The Company also reimbursed $0, $14,234, and $-0- in the aggregate
for  each of the  three  fiscal  years  ended  June  30,  1995,  1994,  and 1993
respectively,  to the funds for expenses in excess of state statutory limitation
requirements.

     The  following  funds  accounted  for more than 10% of  revenue  (excluding
government security income) in the years indicated:

     Receivables  from mutual funds represent  amounts due the Company,  and its
wholly-owned  subsidiaries,  for investment  advisory fees, transfer agent fees,
accounting fees, and exchange fees, net of amounts payable to the mutual funds.

     The investment  advisory contract and related contracts between the Company
and USF expire on or about October 25, 1995. Management anticipates the Trustees
of USF will renew the contracts.

</TABLE>

     At June 30, 1995 and 1994 accumulated  amortization for capitalized  leased
equipment  was $450,303 and  $325,105,  respectively.  Amortization  expense for
capitalized leased equipment was $125,198,  $116,391 and $129,986 for the fiscal
years ended June 30, 1995, 1994 and 1993,  respectively.  Minimum lease payments
required  by  obligations  under  capital  leases are $93,658 in fiscal 1996 and
$24,354 in fiscal 1997.

     On February  28,  1992,  the Company  acquired a 46,000  square foot office
building  with  approximately  2.5  acres  of land  from  the  Resolution  Trust
Corporation.  As of June 30, 1993, total  capitalized  costs associated with the
building are  approximately  $2.2  million,  including  capitalized  interest of
$33,783,  closing costs and improvements.  The Company moved its headquarters to
this building  during August and September of 1992. The Company made  additional
substantial  improvements  to the  building in order to  accommodate  this move.
Depreciation  on the building and  improvements  commenced upon  occupancy.  The
building is pledged as collateral for the financing used to acquire the building
(see Note I).

NOTE F.  GOVERNMENT SECURITIES.

     The U.S.  Government  Securities Savings Fund ("USG"), a USF fund, from its
inception has invested in, among other types of Government  securities,  certain
Government   agency  notes  whose  interest  rates  reset  monthly  based  on  a
cost-of-funds  index  ("Notes").  This reset  feature lags changes in short-term
interest  rates. To reduce USG's exposure to said Notes and in order to maintain
a $1.00 per share net asset value, USAI decided,  in the first quarter of fiscal
1995,  to  arrange  for USG to sell $40  million  par  amount  of Notes at USG's
amortized  cost  of  approximately  $39,777,000  plus  accrued  interest  to ML.
Thereafter,  USAI decided to purchase  directly  from the fund  $90,525,000  par
amount of Notes  ($53,275,000  during  the  first  quarter  of  fiscal  1995 and
$37,250,000  during the third quarter of fiscal 1995) at USG's amortized cost of
approximately  $90,337,000 plus accrued  interest.  Additionally,  in connection
with  such  decision,  USAI  purchased  the  Notes  from  ML  for  approximately
$39,777,000  plus accrued  interest during the first quarter of fiscal 1995. The
$13,000,000  par value  Note which was to mature in  September  1995 was sold in
June 1995 for a realized loss of $32,073.  This note was sold in order to reduce
USAI's  future  cost of  financing  by  approximately  $50,000 and was sold near
enough the date of maturity that changes in market interest rates did not have a
significant effect on the security's fair value. The remaining Notes acquired by
USAI mature at their aggregate $117,525,000 par amount as follows:

                     July 1997                         $ 16,550,000
                     September 1997                    $ 37,250,000

</TABLE>

     USAI recorded the Notes at their fair value.  As the Notes had an aggregate
fair  value  of  approximately  $124,739,000  on the  dates  USAI  acquired  the
securities,  the Company  recorded  pre-tax  non-cash  charges to the results of
operations of approximately  $2,574,000  during the first quarter and $2,800,000
during the third quarter of fiscal 1995.  It is USAI's  intent,  and  management
believes the Company has the ability, to hold these Notes to maturity as defined
by SFAS 115; and therefore,  the Company  anticipates  ultimately  realizing the
Notes' approximate par value. Therefore in accordance with SFAS 115, the Company
has classified the Notes as  held-to-maturity  securities.  As a result,  and in
addition to periodic receipts of interest income, USAI recognized  $1,499,521 in
non-cash income during fiscal 1995 and anticipates  recognizing  non-cash income
in the future by accreting the discount to par value approximately as follows:

</TABLE>

     USAI financed the  acquisition of the Notes,  including  purchased  accrued
interest,  as follows:  1)  approximately  $120.9  million was provided by third
party broker-dealers  under reverse repurchase  agreements (see Note K); 2) USAI
issued a $6.0  million  8%  subordinated  debenture  to ML,  the  terms of which
require principal  payments as the Notes mature and interest payments  quarterly
(see Note M); and 3) USAI  utilized  approximately  $3,563,000  of its own cash.
Although it is USAI's intent,  and Management  believes that the Company has the
ability to own the Notes  until  maturity,  under the terms of the  subordinated
debenture   with  ML,  ML  has   retained   the  right  to  acquire   the  Notes
collateralizing  the reverse repurchase  agreements with  broker-dealers and its
obligation under the debenture payable to ML.

     During fiscal 1995,  USAI  purchased put options on Eurodollar  futures for
approximately  $274,125 in premiums which expired  resulting in a $231,625 loss.
The options were  purchased with the  expectation  that they would reduce USAI's
exposure  to  temporary  declines  in the value of the Notes and  reduce  USAI's
exposure to increased interest costs of the reverse repurchase agreements in the
event of a significant  increase in interest rates. During the fourth quarter of
Fiscal  1995,   USAI  purchased  35  put  options  on  Eurodollar   futures  for
approximately  $13,700 in premiums  which expire in September  1995 which reduce
the risk of declines in the value of the Notes held by approximately  13%. These
options  are  accounted  for  on  a   "mark-to-market"   basis  with  unrealized
appreciation  of $3,763  included  in the  results of  operations.  The  options
purchased are exchange  traded and require no cash  requirements  other than the
initial  premiums  and USAI's  exposure on the options is limited to the initial
premium invested.

NOTE G.  RESIDUAL EQUITY INTEREST.

     In June 1992 the  Company  made its final  payment to the  Settlement  Pool
established  under the June 1988 Settlement  Agreement  relating to the original
Prospector  Fund (now  operating as the U.S.  Global  Resources  Fund);  and the
Settlement Pool made the final payout to "Eligible Shareholders" thereof in June
1992.  Under the 1988  Settlement  Agreement,  any amounts  payable to "Eligible
Shareholders"  who cannot be located,  together with interest  thereon,  will be
held  for six  years  after  the  final  payout  against  the  claims  of  those
shareholders.  At the end of six years,  such amounts will be made  available to
all persons claiming subrogation.  The Company has first right of subrogation to
the amounts. The amount of cash currently being held is approximately  $586,000.
Management  believes  the Company  will receive a sum which will equal or exceed
the  amount  currently  recorded  as the  Company's  residual  equity  interest,
$217,861.

NOTE H. INVESTMENT IN JOINT VENTURE.

     During  the  fiscal  year  ended  June 30,  1994,  USAI and ML, a  Canadian
brokerage  firm,  entered  into  discussions  with  respect to  potential  joint
enterprises.  Such  discussions  culminated in USAI and ML entering into a joint
venture  agreement on July 20, 1994 whereby USAI and ML are undertaking to offer
mutual  funds in  Canada,  primarily  through  ML's  broker  network  located in
Toronto,  Montreal,  Vancouver,  and Victoria. As part of the agreement to enter
into a joint venture,  USAI issued 120,000 shares of its preferred  stock to ML.
The estimated  value of the stock upon issuance was $510,000,  which the Company
recorded as its  investment  in the joint  venture  during the first  quarter of
fiscal 1995. In conjunction  with this joint venture,  United Services  Advisors
Wealth Management Inc.  ("USAWMI") was incorporated  during the third quarter of
fiscal 1995 with a 50%  ownership to each USAI and ML. Also,  USAI has agreed to
incur the initial  organization and development costs,  including  formation and
registration of the Canadian mutual funds up to a maximum of $250,000 (Canadian)
for  which  an  additional   $8,073  USD  was  spent  during  fiscal  1995  with
approximately  $38,000  USD  spent  subsequent  to  June  30,  1995.  Management
anticipates  that USAWMI through its  wholly-owned  subsidiary  United  Services
Advisors Fund  Management  Inc.,  which was formed in September  1995 to provide
investment  services  to Canadian  investors,  will become the advisor to the ML
Small Cap Fund and will also offer other Canadian funds and investment  products
and services during fiscal 1996. Upon commencement of USAWMI operations,  USAI's
investment in USAWMI will be accounted for under the equity method.

NOTE I. NOTE PAYABLE.

     To  facilitate  the  cost of  acquiring  the  building  and  the  necessary
improvements, the Company obtained permanent financing from a bank in the amount
of $1,425,000.  On June 30, 1994, the Company  re-financed the original building
loan with another bank on more favorable terms. As of June 30, 1995, the balance
on the note was $1,340,048.  The loan is currently amortizing over a twenty year
period with payments of both principal and interest due monthly based on a fixed
rate of 7.75%.  The current  monthly  payment is $11,750.  The loan matures July
2001.  Under  this  agreement,  the  Company  must  maintain  certain  financial
covenants.  Because of events described in Note F, the Company obtained a waiver
of the covenants from the bank through June 30, 1995 and subsequently negotiated
an amendment to the loan  agreement and covenants with the bank to cover periods
beyond June 30,  1995.  The Company is  currently  in  compliance  with all loan
covenants.

     Future principal  payments to be made over the next five years based on the
amount outstanding at June 30, 1995 are as follows:

NOTE J. ANNUITY AND CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS.

     On  February 6, 1989,  the Company  entered  into an  agreement  with Clark
Aylsworth  ("Aylsworth")  related to his  retirement on December 31, 1988.  This
agreement  provided for the payment to Aylsworth of a monthly  annuity of $1,500
for the remainder of his life or his wife's life, if he predeceases  her. During
fiscal 1989,  $179,787 was charged to income to record the estimated  fair value
of this  transaction,  which  approximated the present value of future estimated
payments.

     On    December     30,    1990,     the    Company     entered    into    a
non-compete/non-interference agreement, an executory contract, pursuant to which
it pays the Aylsworths $4,500 monthly, such amount to continue for the longer of
Aylsworth's  or his  wife's  life.  The  Company  recorded a charge to income in
fiscal year 1991 of $70,803,  which represented the fair value of the obligation
for estimate future payment to Mrs. Aylsworth which assume continued  compliance
with  contractual  covenants  and,  in light of  actuarial  estimates,  that she
outlives  Mr.  Aylsworth.  The  Company  placed  $360,000 in escrow to cover the
Company's  obligation to the  Aylsworths if the Company  defaults.  The escrowed
amount decreases $15,000 annually.

     During fiscal 1993, the Company  evaluated the amount recorded  relating to
the above obligations. The Company determined that the executory contract should
be expensed as payments are made,  with no provision  for future  payments,  and
that the amount  recorded  for the 1989  annuity was  increased  in fiscal 1993.
Therefore,  the amount recorded for these  obligations is attributed only to the
1989 annuity.

NOTE K. SECURITIES SOLD UNDER AGREEMENTS TO REPURCHASE.

     As  discussed  in Note F, USAI  financed  the  acquisition  of the Notes by
entering   into   agreements   to   repurchase   securities   with  third  party
broker-dealers.  The terms  with the  broker-dealers  provide  that the  reverse
repurchase agreements must be collateralized by the Notes and/or cash. The Notes
described in Note F are held by the  broker-dealers  as  collateral.  Throughout
fiscal 1995, and as of September 15,1995,  each reverse repurchase agreement has
matured and has been renewed on a 30, 60, or 90 day basis.  Management  believes
that the reverse  repurchase  agreements can be  periodically  renewed until the
Notes mature.  All reverse repurchase  agreements are with major  broker-dealers
and are  secured by U.S.  Government  Agency  obligations.  The  following  is a
summary  of  information  as of June  30,  1995  on the  securities  sold  under
agreements to repurchase and the repurchase liability:

<TABLE>

</TABLE>

     The amount at risk,  defined as the greater of the market value or carrying
amount plus the accrued coupon  interest less the  repurchase  liability and the
interest due to the broker-dealer on the repurchase liability, under the reverse
repurchase agreements with Dean Witter Reynolds Inc. exceed 10% of shareholder's
equity. The amount at risk was $1,058,657 and the reverse repurchase  agreements
had maturities of 87 days as of June 30, 1995.

NOTE L. BENEFIT PLANS.

     The Company and its subsidiaries have a contributory profit-sharing plan in
which all qualified employees who have completed one year of employment with the
Company  are  included.  The  amount of the annual  contribution,  which may not
exceed 15% of earnings before income taxes, is determined by the Company's Board
of Directors. At June 30, 1995, the Company has no accrual for fiscal 1995.

     The Company and its  subsidiaries  also have a savings and investment  plan
qualified  under Section 401(k) of the Internal  Revenue Code. The Company makes
contributions  on behalf of eligible  employees to fund this plan. In connection
with this 401(k) Plan,  participants  can  voluntarily  contribute  up to 15% of
their  compensation to this plan, and the Company will match their  contribution
up to 2%. At June 30, 1995,  the Company has accrued  $48,000 for this  matching
contribution.

     Additionally,  effective  February 1, 1993, the Company began  self-funding
its employee health care plan. The Company has obtained  reinsurance with both a
specific and an aggregate stop-loss in the event of catastrophic claims. At June
30, 1995, the Company has accrued an amount  representing the Company's estimate
of incurred but not reported claims.

NOTE M. CONVERTIBLE SUBORDINATED DEBENTURE.

     In  conjunction  with the  purchase of the Notes  described in Note F, USAI
issued a $6 million 8% subordinated  debenture to ML, the terms of which require
principal payments as the Notes mature and quarterly interest payments.  In June
1995,  USAI  reduced the  principal  balance of the  debenture  by  prepaying $1
million to ML and making a payment  of  $465,788  to ML upon the sale of the $13
million par value Note.  Future principal  payments to be made over the next two
years  based upon the amount  outstanding  at June 30,  1995 are  $3,575,014  in
fiscal 1997 and $959,198 in fiscal  1998,  which will be paid to ML as the Notes
mature.

     Additionally,  due to the transaction between USAI and ML described in Note
N,  the  debenture  agreement  between  USAI  and  ML  was  amended  so as to be
convertible  at the  option  of ML into  preferred  stock at a cost of $7.00 per
share for each dollar of par value outstanding.

NOTE N. SHAREHOLDERS' EQUITY.

     In a private  placement on October 27,  1989,  Frank E. Holmes and the F.E.
Holmes  Organization,  Inc.  acquired  control of the Company by purchasing  for
$2,200,000  550,000 shares of the Company's Common stock and warrants to acquire
an additional  550,000 shares of Common stock at $4.00 per share. These warrants
include a provision for  adjustment to the number of warrants and exercise price
in the event  additional  securities  are issued at an amount below the exercise
price of such  outstanding  warrants.  At June 30, 1994,  there were outstanding
Common stock  warrants to purchase  586,122  shares at $3.75 per share  expiring
October 1994.  Effective  August 11, 1994 such  warrants were  cancelled and new
agreements  were approved  providing for warrants to acquire  586,122  shares of
common  stock at the August 11,  1994 market  price of $4.00 per share  expiring
October 1999 which were all outstanding as of June 30, 1995.

     In December  1991,  the Company  issued to Mr.  Holmes  options to purchase
400,000 shares of Common stock at $2.625 per share which equaled or exceeded the
fair value of the stock on the date of grant.  During fiscal 1992,  the Board of
Directors  approved  the issuance of 100,000  shares of Preferred  stock to F.E.
Holmes  Organization,  Inc. in exchange for 100,000  shares of its Common stock.
Mr.  Holmes  now owns  approximately  68.27%  of the  outstanding  shares of the
Company's  Common stock,  which is the only class of the Company's  stock having
voting rights.

     During fiscal 1993,  warrants  covering  750,000 shares of Preferred  stock
were exercised,  and warrants covering 80,957 shares of Preferred stock expired.
At June 30, 1993,  1994 and 1995 the Company had no outstanding  Preferred stock
warrants.

     In March 1985,  the Board of Directors  adopted an  Incentive  Stock Option
Plan (the "1985  Plan"),  amended in  November  1989 and  December  1991,  which
provides for the granting of options to purchase 200,000 shares of the Company's
Preferred  stock, at or above fair market value,  to certain  executives and key
salaried  employees of the Company and its subsidiaries.  Options under the 1985
Plan may be granted for a term of up to five years in the case of employees  who
own in excess of 10% of the total  combined  voting  power of all classes of the
Company's stock and up to ten years for other employees.  During the 1991 fiscal
year,  options covering 150,000 shares of Preferred stock were granted at prices
ranging  from  $1.50 to $1.65.  During the fiscal  year 1994,  options  covering
10,500 shares were granted at an exercise  price of $4.25 per share.  During the
fiscal year 1995, options covering 42,500 shares were granted at exercise prices
ranging from $2.625 to $4.50 per share.  As of June 30, 1995,  options  covering
79,000  shares  have been  exercised  and  options  covering  5,000  shares have
expired.  The 1985 plan expired December 31, 1994; as a consequence,  there will
be no further option grants under the 1985 plan.

     In November  1989,  the Board of Directors  adopted the 1989  Non-Qualified
Stock Option Plan (the "1989 Plan"),  amended in December  1991,  which provides
for the  granting  of  options  to  purchase  800,000  shares  of the  Company's
Preferred  stock to  directors,  officers  and  employees of the Company and its
subsidiaries.  Since adoption of the 1989 Plan,  options for 780,000 shares were
granted  at prices  ranging  from  $1.50 to $5.69 per  share,  which  equaled or
exceeded  the fair market  value at date of grant.  During the fiscal year 1993,
options covering 5,000 shares were granted at an exercise price of $3.00. During
the fiscal year 1994,  options  covering  22,000 shares were granted at exercise
prices  ranging  from  $4.75 to $5.69 per share.  During  the  fiscal  year 1995
options  covering  7,000  shares were  granted at exercise  prices  ranging from
$2.625 to $3.375 per share. As of June 30, 1995, options covering 252,500 shares
have been  exercised  under this plan and  options  covering  4,700  shares have
expired.

     Preferred stock options outstanding as of June 30, 1995 under the 1989 Plan
are as follows:

</TABLE>

     On a per share basis,  the holders of the Common  stock and the  non-voting
Preferred  stock  participate  equally in dividends as declared by the Company's
Board of Directors, with the exception that any dividends declared must first be
paid to the holders of the Preferred  stock to the extent of 5% of the Company's
after-tax prior year net earnings.

     The holders of the Preferred stock have a liquidation  preference  equal to
the par value of $.05 per  share.  Certain  Common  stock is  exchangeable  on a
one-for-one basis for Preferred stock.

     During fiscal year ended June 30, 1995, the Company purchased 35,000 shares
of its  preferred  stock on the open  market  at an  average  price of $3.06 per
share.

     At the end of September  1994,  the Company and ML entered into a letter of
intent pursuant to which ML would purchase a significant  ownership  interest in
the Company.  On December 7, 1994,  the Company and ML entered into an agreement
whereby the Company  issued to ML one million shares of new class of convertible
non-voting  common stock (Class B) at $5.00 per share and warrant to purchase an
additional   one  million  shares  of  capital  stock  at  $6.00  per  share  in
consideration  of an  investment  of $5 million.  The warrant  allows ML, at its
option,  to purchase  either one million  shares of Class A Common  Stock or one
million  shares of Preferred  Stock at a price of $6.00 per share during the six
month  period  between  October  1, 1997 and March 31,  1998.  In  addition,  an
existing $6 million subordinated debenture of the Company held by ML was amended
so as to be convertible  at the option of ML into Preferred  Stock at a price of
$7.00 per share.  The  aggregate  number of shares of  Preferred  Stock ML could
purchase  under the  warrant,  by  conversion  with the  promissory  note and by
conversion of its Class B Common Stock is 2,857,142 shares.

     Preferred  shareholder approval for an increase in the number of authorized
shares of  Preferred  Stock is required so that the Company may have  sufficient
shares of Preferred  Stock in the event ML decides to convert its Class B shares
to shares of Preferred Stock. On August 3, 1995, USAI  shareholders  approved an
amendment to the Company's  Restated Articles of Incorporation  providing for an
increase  in the  number  of shares  of  Preferred  Stock  that the  Company  is
authorized to issue by one million shares.

     ML can only  convert its Class B shares to Class A shares after mutual fund
shareholders approve continuation of the investment advisory agreements with the
Company  because  the  agreements  contain  a  statutory  contractual  provision
providing  for  automatic  termination  upon  an  assignment  of the  investment
advisory  agreement.  Such  conversion  would be deemed a change in control and,
thereby, an assignment of the contract.

     As part of the  transaction,  Mr. Frank E. Holmes,  Chairman and CEO of the
Company, exchanged 72,720 shares of the Company Class A Common Stock for 164,347
shares of ML common stock. In addition, subject to certain conditions, including
obtaining  mutual fund  shareholder  approvals  in the future,  the terms of the
agreement  require Mr. Holmes to exchange an  additional  177,280 Class A common
shares for 400,653 shares of ML, and ML to convert its Class B shares to Class A
shares,  whereupon  ML would own more  that 50% of the  issued  and  outstanding
voting shares of the Company,  and Mr. Holmes would then own approximately 3% of
the total outstanding common shares of ML.

     The  conversion  feature  allowing  ML to  convert  its  Class B shares  to
Preferred  Stock would allow ML to sell said shares in a public  offering in the
event mutual fund shareholder  approval is not obtained.  Alternatively,  in the
event Company  Shareholders do not authorize  additional  Preferred Stock and/or
mutual fund shareholders do not approve  continuation of the Advisory  Agreement
with ML owning control of the Company,  ML may opt, during prescribed periods in
1996 and 1997, to convert its investment to a US $5 million debenture payable by
USAI over a two-year period from the date of ML's conversion.  The interest rate
on the debenture  would be equal to an annual rate of 1% plus the annual rate of
interest  established  by Bankers Trust of New York for U.S.  dollar  commercial
demand loans to its U.S. customers.

     As discussed  in Note P, certain  changes in the  Company's  ownership  may
result in a limitation on the amount of net operating losses ("NOLs") that could
be utilized under Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code. The Company reviewed
Section 382 and has determined that no change in  control/ownership,  as defined
by Section 382, occurred as a result of the fiscal 1995  transactions  described
above.

NOTE O. RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS.

     In addition to the  Company's  receivable  from USF relating to  investment
management,  transfer  agent  and  other  fees (see  Note D),  the  Company  had
$2,673,156 and $1,006,151  invested in USF money market mutual funds at June 30,
1995 and 1994,  respectively.  Dividend income earned from these  investments in
USF totaled  $132,881,  $47,739  and $71,266 for the years ended June 30,  1995,
1994 and 1993 respectively.

     The Company and USF's  contract with Bankers Trust Company  ("Sub-Advisor")
to provide sub-advisory  services for certain USF funds was terminated effective
November 21, 1993. As compensation  for its services,  the Sub-Advisor  received
from the  Manager a fee  based  upon the  average  net  assets of the fund.  The
Manager  incurred  $12,500 and $26,402 in sub-  advisory  fees to Bankers  Trust
during the 1994 and 1993 fiscal  years,  respectively,  including $0, and $2,500
payable at June 30, 1994 and 1993, respectively.

     In connection  with ML's  investment in the Company as described in Note N,
the Company's Board of Directors was expanded from five to nine and includes two
ML  representatives  (including ML's Chairman and CEO); and, Mr. Holmes has been
elected to ML's Board of  Directors.  During the fiscal year ended June 30, 1995
USAI  purchased  approximately  105,000 shares of ML common stock through USAI's
brokerage account at Marleau,  Lemire Securities Inc.,  ("MLSI") a subsidiary of
ML for  $181,778.  After a 1 for 3 reverse  stock  split on June 23, 1995 USAI's
position in ML common stock was converted to  approximately  35,000 shares which
represents less than 1% of the ML common shares outstanding.

     At various  intervals  during  fiscal 1995,  the Company  purchased 700 put
options on Eurodollar  futures for premiums of $165,375 through Marleau,  Lemire
Futures which is a division of MLSI. The Company also purchased securities which
MLSI was either the agent or underwriter of the share  offering.  The securities
were  purchased  at a cost of  $199,609  and had  $58,120 of  unrealized  losses
included in the Company's  income  statement as of June 30, 1995.  Additionally,
the Company  purchased a security for $110,685  for which  Griffiths  McBurney &
Partners acted as Agent. Eugene McBurney,  a director of USAI from December 1994
to July 1995, is a partner in Griffiths McBurney & Partners. Mr. Renaud became a
director  of the  Company in December  1994.  At June 30,  1994 a $100,000  loan
receivable between USAI and Hornchurch Investments Limited was outstanding. Loan
proceeds were used by Hornchurch to purchase a debenture issued by Weider Europe
B.V., an entity in which Mr.  Renaud had a material  interest.  During  November
1994 the loan was repaid to USAI along with  interest  due, and USAI  recognized
approximately   $80,000  in  income  as  a  result  of   receiving  a  pro  rata
participation in the equity appreciation of the Hornchurch/Weider transactions.

     As  of  June  30,  1995,  USAI  has  accrued   approximately   $113,000  in
subordinated debenture interest payable to ML.

     There were additional related party transactions  involving ML related to a
joint  venture to market mutual funds in Canada (see Note H) and the purchase of
U.S. Government securities (see Note F).

NOTE P. INCOME TAXES.

     As discussed in Note B, in fiscal 1994 the Company  adopted SFAS 109, which
changed the method of accounting for income taxes.

     The  differences  in income taxes  attributable  to  continuing  operations
determined by applying the U.S. federal  statutory rate of 34% and the Company's
effective tax rate are summarized as follows:

     For federal  income tax purposes at June 30, 1995,  the Company has NOLs of
approximately  $6,012,000 which will expire in fiscal 2007 and 2010,  charitable
contribution carryovers of approximately $131,000 expiring 1998-2000, investment
credits of $34,472  expiring in 1998 and  minimum  tax  credits of $56,786  with
indefinite expirations. Certain changes in the Company's ownership may result in
a  limitation  on the  amount of net  operating  losses  ("NOLs")  that could be
utilized under Section 382 of the Internal  Revenue Code.  The Company  reviewed
Section 382 and has determined that no change in  control/ownership,  as defined
by Section 382, occurred as a result of the fiscal 1995  transactions  described
in Note N. If certain changes in the Company's ownership should occur subsequent
to June 30, 1995, there could be an annual limitation on the amount of NOLs that
could be utilized.

     A valuation allowance is provided when it is more likely than not that some
portion of the deferred tax amount will not be realized. The valuation allowance
of  $249,042  at July  1,  1993  was  reversed  during  fiscal  1994  due to the
substantial  increase in taxable  income and  management's  reassessment  of the
likelihood of realization of the deferred tax asset.

INCENTIVE COMPENSATION

     Effective  July 1, 1993,  the Company  implemented a team  performance  pay
program based on each employee's annual salary to recognize  monthly  completion
of departmental goals. Effective July 1, 1995 a portion of the team bonus became
payable  in  the  Company's   preferred  stock.  The  Company  also  implemented
semi-annual perfect attendance awards based on employee classification.


PROFIT SHARING PLAN

     In June  1983,  the  Company  adopted  a profit  sharing  plan in which all
qualified  employees who have completed one year of employment  with the Company
are included. Subject to Board action, the Company may contribute 15% of its net
income  before  taxes  during each  fiscal  year,  limited to 15% of  qualifying
salaries,  to a trust, the beneficiaries of which are the eligible  employees of
the Company. The Company's contribution to the trust is then apportioned to each
employee's  account  in the trust in an amount  equal to the  percentage  of the
total basic  compensation  paid to all eligible  employees which each employee's
individual basic compensation represents. An employee generally becomes eligible
to receive a  distribution  from the trust upon the  occurrence  of  retirement,
death,  total disability or termination.  Distributions of an employee's account
may be  made  either  in one  lump  sum or in  installments  over a  period  not
exceeding 15 years.  For the fiscal year ended June 30, 1995 the Company did not
contribute  to the  profit  sharing  plan.  There  have been no recent  material
changes to the plan.

401(K) PLAN

     The Company  adopted a 401(k)  Plan in October  1990 for the benefit of all
employees.  The Company will contribute 50 cents for every $1.00 of the first 4%
of an employee's pay deferment.  The Company will make contributions to employee
accounts at the end of each plan year if the employee is still  employed on that
date. New employees may enroll on any quarterly  entry date following six months
of  employment.  The Plan offers  thirteen  different  investment  options which
represent  different  levels of risk and  return.  Employees  have the option to
invest in one of eleven of the USF funds offered,  the Company's Preferred Stock
or the Bonnel Growth Fund.  For the fiscal year ended June 30, 1995, the Company
has accrued $48,000 for its 401(k) Plan matching contribution.

SAVINGS PLANS

     The Company has continued the program  started  during fiscal 1993 pursuant
to which it offers  senior  employees,  including  its  executive  officers,  an
opportunity to participate in savings programs utilizing USF, which was accepted
by  essentially  all  such  employees.  Limited  employee  contributions  to  an
Individual  Retirement  Account are matched by the Company.  Similarly,  if such
employees  contribute  monthly to the USF Tax Free Fund,  the Company will match
these  contributions  on a limited  basis.  Under each program,  if the employee
ceases  to  make  personal   contributions   or  withdraws   the  money,   their
participation  in the program is terminated and they may not  participate in the
future.

STOCK OPTION PLANS

     In March 1985,  the Board of Directors of the Company  adopted an Incentive
Stock Option Plan ("1985  Plan") which was approved by the  shareholders  of the
Company on April 2, 1985. Under the terms of the 1985 Plan,  certain  executives
and key  salaried  employees  of the Company and its  subsidiaries  were granted
options to purchase shares of the Company's  Preferred Stock. The maximum number
of shares of Preferred  Stock  authorized  for issuance  under the 1985 Plan was
200,000 shares  (subject to adjustment in the event of  reorganization,  merger,
consolidation,  liquidation,  recapitalization, or stock splits). Shares subject
to  purchase  pursuant  to an option  granted  under the 1985 Plan may be either
authorized but unissued shares or shares that were once issued and  subsequently
reacquired by the Company.

     The 1985 Plan was  amended on November  7, 1989 and  December  6, 1991.  In
December 1991 it was amended to provide  provisions to cause the Plan and future
grants  under the Plan to qualify  under 1934 Act Rule 16b-3.  The 1985 Plan was
administered  by a committee  consisting of the two outside members of the Board
of Directors of the Company. The 1985 Plan terminated on December 31, 1994.

     Options  granted  under the 1985 Plan were granted for a term of up to five
years in the case of  employees  who own in excess of 10% of the total  combined
voting power of all classes of the  Company's  stock and for up to ten years for
other employees.  The options were granted at an exercise price of not less than
100% of the fair market  value as of the date of the grant,  or 110% of the fair
market value in the case of any officer or employee  holding in excess of 10% of
the combined  voting power of the Company's  stock.  The  aggregate  fair market
value of the Preferred  Stock for which any employee was granted  options in any
calendar  year  could not exceed  $100,000  plus any  unused  carry-over  from a
preceding year.  During fiscal 1995 options  covering 42,500 shares were granted
at prices  ranging  from  $2.625 to $4.50 per  share.  All of the  options  were
granted at or above market price on the date of the grant. To date 79,000 option
grants have been  exercised  under the 1985 Plan;  and,  grants  covering  5,000
shares have expired.

     In November  1989 the Board of  Directors  adopted  the 1989  Non-Qualified
Stock Option Plan (the "1989  Plan") which  provides for the granting of options
to purchase shares of the Company's  Preferred Stock to directors,  officers and
employees  of the Company and its  subsidiaries.  On December 6, 1991,  the 1989
Plan was amended to provide provisions to cause the Plan and future grants under
the Plan to qualify under 1934 Act Rule 16b-3.  The 1989 Plan is administered by
a committee  consisting of two outside  members of the Board of  Directors.  The
maximum  number of shares of  Preferred  Stock  initially  approved for issuance
under the 1989 Plan is 800,000  shares.  During  the fiscal  year ended June 30,
1995 there were 7,000 shares  granted at exercise  prices ranging from $2.625 to
$3.375 per share.  All options were granted at or above market price on the date
of grant. To date,  252,500 options have been exercised under the 1989 Plan; and
4,700 options have expired.

     The Board of  Directors,  at a meeting held on July 14,  1992,  amended the
Stock Option Agreement for stock options granted during November 1989 to provide
for an option period of ten years. The amendment was accepted by all optionees.

     The following table shows, as to each of the officers of the Company listed
in the cash  compensation  table,  aggregated  option  exercises during the last
fiscal year and fiscal year-end option values.

COMPENSATION OF DIRECTORS

     The Company pays non-employee directors,  Messrs. Budden, Marleau,  Renaud,
Rubinstein  and  Terracina,  $500 per meeting and grants them options  under the
Company's  stock option  plans.  Their  compensation  is subject to a minimum of
$3,000 in any quarter. During the fiscal year ended June 30, 1995 Messrs. Budden
and Rubinstein each received cash  compensation of $12,000 and Messrs.  Marleau,
Renaud and Terracina each received cash compensation of $6,000. Mr. Terracina is
also a Director of ST&FC  where he received  cash  compensation  of $2,400.  Mr.
Renaud is also a Director of U.S. Advisors (Guernsey) Ltd. for which he received
no cash  compensation.  No stock  options were  granted  during the fiscal year.
Directors are reimbursed for reasonable  travel  expenses  incurred in attending
the meetings held by the Board of Directors.

REPORT ON EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION

     Effective  February  1995  the  Executive  Compensation  Committee  of  the
Registrant's Board of Directors was comprised of Messrs.  Budden, Holmes, Renaud
and Rubinstein.

     The  Company's  program  regarding  compensation  of executive  officers is
different from most public  corporations'  programs due to the  concentration of
control in one individual.  When Mr. Holmes' compensation is reviewed by Messrs.
Budden, Renaud and Rubinstein, Mr. Holmes is not present nor does he participate
in the final  decision.  The  Compensation  Committee did not meet during fiscal
year 1995. Mr. Holmes, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of the Company, owns
68.3% of the Company's Common Stock. He informs the Board of Directors as to the
amount of his proposed  remuneration  and that of the Company's  other executive
officers. Mr. Holmes recognizes that Registrant is a small business and believes
that an acceptable base compensation  should reflect an amount  competitive with
industry  peers taking into account the relative  cost of living in San Antonio,
Texas.  The base pay of the executives is relatively fixed but the executive has
the opportunity to increase  his/her  compensation by (1)  participating in team
building  programs  in order to  enhance  operational  and  fiscal  efficiencies
throughout  the  Company  with a percent  of  resulting  savings  flowing to the
executive;  and (2)  participating  directly in retirement and savings  programs
whereby  the  Company  will  contribute  amounts  relative  to  the  executive's
contribution.

     The Company utilizes option grants under the 1985 Plan and the 1989 Plan to

ITEM 13. CERTAIN RELATIONSHIPS AND RELATED TRANSACTIONS.

     Registrant  is  invested  in  several  of  the  Funds.  (See  Note O of the
Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this Form 10-K).

     During July 1994 the Company issued a $6 million subordinated  debenture to
ML. The proceeds  were utilized in  connection  with the Company's  purchases of
adjustable rate government  securities.  The debenture is collateralized only by
said government  securities.  See Note M to the Company's Consolidated Financial
Statement under Item 8 of this Form 10-K. Principal of the note in the amount of
approximately  $1.5 million was repaid to ML during June 1995,  thereby reducing
the balance under the debenture.

     Also,  during July 1994, ML and the Company agreed to be joint venturers in
connection with managing mutual funds in Canada. United Services Advisors Wealth
Management Inc. was formed in February 1995 and United Services Fund Management,
Inc. was formed in September 1995 in furtherance of the joint venture.  See Note
H to the Company's  Consolidated  Financial  Statement under Item 8 of this Form
10-K.

     On December 7, 1994,  the Company and ML entered into an agreement  whereby
the  Company  issued to ML one  million  shares  of a new  class of  convertible
non-voting  common  stock (Class B) at $5.00 per share and a warrant to purchase
an  additional  one  million  shares  of  capital  stock at $6.00  per  share in
consideration  of an  investment  of US $5  million.  The  market  price for the
Company's  preferred stock on December 7, 1994 was $3.25 per share.  (See Item 7
this Form 10-K for further detail.)

     In connection with ML's  investment in the Company,  the Company's Board of
Directors was expanded from five to nine, including two ML representatives; and,
Mr.  Holmes has been  elected to ML's Board of  Directors.  Hubert  Marleau  and
Richard Renaud,  an independent  outside director for ML, was appointed as an ML
representative  on the Company's  Board.  Mr.  Holmes  serves on the  Management
Committee,  and Mr.  Renaud  serves on the  Executive,  Audit  and  Compensation
Committees of ML. Mr. Holmes,  Hubert Marleau and Richard  Renaud,  as directors
and shareholders of ML, stand to benefit from the loan agreement reached in July
1994.

     Pursuant to the Shareholder's Agreement dated December 7, 1994, the Class B
stock will be convertible  into either one million shares of voting stock (Class
A) or one million shares of the Company's  existing  preferred stock if and when
mutual  fund  shareholder  and/or  USAI  preferred   shareholder  approvals  are
obtained. As part of the transaction,  Mr. Frank Holmes, Chairman and CEO of the
Company,  exchanged  72,720  shares of the  Company's  Class A common  stock for
164,347 shares of ML common stock. In addition,  subject to certain  conditions,
including obtaining mutual fund shareholder  approvals in the future, Mr. Holmes
will exchange an additional  177,280 Class A shares for 400,653 shares of ML. ML
may,  if it  converts  its Class B shares to Class A shares  after  mutual  fund
shareholder  approval,  own more than 50% of the issued and  outstanding  voting
shares of the Company.  Mr. Holmes would then own  approximately 3% of the total
outstanding  common  shares  of  ML.  Failing  approvals,  ML  may  opt,  during
prescribed  periods in 1996 and 1997,  to convert  its  investment  into a US $5
million debenture payable by the Company over a two year period from the date of
ML's conversion.

     The warrant  will allow ML, at its option,  to purchase  either one million
shares of Class A common stock or,  subject to preferred  stockholder  approval,
one million shares of the Company's existing preferred stock at a price of $6.00
per share  during  the six month  period  between  October 1, 1997 and March 31,
1998. In addition, an existing US $6 million debenture of the Company held by ML
was amended so as to be convertible at the option of ML into existing  preferred
shares  of the  Company  at a price of  $7.00  per  share if and when  preferred
shareholder approval is obtained.

     Pursuant to the  Shareholders'  Agreement dated December 7, 1995, among the
Company, Frank E. Holmes, F.E. Holmes Organization Inc., and ML, both Mr. Holmes
(individually  and for his holding company) and ML agree not to sell or transfer
in any manner any of the shares  either  party  owns  directly  or  beneficially
without obtaining the prior written consent of the other party. In the event one
party  receives an offer from a third party to purchase  any of its shares,  the
other party has thirty (30) days to either  purchase the  securities  subject to
the offer at the same  price and under the same  terms or to join with the other
party to sell all but not less than all of its shares to the third  party  under
the same terms and conditions in the offer.

     Additionally,  in the event of the death or disability of Mr. Holmes,  then
each of Mr. Holmes and F. E. Holmes  Organization  Inc.  shall be deemed to have
made an offer to sell the shares  owned by both  persons to the  Company and the
Company  will buy such shares.  Furthermore,  if a change of control in Marleau,
Lemire Inc. occurs after it has voting control of the Company, the Company shall
be deemed to have made an offer to  purchase  the shares,  options and  warrants
owned by Mr. Holmes and F. E. Holmes Organization Inc. which offer expires after
30 days if not  accepted.  This  agreement  replaces the  agreement  between the
Company and Mrs. Sorcha Holmes dated January 5, 1993.

     In  addition,  the  agreements  provided,  among other  things,  for by-law
amendments  providing for ML representation  on Board committees,  an employment
agreement  for Mr.  Holmes,  and  registration  rights  so that  certain  shares
acquired by ML may be sold in public offerings.

     Additionally,  in the event of termination of Mr. Holmes'  employment  with
the Company for any reason other than death,  incapacity,  termination for cause
or  non-renewal  of  the  term  of the  agreement  at Mr.  Holmes'  option,  the
employment  agreement  provides for the Company to pay Mr. Holmes within 30 days
of such termination an amount equal to two times all manner of compensation paid
or payable to Mr.  Holmes  during the last fiscal year,  adjusted to reflect any
increase in compensation granted to Mr. Holmes subsequent to the previous fiscal
year.  Currently Mr. Holmes receives a yearly salary of $303,835 with additional
remuneration of quarterly Trustee fees of $4,000 and per meeting fees of $2,000.
The  agreement  contains a  non-compete  clause  applicable  to Mr. Holmes for a
period of one year from the date of termination  of  employment.  The employment
agreement expires on October 31, 1997 and can be renewed for successive one-year
terms  unless a party  gives  notice of at least 120 days  before the end of the
then current term. This agreement replaces the agreement between the Company and
Mrs. Sorcha Holmes dated January 5, 1993.

     During the fiscal  year,  the  Company,  using ML as its broker,  purchased
35,119  (after 1 for 3 reverse  stock split)  shares of ML stock at an aggregate
price of  $181,778,  which at June 30, 1995 had an  approximate  market value of
$150,000.  The Company's consolidated ownership in ML is less than one (1)%. The
Company also engaged in Eurodollar  transactions  at a cost of $165,375  through
Marleau,  Lemire Inc. In addition,  the Company purchased other securities at an
aggregate price of $409,811 through Marleau, Lemire Inc.

     Eugene  McBurney  served as a director of the Registrant  from December 22,
1994 to July  10,  1995.  During  the  fiscal  year,  the  Registrant  purchased
securities  valued at $110,685  in a  transaction  in which the firm  Griffiths,
McBurney & Partners, of which Mr. McBurney is a principal,  acted as the issuers
agent.

     Mr.  Renaud  became a director  of the  Company in  December  1994.  At the
beginning  of the fiscal year a $100,000  loan,  memorialized  by a May 27, 1993
Loan Agreement between USAI and Hornchurch  Investments Limited was outstanding.
Loan proceeds  were used by Hornchurch to purchase a debenture  issued by Weider
Europe  B.V.,  an entity in which Mr.  Renaud  had a material  interest.  During
November  1994 the loan was  repaid to USAI  along  with  interest  due and USAI
recognized  approximately  $80,000 in income as a result of receiving a pro rata
participation in the equity appreciation of the Hornchurch/Weider transaction.

               matters on which the shares can vote, and the contingencies which

                    periods  shall have been  declared or shall then be declared
                    at the same time upon all Preferred Stock then  outstanding;
                    of (b(  unless  a  dividend  for the  same  period  shall be
                    declared  at the same time  upon all  Preferred  Stock  then
                    outstanding  in like  proportion  to the dividend  rate then
                    declared.

          "(C) LIQUIDATION PREFERENCE. In event of dissolution,  liquidation, or
               winding up of the corporation (whether voluntary or involuntary),

               distribution  to the  holders  of  shares  of any class of Common
               Stock,  the  holders  of each  Series  of  Preferred  Stock  then
               outstanding  shall be entitled to receive the amount fixed by the
               Board of Directors  (pursuant to paragraph  2.1 above) plus a sum
               equal to all  cumulated  but  unpaid  dividends  (whether  or not
               earned or  declared) to the date fixed for  distribution,  and no
               more. All remaining  assets shall be  distributed  pro rata among
               the  holders  of the  shares of Class A Common  Stock and Class B
               Common Stock.  If the assets  distributable  among the holders of
               Preferred Stock are  insufficient to permit full payment to them,
               the entire assets shall be  distributed  among the holders of the
               Preferred  Stock in  proportion to their  respective  liquidation
               preferences.  None  of the  following  events  is a  dissolution,
               liquidation,  or winding up within the meaning of this paragraph:

               any  other   corporation   or   corporations,   sale  of  all  or
               substantially all the assets of the corporation,  or any purchase
               or  redemption  by the  corporation  of  any  of its  outstanding
               shares.

          "(D) REDEMPTION.

               "(1) RIGHT;  METHOD. All or any part of any one or more Series of
                    Preferred  Stock may be redeemed at any time or times at the
                    option of the  corporation,  by  resolution  of the Board of
                    Directors,  in accordance  with the terms and  conditions of
                    this  Article Four and those fixed by the Board of Directors
                    (pursuant  to  paragraph  2.1 above).  The  corporation  may
                    redeem  shares of any one or more Series  without  redeeming
                    shares of any other  Series.  If less than all the shares of
                    any Series are to be  redeemed,  the shares of the Series to
                    be redeemed  shall be selected  ratably or any lot or by any
                    other equitable method determined by the Board of Directors.

               "(2) NOTICE. Notice shall be given to the holders of shares to be
                    redeemed, either personally or by mail, not less than twenty
                    (20) nor more than fifty (50) days before the date fixed for
                    redemption.

               "(3) PAYMENT.  Redeemed  shares shall be paid in cash, the amount
                    fixed by the Board of Directors  (pursuant to paragraph  2.1
                    above) plus a sum equal to all cumulated by unpaid dividends
                    (whether  or not earned or  declared)  to the date fixed for
                    redemption, and no more.

               "(4) PROVISION  FOR  PAYMENT.  On or  before  the date  fixed for
                    redemption, the corporation may provide for payment of a sum
                    sufficient to redeem the shares called for redemption either
                    (i) by setting aside the sum, separate from its other funds,
                    in trust for the  benefit of the holders of the shares to be
                    redeemed,  or (ii) by depositing such sum in a bank or trust
                    company  (either one in Texas having  capital and surplus of
                    at least Ten Million Dollars [$10,000,000]  according to its
                    latest statement of condition, or one anywhere in the United
                    States duly  appointed  and acting as transfer  agent of the
                    corporation) as a trust fund, with irrevocable  instructions
                    and  authority  to the  bank  or  trust  company  to give of
                    complete  the notice of  redemption  and to pay, on or after
                    the date  fixed  for  redemption,  the  redemption  price on
                    surrender  of  their  respective  share  certificates.   The
                    holders  may  be  evidenced  by  a  list  certified  by  the
                    corporation (by its president or a vice president and by its
                    secretary  or an  assistant  secretary)  or by its  transfer
                    agent. If the corporation so provides for payment, then from
                    and after  the date  fixed for  redemption:  (a) the  shares
                    shall be deemed to be redeemed,  (b) dividends thereon shall
                    cease to accrue,  (C)such  setting aside or deposit shall be
                    deemed to  constitute  full payment for the shares,  (d) the
                    shares shall no longer be deemed to be outstanding,  (e) the
                    holders thereof shall cease to be shareholders  with respect
                    to such  shares,  and (f) the  holders  shall have no rights
                    with respect  thereto  except the right to receive  (without
                    interest)  their  proportionate  shares  of the funds so set
                    aside  or  deposited  upon  surrender  of  their  respective
                    certificates, and any right to convert such shares which may
                    exist.  Any  interest  accrued  on  funds  so set  aside  or
                    deposited shall belong to the corporation. If the holders of
                    the shares do not,  within six (6) years after such deposit,
                    claim any amount so deposited for  redemption  thereof,  the
                    bank or trust  company  shall  upon  demand  pay over to the
                    corporation  the balance of the funds so deposited,  and the
                    bank or trust  company  shall  thereupon  be relieved of all
                    responsibility to such holders.

               "(5) STATUS OF REDEEMED  SHARES.  Shares of Preferred Stock which
                    are redeemed  shall be canceled and shall be restored to the
                    status of authorized but unissued shares.

          "(E) PURCHASE. Except as specified in paragraph 2.2B(3) nothing herein
               shall limit the right of the  corporation  to purchase any of its
               outstanding  shares of Preferred Stock in accordance with law, by
               public or private transaction.  

          "(F")VOTING.  Except as fixed by the Board of  Directors  (pursuant to
               paragraph 2.1 above), and except as otherwise  expressly provided
               by law,  all voting power shall be in the Class A Common Stock as
               provided for in paragraph  3.2A below,  and none in the Preferred
               Stock.  Where  Preferred  Stock as a class has voting power,  all

                          ARTICLES OF AMENDMENT TO THE
                       RESTATED ARTICLES OF INCORPORATION
                                       OF
                         UNITED SERVICES ADVISORS, INC.

     Pursuant to the  provisions  of the Texas  Business  Corporation  Act,  the
undersigned Corporation hereby adopts the following Articles of Amendment to its
Restated Articles of Incorporation.

                                    ARTICLE I

     The name of the Corporation is United Services Advisors, Inc.

                                   ARTICLE II

     The following  amendments to the Restated  Articles of  Incorporation  were
adopted by the shareholders of the Corporation on the 2nd day of April, 1985.

     The amendments delete the provisions of Article Four and add new paragraphs
in substitution  therefor,  which provide that each outstanding share of Class A
Common Stock,  par value $0.05 per share,  shall be converted  into one share of
Common Stock, par value $0.05 per share,  provide for the authorization of a new
class of  Preferred  Stock and  delete  authorization  for the  Company to issue
shares of Class A Common Stock, Class B Common Stock and Series Preferred Stock.
The Restated Articles of Incorporation are hereby amended as follows:

     Articles Four of the Restated  Articles of  Incorporation is hereby amended
by deleting said Article Four in its entirety and by  substituting a new Article
Four as follows:

                                  "ARTICLE FOUR

"1. GENERAL. The corporation is authorized to issue one class of Preferred Stock
("Preferred  Stock"),  and one class of Common Stock ("Common Stock"). The total
number of shares which the  corporation  is  authorized  to issue is  10,000,000
shares.  The number of shares of Preferred Stock authorized is 6,000,000 and the
par value of each  such  share if $0.05.  The  number of shares of Common  Stock
authorized is 4,000,000, and the par value of each such share is $0.05.

"2. PREFERRED STOCK.

     "2.1 VOTING  RIGHTS.  Except as  otherwise  expressly  provided by law, all
voting  rights shall be in the Common  Stock as provided  for in  paragraph  3.1
below, and none in the Preferred Stock.

"2.2 DIVIDENDS.

     "(1)  AMOUNT;  PARTICIPATING.  In any fiscal year of the  corporation,  the
holders of the  Preferred  Stock at the time  outstanding  shall be  entitled to
receive, when and as declared by the Board of Directors of the corporation,  out
of any funds legally  available  therefor,  noncumulative  cash  dividends in an
aggregate  amount up to 5% of the  corporation's  after-tax net earnings for its
prior fiscal year. In any fiscal year of the  corporation,  until the holders of
the Preferred  Stock shall have received cash  dividends  aggregating  5% of the
corporation's  after-tax  net  earnings  for  its  prior  fiscal  year,  no cash
dividends  shall be paid to the holders of the Common Stock.  In any fiscal year
of the  corporation  in which the  holders  of the  Preferred  Stock  shall have
received  cash  dividends  aggregating  5% of the  corporation's  after-tax  net
earnings for its prior  fiscal year,  the holders of the Common Stock shall then
be entitled to receive,  when and as declared by the Board of Directors,  out of
any funds legally available therefor,  cash dividends per share up to the amount
of cash dividends per share  theretofore  received during such fiscal adjustment
as provided in paragraph  2.2(4) hereof.  In any fiscal year of the corporation,
when the cash dividends per share paid to the holders of the Common Stock during
such fiscal year shall be the maximum amount permitted pursuant to the preceding
sentence,  such cash  dividends,  if any, as the Board of Directors may elect to
pay during the balance of such fiscal year,  out of any funds legally  available
therefor,  shall be paid  simultaneously  on both the  Preferred  Stock  and the
Common Stock in the same  proportionate  amounts per share as  theretofore  paid
during the fiscal year on the Preferred Stock and the Common Stock.

     "(2) NONCUMULATIVE. Dividends on Preferred Stock shall be noncumulative and
no rights shall accrue to the holders of Preferred  Stock in the event that,  in
any fiscal year, the corporation shall fail to declare or pay dividends of up to
5% of the after-tax net earnings of the  corporation  for its prior fiscal year,
whether or not the  earnings of the  corporation  for the prior fiscal year were
sufficient to pay such dividend in whole or in part.

     "(3) NET EARNINGS AFTER TAXES. Net earnings after taxes for any fiscal year
shall be the amount shown as after-tax net earnings in the corporation's audited
statement of operations or audited consolidated  statement of operations for the
fiscal year, as the case may be. Such audited statement of operations or audited
consolidated  statement  of  operations  shall be  prepared in  accordance  with
generally  accepted  accounting  principles.  The amount shown as after-tax  net
earnings  in  the  audited  statement  of  operations  or  audited  consolidated
statement of operation  shall be final and binding upon the holders of Preferred
Stock.

     "(4) DIVIDEND DILUTION  PROTECTION.  In the event of any stock split, stock
dividend or other stock subdivision or stock combination,  of or with respect to
the Common Stock of the corporation (each of the foregoing  hereinafter referred
to as an "Event") but not including shares of Common Stock issued in a merger or
other business combination, then the maximum cash dividends per share payable to
the  holders  of shares of  Common  Stock  pursuant  to the  third  sentence  of
paragraph  2.2(1)  hereof shall be adjusted by  multiplying  each such per share
cash dividend amount by a fraction whose numerator shall be the number of shares
of  Common  Stock  outstanding   immediately  prior  to  such  Event  and  whose
denominator   shall  be  the  number  of  shares  of  Common  Stock  outstanding
immediately  following such Event.  Such adjustment shall be made at the time of
each occurrence of an Event, giving effect to all prior adjustments.  Holders of
shares of  Preferred  Stock shall be entitled to notice of any Event  within ten
(10) business days of its occurrence.

     "2.3 PURCHASE.  Nothing herein shall limit the right of the  corporation to
purchase any of its  outstanding  shares of Preferred  Stock in accordance  with
law, by public or private transaction.

     "2.4 CONVERSION  RIGHTS. The shares of Preferred Stock shall be convertible
into the shares of any other class of stock of the corporation.

     "2.5 LIQUIDATION PREFERENCE OVER COMMON STOCK. In the event of dissolution,
liquidation or winding up of the corporation (whether voluntary or involuntary),
after payment or provision for payment of debts but before any  distribution  to
the holders of shares of Common  Stock,  the holders of the shares of  Preferred
Stock shall be entitled to receive $0.05 per share.  Holders of shares of Common
Stock shall then be entitled to receive $0.05 per share. All remaining assets of
the corporation upon liquidation shall be distributed pro rata among the holders
of the shares of Preferred Stock and Common Stock.  If the assets  distributable
among the holders of Preferred  Stock as  insufficient to permit full payment to
them of $0.05 per share,  the entire assets of corporation  shall be distributed
prorata among the holders of the Preferred  Stock.  None of the following events
is a  dissolution,  liquidation  or  winding  up  within  the  meaning  of  this
paragraph: consolidation,  merger, or reorganization of the corporation with any
other  corporation or corporations,  sale of all or substantially all the assets
of the  corporation,  or any purchase or redemption by the corporation of any of
its outstanding shares.

"3. COMMON STOCK.

     "3.1 VOTING  RIGHTS.  The holders of shares of Common Stock shall have full
voting  rights at any  annual or  special  meeting  of the  shareholders  and as
provided for in the Texas Business Corporation Act.

     "3.2 DIVIDENDS. No cash dividends shall be declared or paid on Common Stock
in any fiscal  year  unless  cash  dividends  paid  during  such  fiscal year on
outstanding  Preferred  Stock  shall  equal  at least  5% of the  after-tax  net
earnings of the corporation for its prior fiscal year.

     "3.3 PURCHASE. No Common Stock shall be purchased by the corporation in any
fiscal year unless cash  dividends  shall have been paid during such fiscal year
on outstanding Preferred Stock in the amount of at least 5% of the after-tax net
earnings of the corporation for its prior fiscal year. Except as provided in the
foregoing  sentence,  nothing herein shall limit the right of the corporation to
purchase any of its  outstanding  shares of Common Stock in accordance with law,
by public or private transaction.

"4.  DENIAL  OF  PREEMPTIVE  RIGHTS.  No  holder  of  shares of any class of the
corporation, Preferred Stock or Common Stock, shall have any preemptive right to
subscribe for or acquire additional shares of the corporation of the same or any
other class, whether such shares shall be hereby or hereafter authorized; and no
holder of shares of any class of the corporation shall have any right to acquire
any  shares  which  may be held in the  treasury  of the  corporation.  All such
additional or treasury shares may be sold for such consideration,  at such time,
and to such  person or persons as the Board of  Directors  may from time to time
determine."

"5. CLASS A COMMON STOCK INTO COMMON STOCK.  Each  outstanding  share of Class A
Common Stock, par value $0.05 per share, shall become one share of Common Stock,
par value $0.05 per share, effective upon the issuance by the Secretary of State
of the State of Texas of the  Certificate of Amendment to the Restated  Articles
of Incorporation wherein this Article Four becomes part of the Restated Articles
of Incorporation, as amended, of the corporation.

                                   ARTICLE III

Articles of Incorporation has been effected in conformity with the provisions of

     The  number  of shares  entitled  to vote on the  amendments  made by these
Articles  of  Amendment  to the  Restated  Articles of  Incorporation,  the same
constituting  all of the outstandingm  shares of the Corporation,  was 2,159,516
shares of Class C Common  Stock.  The  number of shares of Class A Common  Stock
which voted for such amendment was 2,640,744,  and the number of shares of Class
A Common Stock which voted against such amendment was 296.

                                    ARTICLE V

     Any exchange,  reclassification  or  cancellation of issued shares provided
for in the amendments shall be effected in the following manner:

     Each  outstanding  share of Class A Common Stock, of par value of $0.05 per
     share,  shall be come one (1) share of Common  Stock,  par value  $0.05 per
     share,  effective  upon the issuance by the Secretary of State of the State
     of Texas of the  Certificate  of  Amendment  to the  Restated  Articles  of

changes  provide  for  a  reclassification   of  the  existing   authorized  and

     "3.5  CONVOCATION OF MEETING OF SHARES OF THE  CORPORATION.  The holders of
shares of Class B Common  Stock shall have the right to require the  Corporation
from its 1995 fiscal year to its 1997 fiscal year (exclusively), to validly call
and hold  meetings  of the  holders of each class of stock in the capital of the
Corporation,  at least once during each such fiscal year until the  consents and
approvals  of such  holders  have been  obtained  so that there shall exist such
number of authorized  shares of Preferred  Stock as is equal to the aggregate of
(i) the issued and  outstanding  shares of  Preferred  Stock at the time of such
consents and approvals  and (ii) the number of shares of Preferred  Stock as may
be issuable pursuant to any outstanding subscriptions, calls, options, warrants,

Restated  Articles of  incorporation  wherein  these  Provisions of Article Four

                               ADVISORY AGREEMENT

     AGREEMENT  made  as of the  21st  day of  September,  1994  between  UNITED

Texas and having its  principal  place of  business in San  Antonio,  Texas (the

principal place of business in San Antonio, Texas (the "Trust").

     WHEREAS,  the  Trust is  engaged  in  business  as an  open-end  management
investment  company and is registered  under the Investment  Company Act of 1940
(the "1940 Act"); and

     WHEREAS,  the Advisor is engaged  principally  in the business of rendering
investment  management  services and is registered under the Investment Advisors
Act of 1940; and

     WHEREAS,  the Trust  intends to initially  offer  shares in SIF  Government
Money Fund and SIF Government Short-Term Fund [such series (the "Initial Funds")
together  with all other  series  subsequently  established  by the  Trust  with
respect to which the Trust  desires to retain the  Advisor to render  investment
advisory  services  hereunder  the  Advisor is  willing  so to do  (collectively
referred to as the "Funds")];

     NOW,  THEREFORE,  in consideration of the mutual covenants herein contained
and  other  good and  valuable  consideration,  the  receipt  whereof  is hereby
acknowledged, the parties hereto agree as follows:

     1.   APPOINTMENT OF ADVISOR.

          (a)  Initial  Funds.  The Trust hereby  appoints the Advisor to act as
               Advisor and  investment  advisor to each of the Initial Funds for
               the period and on the terms herein set forth. The Advisor accepts
               such  appointment  and agrees to render the  services  herein set
               forth, for the compensation herein provided.

          (b)  Additional  Funds. In the event that the Trust establishes one or
               more series of shares  other than the Initial  Funds with respect
               to which it desires to retain  the  Advisor to render  management
               and investment  advisory services  hereunder,  it shall so notify
               the Advisor in writing, indicating the advisory fee which will be
               payable with respect to the additional  series of shares.  If the
               Advisor is willing to render  such  services,  it shall so notify
               the Trust in  writing,  whereupon  such  series  of shares  shall
               become a Fund hereunder.

     2.   DUTIES OF ADVISOR.

          The Advisor, at its own expense,  shall furnish the following services
          and facilities to the Trust:

               Trust)  what  investments  shall  be  purchased,   held  sold  or
               exchanged by each Fund and what portion, if any, of the assets of
               each Fund shall be held  uninvested,  and (iii)  make  changes on
               behalf of the Trust in the  investments of each Fund. The Advisor
               will also  manage,  supervise  and conduct the other  affairs and
               business of the Trust of each Fund thereof and matters incidental
               thereto,  subject  always to the control of the Board of Trustees
               of the Trust and to the  provisions of the  Declaration  of Trust
               and By-laws and the 1940 Act.

          (b)  Office Space and Facilities.  The Advisor shall furnish the Trust
               office  space in the  offices  of the  Advisor,  or in such other
               place or places as may be agreed upon from time to time,  and all
               necessary office facilities, simple business equipment, supplies,
               utilities,  and  telephone  service for  managing the affairs and
               investments  of the Trust.  These  services are  exclusive of the
               necessary services and records of any dividend  disbursing agent,
               transfer  agent,  registrar  or  custodian,  and  accounting  and
               bookkeeping  services to provided by the Trust's  transfer agent,
               record keeping service or custodian.

          (c)  Personnel.  The Advisor shall provide all necessary executive and
               clerical  personnel for  administering  the affairs of the Trust,
               and shall compensate all personnel,  officers and Trustees of the
               Trust if such  persons are also  employees  of the Advisor or its
               affiliates, except as provided in Paragraph 3(f) hereof.

          (d)  Distribution Expenses.  Except as may be provided in distribution
               expense plans as  contemplated  by Rule 12b-1 under the 1940 Act,
               the  Advisor  shall bear all sales,  promotions  or  distribution
               expenses in  connection  with the  distribution  of shares of any
               Fund and shall be the sole judge of the extent to which  sales or
               promotion expenses shall be incurred;  provided however, that the
               Advisor shall not be obligated to pay for any portion of the cost
               of prospectuses  or periodic  reports  provided to  shareholders.
               Expenses  incurred in complying with laws regulating the issue or
               sale of securities shall not be deemed to be sales,  promotion or
               distribution expenses.

          (e)  Portfolio  Transactions.  The Advisor  shall place all orders for
               the purchase and sale of portfolio  securities for the account of
               each  Fund with  brokers  or  dealers  selected  by the  Advisor,
               although the Trust will pay the actual  brokerage  commissions on
               portfolio  transactions  in accordance  with  Paragraph  3(c). In
               executing   portfolio   transactions  and  selecting  brokers  or
               dealers,  the Advisor will use its best efforts to seek on behalf
               of  the  Trust  or  any  Fund  thereof  the  best  overall  terms
               available.  In assessing the best overall terms available for any
               transaction,  the  Advisor  shall  consider  all factors it deems
               relevant,  including  the breadth of the market in the  security,
               the price of the security,  the financial condition and execution
               capability of the broker or dealer, and the reasonableness of the
               commission,  if  any  (for  the  specific  transaction  and  on a
               continuing   basis).   In  evaluating   the  best  overall  terms
               available,  and in  selecting  the  broker or dealer to execute a
               particular  transaction,   the  Advisor  may  also  consider  the
               brokerage  and  research  services (as those terms are defined in
               Section 28(e) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934) provided to
               any Fund  and/or  other  accounts  over  which the  Advisor or an
               affiliate of the Advisor  exercises  investment  discretion.  The
               Advisor is  authorized  to pay to a broker or dealer who provides
               such brokerage and research services a commission for executing a
               portfolio  transaction  for any fund  which is in  excess  of the
               amount of commission  another broker or dealer would have charged
               for  effecting  that  transaction  if, but only if,  the  Advisor
               determines in good faith that such  commission  was reasonable in
               relation  to the value of the  brokerage  and  research  services
               provided  by such  broker  or  dealer,  viewed  in  terms of that
               particular  transaction  or in terms of all of the accounts  over
               which  investment  discretion is so exercised.  

     3.   ALLOCATION OF EXPENSES.

          Except for the services and  facilities  to be provided by the Advisor
          as set forth in Paragraph 2 above, the Trust assumes and shall pay all
          expenses  for all other  Trust  operations  and  activities  and shall
          reimburse the Advisor for any such  expenses  incurred by the Advisor.

               reimbursement  of actual  expenses  incurred  by the  Advisor  in
               performing   such   functions   for  the  Trust,   and  including

          (a)  For the  services  and  facilities  to be provided to each of the
               Funds by the Advisor as provided in Paragraph 2 hereof, the Trust
               shall pay the Advisor a monthly  fee with  respect to each of the
               Funds as soon as  practical  after the last day of each  calendar
               month,  which fee shall be paid at the rate set forth below based
               upon the Monthly  Average Net Assets [as defined in  subparagraph
               (C) below] of such Fund for such calendar month:

                              ADVISORY FEE SCHEDULE
                                    Monthly

                   Bonnel Growth Fund             1/12 of 1.00%

          (b)  In the case of  termination of this Agreement with respect to any
               Fund during any calendar month, the fee with respect to such Fund
               for that month  shall be reduced  proportionately  based upon the
               number of calendar  days during which it is in effect and the fee
               shall be  computed  upon the  average net assets of such Fund for
               the business days which it is so in effect.

          (c)  The "Monthly Average Net Assets" of any Fund of the Trust for any
               calendar  month  shall  be  equal  to the  quotient  produced  by
               dividing  (i) the sum of the net assets of such Fund,  determined
               in accordance with procedures established from time to time by or
               under  the  direction  of the Board of  Trustees  of the Trust in
               accordance  with the Declaration of Trust of the Trust, as of the
               close of  business  on each day during  such month that such Fund
               was open for business, by (ii) the number of such days.

     5.   EXPENSE LIMITATION.

          The Advisor  agrees that for any fiscal year of the Trust during which
          the total of all expenses of the Trust (including  investment advisory
          fees under this agreement, but excluding interest, portfolio brokerage
          commissions and expenses,  taxes and extraordinary  items) exceeds the
          lowest expense  limitation  imposed in any state in which the Trust is
          then  making  sales of its  shares  or in which  its  shares  are then
          qualified  for sale,  the Advisor  will  reimburse  the Trust for such
          expenses not otherwise excluded from reimbursement by this Paragraph 5
          to the extent  that they  exceed  such  expense  limitation.  

     6.   TRUST TRANSACTIONS.

          The  Advisor  agrees  that  neither  it nor  any of  its  officers  or
          Directors  will take any long or short term  position in the shares of
          the Trust; provided, however, that such prohibition:

          (a)  shall not prevent the Advisor from purchasing shares of the Trust
               if orders to purchase  such shares are placed upon the receipt by
               the  Advisor of  purchase  orders for such  shares and are not in
               excess of such purchase orders received by the Advisor; and

          (b)  shall not prevent  the  purchase of shares of the Trust by any of
               the persons above  described for their account and for investment
               at the price at which such shares are  available to the public at
               the time of  purchase  or as part of the  initial  capital of the
               Trust.

     7.   RELATIONS WITH TRUST.

          Subject to and in accordance with the Declaration of Trust and By-laws
          of the Trust and the  Articles  of  Incorporation  and  By-laws of the
          Advisor,  respectively,  it is  understood  that  Trustees,  officers,
          agents and  shareholders  of the Trust are or may be interested in the
          Advisor  (or  any  successor  thereof)  as  directors,   officers,  or
          otherwise;  that directors,  officers,  agents and shareholders of the
          Advisor are or may be interested  in the Trust as Trustees,  officers,
          shareholders,  or otherwise;  that the Advisor (or any such successor)
          is or may be interested  in the Trust as a  shareholder  or otherwise;
          and that the effect of any such adverse interests shall be governed by
          said Declaration of Trust, Articles of Incorporation and By-laws.

     8.   LIABILITY OF ADVISOR AND OFFICERS AND TRUSTEES OF THE TRUST.

          No provision of this Agreement  shall be deemed to protect the Advisor
          against any  liability  to the Trust or its  shareholders  to which it
          might otherwise be subject by reason of any willful  misfeasance,  bad
          faith or gross  negligence  in the  performance  of its  duties or the
          reckless disregard of its obligations and duties under this Agreement.
          Nor shall any  provision  hereof be deemed to protect  any  Trustee or
          officer  of the Trust  against  any such  liability  to which he might
          otherwise be subject by reason of any willful  misfeasance,  bad faith
          or gross  negligence in the  performance of his duties or the reckless
          disregard  of his  obligations  and duties.  If any  provision of this
          Agreement shall be held or made invalid by a court decision,  statute,
          rule or  otherwise,  the  remainder  of this  Agreement  shall  not be
          affected thereby.

          thereby.

     11.  LIMITATION OF LIABILITY.

          (a)  THE  TRUST.  The term  "Accolade  Funds"  means and refers to the
               Trustees  from  time to  time  serving  under  the  Master  Trust
               Agreement  of the Trust  dated  April 15,  1993,  as the same may
               subsequently   thereto  have  been,  or  subsequently  hereto  be
               amended. It is expressly agreed that the obligations of the Trust
               hereunder  shall  not  be  binding  upon  any  of  the  Trustees,
               shareholders,  nominees,  officers,  agents or  employees  of the
               Trust,  personally,  but bind only the assets and property of the
               Trust,  as provided in the Master  Trust  Agreement of the Trust.
               The execution and delivery of this Agreement have been authorized
               by the  Trustees and  shareholders  of the Trust and signed by an
               authorized officer of the Trust, acting as such, and neither such
               authorization   by  such  Trustees  and   shareholders  nor  such
               execution  and delivery by such  officer  shall be deemed to have
               been made by any of them  individually or to impose any liability
               on any of them  personally,  but shall  bind only the  assets and
               property of the Trust as provided in its Master Trust Agreement.

          (b)  THE  ADVISOR.  It is expressly  agreed that the  oblations of the
               Advisor   hereunder   shall  not  be  binding  upon  any  of  the
               shareholders,  nominees,  officers,  agents or  employees  of the
               Advisor, personally, but bind only the assets and property of the
               Advisor,   respectively.   The  execution  and  delivery  of  the
               Agreement  have been  authorized by the directors and officers of
               the Advisor and signed by an  authorized  officer of the Advisor,
               acting as such, and neither such  authorization by such directors
               and  officers  nor such  execution  and  delivery by such officer
               shall be deemed to have been made by any of them  individually or
               to impose any liability on any of them personally, but shall bind
               only the assets and property of the Advisor,  respectively.  This
               limitation  of  liability  shall  not be deemed  to  protect  the
               shareholders,  nominees,  officers,  agents or  employees  of the
               Advisor against any liability to the Trust or its shareholders to
               which they might  otherwise  be subject by reason of any  willful
               misfeasance,  bad faith or gross negligence in the performance of
               their duties or the reckless  disregard of their  obligations and
               duties  under this  Agreement.  IN WITNESS  WHEREOF,  the parties
               hereto have caused this  Agreement  to be executed as of the date
               first set forth above.

                             SUB-ADVISERY AGREEMENT

SERVICES ADVISORS,  INC., a corporation organized under the laws of the State of
Texas (the "Adviser"), ACCOLADE FUNDS, a Massachusetts business trust having its
principal  place of business in San Antonio,  Texas (the "Trust"),  on behalf of
the  Bonnel  Growth  Fund (the  "Fund"),  a series of shares of the  Trust,  and
BONNEL, INC. (the "Sub-Adviser") of Reno, Nevada.

     WHEREAS,  the Adviser is engaged in the  business of  rendering  investment
management services to the Trust; and

     WHEREAS,  the Trust is an open-end management  investment company and is so
registered under the Investment Company Act of 1940 (the "1940 Act"); and

     WHEREAS,  the Trust is operated as a "series company" within the meaning of
Rule  18f-2  under  the 1940 Act and has  three  separate  series  of  shares of
beneficial interest, one of which series is the Fund.

     NOW,  THEREFORE,  WITNESSETH:  That it is hereby agreed between the parties
hereto as follows: 

     1. APPOINTMENT OF SUB-ADVISER.

          The  Sub-Adviser is hereby  appointed to provide  investment  advisory
          services to the Fund for the period and on the terms herein set forth.
          The  Sub-Adviser  accepts  such  appointment  and agrees to render the
          services herein set forth,  for the compensation  herein provided.  To
          enable  Sub-Adviser  to exercise fully its discretion and authority as
          provided in this Section 1, the Trust hereby  constitutes and appoints
          Sub-Adviser as the Trust's agent and attorney-in-fact  with full power
          and authority for the Trust and on the Trust's behalf to buy, sell and
          otherwise  deal in securities  and contracts  relating to same for the
          Fund.

     2. DUTIES OF SUB-ADVISER.

          (a)  The  Sub-Adviser  is hereby  authorized  and  directed and hereby
               agrees,  subject to the stated investment  objective and policies
               of the Fund as set forth in the  Fund's  Prospectus  (as  defined
               below) and  subject to the  supervision  of the  Adviser  and the
               Board of Trustees of the Trust,  (i) to  develop,  recommend  and
               implement  such  investment  program and strategy for the Fund as
               may  from  time  to  time  in  the   circumstances   appear  most
               appropriate to the achievement of the investment objective of the
               Fund as  stated  in the  aforesaid  Prospectus,  (ii) to  provide
               research  and  analysis  relative to the  investment  program and
               investments  of the  Fund,  (iii) to  determine  what  securities
               should be  purchased  and sold and what  portion of the assets of
               the Fund should be held in cash or cash  equivalents  and (iv) to
               monitor on a continuing  basis the  performance  of the portfolio
               securities of the Fund. The  Sub-Adviser  will advise the Trust's
               custodian  and the Adviser on a prompt basis of each purchase and
               sale of a portfolio  security  specifying the name of the issuer,
               the  description  and amount or number of shares of the  security
               purchased,  the market price,  commission and gross or net price,
               trade date,  settlement date and identity of the effecting broker
               or  dealer;  and will  review  the  accuracy  of the  pricing  of
               portfolio  securities in accordance with Trust  procedures.  From
               time to time,  as the  Trustees  of the Trust or the  Adviser may
               reasonably  request,  the Sub-Adviser will furnish to the Trust's
               officers  and  to  each  of its  Trustees  reports  on  portfolio
               transactions  and  reports  on issues of  securities  held in the
               portfolio,  all in such  detail as the Trust or the  Adviser  may
               reasonably request.  The Sub-Adviser will also inform the Trust's
               officers and Trustees on a current basis of changes in investment
               strategy or tactics.  The Sub-Adviser  will make its officers and
               employees  available  to  meet  with  the  Trust's  officers  and
               Trustees on due notice to review the  investments  and investment
               program  of the Fund in the  light  of  current  and  prospective
               economic and market conditions.

               The Sub-Adviser  shall place all orders for the purchase and sale
               of portfolio  securities for the account of the Fund with brokers
               or dealers selected by the  Sub-Adviser,  although the Trust will
               pay the actual brokerage  commissions and any transfer taxes with
               respect to transactions in the portfolio securities of the Trust.
               The   Sub-Adviser   is   authorized  to  submit  any  such  order
               collectively  with orders on behalf of other  accounts  under its
               management,  provided that the Sub-Adviser  shall have determined
               that such  action is in the best  interest  of the Fund and is in
               accordance with applicable law,  including,  without  limitation,
               Rule  17d-1   under  the  1940  Act.   In   executing   portfolio
               transactions and selecting  brokers or dealers,  the Sub- Adviser
               will use its best  efforts to seek on behalf of the Fund the best
               overall  terms  available.  In assessing  the best overall  terms
               available for any transaction, the Sub-Adviser shall consider all
               factors it deems relevant, including the breadth of the market in
               the security,  the price of the security, the financial condition
               and  execution  capability  of the  broker  or  dealer,  and  the
               reasonableness  of the  commission,  if  any  (for  the  specific
               transaction  and on a continuing  basis).  In evaluating the best
               overall terms available, and in selecting the broker or dealer to
               execute  a  particular  transaction,  the  Sub-Adviser  may  also
               consider  the  brokerage  and  research  services (as those terms
               defined in Section 28(e) of the Securities  Exchange Act of 1934)
               provided  to the  Fund  and/or  other  accounts  over  which  the
               Sub-Adviser  or  an  affiliate  of  the   Sub-Adviser   exercises
               investment discretion.  The Sub-Adviser is authorized to pay to a
               broker  or  dealer  who  provides  such  brokerage  and  research
               services a commission for executing a portfolio  transaction  for
               the Fund which is in excess of the amount of  commission  another
               broker  or  dealer   would  have  charged  for   effecting   that
               transaction if, but only if, the  Sub-Adviser  determines in good
               faith that such  commission  was  reasonable  in  relation to the
               value of the  brokerage  and research  services  provided by such
               broker or dealer, viewed in terms of that particular  transaction
               or in  terms  of  all  of  the  accounts  over  which  investment
               discretion  is  so  exercised.   An  affiliated   person  of  the
               Sub-Adviser may provide  brokerage  services to the Fund provided
               that the  Sub-Adviser  shall have  determined that such action is
               consistent  with its  obligation  to seek the best overall  terms
               available and is in accordance with  applicable  law,  including,
               without limitation,  Section 17(e) of the 1940 Act. The foregoing
               shall not be  deemed to  authorize  an  affiliated  person of the
               Sub-Adviser  to  enter  into   transactions   with  the  Fund  as
               principal.

               In the  performance of its duties  hereunder,  the Sub-Adviser is
               and  shall be an  independent  contractor  and  unless  otherwise
               expressly  provided or authorized  shall have no authority to act
               for or  represent  the Trust in any way or otherwise be deemed to
               be an agent of the Trust or of the Adviser.

          (b)  Delivery of  Documents.  The Adviser will furnish upon request or
               has  furnished  the Sub-  Adviser with true copies of each of the

               Agreement,  as  presently  in effect and as it shall from time to

               (ii) The Trust's By-Laws and amendments thereto (such By-Laws, as
               presently in effect and as it shall from time to time be amended,

               (iii)Resolutions of the Trust's Board of Trustees authorizing the

               Advisory Agreement and this Agreement;

               (iv) The most  recent  Post-Effective  Amendment  to the  Trust's
               Registration  Statement on Form N-1A under the  Securities Act of
               1933 as amended  ("1933  Act") and the 1940 Act as filed with the
               Securities and Exchange Commission;

               (v) The  Fund's  most  recent  prospectus  (such  prospectus,  as
               presently in effect and all  amendments and  supplements  thereto
               being referred to herein as the "Prospectus"); and

               (vi) All  resolutions  of the  Board  of  Trustees  of the  Trust
               pertaining to the  management  of the assets of the Fund.

          implement any  amendment or supplement  that relates to or affects the
          obligations of the Sub-Adviser hereunder if the Sub-Adviser reasonably
          objects in writing  within five business days after  delivery  thereof
          (or such  shorter  period of time as the Adviser  shall  specify  upon
          delivery,  if such  shorter  period  of time is  reasonable  under the
          circumstances).

     3. ADVISORY FEE.

          (a)  For the services to be provided to the Fund by the Sub-Adviser as
               provided  in  Paragraph  2  hereof,  the  Adviser  will  pay  the
               Sub-Adviser  a minimum fee of $150,000 per year.  When the Fund's
               assets exceed $30 million, the Adviser and Sub-Adviser will share
               the  management  fee (as defined  below)  equally except that the
               Sub-Adviser's share would be subject to downward adjustments for:
               (1) the  Adviser's  incurred  costs and expenses of marketing the
               Bonnel  Fund  (including  prospectus  fulfillment,  Mr.  Bonnel's
               travel  costs,  annual costs for  marketing  and promotion of the
               Fund etc.) that exceed the .25%  "12b-1 fee"  charged to the Fund
               for  such  marketing  purposes;  (2)  for any  monies  previously
               received  as a result of the minimum  sub-advisory  fee set forth
               above  that were paid by the  Adviser  or the Trust  prior to the
               date that the  Securities  and Exchange  Commission  declared the
               Fund's   Registration   Statement  to  be   effective;   (3)  the
               unrecovered  costs of  organizing  the Bonnel  Fund up to $40,000
               (the  Adviser   will  be   responsible   for  bearing   costs  of
               organization  of the Fund in  excess  of  $40,000);  and (4) if a
               decision is made with respect to placing a cap on expenses to the
               extent that actual expenses of the Fund would exceed the cap, and
               the Adviser  would be required to pay or absorb any of the excess
               expenses,  by the amount of the excess  expenses paid or absorbed
               by the Adviser through such downward adjustments.  Advisor agrees
               to pay the  Sub-Advisor  the  minimum  fee for a period  of three
               years  provided Mr. Bonnel is ready,  willing and able to perform
               the Sub-Advisor's duties hereunder. The fee is payable in monthly
               installments  in  arrears.   The   "Management   Fee"  means  the
               management  fee  paid  by the  Trust  to the  Adviser  under  the
               Advisory  Agreement,  dated as of September 21, 1994, between the
               Trust and the Adviser with respect to the management of the Fund.

          (b)  In the case of termination  of the Agreement  during any calendar
               month,  the fee with  respect  to that  month  shall  be  reduced
               proportionately  based upon the number of  calendar  days  during
               which it is in  effect  and the fee  shall be  computed  upon the
               average net assets of the Fund for the days during which it is so
               in effect.

          (c)  The  "Monthly  Average Net  Assets" of the Fund for any  calendar
               month shall be equal to the quotient produced by dividing (i) the
               sum of the net assets of the Fund,  determined in accordance with
               procedures  established  from  time  to  time  by  or  under  the
               direction  of the Board of  Trustees  of the Trust in  accordance
               with the Master Trust  Agreement,  as of the close of business on
               each day during  such month that the Fund was open for  business,
               by (ii) the number of such days.

     4. EXPENSES.

          During  the term of this  Agreement,  the  Sub-Adviser  will  bear all
          expenses incurred by it in the performance of its duties hereunder.

     5. FUND TRANSACTIONS.

          The  Sub-Adviser  agrees  that  neither  it nor any of its  employees,
          officers or directors will take any long or short term position in the
          shares of the Fund or  portfolio  securities  of the Fund for  trading
          purposes;  provided,  however, that such prohibition shall not prevent
          the  purchase  of  shares  of the  Fund  by any of the  persons  above
          described for their  account and for  investment at the price at which
          such shares are available to the public at the time of purchase.

     6. REPRESENTATION AND WARRANTY.

          The Sub-Adviser  hereby represents and warrants to the Adviser that it
          is  duly  registered  as an  investment  adviser,  or is  exempt  from
          registration,  under the Investment Advisor's Act of 1940, as amended,
          and that it shall maintain such registration or exemption at all times
          during which this Agreement is in effect.

     7. LIABILITY OF SUB-ADVISER.

          In the performance of its duties under this Agreement, the Sub-Adviser
          shall act in conformity with and in compliance  with the  requirements
          of the 1940 Act and all other  applicable U.S.  Federal and state laws
          and  regulations  and shall not cause the Fund to take any action that
          would require the Fund or any affiliated person thereof to register as
          a  commodity  pool  operator  under  the  terms of the U.S.  Commodity
          Exchange Act, as amended (it being  understood by the Sub-Adviser that
          a notice of eligibility has been filed on behalf of the Trust pursuant
          to Rule 4.5  promulgated  under said Act).  The  Sub-Adviser  shall be
          responsible  for  maintaining  such  procedures  as may be  reasonably
          necessary to ensure that the investment and reinvestment of the Fund's
          assets  are made in  compliance  with its  investment  objectives  and
          policies and with all applicable  statues and regulations and that the
          Fund qualifies as a regulated investment company under Subchapter M of
          the Internal  Revenue  Code. No provision of this  Agreement  shall be
          deemed to protect the  Sub-Adviser  against any liability to the Trust
          or its  shareholders  to which it might otherwise be subject by reason
          of any  willful  misfeasance,  bad  faith or gross  negligence  in the
          performance of its duties or the reckless disregard of its obligations
          and duties under this Agreement.

     8. REPORTS.

          The  Sub-Adviser  shall  render to the Board of  Trustees of the Trust
          such  periodic  and  special  reports  as the  Board of  Trustees  may
          reasonably  request with respect to matters  relating to duties of the
          Sub- Adviser set forth herein.

     9. DURATION AND TERMINATION OF THIS AGREEMENT.

          (a)  Duration.  With respect to the Trust, this Agreement shall become
               effective  upon the date hereof and shall  continue in full force
               and  effect  from  year  to  year  thereafter  so  long  as  such
               continuance  is  approved  at least  annually  (i) by either  the
               Trustees of the Trust or by vote of a majority of the outstanding

               the Trust who are not parties to this  Agreement  or  "interested
               persons" (as defined in the 1940 Act) of any such party,  cast in
               person  at a meeting  called  for the  purpose  of voting on such
               approval.

          (b)  Termination.  With respect to the Trust,  this  Agreement  may be
               terminated  at any time,  without  payment of any  penalty (i) by
               vote of the Trustees of the Trust or by vote of a majority of the
               outstanding voting securities of the Fund (as defined in the 1940
               Act) on sixty (60)  days'  written  notice to the other  parties,
               (ii) by the  Adviser on sixty (60)  days'  written  notice to the
               other  parties or (iii) by the  Sub-Adviser  on ninety (90) days'
               written notice to the other parties.

          (c)  Automatic Termination.  With respect to the Trust, this Agreement
               shall automatically and immediately terminate in the event of its
               assignment or upon  expiration  of the Advisory  Agreement now or
               hereafter  in effect  between  the  Adviser  and the  Trust  with

               termination  of this  Sub-Advisory  Agreement with regards to the

               particular,  and without  limiting the foregoing,  so long as the
               Sub-Adviser  is ready,  willing  and able to  perform  its duties
               hereunder,  the Adviser shall pay the Sub-Adviser the minimum fee
               of $150,000,  even if this  Agreement  has been  terminated  with
               respect to the Trust.

     11. LIMITATION OF LIABILITY.

          (a)  THE TRUST.  The term  "Sophisticated  Investors  Funds" means and
               refers to the Trustees from time to time serving under the Master
               Trust  Agreement.  It is expressly agreed that the obligations of
               the  Trust  hereunder  shall  not  be  binding  upon  any  of the
               Trustees,  shareholders,  nominees, officers, agents or employees
               of the Trust,  personally,  but bind only the assets and property
               of the Trust,  as provided  in the Master  Trust  Agreement.  The
               execution and delivery of the Agreement  have been  authorized by
               the  Trustees  and  shareholders  of the Trust  and  signed by an
               authorized officer of the Trust, acting as such, and neither such
               authorization   by  such  Trustees  and   shareholders  nor  such
               execution  and delivery by such  officer  shall be deemed to have
               been made by any of them  individually or to impose any liability
               on any of them  personally,  but shall  bind only the  assets and
               property of the Trust as provided in its Master Trust  Agreement.
               
          (b)  THE  ADVISOR AND  SUB-ADVISOR.  It is  expressly  agreed that the
               oblations of the Advisor and Sub- Adviser  hereunder shall not be
               binding upon any of the shareholders,  nominees, officers, agents
               or employees of the Advisor or Sub-Adviser,  personally, but bind
               only the assets and  property  of the  Advisor  and  Sub-Adviser,
               respectively.  The execution  and delivery of the Agreement  have
               been  authorized by the directors and officers of the Advisor and
               Sub-Adviser  and signed by an  authorized  officer of the Advisor
               and Sub-Adviser,  acting as such, and neither such  authorization
               by such directors and officers nor such execution and delivery by
               such  officer  shall be  deemed  to have been made by any of them
               individually   or  to  impose  any   liability  on  any  of  them
               personally,  but shall bind only the assets and  property  of the
               Advisor  and  Sub-Adviser,   respectively.   This  limitation  of
               liability  shall  not be  deemed  to  protect  the  shareholders,
               nominees,  officers,  agents  or  employees  of the  Advisor  and
               Sub-Adviser   against   any   liability   to  the  Trust  or  its
               shareholders  to which they might  otherwise be subject by reason
               of any willful misfeasance,  bad faith or gross negligence in the
               performance  of their duties or the  reckless  disregard of their
               obligations and duties under this Agreement.

     12. MISCELLANEOUS.

          (a)  Notice.  Any notice  under this  Agreement  shall be in  writing,
               addressed and delivered or mailed,  postage prepaid, to the other
               parties at such  address as such other  parties may  designate in
               writing for the receipt of such notices.

          (b)  Severability. If any provision of this Agreement shall be held or
               made invalid by a court decision, statute, rule or otherwise, the
               remainder shall not be thereby affected.

          (c)  Applicable  Law. This Agreement  shall be construed in accordance
               with and governed by the laws of the State of Texas.

          (d)  This  Agreement and the Letter  Agreement  constitute  the entire
               agreement   of  the   parties   and   supersede   all   prior  or
               contemporaneous  written  or oral  negotiations,  correspondence,
               agreements  and  understandings,  regarding  the  subject  matter
               hereof.  To the extent that the Letter  Agreement is inconsistent
               with this Agreement, the terms of this Agreement shall control.

     13. STANDARD OF CARE.

          To the extent permitted under applicable law (including  section 36 of
          the 1940 Act), the Sub-Adviser  will not be liable to the Trust or the
          Adviser for any losses incurred by the Trust,  the Fund or the Adviser
          that arise out of or are in any way connected with any  recommendation
          or  other  act  or  failure  to  act of  the  Sub-Adviser  under  this
          Agreement,  including,  but not limited to, any error in judgment with
          respect to the Fund,  so long as such  recommendation  or other act or
          failure  to act does not  constitute  a  breach  of the  Sub-Adviser's
          fiduciary duty to the Trust, the Fund or the adviser. Anything in this
          section  13  or   otherwise   in  this   Agreement   to  the  contrary
          notwithstanding,  however, nothing herein shall constitute a waiver or
          limitation  of any rights that the Trust,  the Adviser or the Fund may
          have under any Federal or state securities laws.

     14. RIGHT OF SUB-ADVISER IN CORPORATE NAME

          The phrase  "Bonnel",  which comprises a component of the Fund's name,
          is a property  right of the Sub- Adviser.  The Trust,  the Adviser and
          the  Fund  agree  and  consent  that so long as this  Agreement  is in
          effect: (i) the Fund may use the phrase "Bonnel" as a component of its
          corporate name (including corporate documents,  sales literature,  and
          marketing)  and the Trust,  the Adviser and the Fund will not use that
          name for any other purpose; (ii) none of them will purport to grant to
          any third party the right to use the phrase  "Bonnel" for any purpose;
          (iii) the  Sub-Adviser or any corporate  affiliate of the Sub- Adviser
          may use or grant to others the right to use the phrase "Bonnel" or any
          combination  or  abbreviation  thereof,  as  all  or  a  portion  of a
          corporate or business name or for any commercial  purpose,  so long as
          there in no material adverse effect to the Fund, and at the request of
          the Sub- Adviser,  the Trust,  the Adviser and the Fund will take such
          actions as may be  required  to provide  their  consent to such use or
          grant; and (iv) on the termination of any investment advisory contract
          into which the Sub-Adviser and the Trust, the Adviser and the Fund may
          enter,  the trust,  the Adviser and the fund shall,  on request by the
          Sub-Adviser,  promptly take such action, at their own expense,  as may
          be  necessary  to  change  its  corporate  name to one not  containing
          "Bonnel" and following such change,  shall not use the phrase "Bonnel"
          or any  combination  thereof,  as a part of its corporate name, or for
          any other commercial purpose,  and shall use its best efforts to cause
          its officers,  directors and  stockholders to take any and all actions
          which the Sub-Adviser may request to effect the foregoing and recovery
          to the Sub-Adviser any and all rights to such phrase.

     IN WITNESS WHEREOF,  the Adviser, the Trust and the Sub-Adviser have caused
this Agreement to be executed on the day and year first above written.

               or  obligations   arising  under  this  Agreement  of  any  other
               Sub-Trust.

               of  Trustees  of the Trust and dated and  signed by an Officer of
               each party hereto, to this Agreement.

               Act. All such records  shall be the property of the Trust and the
               Transfer  Agent shall  deliver  such  records to the Trust or its
               designee upon request.

          (c)  The Transfer Agent shall make available  during regular  business
               hours all records and other data created and maintained  pursuant
               to this  Agreement  for  reasonable  audit and  inspection by the
               Trust,  or any  person  retained  by the Trust.  Upon  reasonable
               notice by the Trust,  the  Transfer  Agent  shall make  available
               during  regular   business  hours  its  facilities  and  premises
               employed in connection with its performance of this Agreement for
               reasonable visitation by the Trust, or any person retained by the
               Trust.

          (d)  At the expense of the Trust, the Transfer Agent shall maintain an
               adequate  supply of blank share  certificates  for each Sub-Trust
               providing for the issuance of  certificates  to meet the Transfer
               Agent's requirements  therefor.  Such share certificates shall be
               properly   signed   by   facsimile.   The  Trust   agrees   that,
               notwithstanding;  the  death,  resignation,  or  removal  of  any
               officer   of  the  Trust   whose   signature   appears   on  such
               certificates,  the  Transfer  Agent may  continue to  countersign
               certificates  which bear such signatures  until other directed by
               the Trust.  Share  certificates  may be issued and  accounted for
               entirely by the Transfer Agent and do not require any third party
               registrar or other endorsing party.

          (e)  The Transfer Agent shall issue replacement share  certificates in
               lieu of certificates  which have been lost,  stolen or destroyed,
               without  any  further  action  by the  Board of  Trustees  or any
               Officer  of the Trust,  upon  receipt  by the  Transfer  Agent of
               properly executed  affidavits and lost certificate bonds, in form
               satisfactory  to the  Transfer  Agent,  with  the  Trust  and the
               Transfer Agent as obligees under replacement certificates without
               requiring the affidavits  and lost  certificate  bonds  described
               above  and the  Transfer  Agent  agrees  to  indemnify  the Trust
               against any and all losses or claims which may arise by reason of
               the  issuance  of such new  certificates  in the place of the one
               allegedly  lost,  stolen or  destroyed.  

          (f)  The  Transfer   Agent  shall  also  maintain  a  record  of  each
               certificate  issued, the number of Shares represented thereby and
               the  holder  of  record.  With  respect  to  shares  held in open
               account,  i.e. no certificate  being issued with respect thereto,
               the  Transfer  Agent  shall  maintain  comparable  records of the
               record  holders  thereof,   including  their  addresses  and  tax
               identification numbers. The Transfer Agent shall further maintain
               a stop transfer record on lost and/or replaced certificates.

          (g)  The   Transfer   Agent  will   address   and  mail  all   account
               communication by the Trust to its Shareholders, including reports
               to Shareholders and dividend and distribution notices.

          (h)  The Transfer Agent will  investigate  all  Shareholder  inquiries
               relating   to   Shareholder   accounts   and  will   answer   all
               correspondence  from  Shareholders,  securities brokers and other
               relating to its duties hereunder and such other correspondence as
               may  from  time to time  be  mutually  agreed  upon  between  the
               Transfer Agent and the Trust.

          (i)  The  Transfer  Agent  shall  furnish  the  Trust  state  by state
               registration  reports,  such  period and  special  reports as the
               Trust  may  reasonably  request,   and  such  other  information,
               including   Shareholder   lists   and   statistical   information
               concerning  accounts  as may be  agreed  upon  from  time to time
               between the Trust and the Transfer Agent.

          (j)  In connection with special meetings of Shareholders, the Transfer
               Agent  will  prepare  Shareholder  lists,  process  and  tabulate
               returned proxy cards,  report on proxies voted prior to meetings,
               act as teller at meetings and certify Shares voted at meetings.

     9.   SALE OF TRUST SHARES.

          (a)  Whenever the Trust shall sell or cause to be sold any Shares of a
               Sub-Trust,  the Trust shall  deliver or cause to be  delivered to
               the Transfer Agent a Certificate duly specifying: (i) the name of
               the Sub-Trust  whose Shares were sold;  (ii) the number of Shares
               sold,  trade  date,  and  price;  (iii) the amount of money to be
               delivered  to the  Custodian  for the  sale of  such  Shares  and
               specifically allocated to such Sub-Trust; and (iv) in the case of
               a  new  account,   a  new  account   application   or  sufficient
               information to establish an account.

          (b)  The Transfer  Agent will,  upon receipt by it of a check or other
               payment identified by it as an investment in Shares of one of the
               Sub-Trusts  and drawn or endorsed to the Transfer  Agent as agent
               for,  or  identified  as being  for the  account  of,  one of the
               Sub-Trusts,  promptly  deposit such check or other payment to the
               appropriate   account,   postings   necessary   to  reflect   the
               investment.  The  Transfer  Agent will  notify the Trust,  or its
               designee,  and the Custodian of all purchases and related account
               adjustments.

          (c)  Under procedures as established by mutual  agreement  between the
               Trust and the Transfer  Agent,  the Transfer Agent shall issue to
               the  purchaser  or his  authorized  agent  such  Shares  as he is
               entitled to receive,  based on the appropriate net asset value of
               the Sub-Trust's Shares,  determined in accordance with applicable
               Federal law or  regulation.  In issuing  Shares to a purchaser or
               his  authorized  agent,  the Transfer  Agent shall be entitled to
               rely upon the latest directions,  if any,  previously received by
               the Transfer  Agent from the  purchaser or his  authorized  agent
               concerning the delivery of such Shares.

          (d)  The  Transfer  Agent shall not be required to issue any Shares of
               the Trust where it has  received a Written  Instruction  from the
               Trust or written  notification  from any  appropriate  Federal or
               state  authority  that the sale of the Shares of the Sub-Trust in
               question  has been  suspended or  discontinued,  and the Transfer
               Agent shall be entitled to rely upon such written Instructions or
               written notification.

          (e)  Upon the issuance of any Shares of any  Sub-Trust  in  accordance
               with the foregoing provision of this Section,  the Transfer Agent
               shall not be responsible for the payment of any original issue or
               other taxes  required to be paid by the Trust in connection  with
               such issuance.

          (f)  The  Transfer  Agent  may  establish  such  additional  rules and
               regulations  governing the transfer or  registration of Shares as
               it  may  deem  advisable  and  consistent  with  such  rules  and
               regulations generally adopted by transfer agents.

     10.  RETURNED  CHECKS.  In the event that any check or other  order for the
          transfer of money is  returned  unpaid for any  reason,  the  Transfer
          Agent  will  take  such  steps  as  the  Transfer  Agent  may,  in its
          discretion,  deem appropriate to protect the Trust from financial loss
          or as the  Trust  or its  designee  may  instruct.  Provided  that the
          standard  procedures,  as agreed  upon from time to time,  between the
          Trust and the Transfer Agent,  regarding  purchases and redemptions of
          shares, are adhered to by the Transfer Agent, the Transfer Agent shall
          not be liable for any loss  suffered by the  Sub-Trust  as a result of
          returned or unpaid purchase or redemption transactions. Legal or other
          expenses  incurred  to  collect  amounts  owed  to  a  Sub-Trust  as a
          consequence of returned or unpaid  purchase or redemption  transaction
          shall be an expense of that Sub-Trust. A Sub-Trust may, at its option,
          purchase  insurance  to reduce its  potential  losses from  collection
          activities.  

     11.  REDEMPTIONS.  Shares of any  Sub-Trust  may be redeemed in  accordance
          with the  procedures  set forth in the Prospectus of the Trust and the
          Transfer Agent will duly process all redemption requests.

     12.  TRANSFER AND EXCHANGES. The Transfer Agent is authorized to review and
          process  transfers  of Shares  of each  Sub-Trust,  exchanges  between
          Sub-Trusts on the records of the Sub-Trusts maintained by the Transfer
          Agent,  and  exchanges  between  the Trust  and other  funds as may be
          permitted by the prospectus of the Trust.  If Shares to be transferred
          are represented by outstanding certificates,  the Transfer Agent will,
          upon surrender to it of the  certificates in proper form for transfer,
          and upon cancellation thereof,  countersign and issue new certificates
          for a like number of Shares and deliver the same.  If the Shares to be
          transferred  are not  represented  by  outstanding  certificates,  the
          Transfer  Agent  will,  upon an order  therefor by or on behalf of the
          registered  holder  thereof  in proper  form,  credit  the same to the
          transferee  on its books.  If Shares are to be exchanged for Shares of
          another  fund,  the Transfer  Agent will process such  exchange in the
          same manner as a redemption  of sale of Shares,  except that it may in
          its discretion waive requirements for information and documentation.

     13.  RIGHT TO SEE  ASSURANCES.  The  Transfer  Agent  reserves the right to
          refuse to transfer or redeem  Shares  until it is  satisfied  that the
          requested transfer or redemption is legally  authorized,  and it shall
          incur no liability for the refusal,  in good faith,  to make transfers
          or  redemptions  which the  Transfer  Agent,  in its  judgment,  deems
          improper or  unauthorized,  or until it is satisfied  that there is no
          basis  for any claim  adverse  to such  transfer  or  redemption.  The
          Transfer Agent may, in effecting  transfers,  rely upon the provisions
          of the  Uniform  Act  for the  Simplification  of  Fiduciary  Security
          Transfers or the Uniform  Commercial  Code, as the same may be amended
          from time to time, which in the opinion of legal counsel for the Trust
          or of its  own  legal  counsel  protect  it in not  requiring  certain
          documents in  connection  with the transfer or redemption of Shares of
          any Sub- Trust,  and the Trust shall  indemnify the Transfer Agent for
          any act done or omitted by it in  reliance  upon such laws of opinions
          of counsel of the Trust or its own counsel. 

     14.  DISTRIBUTIONS.

          (a)  The  Trust  will  promptly  notify  the  Transfer  Agent  of  the
               declaration  of any  dividend  or  distribution.  The Trust shall
               furnish  to the  Transfer  Agent a  resolution  of the  Board  of
               Trustees of the Trust certified by the Secretary; (i) authorizing
               the  declaration  of  dividends  on a specified  period basis and
               authorizing the Transfer Agent to rely on Oral  Instructions or a
               Certificate  specifying  the  date  of the  declaration  of  such
               dividend or distribution, the date of payment thereof, the record
               date as of  which  Shareholders  entitled  to  payment  shall  be
               determined  and the amount payable per share to  Shareholders  of
               record  as of that  date  and the  total  amount  payable  to the
               Transfer  Agent of the Trust on the payment date; or (ii) setting
               forth the date of the declaration of any dividend or distribution
               by a Sub-Trust,  the date of payment thereof,  the record date as
               of which  Shareholders  entitled to payment shall be  determined,
               and the amount payable per share to the Shareholders of record as
               of that date and the total amount  payable to the Transfer  Agent
               on the payment date. 

          (b)  The Transfer  Agent,  on behalf of the Trust,  shall instruct the
               Custodian to place in a dividend  disbursing  account funds equal
               to the cash  amount of any  dividend or  distribution  to be paid
               out. The Transfer Agent will  calculate,  prepare and mail checks
               to, or (where  appropriate)  credit such dividend or distribution
               to the account  of,  Sub-Trust  Shareholders,  and  maintain  and
               safeguard all underlying records.

          (c)  The Transfer Agent will replace lost checks at its discretion and
               in conformity with regular business practices.

          (d)  The Transfer Agent will maintain all records necessary to reflect
               the crediting of dividends  which are reinvested in Shares of the
               Trust, including without limitation daily dividends.

          (e)  The Transfer Agent shall not be liable for any improper  payments
               made in accordance  with a resolution of the Board of Trustees of
               the Trust.

          (f)  If the  Transfer  Agent  shall  not  receive  from the  Custodian
               sufficient cash to make payment to all  shareholders of the Trust
               as of the record date, the Transfer  Agent shall,  upon notifying
               the Trust,  withhold  payment to all Shareholders of record as of
               the record  date until such  sufficient  cash is  provided to the
               Transfer Agent.

     15.  OTHER DUTIES. In addition to the duties expressly provided for herein,
          the Transfer  Agent shall  perform such other duties and functions and
          shall be paid such amounts therefor as may from time to time be agreed
          in writing.

     16.  TAXES.  It is  understood  that the  Transfer  Agent  shall  file such
          appropriate  information  returns  concerning the payment of dividends
          and capital  gain  distributions  with the proper  Federal,  State and
          local  authorities as are required by law to be filed by the Trust and
          shall  withhold such sums as are required to be withheld by applicable
          law.

     17.  BOOKS AND RECORDS.

          (a)  The  Transfer  Agent  shall  maintain  records  showing  for each
               Shareholder's account the following: (i) names, addresses and tax
               identification   numbers;  (ii)  number  of  Shares  held;  (iii)
               historical information regarding the account of each Shareholder,
               including  dividends paid and date and price of all  transactions
               on a Shareholder's  account;  (iv) any stop or restraining  order
               placed against a  Shareholder's  account;  (v)  information  with
               respect  to  withholdings;  (vi)  any  capital  gain or  dividend
               reinvestment  order,  plan  application,   dividend  address  and
               correspondence   relating  to  the  current   maintenance   of  a
               Shareholder's    account;    (vii)   certificate    numbers   and
               denominations for any Shareholders holding  certificates;  (viii)
               any  information  required  in order  for the  Transfer  Agent to
               perform  the  calculations   contemplated  or  required  by  this
               Agreement;  and (ix) such  other  information  and data as may be
               required by applicable law.

          (b)  Any  records  required to be  maintained  by Rule 31a-1 under the
               1940 Act will be  preserved  for the periods  prescribed  in Rule
               31a-2 under the 1940 Act.  Such  records may be  inspected by the
               Trust at reasonable  times. The Transfer Agent may, at its option
               at any time, and shall  forthwith upon the Trust's  demand,  turn
               over to the Trust and  cease to  retain in the  Transfer  Agent's
               files,  records  and  documents  created  and  maintained  by the
               Transfer  Agent  in  performance  of  its  services  or  for  its
               protection.  At the end of the six-year  retention  period,  such
               records and documents will either be turned over to the Trust, or
               destroyed in accordance with the Trust's authorization.

     18.  RELIANCE BY TRANSFER AGENT; INSTRUCTIONS.

          (a)  The Transfer Agent shall be protected in acting upon any paper or
               document  believed by it to be genuine and to have been signed by
               an Authorized  Person and shall not be held to have any notice of
               any change of authority  of any person  until  receipt of written
               certification  thereof from the Trust. It shall also be protected
               in processing Share certificates which it reasonably  believes to
               bear the proper manual or facsimile signatures.

          (b)  At any time the Transfer Agent may apply to any Authorized Person
               of the Trust for Written Instructions, and, at the expense of the
               Trust,  may seek advice  from legal  counsel for the Trust or its
               own  legal  counsel,  with  respect  to  any  matter  arising  in
               connection  with this  Agreement,  and it shall not be liable for
               any action  taken or not taken or suffered by it in good faith in
               accordance with such Written  Instructions or with the opinion of
               such  counsel.  In addition,  the Transfer  Agent,  its officers,
               agents or employees,  shall accept instructions or requests given
               to them by any  person  representing  or  acting on behalf of the
               Trust only if said representative is known by the Transfer Agent,
               its officers,  agents or employees,  to be an Authorized  Person.
               The Transfer  Agent shall have no duty or  obligation  to inquire
               into,  nor shall  the  Transfer  Agent be  responsible  for,  the
               legality of any act done by it upon the request or  direction  of
               Authorized Persons of the Trust.

          (c)  Notwithstanding   any  of  the   foregoing   provisions  of  this
               Agreement,   the  Transfer  Agent  shall  be  under  no  duty  or
               obligation to inquire into,  and shall not be liable for: (i) the
               legality of the issue or sale of any Shares of the Trust,  or the
               sufficiency  of the  amount  to be  received  therefor;  (ii) the
               legality  of the  redemption  of any Shares of the Trust,  or the
               propriety of the amount to be paid  therefor;  (iii) the legality
               of the  declaration of any dividend by the Trust, or the legality
               of the issue of any  Shares of the Trust in  payment of any stock
               dividend;  or  (iv)  the  legality  of  any  recapitalization  of
               readjustment of the Shares of the Trust.

     19.  STANDARD OF CARE AND INDEMNIFICATION.

          (a)  The Transfer Agent may, in connection with this Agreement, employ
               agents or attorneys in fact, and shall not be liable for any loss
               arising  out of or in  connection  with its  actions  under  this
               Agreement  so  long  as it  acts  in  good  faith  and  with  due
               diligence,  and is  not  negligent  or  guilty  of any  willfully
               misconduct.

          (b)  The  Trust  hereby  agrees to  indemnify  and hold  harmless  the
               Transfer  Agent from and  against  any and all  claims,  demands,
               expenses and  liabilities  (whether with or without basis in fact
               of law) of any and  every  nature  which the  Transfer  Agent may
               sustain or incur or which may be asserted  against  the  Transfer
               Agent by any  person by reason  of,  or as a result  of:  (i) any
               action taken or omitted to be taken by the Transfer Agent in good
               faith in  reliance  upon any  Certificate,  instrument,  order or
               stock certificate  believed by it to be genuine and to be signed,
               countersigned or executed by any duly authorized person, upon the
               Oral Instructions or Written Instructions of an Authorized Person
               of the Trust or upon the  opinion of legal  counsel for the Trust
               or its own counsel; or (ii) any good action taken or permitted to
               be taken by the Transfer Agent in connection with its appointment
               in good  faith  in  reliance  upon any law,  act,  regulation  or
               interpretation  of the same even  though the same may  thereafter
               have  been  altered,  changed,  amended  or  repealed.   However,
               indemnification hereunder shall not apply to actions or omissions

               agents in cases of its own negligence,  willful  misconduct,  bad
               faith,  or  reckless   disregard  of  its  or  their  own  duties

EX 10.5

                             SUB-ADVISORY AGREEMENT

     AGREEMENT  made as of the 20th day of January,  1995 among UNITED  SERVICES
ADVISORS,  INC., a  corporation  organized  under the laws of the State of Texas
(the  "Adviser"),  UNITED SERVICES FUNDS, a Massachusetts  business trust having
its principal place of business in San Antonio,  Texas (the "Trust"),  on behalf
of the China Region  Opportunity  Fund (the  "Fund"),  a series of shares of the
Trust,  and  Batterymarch  Financial  Management,   Inc.  ("BFM,  Inc."),  whose
principal place of business is Boston, Massachusetts (the "Sub-Adviser").

     WHEREAS,  the Adviser is engaged in the  business of  rendering  investment
management services to the Trust; and

     WHEREAS,  the Trust is an open-end management  investment company and is so
registered under the Investment Company Act of 1940 (the "1940 Act"); and

     WHEREAS,  the Trust is operated as a "series company" within the meaning of
Rule  18f-2  under  the 1940 Act and has  fifteen  separate  series of shares of
beneficial interest, one of which series is the Fund.

     NOW,  THEREFORE,  WITNESSETH:  That it is hereby agreed between the parties
hereto as follows:

     1.   APPOINTMENT OF SUB-ADVISER.

          The  Sub-Adviser is hereby  appointed to provide  investment  advisory
          services to the Fund for the period and on the terms herein set forth.
          The  Sub-Adviser  accepts  such  appointment  and agrees to render the
          services herein set forth, for the compensation herein provided.

     2.   DUTIES OF SUB-ADVISER.

          (a)  The  Sub-Adviser  is hereby  authorized  and  directed and hereby
               agrees,  subject to the stated investment  objective and policies
               of the Fund as set forth in the  Fund's  Prospectus  (as  defined
               below) and  subject to the  supervision  of the  Adviser  and the
               Board of Trustees of the Trust,  (i) to  develop,  recommend  and
               implement  such  investment  program and strategy for the Fund as
               may  from  time  to  time  in  the   circumstances   appear  most
               appropriate to the achievement of the investment objective of the
               Fund as  stated  in the  aforesaid  Prospectus,  (ii) to  provide
               research  and  analysis  relative to the  investment  program and
               investments  of the  Fund,  (iii) to  determine  what  securities
               should be  purchased  and sold and what  portion of the assets of
               the Fund should be held in cash or cash  equivalents  and (iv) to
               monitor on a continuing  basis the  performance  of the portfolio
               securities of the Fund. The  Sub-Adviser  will advise the Trust's
               custodian  and the Adviser on a prompt basis of each purchase and
               sale of a portfolio  security  specifying the name of the issuer,
               the  description  and amount or number of shares of the  security
               purchased,  the market price,  commission and gross or net price,
               trade date,  settlement date and identity of the effecting broker
               or dealer. From time to time, as the Trustees of the Trust or the
               Adviser may reasonably  request,  the Sub-Adviser will furnish to
               the  Trust's  officers  and to each of its  Trustees  reports  on
               portfolio  transactions  and reports on issues of securities held
               in the portfolio,  all in such detail as the Trust or the Adviser
               may  reasonably  request.  The  Sub-Adviser  will also inform the
               Trust's  officers and  Trustees on a current  basis of changes in
               investment  strategy or tactics.  The  Sub-Adviser  will make its
               officers  and  employees  available  to  meet  with  the  Trust's
               officers and Trustees on due notice to review the investments and
               investment program of the Fund.

               The Sub-Adviser  shall place all orders for the purchase and sale
               of portfolio  securities for the account of the Fund with brokers
               or dealers selected by the  Sub-Adviser,  although the Trust will
               pay the actual brokerage  commissions and any transfer taxes with
               respect to transactions in the portfolio securities of the Trust.
               The   Sub-Adviser   is   authorized  to  submit  any  such  order
               collectively  with orders on behalf of other  accounts  under its
               management,  provided that the Sub-Adviser  shall have determined
               that such  action is in the best  interest  of the Fund and is in
               accordance with applicable law,  including,  without  limitation,
               Rule  17d-1   under  the  1940  Act.   In   executing   portfolio
               transactions and selecting  brokers or dealers,  the Sub- Adviser
               will use its best  efforts to seek on behalf of the Fund the best
               overall  terms  available.  In assessing  the best overall  terms
               available for any transaction, the Sub-Adviser shall consider all
               factors it deems relevant, including the breadth of the market in
               the security,  the price of the security, the financial condition
               and  execution  capability  of the  broker  or  dealer,  and  the
               reasonableness  of the  commission,  if  any  (for  the  specific
               transaction  and on a continuing  basis).  In evaluating the best
               overall terms available, and in selecting the broker or dealer to
               execute  a  particular  transaction,  the  Sub-Adviser  may  also
               consider  the  brokerage  and  research  services (as those terms
               defined in Section 28(e) of the Securities  Exchange Act of 1934)
               provided  to the  Fund  and/or  other  accounts  over  which  the
               Sub-Adviser  or  an  affiliate  of  the   Sub-Adviser   exercises
               investment discretion.  The Sub-Adviser is authorized to pay to a
               broker  or  dealer  who  provides  such  brokerage  and  research
               services a commission for executing a portfolio  transaction  for
               the Fund which is in excess of the amount of  commission  another
               broker  or  dealer   would  have  charged  for   effecting   that
               transaction if, but only if, the  Sub-Adviser  determines in good
               faith that such  commission  was  reasonable  in  relation to the
               value of the  brokerage  and research  services  provided by such
               broker or dealer, viewed in terms of that particular  transaction
               or in  terms  of  all  of  the  accounts  over  which  investment
               discretion  is  so  exercised.   An  affiliated   person  of  the
               Sub-Adviser may provide  brokerage  services to the Fund provided
               that the  Sub-Adviser  shall have  determined that such action is
               consistent  with its  obligation  to seek the best overall  terms
               available and is in accordance with  applicable  law,  including,
               without limitation,  Section 17(e) of the 1940 Act. The foregoing
               shall not be  deemed to  authorize  an  affiliated  person of the
               Sub-Adviser  to  enter  into   transactions   with  the  Fund  as
               principal.

               In the  performance of its duties  hereunder,  the Sub-Adviser is
               and  shall be an  independent  contractor  and  unless  otherwise
               expressly  provided or authorized  shall have no authority to act
               for or  represent  the Trust in any way or otherwise be deemed to
               be an agent of the Trust or of the Adviser.

          (b)  Delivery of  Documents.  The Adviser will furnish upon request or
               has  furnished  the Sub-  Adviser with true copies of each of the
               following:

                    Agreement,  as presently in effect and as it shall from time

                    Agreement");

               (ii) The Trust's By-Laws and amendments thereto (such By-Laws, as
                    presently  in  effect  and as it shall  from time to time be

               (iii)Resolutions  of the Trust's  Board of  Trustees  authorizing

               of each  calendar  month,  which  fee shall be paid at a rate set

               procedures  established  from  time  to  time  by  or  under  the
               direction  of the Board of  Trustees  of the Trust in  accordance
               with the Master Trust  Agreement,  as of the close of business on
               each day during  such month that the Fund was open for  business,
               by (ii) the number of such days.

     4.   EXPENSES.

          During  the term of this  Agreement,  the  Sub-Adviser  will  bear all
          expenses incurred by it in the performance of its duties hereunder.

     5.   FUND TRANSACTIONS.

          The  Sub-Adviser  agrees  that  neither  it nor  any of its  trustees,
          employees,  officers  or  directors  will take any long or short  term
          position  in the  shares of the  Fund;  provided,  however,  that such
          prohibition  shall not prevent  the  purchase of shares of the Fund by
          any  of  the  persons  above  described  for  their  account  and  for
          investment  at the price at which  such  shares are  available  to the
          public at the time of purchase.

     6.   REPRESENTATION AND WARRANTY.

          The Sub-Adviser  hereby represents and warrants to the Adviser that it
          is  duly  registered  as an  investment  adviser,  or is  exempt  from
          registration,  under the Investment Advisor's Act of 1940, as amended,
          and that it shall maintain such registration or exemption at all times
          during which this Agreement is in effect.

     7.   LIABILITY OF SUB-ADVISER.

          In the performance of its duties under this Agreement, the Sub-Adviser
          shall act in conformity with and in compliance  with the  requirements
          of the 1940 Act and all other  applicable U.S.  Federal and state laws
          and  regulations  and shall not cause the Fund to take any action that
          would require the Fund or any affiliated person thereof to register as
          a  commodity  pool  operator  under  the  terms of the U.S.  Commodity
          Exchange Act, as amended (it being  understood by the Sub-Adviser that
          a notice of eligibility has been filed on behalf of the Trust pursuant
          to Rule 4.5  promulgated  under said Act).  The  Sub-Adviser  shall be
          responsible  for  maintaining  such  procedures  as may be  reasonably

          assets  are made in  compliance  with its  investment  objectives  and
          policies and with all applicable statues and regulations. No provision
          of this Agreement shall be deemed to protect the  Sub-Adviser  against
          any  liability  to the  Trust  or its  shareholders  to which it might
          otherwise be subject by reason of any willful  misfeasance,  bad faith
          or gross  negligence in the  performance of its duties or the reckless
          disregard of its obligations and duties under this Agreement.

     8.   REPORTS.

               any such  party,  cast in  person  at a  meeting  called  for the
               purpose of voting on such approval.

          deemed exclusive, and the Sub- Adviser shall be free to render similar
          services to others.

     11.  LIMITATION OF LIABILITY.

               but bind only the assets and  property of the Trust,  as provided
               in the Master Trust Agreement.  The execution and delivery of the
               Agreement have been  authorized by the Trustees and  shareholders
               of the Trust and  signed by an  authorized  officer of the Trust,
               acting as such, and neither such  authorization  by such Trustees
               and  shareholders nor such execution and delivery by such officer
               shall be deemed to have been made by any of them  individually or
               to impose any liability on any of them personally, but shall bind
               only the  assets and  property  of the Trust as  provided  in its
               Master Trust Agreement.

     12.  PROXY VOTING.

          Decisions on voting of proxies will be made by or under the  direction
          of the Sub-Adviser.

               addressed and delivered or mailed,  postage prepaid, to the other

               writing for the receipt of such notices.

          (b)  Severability. If any provision of this Agreement shall be held or
               made invalid by a court decision, statute, rule or otherwise, the
               remainder shall not be thereby affected.

          (c)  Applicable  Law. This Agreement  shall be construed in accordance
               with and governed by the laws of the State of Texas.
