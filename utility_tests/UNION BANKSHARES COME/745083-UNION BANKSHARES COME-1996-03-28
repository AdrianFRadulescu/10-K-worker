                                   PART I

ITEM I:  Business

Union Bankshares Company is a one-bank holding company, organized under the
laws of the State of Maine, which has acquired 99.928% of the common stock
of the Union Trust Company (the Bank).  The Company's only subsidiary is the
Bank.  The Company's holding company structure can be utilized to engage in
permitted banking-related activities, either directly or through newly
formed subsidiaries, or by acquiring companies already established in such
activities.  The Company has no immediate plans for such activities, but
could do so, if such action should appear desirable.

Union Trust is a full-service, independent commercial bank with ten offices
in coastal Maine, serving the financial needs of individuals, businesses, 
and municipalities in Hancock and Washington Counties.  Commitment to
outstanding service, quality products and the ability to anticipate and
respond to the customers financial needs, Union Trust, now in its 107th
year, is proud to have earned the reputation as one of New England's
preeminent community banks.

Union Trust supports the people and communities it serves and believes that
reinvesting local money locally builds strong communities.  The Bank's
charitable contribution program supports a broad range of local charities,
community development efforts and the volunteerism of its employees and
retirees.

Union Trust Company offers a full range of banking services, at competitive
rates, at convenient banking hours and locations and is accessible to our
customers 24 hours a day through physical locations and electronic means. 
This year the Bank introduced "BankLine" which provides 24 hour access by
phone, whereby customers may check the balance of their checking account,
check recent account activity, verify interest paid and earned, transfer
funds and make loan payments.

Union Trust's deposit services include:  regular and basic checking
accounts, NOW accounts, Money Market accounts, savings accounts,
Certificates of Deposits, IRA accounts, KEOGH Plans, ATM Convenience Card,
Convenience Check Card, Reserve Checking, credit cards, BankLine, Unlimited
Club membership and safe deposit boxes.  The Bank also provides the
following loan services:  installment loans, student loans, mortgages, lines
of credit, commercial loans, home equity loans and Visa credit cards.

Union Trust also offers a full range of investment and trust services.  Our
professional trust advisors design and administer personal trusts,
individual retirement accounts, self-employed retirement accounts, company
retirement plans (pension, simplified employee pension, 401(k), profit
sharing), and estate plans.  In addition, our trust staff will help people
of all ages and income levels analyze their savings and retirement needs and
plan customized investment strategies to meet the customer's goal.  In 1995,
the trust department introduced "Mutual Partners", an Asset Allocation
Program that offers a balanced investment mechanism for our customer.  Using
mutual funds and creating portfolios designed to meet each person's
individual situation and risk level, the Bank hopes to appeal to a broad
range of potential trust customers, many of whom might otherwise think that
they don't have enough savings to qualify for a trust.


                                3 of 23<PAGE>


The Bank competes actively with other commercial banks and other financial
institutions in its service areas.  Strong competition exists among
commercial banks in efforts to obtain new deposits, in the scope and type of
services offered, in interest rates on time deposits and interest rates
charged on loans, and in other aspects of banking.  In Maine, savings banks
are major competitors of commercial banks as a result of broadened powers
granted to savings banks.  In addition, the Bank like other commercial
banks, encounters substantial competition from other financial institutions
engaged in the business of either making loans or accepting deposit
accounts, such as savings and loan associations, insurance companies,
certain mutual funds, and certain governmental agencies.  Furthermore, the
large banks located in Boston, New York, and Providence are active in
servicing some of the large Maine based companies.

As of December 31, 1995 the Bank employed 120 employees of which 14
employees were part-time.

The primary regulator of the Company and the Bank is the Federal Reserve
Bank of Boston.

Please refer to Management's Discussion and Analysis, on page 6 of the 1995
Annual Report of Union Bankshares Company, regarding compliance with capital
requirements.

Any loans classified for regulatory purposes as loss, doubtful, substandard,
or special mention that were not disclosed under Item III of Industry Guide
3 do not (1) represent or result from trends or uncertainties which
management reasonably expects will materially impact future operating
results, liquidity, or capital resources or (2) represent material credits
about which management is aware of any information which causes management
to have serious doubts as to the ability of such borrowers to comply with
the loan repayment terms.

The Company and Bank are not aware of any current recommendations by the
regulatory authorities which if they were to be implemented would have or
would be reasonably likely to have a material effect on the Company's
liquidity, capital resources or operations.

Loans, other than credit card loans, are placed on nonaccrual status when,
in the opinion of management, there are doubts as to collectibility of
interest or principal,  or when principal or interest is past due 90 days or
more, and the loan is not well secured and in the process of collection. 
Interest previously accrued but not collected is reversed and charged
against interest income at the time the related loan is placed on nonaccrual
status.  Principal and accrued interest on credit card loans are charged to
the allowance for credit losses when 180 days past due.

Interest payments received on nonaccrual loans are recorded as reductions of
principal if principal payment is doubtful.

Loans are considered to be restructured when the yield on the restructured
assets is reduced below the current market rates by an agreement with the
borrower.  Generally this occurs when the cash flow of the borrower  is
insufficient to service the loan under its original terms.

It is the policy of the Company to discontinue the accrual of interest on 
loans when, in the  opinion of the management, the ultimate collectibility
of principal or interest becomes doubtful.  The  principal amount of loans 
which have been placed on non-accrual status were comprised primarily  of 
certain installment loans.  For each of these loans, management has evaluated
the collectibility of the principal based on its best estimate of the 
realizable collateral value of the loans and does not anticipate that any 
losses from liquidation of these loans will have a material effect on future 
operations.  There were approximately $614,000, $151,000, and $486,000 as of
December 31, 1995, 1994 and 1993, respectively, of loans on a non-accrual 
status.

                            LOANS CONCENTRATIONS
As of December 31, 1995 and 1994, the company did not have any concentration 
of loans in one particular industry that exceeded 10% of its total loan 
portfolio.

The Bank grants residential, commercial and consumer loans to customers 
principally located in Hancock and Washington Counties of the State of Maine.
Although the loan portfolio is diversified, a substantial portion of its 
debtor's ability to honor their contracts is dependent upon the economic 
conditions in the area, especially in the real estate sector.  There are 
currently no borrowers whose total indebtedness to the Bank exceeds 10% of 
the Bank's Shareholders' equity at December 31, 1995.

The allowance for loan losses is a general allowance established by 
management to absorb possible loan losses as they may exist in the loan
portfolio.  This allowance is increased by provisions charged to operating
expenses and by recoveries on loans previously charged-off.  Management 
determines the adequacy of the allowance from continuous reviews of the
quality of new and existing loans, from the results of independent reviews of 
the loan portfolio by regulatory agency examiners, evaluation of past
and anticipated loan loss experience, the character and size of the loan
portfolio and anticipated economic conditions.

As of December 31, 1995, the Company had impaired loans totaling some 
$59,000, which consisted of commercial and real estate loans.  The fair
value of the loan's collateral was used in all instances to determine present
value. 

A loan is considered impaired by management when it is probable that the
creditor will be unable to collect all amounts due under the contractual 
terms of the loan, including principal and interest.  Loans on a non-
accrual status that are deemed collectable are not classified as impaired. 
Based upon managements periodic review of loans on non-accrual status, 
impairment is based on a loan by loan analysis and not set by a defined
period of delinquency before a loan is considered impaired. 

The adoption of Statement 114 has had no material affect on the
comparability of prior reporting periods.

In accordance with Industry Guide 3 Item III. c (2), the gross interest
income that would have been recorded in 1995 if non-accrual and restructured 
loans had been current in accordance with their original terms and had been 
outstanding throughout the period or since origination approximates $28,000. 
There was some $2,000 included in the gross interest income on non-accrual 
and restructured loans for 1995.

The following table sets forth, for the periods indicated, information 
regarding (1) the total dollar amount of interest income of the Company from 
interest-earning assets and the resulting average yields; (2) the total 
dollar amount of interest expense on interest bearing liabilities and the 
resulting average cost; (3) net interest income; (4) interest rate spread; 
and (5) net interest margin.  Information is based on average daily balances 
during the indicated periods.  For the purposes of the table and the 
following discussion, (1) income from interest earning assets and net 
interest income are not presented on a tax equivalent basis primarily by 
adjusting income and yields earned on tax exempt interest received on loans 
and certain investments to make them equivalent to income and yields earned 
on fully taxable investments - assuming federal income tax rates of 34% in 
1995, 1994 and 1993, respectively, and (2) non-accrual loans have been 
included in the appropriate average balance loan category, but unpaid 
interest on non-accrual loans has not been included for purposes of
determining interest income.

                              BANK'S PROPERTIES
ITEM 2:  PROPERTIES
The Bank's principal office is located at 66 Main Street in Ellsworth,
Maine.  The main office building consists of three floors, all of which are 
utilized by the Bank for banking facilities and administrative offices. 
The principal office includes a separate drive-up facility and parking lot.  
In August, 1981, plans were finalized for the construction of an 8,000
square foot addition to our existing building.  Completed in November of
1982, it provided new and enlarged customer service/teller area with street 
level access.  During 1982 and 1983, the existing building also received
extensive renovation and remodeling, tying it in to the new addition.  The 
project was completed in July of 1983.  In April, 1985, the Bank opened the
first automated drive-up in Downeast Maine.  The automated teller machine
is adjacent to its drive-up facility located at 66 Main Street, in Ellsworth,
Maine.  In October, 1985, our new branch in Somesville, Maine opened.  The 
site is a high traffic area and holds excellent promise for  attracting new 
accounts and servicing existing ones.  In 1988, the Main Office began 
construction of an addition to its existing building that would house loan 
operations.  In September, 1989, construction was completed on the addition.
In May, 1992, the bank opened a trust office in Bangor (Penobscot County) to 
serve trust customers in that city and surrounding areas.  In May 1995, the 
Bank elected not to renew its lease for its Bangor office.  In addition, the 
Bank owns the following properties:

         (a)     The Bank's Cherryfield office located on Church Street in  
                 Cherryfield, Maine.  A major renovation was undertaken at
                 Cherryfield in 1983, approximately doubling its size. 
                 These alterations were completed in January of 1984.

         (b)     The Bank's Jonesport office located on Main Street in
                 Jonesport, Maine.

         (c)     The Bank's Blue Hill office located on Main Street in Blue
                 Hill, Maine.During 1989, the branch was renovated to
                 include an office for the Assistant Manager.

         (d)     The Bank's Stonington office located on Atlantic Avenue in
                 Stonington, Maine. The Stonington office was renovated and
                 expanded in 1980. 

         (e)     The Bank's Milbridge office located on Main Street in
                 Milbridge, Maine. In 1987, management decided to replace
                 the Milbridge Branch with a larger up-to-date facility,
                 located at the same site.  The new branch is now 
                 completed and has been open for business since April 1988.

         (f)     The Bank purchased in 1989 a parcel of land located on
                 Route 3 in Ellsworth with the possible intention of
                 constructing a new branch.  There are no plans for 
                 construction at this time.

All of the Bank's offices include drive-up facilities.

leases the following properties:

         (a)     The bank leases its branch office at the Ellsworth Shopping
                 Center, High Street Ellsworth, Maine, from Ellsworth 
                 Shopping Center, Inc., a Maine Corporation with principal
                 offices in Ellsworth, Maine.  The current lease will expire
                 in May of 1997. 

         (b)     The Bank leases its Machias office which is located on
                 Dublin Street in Machias, Maine.  The premises are owned by
                 Hannaford Bros., Inc. of South Portland, Maine, and are
                 leased to Gay's Super Markets, Inc., under a lease dated
                 July 26, 1975.  The Bank subleased the premises from Gay's
                 Super Markets, Inc., under a sublease which expires in      
                 April of 1996.  The bank has the right to extend the
                 sublease for three additional five year terms.

         (c)     The Bank leases its Somesville Branch Office which is

                 premises are owned by A.C. Fernald Sons, Inc., Mount
                 Desert, Maine.  The current lease expires on March 24,

In May, 1995, the Audit Committee of the Company voted to engage Berry,
Dunn, McNeil & Parker as independent auditors of the Company.  The Company's 
former auditors, Baker, Newman & Noyes (which was the successor firm as of 
1/2/95 to the Portland, Maine office of KPMG Peat Marwick) was dismissed on 
the same date.  Each of the auditors' report on the financial statements for 
the past two fiscal years did not contain an adverse opinion or disclaimer of 
opinion and were not qualified as to uncertainty, audit scope or accounting 
principles.  In connection with the audits of the two most recent fiscal 
years preceeding the change in accountants, there were no disagreements of 
any type with the Company's former auditor on any matter of accounting 
principles or practices, financial statement disclosure or auditing scope or 
procedure.  During the Company's two fiscal years preceeding the change in 
accountants, no reportable event which would require disclosure under federal 
securities laws, occured.

The Board of Directors and Shareholders
Union Bankshares Company

We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheet of Union
Bankshares Company and Subsidiary as of December 31, 1995, and the related
consolidated statements of income, changes in shareholders' equity and cash
flows for the year then ended.  These consolidated financial statements are
the responsibility of the Company's management.  Our responsibility is to
express an opinion on these financial statements based on our audit.  The
financial statements of Union Bankshares Company and Subsidiary as of and
for the year ended December 31, 1994 were audited by other auditors whose
report thereon dated January 20, 1995, included an explanatory paragraph
that described the Company's change in its method of accounting for
investments to adopt the provisions of the Financial Accounting Standards
Board's Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 115,
Accounting for Certain Investments in Debt and Equity Securities at January
1, 1994, as discussed Notes 3 and 4 to the financial statements.  The
financial statements of Union Bankshares Company and Subsidiary as of and
for the year ended December 31, 1993 were audited by other auditors whose
report thereon dated January 13, 1994, included an explanatory paragraph
that described the Company's adoption of SFAS No. 106, Employers' Accounting

of accounting for income taxes in 1993 to adopt provisions of SFAS No. 109,
Accounting for Income Taxes on January 1, 1993, as discussed in Note 10 to
the financial statements.

We have conducted our audit in accordance with generally accepted auditing
standards.  Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to
obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free
of material misstatement.  An audit includes examining, on a test basis,
evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. 
An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and
significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall
financial statement presentation.  We believe our audit provides a
reasonable basis for our opinion.

In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present fairly,
in all material respects, the consolidated financial position of Union
Bankshares Company and Subsidiary as of December 31, 1995, and the
consolidated results of their operations and their consolidated cash flows
for the year then ended, in conformity with generally accepted accounting

February 16, 1996






Dear Shareholder:

      While 1995 was a satisfactory year in some
respects for your Bank, it was disappointing in
others.  Earnings reached an all time high of
$2,418,057 or $12.78 per share, a modest increase of
2.7 percent over the previous year. A rapid decrease
in interest rates on the lending side and inability to
offset such decreases as quickly in our cost of funds
contributed to a general squeeze in our interest rate
margins.  Consequently, our earnings did not increase
as much as originally planned.  Also, noninterest
expenses increased, due largely to wages, and costs
associated with new product development, both of which
unfortunately stunted the gains which otherwise would
have been achieved through lower Federal Deposit
Insurance Premiums.  Steps being taken to correct this
situation are discussed elsewhere in this letter.

      On a more positive note, we call your attention
to various ratios of performance.  Your Bank continued
to earn 1.3 percent on average assets and 11.4 percent
on average capital.  Capital ratios also remained
strong.  At year end, capital was a record 13.7
percent of deposits and 11.9 percent of total assets.

      Despite a slow economy, a strong sales and new
business development effort by lenders, branch
managers and customer service personnel produced solid
gains in both loans and deposits.  Loans increased by
10.7 percent to $93,242,760, while deposits grew by a
more modest 3.2 percent to $165,357,869.

      During the year, after careful thought, the
Board of Directors decided to employ John Floyd
Associates, banking consultants and specialists in
bank operations, to study all the Bank s operations
and the manner in which our products and services are
sold, processed, and delivered to our customers.  We
expect this study will help us achieve operational
efficiencies and cost savings going forward, resulting
in a positive impact both on our ability to more
effectively compete in our market place and on our net
operating profits.

      In April, the Board voted to declare a stock
dividend of 33 1/3 percent which was paid in May and<PAGE>


the cash dividend in accordance with past practice was
maintained at $4.00 per share per year.  This was the
fourth such increase in the past 10 years and
represents an increase in dividends paid of 2.77 times
that paid in 1985.

      During the year, the following promotions and
appointments were made:
                        
        Dawn L. Lacerda     Operations Officer
        Teresa L. Linscott  Electronic Service  
                            Officer
        Gayle A. Norton     Assistant Vice President,
                            Human Resources
        Marsha L. Osgood    Assistant Trust Officer
        Deborah F. Preble   Assistant Controller
        Stephen L. Tobey    Assistant Vice President,
                            Operations and Security
        Julie C. Vittum     Senior Auditor

     We note with sorrow the passing of two Honorary
Directors, J. Roy Barrette, Director for 31 years and
David J. Kennedy, who served 38 years; and Sharon R.
Carter, teller at our Machias branch for 9 1/2 years,
to whom this report is dedicated.

     In September, Richard W. Teele, Executive Vice
President and Treasurer, elected to retire after 18
years of service.  Dick made many contributions to the
Bank and while his daily presence will be missed, we
are pleased that he will remain as a Director and
Secretary of the Corporation.

     Two new Directors were named during 1995:  Peter
Clapp, President, Blue Hill Garage and Paul L. Tracy,
President/Owner, Winter Harbor Agency and Vice
President, Schoodic Insurance Services.

     On April 1, 1996, Robert S. Boit, having reached
mandatory retirement age, will step down as President
and Chief Executive Officer.  Having served the Bank
for 23 years, Mr. Boit will remain as a Director on
both the General Board and the Executive Board.  In
February, the Board elected Peter A. Blyberg,
currently Executive Vice President, to the position of
President and Chief Executive Officer, to take effect
on April 1, 1996.  Mr. Blyberg joined the Bank in 1993
having been with Chemical Bank of New York for 18
years.

     The economy is more likely to grow at a slow pace
for the balance of 1996, and we expect eastern Maine
to be no exception.  Despite all the talk about
potential reforms in government spending, deficit
reductions and alterations in the tax code, experience
indicates that any changes will be less dramatic than
current expectations suggest.

     We extend our sincerest thanks to you, our
Shareholders, and our Directors, Officers and
Employees for your support.


Sincerely,


                            
John V. Sawyer, II                                 Robert S. Boit

MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF
FINANCIAL CONDITIONS AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS
December 31, 1995


     Union Bankshares Company is a one-bank holding
company, organized under the laws of the State of
Maine, which has acquired 99.928% of the common stock
of Union Trust Company.  The Company's only subsidiary
is the Bank.  The Company's holding company structure
can be utilized to engage in permitted banking-related
activities, either directly or through newly formed
subsidiaries, or by acquiring companies already
established in such activities.  The Company has no
immediate plans for such activities, but could do so
if such action should appear desirable.

     Union Trust is a full-service, independent
commercial bank with ten offices in coastal Maine,
serving the financial needs of individuals,
businesses, and municipalities in Hancock and
Washington Counties.  With its commitment to
outstanding service, quality products and the ability
to anticipate and respond to the customers' financial
needs, Union Trust, now in its 108th year, is proud to
have earned the reputation as one of New England's
preeminent community banks.

     Union Trust supports the people and communities
it serves and believes that reinvesting local money
locally builds strong communities.  The Bank's
charitable contribution program supports a broad range
of local charities, community development efforts and
the volunteerism of its employees and retirees.

     Union Trust Company offers a full range of
banking services, at competitive rates and at
convenient banking hours and locations and is
accessible to customers 24 hours a day through
physical locations and electronic means.  This year
the Bank introduced BankLine which provides 24-hour
access by phone, whereby customers may check the
balance of their accounts, check recent account
activity, verify interest paid and earned, transfer
funds between accounts and make loan payments.

     Union Trust's deposit services include: regular
and basic checking accounts, NOW accounts, money
market accounts, savings accounts, certificate of
deposits, IRA accounts, KEOGH Plans, ATM Convenience
Cards, Convenience Check Cards, reserve checking,
credit cards, BankLine, Unlimited Club membership and
safe deposit boxes.  The Bank also provides the
following loan services: installment loans, student
loans, mortgages, lines of credit, commercial loans,
home equity loans and Visa credit cards.

     Union Trust Company also offers a full range of

                           9<PAGE>


investment and trust services.  Our professional trust
advisors design and administer personal trusts,
individual retirement accounts, self-employed
retirement accounts, company retirement plans
(pension, simplified employee pension, 401(k), profit
sharing), and estate plans.  In addition, our trust
staff will help people of all ages and income levels
analyze their savings and retirement needs and plan
customized investment strategies to meet the
customer's goal.  In 1995, the Trust Department
introduced MutualPARTNERS, an asset allocation program
that offers a balanced investment mechanism for our
customers.  Using mutual funds and creating portfolios
designed to meet each person's individual situation
and risk level, the Bank hopes to appeal to a broad
range of potential trust customers, many of whom might
otherwise think that they don't have enough savings to
qualify for a trust.

RESULTS OF OPERATIONS
     The operating results of the Bank depend
primarily on its net interest
income, which is the difference between interest
income on earning assets (which consists primarily of
loans and investments) and interest expense (which
consist primarily of deposits and borrowings).  The
Bank's results are also affected by the Provision For
Loan Losses, which reflects management's assessment of
the adequacy of the Allowance For Loan Losses;
noninterest income, including gains and losses on the
sales of loans and securities; noninterest expenses;
and income tax expense.  Each of these major
components of the Bank's operating results are
highlighted below.

NET INCOME
     Net income in 1995 of $2,418,057 increased from
1994 by $64,094 or 2.7%.  Net income in 1994
represented an increase of $220,326 or 10.3% from
1993.

     The following table summarizes the status of the
Bank's earnings and performance for the periods
stated.

available for sale securities of $567,810 and
($1,389,168) at December 31, 1995 and 1994,
respectively.

     In 1995, the Company declared a 33 1/3 percent
stock dividend, and therefore earnings and cash
dividends per share have been retroactively restated
for 1994 and 1993 to reflect the stock dividend.

NET INTEREST INCOME
     Net interest income continues to be the most
significant determinant of the Company's earning
performance.  The management of interest rate risk has
become increasingly important to ensure the continued
profitability of the Bank.  Interest rate risk results
from volatile interest rates, increased competition
and changes in the regulatory environment.  The Bank's
exposure to interest rate movements is controlled by a
careful balancing of interest earned and interest paid
as well as the maturities of assets and liabilities.

     Net interest income in 1995 was $8,803,241, an
increase of $312,848 or 3.7% from 1994.  The increase
was primarily due to higher loan levels in 1995, up
$9,034,924 on December 31, 1995 or 10.7% over December
31, 1994.  Loans generally represent higher yielding
assets than securities.

     Loan increases were primarily the result of a
loan calling program instituted in late 1995 and a
recovering local economy.  Interest and fees earned on
loans in 1995 amounted to $8,800,000, up $1,300,000 or
17.1% over the year ended December 31, 1994.  Variable
rate loans amounting to $54,000,000 represent
approximately 58.0% of the total loan portfolio. 
Despite falling interest rates, loan yields improved
by 34 basis points in 1995 compared to the 1994
increase of 89 basis points.  Moderate balance
increases were experienced in real estate, commercial,
municipal and consumer categories, and the loan mix
remains consistent with prior years.

     Interest expense on deposits in 1995 increased
20.5% or $856,185 from 1994.  The increase was
primarily due to a change in the Bank's deposit mix to
higher costing deposits, which reflected the
customer's desire to invest more in high-yielding


                          11<PAGE>


certificates of deposit.  In 1994, interest expense on
deposits decreased 11.5% or $541,355 from 1993.
     
     Interest margin, the percentage difference
between interest earned on loans and investments and
interest paid to depositors, declined 23 basis points
in 1995 over 1994. Your Bank's net interest margin is
among the highest of all Maine banks. The Bank
continues to monitor short- and long-term interest
rates, balance sheet volumes and maturities in order
to optimize its net interest margin.

     The following table illustrates the Bank's net
interest margin for the years indicated:

                                            December 31,

                                  1995            1994           1993

Yield on earning assets          8.330%          8.042%         7.328%
Cost of all funds                3.104%          2.586%         2.539%
Net interest margin              5.226%          5.456%         4.789%


PROVISION FOR LOAN LOSSES
     The provision for loan losses increased by
$30,000 in 1995.  This increase was due to increased
loan volume and the desire to maintain the Allowance
for Loan Losses at 2.0% of gross loans.  There was no
provision made in 1994 and a $30,000 increase in 1993.

     The process of evaluating the adequacy of the
Allowance for Loan Losses involves a high degree of
management judgement.  Such judgement is based, in
part, on systematic methods.  These methods include a
loan-by-loan analysis of all larger commercial loans
and commercial real estate loans as well as those that
were nonperforming or were being closely monitored by
management for potential problems, and a quantitative
analysis of residential real estate and consumer
loans.  The analysis also incorporates all relevant
matters that affect loan collectibility.  Based on
this analysis, an estimation of potential loss
exposure was made and an allowance determined.  

     Management believes that the Allowance for Loan
Losses and the carrying value of real estate owned are
adequate.  While management uses available information
to recognize losses on loans and real estate owned,
future additions to the allowances may be necessary
based on changes in economic conditions, particularly
in northern New England.  In addition, various
regulatory agencies, as an integral part of their
examination process, periodically review the Company's
Allowance for Loan Losses.  Such agencies may require
the Company to recognize additions to the allowance
based on their judgements about information available


                          12<PAGE>


to them at the time of their examination.

     The following table reflects the quality of the
Bank's loan portfolio and the emphasis placed upon the
management of credit risk:

NONINTEREST INCOME
     The Company receives noninterest income from
trust fees, service charges on deposit accounts and
income comprised of fees earned from a variety of
other banking services.  Security gains or losses are
another major component of this category.

     Noninterest income, excluding securities gains,
remained relatively stable for the years 1995 and
1994.  In 1993, an increase of $92,525, or 4.9% was
experienced.  The primary reason for the change in
1995 was a $75,927 or 21.4% increase in Visa income,
offset by a decrease of $81,802 or 20.2% of Loan
Department income.

     Major efforts were made in 1995 to increase Visa
accounts in conjunction with the loan calling program. 
The decrease in Loan Department income in 1995 is
primarily a result of a major slowdown in the volume
of residential mortgages.  This slowdown impacted the
volume of processed loans sold to the secondary market
in both 1994 and 1995. Origination of loans held for
sale were $8,593,440, $10,813,150, and $18,846,144 for
1995, 1994, and 1993, respectively.

     Trust Department income increased $43,352, or
10.8% in 1995 compared with $12,722 or 3.1% decrease
in 1994.  The increase is primarily a result of new
business in 1995 and an improved stock market.

     Net security gains amounted to $3,103, $98,009


                          13<PAGE>


and $266,664 for the years 1995, 1994, and 1993,
respectively.

NONINTEREST EXPENSE
     Noninterest expense consists of employee
compensation and benefits, occupancy and equipment
expenses and other general operating expenses.

     In an effort to enhance the Bank's management
process and operating procedures and to improve
efficiencies, the Bank, in the fall of 1995, employed
the services of John M. Floyd and Associates, Inc., of
Bellaire, Texas.  As a result of the work done with
this firm, we expect to achieve more efficient use of
resources, increased income opportunities, improved
delivery of products and services and reduced expense. 
Management anticipates implementation of many of the
study's recommendations in 1996 and 1997.

     Noninterest expenses increased .53% to $7,459,206
in 1995 and 5.5% in 1994. The increases in 1995 were
centered primarily in salaries and wages, advertising
new product development and supplies. These increases
were offset, to some extent, by decreases in pension
and employee benefits, as well as an FDIC insurance
premium rebate and rate reduction, which occurred
during the year.

     Salaries and wages increased 5.7% in 1995, down
from a 10.2% increase in 1994 over 1993.

     Pension and employee benefits (current and post-
retirement) decreased 11.5% in 1995 following a 24.2%
increase in 1994 due to the implementation of deferred
compensation agreements.  The periodic post-retirement
benefit costs under Statement of Financial Accounting
Standards (SFAS) No. 106, "Employers' Accounting for
Post-Retirement Benefits Other Than Pension" were
$148,646, $154,800 and $148,700 for 1995, 1994, and
1993, respectively.  Future changes in the discount
rates applied to the actuarial analysis will have a
corresponding impact on the Company's pension and
post-retirement liabilities.

INCOME TAXES
     The status of the Bank's income tax expense is as
follows:


                            Twelve Months Ended December 31,

            Tax Expense                      Percentage of Pre-tax Earnings

                          14 <PAGE>
 


     Statement of Financial Accounting Standards
(SFAS) No. 109, "Accounting for Income Taxes", was
adopted by the Company in 1993 and resulted in a
positive cumulative effect of $68,000 to net income. 
The Bank has sufficient refundable taxes paid in
available carry-back years to fully realize its
recorded deferred tax asset of $1,072,636 at December
31, 1995.

SHAREHOLDERS' EQUITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES
     The Federal Reserve Board's capital requirements
generally call for an 8% total capital ratio, of which
4% must be comprised of Tier 1 capital.  Risk-based
capital ratios are calculated by weighing assets and
off-balance sheet instruments according to their
relative credit risks.  The Company's Tier 1 capital
ratio of 20.4% far exceeds the Federal Reserve Board's
guidelines.



     Total shareholders' equity increased $3,613,113
in 1995 primarily as a result of net income of
$2,418,057, as well as a $1,956,978 change in the
category of "Unrealized Gains (Losses)on Securities
Available for Sale", net of applicable income taxes,
from the adoption of Statement of Financial Accounting
Standards (SFAS) No. 115, "Accounting for Certain
Investments on Debt and Equity Securities."

     Dividends of $756,860 were declared on the
Company's common stock and represented a 24.8%
increase over 1994.  Dividend payout for 1995, 1994,
and 1993 was 31.3%, 25.8%, and 28.4% of net income,
respectively.  In 1995, the Company declared a 33 1/3
percent stock dividend.

LIQUIDITY MANAGEMENT
     Liquidity management is the process by which the
Bank structures its cash flow to meet requirements of
its customers as well as day-to-day operating
expenses.

     Liquidity is provided from both assets and
liabilities.  The asset side of the balance sheet
provides liquidity through the regular maturities on
our securities portfolio, as well as the interest
received on these assets.  In addition, U.S.
Government securities may be readily converted to cash
by sale in the open market.  On the liability side,
liquidity comes from deposit growth and the Bank's
accessibility to other sources of borrowed funds.  In
this respect, liquidity is enhanced by a significant
amount of core demand and savings deposits from a
broad customer base.

     As a part of the Bank's asset and liability
management and liquidity needs, management actively

                          15<PAGE>


evaluates its funding resource and strategies to
reduce and manage the vulnerability of its operation
to changes in interest rates.

     When a Company's ability to reprice interest-
bearing liabilities exceeds its ability to reprice
interest-earning assets within shorter time periods,
material and prolonged increases in interest rates
generally adversely affect net interest income, while
material and prolonged decreases in interest rates
generally have the opposite effect.

     A principal objective of the Company is to reduce
and manage the vulnerability of its operations to
changes in interest rates by managing the ratio of
interest-rate sensitive assets to interest-rate
sensitive liabilities within specified maturities or
repricing dates.

     Union Trust Company is asset-sensitive as a
result of its variable-rate loan portfolio and its
short-term investment portfolio. Bank earnings may be
negatively affected, should interest rates fall.

     As of December 31, 1995, the Bank's ratio of
rate-sensitive assets to rate-sensitive liabilities at
the one-year horizon was 95%, its one-year GAP
(measurement of interest sensitivity of interest-
earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities at a
point in time) was -3%, and $82,000,000 in assets and
$75,000,000 in liabilities will be repricable in one
year.

     In addition to the "traditional" GAP calculation,
the Company analyzes future net interest income based
on budget projections including anticipated business
activity, anticipated changes in interest rates and
other variables, which are adjusted periodically by
management to take into account current economic
conditions, the current interest rate environment, and
other factors.

     The following table presents, as of December 31,
1995, the Company's interest rate GAP analysis:

The status of the Bank's sources of cash to fund its
operation are as follows:

BALANCE SHEET ANALYSIS
     Total assets increased $9,800,000 or 5.4%, in
1995, primarily due to increased loan volume, compared
to a decrease of approximately $530,000 or .3%, in
1994.  The following table gives a general overview
and profile of the Company:

sale securities with cost of $70,939,000 and
$76,000,000 for 1995 and 1994, respectively.

** Excluding net unrealized gains (losses) on
available for sale securities of $567,810 and
($1,389,168) at December 31, 1995 and 1994,
respectively.

SECURITIES
     The objective of the securities portfolio is to
provide for a stable earnings base and the investment
of excess liquidity.  The carrying value of the
portfolio at December 31, 1995, totaled $76,000,000,
consisting primarily of U.S. Government and Agency
Securities.  Approximately 46% of the securities
portfolio matures in the one-through-five-year period.

     The Company has reviewed its investment policy
regarding securities. In recognition of current


                          19<PAGE>


economic conditions and the attendant responsibility
of management to consider known liquidity requirements
and provide for capital planning, investment
securities may be sold as part of prudent
asset/liability management.  Accordingly, the Bank has
classified certain securities (exclusive of tax-free
securities) to assets available for sale.  Therefore,
such assets are recorded at market value.

     As a result of Statement of Financial Accounting
Standards Board Statement (SFAS) No. 115, "Accounting
for Certain Investments in Debt and Equity
Securities,"  unrealized holding gains or losses, net
of tax effect, for securities classified as available
for sale are recorded as an adjustment of a separate
component of equity.

LOANS
     Total loans increased $9,035,000, or 10.7%,
primarily due to a $3,499,000, or 6.5%, increase in
real estate loans, and a $3,242,000, or 77.4%,
increase in municipal loans.

     On January 1, 1995, the Company adopted Financial
Accounting Standards Board Statement No. 114,
"Accounting by Creditors for Impairment of a Loan",
which states that a loan is defined as "impaired" when
it is probable that the creditor will be unable to
collect all amounts due, including principal and
interest, under the contracted terms of the loan.

     Loans that are reported on nonaccrual, overdue,
rated or watch listings are tested for impairment. 
Management then determines, loan-by-loan based upon
the credit history and repayment schedule, whether the
loan is impaired or, in all probability, uncollectible
by the Bank.  Adoption of this standard has had no
effect on the level of Allowance for Loan Losses in
1995.

DEPOSITS
     Total deposits increased $5,109,000, or 3.2%,
during 1995, primarily due to competitive interest
rates on products offered and as a result of the
calling program instituted this year.  Total deposits
decreased .6%, or $987,000, in 1994.

     The banking business, in the Bank's market area,
is somewhat seasonal due to an influx of tourists and
summer residents each spring and summer.  As a result,
the Bank has an annual deposit swing from a high point
in mid-October, to a low point in May.  This deposit
swing is predictable and does not have a materially
adverse effect on the Bank.

IMPACT OF INFLATION AND CHANGING PRICES
     The Consolidated Financial Statements and related
notes presented in this Annual Report have been

                          20<PAGE>


prepared in accordance with generally accepted
accounting principles, which require the measurement
of financial position and operating results in terms
of historical dollars without considering changes in
the relative purchasing power of money over time due
to inflation.

     Unlike many industrial companies, substantially
all of the assets and virtually all of the liabilities
of the Company are monetary in nature.  As a result,
interest rates have a more significant impact on the
Company's performance than the general level of
inflation.  Over short periods of time, interest rates
may not necessarily move in the same direction or in
the same magnitude as inflation.

     Union Bankshares, $25 par value, is not listed on
any national exchange, nor is it actively traded.
Since the Company is not aware of all trades, the
market price is established by determining what a
willing buyer will pay a willing seller.  Based upon
the trades that the Company had knowledge of (per
quotes from Paine, Webber, Inc., and other local
brokerages), high and low bids for each quarter for
1995 and 1994 are listed in the following table:


         1st Quarter       2nd Quarter         3rd Quarter      4th Quarter    
1995 $160.00 to $175.00 $125.00 to $169.26 $150.00 to $167.00 $167.00 to $170.00

1994 $155.00 to $160.00 $160.00 to $160.00 $160.00 to $160.00 $160.00 to $160.00


     As of December 31, 1995, there were 654 holders
of record of Union Trust Company common stock.

     Quarterly dividends paid by the Company in 1995
and 1994 were as follows:

                                                  1995            1994

                           1st Quarter            $1.00           $.81

                           4th Quarter            $1.00           $.81
                           Total                  $4.00          $3.21 


RECENT ACCOUNTING DEVELOPMENTS
     In March 1995, the Financial Accounting Standards
Board issued Statement of Financial Accounting
Standards (SFAS) No. 121, "Accounting for the
Impairment of Long-Lived Assets and for Long-Lived
Assets to be Disposed of," effective for financial


                          21<PAGE>


statements for fiscal years beginning after December
15, 1995.  SFAS No. 121 requires that long-lived
assets and certain identifiable intangibles be held
and used by an entity being reviewed for impairment
whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate
that the carrying amount for an asset may not be
recoverable.  The Company expects no material impact
from adopting SFAS No. 121.

     In May, 1995, the Financial Accounting Standards
Board issued Statement of Financial Accounting
Standards (SFAS) No. 122, "Accounting for Mortgage
Servicing Rights" (an amendment of FASB Statement No.
65).  SFAS No. 122 applies to mortgage banking
activities in which a mortgage loan is originated, or
purchased, and then sold with the right to service the
loan retained by the mortgage banking entity.  The
Statement amends SFAS No. 65, which provided only for
the recognition of purchased mortgage servicing
rights.  Prior to SFAS No. 122, purchased mortgage
servicing rights were capitalized only in
circumstances where the right to service loans was
acquired from another organization.  SFAS No. 122
amends SFAS No. 65 by requiring the capitalization of
mortgage servicing rights, whether they were acquired
from another organization or originated internally. 
Additionally, SFAS No. 122 has provisions that require
an impairment analysis of the servicing right
regardless of whether the servicing right was
originated or purchased.  The Company has not
determined the impact of adopting SFAS No. 122.

     In October, 1995, the Financial Accounting
Standards Board issued Statement of Financial
Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 123, "Accounting for
Stock-based Compensation," effective for financial
statements for the fiscal year beginning after
December 15, 1995.  SFAS No. 123, requires entities to
disclose the fair value of their stock options,
although they will not have to record the options at
fair value in the financial statement.  As of December
31, 1995, the Company did not offer stock-based
compensation to its employees.

UNION BANKSHARES COMPANY AND SUBSIDIARY
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
December 31, 1995 and 1994


1. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES
Business
       Union Bankshares Company provides a full range
of banking services to  individual and corporate
customers through its subsidiary and branches in
Maine. The Company is subject to competition from
other financial institutions. The Company is subject
to regulations of certain Federal agencies and
undergoes periodic examinations by those regulatory
authorities.

Basis of Consolidated Financial Statement Presentation
       The consolidated financial statements have been
prepared in conformity with generally accepted
accounting principles. In preparing the consolidated
financial statements, management is required to make
estimates and assumptions that affect the reported
amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of
continuing assets and liabilities as of the date of
the balance sheet and revenues and expenses for the
period. Actual results could differ significantly from
those estimates.

Principles of Consolidation
       The accompanying consolidated financial
statements include the accounts of the Company and its
majority-owned subsidiary, Union Trust Company. All
significant intercompany balances and transactions
have been eliminated in the accompanying financial
statements. Minority interests, which are not
significant, are included in other liabilities in the
balance sheets and other operating expenses in the
consolidated statements of income. 

Earnings and Cash Dividends Per Share
       Earnings per share is based upon the average
number of common shares outstanding during each year.
In 1995, the Company declared a 33-1/3 percent stock
dividend. Earnings and cash dividends per share have
been retroactively restated for 1994 and 1993 to
reflect the stock dividend.

Investments
       The Company adopted Statement of Financial
Accounting Standards No. 115, "Accounting for Certain
Investments in Debt and Equity Securities," effective
January 1, 1994. The adoption resulted in the
reclassification of certain investment securities as
of January 1, 1994. The scope of the Statement did not
encompass loans. The Company s investment accounting
policies are as follows: 



                          36<PAGE>



Trading Account Securities
       Trading account securities, consisting of
securities purchased with the intent that they will be
subsequently sold to provide net securities gains, are
carried at market value. Realized and unrealized gains
and losses on trading account securities are
recognized in the consolidated statements of income as
they occur. There were no trading securities at
December 31, 1995 and 1994.

volunteers and photo of Michelle Joy, Accounting Clerk
and Jayne Wallace, Branch Supervisor at our Somesville
Branch.

Available for Sale Securities
       Available for sale securities consist of debt
securities that the Company anticipates could be made
available for sale in response to changes in market
interest rates, liquidity needs, changes in funding
sources and other similar factors. These assets are
specifically identified and are carried at fair value.
Amortization of premiums and accretion of discounts
are recorded as an adjustment to yield.  Unrealized
holding gains and losses for these assets, net of
related income taxes, are excluded from earnings and
are reported as a net amount in a separate component
of Shareholders  equity. When decline in market value
is considered other than temporary, the loss is
recognized in the consolidated statements of income,
resulting in the establishment of a new cost basis for
the security.

Held to Maturity Securities
       Held to maturity securities consist of
purchased debt securities that the Company has the
positive intent and ability to hold until maturity.
Debt securities classified as held to maturity are
carried at amortized cost, adjusted for amortization
of premiums and accretion of discounts. When decline
in market value is considered other than temporary,
the loss is recognized in the consolidated statements
of income, resulting in the establishment of a new
cost basis for the security.

Other Investment Securities
       Other investment securities consist of Federal
Home Loan Bank (FHLB) stock and Federal Reserve Bank
stock.  These securities are carried at cost, which
approximates market at December 31, 1995 and 1994.

Manager of Cherryfield Branch

Loans Held for Sale 
       Loans held for sale are loans originated for
the purpose of potential subsequent sale. These loans

                          37<PAGE>


are carried at lower of cost or market at December 31,
1995 and 1994. Gains and losses on the sale of these
loans are computed on the basis of specific
identification.
       
Loan Servicing
       Mortgage loans serviced for others are not
included in the accompanying balance sheet.  The Bank
recognizes a loan servicing fee for the difference
between the principal and interest payment collected
on the loan and the payment remitted to the investor. 
In May 1995, the Financial Accounting Standards Board
issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards
(SFAS) No. 122, "Accounting for Mortgage Servicing
Rights," which requires capitalization of mortgage
servicing rights for loans originated after January 1,
1996.
       
Premises, Furniture and Equipment
       Premises, furniture and equipment are stated at
cost less accumulated depreciation. Depreciation
expense is computed by accelerated and straight-line
methods over the estimated useful life of each type of
asset. Leasehold improvements are amortized over the
terms of the respective leases or the service lives of
the improvements. Maintenance and repairs are charged
to expense as incurred; betterments are capitalized.

Allowance for Loan Losses
       The Allowance for Loan Losses is established by
management to absorb charge-offs of loans deemed
uncollectible. This allowance is increased by
provisions charged to operating expense and by
recoveries on loans previously charged-off. The amount
of the provision is based on management s evaluation
of the loan portfolio. Considerations in this
evaluation include past and anticipated loan loss
experience, the character and size of the loan
portfolio and maintenance of the allowance at a level
adequate to absorb anticipated future losses.

       Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No.
114, "Accounting by Creditor for Impairment of a
Loan," was adopted on January 1, 1995.  Under this
standard, loans considered to be impaired are reduced
to the present value of expected future cash flows or
to the fair value of collateral, by allocating a
portion of the Allowance for Loan Losses to such
loans.  If these allocations cause the Allowance for
Loan Losses to increase, such increase is reported as
loan loss provision.  There was no effect on the
financial statement in adopting this standard for
1995.

Other Real Estate Owned
       Other real estate owned, which is included in
other assets, is recorded at the lower of cost or fair
value less estimated costs to sell at the time the

                          38<PAGE>


Company takes possession of the property. Losses
arising from the acquisition of such properties are
charged against the Allowance for Loan Losses.
Operating expenses and any subsequent provisions to
reduce the carrying value are charged to operations.
Gains and losses upon disposition are reflected in
earnings as realized.

Accounting Estimates
       Material estimates that are particularly
susceptible to significant change in the future relate
to the determination of the Allowance for Loan Losses.
In connection with the determination of the Allowance
for Loan Losses and the carrying value of real estate
owned, management obtains independent appraisals for
significant properties.

       Management believes that the allowance for
losses on loans and the carrying value of real estate
owned are adequate. While management uses available
information to recognize losses on loans and real
estate owned, future additions to the allowances may
be necessary based on changes in economic conditions,
particularly in northern New England. In addition,
various regulatory agencies, as an integral part of
their examination process, periodically review the
Company s Allowance for Loan Losses. Such agencies may
require the Company to recognize additions to the
allowances based on their judgments about information
available to them at the time of their examination.

Income Taxes
       The Bank accounts for income taxes in
accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting
Standards No.109, "Accounting for Income Taxes." 
Under the asset and liability method of Statement 109,
deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for
the future tax consequences attributable to
differences between the financial statement carrying
amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their
respective tax bases. Deferred tax assets and
liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates
expected to apply to taxable income in the years in
which those temporary differences are expected to be
recovered or settled. Under Statement 109, the effect
on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in
tax rates is recognized in income in the period that
includes the enactment date.

       Effective January 1, 1993, the Company adopted
Statement 109 and has reported the cumulative effect
of that change in the method of accounting for income
taxes in the 1993 consolidated statements of income.

Accrual of Interest Income and Expense
       Interest on loans and investment securities is
taken into income using methods that relate the income
earned to the balances of loans outstanding and

                          39<PAGE>


investment securities. Interest expense on liabilities
is derived by applying applicable interest rates to
principal amounts outstanding. The recording of
interest income on problem loan accounts ceases when
collectibility within a reasonable period of time
becomes doubtful. Interest income accruals are resumed
only when they are brought fully current with respect
to principal and interest and when management expects
the loan to be fully collectible.

       The carrying values of impaired loans are
periodically adjusted to reflect cash payments,
revised estimates of future cash flows and increases
in the present value of expected cash flows due to the
passage of time.  Cash payments representing interest
income are reported as such.  Other cash payments are
reported as reductions in carrying value, while
increases or decreases due to changes in estimates of
future payments and due to the passage of time are
reflected in the loan loss provision.

Loan Origination Fees and Costs
       Loan origination fees and certain direct loan
origination costs are recognized over the life of the
related loan as an adjustment to or reduction of the
loan s yield. 

Statement of Cash Flows
       For purposes of reporting cash flows, cash and
cash equivalents include cash on hand, amounts due
from banks and Federal funds sold. Generally, Federal
funds are purchased and sold for one-day periods.

Fair Value Estimates
       The Company has made fair value estimates on
its financial instruments. Fair value estimates are
made at a specific point in time, based on relevant
market information and information about the financial
instrument. These estimates do not reflect any premium
or discount that could result from offering for sale
at one time the Company s entire holdings of a
particular financial instrument. Because no market
exists for a significant portion of the Company s
financial instruments, fair value estimates are based
on judgments regarding future expected loss
experience, current economic conditions, risk
characteristics of various financial instruments and
other factors. These estimates are subjective in
nature and involve uncertainties and matters of
significant judgment and therefore cannot be
determined with precision. Changes in assumptions
could significantly affect the estimates.

2. CASH AND DUE FROM BANK ACCOUNTS
       The Federal Reserve Board requires the Bank to
maintain a reserve balance. The amount of this reserve
balance as of December 31, 1995 was $100,000.


                          40<PAGE>


3. HELD TO MATURITY SECURITIES
       The carrying amounts of held to maturity
securities for 1995 and 1994 as shown in the
consolidated balance sheets of the Company, and their
approximate market values at December 31, are as

                                                               securities as of
                                  1995               1994      December 31, 1995

5. LOANS
       At December 31, 1995 and 1994, loans on
nonaccrual status totaled approximately $614,000 and
$151,000, respectively. If interest had been accrued
on such loans, interest income on loans would have
been approximately $28,000, $17,000 and $52,000 higher
in 1995, 1994, and 1993, respectively. Loans
delinquent by 90 days or more that were still on
accrual status at December 31, 1995 and 1994 totaled
approximately $388,000 and $86,000, respectively.

       In the ordinary course of business, the
Company s subsidiary granted loans to the Executive
Officers and Directors of the Company and its
subsidiary, and to affiliates of Directors. Such loans
were made on substantially the same terms, including
interest rates and collateral, as those prevailing at
the time for comparable transactions with other
persons and did not involve more than normal risk of
collectibility.

       The balance of loans to related parties
amounted to $1,388,780 and $1,163,540 at December 31,
1995 and 1994, respectively. New loans granted to
related parties in 1995 totaled approximately
$532,567; payments and reductions amounted to

8.  LEASE AND RENTAL EXPENSE
       At December 31, 1995, the Bank was obligated
under a number of noncancellable leases for premises
and equipment which are accounted for as operating
leases.  Leases for real property contain original


                          44<PAGE>


terms from 2 to 20 years with renewal options up to 20
years.  Management expects that in the normal course
of business, most leases will be renewed or replaced
by other leases, or when available, purchase options
may be exercised.

       Rental expense was $83,068 in 1995, $90,175 in
1994, and $78,212 in 1993.

       The minimum annual lease commitments under
noncancellable leases in effect at December 31, 1995,
are as follows:


                         Year Ending December 31,          Amount

10.  Employee Benefits
PENSION PLAN
       The Company's subsidiary has a noncontributory
defined benefit pension plan covering substantially
all permanent full-time employees.  The benefits are
based on  employees' years of service and the average
of their three highest consecutive rates of annual
salary preceding retirement.

       It is the subsidiary's policy to fund the plan
sufficiently to meet the minimum funding requirements
set forth in the Employee Retirement Income Security
Act of 1974, plus such additional amounts as the
Company may determine to be appropriate from time to
time.

       Pension expense amounted to $126,219, $124,720
and $94,641 for the years ended December 31, 1995,
1994 and 1993, respectively.

       The weighted average discount rates of 7.0% and
8.0% were used in determining the projected benefit in
1995 and 1994, respectively. The increase in salary
levels was 5.0%. Expected long-term rates of return on


                          46 <PAGE>
 


assets were 8.0% for 1995, 1994, and 1993,
respectively.

Post-retirement Benefits Other Than Pensions
       The Company sponsors a post-retirement benefit
program that provides medical coverage and life
insurance benefits to certain employees and directors
who meet minimum age and service requirements. Active
employees and directors accrue benefits over a 25-year
period.

       Effective January 1, 1993, the Company adopted
Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 106,
"Employers  Accounting for Post-retirement Benefits
Other Than Pensions." Statement 106 requires the
Company to change from the cash basis of accounting
for post-retirement benefits, which recognizes costs
when paid, to the accrual method, which recognizes
costs over the employee s period of active employment.
Statement 106 may be adopted through a 20-year
transition or by recognizing the entire accumulated
post-retirement benefit obligation immediately. The
Company decided to amortize the total post-retirement
benefit obligation of $915,000 over a 20-year period
beginning January 1, 1993. The effect of adopting
Statement 106 was a decrease in net income and an
increase of the net periodic benefit cost for the
years ended December 31, 1995 and 1994 in the amount
of $148,646 and $154,800, respectively.

       The following table sets forth the status of
the Company s post-retirement obligation at December
31, 1995 and 1994:

       For measurement purposes, the assumed annual
rates of increase in the per capita cost of covered
benefits were 15% and 14% for 1995 and 1994,
respectively. Per capita medical costs are assumed to
decrease annually by 1% until the year 2002 and later,
which at that time will be 6%. The health care cost
trend rate assumption has a significant effect on the
amounts reported; however, these amounts are not
available at this time. The weighted average discount
rate and rate of compensation increase used in
determining the accumulated post-retirement benefit
obligation were 8.5% and 6.0%, respectively, on
December 31, 1995 and 1994.

401(K) PLAN
       The Company has a 401(k) noncontributory plan
for employees who meet certain service requirements.

11.  INCOME TAXES

       Deferred tax expense (benefits) results from
timing differences in the recognition of revenue and
expense for tax and financial statement purposes. The
sources of these differences and the tax effect of
each are as follows:

       Income tax expense amounted to $885,263 for
1995 (an effective rate of 28.0%), $796,736 for 1994
(an effective rate of 25.3%) and $797,000 for 1993 (an
effective rate of 27.8%). The actual tax expense for
1995, 1994 and 1993 differs from the "expected" tax
expense for those years (computed by applying the
applicable U.S. Federal Corporate Tax Rate to income
before income taxes) due to the following:

       The Bank has sufficient refundable taxes paid
in available carry-back years to fully realize its
recorded deferred tax asset of $1,072,636 at December
31, 1995. The deferred tax asset and liability are
included in other assets and other liabilities on the
balance sheet at December 31, 1995 and 1994, except
for the amount attributed to available for sale
securities, which is included in Shareholder's equity.

12. SHAREHOLDERS  EQUITY
       The Federal Reserve Board has issued guidelines
for a risk-based approach to measuring the capital
adequacy of bank holding companies and state-chartered
banks that are members of the Federal Reserve System.
These capital requirements generally call for an 8%
total capital ratio, of which 4% must be comprised of
Tier I capital. Risk-based capital ratios are
calculated by weighing assets and off-balance sheet
instruments according to their relative credit risks.
At December 31, 1995, the Company had met the minimum
capital ratios.

13. FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS WITH OFF-BALANCE SHEET RISK
AND CONCENTRATIONS OF CREDIT RISK
       In the normal course of business, the Bank is a
party to financial instruments with off-balance sheet
risk to meet the financing needs of its customers.
These financial instruments include commitments to
extend credit and letters of credit. The instruments


                          50<PAGE>


involve, to varying degrees, elements of credit risk
in excess of the amount recognized in the statement of
financial position. The contract amounts of these
instruments reflect the extent of involvement the Bank
has in particular classes of financial instruments. At
December 31, 1995 and 1994, the following financial
instruments, whose contract amounts represent credit
risk, were outstanding:


                                                      Contract Amount

                                                    1995            1994
    Commitments to extend credit                $30,987,000     $27,911,000
    Standby letters of credit                   $    36,000     $   127,000
    Unadvanced portions of construction loans   $   809,000     $   459,000


       The Bank s exposure to credit loss in the event
of nonperformance by the other party to the above
financial instruments is represented by the
contractual amounts of the instruments. The Bank uses
the same credit policies in making commitments and
conditional obligations as it does for on-balance
sheet instruments.

       Commitments to extend credit are agreements to
lend to a customer as long as there is no violation of
any condition established in the contract. Commitments
generally have fixed expiration dates or other
termination clauses and may require payment of a fee.
Since many of the commitments are expected to expire
without being drawn upon, the total commitment amounts
do not necessarily represent future cash requirements.
The Bank evaluates each customer s creditworthiness on
a case-by-case basis. The amount of collateral
obtained, if deemed necessary by the Bank upon the
credit extension, is based on management s credit
evaluation of the counterparty. Collateral held varies
but may include residential and commercial real estate
and, to a lesser degree, personal property, business
inventory and accounts receivable.

       Standby letters of credit are conditional
commitments issued by the Bank to guarantee the
performance of a customer to a third party. The credit
risk involved in issuing letters of credit is
essentially the same as that involved in extending
loan facilities to customers.

       The Bank grants residential, commercial and
consumer loans to customers principally located in
Hancock and Washington Counties of the State of Maine.
Although the loan portfolio is diversified, a
substantial portion of its debtors  ability to honor
their contracts is dependent upon the economic
conditions in the area, especially in the real estate


                          51<PAGE>


sector. There were no borrowers whose total
indebtedness to the Bank exceeded 10% of the Bank s
Shareholders  equity at December 31, 1995.

       The consolidated balance sheets do not include
various contingent liabilities such as liabilities for
assets held in trust. Management does not anticipate
any loss as a result of these contingencies.


14. FAIR VALUE OF FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS
       Statement of Accounting Standards No. 107,
"Disclosures About Fair Value of Financial
Instruments," requires that the Bank disclose
estimated fair values for its financial instruments.
Fair value estimates, methods and assumptions are set
forth below for the Bank s financial instruments.
Statement 107 specifies that fair values should be
calculated based on the value of one unit without
regard to any premium or discount that may result from
concentrations of ownership of a financial instrument,
possible tax ramifications or estimated transaction
costs. If these considerations had been incorporated
into the fair value estimates, the aggregate fair
value amount could have changed.

Cash, Due from Banks and Federal Funds Sold
       The fair value of cash, due from banks and
Federal funds soldapproximates their relative book
values at December 31, 1995 and 1994, as these
financial instruments have short maturities.

Available for Sale Securities and Held to Maturity
Securities
       Fair values are estimated based on bid prices
published in financial newspapers or bid quotations
received from securities dealers. The fair value of
certain state and municipal securities is not readily
available through market sources other than dealer
quotations, so fair value estimates are based on
quoted market prices of similar instruments, adjusted
for differences between the quoted instruments and the
instruments being valued.

Loans
       Fair values are estimated for portfolios of
loans with similar financial characteristics.
Management has determined that the fair value
approximates book value on all loans with maturities
of one year or less and variable interest rates. The
fair values of all other loans are estimated based on
bid quotations received from securities dealers. The
estimates of maturity are based on the Bank s
historical experience with repayments for each loan
classification, modified, as required, by an estimate
of the effect of current economic, lending conditions
and the effects of estimated prepayments.


                          52<PAGE>


Loans Held for Sale
       The fair market value of this financial
instrument approximates the book value as this
financial instrument has a short maturity.

Accrued Interest Receivable
       The fair market value of this financial
instrument approximates the book value as this
financial instrument has a short maturity. It is the
Bank s policy to stop accruing interest on loans past
due by more than ninety days.

Other Investment Securities, Federal Home Loan Bank
Stock and Federal Reserve Bank Stock
       The fair market value of these financial
instruments approximates the book value as these
financial instruments do not have a market nor is it
practical to estimate their fair value without
incurring excessive costs.

Deposits
       Under Statement 107, the fair value of deposits
with no stated maturity, such as noninterest-bearing
demand deposits, savings, NOW accounts and money
market and checking accounts, is equal to the amount
payable on demand. The fair values of certificates of
deposit are based on the discounted value of
contractual cash flows. The discount rate is estimated
using the rates currently offered for deposits of
similar remaining maturities.

       The fair value estimates do not include the
benefit that results from the low-cost funding
provided by the deposit liabilities compared to the
cost of borrowing funds in the market. If that value
was considered, the fair value of the Bank s net
assets could increase.

Accrued Interest Payable
       The fair value of this financial instrument
approximates the book value as this financial
instrument has a short maturity.

       Insert photo of John Lynch, Senior Vice
President Loans

Commitment to Extend Credit
       Under Statement 107, the fair value of
commitments to extend credit is estimated using the
fees currently charged to enter into similar
agreements, taking into account the remaining terms of
the agreements and the present creditworthiness of the
counterparties. The Bank has not estimated the fair
values of commitments to originate loans due to their
short-term nature and their relative immateriality.




                          53<PAGE>



Limitations
       Fair value estimates are made at a specific
point in time, based on relevant market information
and information about the financial instruments. These
values do not reflect any premium or discount that
could result from offering for sale at one time the
Bank s entire holdings of a particular financial
instrument. Because no market exists for a significant
portion of the Bank s financial instruments, fair
value estimates are based on judgments regarding
future expected loss experience, current economic
conditions, risk characteristics of various financial
instruments and other factors. These estimates are
subjective in nature and involve uncertainties and
matters of significant judgment and therefore cannot
be determined with precision. Changes in assumptions
could significantly affect the estimates.

       Fair value estimates are based on existing on-
and off-balance sheet financial instruments without
attempting to estimate the value of anticipated future
business and the value of assets and liabilities that
are not considered financial instruments. Other
significant assets and liabilities that are not
considered financial instruments include the deferred
tax assets, bank premises and equipment and other real
estate owned. In addition, the tax ramifications
related to the realization of the unrealized gains and
losses can have a significant effect on fair value
estimates and have not been considered in any of the
estimates.

             INDEPENDENT AUDITORS' REPORT

The Board of Directors and Shareholders
Union Bankshares Company

We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance
sheet of Union Bankshares Company and Subsidiary as of
December 31, 1995, and the related consolidated
statements of income, changes in shareholders' equity
and cash flows for the year then ended.  These
consolidated financial statements are the
responsibility of the Company's management.  Our
responsibility is to express an opinion on these
financial statements based on our audit.  The
financial statements of Union Bankshares Company and
Subsidiary as of and for the year ended December 31,
1994 were audited by other auditors whose report
thereon dated January 20, 1995, included an
explanatory paragraph that described the Company's
change in its method of accounting for investments to
adopt the provisions of the Financial Accounting
Standards Board's Statement of Financial Accounting
Standards (SFAS) No. 115, Accounting for Certain
Investments in Debt and Equity Securities at January
1, 1994, as discussed in Notes 3 and 4 to the
financial statements.  The financial statements of
Union Bankshares Company and Subsidiary as of and for
the year ended December 31, 1993 were audited by other
auditors whose report thereon dated January 13, 1994,
included an explanatory paragraph that described the
Company's adoption of SFAS No. 106, Employers'
Accounting for Post Retirement Benefits Other Than
Pensions in 1993, as discussed in Note 9 to the
financial statements, and the Company's change in its
method of accounting for income taxes in 1993 to adopt
provisions of SFAS No. 109, Accounting for Income
Taxes on January 1, 1993, as discussed in Note 10 to
the financial statements.

We conducted our audit in accordance with generally
accepted auditing standards.  Those standards require
that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
reasonable assurance about whether the financial
statements are free of material misstatement.  An
audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence
supporting the amounts and disclosures in the
financial statements.  An audit also includes
assessing the accounting principles used and
significant estimates made by management, as well as
evaluating the overall financial statement
presentation.  We believe our audit provides a
reasonable basis for our opinion.

In our opinion, the financial statements referred to
above present fairly, in all material respects, the
consolidated financial position of Union Bankshares
Company and Subsidiary as of December 31, 1995, and
the consolidated results of their operations and their

                          57<PAGE>


consolidated cash flows for the year then ended, in
conformity with generally accepted accounting
principles.
