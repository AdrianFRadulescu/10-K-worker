ITEM 1. BUSINESS.
 
OVERVIEW
 
     The Company, the successor to a corporation founded in 1896, is a
U.S.-based independent (non-integrated) oil and gas company with worldwide
operations. At December 31, 1995, the Company had proved oil and gas reserves of
435 million barrels of oil equivalent. All of the Company's oil and gas
producing activities are currently conducted outside of the United States,
primarily in Indonesia, the United Kingdom (the "U.K.") sector of the North Sea
and Pakistan. The Company also owns an interest in a U.S.-based petrochemical
business.
 
     Unless the context otherwise requires, all references herein to the Company
are not intended to imply exact corporate relationships and include Union Texas
Petroleum Holdings, Inc., its predecessors and its subsidiaries, including their
interests in certain partnerships. Union Texas Petroleum Holdings, Inc. was
organized under the laws of the State of Delaware in 1982. The address and
telephone number of the Company's principal executive offices are 1330 Post Oak
Blvd., Houston, Texas 77056, (713) 623-6544. As of February 29, 1996, the
Company had approximately 1,100 full-time employees worldwide.
 
     The Company's principal current international activities began in the late
1960s with its participation in a joint venture in Indonesia and in two
consortia in the U.K. North Sea. In addition, the Company is currently engaged
in exploration and production activities in several other countries.
International oil and gas properties accounted for 100% of the Company's total
proved reserves as of December 31, 1995. A significant portion of the Company's
net income attributable to its oil and gas operations in recent periods
(excluding the gain on the sales of the Company's U.S. businesses made in 1991)
has been generated by its international operations.
 
     The Company's Indonesian activities consist primarily of its 37.81% working
interest in a joint venture that produces natural gas and, to a lesser extent,
oil and condensate from several fields in East Kalimantan, Indonesia. The
Company holds its interests in this joint venture directly through a wholly
owned subsidiary and also indirectly through its 50% interest in Unimar Company
("Unimar"), which is a partnership with a subsidiary of LASMO plc, a U.K.
company. Unimar owns ENSTAR Corporation and its subsidiaries, including Virginia
Indonesia Company, the operator of the joint venture. The Company's interests in
Unimar are reported on its Consolidated Financial Statements as an equity
investment (the "Equity Partnership"). See Notes 5 and 17 of Notes to
Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding the
Equity Partnership.
 
     Natural gas produced by the East Kalimantan joint venture is converted into
liquefied natural gas ("LNG") at facilities owned by Pertamina, the Indonesian
national oil company. Currently, LNG is principally sold to two groups of
Japanese industrial and utility customers, the national oil company of the
Republic of China, a consortium of buyers organized by Osaka Gas, and Korea Gas
Corporation, under long-term contracts originally signed in 1973, 1981, 1987,
1990 and 1991, respectively. In 1995, Pertamina extended its 1973 and 1981
long-term LNG sales contracts and signed agreements for two new long-term LNG
sales contracts. To supply the additional quantities of LNG called for primarily
by the 1973 contract extension, Pertamina is currently constructing a seventh
processing train at the Bontang LNG facility, the financing of which was
completed during 1995. The construction of the seventh train began in 1995, and
completion is expected in late 1997. Negotiations are also currently underway
for the construction of an eighth train to support the new sales contracts. The
Company is also participating in exploration activities of the East Kalimantan
joint venture, as well as exploration activities independent of that joint
venture in other parts of Indonesia.
 
     The Company's principal properties in the North Sea are interests in the
Piper, Claymore, Saltire, Chanter, Scapa and Alba oil fields, the Sean gas
fields and the Britannia gas and condensate field. The Company owns a 20%
working interest in the Piper, Claymore, Saltire, Chanter and Scapa oil fields,
which are operated by Elf Enterprise Caledonia Limited and a 25% working
interest in the North, South and East Sean gas fields, which are operated by
Shell U.K. Limited. In 1995, the Company acquired a 15.5% working interest
 
                                        1
<PAGE>   4
 
in Block 16/26, which includes the Alba field, for approximately $270 million.
The Alba field commenced production in 1994 and is operated by Chevron U.K.
Limited. As of December 31, 1995, the Company had recorded approximately 43
million barrels of oil as proved reserves for the Alba field. In 1994, the
Company also acquired a 9.42% unit interest in the Britannia gas field, a
portion of which underlies the Alba field, for approximately $159 million. The
Britannia field is operated by Britannia Operator Limited, a joint venture
between Conoco (U.K.) Limited and Chevron U.K. Limited. As of December 31, 1995,
the Company had recorded 46 million barrels of oil equivalent of proved
undeveloped reserves for the Britannia field. Production from the Britannia
field is expected to begin in late 1998.
 
     Since 1977, the Company has participated through joint ventures in oil and
gas exploration, development and production in the Badin area in Pakistan. Oil
production from the Badin area began in 1982, and gas production began in 1989.
The Company is the operator of the Pakistan joint ventures with working
interests of either 30% or 25.5% in the currently producing fields. In 1995, the
Company signed a concession agreement for the Eastern Sindh block in
southeastern Pakistan, which covers approximately 1.8 million acres. The
Company, as operator, holds a 70% working interest in the concession.
 
     The Company participates worldwide in exploration for oil and gas in both
new venture areas and the Company's producing areas. Current worldwide activity
includes interests in Alaska, Tunisia, Italy, Ireland and Argentina, as well as
the U.K., Pakistan and Indonesia.
 
     In the United States, the Company operates the Geismar ethylene plant in
which it owns a 41.67% interest. Located near Baton Rouge, Louisiana, the
Geismar plant, which has a 1.25 billion annual gross pounds capacity (521
million net), processes gas liquids feedstocks to produce ethylene for sale to
several petrochemical manufacturers for the production of plastics used in
various consumer products.
 
     In January 1996, the Board of Directors of the Company approved a $220
million capital expenditure budget for 1996. Approximately $152 million has been
budgeted for oil and gas development projects in the U.K. North Sea, Indonesia
and Pakistan, including $60 million for the continued development of the
Britannia field and $16 million for development activities at the Alba field.
The Company has also budgeted approximately $21 million for exploration projects
in the U.K. North Sea, Pakistan and Indonesia, $18 million for activities in
Alaska, including the Western Colville area on the North Slope, and $16 million
in new venture exploration activities primarily in Tunisia, Italy, Ireland and
Argentina. The Company has also budgeted approximately $10 million for its U.S.
petrochemical interests. Acquisition costs are not included in the capital
expenditure budget. See Item 7 -- Management's Discussion and Analysis of
Financial Condition and Results of Operation.

(a)  Net income (loss) and identifiable assets do not give effect to general and
     administrative items. See Note 13 of Notes to Consolidated Financial
     Statements for additional data.
 
(b)  Includes assumed U.S. taxes at regular statutory tax rates. The Company,
     however, was subject to the U.S. corporate alternative minimum tax.
 
     As reflected in the preceding table, a significant portion of the Company's
income was generated from its overseas operations, particularly its
participation in the producing fields in the East Kalimantan area of Indonesia
and in the U.K. North Sea. The Company's overseas operations are subject to
certain risks, including expropriation of assets, governmental reinterpretation
of applicable laws and contract terms, increases in taxes and government
royalties, renegotiation of contracts with foreign governments or customers,
foreign government approvals of lease, permit or similar applications and of
exploration and development plans, political and economic instability, disputes
between governments, payment delays, export restrictions, limits on allowable
levels of exploration and production and currency shortages, exchange losses and
repatriation restrictions, as well as changes in laws and policies governing
operations of companies with overseas operations, including more strict
environmental regulation. In addition, in the event of a dispute arising from
foreign operations, the Company may be subject to the exclusive jurisdiction of
foreign courts or may not be successful in subjecting foreign persons to the
jurisdiction of courts in the U.S. The Company may
 
                                        3

also be hindered or prevented from enforcing its rights with respect to a
governmental instrumentality because of the doctrine of sovereign immunity.
Foreign operations and investments may also be subject to laws and policies of
the U.S. affecting foreign trade, investment and taxation that could affect the
conduct and profitability of those operations. See "Current Markets for Oil and
Gas" below and Item 7 -- Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial
Condition and Results of Operations.
 
     All of the Company's oil and gas activities are subject to the risks
usually associated with exploration for, and development and production of, oil
and gas, including blowouts, cratering, oil spills, fires and adverse or
seasonal weather conditions. Offshore operations are also subject to marine
perils and extensive governmental regulations, as well as interruption or
termination by governmental authorities based on environmental or other
considerations. The Company's petrochemical operations are subject to certain
additional risks, including the breakdown or failure of equipment, the
performance of equipment at levels below those originally projected, and
explosions, fires, floods and other catastrophic events. The occurrence of any
of these events could cause injury to life or property, interruptions in
operations or increases in the costs of operations. As is customary in the oil
and gas and petrochemical industries, the Company reviews its safety equipment
and procedures and carries insurance against some, but not all, of these risks.
In particular, the Company's environmental insurance and pollution coverage
contain certain limitations in coverage. Losses and liabilities arising from
such events would reduce revenues and increase costs to the Company to the
extent not covered by insurance. See "Other Matters" below.

(c) Information regarding Indonesian reserves relates to the Company's net
    interest in a production sharing contract between the Indonesian joint
    venture and Pertamina. The joint venture has no ownership interest in the
    reserves but does have the right to share revenues and production and is
    entitled to recover most field and other operating costs and capital
    depreciation. The reserve estimates, which are based on year-end prices, are
    subject to revision as product prices and costs fluctuate due to the cost
    recovery feature under the production sharing contract. The impact on
    reserves is inversely related to price changes and directly related to
    changes in field operating and capital costs. In addition, reserve estimates
    are subject to revision due to the effect that price fluctuations generally
    have on estimates of recoverable reserves. Debt relating to the LNG
    processing facilities owned by Pertamina is serviced from proceeds of LNG
    sales prior to the distribution of such proceeds primarily to the members of
    the joint venture, Pertamina and the other production sharing contractors.
    The debt obligation is not the obligation of the joint venture. Debt service
    relating to such facilities is accounted for in the Company's reserve
    estimates as a cost of production and operation. Such debt service is
    deducted in estimating future net revenues to be distributed among Pertamina
    and the production sharing contractors, including the joint venture and the
    Company's interest therein. See "International Exploration and
    Production -- Indonesia" below and Note 17 of Notes to Consolidated
    Financial Statements.
 
     There are numerous uncertainties inherent in estimating quantities of
reserves and in projecting future rates of production and timing of development
expenditures, including many factors beyond the control of the producer. The
reserve data set forth in this Annual Report on Form 10-K represent only
estimates. Reserve engineering is a subjective process of estimating underground
accumulations of oil and gas that cannot be measured in an exact way, and the
accuracy of any reserve estimate is a function of the quality and quantity of
available data and of engineering and geological interpretation and judgment. As
a result, estimates of different engineers often vary. In addition, results of
drilling, testing and production subsequent to the date of an estimate may
justify revision of such estimate. Accordingly, reserve estimates at a specific
point in time are often different from the quantities of oil and gas that are
ultimately recovered, which differences may be significant. Additionally, the
estimates of future net revenues from proved reserves of the Company and the
present value of future net revenues are based upon certain assumptions about
future production levels, prices and costs that may not prove correct over time.
The meaningfulness of such estimates is highly dependent upon the accuracy of
the assumptions upon which they were based. See "Current Markets for Oil and
Gas" below.
 
     In general, the Company's volume of production from oil and gas properties
declines with the passage of time. In addition, the Company's and its
co-venturers' participation share of gas volumes supplied to support Indonesian
LNG sales contract extensions or additions will be significantly less than their
participation share under the original long-term sales contracts. Except to the
extent the Company acquires additional properties containing proved reserves or
conducts successful exploration or development activities, or both, the proved
reserves of the Company, and the revenues generated from production thereof
(assuming no price increases), will decline as reserves are produced. Drilling
activities are expensive and subject to numerous risks, including the risk that
no commercially viable oil or gas production will be obtained. Increases or
decreases in prices of oil and gas and in cost levels, along with the timing of
development projects, will also affect revenues generated by the Company and the
present value of estimated future net cash flows from its properties. Revenues
generated from future activities of the Company are highly dependent upon the
level of success in acquiring, finding or developing additional reserves. See
Notes 1 and 17 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.
 
     The Company's reserve and production replacement strategy combines
exploitation, development drilling in proven areas and focused worldwide
exploration activities. The Company also continues to evaluate acquisitions to
add proved developed and undeveloped reserves with upside potential. The
Company's future oil and natural gas production is highly dependent on its level
of success in these activities, and there can be no assurance that such
activities will result in additional reserves and production. For a discussion
of the Company's production, see "International Exploration and Production"
below.

CURRENT MARKETS FOR OIL AND GAS
 
     Revenues generated from the Company's operations are highly dependent upon
the prices of and demand for oil and gas. The unsettled energy market makes it
difficult to estimate future prices and sales volumes of natural gas and crude
oil. Prices received by the Company for its oil and gas production are affected
by a number of factors beyond the control of the Company, including worldwide
supplies of oil and gas, changing international economic and political
conditions, contract enforceability, insolvency of other parties, domestic and
foreign energy legislation, weather, environmental conditions, regulations and
events, and actions of major petroleum producers including members of the
Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries. The Company cannot predict
whether oil or gas prices will remain at, or increase or decline from, current
levels. If oil prices decline, the price for a significant portion of the
natural gas produced from the Company's properties, including the sales price
for LNG, will also decline.
 
ACREAGE
 
     The following table summarizes the Company's developed and undeveloped
acreage at December 31, 1995, by geographic area. As used herein and in

INTERNATIONAL EXPLORATION AND PRODUCTION
 
  Indonesia
 
     The Company is engaged in oil and gas exploration, development and
production in Indonesia, primarily through a joint venture group it joined in
1969. Under a production sharing contract with Pertamina, the
 
                                        8
<PAGE>   11
 
Indonesian national oil company, which currently covers approximately 1.1
million acres, the joint venture produces gas and, to a lesser extent, oil and
condensate, in the East Kalimantan area. Substantially all of the natural gas
produced by the joint venture is supplied, pursuant to long-term contracts with
Pertamina, to a liquefaction plant owned by Pertamina at Bontang Bay,
approximately 35 miles from the production areas. At the Bontang plant, gas is
converted into LNG in parallel processing units ("trains") by reducing the
temperature of the gas to approximately minus 161 degrees Celsius. The Bontang
plant currently has six trains in operation, and construction of the seventh
train by Pertamina is scheduled for completion in late 1997. Negotiations are
currently underway for an eighth train, the construction of which is expected to
begin in late 1997 or 1998. After conversion, the LNG is pumped into specially
designed tankers (owned by third parties) and transported to purchasers in the
Pacific Rim, where it is returned to its original gaseous form and used for fuel
by electric utilities and industry. The Bontang plant also processes LPG.
 
     Production Sharing Contract and Drilling. The joint venture's production
sharing contract with Pertamina grants the joint venture the right to share in
the production and revenues from the contract area, but not ownership rights in
the oil and gas reserves. The joint venture's contract area in East Kalimantan
includes substantial portions of two fields, Badak and Nilam, as well as several
other fields. The joint venture has relinquished 20% of the area covered by the
production sharing contract since 1990 when the contract was extended and is
required to relinquish the following additional amounts of the area covered by
the contract: 10% by August 7, 1998, 10% by December 31, 2000, 15% by December
31, 2002, and 15% by December 31, 2004. The joint venture, however, is not
obligated to relinquish any area from which oil or natural gas is produced.
 
     The production sharing contract originally expired in 1998, but in 1990,
Pertamina and the joint venture amended the production sharing contract and
extended the joint venture's right to explore, develop and produce oil and gas
in the contract area until 2018 through a second production sharing contract,
containing terms and conditions generally similar to the amended production
sharing contract. References herein to the production sharing contract mean the
production sharing contract in effect for the applicable time period. The
production sharing contract entitles the joint venture participants to recover
most field and other operating costs, as well as capital depreciation, and to
receive, net of Indonesian taxes, 35% of the remaining gas production until
August 1998, and 25% or 30%, depending upon the applicable sales contract, with
some exceptions, of such production for the remaining term of the contract. The
production sharing contract also entitles the joint venture participants to take
their respective shares of oil and condensate production in kind, and after
recovering operating expenses and capital depreciation, to retain 15% of the
proceeds from sales of such production, net of Indonesian taxes. Proceeds from
the sale of oil and condensate (except for that sold pursuant to the joint
venture's domestic market obligation) are currently based on official Indonesian
crude oil prices and reflect world market prices.
 
     The Company owns a 37.81% working interest in the joint venture (26.25%
directly and 11.56% through subsidiaries of Unimar, the Equity Partnership). The
Company's 11.56% indirect interest is subject to the right of holders of
Unimar's Indonesian Participating Units ("IPUs") to receive a percentage of
certain cash flow resulting from Unimar's interest in the joint venture until
September 25, 1999, at which time the IPUs will expire with no residual value to
the holder. In 1995, approximately one-fourth of the Company's interest in such
cash flow of Unimar was burdened by such payment obligation. Virginia Indonesia
Company, a participant in the joint venture and a subsidiary of Unimar, acts as
operator of the joint venture. The vote of participants holding 66 2/3% of the
total joint venture ownership interest is generally required for approval of
significant matters pertaining to the joint venture.
 
     At December 31, 1995, proved reserves (net) attributable to the Company's
total interest in the joint venture were approximately 1.3 Tcf of gas and 27
MMBbls of oil and condensate. The reserve estimates, which are based on year-end
prices, for the Company's net interest in the production sharing contract are
subject to revision as product prices and costs fluctuate due to the cost
recovery feature under the contract. The impact on reserves is inversely related
to price changes and directly related to changes in field operating and capital
costs. In addition, reserves are subject to revision due to the effect that
price fluctuations generally have on estimates of recoverable reserves. See Note
17 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.
 
                                        9
<PAGE>   12
 
     Substantially all of the joint venture's natural gas production and
reserves are committed to several long-term supply agreements with Pertamina,
which obligate the joint venture to supply certain minimum quantities of natural
gas. The Company believes that there are adequate reserves in the joint
venture's production sharing contract area to supply natural gas under the joint
venture's contractual commitments outstanding as of December 31, 1995. Pertamina
continues to make progress in marketing additional LNG volumes. The percentage
of the natural gas supplied by the joint venture in support of future LNG or LPG
sales contracts, or renewals or extensions of existing long-term sales
contracts, is dependent primarily upon the uncommitted reserves of natural gas
that the joint venture has in its production sharing contract area at the time
that Pertamina establishes the allocation of the natural gas supply for such
sales contracts among the various contractor groups in the East Kalimantan area.
Because a substantial portion of the joint venture's reserves of natural gas has
been committed to support existing LNG sales contracts, the Company expects that
absent the discovery of significant additional natural gas reserves in the joint
venture's contract area, the joint venture's participation in future new sales
contracts for LNG and LPG, or in extensions or renewals of existing long-term
contracts, will be less than its current participation in existing contracts.
 
     In 1995 and 1994, 16 and 23 successful development wells, respectively,
were drilled in fields in East Kalimantan. During 1996, the Company expects to
spend approximately $37 million on development projects. The joint venture also
continues to evaluate the East Kalimantan area to identify additional gas
prospects. All of these expenditures will be cost recoverable pursuant to the
production sharing contract.
 
     The joint venture participants are required collectively to sell
approximately 8.5% of the total oil and condensate production from most existing
fields in the contract area at $0.20 per barrel for domestic Indonesian
consumption. The domestic market obligation is suspended, however, for the first
60 months of production from new fields in the contract area, after which the
price will be 10% of the realized Indonesian export price. These obligations are
factored into the Company's net reserves estimates. Each participant's remaining
oil and condensate production is generally sold in world oil markets. In
addition to the oil and condensate sold for domestic use, the joint venture
supplies gas for domestic consumption, and the amount supplied for such purposes
may increase or decrease in the future. Profits from gas supplied for domestic
consumption, which was sold at an average price of $1.07 per Mcf in 1995, are
less than from gas supplied for LNG. Gas supplied for domestic consumption
constituted less than 6% of the joint venture's gas production during 1995.
 
     Bontang Plant. At the Bontang plant, natural gas supplied by the joint
venture and other production sharing contractors is converted to LNG and shipped
in LNG tankers ("cargoes"). These specially designed tankers vary in size and
the term "cargo" as used herein means 125,000 cubic meters of LNG. In 1995 and
1994, deliveries from the plant were 240 gross cargoes and 247 gross cargoes of
LNG, respectively. During 1993, the completion of the debottlenecking project on
the first four trains and the completion of the sixth train increased the
production capacity of the Bontang plant to approximately 275 gross cargoes per
year. The Bontang plant currently has additional unused processing capacity;
however, sales of LNG starting in 1998 under recently finalized sales contracts
will begin to use this excess capacity. See "Sales Contracts" below for more
information.
 
     The amount of revenue that the Company receives as a result of the
production of natural gas in support of the sale of LNG by Pertamina is
dependent upon the number of cargoes shipped each year, the Company's ultimate
participation in each cargo, the price the buyers must pay for the LNG purchased
and the costs to be recovered from the proceeds of sales of LNG.
 
     The Bontang plant's ability to manufacture and ship quantities of LNG is
dependent upon the continued operation of the Bontang plant without mechanical
failure and without the shutdown of any processing units in excess of scheduled
maintenance periods. The sale of LNG is also dependent upon the availability of
shipping without interruption and upon the continued operation of the buyers'
receiving terminals. The manufacture, shipment, receipt and distribution of LNG
can be interrupted or adversely impacted by severe weather, acts of nature or
other events. The costs associated with transportation of LNG, such as repair
and maintenance or replacement of LNG tankers, are beyond the control of the
Company.
 
                                       10
<PAGE>   13
 
     The Bontang plant is owned by Pertamina and operated on a
cost-reimbursement basis by a corporation owned in part by the joint venture.
The financing of the original two trains was repaid in 1990, and the financing
for the second two trains was repaid in 1993. Financing for construction of the
fifth train at the Bontang plant was provided principally from Japanese sources
through a funding arrangement under which debt service is paid by the Trustee
(as defined below) to the lenders from the proceeds of LNG sales, primarily
under the contract signed in 1987 with Chinese Petroleum Corporation ("CPC"),
the national oil company of the Republic of China (Taiwan). Final repayment is
scheduled in 2000. In 1991, Pertamina arranged $750 million under a similar
financing arrangement for the construction of the sixth train and associated
facilities at the Bontang plant. Construction began in 1991 and was completed in
late 1993 at a cost of approximately $700 million. Repayment began in 1994 from
proceeds of the Osaka contract (as defined below), and final repayment is
scheduled in 2004. In July 1995, a $969.5 million financing was completed for
the seventh train, third dock, LPG expansion and other support facilities. The
financing was provided from Japanese sources through arrangements similar to
those used to finance the Bontang plant's fifth and sixth trains. Repayment is
scheduled to begin in 1998 principally from the proceeds of the short-term LNG
sales contracts with CPC and Korea Gas Corporation ("KGC") and starting in 2000,
from the proceeds of the extension of the 1973 contract. The construction of the
seventh train began in 1995 and is currently scheduled for completion in late
1997. Financings of the fifth, sixth and seventh trains are nonrecourse to both
Pertamina and the joint venture.
 
     Sales Contracts. The joint venture currently has gas supply agreements with
Pertamina that support the long-term and short-term LNG sales contracts and
obligate the joint venture to provide certain quantities of natural gas for
fulfillment of Pertamina's obligations pursuant to the LNG sales contracts. The
supply agreements terminate concurrently with the expirations of their
respective LNG sales contracts. The extent of the joint venture's obligation to
supply natural gas in support of Pertamina's LNG sales contracts and its right
to receive revenues attributable to the sale of LNG under such contracts vary
among the sales contracts. In 1995 and 1994, 99 Bcf and 108 Bcf, respectively,
net to the Company, were delivered to Pertamina under these supply agreements.
1996 is expected to represent a peak year for production for the joint venture.
 
     LNG is currently sold by Pertamina to two groups of Japanese industrial and
utility customers and to CPC under long-term contracts signed in 1973, 1981 and
1987, respectively. Additionally, sales of LNG began in November 1994 under a
long-term contract signed in 1990 with a consortium of buyers organized by Osaka
Gas, a Japanese utility (the "Osaka contract"). LNG is also sold by Pertamina
under additional long-term contracts with KGC signed in 1983 and 1991 (the
"Korean Carryover" and "Korea II" contracts, respectively) and beginning in
1996, under the long-term Mid-Cities Gas Companies ("MCGC") contract signed in
1992. Some of the added capacity from the expansion of the LNG facilities during
1993 is also used to supply LNG sold under short-term contracts to Japanese,
Korean and Taiwanese buyers. The sales price under the LNG sales contracts is
tied to an average of prices for exported Indonesian crude oil.
 
     In 1995, Pertamina finalized agreements to extend the LNG contracts
originally signed in 1973 and 1981 until 2010 and 2011, respectively. Pertamina
also signed agreements for two new long-term LNG sales contracts with CPC (Badak
VI) and KGC (Badak V), which provide for LNG sales from 1998 until 2017. To
support the supply of the additional quantities of LNG required primarily by the
1973 extended contract, Pertamina is currently constructing the seventh train.
In addition, Pertamina, the joint venture and the other production sharing
contract groups are currently planning the development, financing and
construction of an eighth train, which is anticipated to begin construction in
late 1997 or 1998, primarily to support the supply of quantities of LNG required
by the new CPC and KGC long-term contracts. The construction of the eighth
train, and accordingly the new CPC and KGC sales contracts in support thereof,
are subject to Indonesian governmental approval.
 
     The Company's right to receive revenues from the sale of LNG and LPG under
any future new contracts or extensions or renewals of existing contracts,
including the 1973 and 1981 contract extensions and the new CPC and KGC
long-term contracts, is affected by the allocation of the gas supply obligation
in support of such contracts among the joint venture and the other production
sharing contractors supplying gas to the Bontang plant. This allocation is set
by Pertamina and is primarily based upon uncommitted reserves of natural gas
available at the time Pertamina makes the allocation. The allocation to the
Company's joint venture in such
 
                                       11
<PAGE>   14
 
contracts has declined over time since the initial 1973 contract allocation at
97.9%, when the joint venture was virtually the only supplier to the Bontang
plant, to the present when there are two other major production sharing
contractors supplying gas to the Bontang plant and sharing in the allocation of
volumes. In 1995, Pertamina set the participation of the joint venture for most
of the quantities required by the 1973 contract extension and for certain years
of the new CPC and KGC long-term contracts at 21.6% based upon the joint
venture's uncommitted reserves as of May 31, 1994, which percentage is less than
the joint venture's participation in other existing LNG contracts. Pertamina has
not yet allocated among the joint venture and the other production sharing
contractors supplying natural gas to the Bontang plant the natural gas supply
obligation in support of the extension of the 1981 contract or the remaining
years of the new CPC and KGC long-term contracts; however, the Company expects
that the joint venture's participation will be less than 21.6%. A final
determination regarding the joint venture's participation percentage for a
portion of the 1981 extension and the remaining years of the new CPC and KGC
long-term contracts will be based upon reserves certified as of April 1995 and
is expected in 1996. A final determination for the last year of the 1973
extension and the rest of the 1981 extension is not expected before 1999.
Because the joint venture's participation percentage will be less, the joint
venture's and the Company's right to receive revenues attributable to the sale
of LNG under the extensions of the 1973 and 1981 contracts and the new CPC and
KGC long-term contracts will be less than that under the original contracts with
those buyers. The Company cannot predict the percentage participation that the
joint venture will have in other future contracts. The Company expects, however,
that absent the discovery of significant additional gas reserves in the joint
venture's contract area, the joint venture's percentage participation in such
future sales contracts will be less than that currently received. See the table
presented below for additional information.
 
     The 1973 and 1981 contracts (including extensions thereof) and the CPC, CPC
(Badak VI), Osaka, Korean Carryover, Korea II, KGC (Badak V) and MCGC contracts
(collectively, the "long-term contracts") contain take-or-pay provisions that
generally require that the purchasers either take the contracted quantities or
pay for such quantities even if not taken. Prior to any extensions, the initial
term of each long-term contract is approximately 20 years. The other contracts
described in the table are short-term contracts and generally have a term of ten
years or less. Of the remaining LNG sales volumes to be delivered after December
31, 1995, under all of the contracts described in the table below, the long-term
contracts and the short-term contracts represent approximately 98% and 2%,
respectively, of such deliveries.

</TABLE>
 
- ---------------
 
(a)  The joint venture's participation percentage is set by Pertamina based upon
     uncommitted reserves of the various production sharing contractors
     supplying gas to the Bontang plant. The participation percentages
     determined by Pertamina apply to new contracts, or amendments or extensions
     of contracts, entered into during certain time periods. During 1995,
     Pertamina set the joint venture's participation percentage at 21.6%, based
     upon the joint venture's uncommitted natural gas reserves certified as of
     May 1994, for the 2000-2009 period of the extension of the 1973 contract,
     the first two years of the CPC (Badak VI) and KGC (Badak V) contracts and,
     in general, for sales of LNG during the period from 1994 to 1999 under new
     contracts or renewals or extensions of existing contracts. Pertamina has
     not yet established the joint venture's participation percentage in the
     first five and a half years of the 1981 extension or the 2000-2017 period
     of the CPC (Badak VI) and KGC (Badak V) long-term contracts; however, the
     Company expects the percentage to be less than 21.6%. The Company expects a
     final determination from Pertamina in 1996. For other future sales
     contracts, including the remaining term of the 1981 extension and the final
     year of the 1973 extension, the Company cannot predict the participation
     percentage of the joint venture in such contracts, although absent the
     discovery of significant additional gas reserves in the joint venture's
     contract area, the participation percentage is expected to be less than
     21.6%.
 
(b)  Those contracts that show two joint venture participation percentages have
     been amended or extended to provide for additional deliveries. The second
     percentage indicates the portion of gas to be supplied under the amendment
     or extension of such contract by the joint venture. The joint venture has a
     97.9% and 27.2% interest in 258 and 446 remaining TBtus, respectively, of
     the total 704 TBtus remaining to be sold under the 1973 contract; a 66.4%
     and 29.6% interest in 1,238 and 126 remaining TBtus, respectively, of the
     total 1,364 TBtus remaining to be sold under the 1981 contract; and a 29.6%
     and 27.2% interest in 26 and 14 remaining TBtus, respectively, of the total
     40 TBtus remaining to be sold under the Toho contract.
 
(c)  The joint venture's share of remaining LNG sales volumes represents volumes
     available to the joint venture under the sales contracts for servicing its
     share of plant operating and debt service costs, as
                                             (Notes continued on following page)
 
                                       13
<PAGE>   16
 
     applicable, for recovering exploration, development and production costs
     and for profit sharing between the joint venture and Pertamina.
 
(d)  As discussed in footnote (a) above, the joint venture's participation in 
     the 1973 extension is 21.6% for the period 2000-2009. The joint venture's 
     share of the contracted volumes for such period is 942 TBtus.
 
(e)  As discussed in footnote (a) above, the joint venture's participation in 
     the 1981 extension has not been determined by Pertamina.
 
(f)  As discussed in footnote (a) above, the joint venture's participation in 
     the CPC (Badak VI) contract and KGC (Badak V) contract is 21.6% for the 
     period 1998-1999. The participation percentage for the contract years 2000
     and beyond has not been determined by Pertamina. The joint venture's share
     of the contracted volumes under the CPC (Badak VI) and KGC (Badak V) 
     contracts for the period 1998-1999 is 9 TBtus and 22 TBtus, respectively.
 
     In general, the processing and operating costs of the Bontang plant are
charged to each LNG and LPG sales contract during each year based upon the ratio
of the sum of BTUs of LNG and LPG processed by the Bontang plant for each
contract to the total number of BTUs processed by the Bontang plant.
 
     Under the 1973, extended 1973, extended 1981, Korean Carryover, MCGC, CPC
and CPC (Badak VI) long-term contracts and, in general, the short-term
contracts, LNG is sold on a delivered basis (i.e., title and risk of loss do not
pass until the LNG is unloaded at the customers' facilities). Under the 1981,
Osaka, Korea II and KGC (Badak V) contracts, LNG is delivered F.O.B. (i.e.,
title and risk of loss pass upon loading at Pertamina's port facility). Payments
for LNG under all of the LNG sales contracts are, or will be, made by the
purchasers in U.S. dollars directly to a bank in the United States that acts as
trustee and paying agent (the "Trustee") with respect to sales proceeds. Bontang
plant processing fees, debt service with respect to plant financings,
transportation (as required) and other costs are deducted from sales proceeds,
and the balance is then distributed to Pertamina, the members of the joint
venture and the other production sharing contractors.
 
     At December 31, 1995, the average LNG price under all contracts supplied
from the Bontang plant was $2.83 per MMBtu, or $3.13 per Mcf. Prices under the
contracts are subject to monthly adjustments. As of December 31, 1995, January
31, 1996, and March 1, 1996, the average price for the group of crude oils used
to determine the price of LNG was $18.16, $19.10 and $18.70 per Bbl,
respectively. The Company is unable to predict the amount or timing of future
changes in the price of this group of crude oils. Every $1.00 change in the
average of the price of this group of crude oils results in approximately a
$0.17 per Mcf change in the price of LNG.
 
     Pertamina also sells LPG produced at the LPG processing facilities at the
Bontang plant under seven contracts with Japanese purchasers, each of which is
for a ten-year term. The Bontang plant delivers an aggregate of up to 800,000
metric tons of LPG (5.9 MMboe) per year to support these contracts. The joint
venture currently has 29.6% and 21.6% participations in the gas processed at the
Bontang plant to supply quantities of LPG to be sold under the LPG contracts.
Pertamina may from time to time sell quantities of LPG outside of the seven LPG
contracts, and to the extent that such sales are made, the joint venture
currently will have a 21.6% participation in the gas processed at the Bontang
plant to supply those additional sales. A significant portion of the LPG sales
proceeds from sales under the seven contracts is dedicated to the repayment of
financing of the LPG processing facilities at the Bontang plant.
 
  U.K. North Sea
 
     The Company's principal U.K. North Sea properties include interests in the
Piper, Claymore, Saltire, Chanter, Scapa and Alba oil fields, the Sean gas
fields and the Britannia gas and condensate field. The Company also owns a 20%
interest in the Flotta terminal and pipeline system located in the Orkney
Islands in Scotland.
 
     Piper and Claymore Fields. In 1971, the Company joined a consortium of
companies, of which Elf Enterprise Caledonia Limited is now the operator, to
explore for oil and gas in certain areas of the North Sea. The Company has a 20%
working interest (17.5% revenue interest after government royalty) in the Piper
and Claymore fields discovered in 1972 and 1974, respectively. Production from
Piper and Claymore originally
 
                                       14
<PAGE>   17
 
began in late 1976 and late 1977, respectively and after being shut down in July
1988, Claymore recommenced in 1989, and Piper recommenced in 1993 from a new
fixed platform ("Piper B"). Oil production from the fields is transferred 135
miles via the joint venture's pipeline to the Flotta terminal. The proved
reserves (net) as of December 31, 1995, contained in the Piper and Claymore
fields are 17 MMboe and 19 MMboe, respectively. Average daily production of oil
and liquids (net to the Company) for 1995 from the Piper and Claymore fields was
16 MBbls and 8 MBbls, respectively.
 
     In 1995, construction and installation of a new platform to provide
personnel accommodation facilities for the Claymore field were completed. The
new facilities replaced accommodations on the Claymore A production platform and
a floating unit that was moored alongside. The Company's total share of the cost
of this new platform from the project's inception in 1992 to its completion in
1995 was $36 million, including $9 million spent in 1995. The costs of the
platform were fully deductible in the year incurred for purposes of determining
the U.K. Petroleum Revenue Tax ("PRT") payable with respect to production from
the Claymore field.
 
     The Piper and Claymore fields are currently subject to PRT at a 50%
statutory rate, which is based on the net value of oil and gas produced from
each field and on pipeline tariffs. The U.K. tax structure has encouraged
development of smaller fields in the northern North Sea by exempting all or part
of their production from PRT. These fields, such as the Saltire, Chanter and
Scapa fields described below, are referred to as edge oil fields because they
generally have separate field designations, incur little or no PRT, have no
government royalty interest burden and are developed as satellites from an
existing platform. It is anticipated that only small amounts of PRT, if any,
will be paid on the production from these fields. Production exempted from PRT
provides a greater contribution to cash flow on a per-barrel basis. All
production is subject to the U.K. corporation tax, which is at the current rate
of 33% (27.5% effective rate after benefits provided by the U.K./U.S. tax
treaty). Under current U.S. tax law, the PRT and U.K. corporation tax may be
credited against U.S. taxes.
 
     Saltire Field. The Company has a 20% working and revenue interest in the
Saltire field, which was discovered by the joint venture in 1988. The Company
developed Saltire using a fixed platform connected subsea to the Piper B
platform. The Saltire platform was completed and production began in May 1993.
Average daily production (net to the Company) for 1995 was 9 MBbls of oil and
liquids. Proved reserves (net) at December 31, 1995, for Saltire were 9 MMboe.
 
     Chanter Field. The Company has a 20% working and revenue interest in the
Chanter field, which is comprised of two reservoirs, one oil and the other
natural gas and condensate. Production from the Chanter field began in May 1993.
The Chanter field was developed as a subsea satellite to the Piper B platform.
Average daily production (net to the Company) for 1995 was 1 MBbl of oil and
liquids. The proved reserves (net) contained in the field are 2 MMboe as of
December 31, 1995.
 
     Scapa Field. The Scapa field, in which the Company has a 20% working and
revenue interest, was discovered in 1975 and is produced using a subsea
production facility tied to the Claymore platform. Average daily production (net
to the Company) for 1995 was 3 MBbls of oil and liquids. Proved reserves (net)
at December 31, 1995, for the Scapa field were 6 MMboe of oil.
 
     Alba Field. In July 1995, the Company acquired from Oryx U.K. Energy
Company ("Oryx") a 15.5% working and revenue interest in the central U.K. North
Sea's Block 16/26, which includes the Alba oil field, for approximately $270
million. Oil is pumped from a platform located in the northern portion of the
Alba field to a permanently moored floating storage unit three miles away. A
dedicated shuttle tanker transports oil to refineries in the U.K. and Europe. At
year-end, proved reserves (net) for the Alba field were 43 MMBbls of oil, of
which 23 MMBbls are classified as proved undeveloped. The Company anticipates
recording additional proved reserves based on the field's production history and
future development activity. The Alba field, which commenced production in
January 1994, is expected to produce for over 20 years. Average daily production
(net to the Company) for the last six months of 1995 was 11 MBbls of oil.
Chevron U.K. Limited operates the field. Revenues from the Alba field are
subject to U.K. corporation tax, but are not subject to U.K. royalty. The
Company anticipates that only small amounts of PRT will be paid on the Company's
production.
 
                                       15

     Sean Fields. The Company has a 25% working interest (24.375% revenue
interest after overriding royalty) in the Sean gas development project,
discovered in 1969 in the southern portion of the U.K. North Sea. The project,
operated by Shell U.K. Limited, consists of the North, South and East Sean
fields. The proved reserves (net) as of December 31, 1995, contained in the
fields were 23 MMboe.
 
     The Sean platforms, which currently serve the North, South and East Sean
fields, made their first deliveries in December 1986. Under the terms of a gas
sales contract terminating in 2011 with British Gas plc, ("BG") the Company will
deliver, during each winter contract period, an average minimum of 3.1 Bcf (net
to the Company) from the North and South Sean fields, up to the maximum field
contractual reserve of 425 Bcf (104 Bcf net to the Company). This peak-shaving
gas sales agreement also provides that currently proved gas reserves from the
North and South Sean fields may be sold only to BG. The price under the gas
sales agreement is based upon the volume of gas taken and various U.K. price
indices. The average price for 1995 was $3.37 per Mcf. The Company also earns a
capacity charge during the fall and winter months, which is independent of
production levels, to ensure field deliverability of 600 MMcf (gross) per day.
The capacity charge for 1995 totaled $35 million (net to the Company), and the
revenue for the volume of gas taken on 26 days of production was $13 million
(net to the Company). The Company anticipates that, at current production
levels, only small amounts of PRT will be paid over the next few years with
respect to the Company's production from the North and South Sean fields.
 
     Discovered in 1994, the East Sean field is separated from the producing
reservoirs of the North and South Sean fields, and as a result, production from
the East Sean field is not subject to the peak-shaving contract with BG. The
majority of the Company's share of gas from the East Sean field, which produces
year-round, is sold to Alliance Gas Limited under a short-term contract; the
balance is sold on the spot market. 1995 marked the first full year of
production from the field, which averaged 11,500 Mcf (net) per day. The Company
also participated in 1995 in two wells to test structures adjacent to the East
Sean field, one of which was successful. Production from the East Sean Field is
not subject to PRT.
 
     Britannia Field. In 1994, the Company acquired a 9.42% unit interest in the
undeveloped Britannia natural gas and condensate field, a portion of which
underlies the Alba field, in the U.K. North Sea from Fina Exploration Limited
and Fina Petroleum Development Limited, subsidiaries of Petrofina SA. The
purchase price was $159 million. The Company's total share of development costs
for its interest in the Britannia field is estimated to be approximately $200
million, at current exchange rates, over a five-year period from 1994 to 1998.
As of December 31, 1995, the Company has spent $34 million, of which $31 million
was spent in 1995, for drilling activities and initial platform fabrication and
facilities work and expects to spend approximately $60 million in 1996. The
Britannia field is operated by Britannia Operator Limited, a joint venture
between Conoco (U.K.) Limited and Chevron U.K. Limited. Production from
Britannia is expected to begin in late 1998. Long-term agreements have been
reached to sell a substantial portion of the gas production in the U.K. market
to four purchasers: Kinetica Limited, Mobil Gas Marketing (U.K.) Limited,
National Power plc and Total Gas Marketing Limited. The gas production will be
processed at the SAGE terminal in St. Fergus in northeastern Scotland, which
will be expanded by the SAGE owners to accommodate the Britannia production. A
pipeline will be constructed to transport the production from Britannia to the
SAGE terminal. As of December 31, 1995, proved undeveloped reserves (net) for
the Britannia field were 46 MMboe, reflecting upward reserve revisions recorded
during 1995 of 8 MMboe. Revenues from the Britannia field will be subject to the
U.K. corporation tax, but will not be subject to U.K. royalty or PRT.
 
     Customers. For 1995, the Company's U.K. operations had crude oil sales at
prevailing market prices to B.P. Oil International Limited and Elf Trading, two
major international oil and gas companies, equal to 13% and 13%, respectively,
of the Company's total sales and operating revenues. Because of the broad market
for crude oil in the U.K., the Company believes that the loss of these customers
would not have a material adverse effect on the Company. See Note 12 of Notes to
Consolidated Financial Statements. BG has publicly indicated a strategy to
renegotiate its gas purchase agreements with producers in the U.K. Also, BG has
announced a proposed corporate reorganization to transfer BG's gas supply
business into a new subsidiary, which the Company believes will include the
Piper and Sean purchase agreements. The Company cannot predict what effect, if
any, such actions will have on the Company.

     Other Information. Production from the Company's interest in the U.K.
fields totaled 17 MMboe during 1995, an increase of 16% from 1994. With a
full-year production from the Alba field, the Company expects a modest increase
in this 1995 production level for 1996 despite anticipated production declines
from certain U.K. fields. Payment to the Company with respect to oil production
from the Piper, Claymore, Saltire, Chanter, Scapa and Alba fields is made in
U.S. dollars, and payments for gas production including under the Sean gas sales
agreements with BG and Alliance Gas Limited are made in pounds sterling. There
are no significant restrictions on the repatriation of funds from the Company's
U.K. subsidiary to the United States. Dividends paid to the Company by its U.K.
subsidiary are subject to a 25% U.K. advance corporation tax. Approximately
27.5% of this tax (or approximately 6.9% of the dividend paid) is available for
immediate refunding to the Company by the U.K. government. All of this tax
(including the refunded portion) may be credited against the U.K. corporation
tax paid by the Company's U.K. subsidiary.

Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operation.
 
  Pakistan
 
     Badin Concessions
 
     Since 1977, the Company has participated through joint ventures in the
exploration for, and development and production of, oil and gas in the Badin
area of the Sindh Province in southeastern Pakistan. The Company's activities
are conducted under three concession agreements.
 
     1977 Concession. In April 1977, the Pakistan government granted exploration
rights in the Badin area to the Company and its co-venturers (the "1977
concession" or the "Badin-I concession"). The Company is the operator of a joint
venture that includes the Oil and Gas Development Corporation, a Pakistan
government-owned company. The oil and gas reserves discovered under the 1977
concession continue to be produced under leases granted by the Pakistan
government. The terms of such leases are 30 years from the date that they were
first granted. The Company has a 30% working interest (26.25% revenue interest)
in the 1977 concession area.
 
     1992 Concession. In 1992, the joint venture was granted a three-year
extension of the exploration license that it originally received in 1977 (the
"1992 concession" or the "Badin-II concession"). The oil and gas reserves
discovered under the 1992 concession will be produced under 20-year leases
granted by the Pakistan government. Production from the 1992 concession began
during 1995. The Company has a 25.5% working interest (22.3% revenue interest)
in the 1992 concession area.
 
     1995 Concession. The exploration license granted by the Pakistan government
in 1992 under the Badin II concession expired in January 1995. In December 1994,
the joint venture and the Pakistan government signed a new petroleum concession
agreement (the "1995 concession"). The 1995 concession provides that the
exploration license will be extended for three one-year periods beginning
January 1995, subject to satisfying certain minimum work requirements. The 1995
concession also provides that the Company will act as operator and will bear 38%
of the costs of exploration, including 12.5% attributable to the Pakistan
government. Under the 1995 concession, the Company will explore for and develop
oil and gas on the approximately 1.6 million acres in the Badin area not covered
by leases granted under the 1977 concession or the 1992 concession. As
discoveries are made, the joint venture will apply for individual 20-year leases
in which the Company will have a 25.5% working interest (22.3% revenue
interest), provided the Pakistan government elects to exercise its option to
increase its working interest in each such discovery to 25%.
 
     The Pakistan government is contractually obligated under the 1992 and 1995
concession agreements to issue leases upon the determination of a commercial
discovery and the fulfillment by the joint venture of the conditions of the
concession agreements and the exploration license.
 
     Proved reserves (net) at December 31, 1995, for the Company's interest in
the Badin concessions were 4 MMBbls of oil and 121 Bcf of gas. The joint venture
under the 1977 and 1992 concessions produced approximately 37% of Pakistan's
total domestic oil output and 10% of the country's gas production in 1995.
Average daily production (net to the Company) during 1995 was 5 MBbls of oil and
45 MMcf of gas. The Company's share of the oil produced from the 1977 and 1992
concessions is sold for both Pakistan domestic
 
                                       17
<PAGE>   20
 
use and for export. The price received for oil sold domestically is tied to the
average spot market price of Middle Eastern crude oil. In 1995, the Company
supplied 1 MMBbl of oil (net to the Company) for export at prices based on
competitive spot market rates. The Company and its co-venturers sell natural gas
produced from the 1977 concession area to Sui Southern Gas Company, Ltd.
("SSGC"). The contract expires in 2003 and provides that SSGC must either take
or pay for the contracted quantities of natural gas. Natural gas produced from
the 1992 concession area is also sold to SSGC under a contract with terms
similar to the SSGC contract covering production from the 1977 concession.
 
     During 1995, the Company drilled 12 exploratory wells in the Badin
concessions, five of which were discoveries. The discoveries included three gas
fields, one oil and gas field and one oil field. During 1996, the Company plans
to drill up to seven exploration wells and nine development wells in the Badin
concessions.
 
     Eastern Sindh Concession
 
     In April 1995, the Company signed a concession agreement with the Pakistan
government covering approximately 1.8 million acres in the Eastern Sindh block
in the Sindh Province of southeastern Pakistan for which the Company was granted
an exploration license in December 1994. The concession agreement and the
exploration license provide the Company with the right to explore for oil and
gas for an initial period of three years, with an option for three extensions of
one year each, and upon a commercial discovery, the right to apply for a 20-year
lease with the Pakistan government. The Company is the operator and has a 70%
working interest in the concession and exploration license, which is subject to
reduction if the Pakistan government elects to participate upon discovery of
commercial production. During 1996, the Company plans to conduct seismic and
other geological and geophysical studies on this concession.
 
  Other International
 
     In addition to the activities described above, the Company conducts
evaluations as well as undertakes exploration activities worldwide to expand its
reserve base. The Company has budgeted approximately $21 million during 1996 for
exploration projects in the U.K. North Sea, Indonesia and Pakistan. The Company
has also budgeted a total of $16 million for exploration activities during 1996
in other international areas, including primarily the activities described
below. See Item 7 -- Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition
and Results of Operations. The Company is also pursuing the possibility of
investing in downstream opportunities in Pakistan and Indonesia, including
electrical power generation and LPG projects.
 
     Italy. In 1995, the Company acquired interests in three onshore exploration
permits covering approximately 216,000 acres in the Basilicata Region in
southern Italy. The Company serves as operator of and holds a 42% working
interest in the Serra Corneta permit. The Company also holds a 33.33% working
interest in the Tempa dei Mercanti permit, operated by Edison Gas, and a 20%
working interest in the Forenza permit, operated by LASMO International Limited.
Geological and seismic studies on the three permit areas were conducted in 1995
and will continue in 1996. The Company has also filed an application with the
Italian government for an additional exploration permit near the Serra Corneta
and Tempa dei Mercanti permit areas.
 
     The Company also entered into an agreement in 1995 to acquire a 20% working
interest in the onshore Baragiano permit, which covers about 93,000 acres in the
Basilicata region, from Enterprise Oil Exploration Ltd. ("Enterprise"), subject
to approval by the Italian government. Enterprise serves as operator, and the
permit's first exploration well is scheduled to begin the first half of 1996.
 
     Tunisia. In 1993, the Company obtained an oil and gas exploration permit
offshore Tunisia from the Government of Tunisia. The permit calls for a
four-year exploration program on the approximately one-million-acre Ramla block.
The block is situated about 80 miles offshore in the Gulf of Gabes,
approximately 140 miles southeast of the city of Tunis. The Company serves as
operator and bears 50% of the exploration costs. In the event of a commercial
discovery, the Tunisian national oil company has the right to participate for up
to a 50% working interest. The permit may be extended for an additional
four-year term under certain conditions. The Company drilled a well on the Ramla
block in 1995 which found a significant oil column and an active hydrocarbon
system, but poor reservoir quality at that location made the accumulation non-
 
                                       18
<PAGE>   21
 
commercial. In December 1995, the Company acquired additional seismic on the
block. One additional exploration well is planned for late 1996.
 
     In 1994, the Company also acquired a 65% working interest in the onshore
Jeffara exploration permit, which covers approximately 970,000 acres in the
Medenine Region of southeastern Tunisia. The Company's interest is subject to
the Tunisian national oil company's right to participate for up to a 50% working
interest in the event of a commercial discovery. The Jeffara exploration permit,
which is operated by the Company, has an initial three-year term expiring in
1996, with an optional two-year extension. The initial exploratory well drilled
in 1995 was plugged and abandoned. During 1996, the Company will study seismic
and drilling information and other data to determine whether to exercise its
option to extend the permit by future drilling.
 
     Eastern Indonesia. In Eastern Indonesia, the Company is the operator of
four production sharing contracts originally covering approximately 13 million
acres in the Maluku (Moluccas) Island group in the Banda Sea. At year-end, the
Company held a 60% working interest in the Tanimbar and Rebi production sharing
contracts and a 33.33% working interest in the Kai and Barakan production
sharing contracts, following the transfer of a 26.67% working interest in the
Kai and Barakan contracts to a third party during 1995. The initial exploration
well drilled during 1995 in the area was unsuccessful. In 1996, the Company
plans to relinquish all but the Kai contract, retaining about 4.6 million acres,
and drill a well in such contract area. The Company also expects to increase its
interest in the Kai contract to 44.44%.
 
     Argentina. The Company serves as operator and has a 50% working interest in
the Cuenca Colorado Marina-1 ("CCM-1"), located in the South Atlantic Ocean
about 310 miles south of Buenos Aires. The exploration permit granted by the
Argentine government currently extends until August 1997 and provides the
Company with the option to extend the term of the agreement until 2001 by
meeting certain additional drilling obligations. An additional two-year
extension to 2003 is possible if the Company elects to drill one well for each
year of the extension. The initial exploratory well drilled in 1994 on the CCM-1
block was unsuccessful, as were the two additional wells drilled in 1995. During
1996, the joint venture intends to acquire new seismic data and study results
from these wells to determine future drilling plans. In February 1996, the
Company relinquished 50% of the CCM-1 block, leaving 2.2 million acres under the
permit.
 
     Ireland/England. In 1995, the Company acquired a 25% working and revenue
interest in five and one-half offshore blocks encompassing 194,000 acres in St.
George's Channel offshore Ireland operated by Marathon Oil Company ("Marathon").
An initial exploratory well drilled in 1995 was unsuccessful. The joint venture
expects to study the results from this well to determine future drilling plans.
 
     The Company also acquired in 1995 a 15% working and revenue interest in a
joint venture that was awarded eight offshore blocks covering 400,000 acres in
St. George's Channel offshore Western England operated by Marathon. This acreage
contains a small gas discovery and is complementary to the acreage described
above offshore Ireland. The joint venture drilled one exploratory well in 1995,
which was unsuccessful. The joint venture plans to drill two additional wells in
late 1996 or 1997.
 
     In 1995, the Company also acquired a 15% working and revenue interest in
five and one-half blocks, covering 344,000 acres in the Porcupine basin,
offshore southwest Ireland. The joint venture, operated by Statoil (U.K.) Ltd.
("Statoil"), was granted a license to explore for oil and natural gas for a
15-year period, subject to certain minimum work requirements during each
four-year period. In 1994, the Company acquired a 30% working and revenue
interest in a joint venture that was awarded 11 blocks offshore Ireland. The
blocks cover 650,000 acres and are located in the Atlantic Ocean about 43 miles
west of Ireland in the Slyne/Erris basins. The joint venture, operated by
Statoil, was granted the right to explore for oil and natural gas for a 16-year
period, subject to certain minimum work requirements at four-year intervals.
During the initial terms of the Slyne/Erris and Porcupine exploration licenses,
each joint venture plans to acquire seismic data as well as conduct additional
geological and geophysical studies. After the acquisition of the seismic data
and the performance of other studies, each joint venture will determine whether
the geology warrants drilling any wells and continuing its respective license.
 
     Australia. The Company entered into an agreement in 1995 to acquire an 80%
interest in 81 blocks covering 1.6 million acres in the Canning Basin of Western
Australia. The initial exploration period of the
 
                                       19
<PAGE>   22
 
permit expires in April 1998. During 1996, the Company plans to acquire seismic
data to determine whether to exercise its option to drill an exploratory well to
retain its interest.
 
     Other. The Company also has interests in oil and gas exploration activities
in Papua New Guinea and Vietnam.
 
ALASKA
 
     The Company also pursues exploration projects in Alaska. At year-end 1995,
the Company held acreage primarily in Western Colville, the Kenai Peninsula and
offshore the Beaufort Sea in Alaska.
 
     Western Colville. Since 1992, the Company has participated in exploration
drilling activities in the Western Colville area on Alaska's North Slope, in
which the Company currently has a 22% working interest. During the 1995 winter
drilling season, the Company participated in the completion of five wells, of
which three were sidetracks. The Company believes that geologically recoverable
oil reserves have been identified by well penetrations in this area (including
the wells drilled during 1995 and in prior years), and that based on the results
of the 1995 winter drilling season, additional reserves could be found by future
drilling on the Company's leasehold. The Company anticipates that further
delineation drilling and engineering studies will need to be conducted before
commercial development would be possible. The Company expects to participate in
three to six delineation and exploration wells to be drilled during the 1996
winter drilling season and a 100 square mile 3-D seismic survey. ARCO Alaska,
Inc. is the operator of the Colville venture.
 
     Kenai Peninsula. Effective November 1, 1993, the Company entered into a
three-year exploration agreement with Cook Inlet Region, Inc. ("CIRI"), an
Alaska Native Regional Corporation. The agreement includes an initial option to
the Company to lease approximately 340,000 acres in the Kenai Peninsula in south
central Alaska. Under the agreement, the Company will bear 100% of the
exploration costs and may acquire leases on prospects identified, subject to
CIRI's option to participate in the leases and the exploration, drilling and
development of such prospects. As of March 1, 1996, the Company has exercised
options to lease approximately 18,700 acres and has a remaining option to lease
about 50,600 acres expiring on November 1, 1996. In 1995, the Company was also
awarded leases on 17 blocks onshore and offshore the Kenai Peninsula acquired in
a 1994 lease sale held by the State of Alaska. The Company also acquired 7
onshore blocks in the Kenai Peninsula in a 1995 lease sale, which were awarded
in February 1996. CIRI has an election to acquire a 20% working interest in such
leases under the terms of the exploration agreement. During 1995, the Company
interpreted seismic data, conducted geochemical and gravity field studies and
completed final mapping of several geologic horizons on its Kenai acreage. The
Company plans to evaluate seismic data and conduct other geochemical and
geophysical evaluations of the area during 1996. Drilling on the Kenai acreage
is scheduled to commence in late 1997 or 1998.
 
     Kuvlum. The Company holds 100% working interest in the Kuvlum federal
exploratory oil and gas unit in the Beaufort Sea offshore Northern Alaska for
further analysis. In 1993, the Company determined that the Kuvlum unit was not
commercial as a stand-alone development. See Item 7 -- Management's Discussion
and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.
 
PETROCHEMICALS
 
     Plant Operations. The Company's petrochemical business consists primarily
of the Company's 41.67% interest in the jointly owned Geismar ethylene plant
located on the Mississippi River near Baton Rouge, Louisiana. The plant began
operations in 1968. The Company operates the plant, with production costs and
plant production being shared by the co-owners according to their ownership
interests. With the start-up of the twelfth furnace at the plant during February
1995, the plant has the capacity to produce approximately 1.25 billion gross
pounds (521 million net) of ethylene and 92 million gross pounds (38 million
net) of polymer-grade propylene annually.
 
     In 1995 and 1994, the Company's net ethylene sales were 462 million pounds
and 436 million pounds, respectively, and its net propylene sales were 35
million pounds and 32 million pounds, respectively. The Company sells its share
of the ethylene produced by the plant to several major customers for the
manufacture
 
                                       20
<PAGE>   23
 
of plastics used in various consumer products. The sales price of ethylene
averaged $0.25 per pound in 1995 and $0.20 per pound in 1994. Sales of
propylene, used in the manufacture of various products such as building
materials, clothing and tires, averaged $0.19 per pound and $0.14 per pound in
1995 and 1994, respectively.
 
     During 1995, the average margin per pound of the Company's ethylene was
$0.13 per pound as compared to $0.06 per pound for 1994. Ethylene margins for
the fourth quarter of 1995 declined to an average of approximately $0.06 per
pound as compared to $0.12 per pound in the fourth quarter of 1994. The
Company's ethylene margin is primarily affected by the price received for the
ethylene and the cost of feedstock (natural gas liquids). Higher ethylene
prices, resulting from tight supplies of ethylene and increased demand, and
lower feedstock costs caused significantly higher margins during the second half
of 1994 and the first half of 1995 than margins currently experienced. See Item
7 -- Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of
Operations.
 
     Capital expenditures for the petrochemical business were $6 million (net to
the Company) during 1995. The Company plans to spend $10 million (net to the
Company) in capital expenditures for the petrochemical business during 1996,
which include costs for projects to enhance production and efficiency.
 
     Storage and Transportation. In addition to the Geismar plant, the Company
owns and operates a 192-mile ethane feedstock pipeline system, which transports
feedstock to its ethylene plant from several major suppliers, including the
Company's natural gas liquids fractionation plant and supporting 133 mile
pipeline system in Rayne, Louisiana. The Company also operates underground
storage terminals and a 78-mile ethylene pipeline system, portions of which are
jointly owned, to serve the Geismar facility and several other petrochemical
plants in the Baton Rouge area.
 
OTHER MATTERS
 
     Environmental. Various international, federal, state and local laws and
regulations covering the discharge of materials into the environment, or
otherwise relating to the protection of the environment, affect the Company's
operations and costs. In particular, the Company's petrochemical manufacturing,
gas liquids fractionation plant and other facilities for transporting,
fractionating, treating, storing or otherwise handling hydrocarbons and
hydrocarbon products and wastes therefrom are subject to stringent environmental
regulations relating to, among other things, solid and hazardous waste
management and disposal, air emissions, waste water treatment and other matters
that may affect the environment. Environmental regulations have had an
increasing impact upon the Company's operations. The Company is committed to
managing its operations in a safe and environmentally responsible manner and
believes that its operations and facilities are in general compliance with
applicable environmental regulations. Environmental expenditures for 1995 were
not material, nor are they expected to be material during 1996.
 
     The Company is unable to estimate the impact that current international,
federal and state standards and proposed initiatives or other future
developments in environmental regulations may have on future earnings or
operations, but it believes that required expenditures would not significantly
impact its competitive position with respect to other oil and gas and
petrochemical companies and would not be expected to have a material adverse
effect on the Company's financial position. Nevertheless, the risks of
substantial costs and liabilities are inherent in operations such as the
Company's. There can be no assurance that significant costs and liabilities will
not be incurred in the future.
 
     The Company has, in the past, owned, leased or operated numerous properties
in the U.S. that have been used for the production of oil and gas for many
years. Although the Company believes that its operating and disposal practices
were standard in the industry at the time and were generally in compliance with
then-existing rules and regulations, certain wastes may have been disposed of or
released or contamination has occurred on or under the properties owned, leased
or operated by the Company. State and federal laws applicable to oil and gas
wastes and properties have gradually become more strict. In addition, the
Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act ("CERCLA"),
also known as the "superfund" law, and comparable state laws impose liability,
without regard to fault or the legality of the original conduct, on certain
classes of persons that have contributed to the release of a "hazardous
substance"
 
                                       21
<PAGE>   24
 
into the environment. Under these laws, the Company could be required in the
future, including with respect to past and future properties, to remove or
remediate previously disposed of wastes or property contamination (including
groundwater contamination at onshore locations), to perform remedial plugging
operations to prevent future contamination or to clean up disposal sites where
"hazardous substances" from its operations have been taken.
 
     The Company's foreign operations are similarly subject to foreign laws
covering environmental and worker safety matters. Although these laws have
generally been less comprehensive than their U.S. counterparts, countries in
which the Company does business are increasing their environmental regulatory
and compliance standards. The Company's operations in the U.K. are subject to
the Prevention of Oil Pollution Act, the Environmental Protection Act and
related statutes and orders, as well as certain European Union agreements. The
foreign laws, however, have not had, and are not presently expected to have, a
material adverse effect on the Company.
 
     While the outcome of environmental contingencies, lawsuits or other
proceedings against the Company cannot be predicted with certainty, management
expects that such liabilities, to the extent not provided for through insurance
or otherwise, will not have a material adverse effect on the financial position
of the Company.
 
     Insurance. The oil and gas and petrochemical businesses can be hazardous,
involving unforeseen circumstances such as blowouts, explosions or environmental
damage. To address the hazards inherent in the oil and gas and petrochemical
businesses, the Company maintains a comprehensive insurance program covering its
worldwide interests. This insurance coverage includes physical damage coverage,
third party and comprehensive general liability insurance, as well as redrill,
well control and environmental and pollution coverage, although coverage for
environmental and pollution-related losses is subject to significant
limitations. In addition, the Company maintains business interruption insurance
on its major international oil and gas producing interests and on its
petrochemical business. The scope, amount and cost of this insurance vary
depending upon various market factors.
 
     Competition. The Company actively competes for exploration leases,
licenses, concessions and acquisitions, frequently against companies with
substantially greater financial and other resources, such as technical
capabilities and human resources. In addition, some of the Company's competitors
have greater experience, especially in certain international areas where the
Company is currently seeking to acquire interests.
 
     Regulation of Oil and Gas Production and Marketing. Petroleum production is
subject to various types of regulation throughout the world. Legislation
affecting the oil and gas industry is under regular review for amendment or
expansion, frequently increasing the regulatory burden. Statutes and regulations
require permits for drilling operations, drilling bonds and reports concerning
operations. Also, numerous departments and agencies are authorized by statute to
issue and have issued rules and regulations binding on the oil and gas industry
and its individual members. These rules and regulations pose difficult and
costly compliance and reporting requirements, some of which carry substantial
penalties for the failure to comply. Most of the foreign countries in which the
Company operates have statutes and regulations governing conservation matters,
including the unitization or pooling of oil and gas properties and rates of
production from oil and gas wells. The regulatory burden on the oil and gas
industry increases its costs of doing business and, consequently, affects its
profitability.
 
     Employees. As of February 29, 1996, the Company had approximately 1,100
employees. The Company believes that its relations with its employees are good.
 
     General. In July 1985, two limited partnerships (the "KKR Partnerships"),
which are affiliated with Kohlberg Kravis Roberts & Co. ("KKR"), purchased
approximately 50% of the then outstanding common stock of the Company from
AlliedSignal Inc. ("Allied"). In September 1987, the Company sold 18,000,000
shares of its common stock in concurrent public offerings in the United States
and outside the United States. In November 1992, Allied sold, in a secondary
public offering, its 33,333,334 shares of common stock, which represented
approximately 39% of the Company's issued and outstanding shares of common
stock. In May 1995, the KKR Partnerships sold, in a secondary public offering,
11,500,000 shares of their 33,333,334
 
                                       22
<PAGE>   25
 
shares of common stock, which represented approximately 13% of the Company's
issued and outstanding shares of common stock. The Company did not receive any
proceeds from the secondary public offerings. The KKR Partnerships currently own
approximately 25% of the Company's issued and outstanding shares of common
stock. See Item 7 -- Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition
and Results of Operations and Note 1 of Notes to Consolidated Financial
Statements.
 
     In 1991, the Company consummated three separate transactions in which it
sold its U.S. onshore and offshore exploration and production businesses and its
gas processing business for a total cash consideration of approximately $861
million. The buyers in each of the transactions assumed substantially all of the
liabilities related to the respective businesses or assets that they acquired.
 
     During 1992, the Company successfully completed a financial restructuring
through a series of financial transactions that significantly streamlined its
capital structure. The Company redeemed its outstanding $410 million of
subordinated notes, redeemed for $200 million plus accrued dividends its
outstanding Series B and Series C Preferred Stock, redeemed for $300 million its
outstanding warrants to purchase the Company's common stock and repaid at
maturity its $100 million senior subordinated notes. In 1992, the Company also
issued $100 million in principal amount of senior notes. Since 1992, the Company
has continued to restructure its financial position, including the redemption
for $75 million plus accrued dividends of its outstanding Preferred Auction Rate
Stock. In 1995, the Company restructured its credit facilities, and publicly
issued $300 million principal amount of notes at varying maturities and interest
rates. A subsidiary of the Company also entered into a 150 million pounds
sterling secured financing in 1995 to fund the Company's share of the cost of
development of the Britannia field. In addition, in 1995 the Company authorized
a new class of 15 million shares of preferred stock that may be issued from time
to time. For more information regarding these transactions, see Item
7 -- Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of

(a)  In the year ended December 31, 1991, the Company recognized an 
     extraordinary tax benefit of $53 million from utilization of net operating
     loss carryforwards as a result of the sale of its domestic exploration,
     production and gas processing businesses for $861 million in cash. In the
     first quarter of 1992, the Company recognized an extraordinary loss of $20
     million as a result of the early redemption of its Senior Subordinated
     Reset Notes and 13% Subordinated Notes.
        
(b)  In 1992, the Company adopted, effective January 1, 1992, two new accounting
     standards for income taxes and postretirement benefits, respectively.

ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS
OF OPERATIONS.
 
RESULTS OF OPERATIONS
 
     1995 Compared with 1994. Net income for the year ended December 31, 1995
was $102 million, or $1.17 per share as compared to net income of $67 million,
or $.76 per share reported for the year ended December 31, 1994. The 1995
earnings were favorably impacted by higher U.S. ethylene margins and sales
volumes, higher volumes and prices in the U.K. and Pakistan and higher
Indonesian LNG prices, partially offset by higher exploration expenses, higher
interest expense and lower LNG volumes in Indonesia.
 
     Sales and operating revenues for 1995 were $852 million up from $748
million in 1994. International revenues totaled $651 million as compared to $578
million in 1994. In the U.K., sales and operating revenues increased by $63
million due to higher prices and increased sales volumes which were primarily a
result of the July 1995 acquisition of an interest in the Alba field. In
Indonesia, sales were $2 million below 1994 as a result of lower LNG volumes,
partially offset by higher prices. Lower LNG volumes were attributable to a
lower average participation interest in cargoes delivered during 1995 and the
timing of deliveries. In Pakistan, sales were $12 million above 1994 due to
higher volumes and prices.
 
     Petrochemical revenues totaled $200 million in 1995 as compared to $169
million in the prior year, while operating profit was $62 million as compared to
$24 million in 1994. The increase in operating profit was primarily due to
higher ethylene sales prices and lower feedstock cost, which resulted in an
increase in ethylene margins to 13 cents per pound in 1995 vs. 6 cents per pound
in 1994, as well as higher volumes.
 
     Average prices received and volumes sold by the Company's major operations
during 1995 and 1994, respectively, were as follows:

     Exploration expenses increased by $24 million primarily due to drilling
expenditures in Argentina, Ireland, Tunisia, Vietnam and Eastern Indonesia.
Interest expense increased by $17 million during the year due to higher levels
of debt associated with the Alba acquisition and to higher interest rates. The
effective tax rate decreased from the prior year due primarily to the increase
in U.S. petrochemical income, which is taxed at lower rates, partially offset by
higher new venture exploration expenses, most of which generate no tax benefits.
 
     1994 Compared with 1993. Net income for the year ended December 31, 1994
was $67 million, or $.76 per share, as compared to net income of $27 million, or
$.31 per share reported for the year ended December 31, 1993. Included in 1993
results are certain non-recurring items; excluding these items, net income for
the year ended December 31, 1993, was $54 million, or $.61 per share. The 1994
earnings were favorably impacted by higher volumes in the U.K. North Sea and
Indonesia, higher U.S. ethylene margins and lower operating expenses, partially
offset by lower oil and LNG prices and higher depreciation, depletion and
amortization expense related to the increased production.
 
     Sales and operating revenues for 1994 were $748 million, up approximately
10% from $682 million in 1993. International revenues totaled $578 million as
compared to $537 million in 1993. In the U.K., sales and operating revenues
increased $52 million as lower crude prices were more than offset by increased
production from the Piper block. In Indonesia, sales were $1 million below 1993
as a result of lower crude oil and LNG prices, which were partially offset by
higher LNG volumes. In Pakistan, sales were $10 million below 1993
 
                                       26
<PAGE>   29
 
primarily due to lower prices for crude oil and natural gas. The average sales
price for U.K. crude oil decreased from $15.10 to $14.99 per barrel. The average
sales price received for Indonesian LNG decreased from $3.17 per Mcf to $2.85
per Mcf. The average sales price for Pakistan natural gas decreased from $1.26
per Mcf to $1.07 per Mcf.
 
     Production costs per barrel of oil equivalent ("boe") for the Company's oil
and gas activities averaged $3.98 in 1994, down from $4.73 per boe in 1993
primarily as a result of increased volumes in the U.K., lower LNG plant costs in
Indonesia and the benefits of a Company-wide cost containment program.
 
     The operating profit for the Company's petrochemical operations was $16
million above the prior year. The increase primarily resulted from improved
ethylene margins reflecting higher sales prices for ethylene and lower costs.
 
     The prior year's results included four non-recurring items which in the
aggregate reduced 1993 earnings by $27 million. These items included
depreciation expense of $103 million ($48 million after tax) representing a
write-down of the Company's investment in the Piper field, a $25 million charge
to exploration expense due to the write-off of the Company's investment in the
Kuvlum prospect in Alaska and a $4 million charge for the cumulative effect of
adopting a new accounting standard for postemployment benefits. Partially
offsetting these items was a $50 million tax benefit associated with changes to
U.K. tax laws.
 
     Exploration expenses decreased by $40 million due to the prior year
write-off of Kuvlum, lower worldwide operating expenditures and reduced
expenditures in the U.K. and Indonesia. Depreciation, depletion and amortization
decreased by $74 million due to the prior period's write-down of the Piper
field, which was partially offset by increased production. Interest expense
increased $5 million due to lower capitalized interest related to the Piper
redevelopment project, which was substantially completed in 1993. The effective
tax rate was essentially level with the prior period, adjusted for the
non-recurring items mentioned previously.
 
FINANCIAL CONDITION AND LIQUIDITY
 
     General. The Company's capital expenditures for 1996 reflect a focus on
core holdings and a diversified exploration program. The Company's capital
expenditures for 1996 are estimated to be about $220 million, excluding
capitalized interest. Approximately $152 million of the 1996 capital budget is
allocated for oil and gas development projects in the U.K. North Sea, Indonesia
and Pakistan, including $60 million for the continued development of the
Britannia field and $16 million for development activities at the producing Alba
oil field. The Company has budgeted approximately $21 million for exploration
projects in the U.K. North Sea, Pakistan and Indonesia and has allocated $18
million for its activities in Alaska, including the Western Colville area on the
North Slope, and $16 million in new venture exploration activities primarily in
Tunisia, Italy, Ireland and Argentina. The Company has also budgeted
approximately $10 million for its petrochemical interests in the United States.
During 1996, the Company also intends to evaluate acquisition opportunities
worldwide of both developed and undeveloped oil and gas reserves, the costs of
which are not included in the capital expenditure budget. Based on existing
economic and market conditions, the Company believes operating cash flow will be
sufficient to fund its 1996 development and exploration activities and that its
available equity and financial credit strength give the Company financial
resources to make acquisitions.
 
     Cash flow from operations. Net cash provided by operating activities was
$234 million in 1995, an increase of $19 million from the prior year. The
increase was primarily the result of increased U.K. oil volumes, improved
ethylene margins and increased oil and gas prices, partially offset by lower LNG
volumes.
 
     Ethylene margins averaged approximately 13 cents per pound during 1995, as
compared to 6 cents per pound for 1994. However, ethylene margins averaged
approximately 6 cents per pound during the fourth quarter of 1995 and 4 cents
per pound for the month of December 1995. The ethylene business is cyclical and
the Company cannot predict the duration of any trends in the business. Prices
for ethylene are affected by worldwide and U.S. demand for petrochemicals,
inventory levels, feedstock costs and availability, plant utilization rates,
plant operations and costs and competitive capacity expansion. The Company
estimates that a margin change of an average one cent per pound for an entire
year at full capacity production can effect

operating profit and net income on an annualized basis for the petrochemical
business of the Company by approximately $5 million.
 
     Capital resources. Capital expenditures for 1995 (excluding the $270
million Alba acquisition), were $172 million, an increase from the prior year's
expenditures of $131 million (excluding the $159 million Britannia acquisition).
This increase was a result of the expanded exploration program and development
activity for the Britannia field. In 1995, 1994 and 1993, total Company capital
costs incurred, including capitalized interest and the Alba and Britannia
acquisitions, totaled $465 million, $309 million and $218 million, respectively.
 
     On July 18, 1995, the Company, through its subsidiary, Union Texas
Petroleum Limited ("UTPL"), acquired from Oryx UK Energy Company ("Oryx") a
15.5% working interest in Block 16/26 in the central United Kingdom North Sea,
which includes the Alba field. UTPL paid Oryx $270 million for the interest. The
effective date of the transaction was July 1, 1995. The Company funded the
acquisition under its bank credit facilities and its uncommitted and unsecured
lines of credit. As of December 31, 1995, the Company had recorded 43 million
barrels of oil as proved reserves, of which 23 million barrels are classified as
proved undeveloped. The Alba field commenced production in January 1994 and is
operated by Chevron U.K. Limited.
 
     Financing activities. The Company had three unsecured credit facilities
(the "Credit Facilities") at December 31, 1995. One of the Credit Facilities is
a $100 million unsecured credit agreement with a syndicate of banks, that
provides for conversion of amounts outstanding on April 15, 1996 to a one-year
term loan maturing April 15, 1997. Another Credit Facility is a $450 million
unsecured credit agreement with a syndicate of banks that provides for a
quarterly reduction of $35 million beginning July 31, 1998, with a final
maturity of April 30, 1999. The Company is pursuing the extension of the
maturity of the $450 million Credit Facility and the replacement of the $100
million Credit Facility. The $450 million revolver allows the Company to obtain
up to $300 million of availability thereunder in U.S. dollar loans that bear
interest at a rate determined in a competitive bid process. Loans under the $450
million revolver may be made in both pounds sterling and U.S. dollars at the
option of the Company. In June 1995, the Company entered into an additional $100
million unsecured credit agreement with certain banks providing for conversion
of amounts outstanding on June 15, 1996 to a one-year term loan maturing June
15, 1997. This undrawn facility was terminated January 31, 1996. Loans under the
Credit Facilities bear interest at floating market rates based on, at the
Company's option, the agent bank's base rate or LIBOR, plus applicable margins,
subject to increase in certain events. The Credit Facilities contain restrictive
covenants, including maintenance of certain coverage ratios related to the
incurrence of additional indebtedness and limitations on asset sales and mergers
or consolidations. The covenants also require maintenance of stockholders'
equity, as adjusted, at $350 million. Under the terms of the Credit Facilities,
the Company may pay dividends and make stock repurchases provided that such
level of minimum stockholders' equity is maintained and the Company complies
with certain other covenants in the Credit Facilities. At December 31, 1995, the
Company's adjusted stockholders' equity was approximately $500 million. At
December 31, 1995, $132 million was outstanding under the $450 million revolver
bearing interest at a weighted average rate of 6.17% per annum.
 
     Due to the Company's ability to obtain favorable interest rates on
short-term borrowings, uncommitted and unsecured lines of credit were
established with several banks in both U.S. dollars and pounds sterling. These
money market borrowings, which have a short-term maturity, have been classified
as long-term debt based on the Company's intent to refinance these borrowings
for a period exceeding one year and the ability to refinance them on a long-term
basis through its Credit Facilities. At December 31, 1995 and 1994, $148 million
and $106 million, respectively, were outstanding under these money market lines
which bore interest at weighted average rates of 6.5% and 6.46% per annum,
respectively. At December 31, 1995, the Company has adjusted the 1994 balance
sheet by reclassifying outstanding money market borrowings of $106 million from
current liabilities to long-term debt. Management believes that this
presentation is more meaningful for comparative analysis and appropriately
reflects management's intent at December 31, 1994. At February 29, 1996, $115
million and $119 million were outstanding under the Credit Facilities and the
uncommitted lines of credit, respectively. As of such date, the Company had
approximately $314 million of such available financing.

     In May 1995, the Company's indirect subsidiary, Union Texas Britannia
Limited ("UTBL"), which is a wholly owned subsidiary of UTPL, entered into a 150
million pounds sterling secured financing from a syndicate of banks. The
financing is used to fund the Company's share of the cost of developing the
Britannia field to production (including interest and other financing costs
incurred prior to completion and potential cost overruns), and any remaining
availability after completion may, subject to certain coverage ratios being met,
be used for UTBL's general corporate purposes. Except for certain support by
UTPL related to any potential cost overruns in excess of the facility amount
(limited to 30 million pounds sterling), insurance, tax benefits and
administrative services, the lenders' recourse will be limited to the Britannia
field project assets and is nonrecourse to the Company. The financing has a
final maturity in September 2005. At December 31, 1995, 19 million pounds
sterling ($29 million) was outstanding under UTBL's financing.
 
     In May 1995, pursuant to the secondary public offering registered by the
Company under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, 11.5 million shares of the
33.3 million shares of the Company's common stock owned by partnerships
affiliated with Kohlberg Kravis Roberts & Co. ("KKR") were sold in the open
market. The Company did not receive any proceeds from the offering. KKR
currently owns 21.8 million shares (approximately 25%) of the Company's issued
and outstanding common stock.
 
     In March 1995, the Company publicly issued $125 million principal amount of
8 3/8% Senior Notes due 2005 (the "8 3/8% Senior Notes") at an initial public
offering price of 99.431%. In April 1995, the Company publicly issued $75
million principal amount of 8 1/2% Senior Notes due 2007 (the "8 1/2% Senior
Notes") at an initial public offering price of 99.658%. The net proceeds from
the sale of the 8 3/8% Senior Notes and the 8 1/2% Senior Notes were
approximately $123.5 million and $74.2 million, respectively (after deducting
underwriting discount, commissions and offering expenses). The Company used such
proceeds to reduce debt under its existing credit facility and its uncommitted
and unsecured lines of credit. The Company's $100 million principal amount of
8.25% Senior Notes due 1999 ("the 8.25% Senior Notes") together with the 8 1/2%
Senior Notes and the 8 3/8% Senior Notes are referred to herein as the "Senior
Notes." The Senior Notes represent general unsecured obligations of the Company
and rank pari passu in right of payment with the Company's obligations under its
Credit Facilities, and senior in right of payment to any future subordinate
indebtedness of the Company. Each of the Senior Notes contain similar
restrictive covenants. The Senior Notes are redeemable at any time, at the
option of the Company, in whole or in part, at a price equal to 100% of their
principal amount plus accrued interest plus a make whole premium relating to the
then-prevailing Treasury Yield and the remaining life of the Senior Notes.
 
     During 1995, the Company obtained the release of the guarantees by certain
subsidiaries of the Company of the Company's Credit Facilities and the Senior
Notes.
 
     In 1995, the Company issued $100 million aggregate principal amount of
medium term notes ("MTN") with terms of seven and twelve years and interest
rates varying from 6.51% to 6.81%. The net proceeds from the sale of the MTN
were approximately $99.4 million and were used to reduce debt under the
Company's credit facility and its uncommitted and unsecured lines of credit.
These MTN represent general unsecured obligations of the Company and rank pari
passu in right of payment with the Company's obligations under its Credit
Facilities and Senior Notes and senior in right of payment to any future
subordinated indebtedness of the Company. Each of the MTN contain similar
restrictive covenants as the Senior Notes. The MTN are redeemable at any time,
at the option of the Company, in whole or in part, at a price equal to 100% of
the principal amount plus accrued interest plus a make-whole premium relating to
the then-prevailing Treasury Yield and the remaining life of the MTN.
 
     At the 1995 Annual Meeting of Stockholders held May 10, 1995, the Company's
stockholders approved the authorization of a new class of 15 million shares of
preferred stock. The new unissued preferred stock provides the Company
additional financing flexibility to issue from time to time based on current
market conditions.
 
     On April 27, 1994, the Company's Board of Directors authorized the
repurchase of up to 2,000,000 shares of the Company's common stock and pursuant
thereto, the Company had repurchased 554,536 shares as of December 31, 1995. The
repurchased stock will be used for general corporate purposes, including
fulfilling
 
                                       29
<PAGE>   32
 
employee benefit program obligations. At December 31, 1995, 247,145 shares of
common stock were held, at cost, as treasury shares.
 
     As of December 31, 1995, the Company's scheduled maturities of long-term
debt outstanding for the five-year period of 1996 through 2000 are approximately
$2 million, $2 million, $0 million, $396 million and $14 million, respectively.
The Company believes that it will have sufficient sources of funds to satisfy
these scheduled maturities. The Company may enter into interest rate swap
contracts from time to time. However, the Company did not enter into any
interest rate swap contracts during 1995.
 
     Financial Condition. In each of the four quarters ended December 31, 1995,
the Company declared and paid a dividend of approximately $4.3 million on its
common stock. On January 18, 1996, the Company announced a dividend on its
common stock of $.05 per share to stockholders of record as of January 31, 1996,
which was paid on February 15, 1996.
 
     In October 1995, the Financial Accounting Standards Board released
Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 123, "Accounting for Stock-Based
Compensation," which establishes financial and reporting standards for stock
based employee compensation plans that will be effective for the Company's 1996
financial statements. The statement encourages, but does not require, companies
to adopt a fair value based method of accounting for such plans in place of
current accounting standards. Companies electing to continue to use their
existing accounting methods will be required to make pro forma disclosures of
net income assuming a fair value based method of accounting has been applied.
The Company is evaluating the Statement as to whether to adopt the fair value
based method of accounting or continue using its current accounting methods with
additional disclosures.
 
     The Company may enter into hedging contracts from time to time in order to
minimize the impact of adverse price fluctuations; however, the Company did not
enter into any of these contracts during 1995. In the first quarter of 1996, the
Company entered into financial hedging futures contracts to offset a portion of
its North Sea crude. The Company will continue to consider other opportunities
in its risk management activities, such as swaps or fixed price contracts to
mitigate the adverse movement in oil and gas prices. Gains or losses on these
hedging activities are recognized in sales revenues when the underlying exposed
hedged production is sold. As of February 29, 1996, the Company had open
contracts for 600,000 barrels of oil at an average Brent price of $16.54 per
Bbl.
 
     The functional currency for translating the accounts of foreign
subsidiaries is the U.S. dollar, except for subsidiaries in the United Kingdom
where the functional currency is pounds sterling. The Company's revenues are
predominantly based upon the world market price for crude oil, which is
denominated in U.S. dollars. Certain operating costs, taxes, capital costs and
intercompany transactions represent commitments settled in foreign currencies.
Exchange rate fluctuations on transactions in currencies other than the
functional currency are recognized as gains and losses in current period income.
The Company periodically enters into foreign exchange contracts as a hedge
against fluctuations in foreign currency rates. These contracts are generally of
a short-term nature. At December 31, 1995, the Company had open contracts with a
net value of 21 million pounds sterling. However, there are foreign exchange
risks inherent in operations such as the Company's, and the Company cannot
predict with any certainty the results of currency exchange rate fluctuations.
 
     The Company also cannot predict with any degree of certainty the prices it
will receive in 1996 and future years for its crude oil, LNG, natural gas and
ethylene. In addition, uncertainty in the Middle East, policies of oil exporting
countries and worldwide demand for products affect the Company's sales. The
marketing of products and the prices the Company receives for such products are
sensitive to many factors beyond the control of the Company. The Company's
financial condition, operating results and liquidity may be materially affected
by any significant fluctuations in its sales prices. The Company's ability to
service its long-term obligations and to internally generate funds for capital
expenditures will be similarly affected. See Notes 13 and 17 of Notes to
Consolidated Financial Statements for information regarding the Company's
estimated proved reserves and sales.
 
     Likewise, the Company's business is affected by its costs and success in
finding, developing or acquiring new reserves to replace its reserves depleted
by production. Certain of the Company's producing properties are
 
                                       30
<PAGE>   33
 
at normal decline in production rates. In general, the Company's volume of
production from oil and gas properties declines with the passage of time. In
addition, the Company's participation share of gas volumes supplied to support
Indonesian LNG sales contract extensions or additions are and will be
significantly less than their participation share under the original long-term
sales contracts. The Company's long-term strategy is to increase its production
with successful exploration and development activities and selective reserve
acquisitions. There can be no assurances that the Company will achieve such
objectives. Except to the extent the Company conducts successful exploration,
exploitation or development activities, acquires additional properties
containing proved reserves or both, the proved reserves of the Company, and the
revenues generated from production thereof (assuming no price increases), will
decline as reserves are produced. Drilling activities are expensive and subject
to numerous risks, including the risk that no commercially viable oil or gas
production will be obtained. Also, the Company must compete with a substantial
number of other energy companies, any of which may have significantly greater
financial and other resources than the Company. Increases or decreases in prices
of oil and gas and in cost levels, along with the timing of development
projects, will also affect revenues generated by the Company and the present
value of estimated future net cash flows from its properties. Revenues generated
from future activities of the Company are highly dependent upon the level of
success in finding, developing or acquiring additional reserves. See Notes 1 and
17 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.
 
     The Company's overseas operations are subject to certain risks, including
expropriation of assets, governmental reinterpretation of applicable law and
contract terms, increases in taxes and government royalties, renegotiation of
contracts with foreign governments or customers, foreign government approvals of
lease, permit or similar applications and of exploration and production plans,
political and economic instability, disputes between governments, exclusive
jurisdiction of foreign courts, payment delays, export restrictions, increased
environmental regulations, limits on allowable levels of exploration and
production and currency exchange losses and repatriation restrictions, as well
as changes in laws and policies governing operations of companies with overseas
operations generally. Foreign operations and investments may also be subject to
laws and policies of the United States affecting foreign trade, investment and
taxation that could affect the conduct and profitability of these operations.
 
     All of the Company's activities are subject to the risks normally
associated with exploration for and production of oil and gas as well as the
production of petrochemicals. Also, the Company's activities are subject to
stringent environmental regulations. The Company believes that its operations
and facilities are in general compliance with existing environmental
regulations. Nevertheless, the risks of substantive costs and liabilities are
inherent in operations such as the Company's, and there can be no assurance that
significant costs and liabilities will not be incurred in the future.
 
     The discussion of the Company's business and operations in this report
includes in several instances forward-looking statements, which are based upon
management's good faith assumptions relating to the financial, market, operating
and other relevant environments that will exist and affect the Company's
business and operations in the future. No assurance can be made that the
assumptions upon which management based its forward-looking statements will
prove to be correct, or that the Company's business and operations will not be
affected in any substantial manner by other factors not currently foreseeable by
management or beyond the Company's control. All forward-looking statements
involve risks and uncertainty, including those described in this report, and
such statements shall be deemed in the future to be modified in their entirety
by the Company's public pronouncements, including those contained in all future
reports and other documents filed by the Company with the Securities Exchange
Commission.

                       REPORT OF INDEPENDENT ACCOUNTANTS
 
To the Stockholders and Directors of
  Union Texas Petroleum Holdings, Inc.
 
In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements listed in the accompanying
index present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of Union
Texas Petroleum Holdings, Inc. and its subsidiaries at December 31, 1995 and
1994, and the results of their operations and their cash flows for each of the
three years in the period ended December 31, 1995, in conformity with generally
accepted accounting principles. These financial statements are the
responsibility of the Company's management; our responsibility is to express an
opinion on these financial statements based on our audits. We conducted our
audits of these statements in accordance with generally accepted auditing
standards which require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable
assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material
misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting
the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements, assessing the
accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, and
evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We believe that our
audits provide a reasonable basis for the opinion expressed above.
 
As discussed in Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company
changed its method of accounting for postemployment benefits in 1993.

               (DOLLARS IN THOUSANDS UNLESS OTHERWISE INDICATED)
 
NOTE 1 -- ORGANIZATION AND SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES
 
  Organization
 
     The Company is engaged in oil and gas exploration and production
principally overseas and petrochemical manufacturing in the United States.
International activities are conducted primarily in Indonesia, the United
Kingdom sector of the North Sea, Pakistan and other strategic areas. Two limited
partnerships (the "KKR Partnerships"), organized and controlled by an affiliate
of Kohlberg Kravis Roberts & Co. ("KKR"), own approximately 25% of the Company's
issued and outstanding common stock.
 
     At the 1995 Annual Meeting of Stockholders held May 10, 1995, the Company's
stockholders approved the authorization of a new class of 15 million shares of
preferred stock. The new unissued preferred stock provides the Company
additional financing flexibility to issue from time to time based on current
market conditions.
 
  Principles of consolidation
 
     The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Union Texas
Petroleum Holdings, Inc. ("UTPH"), its wholly owned subsidiaries and
proportionate interests in the assets, liabilities and operations of
unincorporated joint ventures (referred to herein individually and collectively
as the "Company"). Investments in which the Company has between a 20% to 50%
ownership interest are accounted for using the equity method. All material
intercompany transactions are eliminated.
 
  Use of estimates
 
     The consolidated financial statements are prepared in conformity with
general accepted accounting principles which requires management to make certain
estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of certain assets and
liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of
the financial statements and the related reported amounts of revenues and
expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those
estimates. Management believes that the estimates are reasonable.
 
  Inventories
 
     Finished product inventories are valued at the lower of cost or market
using the last-in, first-out method ("LIFO"). Materials and supplies inventories
are valued at the lower of average cost or market.
 
  Property, plant and equipment
 
     Oil and gas exploration and production activities are accounted for
employing the successful efforts method. Under this method, costs of successful
exploratory wells, development wells and acreage are capitalized. Costs of
unsuccessful exploratory wells are expensed upon the determination that the well
does not justify commercial development. Other exploration costs including
geological and geophysical costs in exploration areas, delay rentals, production
costs and overhead are charged to expense as incurred.
 
     Major renewals and improvements are capitalized, and the assets replaced
are retired. Maintenance and repairs are expensed as incurred.
 
     Depreciation, depletion and amortization of the capitalized costs of
producing properties, both tangible and intangible, are provided for on the
units-of-production basis. Unit-of-production rates are based on estimated
recoverable oil and gas reserves. Amortization of undeveloped acreage from date
of acquisition is based upon such factors as lease term, estimated evaluation
period and prior experience. The Company reviews its leases and related
amortization rates periodically.

           NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS -- (CONTINUED)
               (DOLLARS IN THOUSANDS UNLESS OTHERWISE INDICATED)
 
     Estimated dismantlement, restoration and abandonment costs net of estimated
salvage value are taken into account in determining amortization. Depreciable
assets other than oil and gas properties are depreciated using the straight-line
method based on estimated asset service lives from 5 to 31 years.
 
  Postemployment benefits
 
     In December 1992, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ("FASB")
released Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 112, "Employers'
Accounting for Postemployment Benefits," which concluded that the estimated cost
of benefits provided by an employer to former or inactive employees after
employment but before retirement represents part of the compensation provided to
an employee in exchange for service. The Company currently provides certain
long-term benefits to disabled employees. The Company adopted the Statement
effective January 1, 1993, by recording a cumulative charge to net income of
approximately $4 million representing the estimated future obligation for those
employees currently under the long-term disability program. In prior periods,
the Company's cost of long-term disability was expensed as paid.
 
  Impairment of long-lived assets
 
     In March 1995, the FASB released Statement of Financial Accounting
Standards No. 121, "Accounting for the Impairment of Long-Lived Assets and for
Long-Lived Assets to Be Disposed Of," which concluded long-lived assets should
be reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate
that the carrying value of an asset may not be recoverable. The Company has
adopted the pronouncement which had no impact on the financial position of the
Company.
 
  Foreign currency
 
     The functional currency for translating the accounts of foreign
subsidiaries is the U.S. dollar, except for subsidiaries in the United Kingdom,
where the functional currency is the local currency. Translation adjustments of
this local currency, which represent unrealized increases and decreases in the
Company's net investment in foreign operations as the result of exchange rate
changes, are included in stockholders' equity as the cumulative foreign exchange
translation adjustment. Transaction gains and losses resulting from the effect
of exchange rate fluctuations on transactions in currencies other than the
functional currency are included in determining net income. Foreign exchange
gains (losses) included in the determination of net income for the years 1995,
1994, and 1993 were ($768), ($178) and $492, respectively.
 
  Foreign exchange contracts
 
     The Company periodically enters into foreign exchange contracts as a hedge
against fluctuations in foreign currency rates. For contracts that hedge
specific transactions, market value gains and losses are deferred and recognized
as a component of cost of the transaction upon consummation. For contracts that
hedge economic exposures, market value gains and losses are recognized in the
period in which they occur.
 
  Other
 
     The fair value of financial instruments included in the Company's assets
and liabilities approximates carrying value. Cash equivalents are comprised of
highly liquid debt instruments purchased at a maturity of three months or less.

NOTE 2 -- PIPER FIELD WRITE-DOWN
 
     In 1993, as a result of the crude oil price environment, it was determined
that estimated future net pretax cash flows from the U.K. Piper field did not
exceed capitalized costs of the field, and accordingly, the Company recorded a
$103 million pretax, non-cash charge to depreciation, depletion and
amortization. After including the reversal of $55 million of related U.K.
deferred income taxes, the net income impact of the charge was $48 million.
 
NOTE 3 -- ACCOUNTS AND NOTES RECEIVABLE
 
     At December 31, 1995 and 1994, accounts and notes receivable consisted of

companies, industrial users and joint venture partners. Those receivables
considered a significant credit risk are backed by letters of credit. Typically,
credit terms are of a short-term nature.

     In 1994, the Company acquired a 9.42% unit interest from Fina Exploration
Limited and Fina Petroleum Development Limited, subsidiaries of Petrofina SA
(collectively, "Fina") in two blocks in the undeveloped Britannia natural gas
and condensate field in the U.K. North Sea for 101 million pounds sterling ($159
million). Production from Britannia is planned to begin in late 1998. The
Company increased oil and gas properties and equipment by $219 million, the sum
of the purchase price of $159 million, and a deferred tax payable of $60 million
arising from the purchase. The purchase was financed with debt.
 
     On July 18, 1995, the Company, through its subsidiary, Union Texas
Petroleum Limited ("UTPL"), acquired from Oryx UK Energy Company ("Oryx") their
15.5% working interest in Block 16/26 in the central United Kingdom North Sea,
which includes the Alba field. UTPL paid Oryx $270 million for the interest. The
effective date of the transaction was July 1, 1995. The Company funded the
acquisition under its bank credit facilities and its uncommitted and unsecured
lines of credit. The Company increased plant, property and equipment by $328
million, the sum of the purchase price of $270 million and a deferred tax
payable of $58 million arising from the purchase.

  Credit Facilities
 
     The Company had three unsecured credit facilities (the "Credit Facilities")
at December 31, 1995. One of the Credit Facilities is a $100 million unsecured
credit agreement with a syndicate of banks, that provides for conversion of
amounts outstanding on April 15, 1996 to a one-year term loan maturing April 15,
1997. Another Credit Facility is a $450 million unsecured credit agreement with
a syndicate of banks that provides for a quarterly reduction of $35 million
beginning July 31, 1998, with a final maturity of April 30, 1999. The $450
million revolver allows the Company to obtain up to $300 million of availability
thereunder in U.S. dollar loans that bear interest at a rate determined in a
competitive bid process. Loans under the $450 million revolver may be made in
both pounds sterling and U.S. dollars at the option of the Company. In June
1995, the Company entered into an additional $100 million unsecured credit
agreement with certain banks. This $100 million revolver providing for
conversion of amounts outstanding on June 15, 1996 to a one-year term loan
maturing June 15, 1997 was terminated January 31, 1996. Loans under the Credit
Facilities bear interest at floating market rates based on, at the Company's
option, the agent bank's base rate or LIBOR, plus applicable margins, subject to
increase in certain events. The Credit Facilities contain restrictive covenants,
including maintenance of certain coverage ratios related to the incurrence of
additional indebtedness and limitations on asset sales and mergers or
consolidations. The covenants also require maintenance of stockholders' equity,
as adjusted, of $350 million. At December 31, 1995, $132 million was outstanding
under the $450 million revolver bearing interest at a weighted average rate of
6.17% per annum. The Credit Facilities provide the Company with the ability to
borrow on a long-term basis, and as it is the Company's intent to do so, such
borrowings are classified as long-term.
 
  Senior Notes
 
     In March 1995, the Company publicly issued $125 million principal amount of
8 3/8% Senior Notes due 2005 (the "8 3/8% Senior Notes") at an initial public
offering price of 99.431%. In April 1995, the Company publicly issued $75
million principal amount of 8 1/2% Senior Notes due 2007 (the "8 1/2% Senior
Notes") at an initial public offering price of 99.658%. The net proceeds from
the sale of the 8 3/8% Senior Notes and the 8 1/2% Senior Notes were
approximately $123.5 million and $74.2 million, respectively (after deducting
underwriting discount, commissions and offering expenses). The Company used such
proceeds to reduce debt under its existing credit facility and its uncommitted
and unsecured lines of credit. The Company's $100 million

principal amount of 8.25% Senior Notes due 1999 ("the 8.25% Senior Notes")
discussed below together with the 8 1/2% Senior Notes and the 8 3/8% Senior
Notes are referred to herein as the "Senior Notes."
 
     In November 1992, the Company sold $100 million principal amount, at an
initial offering price of 99.424%, of 8.25% Senior Notes for approximately $98
million (after deducting underwriting discounts, commission and offering
expenses). The Company used such proceeds to reduce then outstanding debt under
its credit facility. The Senior Notes represent general unsecured obligations of
the Company and rank pari passu in right of payment with the Company's
obligations under its Credit Facilities and senior in right of payment to any
future subordinated indebtedness of the Company. Each of the Senior Notes
contain similar restrictive covenants. The Senior Notes are redeemable at any
time, at the option of the Company, in whole or in part, at a price equal to
100% of the principal amount plus accrued interest plus a make-whole premium
relating to the then-prevailing Treasury Yield and the remaining life of the
Senior Notes.
 
  Medium Term Notes
 
     During 1995, the Company issued $100 million aggregate principal amount of
medium term notes ("MTN") with terms of seven and twelve years and interest
rates varying from 6.51% to 6.81%. The net proceeds from the sale of the MTN
were approximately $99.4 million and were used to reduce debt under the
Company's credit facility and its uncommitted and unsecured lines of credit.
These MTN represent general unsecured obligations of the Company and rank pari
passu in right of payment with the Company's obligations under its Credit
Facilities and Senior Notes and senior in right of payment to any future
subordinated indebtedness of the Company. Each of the MTN contain similar
restrictive covenants as the Senior Notes. The MTN are redeemable at any time,
at the option of the Company, in whole or in part, at a price equal to 100% of
the principal amount plus accrued interest plus a make-whole premium relating to
the then-prevailing Treasury Yield and the remaining life of the MTN.
 
  Britannia Financing
 
     The Company's indirect subsidiary, Union Texas Britannia Limited ("UTBL"),
which is a wholly owned subsidiary of UTPL, has a 150 million pounds sterling
secured financing from a syndicate of banks. The financing is used to fund the
Company's share of the cost of developing the Britannia field to production
(including interest and other financing costs incurred prior to completion and
potential cost overruns), and any remaining availability after completion may,
subject to certain coverage ratios being met, be used for UTBL's general
corporate purposes. Except for certain support by UTPL related to any potential
cost overruns in excess of the facility amount (limited to 30 million pounds
sterling), insurance, tax benefits and administrative services, the lenders'
recourse will be limited to the Britannia field project assets and is
nonrecourse to the Company. The financing has a final maturity in September
2005. At December 31, 1995, 19 million pounds sterling ($29 million) was
outstanding under UTBL's financing.
 
  Subsidiary Production Loan
 
     Union Texas Pakistan, Inc., a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company, has a
nonrecourse loan, payable from production proceeds, which will be repaid in
semiannual installments of $1,146 through 1997, and bears interest at the
182-day Treasury bill rate plus 1.0%. At December 31, 1995, such interest rate
was 6.64%.
 
  Money Market Lines of Credit
 
     Due to the Company's ability to obtain favorable interest rates on
short-term borrowings, uncommitted and unsecured lines of credit were
established with several banks in both U.S. dollars and pounds sterling. These
money market borrowings, which have a short-term maturity, have been classified
as long-term debt based on the Company's intent to refinance these borrowings
for a period exceeding one year and the ability to refinance them on a long-term
basis through its Credit Facilities. At December 31, 1995 and 1994,
 
                                       43

$148 million and $106 million, respectively, were outstanding under these money
market lines which bore interest at weighted average rates of 6.5% and 6.46% per
annum, respectively. At December 31, 1995, the Company has adjusted the 1994
balance sheet by reclassifying outstanding money market borrowings of $106
million from current liabilities to long-term debt. Management believes that
this presentation is more meaningful for comparative analysis and appropriately
reflects management's intent at December 31, 1994.
 
     Interest capitalized for the years 1995, 1994, and 1993 was $23,081,
$18,774, and $25,674, respectively.
 
     Scheduled maturities of long-term debt outstanding during the five years
1996 through 2000 are $2,292, $2,290, $0, $395,933 and $13,909, respectively.

     A deferred tax liability or asset is recorded for future tax consequences
arising from differences between the financial accounting and tax basis of the
assets and liabilities of the Company. An impairment evaluation, with reserves
recorded as necessary for any tax benefit not expected to be realized, is
required of deferred tax assets. Deferred tax liabilities or assets are adjusted
for changes in income tax laws or rates when enacted. Deferred tax expense or
benefit is derived from changes in deferred tax liabilities or assets. A current
tax expense or benefit is recognized for the estimated taxes payable or
refundable on tax returns for the current year.
 
     Under the corporate alternative minimum tax ("AMT"), the Company's U.S. tax
liability is the greater of its regular tax or the AMT. To the extent that the
Company's AMT liability exceeds its otherwise determined tax liability, an AMT
credit may be generated and this credit may be applied against future tax
liabilities.
 
     The principal items accounting for the difference in taxes on income
computed at the United States statutory rate and as recorded are as follows:

NOTE 9 -- PENSION BENEFITS
 
     The Union Texas Petroleum Salaried Employees' Pension Plan (the "Pension
Plan") covers substantially all employees. Plan benefits are generally based on
years of service and an employee's compensation levels during the last years of
employment. The Company's funding policy is to contribute annually an amount at
least equal to the minimum funding requirement of the Employee Retirement Income
Security Act of 1974.
 
     The Union Texas Petroleum Supplemental Retirement Plans ("Supplemental
Retirement Plans") cover certain employees whose pension benefits were affected
by changes in the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, and certain other
benefit limitations of the Internal Revenue Code. The supplemental plans are
unfunded.
 
     The Pension Plan has assets in excess of the projected benefit obligation
for 1995. The assets of this plan are held by trustees and are invested in
common stock, fixed rate and real estate investments. The following table sets
forth the plans' funded status at December 31, 1995 and 1994:

     Settlement losses resulted from certain lump sum payments to employees who
terminated from participation in the Supplemental Retirement Plans during the
year.
 
     The assumed average rate of return on plan assets was 8% in 1995, 1994 and
1993 for the plans. Measurement of the projected benefit obligation was based on
an assumed discount rate of 7.25% and 7% in 1995, 8.5% and 7% in 1994 and 7.5%
and 7% in 1993 for normal and lump sum eligible participants, respectively, for
the Pension and Supplemental Retirement Plans and an assumed long-term rate of
compensation increase of 4.5%, 4.5% and 5% for the Pension and Supplemental
Retirement Plans in 1995, 1994 and 1993, respectively.
 
NOTE 10 -- OTHER POSTRETIREMENT BENEFITS
 
     The Company currently provides postretirement benefits, principally health
care and life insurance benefits, for employees. Under the Company's current
policy, substantially all of the Company's employees may become eligible for
those benefits if they reach normal retirement age with ten years of service
while working for the Company. These benefits are unfunded.
 
     The following table sets forth the plan's status at December 31:

     Measurement of the accumulated postretirement benefit obligation was based
on an assumed discount rate of 7.25% for 1995, 8.5% for 1994 and 7.5% for 1993.
For measurement purposes, a 12%, 12.75% and 13.5% annual rate of increase in the
per capita cost of covered health care benefits for those age 65 and older were
assumed for 1995, 1994 and 1993, respectively; the rate was assumed to decrease
linearly to 6% for 2003 and after. The health care cost trend rate assumption
has a significant effect on the amounts reported. Increasing the assumed health
care cost trend rates by 1% in each year would increase the accumulated
postretirement benefit obligation as of December 31, 1995 and 1994, by $1,988
and $1,451, respectively. Additionally, it would increase the aggregate of the
service and interest cost components of net periodic postretirement benefit cost
for the years ended December 31, 1995, 1994 and 1993 by $216, $176 and $151,
respectively.

     In October 1995, the Financial Accounting Standards Board released
Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 123, "Accounting for Stock-Based
Compensation," which establishes financial and reporting standards for stock
based employee compensation plans that will be effective for the Company's 1996
financial statements. The statement encourages, but does not require, companies
to adopt a fair value based method of accounting for such plans in place of
current accounting standards. Companies electing to continue to use their
existing accounting methods will be required to make pro forma disclosures of
net income assuming a fair value based method of accounting has been applied.
The Company is evaluating the Statement as to whether to adopt the fair value
based method of accounting or continue using its current accounting methods with
additional disclosures.

NOTE 14 -- COMMITMENTS
 
     The Company has entered into various commitments and operating agreements
related to the development of and production from certain proved oil and gas
properties. Also during the normal course of business, the Company has issued
various letters of credit, bank guarantees and performance bonds, which at
December 31, 1995, totaled $8 million. At December 31, 1995, the Company had
open foreign exchange contracts with a net value of 21 million pounds sterling.
These contracts hedge economic exposures, based on the Company's assessment of
its net exposure to changes in foreign currency rates. It is management's belief
that such commitments and guarantees will be met without material adverse effect
on the Company's financial position.
 
     The amounts of operating lease obligations due during the five years 1996
through 2000 are $8,042, $7,866, $7,732, $7,641 and $7,050, respectively.
 
     Rental expense for the years 1995, 1994 and 1993 was $9,379, $9,520 and
$8,339, respectively.
 
NOTE 15 -- CONTINGENCIES
 
     The Company and its subsidiaries and related companies are named defendants
in a number of lawsuits and named parties in numerous governmental proceedings
arising in the ordinary course of business.
 
     While the outcome of such contingencies, lawsuits or other proceedings
against the Company cannot be predicted with certainty, management expects that
such liability, to the extent not provided for through insurance or otherwise,
will not have a material adverse effect on the financial statements of the
Company.

NOTE 17 -- SUPPLEMENTARY OIL AND GAS INFORMATION
 
  Reserve estimation -- (Unaudited)
 
     Oil and gas reserves cannot be measured exactly. Reserve estimates are
based on many factors related to reservoir performance which require evaluation
by the engineers interpreting the available data, as well as price, costs and
other economic factors. The reliability of these estimates at any point in time
depends on both the quality and quantity of the technical and economic data, the
production performance of the reservoirs as well as extensive engineering
judgment. Consequently, reserve estimates are subject to revision as additional
data becomes available during the producing life of a reservoir. When a
commercial reservoir is discovered,

           NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS -- (CONTINUED)
               (DOLLARS IN THOUSANDS UNLESS OTHERWISE INDICATED)
 
proved reserves are initially determined based on only limited data from the
first well or wells. Further drilling may better define the extent of the
reservoir and additional production performance, well tests and engineering
studies will likely improve the reliability of the estimate.
 
     Reserves are considered proved if economic producibility is supported by
either actual production or conclusive formation tests. Proved developed
reserves are reserves that can be expected to be recovered through existing
wells with existing equipment and operating methods. Proved undeveloped reserves
are reserves that are expected to be recovered from new wells on undrilled
acreage or from existing wells where a relatively significant expenditure is
required to permit production. These estimates do not include reserves which may
be found by extension of proved areas or reserves recoverable by secondary or
tertiary recovery methods unless these methods are in operation and showing
successful results.
 
     In 1995, the Company purchased an interest in the Alba field in the U.K.
North Sea, adding at July 1, 1995, 45 million barrels of oil equivalent ("boe").
 
     In 1994, the Company purchased an interest in the undeveloped Britannia
field in the U.K. North Sea, adding at year end 1994, 38 million boe to its
proved reserves.
 
     Information presented for the Company's operations in Indonesia relates to
a production sharing contract between a joint venture group in which the Company
is a member and Pertamina. Debt service relating to the Indonesian facility
which liquefies natural gas supplied by the joint venture and other production
sharing contractors is accounted for by the Company as a cost of production and
operation. The debt obligation is non-recourse to the Company. Such debt service
is deducted in estimating future net revenues to be distributed among Pertamina
and the production sharing contractors including the joint venture and the
Company's interest therein. The joint venture has no ownership interest in the
oil and gas reserves but does have the right to share revenues and/or production
and is entitled to recover most field and other operating costs and capital
depreciation. The reserve estimates, which are based on year-end prices, are
subject to revision as product prices and costs fluctuate due to the cost
recovery feature under the production sharing contract and due to the effect
that price fluctuations generally have on reserve estimates. The impact on
reserves is inversely related to price changes and directly related to changes
in field operating and capital costs. Indonesian reserves associated with the
Unimar partnership are shown under the caption "Non-Consolidated Interests."
 
     Prior to 1993, the Company included in its reported estimates of proved
reserves attributable to its interest in the Indonesian joint venture only those
proved reserves that were committed to be sold under LNG sales contracts or
which the Company expected to be sold in the spot market. Over the past several
years, the Indonesian joint venture experienced better than anticipated field
performance and development drilling successes. Also, Pertamina made progress in
marketing additional LNG volumes that the Company believes will be sold. As a
result, beginning in 1993, the Company booked upward revisions of proved
reserves attributable to its interest in this joint venture.
 
     "Other International" represents an interest in Egypt.

     The standardized measure data includes estimates of oil and gas reserve
volumes and forecasts of future production rates over the reserve lives.
Estimates of future production expenditures, including taxes and future
development costs, are based on management's best estimate of such costs
assuming a continuation of current economic and operating conditions. No
provision is included for depletion, depreciation and amortization of property
acquisition costs or indirect costs. The sales prices used in the calculation
are the year-end prices of crude oil, including condensate and natural gas
liquids, and natural gas which as of December 31, 1995, were $18.53 per barrel
of U.K. crude oil (Flotta) and $2.85 per Mcf (at the plant inlet) of Indonesian
LNG. Because of the estimated nature of the data presented, changes in price and
cost levels, as well as the timing of future development costs, may have a
significant impact on such data and cause such data not to be representative of
production or cash flows the Company may realize in the future.

effective January 1, 1993 (the "Plan") for the benefit of their eligible

         WHEREAS, the Company desires to amend the Plan on behalf of itself and
the Employing Companies;

         NOW, THEREFORE, the Plan shall be amended as follows, effective as of

         in Paragraph (a) above), effective as of the first day of any month,
         in accordance with the procedures and within the time period
         prescribed by the Committee."

         4.      Section 3.1(c) shall be amended by deleting the last sentence

         "Notwithstanding the foregoing, if a Fund is invested in shares of an

         be adjusted to the extent necessary to correspond with such mutual
         fund's net income (or net loss) allocation procedure.  As soon as is
         practical after the end of each month, the Trustee shall deliver to
         the Committee a written statement of such determination as of the last
         Valuation Date in the month."

         Accounts (other than Company Contributions) shall be invested from
         among the Funds made available from time to time by the Committee.
         One of such Funds shall be an unsegregated fund invested in Company
         Stock entitled the "Union Texas Petroleum Stock Fund."  Pending
         selection and purchase of the types of investments provided by a Fund,
         contributions to a Fund may be invested in obligations of the United
         States of America or in any short-term investments such as commercial
         paper or certificates of deposit, or in a commingled, collective or
         common trust fund consisting of such investments.  With respect to
         each of a Member's Accounts, such Member may designate one of such
         Funds for all the amounts allocated to such Account or he may split
         the investment of the amounts allocated to such Account between such
         Funds in such increments as the Committee may prescribe; provided,
         however, that Company Contributions shall be invested in accordance
         with the provisions of Section 5.2."

         9.      Section 5.3 of the Plan shall be deleted and the following
shall be substituted therefor:

         contributions to be allocated to any one or all of his Accounts,
         subject to the limitations of Section 5.1.  Any such change shall be
         made in accordance with the procedures established by the Committee,
         and the frequency of such changes may be limited by the Committee.

<PAGE>   3
                 (b)  Subject to the provisions of this Paragraph, a Member may
         elect to convert his investment designation with respect to the
         amounts already allocated to one or more of his Accounts.  Any such
         conversion shall be made in accordance with the procedures established
         by the Committee, and the frequency of such conversion may be limited
         by the Committee.  Amounts in the Union Texas Petroleum Stock Fund
         attributable to Company Contributions allocated to such Fund after
         September 30, 1987 may not be transferred unless the Member is age 55
         or older."

         10.     Section 5.4(a) shall be amended by deleting the last sentence
of such Section and the following shall be substituted therefor:

         "In the event that treasury or authorized but unissued shares of
         Company Stock are purchased by the Trustee from Union Texas Petroleum
         Holdings, Inc., the price per share shall be the closing price of the
         Company Stock reported on the New York Stock Exchange for the date of
         purchase or, if no sale occurred on such date, for the next preceding
         day on which a sale occurred."

         11.     Section 5.4(b) of the Plan shall be deleted and the following
shall be substituted therefor:

         "(b)    For purposes of crediting contributions invested in the Union
         Texas Petroleum Stock Fund, the credit shall be based on the cost per
         share (including brokerage fees and transfer fees) of Company Stock
         purchased by the Trustee for all Members for the Valuation Date for
         which the contributions were made, and for this purpose contributions
         of shares of Company Stock shall be valued at the closing price of
         such stock reported on the New York Stock Exchange for the date of
         contribution, or, if no sale occurred on such date, for the next
         preceding day on which a sale occurred."

         such terminated Member occurs if such Member was not reemployed by the

         of his death."

         excess of his Vested Interest in such Account.

                 (c)  A Member who has withdrawn all amounts in his Member
         Contribution Account and Rollover Account and who has contributed to
         or had Cash or Deferred Contributions made on his behalf to the Plan

<PAGE>   5
                 (d)  Withdrawals from a Member's Company Contribution Account
         shall be considered to come, first, from the Member's Vested Interest
         in the portion of his Company Contribution Account attributable to
         Company Contributions allocated on or before September 30, 1987, and,
         second, from the Member's Vested Interest in the portion of his

         allocated after September 30, 1987.

                 (e)  A Member who has attained age fifty-nine and one-half,
         who has withdrawn all amounts in his Member Contribution Account,
         Rollover Account and Company Contribution Account and who has
         contributed to or had  Cash or Deferred Contributions made to the Plan
         on his behalf for at least sixty cumulative  months may withdraw from
         his Cash or Deferred Account an amount not exceeding the then value of
         such Account.  A Member who makes such a withdrawal may not again make
         Cash or Deferred Contributions to the Plan for a period of six months
         following such withdrawal."

         21.     Section 11.1(g) shall be amended by deleting from the first

         the contrary herein notwithstanding, the Committee may in its
         discretion provide that, during and for the duration of any period of
         transition as a result of a change of Trustees and as necessary to
         ensure an orderly transition, (1) no distributions, withdrawals,
         loans, execution of, change to, or revocation of a Compensation
         reduction agreement, change of investment designation of future
         contributions or transfer of amounts in Accounts from one Fund to
         another Fund, or other Plan activity shall be permitted, or (2) any
         such Plan activity shall be limited or restricted; provided that any
         such temporary cessation, limitation, or restriction of Plan activity
         shall be in compliance with all applicable law."

         Trustee in such Fund or Funds, in such increments as the Committee may
         prescribe, in accordance with directions obtained from Members at the
         time of the receipt of such proceeds, which directives shall be
         independent of the investment directions made by the Member pursuant
         to Sections 5.1 and 5.3 hereof.  If timely investment direction is not
         received from a Member, such Member's interest in such cash proceeds
         shall be invested in the Fund selected by the Committee."

         26.     Effective as of January 1, 1995, Section 11.1(f)(3) shall be
deleted and the following shall be substituted therefor:

                 pounds per square inch gauge (42.5 psig) at the Delivery
                 Point. In any event, pressure at the Delivery Point shall not
                 exceed one hundred twenty pounds per square inch gauge (120
                 psig).
<PAGE>   15
         (c)     Loading Port facilities shall include:

                 (i)      Shore tanks and loading lines for liquid nitrogen,
                          and pipelines and connections for the supply of fresh
                          water; and

                 (ii)     Appropriate systems necessary for radio and telex
                          communications with the LNG Tankers.

4.4      Loading Port Obligations

         (a)     LNG Tankers shall utilize the Loading Port facilities subject
                 to observance of all relevant port regulations. Any tugs,
                 pilots or escort vessels required (or other support vessels
                 required in connection with the safe berthing of an LNG
                 Tanker) shall be employed at the sole risk and expense of the
                 LNG Tanker. Prior to each loading, Buyers' Transporter shall
                 be responsible for determining the availability of any
                 nitrogen, fuel, water and other utilities required by the LNG
                 Tankers at the Loading Port, which will be provided by Seller
                 on an as available basis for Buyers' Transporter's account.

         (b)     Buyers and/or Buyers' Transporter shall be responsible for
                 payment of amounts due for supplies and services requested by
                 masters of LNG Tankers and for normal port charges to the
                 extent such charges are uniformly applied to all LNG vessels
                 receiving exports of LNG from the Loading Port.

4.5      Cargo Loading

         (a)     The LNG to be sold and purchased hereunder shall be pumped
                 into LNG Tankers at the expense of Seller through manifold
                 strainers of sixty (60) mesh (or such other mesh as shall be
                 agreed from time to time by the parties) provided by the LNG
                 Tanker and, absent agreement of the parties or an unavoidable
                 circumstance, shall be in full cargo lots.

         (b)     The loading facilities provided by Seller shall include a
                 boil-off gas return system for receiving boil-off gas from LNG
                 Tankers. There shall be no charge for any natural gas
                 boiled-off from the LNG Tankers while berthed at the Loading
                 Port that is returned to shore. The LNG Tankers shall compress
                 such boil-off gas to the extent required to maintain the gas
                 pressure in the LNG Tanker's cargo tanks and the boil-off gas
                 return line within allowable operating limits during loading,
                 and Seller shall operate the boil-off gas return system in a
                 manner that will permit the gas pressure in the LNG Tanker's
                 cargo tanks to be maintained within the allowable operating
                 limits of such tanks.

4.6      Notifications of Estimated Time of Arrival at Loading Port and Cooling
         Requirements

         (a)     Buyers shall give Seller notice by telex or facsimile of the
                 date and hour on which each LNG Tanker departs from an
                 Unloading Port or drydock/repair port and the estimated time
                 of arrival ("ETA") at the Loading Port. Said notice shall be
                 submitted immediately after the LNG Tanker's departure from
                 the Unloading Port or drydock/repair port. Buyers shall
                 include in such notice to Seller a statement of:

                 (i)      The estimated quantity of LNG that will be required
                          to cool the tanks to permit continuous loading of LNG
                          and the estimated time that will be required for such
                          cooling, both of which will be based upon the date
                          the LNG Tanker is expected to commence loading;

                 (ii)     Any operational deficiencies in the LNG Tanker that
                          may affect its port performance; and

                 (iii)    Requirements for nitrogen, fuel, water and other
                          utilities.
      
                          Buyers shall arrange for the LNG Tanker's master to
                          notify Seller regarding any change in the ETA of
                          twelve (12) hours or more. If the LNG Tanker's cargo
                          tanks should require cooling or if the cooling or
                          utilities requirements or the condition of the LNG
                          Tanker should change on account of circumstances
                          discovered after transmittal of the notice required
                          by this Section 4.6(a), the master of the LNG Tanker
                          shall give prompt notice thereof to Seller, setting
                          forth the information required by the second
                          preceding sentence, or amending any such information
                          previously given to Seller.

         (b)     Seventy-two (72) hours prior to the LNG Tanker's arrival at
                 the Loading Port, the LNG Tanker's master shall give notice by
                 telex to Seller stating its then ETA. If this ETA should
                 change by more than six (6) hours, the LNG Tanker's master
                 shall give notice of the corrected ETA promptly to Seller.
<PAGE>   17
         (c)     Forty-eight (48) hours prior to the LNG Tanker's arrival at
                 the Loading Port, the LNG Tanker's master shall give notice by
                 telex to Seller confirming or amending the last ETA notice. If
                 this ETA changes by more than six (6) hours, the LNG Tanker's
                 master shall give notice of the corrected ETA promptly to
                 Seller.

         (d)     Twenty-four (24) hours prior to the LNG Tanker's arrival at
                 the Loading Port, an ETA notice shall be sent by telex and
                 radio to Seller confirming or amending the last ETA notice. If
                 this ETA changes by more than two (2) hours, the LNG Tanker's
                 master shall give notice of the corrected ETA promptly to
                 Seller.

         (e)     A final ETA notice shall be sent by telex and radio five (5)
                 hours prior to the LNG Tanker's arrival at the Loading Port.

4.7      Berthing Assignments
         Seller shall determine the berthing sequence of vessels at the Loading
         Port in order to best ensure compliance with the overall loading
         schedule of the Badak Facility (including the Annual Program and
         Ninety-Day Schedules hereunder), and shall notify the masters of LNG
         Tankers via the ship's agent of their berthing priority upon receipt
         of Notice of Readiness.

4.8      Vessels not Ready for Loading

         (a)     If an LNG Tanker arrives which is not ready to load for any
                 reason, Seller may or may not allow it to berth. In the case
                 of an LNG Tanker only requiring cooldown to be ready to load,
                 Seller shall not defer berthing by reason thereof if either
                 such cooldown was provided for in the most recent Ninety-Day
                 Schedule or the cooldown time is not expected to exceed six
                 (6) hours. Whenever Buyers notify Seller that an LNG Tanker
                 will require cooldown, Seller shall make provision therefor in
                 the Ninety-Day Schedule as soon as Seller can do so without
                 disrupting the overall loading schedule or operations of the
                 Badak Facility.

         (b)     If any LNG Tanker previously believed to be ready for loading
                 or cooling is found to be unready after being berthed, Seller
                 may direct the master to vacate the berth and proceed to
                 anchorage, whether or not other vessels are awaiting a berth,
                 unless it appears reasonably certain that the LNG Tanker at
                 the berth can be readied within four (4) hours and Seller has
                 not concluded that such LNG Tanker is unsafe.
<PAGE>   18
         (c)     When the LNG Tanker at anchorage is ready, the master will
                 notify Seller. Seller shall assign a berth to any such LNG
                 Tanker or to any LNG Tanker awaiting cooldown at anchorage as
                 soon as Seller is able to do so without disrupting Seller's
                 loading requirements or operations.

4.9      Notice of Readiness
         As soon as the LNG Tanker is securely moored at the berth or securely
         anchored awaiting a berth, has received all necessary port clearances
         and is able to receive LNG for loading or cooling, the master shall
         give notice of readiness to Seller ("Notice of Readiness"); provided,
         however, that in the event an LNG Tanker should arrive at the Loading
         Port prior to the date established in the Ninety-Day Schedule (and any
         revisions thereof except those made after the LNG Tanker has commenced
         its voyage to the Loading Port unless made as a result of delays
         caused by the operations of the LNG Tankers), Notice of Readiness
         shall be deemed effective at the earlier of (i) 0:00 a.m. local time
         on the scheduled loading date, or (ii) the time loading commences.

4.10     Tank Temperature for Loading and Statement of Cooling Time
         Buyers shall cause Buyers' Transporter after each discharge of a cargo
         at an Unloading Port to retain on board each LNG Tanker sufficient
         LNG, based on normal operations of the LNG Tanker (subject to making
         adequate provision for any LNG Tanker mechanical problems of which
         Buyers' Transporter is aware), to maintain, for a period of not less
         than twenty-four (24) hours after the later of (i) the actual arrival
         or (ii) the scheduled arrival date (ignoring any revision to such date
         made after the LNG Tanker has commenced its voyage to the Loading
         Port) of such LNG Tanker at the Loading Port, a temperature in the
         cargo tanks to permit continuous loading of LNG ("Arrival Temperature
         Requirement"); provided, however, that the Arrival Temperature
         Requirement shall not apply upon entry into service or in cases where
         the LNG Tanker proceeds from an Unloading Port to the Loading Port by
         way of a port at which either a drydock or significant repairs have
         been carried out. When an LNG Tanker requires cooling, the master or
         Buyers' Representative shall so inform Seller at the time of the first
         notice under Section 4.6(a) and, second, at the time of the Notice of
         Readiness. After the LNG Tanker has been cooled, the representatives
         of both Buyers and Seller shall sign a statement of cooling time
         ("Statement of Cooling Time").
<PAGE>   19
4.11     Quantities for Purging and Cooling of Tanks
         Quantities of LNG required to purge and cool each LNG Tanker to the
         temperature that will permit continuous loading of LNG shall be
         delivered by Seller without charge to Buyers upon the initial entry of
         such LNG Tanker into service and upon its return to service after each
         annual scheduled maintenance period (except that for a vessel
         temporarily in service as an LNG Tanker to receive such quantities of
         LNG without charge to Buyers, such vessel must remain in service for a
         period of not less than four (4) continuous months). All other LNG
         required by the LNG Tankers for purging and cooling shall be sold,
         delivered and invoiced by Seller and paid for by the Buyer (or its
         designee) scheduled to receive the cargo of LNG next to be loaded at
         the Contract Sales Price applicable to such cargo, except that where
         any LNG Tanker having met the Arrival Temperature Requirement needs
         purging or cooldown due to an event which does not extend Allotted
         Loading Time under Section 4.12(c), then the LNG required in
         connection therewith shall be provided without charge. Such price
         shall be applied to the total liquid quantities delivered for purging
         and cooling, measured before evaporation of any part thereof occurs.
         The parties will determine by mutual agreement the rates and pressures
         for delivery of LNG for purging and cooling and the method for
         determining quantities used for such operations. Quantities of LNG
         used to bring the LNG Tankers to a temperature permitting continuous
         loading of LNG shall not be applied against the quantities required to
         be sold by Seller and taken, or paid for if not taken, by Buyers under
         other provisions of this Contract.

4.12     Loading Time

         (a)     The allotted loading time for Seller to load each LNG Tanker
                 ("Allotted Loading Time") shall be twenty- four (24) hours,
                 subject to adjustment as provided below.

         (b)     The actual loading time for each LNG Tanker ("Actual Loading
                 Time") shall commence (i) six (6) hours after the time when
                 the Notice of Readiness is received or deemed to be effective,
                 as defined in Section 4.9, or (ii) when the LNG Tanker is "all
                 fast alongside" the berth and ready to receive cooldown LNG or
                 cargo, whichever first occurs, and shall end when the loading
                 and return lines of the LNG Tanker are disconnected from
                 Seller's loading and return lines and all cargo papers
                 necessary for departure required to be furnished by Seller are
                 delivered on board in proper form and the LNG Tanker is
                 permitted to proceed to sea.
<PAGE>   20
         (c)     Allotted Loading Time shall be extended to include:

                 (i)      The period during which proceeding from the
                          anchorage, berthing, loading or clearing of the LNG
                          Tanker to proceed to sea after completion of loading
                          is delayed, hindered or suspended by a Buyer, Buyers'
                          Transporter, LNG Tanker master, port authority or any
                          third party for reasons of safety, weather or
                          otherwise and over which Seller has no control;

                 (ii)     The period of any delays attributable to the
                          operation of an LNG Tanker, including the period of
                          time such LNG Tanker: (1) awaits a berth by reason of
                          the exercise by Seller of its rights under Section
                          4.8, or (2) receives LNG for purging and cooldown
                          (except when: (A) the LNG Tanker met the Arrival
                          Temperature Requirement and (B) the purging and
                          cooldown is not due to an event which extends
                          Allotted Loading Time under this Section 4.12(c));

                 (iii)    Any period during which berthing or loading of an LNG
                          Tanker is delayed, hindered or suspended by reason of
                          force majeure pursuant to Article 15 hereof; and

                 (iv)     Any period of delay caused by occupancy of the berth:

                          (A)     By a previous LNG Tanker, provided such
                                  occupancy is for reasons attributable to such
                                  LNG Tanker;

                          (B)     By either a previous LNG Tanker or another
                                  vessel on its scheduled loading date
                                  (ignoring any change in the schedule of the
                                  vessel occupying the berth made after
                                  departure of the LNG Tanker from the
                                  Unloading Port); or

                          (C)     By either a previous LNG Tanker or another
                                  vessel that arrived prior to the LNG Tanker
                                  when the LNG Tanker arrived after its
                                  scheduled loading date (ignoring any change
                                  in the LNG Tanker's scheduled loading date
                                  after departure of the LNG Tanker from the
                                  Unloading Port), except that there shall be
                                  no addition to Allotted Loading Time under
                                  this clause (C) either: (1) for any period in
                                  excess of twenty-four (24) hours or (2) if
                                  the LNG Tanker arrived more than twenty-four
                                  (24) hours prior to
<PAGE>   21
                                  0:00 a.m. local time on the scheduled loading
                                  date of the vessel occupying the berth
                                  (unless loading of such vessel was necessary
                                  in order to maintain production of the
                                  liquefaction facilities).

4.13     Demurrage

         (a)     Subject to paragraph (b) below, if Actual Loading Time exceeds
                 Allotted Loading Time (as extended in accordance with Section
                 4.12(c)) in loading any LNG Tanker ("Demurrage Event"), Seller
                 shall pay to Buyers demurrage at the daily rate (which shall
                 be prorated for a portion of a day) provided in Buyers'
                 Transportation Agreement, but not to exceed the daily
                 demurrage rate applicable under the 1973 LNG Sales Contract at
                 the time of the Demurrage Event.

         (b)     If a Demurrage Event occurs, the Buyer concerned shall take
                 such actions which are prudent and reasonable to prevent any
                 modification of the Ninety-Day Schedule and any other
                 unloading schedule at the Unloading Port to which the LNG
                 Tanker is bound, including appropriate direction of the LNG
                 Tanker.  In the event that the Demurrage Event causes the LNG
                 Tanker involved to be delayed in arriving at the Unloading
                 Port so that it is unable to commence unloading on the
                 scheduled unloading date (in effect at the time of the
                 Demurrage Event) or such delay requires the modification of
                 the date of commencement of unloading of any other LNG vessel,
                 any invoice from the Buyer concerned to Seller in accordance
                 with the provisions of Section 10.2 with respect to such
                 Demurrage Event shall remain in effect; otherwise, no payment
                 for the Demurrage Event shall be due and the Buyer concerned
                 shall notify Seller either that it is not invoicing Seller or
                 that it is canceling any invoice already submitted to Seller.

4.14     Effect of Loading Port Delays; Transportation Costs

         (a)     If an LNG Tanker is delayed in berthing and/or commencement of
                 loading for a reason which would not result in an extension of
                 Allotted Loading Time under Section 4.12(c), and if, as result
                 of such reason, the commencement of loading is delayed beyond
                 thirty (30) hours after Notice of Readiness has been given,
                 then, for each full hour by which commencement of loading is
                 delayed beyond such thirty- hour period, Seller shall pay
                 Buyer or its designee for boil-off during such delay at the
                 Contract Sales Price applicable to the cargo of LNG next to be
                 loaded. The hourly BTU boil-off rate to be applied for such
                 purpose
<PAGE>   22
                 shall be determined by actual average boil-off experience of
                 the LNG Tankers as determined at appropriate intervals, but
                 shall never exceed that quantity of LNG on board the LNG
                 Tanker at the commencement of the said thirty-hour period.
                 Buyers shall invoice Seller for amounts due under this Section
                 4.14(a) and Seller shall pay the invoice in accordance with
                 Article 10.

         (b)     If there should become due from Buyers to Buyers' Transporter
                 at any time any of the following:

                 (i)      Any payment or payments on account of non-utilization
                          of an LNG Tanker resulting from an event or
                          circumstance of force majeure affecting Seller caused
                          by an LNG vessel other than an LNG Tanker, which
                          payment or payments:

                          (A)     shall not exceed, on a daily basis, the daily
                                  demurrage rate provided in Section 4.13 for
                                  the first ninety (90) days;

                          (B)     shall be payable for any days in excess of
                                  one hundred eighty (180) days of such LNG
                                  Tanker non-utilization caused by such Seller
                                  force majeure at the rate provided in Buyers'
                                  Transportation Agreement; provided that,
                                  should Buyers' Transportation Agreement be
                                  terminated with respect to the LNG Tankers by
                                  reasons of such event of force majeure, the
                                  payment shall be equal to the termination
                                  payment provided for in Buyers'
                                  Transportation Agreement; and provided,
                                  further, that the basis for calculating all
                                  payments referred to in this clause (B) is
                                  reasonable when compared with the obligations
                                  of Seller under Seller's transportation
                                  arrangements entered into in support of its
                                  obligations under the 1973 LNG Sales Contract
                                  in the same circumstances; and

                          (C)     shall, in no event, exceed the maximum amount
                                  then available by way of P. and I. cover in
                                  respect of the LNG vessel causing the damage,
                                  and if amounts in respect of all damages
                                  resulting from the incident which would be
                                  recoverable by Seller from such P.  and I.
                                  cover exceed the maximum amount then
                                  available by way of P. and I. cover, then
                                  there shall be a proportionate reduction in
                                  the amount payable under this clause (i) so
                                  that such reduced
<PAGE>   23
                                  amount bears the same relationship to the
                                  maximum amount then available by way of P.
                                  and I. cover as the amount otherwise payable
                                  hereunder would bear to the total amount of
                                  Seller's damages resulting from the incident
                                  which are recoverable from such P. and I.
                                  cover; or

                 (ii)     Any payment or payments on account of Buyers' failure
                          to provide Buyers' Transporter with the minimum
                          quantities of LNG required under Buyers'
                          Transportation Agreement, if the deficiency is caused
                          by the failure of Seller to satisfy its obligations
                          under this Contract;

                          then, if and to the extent that the amount payable to
                          Buyers' Transporter has not been paid and is not
                          payable to Buyers under Section 4.13, such amount
                          shall be paid to Buyers by Seller.  This paragraph
                          (b) shall not require Seller to pay any amount which
                          becomes payable to Buyers' Transporter as the result
                          of an event or circumstance of force majeure
                          affecting Buyers, or as the result of Buyers' breach
                          of their obligations under this Contract. It is
                          understood that no amount will be payable by Seller
                          under this paragraph (b) by reason of non-utilization
                          of an LNG Tanker caused by the fault or negligence of
                          such LNG Tanker or Buyers' Transporter. Any payments
                          under this Section 4.14(b) shall be in such amounts
                          as reflect any credits to Buyers for other revenues
                          earned by the LNG Tanker during the period of force
                          majeure.

                          Buyers shall invoice Seller for payments under this
                          paragraph (b) and Seller shall pay those invoices in
                          accordance with Article 10.

         During each calendar year or portion thereof specified below (each
         such period being called a "Fixed Quantity Period"), Seller shall sell
         to each Buyer, and each Buyer shall purchase, receive and pay for, or
         pay for if not taken, at the Contract Sales Price, a quantity of LNG
         having a heating value as specified for such Buyer for such Fixed

The above Fixed Quantities are subject to adjustment as provided in Section
7.3(a). After giving effect to any such adjustment, the term "Fixed Quantity"
shall mean the applicable Fixed Quantity as so adjusted, and the respective
obligations of Seller to sell, and of each Buyer to purchase, receive and pay
for, or pay for if not taken, Fixed Quantities of LNG in any Fixed Quantity
Period shall apply to the applicable Fixed Quantities as so adjusted.

7.2       Reallocation of Cargoes; Rate of Deliveries

          (a)     Each Buyer, upon appropriate notice to Seller, may reallocate
                  all or part of an LNG Tanker cargo from one Buyer to another
                  Buyer.

                  In case of such reallocation, the ownership of such cargo or
                  part thereof shall be transferred directly from Seller to the
                  new Buyer in place of the original Buyer, but the respective
                  Fixed Quantities of the Buyers concerned shall not be changed
                  and the cargo in question shall be deemed to be received by
                  the original Buyer in connection with its take or pay
                  obligations under Section 7.3(a).
<PAGE>   27
                  Each such reallocation shall be documented in a form to be
                  established by Seller and Buyers, executed by the original
                  Buyer and the Buyer which will actually receive the cargo,
                  which document will provide that the receiving Buyer will
                  assume and be responsible to Seller for performance of the
                  obligations of the original Buyer in respect of such cargo,
                  and that such cargo is deemed to be taken by the original
                  Buyer in connection with its take or pay obligations under
                  Section 7.3(a).

                  Buyers will exercise the right to reallocate cargoes in a
                  manner that will not materially disrupt the shipping
                  schedules at the Badak Facility.

          (b)     Within each Fixed Quantity Period, the quantities to be
                  delivered by Seller and received by Buyers at the Badak
                  Facility shall be delivered and received at rates and
                  intervals which are reasonably constant over the course of
                  such Fixed Quantity Period, after taking into account all
                  commitments of the Badak Facility and taking into
                  consideration the downtime, shipping and other matters
                  referred to in Article 12, so as to assure, as nearly as
                  practicable, an even production rate at the Badak Facility
                  and an even rate of deliveries at the Delivery Point.

7.3       Buyer's Obligation to Take or Pay

          (a)     If, during any Fixed Quantity Period, any Buyer should fail
                  to take the full Fixed Quantity applicable thereto, such
                  Buyer shall pay Seller, at the Contract Sales Price in effect
                  as of the last day of such Fixed Quantity Period, for the
                  quantities of LNG required to be purchased but which were not
                  taken by such Buyer during such Fixed Quantity Period (any
                  such quantity deficiency being called a "Quantity
                  Deficiency"), subject, however, to paragraphs (b), (c) and
                  (d) below and the following:

                  (i)      If, after taking into account all adjustments
                           provided for in this Section 7.3 including any
                           Allowance that has been exercised, the Quantity
                           Deficiency of a Buyer at the end of any Fixed
                           Quantity Period amounts to less than 2.9 trillion
                           BTU's, the amount of such Quantity Deficiency shall
                           be carried forward and added to the Fixed Quantity
                           of such Buyer for the next succeeding Fixed Quantity
                           Period; provided that, notwithstanding the
                           foregoing, if the total Quantity Deficiency of those
                           Buyers whose Quantity Deficiency is less than 2.9
                           trillion BTU's shall
<PAGE>   28
                           exceed 5.8 trillion BTU's, the amount of
                           carry-forward for such Buyers shall be determined as
                           follows:

                           (A)     Any Buyer who has a Round-Up Request denied
                                   shall carry forward its Quantity Deficiency;

                           (B)     Any Buyer, other than a Buyer to whom (A)
                                   next above applies, shall carry forward the
                                   amount of such Quantity Deficiency up to
                                   1.45 trillion BTU's; and

                           (C)     Any Buyer whose Quantity Deficiency has not
                                   been fully carried forward under (A) or (B)
                                   next above shall in addition carry-forward
                                   its share of the amount equal to 5.8
                                   trillion BTU's minus the total carry-forward
                                   amount allowed under (B) above, allocated
                                   among all such Buyers in proportion to the
                                   amount by which each of their respective
                                   Quantity Deficiencies exceeds 1.45 trillion
                                   BTU's (calculated to the nearest million
                                   BTU's).

                           The amount carried forward pursuant to this clause
                           (i) shall be deducted from the Quantity Deficiency
                           of such Buyer and each Buyer to whom this clause (i)
                           applies shall be subject to take or pay pursuant to
                           this Section 7.3 only if and to the extent any
                           Quantity Deficiency remains after such deduction.

                  (ii)     If, at the time each Annual Program is developed,
                           the Quantity Deficiency of a Buyer for the
                           applicable year is estimated to amount to less than
                           a full cargo, such Buyer shall have the right to
                           request an increase in the quantities which such
                           Buyer wishes to take in such year in an amount
                           sufficient to fill out such cargo (such right being
                           herein referred to as a "Round- Up Request"). Any
                           such Round-Up Request shall not, however, increase
                           the Fixed Quantity of such Buyer. If Buyer does not
                           make a Round-Up Request, or if Seller elects not to
                           honor such Round-Up Request, the non-delivery of the
                           partial cargo of Fixed Quantity shall not constitute
                           a failure of Seller to make LNG available for sale
                           for the purpose of paragraph (b) below.

                  (iii)    At the time the Annual Program is being prepared for
                           1994 or any subsequent year, the Fixed Quantities
                           shall be adjusted at the request of Buyers to effect
                           the acceleration by one year of up to 2,910 billion
<PAGE>   29
                           BTU's if necessary to ensure that, taking into
                           account scheduled drydockings, Buyers have adequate
                           shipping capacity to transport the Fixed Quantities
                           during the year following that for which the Annual
                           Program is being prepared. Such acceleration shall
                           be effected by an appropriate increase to the Fixed
                           Quantity of a single Buyer or appropriate increases
                           to the Fixed Quantities of all or a number of
                           Buyers, as specified in such Buyers' request.
                           Corresponding decreases shall be made to the Fixed
                           Quantity or Fixed Quantities of the same Buyer(s)
                           for the Fixed Quantity Period following the Fixed
                           Quantity Period during which such acceleration
                           occurs.

                  (iv)     If, at the end of any Fixed Quantity Period, a Buyer
                           has purchased and received quantities of LNG
                           hereunder in excess of the Fixed Quantity of such
                           Buyer for such Fixed Quantity Period other than
                           Make-Up LNG, Make-Good LNG or Restoration
                           Quantities, the excess shall be applicable to reduce
                           the Fixed Quantity of such Buyer for the next
                           succeeding Fixed Quantity Period.

          (b)     The obligation (set forth in paragraph (a) above) of each
                  Buyer with regard to any Fixed Quantity Period to pay for
                  Fixed Quantities not taken shall be reduced by the quantity
                  of LNG which such Buyer was unable to purchase because of an
                  event of force majeure as defined in Article 15 affecting
                  either Seller or such Buyer or because of Seller's failure
                  for any other reason to make such quantity available for sale
                  in accordance with this Contract.

          (c)     In calculating the quantity of LNG delivered by Seller and
                  purchased by a Buyer for each Fixed Quantity Period,
                  quantities delivered and purchased within the first seven (7)
                  days of the next following Fixed Quantity Period shall be
                  included, provided such quantities were scheduled in the
                  Annual Program for the Fixed Quantity Period with respect to
                  which the calculation is being made.

          (d)     The obligation of a Buyer pursuant to paragraph (a) above to
                  pay for quantities not taken may be reduced by the exercise
                  of an Allowance as follows:

                  (i)      Each Allowance must be exercised by notice in
                           writing given to Seller by Buyers' Coordinator,
                           which will act as agent for Buyers in
<PAGE>   30
                           connection with the exercise of all Allowances. A
                           notice of the exercise of an Allowance given by
                           Buyers' Coordinator shall be deemed to have both the
                           authority of the Buyer on whose behalf it is
                           expressed to be given (the "Exercising Buyer") and
                           the consent of all other Buyers. No purported direct
                           exercise of an Allowance by a Buyer shall be valid.
                           A notice of exercise of an Allowance must be
                           received by Seller on or before January 12 of the
                           year following the Fixed Quantity Period in respect
                           of which such Allowance is exercised.

                  (ii)     Each notice of exercise of an Allowance shall
                           specify the Exercising Buyer and the quantity of LNG
                           by which such Buyer's obligation to take and/or pay
                           during the relevant Fixed Quantity Period is to be
                           reduced.

                  (iii)    No Allowance can be exercised which would result in
                           the aggregate Allowances then outstanding for all
                           Buyers during any Fixed Quantity Period after 1994
                           being in excess of 9,423 billion BTU's. Subject to
                           the provisions of subparagraph (viii) below, an
                           Allowance (or portion thereof) is outstanding until
                           either the Make-Good Obligation pursuant to
                           subparagraph (iv) below is satisfied or payment in
                           respect thereof is made pursuant to subparagraph
                           (vi) below.

                  (iv)     Each Allowance shall be made good in full (even if
                           it amounts to a fractional portion of a full cargo
                           lot) by the purchase of an equal quantity of LNG in
                           excess of Fixed Quantities ("Make-Good LNG") within
                           a period commencing January 1 of the year following
                           the Fixed Quantity Period in relation to which such
                           Allowance was exercised and ending with the earlier
                           of the expiration of five (5) calendar years or June
                           30, 2011 ("Allowance Restoration Period"). No Buyer
                           may satisfy a Make-Good Obligation or any part
                           thereof during a Fixed Quantity Period until it
                           shall first have taken its Fixed Quantity for such
                           Fixed Quantity Period. If a Buyer has more than one
                           Allowance outstanding, the Make-Good Obligations in
                           respect thereof shall be satisfied in the same
                           chronological order in which such Allowances were
                           exercised. One or more Buyers may satisfy the
                           Make-Good Obligation with respect to an Allowance
                           exercised by another Buyer.
<PAGE>   31
                  (v)      Every request for Make-Good LNG shall be made by
                           Buyers' Coordinator on behalf of a named Buyer in
                           accordance with Section 12.1 and shall specify the
                           Allowance to which it relates.  Each such request
                           shall be deemed to have the authority of the named
                           Buyer and, if the named Buyer is not the Exercising
                           Buyer, of the Exercising Buyer.

                  (vi)     If, at the expiration of the Allowance Restoration
                           Period, a Make-Good Obligation has not been
                           satisfied in full, the Exercising Buyer (whether or
                           not a Buyer other than the Exercising Buyer was
                           named in any relevant request for Make-Good LNG)
                           shall pay for any unsatisfied portion of the
                           Make-Good Obligation at the Contract Sales Price in
                           effect as of the last day of such Allowance
                           Restoration Period. The Buyer shall have the right
                           to request Make-Up LNG pursuant to Section 7.5 with
                           respect to any such payment.

                  (vii)    Seller shall not be obligated to reserve any LNG
                           production or shipping capacity for the purposes of
                           permitting Buyers to satisfy Make-Good Obligations.

                  (viii)   In the event that Buyers' Coordinator requests
                           quantities of LNG to satisfy a Make-Good Obligation
                           on behalf of a Buyer or Buyers which Seller is
                           unable to make available for any reason, including
                           force majeure, the following provisions shall apply:

                           (A)     The Exercising Buyer shall be relieved from
                                   the obligation pursuant to subparagraph (vi)
                                   above to pay for such requested quantities
                                   as of the expiration of the Allowance
                                   Restoration Period relating thereto, except
                                   in the case where subparagraph (viii)(C)
                                   below requires such payment;

                           (B)     Such requested quantities shall be deemed
                                   not outstanding for the purposes of
                                   subparagraph (iii) above until Seller shall
                                   (whether during or after the Allowance
                                   Restoration Period) have offered the same to
                                   such Buyer but shall then be outstanding if
                                   such Buyer does not accept such offer; any
                                   change in the quantity outstanding due to a
                                   failure to accept such an offer shall not
                                   result in an acceleration of any then
                                   outstanding Make-Good Obligation; and
<PAGE>   32
                           (C)     Such requested quantities shall be scheduled
                                   for delivery at any time prior to June 30,
                                   2011 as mutually agreed by Seller and the
                                   Buyer having the Make-Good Obligation.  If
                                   such requested quantities have not been
                                   scheduled as of the end of the last Fixed
                                   Quantity Period and should Seller be unable
                                   to deliver such requested quantities during
                                   the three (3) months following the last
                                   Fixed Quantity Period, Buyer shall have no
                                   further obligation in respect thereof. If
                                   Seller gives Buyer reasonable notice that
                                   such requested quantities are available
                                   during such three-month period but Buyer
                                   does not take such quantities, Buyer shall
                                   then make the payment required under
                                   subparagraph (vi) above.

                  (e)      A reduction shall be made to any Quantity Deficiency
                           equal to the amount by which such Quantity
                           Deficiency resulted from a partial loading of an LNG
                           Tanker during the relevant Fixed Quantity Period due
                           to reasons attributable to Seller.

7.4       Allocation of Deliveries between Buyers and Other Purchasers

          (a)     Whenever deliveries of LNG by Seller under this Contract must
                  be reduced by reason of an event or circumstance of force
                  majeure as defined in Article 15 affecting Seller's ability
                  to produce or load LNG from the Badak Facility, an allocation
                  of quantities then available for sale at the Badak Facility
                  will be made between Buyers and other purchasers of LNG from
                  the Badak Facility. At such times the total quantities
                  available for sale from the Badak Facility shall be allocated
                  among the purchasers therefrom (including the Buyers) pro
                  rata in the ratio of their respective quantities which are
                  eligible for allocation as provided below. The quantities
                  eligible for such allocation shall, as to Buyers, be the
                  Fixed Quantities to be purchased hereunder during the period
                  of such force majeure and, as to other purchasers, be those
                  fixed or contract quantities of LNG which are committed for
                  sale from the Badak Facility during the period of such force
                  majeure in satisfaction of Seller's contracts with other
                  purchasers which provide for sales of LNG over a term of at
                  least fifteen (15) years.

          (b)     If such an event of force majeure does not preclude full
                  production and loading of all Fixed Quantities under the
                  allocation formula described in paragraph (a) above but is of
                  such an extent as to prevent Seller from producing and
                  loading all Make-Up LNG, Make-Good LNG and Restoration
                  Quantities scheduled for
<PAGE>   33
                  delivery from the Badak Facility to Buyers and equivalent
                  quantities scheduled for delivery from the Badak Facility to
                  other purchasers under LNG sales contracts providing for
                  deliveries over a term of at least fifteen (15) years,
                  quantities of such LNG as are available shall be allocated
                  between Buyers and such other purchasers in proportion to the
                  respective quantities so scheduled.

7.5       Take-or-Pay Make-Up
          If, pursuant to Section 7.3(a) or Section 7.3(d)(vi), a Buyer shall
          have paid for any quantity of LNG which was not taken by such Buyer
          ("Take-or-Pay Quantity"), then, in any subsequent year, the said
          Buyer may purchase up to an equal quantity of LNG from Seller as
          make-up LNG ("Make-Up LNG") (to the extent not previously made up). A
          Buyer may request Make-Up LNG by giving written notice to Seller as
          provided in Section 12.1. If, during any year for which Make-Up LNG
          has been requested, (i) Seller has uncommitted quantities of LNG
          available for such purposes and (ii) such Buyer shall have first
          taken and paid for its Fixed Quantity for such year, then Seller
          shall sell to such Buyer the quantity of Make-Up LNG requested. A
          Buyer's right to purchase Make-Up LNG under this Section 7.5 shall
          expire on March 31, 2012 unless such Buyer shall have requested
          Make-Up LNG during the preceding twelve (12) months and Seller shall
          have had insufficient uncommitted LNG to meet such request. In such
          circumstances, the parties shall consult to agree upon a deferred
          schedule for Buyer to take delivery of any outstanding balance of
          Take-or-Pay Quantity not made up by March 31, 2012. Each Buyer shall
          pay for Make-Up LNG at the Contract Sales Price in effect as of the
          date of delivery, reduced by the amount previously paid on account of
          all or that part of the Take-or-Pay Quantity being made up by such
          sale. Take-or-Pay Quantities shall be made up, and prior payments
          applicable thereto applied, in the same chronological order in which
          such quantities accrued.

7.6       Force Majeure Deficiency

          (a)     If, during any Fixed Quantity Period or Fixed Quantity
                  Periods, all or any portion of the Fixed Quantity of LNG
                  required to be taken by any Buyer therein is not delivered by
                  Seller or taken by such Buyer by reason of force majeure as
                  defined in Article 15 (any such quantity not taken for such
                  reason being called a "Force Majeure Deficiency"), Seller and
                  the Buyer or Buyers concerned shall each make best efforts to
                  restore the Force Majeure Deficiency in full by Seller
                  selling and the Buyer or Buyers purchasing such quantities of
                  LNG prior to the expiration of the last Fixed Quantity
                  Period. The restoration quantities so agreed ("Restoration
                  Quantities") will be scheduled for delivery pursuant to
                  Article 12 at the mutual convenience of the parties. Such
<PAGE>   34
                  Restoration Quantities shall be subordinate to Make-Good LNG
                  requested pursuant to Section 7.3(d) and Make-Up LNG
                  requested pursuant to Section 7.5. Each Buyer shall pay for
                  Restoration Quantities at the Contract Sales Price in effect
                  as of the date of delivery.

          (b)     If an event of force majeure relieves or delays the
                  performance by any Buyer of its obligations under this
                  Contract and causes a reduction in deliveries of LNG and
                  Seller sells to third parties quantities of LNG which Buyers
                  are unable to purchase, then the Force Majeure Deficiency
                  shall be reduced by the amount, if any, that the Seller's Gas
                  Supply Obligation (including amounts so sold to third
                  parties) exceeds the estimate of Proved Remaining Recoverable
                  Reserves stated in the most recent Certificate as a result of
                  such sales.

7.7       Allocation of Make-Good LNG, Make-Up LNG and Restoration Quantities
          Whenever Make-Good LNG is requested under Section 7.3(d), Make-Up LNG
          is requested under Section 7.5 and/or Restoration Quantities are
          requested under Section 7.6(a) by a Buyer or Buyers, and quantities
          are requested for similar purposes by other purchasers from the Badak
          Facility, and uncommitted quantities of LNG are not available from
          the Badak Facility to meet all such requests, then the quantities of
          LNG which are available from the Badak Facility for such purposes
          shall be allocated, as between such Buyer or Buyers on the one hand
          and such other purchasers on the other hand, based on the proportion
          of the contract quantities of each requesting purchaser to the total
          of the contract quantities of all of the requesting purchasers.


7.8       Order of Priority of Make-Good LNG and Make-Up LNG
          Make-Good LNG requested under Section 7.3(d) and Make-Up LNG
          requested under Section 7.5 shall be delivered in the priority
          specified by Buyers' Coordinator.

                                            calendar year, the average of the
                                            monthly values of U.S.CPI for the
                                            twelve-month period commencing with
                                            the month of November, fourteen

                  of the Contract Sales Price shall be made as of each
                  effective date on which:

                  (i)      the realized export prices of more than one of the
                           field classifications of Indonesian crude oils sold
                           by PERTAMINA shall have changed from the respective
                           prices therefor included in the last preceding
                           determination of "A" made pursuant to Section 8.2
                           (a); or

                  (ii)     two or more field classifications of such crude oils
                           shall have been added to or deleted from the crude
                           oils being sold by PERTAMINA since the date of the
                           last preceding determination of "A" made pursuant to
                           Section 8.2(a).

                  Procedures for verifying changes in the realized export
                  prices of all Indonesian crude oils and for determining the
                  effective date of any adjustment of the Contract Sales Price
                  shall be separately agreed upon by Seller and Buyers.

          (c)     Seller and Buyers shall agree separate procedures for
                  handling corrections, revisions or changes in the calculation
                  of U.S.CPI. It is agreed that if at any time the U.S.
                  Department of Labor, Bureau of Labor Statistics discontinues
                  publishing a report on U.S.CPI values, then Seller and Buyers
                  shall agree upon an index method that reflects inflation in
                  the United States of America's consumer prices to replace the
                  discontinued U.S.CPI report.

                       ARTICLE 10 - INVOICES AND PAYMENT

10.1      Invoice and Cargo Documents
          Promptly after completion of loading of each LNG Tanker, Seller, or
          its representative, shall furnish to the receiving Buyer, or Buyers'
          Representative, a certificate of quantity loaded together with such
          other documents concerning the cargo as may be reasonably requested
          by Buyers for the purpose of Japanese customs clearance. Seller shall
          further, within forty-eight (48) hours of completing the loading,
          cause a laboratory analysis to be completed to determine the quality
          of the LNG and shall promptly furnish Buyer, or Buyers'
          Representative, a certificate with respect thereto together with
          details of the calculation of the number of BTU's sold. Promptly upon
          completion of such analysis and calculation, Seller, or its
          representative, shall furnish by telex or telegram to the receiving
          Buyer an invoice, stated in U.S. Dollars in the amount of the
          Contract Sales Price for the number of BTU's sold together with
          component MOL fractions, temperature, pressure and volume delivered.
          At the same time, Seller shall send Buyer a signed copy of the
          invoice and relevant documents showing the basis for the calculation
          thereof.

10.2      Other Invoices
          In the event that any monies are due from one party to the other
          hereunder, including, without limitation, amounts payable pursuant to
          Section 7.3 on account of Fixed Quantities of LNG required to be
          purchased but which were not taken by a Buyer, then the party to whom
          such monies are due shall furnish or cause to be furnished an invoice
          therefor and relevant documents showing the basis for the calculation
          thereof. The procedure set forth in Section 10.1 for sending a copy
          of such invoice by telex or telegram may be followed.

10.3      Invoice Due Dates, etc.
          Each invoice to a Buyer referred to in Section 10.1 above shall
          become due and payable by such Buyer on the eighth (8th) Business Day
          in Japan after the date on which the telex/telegraphic copy of such
          invoice has been received by such Buyer in Japan.

          Each other invoice to a Buyer hereunder shall become due and payable
          by such Buyer within twenty (20) calendar days after the date of
          Buyer's receipt of such invoice in Japan.

          Each invoice delivered to Seller shall become due and payable on the
          fourteenth (14th) calendar day after Seller's receipt thereof.
<PAGE>   39
          If any invoice due date is not a Business Day in Japan, such invoice
          shall become due and payable on the next day which is a Business Day
          in Japan.

          In the event the full amount of any invoice is not paid when due, any
          unpaid amount thereof shall bear interest from the due date until
          paid, at an interest rate, compounded annually, two percent (2%)
          greater than the Base Rate in effect from time to time during the
          period of delinquency. Such interest rate shall be adjusted up or
          down, as the case may be, to reflect any changes in the Base Rate as
          of the dates of such changes in the Base Rate.

10.4      Payment
          Each Buyer shall pay, or cause to be paid, in U.S. Dollars all
          amounts which become due and payable by such Buyer pursuant to any
          invoice issued hereunder to a bank account or accounts in the United
          States to be designated by Seller. Seller shall pay, or cause to be
          paid, in U.S. Dollars all amounts which become due and payable by
          Seller pursuant to any invoices issued hereunder to a bank account in
          Japan designated by Buyers.  The paying party shall not be
          responsible for a designated bank's disbursement of amounts remitted
          to such bank, and a deposit in immediately available funds of the
          full amount of each invoice with such bank shall constitute full
          discharge and satisfaction of the obligations under this Contract for
          which such amounts were remitted. Each payment of any amount owing
          hereunder shall be in the full amount due without reduction or offset
          for any reason, including, without limitation, taxes, exchange
          charges or bank transfer charges.

          Transfer of funds to the bank in the United States, effected from
          Japan before the close of business in Japan on or before the due date
          of any invoice, shall be deemed timely payment notwithstanding that
          such U.S. bank cannot credit such transfer as immediately available
          funds for a period of up to fourteen (14) hours by reason of the time
          difference between Japan and the United States or for one or more
          days which are not banking days in the United States.

10.5      Seller's Rights Upon Buyer's Failure to Make Payment
          If payment of any invoice for quantities of LNG sold hereunder or for
          Fixed Quantities of LNG not taken and for which a Buyer is obligated
          to pay pursuant to this Contract is not made within sixty (60) days
          after the due date thereof, Seller shall be entitled, upon giving
          thirty (30) days' written notice to such Buyer, to suspend subsequent
          sales to such Buyer until the amount of such invoice and interest
          thereon has been paid, and such Buyer shall not be entitled to any
          make-up rights in respect of such suspended sales. If any such
          invoice is not paid within one hundred twenty (120) days after the
          due date thereof, then, subject to the further provisions of this
          Section 10.5, Seller shall have the right, at Seller's election, upon
          not less than eighty
<PAGE>   40
          (80) days' notice to Buyer or Buyers, as the case may be, to exercise
          either of the following options:

          (i)     Seller may terminate this Contract in respect of the
                  defaulting Buyer only, in which event this Contract shall
                  continue in effect between Seller and the other Buyers just
                  as though the defaulting Buyer had never been a party and the
                  quantities of LNG thereafter to be purchased and received by
                  such defaulting Buyer had never been included in this
                  Contract; or

          (ii)    Seller may terminate this Contract in its entirety as to
                  Buyers unless, prior to such termination, arrangements shall
                  have been made which are satisfactory to Seller for the
                  payment of all amounts owed Seller by the defaulting Buyer
                  and for the assumption of the LNG quantity and other
                  obligations of the defaulting Buyer under this Contract by
                  one or more Buyer(s) not defaulting.

          Termination by Seller under clause (i) or (ii) above shall become
          effective upon the date specified in such notice from Seller. Any
          such termination shall be without prejudice to any other rights and
          remedies of Seller arising hereunder or by law or otherwise,
          including the right of Seller to receive payment of all obligations
          and claims which arose or accrued prior to such termination or by
          reason of such default by a Buyer or Buyers.

10.6      Disputed Invoices
          In the event of disagreement concerning any invoice, the invoiced
          party shall make provisional payment of the total amount thereof and
          shall immediately notify the other party of the reasons for such
          disagreement, except that, in the case of obvious error in
          computation, the correct amount shall be paid disregarding such
          error.  Invoices may be contested or modified only if, within a
          period of ninety (90) days after receipt thereof, Buyer or Seller
          serves notice on the other questioning their correctness. If no such
          notice is served, invoices shall be deemed correct and accepted by
          both parties. Promptly after resolution of any dispute as to an
          invoice, the amount of any overpayment or underpayment shall be paid
          by Seller or Buyer to the other, as the case may be, plus interest at
          the rate provided in Section 10.3 from the date payment was due to
          the date of payment.

11.1      Gross Heating Value
          The LNG when delivered by Seller to Buyers shall have, in a gaseous
          state, a Gross Heating Value of not less than 1065 BTU per Standard
          Cubic Foot and not more than 1165 BTU per Standard Cubic Foot. The
          expected range will be between 1105 and 1160 BTU per Standard Cubic
          Foot.

11.2      Components
          The LNG delivered by Seller to Buyers shall, in a gaseous state,
          contain not less than eighty-five molecular percentage (85 MOL%) of
          methane (CH4) and, for the components and substances listed below,
          such LNG shall not contain more than the following:

          A.      Nitrogen (N2), 1.0 MOL%.
          B.      Butanes (C4) and heavier, 2.00 MOL%.
          C.      Pentanes (C5) and heavier, 0.10 MOL%.
          D.      Hydrogen sulfide (H2S), 0.25 grains per 100 Standard Cubic
                  Feet (0.25 grains/100 scf).
          E.      Total sulfur content, 1.3 grains per 100 Standard Cubic Feet
                  (1.3 grains/100 scf).

          Although the LNG which Seller delivers to Buyers is permitted to
          contain the sulfur concentrations shown in clauses D and E above,
          under normal operating conditions at the Badak Facility, Seller would
          expect such concentrations to be materially less.

          Should any question regarding quality of the LNG arise, Buyers and
          Seller shall consult and cooperate concerning such questions.

12.1      Annual Program

          (a)     Not later than ninety (90) days prior to the beginning of
                  each calendar year commencing with the year in which the
                  first Fixed Quantity Period occurs, Seller shall give written
                  notice to Buyers of the anticipated quantities of LNG to be
                  available for sale hereunder from the Badak Facility for each
                  calendar quarter of the next calendar year, specifying any
                  scheduled downtime of the Badak Facility.  On or before
                  October 15 of each year in which such notice is given, each
                  Buyer shall advise Seller in writing of: (i) the quantities
                  such Buyer wishes to take during each calendar quarter of the
                  following year, specifying the amount of any Make-Up LNG
                  requested pursuant to Section 7.5 and any Restoration
                  Quantities in excess of Fixed Quantities requested pursuant
                  to Section 7.6(a), and (ii) any planned downtime for
                  Receiving Facilities, Buyers' shipping capacity and scheduled
                  drydocking for LNG Tankers.  In addition, by October 15 of
                  each year, Buyers' Coordinator shall request any Make-Good
                  LNG pursuant to Section 7.3 (d).

                  Seller and Buyers shall thereupon consult together with a
                  view to reaching agreement by December 1 of the same year and
                  Seller shall issue a programming schedule, including
                  provisional loading dates, for quantities sold hereunder to
                  be loaded in full cargo lots at the Badak Facility during
                  each calendar month during the following year (the "Annual
                  Program"), and in so doing Seller and Buyers shall take into
                  consideration the contents of the above notices. The Annual
                  Program shall take into account Seller's commitments to other
                  purchasers of LNG from the Badak Facility. Such Annual
                  Program and the Ninety-Day Schedules referred to below (and
                  any revisions thereof) are intended to assist the parties in
                  planning their respective operations during the periods
                  involved. The content of the Annual Program and Ninety-Day
                  Schedules shall not reduce the entitlement of any party
                  during any Fixed Quantity Period to sell and be paid for, or
                  to purchase and receive, as the case may be, the quantities
                  of LNG required under Article 7 to be sold and paid for
                  during such Fixed Quantity Period. Seller and Buyers will
                  each take all appropriate steps to carry out each Annual
                  Program and Ninety-Day Schedule.
<PAGE>   43
          (b)     An Annual Program shall be amended to reflect a request for:

                  (i)      Make-Good LNG relating to an Allowance exercised in
                           respect of the immediately preceding year;
                  (ii)     Make-Up LNG relating to a Take-or-Pay Quantity paid
                           for in respect of the immediately preceding year; or
                  (iii)    Restoration Quantities relating to a Force Majeure
                           Deficiency arising in respect of the immediately
                           preceding year;

                  provided that the requested LNG is available and such request
                  is received by Seller not later than January 15 of the year
                  to which such Annual Program relates.

12.2      Ninety-Day Schedules
          Not later than the fifteenth (15th) day of each calendar month,
          Seller shall, after discussion with each Buyer, deliver to each Buyer
          a three-month forward plan of loadings (the "Ninety-Day Schedule"),
          which follows the applicable Annual Program (or most current draft
          thereof) as nearly as practicable and sets forth the projected dates
          of loadings for each of the next three (3) calendar months. Each
          Ninety-Day Schedule shall reflect all adjustments, if any,
          necessitated by deviation from prior Ninety-Day Schedules so as to
          maintain as far as practicable the loadings forecast in the Annual
          Program. Both parties shall cooperate to facilitate smooth
          performance of the Ninety-Day Schedule. After consultation with
          Buyers, Seller shall revise the Ninety- Day Schedule when appropriate
          to meet operational requirements with the overall objective of
          fulfilling the Annual Program as far as practicable, taking into
          account any requests of Buyers for adjustments.

13.4      Tank Gauge Tables of LNG Tankers
          Buyers shall provide Seller, or cause Seller to be provided, with a
          certified copy of tank gauge tables for each tank of each LNG Tanker
          verified by a competent impartial authority or authorities mutually
          agreed upon by the parties. Such tables shall include correction
          tables for list, trim, tank construction and any other items
          requiring such tables for accuracy of gauging. Seller and Buyers
          shall each have the right to have representatives present at the time
          each LNG tank on each LNG Tanker is volumetrically calibrated. If the
          LNG tanks of any LNG Tanker suffer distortion of such nature as to
          cause a prudent expert reasonably to question the validity of the
          tank gauge tables described herein (or any subsequent calibration
          provided for herein), any Buyer or Seller may require recalibration
          of such LNG tanks during any period when the LNG Tanker is out of
          service for inspection and/or repairs. Upon recalibration of the LNG
          tanks of the LNG Tankers, the same procedures used to provide the
          original tank gauge tables will be used to provide revised tank gauge
          tables based upon the recalibration data. The calibration of tanks
          provided for in this Section 13.4 shall constitute the only
          calibration required for purposes of this Contract.

13.5      Gauging and Measuring LNG Volumes Delivered
          Volumes of LNG delivered pursuant to this Contract shall be
          determined by gauging the LNG in the tanks of the LNG Tankers before
          and after loading.

          Gauging the liquid in the tanks of the LNG Tankers and measuring of
          liquid temperature, vapor temperature, vapor pressure and liquid
          density in each LNG tank, trim and list of the LNG Tankers, and
          atmospheric pressure shall be performed, or be caused to be
          performed, by the Buyer purchasing the LNG, before and after loading.
<PAGE>   46
          The first gauging and measurements shall be made immediately before
          the commencement of loading. The second gauging and measurements
          shall take place immediately after the completion of loading.

          Copies of gauging and measurement records shall be furnished to 
          Seller.

          A.      Gauging the Liquid Level of LNG
                  The level of the LNG in each LNG tank of the LNG Tanker shall
                  be gauged by means of the gauging device installed in the LNG
                  Tanker for that purpose. The level of the LNG in each tank
                  shall be logged or printed.

          B.      Determination of Temperature
                  The temperature of the LNG and of the vapor space in each
                  cargo tank shall be measured by means of a sufficient number
                  of properly located temperature measuring devices to permit
                  the determination of average temperature. Temperatures shall
                  be logged or printed.

          C.      Determination of Pressure
                  The pressure of the vapor in each LNG tank shall be
                  determined by means of pressure measuring devices installed
                  in each LNG tank of the LNG Tankers. The atmospheric pressure
                  shall be determined by readings from the standard barometer
                  installed in the LNG Tankers.

          D.      Determination of Density
                  Density of the LNG shall be computed by Seller or, if
                  mutually agreed, measured. Initially, the density of the LNG
                  will be computed by the method described in Schedule A.
                  Should any improved data, method of calculation or direct
                  measurement device become available which is acceptable to
                  both Buyers and Seller, such improved data, method or device
                  shall then be used. If density is determined by measurements,
                  the results shall be logged or printed.

13.6      Samples for Quality Analysis
          Representative samples of the LNG delivered shall be obtained, or be
          caused to be obtained, in triplicate by Seller during the time of
          loading. The three (3) samples shall be taken from an appropriate
          point on Seller's loading line as close as possible to the loading
          flanges and collected in the gaseous state using the continuous
          gasification/collection method agreed by Buyers and Seller.
<PAGE>   47
          In addition periodic samples shall be obtained during loading. Should
          Seller determine that it is necessary to utilize periodic samples,
          the composition of the LNG delivered to each LNG Tanker shall be the
          arithmetic average of the results obtained by analysis of such
          samples. The method and devices for sampling and the quantity of the
          samples to be withdrawn shall be determined by agreement between
          Buyers and Seller to provide for taking representative and adequate
          samples of the LNG delivered.

          The samples obtained shall be distributed as follows:

                  First sample     -        for use of Seller.

                  Second sample    -        for use of Buyer receiving the LNG 
                                            shipment.

                  Third sample     -        for retention by Seller for the
                                            agreed period, not to exceed
                                            twenty-five (25) days, during which
                                            period any dispute as to the
                                            accuracy of any analysis shall be
                                            raised, in which case the sample
                                            shall be further retained until
                                            such Buyer and Seller agree to
                                            retain it no longer.


13.7      Quality Analysis
          The samples provided for in Section 13.6 shall be analyzed, or be
          caused to be analyzed, by Seller to determine the molar fraction of
          the hydrocarbon and other components in the sample by gas
          chromatography using a mutually agreed method in accordance with
          "G.P.A. Standard 2261, Analysis for Natural Gas and Similar Gaseous
          Mixtures by Gas Chromatography", published by G.P.A., current as of
          1990 or as otherwise mutually agreed upon. If better standards for
          analysis are subsequently adopted by G.P.A. or other recognized
          competent impartial authority, upon mutual agreement of Buyers and
          Seller, they shall be substituted for the standard then in use, but
          such substitution shall not take place retroactively. A calibration
          of the chromatograph or other analytical instrument used shall be
          performed by Seller immediately prior to the analysis of the sample
          of LNG delivered. Seller shall give advance notice to Buyers of the
          time Seller intends to conduct a calibration thereof, and Buyers
          shall have the right to have a representative present at each such
          calibration; provided, however, Seller will not be obligated to defer
          or reschedule any calibration in order to permit the representative
          of Buyers to be present.
<PAGE>   48
          The sample shall be analyzed, or be caused to be analyzed, by Seller
          to determine the concentrations of hydrogen sulfide (H2S) and total
          sulfur content referred to in Section 11.2 using the methods
          described in Schedule A.

13.8      Operating Procedures
          Prior to conducting operations for measurement, gauging and analysis
          provided in Sections 13.5, 13.6 and 13.7, the party responsible for
          such operations shall notify the appropriate representatives of the
          other party, allowing such representatives reasonable opportunity to
          be present for all operations and computations; however, the absence
          of the other party's representative after notification and
          opportunity to attend shall not prevent any operations and
          computations from being performed. At the request of either party,
          any measurement, gauging and analysis provided for in Sections 13.5,
          13.6 and 13.7 shall be witnessed and verified by an independent
          surveyor mutually agreed upon by the Buyer and Seller. The results of
          such surveyor's verifications shall be made available promptly to
          each party. All records of measurement and the computation results
          shall be preserved and available to both parties for a period of not
          less than three (3) years after such measurement and computation.

13.9      BTU Quantities Sold
          The quantity of BTU's sold shall be calculated by Seller following
          the procedures described in this Section 13.9 and shall be verified
          by an independent surveyor mutually agreed upon by Seller and Buyers.

          A.      Determination of Gross Heating Value
                  The Gross Heating Value of the samples of the LNG shall be
                  determined by computation, in accordance with the method
                  described in Schedule A, on the basis of the molecular
                  composition determined pursuant to Section 13.7 and of the
                  molecular weights and heating values described in "G.P.A.
                  Publication 2145" published by G.P.A., current at the time of
                  computation.

                  If better constants or improved methods for determination of
                  heating value are subsequently adopted by G.P.A. or other
                  recognized competent impartial authority, they shall, upon
                  mutual agreement of Seller and Buyers, be substituted
                  therefor, but not retroactively. The Gross Heating Value of
                  the representative sample shall be the conclusive Gross
                  Heating Value for the purpose of determining quantities of
                  BTU's sold.

B.        Determination of Volume of LNG Loaded
          The LNG volume in the tanks of the LNG Tanker before and after
          loading shall be determined by gauging as provided in Section 13.5 on
          the basis of the tank gauge tables provided for in Section 13.4. The
          volume of LNG remaining in the tanks of the LNG Tanker before loading
          shall then be subtracted from the volume after loading and the
          resulting volume shall be taken as the volume of the LNG delivered to
          the LNG Tanker.

          If failure of gauging and measuring devices of an LNG Tanker should
          make it impossible to determine the LNG volume, the volume of LNG
          delivered shall be determined by gauging the liquid level in Seller's
          onshore LNG storage tanks immediately before and after loading the
          LNG Tanker, and such volume shall be reduced by subtracting an
          estimated LNG volume, agreed upon by the parties, for boil-off from
          such tanks during the loading of such LNG Tanker. Seller shall
          provide Buyers, or cause the Buyers to be provided with, a certified
          copy of tank gauge tables for each onshore LNG tank which is to be
          used for this purpose, such tables to be verified by a competent
          impartial authority.

C.        Determination of BTU Quantities Sold
          The quantities of BTU's sold shall be computed by Seller by means of
          the following formula:

                  Q = V x D x P

          where:  Q        represents the quantity of the LNG sold in BTU's.
                  V        represents the volume of the LNG loaded, stated in
                           Cubic Meters, determined as provided in Section 13.9
                           B.
                  D        represents the density of the LNG loaded, stated in
                           kilograms per Cubic Meter, determined as provided in
                           Section 13.5 D.
                  P        represents the Gross Heating Value of the LNG
                           loaded, stated in BTU's per kilogram.

          Physical constants, calculation procedures and examples of BTU
          determination are provided in Schedule A.

13.10     Verification of Accuracy and Correction for Error Accuracy of devices
          used shall be tested and verified at the request of either party,
          including the request by a party to verify accuracy of its own
          devices. Each party shall have the right to inspect at any time the
          measurement devices installed by the other party, provided that the
          other party be notified in advance. Testing shall be performed only
          when both parties are represented, or have received adequate advance
          notice thereof, using methods recommended by the manufacturer or any
          other method agreed to by Seller and Buyers. At the request of any
          party hereto, any test shall be witnessed and verified by an
          independent surveyor mutually agreed upon by Buyers and Seller.
          Permissible tolerances shall be defined in Schedule A. Inaccuracy of
          a device exceeding the permissible tolerances shall require
          correction of previous recordings, and computations made on the basis
          of those recordings, to zero error with respect to any period which
          is definitely known or agreed upon by the parties, as well as
          adjustment of the device. In the event that the period of error is
          neither known nor agreed upon, corrections shall be made for each
          delivery made during the last half of the period since the date of
          the most recent calibration of the inaccurate device. However, the
          provisions of this Section 13.10 shall not be applied to require the
          modification of any invoice that has become final pursuant to Section
          10.6.

13.11     Disputes
          In the event of any dispute concerning the subject matter of this

          result of measurement, sampling, analysis, computation or method of
          calculation, such dispute shall be submitted to a competent impartial
          authority mutually agreed upon by the parties or, if such authority
          cannot be agreed upon within thirty (30) days of request by either
          party, such dispute shall be decided by arbitration pursuant to
          Article 16. All decisions of an authority acting under this Section
          13.11 shall be binding on the parties.  Expenses incurred in
          connection with the services of such authority shall be shared
          equally by the parties.

            SIDE LETTER TO SECOND AMENDED AND RESTATED 1981 BADAK
                      LNG SALES CONTRACT August 3, 1995

CHUBU ELECTRIC POWER CO., INC.
THE KANSAI ELECTRIC POWER CO., INC.
OSAKA GAS CO., LTD.
TOHO GAS CO., LTD.

Gentlemen,

This Side Letter relates to the Second Amended and Restated 1981 Badak LNG
Sales Contract ("Second A/R") of even date herewith (terms defined therein
having the same meanings when used in this Side Letter).

A.       HNS CONVENTION

         The International Maritime Organization is developing an International
Convention on Liability and Compensation for Damage in Connection with the
Carriage of Hazardous and Noxious Substances by Sea ("HNS Convention"). If it
becomes likely that the HNS Convention will apply to shipments of LNG under the
Second A/R, then Seller and Buyers shall engage in a process of mutual review
and consultation in order to determine how to allocate any payments Seller is
required to make under the HNS Convention relating to the Fixed Quantities.

B.       OMNIBUS AGREEMENT AND WAIVER AGREEMENT

         Conditions of Use for Bontang, Selatan LNG Marine Terminal
("Conditions of Use") will be signed by the master of each LNG Tanker before
using the Loading Port facilities. The Conditions of Use shall be modified by
an Omnibus Agreement between Seller, Seller's Suppliers and Buyers' Transporter
(the "Omnibus Agreement") and a Waiver Agreement between Seller, Seller's
Suppliers, Buyers' Transporter and Buyers (the "Waiver Agreement") which
(subject to the paragraph below) are in the same form and substance as hitherto
executed in connection with the use of the Loading Port by other LNG vessels.
If Seller and Buyers agree to modify the existing Omnibus Agreement, Seller
shall sign and cause Seller's Suppliers to sign such modified Omnibus Agreement
and Buyers shall cause Buyers' Transporter to sign such modified Omnibus
Agreement. In addition, if Seller and Buyers agree to modify the existing
Waiver Agreement, Seller shall sign and cause Seller's Suppliers to sign such
modified Waiver Agreement and Buyers shall sign and cause Buyers' Transporter
to sign such modified Waiver Agreement.

         Seller believes that changing circumstances and increasing values at
the Badak Facility necessitate making changes to the Omnibus Agreement
regarding the required protection and indemnity insurance coverage in respect
of the LNG Tankers ("P&I Cover"). Seller and Buyers shall therefore engage as
soon as possible in a process of mutual review and consultation in order to
determine whether the P&I Cover should be increased to U.S.$300,000,000, as
proposed by Seller.
<PAGE>   69
C.       DEFINITION OF BUSINESS DAY IN JAPAN

         Seller and Buyers have not reached a conclusion regarding whether
December 31 should be considered a Business Day in Japan. Buyers are not able
to make payment to Seller on December 31 through a bank in Japan since December
31 is, by Japanese Government order, a non-banking day in Japan. However,
Seller believes the treatment of December 31 as a non-business day would cause
Seller to incur substantial financial losses and is not justified by the
difficulties faced by Buyers.

         Seller and Buyers are willing to engage in a process of mutual review
and consultation on the exclusion of December 31 as a Business Day in Japan in
the context of considering such a change for all of Seller's sales contracts
with Japanese buyers.

D.       PRICE TRANSITION

         With regard to the transition from the price under the First A/R and
the Second A/R, Seller and Buyers have agreed to the following:

         (i)     The provisions regarding Contract Sales Price set forth in
                 Article 8 of the First A/R shall apply to each Buyer
                 individually until such Buyer's Fixed Quantities under the
                 First A/R are sold and delivered ("FQ Cut-Off Point"). For the
                 purpose of determining the FQ Cut-Off Point for each Buyer,
                 any outstanding Quantity Deficiency, Force Majeure Deficiency
                 and Allowance shall be added to the Fixed Quantities delivered
                 under the First A/R.

         (ii)    During the period from January 1, 2000 until the FQ Cut-Off
                 Point, the Floor Price (as defined in the First A/R) shall
                 apply and shall be calculated as if the Amended and Restated
                 1973 LNG Sales Contract dated January 1, 1990 were still in
                 effect.

         (iii)   The provisions regarding Contract Sales Price set forth in
                 Article 8 of the Second A/R shall apply individually to the
                 Fixed Quantities of each Buyer sold and delivered after such
                 Buyer's FQ Cut-Off Point and to all Make-Up LNG, Make-Good LNG
                 and Restoration Quantities delivered after such FQ Cut-Off
                 Point.

         (iv)    Seller and Buyers recognize the possibility that the
                 application of the above may result in cargo deliveries which
                 contain quantities at the First A/R Contract Sales Price and
                 quantities at the Second A/R Contract Sales Price.

         (v)     Seller and Buyers shall agree such implementation procedures
                 as may be required to give effect to the above.
<PAGE>   70
E.       PRICING

         Article 8 of the Second A/R refers to realized export prices (except
premiums and except prices for spot sales) of field classifications of
Indonesian crude oils being sold and exported. The parties acknowledge that as
of the effective date of the Second A/R, the Indonesian Crude Price (ICP)
system establishes such realized export prices.

         If at any time in the opinion of Seller or Buyers, based on their
independent studies, the prices of the field classifications used by Seller to
determine "A" in the formula in Section 8.2(a) are materially different from
the realized export prices, such party shall so notify the other stating the
basis for such opinion, and the parties shall consult promptly and jointly
review the matter with a view to determining whether such difference exists
and, if so, to establishing an alternative basis, to be adopted by Seller, for
determining (for the purposes of the Second A/R) such realized export prices
(except premiums and except prices for spot sales).

         In such event the parties shall continue to administer and perform the
provisions of the Second A/R, and to determine the Contract Sales Price and
submit and pay invoices, on the basis provided for in the Second A/R, until the
parties shall have completed such joint review.

         If, upon completion of such joint review, it is determined that such
difference exists, then Seller shall promptly take all measures to ensure
proper administration of the Second A/R at all times, including any necessary
recalculation of the Contract Sales Price.

F.       EXCESS CAPACITY

         Seller confirms that it places great importance on the mutual trust
and cooperation that exists with Buyers, and that no changes effected by the
said amendment and restatement are intended to adversely effect the
relationship between the parties. Seller also fully appreciates the marketing
opportunities for the excess capacity of its LNG facilities provided by Buyers
and will continue to pursue such opportunities in the future.

         It is Seller's policy to retain the right to dispose of the excess
capacity of its LNG facilities to such purchasers and upon such terms as it may
elect. Seller is therefore unable to grant any general reservations of its
excess capacity.

         However, in view of the long term business relationship between Seller
and Buyers, Seller agrees that once a Buyer offers in writing to purchase a
specified quantity of LNG on terms to be agreed, then and to the extent Seller
determines that it has excess LNG production capacity and (if applicable)
shipping capacity available, then Seller will give preferential consideration
to such offer over future offers from other potential purchasers for a
reasonable period while good faith negotiations are being conducted with such
Buyer.

G.       SIDE LETTER TO BADAK LNG SALES CONTRACT

         With regard to the Amended and Restated Side Letter to Badak LNG Sales
Contract, dated January 1, 1990, between Seller and Buyers (a copy of which is
attached hereto), it is hereby agreed that such Side Letter shall continue in
full and force effect and shall apply mutatis mutandis to the Second A/R.

This Side Letter shall be effective as of the date of execution, except the
provisions of paragraphs E, F and G above shall be effective as of and from
April 1, 2003. This Side Letter supersedes as of April 1, 2003 any prior
written instrument between the parties with respect to the subjects herein
mentioned .

                 risk and expense of the LNG Tanker. Prior to each loading,
                 Buyer shall be responsible for determining the availability of
                 utilities required by the LNG Tanker at the Loading Port,
                 which will be provided by Seller, if available, and be for
                 Buyer's account.

         (b)     Buyer shall be responsible for payment of amounts due for
                 supplies and services requested by the master of the LNG
                 Tanker.

         (c)     Prior to the first sale and delivery of LNG hereunder from the
                 Loading Port, Seller shall sign, and cause Seller's Suppliers
                 to sign, the Omnibus Agreement and Waiver Agreement; Buyer
                 shall sign, and cause Buyer's Transporter to sign, the Waiver
                 Agreement; and Buyer shall cause Buyer's Transporter to sign
                 the Omnibus Agreement.

         (d)     In the interests of the smooth and timely performance of
                 Buyer's obligation to provide transportation of LNG purchased
                 under this

                 Contract, Seller shall provide assistance to Buyer and Buyer's
                 Transporter in obtaining equipment, supplies, services upon
                 the same terms as the assistance provided by Seller to other
                 vessels using the Loading Port.

4.5      Cargo Loading
         (a)     The LNG to be sold and purchased hereunder shall be pumped
                 into an LNG Tanker at Seller's expense through manifold
                 strainers of sixty (60) mesh (or such other mesh as shall be
                 agreed from time to time by the Parties) provided by the LNG
                 Tanker. Unless otherwise provided in this Contract or absent
                 agreement of the Parties or an unavoidable circumstance, the
                 LNG shall be delivered and received in full LNG Tanker Cargo
                 Lots.

         (b)     There shall be no charge for any Natural Gas boiled-off from
                 the LNG Tanker while berthed at the Loading Port that is
                 returned to the Loading Port Facilities. The LNG Tanker shall
                 compress such boil- off gas to the extent required to maintain
                 the gas pressure in the LNG Tanker's cargo tanks as well as in
                 the boil-off gas return line within allowable operating limits
                 during loading. Seller shall operate the boil-off gas return
                 system in a manner that will permit the gas pressure in the
                 LNG Tanker's cargo tanks to be maintained within the allowable
                 operating limits of such tanks.

4.6      Notifications of Estimated Time of Arrival at Loading Port; Cooling
         Requirements 
         (a)     Buyer shall give prompt notice to Seller by telex or 
                 facsimile of the date and hour on which each LNG Tanker 
                 departs from the Unloading Port or drydock/repair port
                 and the estimated time of arrival ("ETA") at the Loading Port.
                 Buyer shall include in such notice to Seller a statement of:

                 (i)      the estimated quantity of LNG that will be required
                          to cool the LNG Tanker's cargo tanks to permit
                          continuous loading of LNG and the estimated time that
                          will be required for such cooling, both of which will
                          be based upon the date the LNG Tanker is expected to
                          commence loading;

                 (ii)     any operational deficiencies in the LNG Tanker that
                          may affect its port performance; and

                 (iii)    requirements for available utilities.





                                       13
<PAGE>   21
                 Buyer shall arrange for the LNG Tanker's master to notify
                 Seller regarding any change in the ETA equal to or greater
                 than twelve (12) hours. If the LNG Tanker's cargo tanks
                 require cooling or if the cooling or utilities requirements or
                 the condition of the LNG Tanker should change due to
                 circumstances discovered after transmittal of the notice
                 required by this paragraph (a), the master of the LNG Tanker
                 shall give prompt notice thereof to Seller, setting forth the
                 information required by this paragraph (a) and amending the
                 information previously given to Seller.

         (b)     Ninety-six (96) hours prior to the LNG Tanker's arrival at the
                 Loading Port, the LNG Tanker's master shall give notice by
                 telex or facsimile to Seller, stating its ETA. If this ETA
                 changes by more than six (6) hours, the LNG Tanker's master
                 shall promptly give notice of the corrected ETA to Seller.

         (c)     Forty-eight (48) hours prior to the LNG Tanker's arrival at
                 the Loading Port, its master shall give notice by telex or
                 facsimile to Seller confirming or amending its latest ETA
                 notice. If this ETA changes by more than six (6) hours the
                 master shall promptly give notice of the corrected ETA to
                 Seller.

         (d)     Twenty-four (24) hours prior to the LNG Tanker's arrival at
                 the Loading Port, an ETA notice shall be sent by telex or
                 facsimile and by radio to Seller confirming or amending the
                 latest ETA notice. If this ETA changes by more than two (2)
                 hours the master shall give prompt notice of the corrected ETA
                 to Seller.

         (e)     The master shall send a final ETA notice by telex or facsimile
                 and radio five (5) hours prior to the LNG Tanker's arrival at
                 the Loading Port.

4.7      Berthing Assignments
         Seller shall determine the berthing sequence of LNG vessels at the
         Loading Port in order to best ensure compliance with the overall
         loading schedule of the Loading Port Facilities, as applicable
         (including the Annual Program and Ninety-Day Schedule hereunder) and
         shall notify the master of the LNG Tanker of its berthing priority,
         upon receipt of the Notice of Readiness.





                                       14

4.8      Vessels Not Ready for Loading
         (a)     If an LNG Tanker arrives not ready to load for any reason,
                 Seller may or may not allow it to berth. In the case of an LNG
                 Tanker only requiring cooldown to be ready to load Seller
                 shall not defer berthing if such cooldown was provided for in
                 the most recent Ninety-Day Schedule, or if the cooldown time
                 is not expected to exceed six (6) hours. Whenever Buyer
                 notifies Seller that an LNG Tanker will require cooldown,
                 Seller shall make provision therefor in the Ninety-Day
                 Schedule as soon as Seller can do so without disrupting the
                 overall loading schedule or operations of the Loading Port
                 Facilities.

         (b)     If any LNG Tanker, previously believed to be ready for loading
                 or cooling, is determined to be not ready after being berthed,
                 Seller may direct the master to vacate the berth and proceed
                 to anchorage, whether or not other vessels are awaiting a
                 berth, unless it appears reasonably certain that such LNG
                 Tanker can be readied within four (4) hours and Seller has not
                 concluded that such LNG Tanker is unsafe.

         (c)     When an LNG Tanker at anchorage is ready for loading or
                 cooling its master will notify Seller. Seller shall assign a
                 berth to such LNG Tanker as soon as Seller is able to do so
                 without disrupting Seller's loading requirements or
                 operations.

4.9      Notice of Readiness
         As soon as an LNG Tanker is securely moored at the berth or securely
         anchored awaiting a berth, has received all necessary port clearances
         and is able to receive LNG for loading or cooling, its master shall
         give notice of readiness to Seller ("Notice of Readiness"); provided,
         however, that in the event an LNG Tanker arrives at the Loading Port
         prior to the date established in the Ninety-Day Schedule (and any
         revisions thereof except those made after the LNG Tanker has commenced
         its voyage to the Loading Port unless made as a result of delays
         caused by the operations of the LNG Tanker) the Notice of Readiness
         shall be deemed effective at the earlier of: (a) 0:00 a.m. local time
         on the scheduled loading date; or (b) the time loading commences.

4.10     Tank Temperature for Loading and Statement of Cooling Time
         Buyer shall cause Buyer's Transporter after each discharge of a cargo
         at the Unloading Port to retain on board each LNG Tanker sufficient
         LNG, based on normal operations of the vessel (subject to making
         adequate provision for any mechanical problems of which Buyer's
         Transporter is aware), to maintain, for a period of not less than
         twenty-four (24) hours after the later of: (a) the actual





                                       15
<PAGE>   23
         arrival; or (b) 0:00 a.m. local time on the scheduled loading date of
         such vessel at the Loading Port, a temperature in its cargo tanks
         sufficiently cold to permit continuous loading of LNG ("Arrival
         Temperature Requirement"); provided, however, that the Arrival
         Temperature Requirement shall not apply upon the vessel's initial
         entry into service, or in cases where the LNG Tanker proceeds directly
         from a drydock/repair port to the Loading Port. When an LNG Tanker
         requires cooling, the master or Buyer shall inform Seller at the time
         of the first notice under Subarticle 4.6(a) and also at the time of
         the Notice of Readiness pursuant to Subarticle 4.9. After the vessel
         has been cooled to a temperature required to enable continuous loading
         to take place, Buyer and Seller shall sign a statement of cooling time
         ("Statement of Cooling Time").

4.11     Quantities for Purging and Cooling of Tanks
         Quantities of LNG required to purge and cool each LNG Tanker to the
         temperature that will permit continuous loading of LNG shall be
         delivered by Seller without charge to Buyer upon the initial entry of
         such vessel into service as an LNG Tanker subsequent to gas trials and
         upon its return to service after each scheduled maintenance period.
         For a vessel temporarily in service as an LNG Tanker to receive such
         quantities of LNG without charge to Buyer, such vessel must remain in
         service for a period of not less than four (4) continuous months. All
         other LNG required by the vessel for purging and cooling shall be
         sold, delivered and invoiced by Seller and paid for by Buyer at the
         Contract Sales Price applicable to such cargo; provided that where any
         LNG Tanker, having met the Arrival Temperature Requirement, needs
         purging or cooldown due to an event which does not extend the Allowed
         Laytime under Subarticle 4.12, then such LNG shall be provided by
         Seller without charge.  The Contract Sales Price shall be applied to
         the total liquid quantities delivered for purging and cooling,
         measured before evaporation. The Parties will determine by mutual
         agreement the rates and pressures for delivery of LNG for purging and
         cooling and the method for determining quantities used for such
         operations.  Quantities of LNG used to bring the LNG Tanker to a
         temperature permitting continuous loading of LNG shall not be applied
         against the quantities required to be sold by Seller and taken, or
         paid for if not taken, by Buyer under Subarticle 7.3 of this Contract.

4.12     Demurrage at Loading Port
         (a)     In the event used laytime in loading an LNG Tanker, as
                 calculated under paragraph (c) below ("Used Laytime"), exceeds
                 allowed laytime, as set forth in paragraph (b) below ("Allowed
                 Laytime"), Seller shall pay to Buyer, or for Buyer's account
                 if so directed by Buyer, demurrage





                                       16

                 ("Demurrage") at a rate per day in US Dollars (reduced
                 pro-rata for each partial day) determined in accordance with
                 the following:

                     Demurrage rate   =       126,912 x P
                                                         B

                 Where

                                                    n
                          P       =          P (1+i)  - R
                           B                  T          T

                 in which

                          P       =        0.599
                           T

                          i       =        a fixed escalation rate of 0.025

                          n       =        11 on January 1, 1994 and one higher
                                           whole number on each subsequent 
                                           January 1

                          R       =        0.029
                           T

                 Provided, however, that no Demurrage shall be payable under
                 this paragraph (a) for any quarter in which the aggregate
                 number of hours by which Used Laytime exceeds Allowed Laytime
                 for all voyages during such quarter is less than twenty-four
                 (24) hours. Buyer shall invoice Seller for Demurrage amounts
                 due under this paragraph (a) at the end of each calendar
                 quarter and Seller shall pay the invoice in accordance with
                 Article 10.

         (b)     Allowed Laytime at the Loading Port shall be twenty-four (24)
                 consecutive hours extended by any period of delay which is
                 caused by:

                 (i)      reasons attributable to the LNG Tanker, or its
                          master, crew, owner or operator, including the period
                          of time when the LNG Tanker: (A) awaits berth by
                          reason of the exercise by Seller of its rights under
                          Subarticle 4.8; or (B) receives LNG for purging and
                          cooldown;

                 (ii)     Force Majeure, as defined in Article 15;

                 (iii)    "adverse weather conditions", which for purposes
                          hereof means weather and/or sea conditions actually
                          experienced at the Loading





                                       17
<PAGE>   25
                          Port that are sufficiently severe either: (A) to
                          prevent all LNG Tankers from proceeding to berth,
                          loading, or departing from berth in accordance with
                          the weather standards prescribed in published
                          regulations in effect at the Loading Port; or (B) to
                          cause an actual determination by the master that it
                          is unsafe for the LNG Tanker to berth, load or depart
                          from berth. The period of delay to an LNG Tanker
                          caused by adverse weather conditions shall not be
                          considered to extend past the time during which such
                          adverse weather conditions actually prevailed, except
                          where additional delay is caused by the intervening
                          occupation of the berth by another LNG Tanker at the
                          Loading Port; and

                 (iv)     any period of delay caused by occupancy of the berth:
                          (A) by a previous LNG Tanker, provided such occupancy
                          is for reasons attributable to such LNG Tanker; (B)
                          by either a previous LNG Tanker or another vessel on
                          its scheduled loading date; or (C) by either a
                          previous LNG Tanker, or another vessel that arrived
                          prior to the LNG Tanker, when the LNG Tanker arrived
                          after its scheduled loading date.

         (c)     Used Laytime shall begin to count upon the LNG Tanker being
                 "all fast" in berth and shall continue to run until stand-by
                 engine prior to departure. To Used Laytime calculated as above
                 shall be added:

                 (i)      the number of hours by which the total of periods of
                          delay, as defined below, occurring between Notice of
                          Readiness and "all fast" in berth exceeds six (6);
                          and

                 (ii)     the total of periods of delay occurring between
                          stand-by engine and the LNG Tanker clearing the
                          Loading Port (i.e., passing the agreed position for
                          tendering Notice of Readiness).

         For the purposes of this paragraph (c), "delay" means all berth delays
         and stoppages that prevent the forward or outward movement of the LNG
         Tanker to or from the berth, the port and the approaches thereto,
         including any delay caused to an LNG Tanker by quarantine at the
         Loading Port.

4.13     Effect of Loading Port Delays; Transportation Costs
         (a)     If an LNG Tanker is delayed in berthing and/or commencement of
                 loading for reasons other than Force Majeure affecting the
                 Loading Port Facilities or such LNG Tanker and other than the
                 fault of the LNG Tanker, or its master, crew, owner or
                 operator and if as a result thereof the commencement of
                 loading is delayed beyond thirty (30) hours after Notice of
                 Readiness has been given, then Seller shall pay Buyer an
                 amount, on account of excess boil-off, equal to the Contract
                 Sales Price multiplied by the BTU equivalent of the quantity
                 of LNG which is the difference between the actual quantity on
                 board the LNG Tanker thirty (30) hours after the giving of the
                 Notice of Readiness and the actual quantity on board
                 immediately prior to commencement of loading. If it should
                 appear that the commencement of loading will be delayed beyond
                 thirty (30) hours after Notice of Readiness has been given,
                 Buyer's Transporter shall notify Seller at least three (3)
                 hours prior to the time that it intends to measure the volume
                 of LNG in the LNG Tanker's tanks and Seller shall have the
                 right to have its representative present to witness the
                 measurement. Provided, however, that if Seller should not
                 elect to send a representative on a timely basis, Buyer's
                 Transporter shall proceed to make the measurement and shall
                 notify Buyer and Seller of the results of the measurement
                 promptly upon completion of measuring.

         (b)     If there should become due from Buyer to Buyer's Transporter
                 at any time any payment or payments on account of Buyer's
                 failure to furnish for carriage by Buyer's Transporter
                 sufficient quantities of LNG to fulfill Buyer's obligations
                 under the terms of Buyer's transportation arrangement and if
                 the deficiency is caused by the failure of Seller to fulfill
                 its obligations under this Contract, (for reasons other than
                 Force Majeure) then such amount shall be paid by Seller to
                 Buyer; provided, however, that Seller's payment obligations
                 under this paragraph (b) shall be subject to the following
                 conditions and/or limitations:

                 (i)      Seller's compensation obligations under this
                          paragraph (b) shall be reduced by such amounts as
                          reflect a credit for all revenues earned by the LNG
                          Tanker during the period of its non- utilization
                          under this Contract; and

                 (ii)     the basis for calculating all such payments by Buyer
                          to Buyer's Transporter shall be reasonable when
                          compared with the obligations of Seller under
                          Seller's transportation arrangements in similar
                          circumstances.

         (c)     Buyer shall invoice Seller for amounts due under this
                 Subarticle 4.13 and Seller shall pay the invoice in accordance
                 with the terms of Subarticle 10.3(b).

                             ARTICLE 7 - QUANTITIES

7.1      Fixed Quantity
         During each year (each such period being called a "Fixed Quantity
         Period"), Seller shall sell and deliver to Buyer and Buyer shall
         purchase, receive and pay for, or pay for if not taken, at the
         Contract Sales Price, the quantity of LNG specified for such Fixed
         Quantity Period (each such quantity being called a "Fixed Quantity")
         as follows:

           Year                                       Fixed Quantity
                                               (Billion of BTU's) per year
         ----------------------------------------------------------
         1998 - 2017                                       53,100
         inclusive


         The above Fixed Quantities are subject to adjustment as provided in
         Subarticles 7.3 and 7.6. After giving effect to any such
         adjustment(s), the term "Fixed Quantity" shall mean the applicable
         Fixed Quantity as so adjusted. The respective obligations of Seller to
         sell and deliver and of Buyer to purchase, receive and pay for, or to
         pay for if not taken, a Fixed Quantity of LNG in any Fixed Quantity
         Period shall apply to the applicable Fixed Quantity and Fixed Quantity
         Period, as so adjusted.

7.2      Deliveries
         Within each Fixed Quantity Period the quantities of LNG to be
         delivered by Seller and received by Buyer shall be delivered and
         received at rates and intervals which are reasonably constant over the
         course of such Fixed Quantity Period after taking into consideration
         all commitments of Seller's Facilities and the maintenance, downtime,
         shipping and other matters referred to in Article 12, so as to ensure,
         as nearly as practicable, an even production rate at Seller's
         Facilities.

7.3      Buyer's Obligation to Take-or-Pay
         (a)     If, during any Fixed Quantity Period, Buyer should fail to
                 take the full amount of the Fixed Quantity, as may be adjusted
                 pursuant to this Article 7, Buyer shall pay Seller at the
                 Contract Sales Price in effect as of the last day of such
                 Fixed Quantity Period for the quantities of LNG required to be
                 purchased but which were not taken by Buyer during such Fixed
                 Quantity Period (any such quantity deficiency being called a
                 "Quantity Deficiency"), subject to the following provisions of
                 this Subarticle 7.3:





                                       23
<PAGE>   31
                 (i)      if, after taking into account all adjustments
                          provided in this Subarticle 7.3, including any
                          allowance under Subarticle 7.3(d) that has been
                          exercised, Buyer's Quantity Deficiency at the end of
                          any year amounts to less than one full LNG Tanker
                          Cargo Lot, it will be deemed that no Quantity
                          Deficiency exists for such year and the amount of
                          such Deficiency shall be carried forward and added to
                          Buyer's Fixed Quantity for the next Fixed Quantity
                          Period;

                 (ii)     if, at the time an Annual Program is developed under
                          Subarticle 12.1, it is estimated that Buyer will have
                          a Quantity Deficiency in the year which is the
                          subject of such Annual Program in an amount that is
                          less than a full LNG Tanker Cargo Lot, Buyer shall
                          have the right to request an increase in the quantity
                          which Buyer wishes to take during such subject year
                          in an amount sufficient to fill up such cargo (such
                          right being hereinafter referred to as Buyer's
                          "Round-Up Request"). If Buyer does not make a
                          Round-Up Request or if Seller does not accept such
                          Round-Up Request, the non-delivery of the partial
                          cargo of LNG shall not constitute a failure of Seller
                          to make LNG available for sale for the purpose of
                          Subarticle 7.3(b). No such Round-Up Request shall,
                          however, operate to increase Buyer's Fixed Quantity
                          under this Contract. However, Buyer shall have a
                          take-or-pay obligation in respect of LNG quantities
                          that have been the subject of a Round-Up Request
                          which is accepted by Seller; and

                 (iii)    if at the end of any Fixed Quantity Period Buyer has
                          purchased and received quantities of LNG pursuant to
                          this Article 7 in excess of the Fixed Quantity for
                          such year, other than Make-Up LNG, Make-Good LNG or
                          Restoration Quantities, the excess shall be applied
                          to reduce Buyer's Fixed Quantity during the next
                          Fixed Quantity Period.

         (b)     Buyer's obligation to pay for the Fixed Quantity not taken in
                 any Fixed Quantity Period pursuant to Subarticle 7.3(a) shall
                 be reduced by the quantity of LNG which Buyer was unable to
                 purchase because of Seller's failure to make such quantity
                 available for sale in accordance with the terms of this
                 Contract.

         (c)     In calculating the quantity of LNG delivered by Seller and
                 purchased by Buyer for each Fixed Quantity Period, Seller or
                 Buyer shall include the





                                       24
<PAGE>   32
                 quantity delivered and purchased within the first seven (7)
                 days of the next year, provided such quantity was scheduled in
                 the Annual Program of the Fixed Quantity Period with respect
                 to which the calculation is being made.

         (d)     In calculating its take-or-pay obligations under this
                 Subarticle 7.3, Buyer shall be entitled to allowances
                 ("Allowances", or individually an "Allowance") as follows:

                 (i)      with respect to each Fixed Quantity Period, Buyer
                          shall be entitled to exercise an Allowance of up to
                          two thousand nine hundred and fifty (2,950) billion
                          BTU's. Provided, however, that no Allowance can be
                          exercised if its exercise would result in Buyer's
                          aggregate outstanding Allowances exceeding five
                          thousand nine hundred (5,900) billion BTU's.

                          For the purposes of this Subarticle 7.3(d)(i), and
                          subject to the provisions of Subarticle 7.3(d)(vii),
                          an Allowance, or portion thereof, shall be deemed
                          outstanding until either Make- Good LNG is taken
                          pursuant to Subarticle 7.3(d)(iv), or payment is
                          made, pursuant to Subarticle 7.3(d)(vi). Buyer shall
                          not be obligated to Make-Good a portion of an
                          Allowance which exceeds five (5) percent of Buyer's
                          total Fixed Quantity for the relevant Fixed Quantity
                          Period, solely by reason of either: (A) a decrease in
                          the total Fixed Quantity from one Fixed Quantity
                          Period to the next; or (B) an Allowance being deemed
                          outstanding following Seller's offer to supply
                          requested quantities of LNG pursuant to Subarticle
                          7.3(d)(vii)(B).

                 (ii)     Buyer may only exercise an Allowance by delivering
                          written notice to Seller, as described in Subarticle
                          7.3(d)(iii). A notice of exercise of an Allowance,
                          once given, may not be later withdrawn. Provided,
                          however, that corrections of clerical or arithmetic
                          errors may be made at any time.

                 (iii)    each notice of exercise of an Allowance shall specify
                          the quantity of LNG subject to the Allowance. Such
                          notice shall be delivered to Seller no later than
                          fifteen (15) days after the end of the applicable
                          Fixed Quantity Period to which the Allowance
                          specified in any such notice relates.

<PAGE>   33
                 (iv)     each Allowance shall be made good in full (even if it
                          amounts to a fractional portion of a full LNG Tanker
                          cargo) by the purchase of an equal quantity of LNG
                          ("Make-Good LNG") during the Allowance Restoration
                          Period (defined below) for such Allowance. (Such
                          purchase herein is referred to as "Make-Good" or
                          "Made-Good".) An "Allowance Restoration Period" shall
                          commence on January 1 of the year following the Fixed
                          Quantity Period for which an Allowance was exercised
                          and shall end on the earlier of either: (A) five (5)
                          calendar years thereafter or (B) June 30, 2018.
                          During any Fixed Quantity Period within an Allowance
                          Restoration Period Make-Good LNG may be taken only
                          after the Fixed Quantity for such Fixed Quantity
                          Period has been taken. If Buyer has more than one
                          Allowance outstanding, it shall Make-Good in the same
                          chronological order in which such Allowances were
                          exercised.

                 (v)      for every request for Make-Good LNG, Buyer shall
                          specify the Allowance to which such request relates.

                 (vi)     if, as of the end of the last day of the relevant
                          Allowance Restoration Period, an Allowance has not
                          been Made-Good in full pursuant to Subarticle
                          7.3(d)(iv), Buyer shall pay Seller at the Contract
                          Sales Price in effect on such day for the quantity of
                          LNG for which such Allowance has not been Made-Good.
                          Buyer shall have a right to Make-Up LNG, pursuant to
                          Subarticle 7.5, in respect of such payment.

                 (vii)    in the event that Buyer requests quantities of LNG
                          for Make-Good purposes, pursuant to Subarticle
                          7.3(d)(v), which Seller is unable to make available
                          for any reason including Force Majeure, the following
                          applicable provisions shall apply:

                          (A)     Buyer shall be relieved from the obligation,
                                  under Subarticle 7.3(d)(vi), to pay for such
                                  requested quantity as of the end of the last
                                  day of the Allowance Restoration Period
                                  relating thereto, except as provided in
                                  Subarticle 7.3(d)(vii)(B).

                          (B)     such requested quantities shall not be deemed
                                  outstanding for the purposes of Subarticle
                                  7.3(d)(vi), until Seller shall have offered
                                  the same to Buyer (whether during, or after

                                  not accepted such offer, in which event such
                                  requested quantity shall then be deemed
                                  outstanding for the purposes of Subarticle
                                  7.3(d)(vi).

                          (C)     such requested quantities may be scheduled
                                  for delivery at any time prior to the
                                  expiration of the last Fixed Quantity Period,
                                  as mutually agreed by Seller and Buyer.
                                  Provided, however, that such requested
                                  quantities shall be delivered and taken by
                                  June 30, 2018 and paid for in accordance with
                                  Subarticle 10.3(b). If such requested
                                  quantities cannot be delivered by June 30,
                                  2018, then Buyer shall have no further
                                  obligation to Make-Good any Allowance
                                  exercised with respect to such requested
                                  quantities, or to pay for such requested
                                  quantities.

                 (viii)   Seller shall not be obligated to reserve any LNG
                          production or shipping capacity for the purposes of
                          permitting Buyer to satisfy Make-Good obligations.

         (e)     A reduction shall be made to any Quantity Deficiency equal to
                 the amount by which such Quantity Deficiency resulted from a
                 partial loading of an LNG Tanker during the relevant Fixed
                 Quantity Period due to reasons attributable to Seller.

7.4      Force Majeure - Allocation of Deliveries Between Buyer and Other
         Purchasers 
         (a)     Whenever deliveries of LNG by Seller are reduced
                 below the applicable Fixed Quantities to be delivered
                 hereunder by reason of an event or circumstance of Force
                 Majeure affecting Seller's Facilities, an allocation of LNG
                 then capable of being delivered from Seller's Facilities will
                 be made between Buyer and other purchasers of LNG from
                 Seller's Facilities. At such times, the total quantities
                 capable of being delivered from Seller's Facilities shall be
                 allocated among the purchasers from Seller's Facilities
                 (including Buyer) pro-rata in the ratio of their respective
                 quantities which are eligible for allocation, as provided
                 below. The quantities eligible for such allocation shall be,
                 as to Buyer, the portion of the Fixed Quantities to be
                 purchased hereunder during the period of such Force Majeure
                 and, as to other purchasers, be those fixed or contract
                 quantities of LNG which are committed for sale from Seller's
                 Facilities during the period of such Force Majeure in
                 satisfaction of Seller's contracts with other purchasers which
                 provide for sales of LNG from Seller's Facilities over a term
                 of at least fifteen (15) years.

<PAGE>   35
         (b)     If such an event of Force Majeure does not preclude full
                 production and loading of all Fixed Quantities under the
                 allocation formula described in Subarticle 7.4(a), but is of
                 such an extent as to prevent Seller from producing and loading
                 all Make-Good LNG, Make-Up LNG and Restoration Quantities
                 scheduled for delivery from Seller's Facilities to Buyer and
                 LNG for the same purposes scheduled for delivery from Seller's
                 Facilities to other purchasers under sales contracts providing
                 for deliveries over a term of at least fifteen (15) years,
                 quantities of such LNG as are available shall be allocated
                 between Buyer and such other purchasers in proportion to the
                 respective quantities so scheduled.

7.5      Make-Up LNG
         (a)     (i)      if, pursuant to Subarticles 7.3(a) or 7.3(d)(vi),
                          Buyer shall have paid for any Quantity Deficiency not
                          taken ("Take-or-Pay Quantity"), then during any
                          subsequent year Buyer may purchase up to an equal
                          quantity of LNG from Seller as make-up LNG ("Make-Up
                          LNG") to the extent not previously made up. Buyer
                          must request Make-Up LNG by notice to Seller in
                          accordance with Subarticle 12.1.

                 (ii)     upon Buyer's request for Make-Up LNG, Seller shall
                          sell such quantity provided:

                          (A)     Seller has uncommitted LNG available for such
                                  purpose; and

                          (B)     Buyer has first taken and paid for its Fixed
                                  Quantity for the year in which deliveries of
                                  Make-Up LNG are requested.

                 (iii)    Buyer's right to take delivery of Make-Up LNG under
                          this Subarticle 7.5 shall expire on December 31,
                          2017.

                 (iv)     if Buyer shall have requested Make-Up LNG during the
                          twelve (12) months prior to December 31, 2017 and
                          Seller shall have had insufficient uncommitted LNG to
                          fulfill such request, then in such circumstances, the
                          Parties shall consult and agree upon a deferred
                          schedule for Buyer to take delivery of any
                          outstanding balance of Take-or-Pay Quantity.





                                       28
<PAGE>   36
         (b)     Buyer shall pay for Make-Up LNG at the Contract Sales Price in
                 effect as of the date of delivery, reduced by the amount
                 previously paid on account of the Take-or-Pay Quantity or the
                 part thereof being made up by such sale.

         (c)     Take-or-Pay Quantities shall be made up and prior payments
                 applicable thereto applied in the same chronological order in
                 which such quantities were incurred.

7.6      Force Majeure Deficiency
         (a)     (i)      if during any Fixed Quantity Period all or any
                          portion of the Fixed Quantity required to be
                          delivered to and taken by Buyer during such Fixed
                          Quantity Period is not delivered to and taken by
                          Buyer by reason of Force Majeure (any such quantity
                          not delivered and taken being a "Force Majeure
                          Deficiency"), Buyer may, thereafter, request that
                          all, or a part of such Force Majeure Deficiency be
                          delivered as restoration quantities ("Restoration
                          Quantities") during a subsequent Fixed Quantity
                          Period. The Restoration Quantities so agreed will be
                          scheduled for delivery pursuant to Article 12 at the
                          mutual convenience of the Parties and shall be paid
                          for by Buyer at the Contract Sales Price in effect as
                          of the date of delivery.

                 (ii)     Seller and Buyer shall each make best efforts to
                          restore the Force Majeure Deficiency in full by
                          Seller selling and Buyer purchasing such quantities
                          of LNG prior to the expiration of the last Fixed
                          Quantity Period. In the event that, despite such best
                          efforts, Seller fails to deliver or Buyer fails to
                          take delivery of the outstanding Restoration
                          Quantities by the end of 2017, then any obligation of
                          Seller to deliver and Buyer to take delivery of such
                          Restoration Quantities shall cease on such date.

         (b)     If an event of Force Majeure relieves or delays Buyer's
                 performance of its obligations under this Contract and causes
                 a reduction in deliveries of LNG to Buyer and if Seller sells
                 to third parties quantities of LNG which Buyer is unable to
                 purchase, then the Force Majeure Deficiency shall be reduced,
                 up to the quantities so sold, by the amount, if any, that the
                 Seller's Gas Supply Obligation (including amounts so sold to
                 third parties) exceeds the estimate of Proved Remaining
                 Recoverable Reserves stated in the most recent Certificate as
                 a result of such sales.

7.7      Allocation for Make-Up LNG, Make-Good LNG and Restoration Quantities
         Whenever Buyer requests either: Make-Good LNG under Subarticle
         7.3(d)(iv), Make-Up LNG under Subarticle 7.5 and/or Restoration
         Quantities under Subarticle 7.6, and quantities of LNG are requested
         for the same purposes by other purchasers from Seller's Facilities
         (under LNG sales contracts with Seller with terms of at least fifteen
         (15) years) and there is insufficient uncommitted LNG at Seller's
         Facilities to meet all such requests, then the LNG which is available
         for such purposes shall be allocated, as between Buyer on the one hand
         and such other requesting purchasers on the other hand, in the same
         proportion that each such purchaser's portion of its Fixed Quantity to
         be purchased from Seller's Facilities for the year of requested
         delivery bears to the total of all requesting purchasers' (including
         Buyer) Fixed Quantities to be purchased from Seller's Facilities for
         that year.

7.8      Priority Order
         Make-Good LNG under Subarticle 7.3(d)(iv), Make-Up LNG under
         Subarticle 7.5 and Restoration Quantities under Subarticle 7.6 shall
         be delivered and taken in the following order:

         (i)     Make-Up LNG;
         (ii)    Make-Good LNG; and
         (iii)   Restoration Quantities.

         provided, however, that Buyer shall have the option to change the
         order of (i) and (ii) above, upon notice to Seller.

                 where:

                          CSP      =       the Contract Sales Price (expressed 
                                           in US$/MMBTU);

                          Po       =       US$ 3.06/MMBTU;

                          A        =       the arithmetic average of the

         (b)     An adjustment of the Contract Sales Price to reflect any
                 change in USCPI shall be made on and shall be effective as of
                 January 1 of each year, and further adjustments of the
                 Contract Sales Price shall be made as of each effective date

                          field classifications of Indonesian crude oils sold
                          by PERTAMINA shall have changed from the respective
                          prices therefor included in the last preceding
                          determination of "A" made pursuant to Subarticle 8.2

                 Procedures for verifying changes in the realized export prices
                 of all Indonesian crude oils and for determining the effective
                 date of any adjustment of the Contract Sales Price shall be
                 agreed upon by Seller and Buyer.

         (c)     Seller and Buyer shall agree a procedure for handling
                 corrections, revisions or changes in the calculation of USCPI.
                 It is agreed that if at any time the US Department of Labor,
                 Bureau of Labor Statistics discontinues publishing a report on
                 USCPI values, then Seller and Buyer shall agree upon an index
                 method that reflects inflation in the United States of
                 America's consumer prices to replace the discontinued USCPI
                 report.

                       ARTICLE 10 - INVOICES AND PAYMENT

10.1     Invoices and Cargo Documents
         Promptly after completion of loading of each LNG Tanker, Seller or its
         representative shall furnish Buyer or Buyer's representative a
         certificate of volume loaded, together with such other documents
         concerning the cargo as may be reasonably requested by Buyer for the
         purpose of Korean customs clearance. Seller shall within forty- eight
         (48) hours of completing loading complete a laboratory analysis and
         calculations to determine the quality and BTU content of the LNG
         loaded and shall promptly furnish to Buyer, or Buyer's representative,
         a certificate with respect thereto together with details of the
         calculation of the number of BTU's loaded and sold. Promptly upon
         completion of such analysis and calculation, Seller or its
         representative shall furnish Buyer by telex, facsimile or telegram, an
         invoice, stated in US Dollars, in the amount of the Contract Sales
         Price for the number of BTU's delivered and sold. At the same time
         Seller shall send to Buyer a signed copy of the invoice and relevant
         documents showing the basis for the calculation thereof.

10.2     Other Invoices
         In the event that any moneys are due from one Party to the other
         hereunder, including, without limitation, amounts payable pursuant to
         Subarticle 7.3 on account of Fixed Quantities of LNG required to be
         purchased but which were not taken by Buyer, then the Party to whom
         such moneys are owed shall furnish an invoice therefor, together with
         relevant supporting documents showing the basis for the calculation
         thereof. The procedure set forth in Subarticle 10.1 for sending
         invoices shall be followed.

10.3     Invoice Due Dates
         (a)     Each invoice for LNG delivered to Buyer pursuant to Subarticle
                 10.1 shall become due and payable by Buyer on the eighth (8th)
                 Business Day in Korea after the date on which the invoice has
                 been received by Buyer in Korea. For this purpose, a telex,
                 facsimile or telegraphic copy of an invoice shall be deemed
                 received by Buyer on the next Business Day in Korea following
                 the day in which it was sent.

         (b)     Except as otherwise expressly provided in this Contract, each
                 invoice sent pursuant to Subarticle 10.2 shall become due and
                 payable by the Party receiving the invoice within twenty (20)
                 calendar days after the date of receipt of such invoice.





                                       34
<PAGE>   42
         (c)     (i)      if any invoice to Buyer has a due date that is not a
                          Business Day in Korea, such invoice shall become due
                          and payable by Buyer on the next Business Day in
                          Korea.

                 (ii)     if any invoice to Seller has a due date that is not a
                          Business Day in Indonesia, such invoice shall become
                          due and payable by Seller on the next Business Day in
                          Indonesia.

         (d)     In the event the full amount of any invoice is not paid when
                 due, any unpaid amount thereof shall bear interest from the
                 due date until paid, at an interest rate, compounded annually,
                 two percent (2%) greater than the rate, or rates, being
                 charged during the period of delinquency by Citibank, N.A.,
                 New York to its prime commercial customers for ninety (90) day
                 loans. Such interest rate shall be adjusted up or down, as the
                 case may be, to reflect any changes in the aforesaid prime
                 rate as of the dates of such changes in the prime rate. In the
                 event that Citibank, N.A. shall for any reason cease quoting a
                 prime rate as described above, then a comparable rate shall be
                 determined using rates then in effect and shall be used in
                 place of the said prime rate.

10.4     Payment
         (a)     Buyer shall pay, or cause to be paid, in US Dollars, all
                 amounts which become due and payable by Buyer pursuant to an
                 invoice issued hereunder, to a bank account or accounts in the
                 United States of America designated by Seller. Buyer shall not
                 be responsible for the designated bank's disbursement of
                 amounts remitted by Buyer to such bank, and Buyer's deposit in
                 immediately available funds of the full amount of each invoice
                 with such bank shall constitute full discharge and
                 satisfaction of the obligations under this Contract for which
                 such amounts were remitted. Each payment by Buyer of any
                 amount owing hereunder shall be in the full amount due,
                 without reduction or offset for any reason including, without
                 limitation, taxes, exchange charges or bank transfer charges.

         (b)     Transfer of funds to the bank in the United States of America
                 referred to in paragraph (a) above, effected from Korea before
                 the close of business in Korea on or before the due date of
                 any invoice, shall be deemed timely payment, notwithstanding
                 that such United States of America bank cannot credit such
                 transfer as immediately available funds for a period of up to
                 fourteen (14) hours by reason of the time difference between
                 Korea and the United States of America, or for one or more
                 days which





                                       35
<PAGE>   43
                 are not days when banks are open for business in the United
                 States of America.

         (c)     Seller shall pay, or cause to be paid, in US Dollars the
                 amounts which become due and payable by Seller pursuant to a
                 Subarticle 10.2 invoice to an account with a bank designated
                 by Buyer. Seller shall not be responsible for the designated
                 bank's disbursement of funds by Seller to Buyer pursuant to
                 this paragraph (c).

10.5     Seller's Rights Upon Buyer's Failure to Make Payment
         If payment of any invoice for quantities of LNG delivered hereunder or
         for the Fixed Quantity of LNG not taken and for which Buyer is
         obligated to pay pursuant to this Contract is not made within sixty
         (60) days after the due date thereof, Seller shall be entitled, upon
         giving thirty (30) days written notice to Buyer, to suspend subsequent
         deliveries to Buyer until the amount of such invoice, together with
         interest thereon have been paid, and Buyer shall not be entitled to
         any make-up rights in respect of such suspended deliveries. If any
         such invoice is not paid within one hundred and twenty (120) days
         after the due date thereof, then Seller shall have the right, at
         Seller's election, upon not less than eighty (80) days notice to Buyer
         to terminate this Contract, and such termination shall become
         effective upon the date specified in such notice from Seller. Any such
         termination shall be without prejudice to any other rights and
         remedies of Seller arising hereunder, or by law, or otherwise,
         including the right of Seller to receive payment of all obligations
         and claims which arose or accrued prior to such termination, or by
         reason of such default by Buyer.

10.6     Disputed Invoices
         In the event of disagreement concerning any invoice, Buyer or Seller,
         as the case may be, shall make provisional payment of the total amount
         thereof and shall immediately notify the other Party of the reasons
         for such disagreement, except that in the case of obvious error in
         computation Buyer or Seller, as the case may be, shall pay the correct
         amount after disregarding such error. Invoices may be contested by
         Buyer or Seller, as the case may be, or modified only if, within a
         period of ninety (90) days after receipt thereof, the disputing Party
         serves notice on the other Party questioning their correctness. If no
         such notice is served, such invoice shall be deemed correct and
         accepted by both Parties. Promptly after resolution of any dispute as
         to an invoice, the amount of any overpayment or underpayment shall be
         paid by Seller or Buyer, as the case may be, to the other together
         with interest at the rate provided in Subarticle 10.3(d) from the date
         payment was due to the date of payment.

<PAGE>   44
                              ARTICLE 11 - QUALITY

11.1     Gross Heating Value
         The LNG when delivered by Seller to Buyer shall have, in a gaseous
         state, a Gross Heating Value of not less than 1,065 BTU's per Standard
         Cubic Foot and not more than 1,180 BTU's per Standard Cubic Foot.

11.2     Components
         (a)     The LNG delivered by Seller to Buyer shall, in a gaseous
                 state, contain not less than eighty-five molecular percentage
                 (85 mol%) of methane (CH4) and, for the components and
                 substances listed below, such LNG shall not contain more than
                 the following:

                 (i)      Nitrogen (N2), 1.0 mol%.

                 (ii)     Butanes (C4) and heavier, 2.00 mol%.

                 (iii)    Pentanes (C5) and heavier, 0.10 mol%.

                 (iv)     Hydrogen Sulfide (H2S), 0.25 grains per 100 Standard
                          Cubic Feet (0.25 grains/100 scf).

                 (v)      Total sulfur content, 1.3 grains per 100 Standard
                          Cubic Feet (1.3 grains/100 scf).

                 Although the LNG which Seller delivers to Buyer is permitted
                 to contain the sulfur concentrations shown in sub-paragraphs
                 (iv) and (v) above, under normal operating conditions at
                 Seller's Facilities, Seller would expect such concentrations
                 to be materially less.

         (b)     Should any question regarding quality of the LNG arise, Seller
                 and Buyer shall consult and cooperate concerning such question
                 and the proper action to be taken.

                     ARTICLE 12 - PROGRAMMING OF DELIVERIES

12.1     Annual Programs
         Not later than ninety (90) days prior to the beginning of each year
         commencing with 1998 (the first Fixed Quantity Period), Seller shall
         give written notice to Buyer of the anticipated quantities of LNG
         available for delivery hereunder in each calendar quarter of the
         succeeding year from Seller's Facilities and specifying any scheduled
         downtime of Seller's Facilities.

         On or before October 15 of each year in which such notice is given,
         Buyer shall advise Seller in writing of the quantities Buyer wishes to
         take during each quarter of the succeeding year and, to the extent
         practicable, specifying the amount of any Make-Good LNG (for previous
         Allowances), Restoration Quantities (for previous Force Majeure
         Deficiencies), and Make-Up LNG (for previous Quantity Deficiencies)
         and advising as to any planned downtime for Buyer's Facilities;
         provided, however, that as to Make-Good LNG, Restoration Quantities or
         Make-Up LNG, such advice may be given up to January 15 of the year
         succeeding the notice year and the Annual Program (as defined below)
         shall be amended as promptly as practicable to reflect such late
         advice. Seller and Buyer shall consult together with a view to
         reaching agreement by December 1 of the notice year and thereafter
         Seller shall issue a programming schedule, including projected dates
         for quantities to be loaded in full LNG Tanker Cargo Lots at Seller's
         Facilities during each month of the succeeding year ("Annual
         Program"). In so doing, Seller shall take into consideration the
         contents of the above notices and the Coordinated Maintenance Schedule
         (as defined in Subarticle 12.3, below).

         The Annual Program shall take into account Seller's commitments to
         other purchasers of LNG from Seller's Facilities. The Annual Program
         and the Ninety-Day Schedule referred to in Subarticle 12.2 (together
         with any revision to each), are intended to assist the Parties in
         planning their respective operations during the periods involved and
         shall not reduce the entitlement of either Party during any Fixed
         Quantity Period to sell, deliver and be paid for, or to purchase and
         receive, as the case may be, the quantities of LNG required under
         Article 7.

12.2     Ninety-Day Schedule
         Not later than the 15th day of each month Seller shall, after
         discussion with Buyer, deliver to Buyer a three (3) month forward plan
         of deliveries ("Ninety-Day Schedule") which follows the applicable
         Annual Program (or most current draft thereof) as nearly as
         practicable. Each Ninety-Day Schedule shall reflect all adjustments,
         if any, necessitated by deviation from the prior Ninety-Day





                                       38
<PAGE>   46
         Schedule so as to maintain, as far as practicable, the scheduled
         loadings forecast in the Annual Program. Both Parties shall cooperate
         to facilitate smooth performance of the Ninety-Day Schedule. After
         consultation with Buyer, Seller shall revise the Ninety-Day Schedule,
         when appropriate, to meet operational requirements with the overall
         objective of fulfilling the Annual Program as far as practicable,
         taking into account any requests of Buyer for adjustments.

12.3     Maintenance and Inspection Coordination
         Not later than ninety (90) days prior to the beginning of each year,
         Seller and Buyer shall consult and agree on a program designed to
         coordinate the anticipated scheduled maintenance/inspection downtime
         during that year of: (a) Buyer's Facilities; (b) Seller's Facilities;
         and (c) the LNG Tanker. Such program ("Coordinated Maintenance
         Schedule") will be established so as to minimize the collective impact
         of such downtime periods on the delivery of LNG hereunder.

         existing LNG trade shall be chosen by mutual agreement of the Parties
         and shall be such as are, at the time of selection, the most accurate
         and reliable in their practical application. The required degree of
         accuracy of such devices selected shall be mutually agreed upon and
         verified by Buyer and Seller in advance of their use, and such degree
         of accuracy shall be verified by an independent surveyor who is
         mutually agreed upon by Buyer and Seller. All such devices shall be
         subject to approval by the appropriate Indonesian and Korean
         governmental authorities.

13.3     Units of Measurement and Calibration
         The Parties shall cooperate closely in the design, selection and
         acquisition of devices to be used for measurements and tests under

         certified copy of tank gauge tables as described in Section 2 of
         Schedule A for each tank of each LNG Tanker.

13.5     Gauging and Measuring LNG Volumes Delivered
         Volumes of LNG delivered under this Contract will be determined by
         gauging the LNG in the tanks of the LNG Tanker immediately before and
         after loading. Gauging the liquid in the tanks of the LNG Tanker and
         measuring of liquid temperature, vapor temperature, and absolute vapor
         pressure in each LNG tank and trim and list of the LNG Tanker shall be
         performed, or caused to be performed, by Buyer before and after
         loading. The first gauging and measurements shall be made immediately
         before the commencement of loading. The second gauging and measurement
         shall take place immediately after completion of loading. Copies of
         gauging and measurement records shall be furnished to Seller. Gauging
         devices shall be selected, and measurements shall be effected, in
         accordance with the terms of Sections 3 and 4 of Schedule A.

 13.8    Operating Procedures
         All measurements, gauging and analyses provided for in Subarticles
         13.5, 13.6 and 13.7, shall be witnessed and verified by an independent
         surveyor who is mutually agreed upon by Buyer and Seller. Prior to
         effecting such measurements, gauging and analyses the Party
         responsible for such operations shall notify the surveyor, allowing
         such surveyor a reasonable opportunity to be present for all
         operations and computations; provided, however, that the absence of
         the surveyor after notification and opportunity to attend shall not
         prevent any operation or computation from being performed. The results
         of such surveyor's verifications shall be made available promptly to
         each Party. All records of measurements and the computation results
         shall be preserved by the Party responsible for effecting such
         measurements and held available to the other Party for a period of not
         less than three (3) years after such measurements and computations
         have been completed.

13.9     BTU Quantity Delivered
         The quantity of BTU's sold and delivered shall be calculated by Seller
         following the procedures set forth in Section 6 of Schedule A and
         shall be verified by an independent surveyor mutually agreed upon by
         Seller and Buyer.

13.10    Verification of Accuracy and Correction for Error
         (a)     Each Party shall test and verify the accuracy of its gauging
                 devices at intervals to be agreed between the Parties. In the
                 case of gauging devices on the LNG Tanker such tests and
                 verifications shall take place during scheduled drydocking
                 periods. Each Party shall have the right to inspect at any
                 time the gauging devices installed by the other Party,
                 provided that the other Party shall be notified in advance.
                 Testing shall be performed using methods recommended by the
                 manufacturer or any other method agreed upon by Seller and
                 Buyer. Tests shall be witnessed and verified by an independent
                 surveyor who is mutually agreed upon by Buyer and Seller.

         (b)     Permissible tolerances shall be as described in Section 3 of
                 Schedule A. Inaccuracy of a device exceeding the permissible
                 tolerances shall require correction of recordings, and
                 computations made on the basis of those recordings, to correct
                 all errors with respect to any period which is definitely
                 known or agreed upon by the Parties, as well as adjustment of
                 the device. In the event that the period of error is neither
                 known nor agreed upon, corrections shall be made for each
                 delivery made during the last half of the period since the
                 date of the most recent calibration of the inaccurate device.
                 However, the provisions of this Subarticle 13.10 shall

         and verifying Buyer's measurement devices shall be borne by Buyer. The
         fees and charges of independent surveyors for measurements and
         calculations shall be borne equally between Seller and Buyer.

15.2     Notice, Resumption of Normal Performance
         (a)     Immediately upon the occurrence of an event of Force Majeure

4.4 Obligations of Buyer at Unloading Port

    (a)  Buyer shall cooperate with the Master of an LNG Tanker directed to the
         Unloading Port to ensure the continuous and efficient delivery of LNG
         hereunder. Buyer shall provide, in accordance with the provisions of
         this Contract, a safe berth for prompt berthing of an LNG Tanker at
         Buyer's Facilities and shall operate Buyer's Facilities, or ensure
         that they are operated, so as to permit discharge of the Cargo of an
         LNG Tanker as quickly as possible. During discharge of each Cargo of
         LNG, Buyer shall return to the LNG Tanker natural gas in such
         quantities as are necessary for the safe unloading of the LNG at such
         rates, pressures and temperatures as may be required by the LNG Tanker
         design and commonly accepted operating practice for such LNG Tanker.
         The LNG to be sold and delivered hereunder shall be unloaded through
         manifold strainers of sixty (60) mesh (or such other mesh as shall be
         agreed from time to time by the Parties).

    (b)  Buyer shall cause to be made available at an Unloading Port such tugs,
         fireboats, pilots and other services as are necessary for the purposes
         of safety and efficiency and are required by Taiwan authorities.

    (c)  Seller shall pay, or shall cause Seller's Transporter to pay, all Port
         Charges in respect of LNG Tankers at the Unloading Port promptly when
         due, provided that Buyer shall reimburse to Seller the amount (if any)
         by which such Port Charges exceed the average of those generally
         payable for vessels of the same type and size in LNG unloading ports
         in Japan.

4.5 Demurrage at Unloading Port

    (a)  Upon the arrival of an LNG Tanker at an Unloading Port (or off the
         Unloading Port if such LNG Tanker is prohibited from approaching or
         entering the Unloading Port by applicable safety regulations) the
         Master of the LNG Tanker or its agent shall give notice to Buyer or
         its agent that such LNG Tanker is ready to discharge LNG, berth or no
         berth ("Notice of Readiness"). A Notice of Readiness may be tendered
         on any day of the week or any hour of the day.  Laytime used in
         unloading an LNG Tanker ("Used Laytime") shall begin to count upon the
         earlier of (i) four (4) hours from Notice of Readiness, except where
         such Notice of Readiness is given when the LNG Tanker is prevented
         from berthing because of night berthing restrictions in which case
<PAGE>   18
         it shall begin to count from four (4) hours after the sunrise
         following such Notice of Readiness, or (ii) the LNG Tanker's being
         "all fast" in berth.  Used Laytime shall continue to run until
         discharge and return lines have been disconnected and the LNG Tanker
         is cleared for departure.

    (b)  "Allowed Laytime" at an Unloading Port shall be twenty-four (24)
         consecutive hours extended by any period of delay which is caused by:

         (i)     reasons attributable to Seller, the LNG Tanker or its Master,
                 crew, owner or operator, including but not limited to delays
                 in departure due to quarantine, port regulation or documentary
                 clearance to the extent so attributable;

         (ii)    prevention or delay in an LNG Tanker attaining its full design
                 discharge rate because of the condition of the Cargo;

         (iii)   Force Majeure;

         (iv)    occupancy of the berth by another vessel if the LNG Tanker
                 arrives more than one (1) day after the delivery date
                 scheduled in the most recent Ninety-Day Schedule without the
                 consent of Buyer; provided that such period of extension shall
                 be equal to the lesser of (A) twenty-four (24) hours, or (B)
                 the time elapsed between Notice of Readiness and the departure
                 from the berth of such other vessel;

         (v)     arrival of the LNG Tanker before the delivery date scheduled
                 in the most recent Ninety-Day Schedule without the consent of
                 the Buyer; provided that such period of extension shall be
                 equal to the time elapsed (if any) between commencement of
                 used laytime and the earlier of (A) 00:00 hours on the
                 scheduled delivery date, or (B) completion of berthing; or

         (vi)    "Adverse Weather Conditions", which for purposes hereof means
                 weather and/or sea conditions actually experienced at the
                 Unloading Port which are sufficiently severe either: (A) to
                 prevent all LNG Tankers from proceeding to berth, discharging
                 or departing from berth in accordance with the weather
                 standards prescribed in the standard published regulations of
                 the maritime agency of Taiwan, or (B) to cause an actual
                 determination by the Master that it is unsafe for the LNG
                 Tanker to berth, discharge or depart from berth. The
<PAGE>   19
                 period of delay to an LNG Tanker caused by Adverse Weather
                 Conditions shall not be considered to extend past the time
                 during which such Adverse Weather Conditions actually
                 prevailed except where additional delay is caused by the
                 occupation of the berth by another LNG Tanker.

    (c)  In the event Used Laytime exceeds Allowed Laytime (such excess being
         herein referred to as "Excess Laytime"), Buyer shall pay to Seller
         demurrage determined in accordance with  the following formula:

                         (TE - U.S.$0.12 / MMBTU) x Cargo
                         --------------------------------  x Days
                                       10

         where :

         TE      =        the Transportation Element applicable at the time the
                          demurrage occurs;

         Days    =        the duration in days (or parts thereof) of the Excess
                          Laytime.

    provided, however, that demurrage shall only be payable under this Section
    4.5 (c) to the extent that an event of Excess Laytime ("Event") exceeds a
    certain allowance period ("Excess Laytime Allowance"). Such Excess Laytime
    Allowance shall be limited to:

         (i)     six (6) hours per Event; and

         (ii)    twelve (12) hours in the aggregate for all prior Events during
                 a period of sixty (60) days ending on the date the Event in
                 question arises.

    Seller shall invoice Buyer for demurrage amounts due under this Section 4.5
    at the end of each calendar month, and Buyer shall pay such invoices in
    accordance with the terms of Section 10.2.

4.6      Effect of Unloading Port Delays; Excess Boil-Off

         (a)     Notwithstanding the provisions of Section 11.1, if the Gross
                 Heating Value of LNG to be delivered hereunder is higher than
                 the limits set forth in Section 11.1 by reason of boil-off
                 occurring during a delay in unloading an LNG Tanker of more
                 than forty-eight (48) hours after
<PAGE>   20
                 Notice of Readiness has been given, such LNG shall be deemed
                 to have met the quality specifications of this Contract
                 regarding the Gross Heating Value.

         (b)     If an LNG Tanker is delayed in berthing and/or commencement of
                 unloading for a reason that would not result in an extension
                 of allowed laytime under Section 4.5(b), and if, as a result
                 thereof, the commencement of unloading is delayed beyond
                 thirty (30) hours after Notice of Readiness has been given,
                 then, for each full hour by which commencement of unloading is
                 delayed beyond such thirty (30) hour period, Buyer shall pay
                 Seller an amount, on account of excess boil-off, equal to the
                 Contract Sales Price multiplied by the number of MMBTUs per
                 hour by which such boil-off reduces the aggregate number of
                 BTUs of a Cargo at berth, provided, however, that Buyer shall
                 not pay for any boil-off which exceeds the boil-off
                 performance undertaking by Seller's Transporter as agreed
                 under Seller's Transportation Arrangements for the applicable
                 LNG Tanker. The hourly BTU reduction rate to be applied for
                 such purpose shall be determined by actual boil-off experience
                 as determined at appropriate intervals.

4.7      Non-Utilization Cost

         (a)     If there is an event of force majeure pursuant to Section 15.1
                 affecting  Buyer's performance of its obligations hereunder
                 ("Buyer Force Majeure") which results in an LNG Tanker being
                 unutilized and there is an expected Force Majeure Deficiency,
                 then Buyer shall pay to Seller on account of such non-
                 utilization an amount in U.S.$ ("Non-Utilization Cost")
                 determined in accordance with the following formula:

                                       FMD  x  (TE - U.S. $0.12/MMBTU)
                 Where:

                 FMD      =       the Force Majeure Deficiency resulting from a
                                  Buyer Force Majeure in MMBTUs; and

                 TE       =       Transportation Element applicable at the time
                                  such Force Majeure Deficiency occurs.

         (b)     Any Non-Utilization Cost payable hereunder shall be reduced to
                 the extent that the LNG Tanker is utilized to deliver to a
                 third party LNG
<PAGE>   21
                 which would otherwise have been purchased and received by
                 Buyer had a Buyer Force Majeure not occured.

         (c)     Seller shall invoice Buyer for amounts due under this Section
                 4.7 on a monthly basis and Buyer shall pay such invoice in
                 accordance with Section 10.2.

         production and treatment facilities in and transportation facilities
         from the Gas Supply Area including without limitation those facilities
         located at Bontang Bay, East Kalimantan for treatment, compression,
         liquefaction, processing, transmission, storage, berthing and loading,
         and utilities, together with such expansion or modification of the
         foregoing as may be necessary, to fulfill its obligations hereunder
         ("Seller's Facilities").

5.3      Compatibility of Buyer's Facilities and LNG Tankers

         modification of Buyer's Facilities after the effective date of this
         Contract, in addition to meeting the requirements of Section 5.1, is
         compatible with the LNG Tankers.

    (c)  Seller and Buyer shall consult to determine the most effective manner
         to achieve the  compatibility referred in (a) and (b) above;
         provided, however, that Buyer shall have the right to request
         modifications to the LNG Tanker to be carried out entirely at Buyer's
         expense and such request shall not be unreasonably refused.

5.4      Fuel, Liquid Nitrogen and Fresh Water

         Buyer, at no cost to Seller, shall provide at Buyer's Facilities

         the supply of the requirements of an LNG Tanker for liquid nitrogen
         and fresh water.  Subject to reasonable advance notice (not in any
         event to be less than seven (7) days) prior to arrival of an LNG
         Tanker, Buyer shall at all times during the term of this Contract
         cause adequate supplies of such products to meet the requirements of

<PAGE>   24
         sale at Buyer's Facilities on the terms and conditions generally
         prevailing for long-term contracts for such items in ports in Taiwan.

7.1      Required Deliveries

         During each calendar year specified below (each such period being
         called a "Fixed Quantity Period"), Seller shall sell and deliver to
         Buyer, and Buyer shall purchase, receive and pay for, or pay for if
         not taken, at the Contract Sales Price, the quantity of LNG having a
         heating value as specified for such Fixed Quantity Period (each such
         quantity being called a "Fixed Quantity") as follows:

<TABLE>
<CAPTION>
         FIXED QUANTITY PERIOD                                FIXED QUANTITIES
         (CALENDAR YEAR)                                     (BILLIONS OF BTUS)

         <S>                                                        <C>
         1998                                                        5,187
         1999                                                       38,903

         2001-2017                                                  95,500
</TABLE>

         The above Fixed Quantities are subject to adjustment as provided in
         Section 7.3(a). After giving effect to any such adjustment, the term
         "Fixed Quantity" shall mean the applicable Fixed Quantity as so
         adjusted, and the respective obligations of Seller to sell and
         deliver, and of Buyer to purchase, receive and pay for, or pay for if
         not taken, the Fixed Quantity of LNG in any Fixed Quantity Period
         shall apply to the applicable Fixed Quantity as so adjusted.

7.2      Deliveries

         Within each Fixed Quantity Period, the quantities to be delivered by
         Seller and received by Buyer shall be delivered at rates and intervals
         and in quantities which are reasonably constant over the course of
         such Fixed Quantity Period and give effect to the maintenance,
         downtime and shipping schedules provided for in Article 12, so as to
         assure, as nearly as possible, continuous full utilization of the LNG
         Tankers, an even production rate at Seller's Facilities, and even
         rates of deliveries at Buyer's Facilities.

7.3      Buyer's Obligation to Take or Pay

         (a)     If, during any Fixed Quantity Period, Buyer should fail to
                 take the full Fixed Quantity applicable thereto, Buyer shall
                 pay Seller, at the Contract Sales Price in effect as of the
                 last day of such Fixed Quantity Period, for
<PAGE>   27
                 the quantities of LNG required to be purchased but which were
                 not taken by Buyer during such Fixed Quantity Period (any such
                 quantity deficiency being called a "Quantity Deficiency"),
                 subject, however, to paragraphs (b), (c) and (d) below and the
                 following:

                 (i)      if, after taking into account all adjustments
                          provided for in this Section 7.3 including any
                          Allowance that has been exercised, there remains a
                          Quantity Deficiency for Buyer at the end of any Fixed
                          Quantity Period, Buyer may carry forward and add to
                          the Fixed Quantity for the next succeeding Fixed
                          Quantity Period:

                          (A)     the full amount when such Quantity Deficiency
                                  amounts to less than a Cargo; or

                          (B)     any fractional portion of a Cargo when the
                                  Quantity Deficiency exceeds a Cargo.

                          Amounts so carried forward shall not be included in
                          such Quantity Deficiency.

                 (ii)     if, at the time an Annual Program is developed under
                          Section 12.1, it is estimated that Buyer will have a
                          Quantity Deficiency in the year which is the subject
                          of such Annual Program in an amount that is less than
                          a Cargo, Buyer shall have the right to request an
                          increase in the quantity which Buyer wishes to take
                          during such subject year in an amount sufficient to
                          fill up such Cargo (such right being hereinafter
                          referred to as Buyer's "Round-Up Request"). If Buyer
                          does not make a Round-Up Request or if Seller does
                          not accept such Round-Up Request, the non- delivery
                          of the partial Cargo of LNG shall not constitute a
                          failure of Seller to make LNG available for sale for
                          the purpose of Section 7.3(b). No such Round-Up
                          Request shall, however, operate to increase Buyer's
                          Fixed Quantity under this Contract. However, Buyer
                          shall have a take-or-pay obligation in respect of LNG
                          quantities that have been the subject of a Round-Up
                          Request which is accepted by Seller; and

                 (iii)    if, at the end of any Fixed Quantity Period, Buyer
                          has purchased and received quantities of LNG
                          hereunder in excess of the Fixed Quantity of Buyer
                          for such Fixed Quantity Period other than Make-Up
                          LNG, Make-Good LNG, or Restoration Quantities, the
<PAGE>   28
                          excess shall be applied to reduce the Fixed Quantity
                          of the next Fixed Quantity Period.

         (b)     The obligation (set forth in paragraph (a) above) of Buyer to
                 pay for Fixed Quantities not taken in any Fixed Quantity
                 Period shall be reduced by the quantity of LNG which Buyer was
                 unable to purchase because of an event of Force Majeure
                 affecting either Seller or Buyer or because of Seller's
                 failure for any other reason to make such quantity available
                 for sale in accordance with this Contract.

         (c)     In calculating the quantity of LNG delivered by Seller and
                 purchased by Buyer for each Fixed Quantity Period, quantities
                 delivered and purchased within the first five (5) days of the
                 next Fixed Quantity Period shall be included, provided such
                 quantities were scheduled in the Annual Program for the Fixed
                 Quantity Period with respect to which the calculation is being
                 made.

         (d)     The obligation of Buyer pursuant to paragraph (a) above to pay
                 for quantities not taken may be reduced by the exercise of an
                 allowance as follows ("Allowance") :

                 (i)      Buyer may only exercise an Allowance by delivering
                          written notice to Seller, as described in Section
                          7.3(d)(ii).  A notice of exercise of an Allowance,
                          once given, may not be later withdrawn.  Provided,
                          however, that corrections of clerical or arithmetic
                          errors may be made at any time;

                 (ii)     each notice of exercise of an Allowance shall specify
                          the quantity of LNG subject to the Allowance. Such
                          notice shall be given pursuant to Section 12.1 or by
                          notice to Seller no later than sixty (60) days prior
                          to the scheduled date of loading of the Cargo to
                          which the Allowance specified in any such notice
                          relates;

                 (iii)    no Allowance can be exercised if its exercise would
                          result in Buyer's aggregate outstanding Allowances
                          exceeding six decimal four percent (6.4%) of the
                          Fixed Quantity for the Fixed Quantity Period in which
                          the Allowance is desired to be exercised. For the
                          purposes of this Section 7.3(d)(iii), and subject to
                          the provisions of Section 7.3(d)(viii), an Allowance,
                          or portion thereof, shall be deemed outstanding until
                          either Make-Good LNG is taken
<PAGE>   29
                          pursuant to Section 7.3(d)(iv), or payment is made
                          pursuant to Section 7.3(d)(vi);

                 (iv)     each Allowance shall be made good in full (even if it
                          amounts to a fractional portion of a Cargo) by the
                          purchase of an equal quantity of LNG in excess of
                          Fixed Quantities ("Make-Good LNG") within a period
                          commencing January 1 of the year following the Fixed
                          Quantity Period in relation to which such Allowance
                          was exercised and ending with the earlier of the
                          expiration of five (5) calendar years or March 31,
                          2018 ("Allowance Restoration Period"). Any Make-Good
                          LNG purchased after the expiration of the last Fixed
                          Quantity Period but prior to March 31, 2018 shall be
                          paid for at the LNG Element in effect as of the date
                          of delivery plus the actual transportation costs
                          incurred in delivering the Make-Good LNG. Buyer may
                          not satisfy a Make- Good Obligation or any part
                          thereof during a Fixed Quantity Period until it shall
                          first have taken its Fixed Quantity for such Fixed
                          Quantity Period. If Buyer has more than one Allowance
                          outstanding, the Make-Good Obligations in respect
                          thereof shall be satisfied in the same chronological
                          order in which such Allowances were exercised;

                 (v)      every request for Make-Good LNG, shall specify the
                          Allowance to which such request relates;

                 (vi)     if, at the expiration of the Allowance Restoration
                          Period, a Make-Good Obligation has not been satisfied
                          in full, Buyer pursuant to Section 7.3(d)(iv) shall
                          pay Seller for any unsatisfied portion of the
                          Make-Good Obligation at the Contract Sales Price
                          (reduced to exclude that portion of the
                          Transportation Element related to voyage costs) in
                          effect as of the last day of such Allowance
                          Restoration Period. Buyer shall have the right to
                          request Make-Up LNG pursuant to Section 7.5 with
                          respect to any such payment;

                 (vii)    Seller shall not be obligated to reserve any LNG
                          production or shipping capacity for the purposes of
                          permitting Buyer to satisfy Make-Good Obligations;
                          and

                 (viii)   in the event that Buyer requests quantities of LNG to
                          satisfy a Make-Good Obligation pursuant to Section
                          7.3(d)(v) which Seller
<PAGE>   30
                          is unable to make available for any reason, including
                          Force Majeure, the following provisions shall apply:

                          (A)     Buyer shall be relieved from the obligation
                                  pursuant to subparagraph (vi) to pay for such
                                  requested quantity as of the expiration of
                                  the Allowance Restoration Period relating
                                  thereto, except in the case where Section
                                  7.3(d)(viii)(C) requires such payment;

                          (B)     such requested quantities shall be deemed not
                                  outstanding for the purposes of Section
                                  7.3(d)(i) until Seller shall (whether during
                                  or after the Allowance Restoration Period)
                                  have offered the same to Buyer but shall then
                                  be outstanding if Buyer does not accept such
                                  offer; any change in the quantity outstanding
                                  due to a failure to accept such an offer
                                  shall not result in an acceleration of any
                                  then outstanding Make-Good Obligations; and

                          (C)     such requested quantities shall be scheduled
                                  for delivery at any time prior to the
                                  expiration of the last Fixed Quantity Period
                                  as mutually agreed by Seller and Buyer.  If
                                  such requested quantities have not been
                                  scheduled as of the end of the last Fixed
                                  Quantity Period and should Seller be unable
                                  to deliver such requested quantities during
                                  the three (3) months following the last Fixed
                                  Quantity Period, Buyer shall have no further
                                  obligation in respect thereof. If Seller
                                  gives Buyer reasonable notice that such
                                  requested quantities are available during
                                  such three-month period but Buyer does not
                                  take such quantities, Buyer shall then make
                                  the payment required under Section
                                  7.3(d)(vi).

7.4      Force Majeure Allocation

         (a)     Whenever deliveries of LNG by Seller under this Contract must
                 be reduced by reason of an event or circumstance of Force
                 Majeure affecting Seller's Facilities an allocation of
                 quantities then available for sale at the Seller's Facilities
                 will be made between Buyer and other purchasers of LNG from
                 Seller's Facilities.  At such times, the total quantities
                 available for sale from Seller's Facilities shall be allocated
                 among the purchasers therefrom (including Buyer) pro rata in
                 the ratio of their respective quantities which are eligible
                 for allocation as provided
<PAGE>   31
                 below. The quantities eligible for such allocation shall, as
                 to Buyer, be the portion of the Fixed Quantities to be
                 purchased hereunder during the period of such Force Majeure
                 and, as to other purchasers, be those fixed or contract
                 quantities of LNG which are committed for sale from Seller's
                 Facilities during the period of such Force Majeure in
                 satisfaction of Seller's contracts with other purchasers which
                 provide for sales of LNG over a term of at least fifteen (15)
                 years.

         (b)     If such an event of Force Majeure does not preclude full
                 production and loading of all Fixed Quantities under the
                 allocation formula described in paragraph (a) above, but is of
                 such an extent as to prevent Seller from producing and loading
                 all Make-Up LNG, Make-Good LNG and Restoration Quantities
                 scheduled for delivery from Seller's Facilities to Buyer and
                 equivalent quantities for the same purposes scheduled for
                 delivery from Seller's Facilities to other purchasers under
                 LNG sales contracts providing for deliveries over a term of at
                 least fifteen (15) years, quantities of such LNG as are
                 available shall be allocated between Buyer and such other
                 purchasers in proportion to the respective quantities so
                 scheduled.

         (c)     Whenever deliveries of LNG by Buyer under this Contract must
                 be reduced by reason of a Buyer Force Majeure, an allocation
                 of quantities then able to be received at Buyer's Facilities
                 will be made between Seller and other suppliers of LNG to
                 Buyer.  At such times, the total quantities able to be
                 received by Buyer's Facilities shall be allocated among the
                 suppliers therefrom (including Seller) pro rata in the ratio
                 of their respective quantities which are eligible for
                 allocation as provided below.  The quantities eligible for
                 such allocation shall, as to Seller, be the portion of the
                 Fixed Quantities to be sold hereunder during the period of
                 such Force Majeure and, as to other suppliers, be those fixed
                 or contract quantities of LNG which are committed for sale to
                 Buyer during the period of such Force Majeure in satisfaction
                 of Buyer's contracts with other suppliers which provide for
                 sales of LNG to Buyer over a term of at least fifteen (15)
                 years.

7.5      Take-or-Pay Make-Up

         If, pursuant to Section 7.3(a) or Section 7.3(d)(vi), Buyer shall have
         paid for any quantity of LNG which was not taken by Buyer
         ("Take-or-Pay Quantity"), then, in any subsequent year, Buyer may
         purchase up to an equal quantity of LNG from Seller as make-up LNG
         ("Make-Up LNG") (to the extent not
<PAGE>   32
         previously made up). Buyer may request Make-Up LNG by giving written
         notice to Seller as provided in Section 12.1.  If, during any year for
         which Make-Up LNG has been requested, (i) Seller has uncommitted
         quantities of LNG available for such purpose, (ii) Seller has
         available LNG Tanker capacity which may be used to transport such
         Make-Up LNG, and (iii) Buyer shall have first taken and paid for the
         Fixed Quantity for such year, then Seller shall sell and deliver to
         Buyer the quantity of Make-Up LNG requested; provided, however, that
         after the expiration of three (3) months following the end of the last
         Fixed Quantity Period such Make-Up LNG shall only be made available if
         either Seller has at the time uncommitted shipping capacity available
         for the purpose or Buyer provides transportation. Buyer's right to
         purchase Make-Up LNG under this Section 7.5 shall expire on December
         31, 2018 unless Buyer shall have requested Make-Up LNG during the year
         2017 or by January 15, 2018 pursuant to Section 12.2 and Seller shall
         have had insufficient uncommitted LNG to meet such request. In such
         circumstances, the parties shall consult to agree upon a deferred
         schedule for Buyer to take delivery of any outstanding balance of
         Take-or-Pay Quantity not made up by December 31, 2018. Buyer shall pay
         for Make-Up LNG at the Contract Sales Price in effect as of the date
         of delivery, reduced by the amount previously paid on account of all
         or that part of the Take-or-Pay Quantity being made up by such sale;
         provided, however, that any Make-Up LNG delivered after the end of the
         last Fixed Quantity Period shall be paid for at the LNG Element in
         effect as of the date of delivery (reduced by the amount previously
         paid as the LNG Element on account of all or that part of the
         Take-or-Pay Quantity being made up by such sale) plus the actual
         transportation costs incurred in delivering the Make-Up LNG.
         Take-or-Pay Quantities shall be made up, and prior payments applicable
         thereto applied, in the same chronological order in which such
         quantities accrued.

7.6      Force Majeure Deficiency

         (a)     If, during any Fixed Quantity Period or Fixed Quantity
                 Periods, all or any portion of the Fixed Quantity of LNG
                 required to be taken by Buyer therein is not delivered by
                 Seller or taken by Buyer by reason of Force Majeure (any such
                 quantity not taken for such reason being called a "Force
                 Majeure Deficiency"), the Parties shall each make best efforts
                 to restore the Force Majeure Deficiency in full by Seller
                 selling and Buyer purchasing such quantities of LNG prior to
                 the expiration of the last Fixed Quantity Period. In the event
                 that, despite such best efforts, Seller fails to deliver or
                 Buyer fails to take delivery of the outstanding Restoration
                 Quantities by the end of 2017, then any obligation of Seller
<PAGE>   33
                 to deliver and Buyer to take delivery of such Restoration
                 Quantities shall cease on such date. The quantities to be
                 restored ("Restoration Quantities") will be scheduled for
                 delivery pursuant to Article 12 at the mutual convenience of
                 the Parties. As between a Force Majeure Deficiency resulting
                 from Force Majeure affecting Seller and a Force Majeure
                 Deficiency resulting from a Buyer Force Majeure, the
                 Restoration Quantities applicable thereto shall be scheduled
                 in the chronological order in which the Force Majeure events
                 arose. Buyer shall pay for Restoration Quantities at the
                 Contract Sales Price in effect as of the date of delivery. In
                 the case of Restoration Quantities arising from a Buyer Force
                 Majeure, that part of the invoice relating to the
                 Transportation Element for  the quantities being restored will
                 be reduced by the amount of any Non-Utilization Cost
                 previously paid under Section 4.7 in respect of such
                 quantities.

         (b)     If a Buyer Force Majeure causes a reduction in deliveries of
                 LNG and if Seller sells to third parties quantities of LNG
                 which Buyer is unable to purchase, then the Force Majeure
                 Deficiency shall be reduced by the amount, if any, that
                 Seller's Gas Supply Obligation (including amounts so sold to
                 third parties) exceeds the estimate of Proved Remaining
                 Recoverable Reserves stated in the most recent Certificate as
                 a result of such sales.

7.7      Allocation for Make-Good LNG, Make-Up LNG and Restoration Quantities

         Whenever Make-Good LNG is requested under Section 7.3(d), Make-Up LNG
         is requested under Section 7.5 and/or Restoration Quantities are
         requested under Section 7.6(a) by Buyer and quantities are requested
         for similar purposes by other purchasers from Seller's Facilities
         under contracts which provide for sales of LNG over a term of at least
         fifteen (15) years, and uncommitted quantities of LNG are not
         available from Seller's Facilities to meet all such requests, then the
         quantities of LNG which are available from Seller's Facilities for
         such purposes shall be allocated, as between Buyer on the one hand and
         such other purchasers on the other hand, based on the proportion of
         the contract quantities of each requesting purchaser to the total of
         the contract quantities of all of the requesting purchasers.
<PAGE>   34
7.8      Order of Priority of Make-Good LNG, Make-Up LNG and Restoration
         Quantities

         Make-Good LNG requested under Section 7.3(d) and Make-Up LNG requested
         under Section 7.5 and Restoration Quantities under Section 7.6(a)
         shall be delivered and taken in the following order:

                 (i)      Make-Up LNG;
                 (ii)     Make-Good LNG; and
                 (iii)    Restoration Quantities.

         Provided, however, that Buyer and Seller may agree from time to time
         to alter the order of the foregoing for a specific purpose and period
         of time, and after each such period the above order of priority shall
         be restored.

                        ARTICLE 8 - CONTRACT SALES PRICE

8.1      Formula Calculation of Price

         The contract sales price applicable to the quantities of LNG to be
         sold and delivered at the Delivery Point and to any quantities of LNG
         required to be taken but which are not taken and are required to be
         paid for by Buyer hereunder, expressed in United States Dollars per
         million British Thermal Units (U.S.$/MMBTU) ("Contract Sales Price"),
         shall comprise an LNG element ("LNG Element") and a transportation
         element ("Transportation Element") and shall be determined and
         adjusted from time to time in accordance with the provisions of this
         Article 8. The Contract Sales Price to be applied to the BTUs
         comprising each Cargo shall be that Contract Sales Price in effect as
         of the date of completion of unloading of such Cargo.

8.2      LNG Element

         (a)     The LNG Element included in the Contract Sales Price shall be
                 calculated according to the following formula:

               9             A         1         U.S.CPIn
         LE = --- (Po x ----------) + --- (Po' x --------) + C
              10        U.S.$18.00    10         U.S.CPIo

where:

         LE      =        the LNG Element (expressed in U.S.$/MMBTU);

         Po      =        U.S.$3.06/MMBTU;

         A       =        the arithmetic average of the realized export prices
                          per barrel in U.S. Dollars, f.o.b.  Indonesia, of all
                          field classifications of Indonesian crude oils then
                          being sold and exported by PERTAMINA, except premiums
                          and except such prices for spot sales;

         Po'     =        U.S.$ 3.24/MMBTU;

   U.S.CPIn      =        in respect of the applicable calendar year, the
                          average of the monthly values of U.S.CPI for the
                          twelve-month period commencing with the month of
                          November, fourteen (14) months prior to the beginning
                          of the applicable calendar year, and ending
<PAGE>   36
                          with the month of October, three (3) months prior to
                          the commencement of the applicable calendar year;

  U.S.CPIo       =        143.8, being the arithmetic average of the monthly
                          values of U.S.CPI for the twelve-month period,
                          November 1992 through October 1993; and

         C       =        U.S.$0.012/MMBTU.

    (b)  An adjustment of the LNG Element to reflect any change in U.S.CPI
         shall be made on and shall be effective as of January 1 of each
         calendar year, and further adjustments of the LNG Element shall be
         made as of each effective date on which:

         (i)     the realized export prices of more than one of the field
                 classifications of Indonesian crude oils sold by PERTAMINA
                 shall have changed from the respective prices therefor
                 included in the last preceding determination of "A" made
                 pursuant to Section 8.2(a); or

         (ii)    two or more field classifications of such crude oils shall
                 have been added to or deleted from the crude oils being sold
                 by PERTAMINA since the date of the last preceding
                 determination of "A" made pursuant to Section 8.2(a).

         Procedures for verifying changes in the realized export prices of all
         Indonesian crude oils and for determining the effective date of any
         adjustment of the LNG Element shall be separately agreed upon by the
         Parties.

    (c)  The Parties shall agree separate procedures for handling corrections,
         revisions or changes in the calculation of  U.S.CPI. It is agreed that
         if at any time the U.S. Department of Labor, Bureau of Labor
         Statistics discontinues publishing a report on U.S.CPI values, then
         the Parties shall agree upon an index method that reflects inflation
         in the United States of America's consumer prices to replace the
         discontinued U.S.CPI report.

8.3      Transportation Element for Fixed Quantity Periods beginning in 2000

         The Transportation Element to be included in the Contract Sales Price
         shall be determined on, and with effect from, January 1, of each
         calendar year, in accordance with the following formula (expressed in
         U.S.$/MMBTU):

                          TE   =   0.58  x  (1.025)n

         where:  n        =       1 on January 1, 1995 and one higher whole
                                  number on each subsequent January 1.

                 TE       =       the Transportation Element expressed in
                                  U.S.$/MMBTU for the Fixed Quantity Periods
                                  beginning in 2000.

8.4      Transportation Element for 1998 and 1999 Fixed Quantity Periods

         Without prejudice to any other provisions of this Contract, the
         provisions of Section 8.3 shall not apply to determine the
         Transportation Element to be included in the Contract Sales Price for
         1998 and 1999 Fixed Quantities. The Transportation Element to be
         included in the Contract Sales Price for 1998 and 1999 Fixed
         Quantities shall be determined on, and with effect from, January 1 of
         each such year, in accordance with the following formula (expressed in
         U.S.$/MMBTU):

                          TE   =   0.58  x  (1.025)n

         where:  n        =       1 on January 1, 1995 and one higher whole
                                  number on each subsequent January 1.

                 TE       =       the Transportation Element expressed in
                                  U.S.$/MMBTU for the Fixed Quantity Periods
                                  1998 and 1999.

                       ARTICLE 10 - INVOICES AND PAYMENT

10.1     Invoice and Cargo Documents

         (a)     Promptly after completion of unloading of an LNG Tanker,
                 Seller, or its representative, shall furnish to Buyer, or its
                 representative, a certificate of volume unloaded together with
                 such other documents concerning the cargo as may be reasonably
                 requested by Buyer for the purpose of Taiwan customs
                 clearance. Buyer shall complete a laboratory analysis pursuant
                 to Section 13.7 to determine quality and BTU content of the
                 LNG as soon as possible but not later than forty-eight (48)
                 hours after the completion of unloading and shall promptly
                 furnish to Seller or its representative a certificate with
                 respect thereto by telex, telegram or facsimile or by other
                 agreed means of electronic communication.

         (b)     (i)      Promptly upon completion of such analysis, Seller or
                          its representative shall furnish by telex, telegram,
                          or facsimile or by other agreed means of electronic
                          communication to Buyer an invoice, stated in U.S.
                          Dollars, in the amount of the Contract Sales Price
                          for the number of BTUs delivered; and

                 (ii)     At the same time Seller shall send to Buyer a hard
                          copy of the invoice together with relevant documents
                          setting forth the basis for the calculation thereof.

         (c)     If Buyer has not completed the above mentioned quality and BTU
                 analysis within the forty-eight (48) hour period mentioned
                 above, Seller may furnish a provisional commercial invoice
                 based upon the typical BTU content and typical mole
                 composition analysis of LNG then being delivered to Buyer, and
                 such provisional invoice shall be payable on the due date
                 specified in Section 10.3 subject only to any later adjusting
                 payment which may be called for when the aforesaid analysis
                 has been completed.

10.2     Other Invoices

         Any amount (other than an amount provided for in Section 10.1) due
         from one Party to the other, including, without limitation, amounts
         payable pursuant to Section 7.3(a) (on account of Fixed Quantities of
         LNG required to be purchased but which were not taken by Buyer) and
         Section 7.3(d)(vi), then the Party to whom such moneys are owed shall
         furnish an invoice therefor together with
<PAGE>   40
         relevant supporting documents showing the basis for the calculation
         thereof. The procedure set forth in Section 10.1(b) for sending an
         invoice by telex, telegram, or facsimile or by other agreed means of
         electronic communication shall be followed. Such invoices shall be
         paid in accordance with Section 10.3(b).

10.3     Invoice Due Dates, etc.

         (a)     Each invoice for LNG delivered to Buyer referred to in Section
                 10.1 shall become due and payable by Buyer on the eighth (8th)
                 Business Day in Taiwan after the date on which the invoice has
                 been received by Buyer in Taiwan under Section 10.1(b)(i).

         (b)     Each invoice sent pursuant to Section 10.2 shall become due
                 and payable by the Party receiving the invoice within twenty
                 (20) calendar days after the date of  receipt of such invoice.

         (c)     Invoices sent by telex shall be deemed received upon receipt
                 of the addressee's answerback to conclude transmission and in
                 the case of facsimile, when the addressee acknowledges receipt
                 of a legible invoice. The Parties shall send invoices
                 hereunder by telex whenever possible.

         (d)     If any invoice to Buyer has a due date that is not a Business
                 Day in Taiwan, such invoice shall become due and payable on
                 the next day which is a Business Day in Taiwan.

         (e)     If any invoice to Seller has a due date that is not a Business
                 Day in Indonesia, such invoice shall become due and payable on
                 the next day which is a Business Day in Indonesia.

         (f)     In the event the full amount of any invoice is not paid when
                 due, any unpaid amount thereof shall bear interest from the
                 due date until paid, at an interest rate, compounded annually,
                 two percent (2%) greater than the Prime Rate in effect from
                 time to time during the period of delinquency. Such interest
                 rate shall be adjusted up or down, as the case may be, to
                 reflect any changes in the Prime Rate as of the dates of such
                 changes in the Prime Rate.

10.4     Payment

         (a)     Buyer shall pay, or cause to be paid, in U.S. Dollars all
                 amounts which become due and payable by Buyer pursuant to any
                 invoice issued hereunder to a bank account or accounts in the
                 United States to be designated by Seller.  Buyer shall not be
                 responsible for such bank's disbursement of amounts remitted
                 by Buyer to such bank, and Buyer's deposit in immediately
                 available funds of the full amount of each invoice with such
                 bank shall constitute full discharge and satisfaction of the
                 obligations hereunder for which such amounts were remitted.
                 Each payment by Buyer of any amount owing hereunder shall be
                 in the full amount due without reduction or offset for any
                 reason, including, without limitation, taxes in Taiwan,
                 exchange charges or bank transfer charges.

         (b)     Transfer of funds to the bank in the United States, effected
                 from Taiwan before the close of business in Taiwan on or
                 before the due date of any invoice, shall be deemed timely
                 payment notwithstanding that such United States bank cannot
                 credit such transfer as ready funds for a period of up to
                 thirteen (13) hours by reason of the time difference between
                 Taiwan and the United States or for one or more days which are
                 not banking days in the United States.

         (c)     Seller shall pay, or cause to be paid, in U.S. Dollars the
                 amounts which become due and payable by Seller pursuant to a
                 Section 10.2 invoice to an account with a bank designated by
                 Buyer. Seller shall not be responsible for the designated
                 bank's disbursement of funds by Seller to Buyer pursuant to
                 this paragraph (c).

10.5     Seller's Rights Upon Buyer's Failure to Make Payment

         If payment of any invoice for quantities of LNG delivered hereunder or
         for Fixed Quantities of LNG not taken and for which Buyer is obligated
         to pay hereunder is not made within thirty (30) days after the due
         date thereof, Seller shall be entitled, upon giving thirty (30) days'
         written notice to Buyer, to suspend subsequent deliveries to Buyer
         until the amount of such invoice and interest thereon has been paid,
         and Buyer shall not be entitled to any make-up rights in respect of
         such suspended deliveries. Any such suspension shall be without
         prejudice to any other rights and remedies of Seller arising hereunder
         or by law or otherwise, including the right of Seller to receive
         payment of all
<PAGE>   42
         obligations and claims which arose or accrued prior to such suspension
         or by reason of such default by Buyer.

10.6     Disputed Invoices

         In the event of disagreement concerning any invoice, Buyer shall make
         provisional payment of the total amount thereof and shall immediately
         notify Seller of the reasons for such disagreement, except that:

         (i)     in the case of obvious error in computation, Buyer shall pay
                 the correct amount disregarding such error; and

         (ii)    in the case of any disputed invoice for demurrage incurred at
                 the Unloading Port, Buyer's provisional payment shall be
                 ninety percent (90%) thereof or such greater amount as is not
                 disputed by Buyer.

         Invoices may be contested by Buyer or modified by Seller only if,
         within a period of ninety (90) days after Buyer's receipt thereof,
         Buyer serves on Seller notice questioning their correctness.  If no
         such notice is served, invoices shall be deemed correct and accepted
         by both parties.  Promptly after resolution of any dispute as to an
         invoice, the amount of any overpayment or underpayment shall be paid
         by Seller or Buyer  to the other, as the case may be, together with a
         late fee on such overpayment or underpayment at the same rate as
         provided for in Section 10.3(d) for the period from the due date for
         payment of the contested invoice until the date such overpayment or
         underpayment is made.

                              ARTICLE 11 - QUALITY

11.1     Gross Heating Value

         The LNG when delivered by Seller to Buyer shall have, in a gaseous
         state, a Gross Heating Value of not less than 1100 BTUs per Standard
         Cubic Foot and not more than 1160 BTUs per Standard Cubic Foot
         determined in accordance with the quality standards and procedures as
         provided in Schedule A.

11.2     Components

         The LNG delivered by Seller to Buyer shall, in a gaseous state,
         contain not less than eighty-five molecular percentage (85 MOL%) of
         methane (CH4), and, for the components and substances listed below,
         such LNG shall not contain more than the following:

         A.      Nitrogen (N2), 1.0 MOL %.
         B.      Butanes (C4) and heavier, 2.00 MOL %.
         C.      Pentanes (C5) and heavier, 0.10 MOL %.
         D.      Hydrogen sulfide (H2S), 0.25 grains per 100 Standard Cubic
                 Feet (0.25 grains/100 scf).
         E.      Total sulfur content, 1.3 grains per 100 Standard Cubic Feet
                 (1.3 grains/100 scf).
 
         Although the LNG which Seller delivers to Buyer is permitted to
         contain the sulfur concentrations shown in clauses D and E above,
         under normal operating conditions at Seller's Facilities, Seller would
         expect such concentrations to be materially less. Should any question
         regarding quality of the LNG arise, Seller and Buyer shall consult and
         cooperate concerning such question.

                ARTICLE 12 - PROGRAMMING AND SHIPPING MOVEMENTS

12.1     Annual Program

         (a)     On or before June 15 preceding each Fixed Quantity Period
                 Seller shall notify Buyer of the current estimate of the BTU
                 content of each Cargo to be delivered in such Fixed Quantity
                 Period based to the extent practicable on recent operating
                 experience. Not later than ninety (90) days prior to the
                 beginning of each calendar year, Seller shall give written
                 notice to Buyer of the anticipated quantities of LNG to be
                 available for delivery hereunder from Seller's Facilities in
                 each calendar quarter of the next calendar year, taking into
                 consideration the projected capacity of Seller's Facilities.
                 On or before October 15 of each year in which such notice is
                 given, Buyer shall advise Seller in writing of the quantities
                 Buyer wishes to take during each calendar quarter of the
                 following year, specifying the amount of any Make-Up LNG
                 requested pursuant to Section 7.5, and any Restoration
                 Quantities in excess of Fixed Quantities requested pursuant to
                 Section 7.6(a), and, if known by Buyer, any Allowance it
                 intends to exercise. In addition, by October 15 of each year,
                 Buyer shall request any Make-Good LNG pursuant to Section
                 7.3(d)(iv). The Parties shall thereupon consult together
                 regarding a programming schedule of quantities to be delivered
                 to Buyer's Facilities during each calendar month during the
                 following year. Thereafter, Seller shall issue by December 1
                 of the same year a programming schedule ("Annual Program"),
                 which shall take into consideration the anticipated capacity
                 of the Parties' respective facilities, the Coordinated
                 Maintenance Schedule and the shipping schedules.  Such Annual
                 Program and the Ninety-Day Schedules referred to below (and
                 any revisions thereof) are intended to assist the Parties in
                 planning their respective operations during the periods
                 involved.  The content of the Annual Program and Ninety-Day
                 Schedules shall not reduce the entitlement of any Party during
                 any Fixed Quantity Period to sell, deliver and be paid for, or
                 to purchase and receive, as the case may be, the quantities of
                 LNG required under Article 7 to be sold, delivered and paid
                 for during such Fixed Quantity Period. The Parties will each
                 take all appropriate steps to carry out each Annual Program
                 and Ninety-Day Schedule.
<PAGE>   45
         (b)     An Annual Program shall be amended to reflect a request for:

                 (i)      Make-Up LNG relating to a Take-or-Pay Quantity paid
                          for in respect of the immediately preceding year;

                 (ii)     Make-Good LNG relating to an Allowance exercised in
                          respect of the immediately preceding year; or

                 (iii)    Restoration Quantities relating to a Force Majeure
                          Deficiency arising in respect of the immediately
                          preceding year;

                 provided that the requested LNG and the necessary
                 transportation are available and such request is received by
                 Seller not later than January 15 of the year to which such
                 Annual Program relates.

12.2     Ninety-Day Schedules

         Not later than the fifteenth (15th) day of each calendar month, Seller
         shall, after discussion with Buyer, deliver to Buyer a three-month
         forward plan of delivery ("Ninety-Day Schedule"), which follows the
         applicable Annual Program as nearly as practicable and sets forth, by
         voyages and the projected dates thereof, the pattern of shipments
         forecast for each of the next three (3) calendar months.  Each
         Ninety-Day Schedule shall reflect all adjustments, if any,
         necessitated by deviation from prior Ninety-Day Schedules so as to
         maintain as far as practicable the scheduled shipments forecast in the
         Annual Program.

12.3     Maintenance and Inspection Coordination

         Not later than ninety (90) days prior to the beginning of each
         calendar year, the Parties shall consult and agree on a program
         designed to coordinate the anticipated scheduled maintenance and
         inspection downtime during that calendar year of Buyer's Facilities,
         Seller's Facilities, and the LNG Tankers. Such program ("Coordinated
         Maintenance Schedule") will be devised so as to minimize the
         collective impact of such downtime and maintenance periods on the
         continuous delivery of LNG hereunder.

                      ARTICLE 13 - MEASUREMENTS AND TESTS

13.1     Parties to Supply Devices

         Seller shall supply, operate and maintain, or cause to be supplied,
         operated and maintained,  suitable gauging devices for the LNG tanks
         of the LNG Tanker, pressure and temperature measuring devices, and any
         other measurement or testing devices which are incorporated in the
         structure of LNG tankers or customarily maintained on shipboard.

         Buyer shall supply, operate and maintain, or cause to be supplied,
         operated and maintained, devices required for collecting samples and
         for determining quality and composition of the LNG and any other
         measurement or testing devices which are incorporated in land
         structures or customarily maintained at LNG unloading facilities.

13.2     Selection of Devices

         Such devices shall be chosen by mutual agreement of the Parties and
         shall be such as are, at the time of selection, the most accurate and
         reliable devices in their practical application.  The required degree
         of accuracy of such devices selected shall be mutually agreed upon and
         verified by the Parties, in advance of their use, and at the request
         of either Buyer or Seller such degree of accuracy shall be verified by
         an independent surveyor mutually agreed upon by the Parties. In any
         event all measuring devices (including those on board an LNG Tanker)
         shall comply with the maximum permissible tolerances provided for in
         Schedule A Part III.

13.3     Units of Measurement and Calibration

         The Parties will cooperate closely in the design, selection, and
         acquisition of devices to be used for measurements and tests under
         this Article 13 in order that, to the maximum extent possible, all
         measurements and tests may be conducted either in Imperial units of
         measurement or in S.I. units of measurement.  In the event that it
         becomes necessary to make measurements and tests using a new system of
         units of measurement, the Parties shall establish mutually agreeable
         conversion tables, or, if they are unable to agree, such tables may be
         established by the procedures provided for resolution of disputes on
         measurement and testing in Section 13.11.  Measurement devices shall
         be calibrated as follows :

13.4     Tank Gauge Tables of LNG Tankers

         Seller shall provide Buyer, or cause Buyer to be provided, with a
         certified copy of tank gauge tables for each LNG tank of each LNG
         Tanker verified by a competent impartial authority or authorities
         mutually agreed upon by the Parties.  Such tables shall include
         correction tables for list, trim, tank construction and any other
         items requiring such tables for accuracy of gauging. The Parties shall
         each have the right to have representatives present at the time each
         LNG tank on each LNG Tanker is volumetrically calibrated.  If the LNG
         tanks of any LNG Tanker suffer distortion of such nature so as to
         cause a prudent expert to question reasonably the validity of the tank
         gauge tables described herein (or any subsequent calibration provided
         for herein),  Seller shall cause Seller's Transporter to notify Buyer
         and Buyer or Seller may require recalibration of such LNG tanks during
         any period when the LNG Tanker is out of service for scheduled
         inspection or repairs. Upon recalibration of the LNG tanks of the LNG
         Tankers, the same procedures used to provide the original tank gauge
         tables will be used to provide revised tank gauge tables based upon
         the recalibration data.  The calibration and recalibration of LNG
         tanks provided for in this Section 13.4 shall constitute the only
         calibration required for purposes of this Contract.

13.5     Gauging and Measuring LNG Volumes Delivered

         Volumes of LNG delivered pursuant to this Contract shall be determined
         by gauging the LNG in the LNG tanks of the LNG Tankers before and
         after unloading.

         Gauging the liquid in the LNG tanks of the LNG Tankers and measuring
         of liquid temperature, vapor temperature and vapor absolute pressure
         in each LNG tank, trim and list of the LNG Tankers, and atmospheric
         pressure shall be performed, or be caused to be performed, by Seller
         before and after unloading.
<PAGE>   48
The first gauging and measurements shall be made immediately before the
commencement of unloading. The second gauging and measurements shall take place
immediately after completion of unloading.

Copies of gauging and measurement records shall be furnished to Buyer.

    A.   Gauging the Liquid Level of LNG
         The level of the LNG in each LNG tank of the LNG Tanker shall be
         gauged by means of the gauging device installed in the LNG Tanker for
         that purpose.  The level of the LNG in each LNG tank of the LNG Tanker
         shall be logged and printed on board the LNG Tanker.

    B.   Determination of Temperature
         The temperature of the LNG and of the vapor space in each LNG tank of
         the LNG Tanker shall be measured by Seller by means of a sufficient
         number of properly located temperature measuring devices, to permit
         the determination of average temperatures.  Temperatures shall be
         logged and printed on board the LNG Tanker.

    C.   Determination of Pressure
         The absolute pressure of the vapor in each LNG tank shall be
         determined by means of pressure measuring devices installed in each
         LNG tank of the LNG Tanker. The atmospheric pressure shall be
         determined and recorded by readings from the standard barometer
         installed in the LNG Tanker.

    D.   Determination of Density
         Density of the LNG shall be determined by Seller  as mutually agreed
         to by the Parties. Initially, the density of the LNG will be computed
         by the method described in Schedule A.. Should any improved data, or
         method of calculation become available which is acceptable to the
         Parties, such improved data, or method shall then be used.

13.6     Samples for Quality Analysis

         Representative samples of the LNG delivered shall be obtained, or be
         caused to be obtained, in triplicate by Buyer during the time of
         unloading and delivery to Buyer.  The three (3) samples shall be taken
         from an appropriate point on Buyer's receiving line as close as
         possible to the unloading flanges and collected in the gaseous state
         using the continuous gasification/collection
<PAGE>   49
         method agreed by the Parties. In addition Buyer shall obtain spot
         samples during unloading. The method and devices for sampling and the
         quantity of the samples to be withdrawn, shall be determined by
         agreement between the Parties to provide for taking representative and
         adequate samples of the LNG delivered.

         The samples obtained shall be distributed as follows:

         First sample     -       for use for analysis by Buyer receiving the
                                  LNG shipment.

         Second sample    -       for use of Seller.

         Third sample     -       for retention by Buyer for an agreed period,
                                  not to exceed twenty (20) days, during which
                                  any dispute as to the accuracy of any
                                  analysis shall be raised, in which case the
                                  sample shall be further retained until the
                                  Parties agree to retain it no longer.

         If it is not possible for any reason to obtain composite samples by
         the continuous gasification/collection method, the composition of the
         LNG delivered shall be the arithmetic average of the results obtained
         by analyses of the spot samples. If it is not possible to obtain such
         spot samples, an analysis of the LNG loaded at the Loading Port, after
         adjustment for boil-off measured in respect of the laden voyage, shall
         be used to determine the composition of the cargo delivered. For this
         purpose, Seller shall utilize devices comparable to those utilized at
         Buyer's Facilities and shall employ methods of taking and analyzing
         the samples at the Loading Port comparable in accuracy to those
         employed at Buyer's Facilities.

13.7     Quality Analysis

         The samples provided for in Section 13.6 shall be analyzed, or be
         caused to be analyzed, by Buyer on receiving the LNG shipment to
         determine the molar fraction of the hydrocarbon and other components
         in the sample by gas chromatography in accordance with "G.P.A.
         Standard 2261, method of Analysis for Natural Gas and Similar Gaseous
         Mixtures by Gas Chromatography", published by G.P.A., current as of
         1990.  If better standards for analysis are subsequently adopted by
         G.P.A. or other recognized competent impartial authority, upon mutual
         agreement of the Parties, they shall be substituted for
<PAGE>   50
         the standards then in use, but such substitution shall not take place
         retroactively.

         The spot samples taken as specified in Section 13.6 shall serve the
         purpose of fall-back reference in case of failure to obtain a
         representative composite sample.  The composition of the LNG unloaded
         from the LNG Tanker shall be determined in case of such failure in
         accordance with the procedure provided for in Section 13.6.

         A calibration of the chromatograph or other analytical instrument used
         shall be performed by Buyer immediately prior to the analysis of the
         sample of LNG delivered.

         Buyer shall give advance notice to Seller of the time Buyer intends to
         conduct a calibration thereof, and Seller shall have the right to have
         a representative present at each such calibration; provided, however,
         Buyer shall not be obliged to defer or reschedule any calibration in
         order to permit the representative of Seller to be present.

         The sample shall be analyzed, or be caused to be analyzed, by Buyer to
         determine the concentrations of hydrogen sulfide (H2S) and total
         sulfur referred to in Section 11.2 using the methods described as
         follows:

         -       ASTM D 2784-70 Standard Method of Test for Sulfur in Liquefied
                 Petroleum Cases

                 If the total sulfur content is less than zero decimal
                 twenty-five (0.25 ) grains per 100 Standard Cubic Feet, it
                 shall not be necessary to analyze the sample for hydrogen
                 sulfide.

         -       ASTM D 2725-70 Standard Method of Test for Hydrogen Sulfide in
                 Natural Gas (Methylene Blue Method).

13.8     Operating Procedures

         Prior to conducting operations for measurement, gauging and analysis
         provided in Sections 13.5, 13.6 and 13.7 the Party responsible for
         such operations shall notify the appropriate representatives of the
         other Party, allowing such representative reasonable opportunity to be
         present for all operations and computations; however, the absence of
         the other Party's representative after notification and opportunity to
         attend shall not prevent any operations and
<PAGE>   51
         computations from being performed.  At the request of either Party,
         any measurement, gauging and analysis provided for in Sections 13.5,
         13.6 and 13.7 shall be witnessed and verified by an independent
         surveyor mutually agreed upon by the Parties. The results of such
         surveyor's verifications shall be made available promptly to each
         party.  All records of measurements and the computation results shall
         be preserved and available to the Parties for a period of not less
         than three (3) years after such measurements and computation.  A
         procedure for operation of onboard CTMS equipment shall be developed
         and mutually agreed during the design phase of the Dedicated LNG
         Tanker.

13.9     BTU Quantities Delivered

         The quantity of BTUs of LNG delivered from an LNG Tanker shall be
         calculated by Seller following the procedures described in this
         Section 13.9 and shall be verified by an independent surveyor mutually
         agreed upon by the Parties.

         A.      Determination of Gross Heating Value
                 The Gross Heating Value of the samples of the LNG shall be
                 determined by computation, in accordance with the method
                 described in Schedule A, on the basis of the molecular
                 composition determined pursuant to Section 13.7 and of the
                 molecular weights and heating values described in "G.P.A.
                 Publication 2145" published by G.P.A., current at the time of
                 computation.

                 If better constants or improved methods for determination of
                 heating value are subsequently adopted by G.P.A. or other
                 recognized competent impartial authority, they shall, upon
                 mutual agreement of the Parties, be substituted therefor, but
                 not retroactively.  The Gross Heating Value of the
                 representative sample shall be the conclusive Gross Heating
                 Value for the purpose of determining quantities of BTUs
                 delivered.

         B.      Determination of Volume of LNG Unloaded
                 The LNG volume in the LNG tanks of the LNG Tanker before and
                 after unloading shall be determined by gauging as provided in
                 Section 13.5 on the basis of the tank gauge tables provided
                 for in Section 13.4.  The volume of LNG remaining in the LNG
                 tanks of the LNG Tanker after unloading shall then be
                 subtracted from the volume before unloading and the resulting
                 volume shall be taken as the volume of the LNG delivered from
                 the LNG Tanker.
<PAGE>   52
                 If failure of gauging and measuring devices of an LNG Tanker
                 taking the CTMS operating procedure into consideration should
                 cause impossibility of determining the LNG volume, the volume
                 of LNG delivered shall be determined by gauging the liquid
                 level in Buyer's onshore LNG storage tanks immediately before
                 and after unloading the LNG Tanker and such volume shall be
                 increased by adding an estimated LNG volume, agreed upon by
                 the Parties, for boil-off from such onshore LNG storage tanks
                 and related pipelines during the unloading of LNG. Buyer shall
                 provide Seller, or cause Seller to be provided with, a
                 certified copy of tank gauge tables for each onshore LNG tank
                 which is to be used for this purpose verified by a competent
                 impartial authority.

    C.   Determination of BTU Quantities Delivered
         The quantities of BTUs delivered from LNG Tankers shall be computed by
         Seller  by means of the following formula:

         Q       =        V  x  D  x  P  - Qr

         where:
         Q       represents the quantity of the LNG delivered in BTUs.

         V       represents the volume of the LNG unloaded, stated in Cubic
                 Meters, determined as provided in Section 13.9 B.

         D       represents the density of the LNG unloaded, stated in
                 kilograms per Cubic Meter, as determined in accordance with
                 Schedule A.

         P       represents the Gross Heating Value of the LNG unloaded, stated
                 in BTUs per kilogram as determined in accordance with Schedule
                 A.

         Qr      represents the quantity in BTUs of the vapor which displaced
                 the volume of LNG unloaded from the LNG tanks of the LNG
                 Tanker.

Physical constants, calculation procedures and examples of BTU determination
are provided in Schedule A.

13.10    Verification of Accuracy and Correction for Error

         Accuracy of devices used shall be tested and verified in accordance
         with a program as recommended by the manufacturer unless superseded by
         a mutually agreed schedule at any time, if requested by either Party,
         including the request by a Party to verify accuracy of its own
         devices.  Each Party shall have the right to inspect at any time the
         measurement devices installed by the other Party, provided that the
         other Party be notified in advance.  Testing shall be performed only
         when the Parties are represented, or have received adequate advance
         notice thereof, using methods recommended by the manufacturer or any
         other method agreed to by the Parties.  At the request of any Party,
         any test shall be witnessed and verified by an independent  surveyor
         mutually agreed upon by the Parties.  Permissible tolerances shall be
         as defined in Schedule A.  Inaccuracy of a device exceeding the
         permissible tolerances shall require correction of previous
         recordings, and computations made on the basis of those recordings, to
         zero error with respect to any period which is definitely known or
         agreed upon by the Parties, as well as adjustment of the device.  In
         the event that the period of error is neither known nor agreed upon,
         corrections shall be made for each delivery made during the last half
         of the period since the date of the most recent calibration of the
         inaccurate device.  However, the provisions of this Section 13.10
         shall not be applied to require the  modification of any invoice which
         has become final pursuant to Section 10.6.

13.11    Disputes

         In the event of any dispute concerning the subject matter of this
         Article 13, including, but not limited to, disputes over selection of
         the type or the accuracy of measuring devices, their calibration, the
         result of a measurement, sampling, analysis, computation or method of
         calculation, such dispute shall be decided by arbitration pursuant to
         Section 16.2.

13.12    Costs and Expenses of Test and Verification

         All costs and expenses for testing and verifying Seller's measurement
         devices as provided for in this Article 13 shall be borne by Seller,
         and all costs and expenses for testing and verifying Buyer's
         measurement devices shall be borne by Buyer.  The fees and charges of
         independent surveyors for measurements and calculations as provided
         for in Section 13.8 and 13.9 shall be borne equally by the Parties.
         When the services of independent surveyors are required and selected
         by mutual agreement pursuant to Section 13.10, then the fees and
         charges of such surveyors shall be borne equally by the Parties.

                     ARTICLE 14 - DUTIES, TAXES AND CHARGES

14.1     Buyer's Burden

         Buyer shall pay, bear or reimburse to Seller all taxes, royalties,
         duties or other imposts which may be levied in Taiwan in respect of
         LNG delivered under this Contract.

14.2     Seller's Burden

         Seller shall directly or indirectly pay or bear all taxes, royalties,
         duties or other imposts which may be levied in Indonesia in respect of
         LNG delivered under this Contract and in respect of LNG Tankers.

14.3     Income Tax

         (a)     It is the understanding of the parties that Seller will not be
                 subject to income tax in Taiwan by virtue of the sale of LNG
                 to Buyer pursuant to this Contract. Further, it is the
                 understanding of the parties that under the income tax law of
                 Taiwan, as amended on December 30, 1989 (the "Tax Law"),
                 Seller will not be subject to income tax in Taiwan unless
                 Seller conducts its business in Taiwan in such a manner as to
                 be deemed to be (i) a resident company, (ii) engaged in a
                 trade or business directly, (iii) maintaining a "permanent
                 establishment" or (iv) doing business through a "business
                 agent" (as those terms are defined in the Tax Law).

         (b)     Seller agrees, at all times during the term of this Contract
                 and to the extent reasonably practicable, to cooperate in
                 minimizing its liability for Taiwanese income tax; in
                 particular Seller agrees to conduct all business and other
                 activities with or in Taiwan so as not to be deemed to fall
                 within any of the four (4) categories specified in Section
                 14.3(a).

         (c)     If Seller shall become subject to income tax levied or imposed
                 by the government of Taiwan or any subdivision thereof, or any
                 government authority in Taiwan, on any revenues, income or
                 profits (including revenues, income or profits resulting from
                 payments under this Section 14.3(c)) derived from the sale or
                 import of LNG under this Contract ("Taiwanese Tax"), Buyer
                 agrees to indemnify and hold harmless Seller from and against
                 Taiwanese Tax. The foregoing indemnity shall be reduced by the
                 full amount of benefit obtained or obtainable by Seller
<PAGE>   55
                 on its income tax liability in Indonesia, whether as credit or
                 deduction, attributable to the payment by Seller of Taiwanese
                 Tax. By way of example, if Seller is assessed U.S.$1,000 of
                 income tax in Taiwan. which is subject to this indemnity, but
                 Seller becomes entitled to a reduction of U.S.$300 on its
                 Indonesian income tax because of such payment, the amount of
                 the indemnity shall be limited to U.S.$700.

         (d)     If following the date of this Contract there shall occur any
                 change in the Tax Law which would result in Taiwanese income
                 tax being levied on Seller with respect to revenues, income or
                 profits resulting from the sale or import of LNG hereunder,
                 Seller shall, upon notice from Buyer, consult with Buyer and
                 take such action as may be reasonably practicable to limit the
                 amount of such Taiwanese income tax.  Nothing in this Article
                 14 shall require Seller to take or forego taking any action
                 which would impair Seller's performance of its obligations or
                 enjoyment of its benefits under this Contract.

         (d)     serious accidental damage to or other serious failure of
                 Seller's Facilities unless such damage or failure is the
                 result of gross negligence on the part of Seller's management;

         (e)     serious accidental damage to or other failure of Buyer's
                 Facilities or the facilities for transporting Natural Gas to
                 Buyer's Natural Gas distribution systems unless such damage or
                 failure is the result of gross negligence on the part of
                 Buyer's management;

         (f)     the Proved Remaining Recoverable Reserves of Natural Gas in
                 the Gas Supply Area expressed in the then most recent

                 obligation to remit payments as provided in Section 10.4 on
                 account of LNG delivered and taken or not taken but required
                 to be paid for under this Contract;

         (h)     delay in completion and testing of any stage of the expansion
                 of Seller's Facilities contemplated by Seller in connection
                 with the performance of this Contract so as to prevent the
                 same from becoming operational on a continuing basis, which
                 delay is caused by delay in receiving major items of equipment
                 or materials from the manufacturer or vendor thereof, provided
                 that Seller shall have taken all steps reasonably
<PAGE>   57
                 available to obtain timely delivery of such items including
                 the placing of purchase orders within such time as was prudent
                 under then existing circumstances;

         (i)     delay in completion and testing of the vessel intended to be
                 used as the Dedicated LNG Tanker for 2000 to 2017 so as to
                 prevent the same from becoming operational on a continuing
                 basis, provided that Seller shall have taken all steps which
                 could reasonably have been expected and which are necessary to
                 fulfill its responsibility to provide transportation under
                 this Contract; or

         (j)     (i) the removal of an LNG Tanker from service due to loss,
                 accidental damage or other serious failure (unless such loss,
                 damage or failure is the result of gross negligence on the
                 part of Seller), or (ii) other  unavailability of an LNG
                 Tanker caused by an event beyond the reasonable control of
                 Seller provided that Seller shall have taken all steps which
                 could reasonably have been expected and which are necessary to
                 fulfill its responsibility to provide transportation under
                 this  Contract.

         Nothing herein shall relieve Buyer of its obligation to pay for LNG
         delivered or to make any other payment which has become due and
         payable under this Contract prior to the occurrence of any of the
         events described above.

         Wells to be drilled in accordance with the Minimum Work Program shall
         be drilled through the Jurassic-Cretaceous Sembar Formation to the top
         of the Chiltan limestone. The performance of the Minimum Work Program
         for each Renewal Period for which the Badin-II Licence is extended is
         the unconditional obligation of the Working Interest Owners. The
         average estimated cost for an Exploration Well used for purposes of
         determining the Minimum Expenditure is US$750,000.

3.3      The Operator shall keep the DGPC informed of the progress of each well
         and shall:

         a)      as soon as possible, make known to the DGPC its proposals for 
                 testing;

         b)      test potentially productive horizons indicated by wireline 
                 recording;





                                                                 [PAGE # ... 11]
<PAGE>   17
         c)      promptly undertake the technical evaluation of the test
                 results and of all other relevant data and submit the same to
                 the DGPC as soon as possible.

3.4      The Minimum Expenditures obligations set forth in Article 3.2 shall be
         satisfied if the Working Interest Owners fulfil the Minimum Work
         Program for any Renewal Period at a lower cost than the Minimum
         Expenditures for such Renewal Period.

3.5      If during a Renewal Period any wells in excess of the number of wells
         required to be drilled in accordance with the Minimum Work Program for
         that Renewal Period are drilled and such excess well or wells fulfil
         the requirements for the Minimum Work Program, then such excess wells
         may be carried forward and deducted from the Minimum Work Program
         required for any succeeding Renewal Period. If for any Renewal Period
         a well required to be drilled in accordance with the Minimum Work
         Program for that Renewal Period has not been drilled, then the
         Licensees shall pay to the Government, as liquidated damages, the AFE
         cost, as approved by the Operating Committee, (excluding costs of
         testing, completion and surface facilities and equipment) of the well
         which was not drilled or, in the event that no AFE has been approved
         for such well, US$750,000, shown as the Minimum Expenditure for the
         well.

3.6      a)      All Exploration Wells drilled by the Working Interest Owners
                 pursuant to Article 3.2, shall be treated as fulfilment of the
                 obligation of the Working Interest Owners, if they have been
                 drilled to the objective formation as provided in Article 3.2.

         b)      If the Operating Committee is of the opinion that it is
                 impossible or impractical due to technical difficulties to
                 satisfactorily complete an Exploration Well to the objective
                 formation, the Working Interest Owners shall drill a
                 substitute well within a reasonable time from the abandonment
                 of such Exploration Well for the purpose of discharging the
                 Minimum Work Program and the Badin-II Revised Licence shall be
                 extended in accordance with the Rules for a period of time
                 equal in length to the time needed for drilling and testing
                 the substitute well.

3.7      Once the Working Interest Owners have completed the Minimum Work
         Program, they shall have no further work obligation with respect to
         the Badin-II Revised Licence for any remaining Renewal Period for
         which a renewal may be granted.

3.8      At the end of each of the first and second Renewal Period, the Working
         Interest Owners shall Surrender an area equal to ten percent (10%) of
         the Badin-II Revised Area after excluding the area covered by the
         Leases granted or applied





                                                                 [PAGE # ... 12]
<PAGE>   18
         for with respect to the Badin-II Revised Area on or prior to the end
         of each such Renewal Period.

3.9      The Badin-II Revised Licence as it relates to any well, the drilling
         of which was begun on or prior to the expiration of the Badin-II
         Revised Licence, shall continue until the completion of any such well
         being drilled.  In the event any such well results in a Commercial
         Discovery, this Agreement shall continue to apply until the
         corresponding Lease has expired. If any such well results in a
         Discovery, the procedures as set forth in Article V shall be followed.





                                                                 [PAGE # ... 13]

         develop that Discovery. In such event, the Working Interest Owner may
         request that the Operator notify the DGPC that such Working Interest
         Owner considers the Discovery to be a Commercial Discovery. Upon such
         determination made by a Working Interest Owner, the provisions of
         Article 8 of the Joint Operating Agreement shall apply to the further
         activities conducted with respect to any such Discovery.

5.2      (a)     For each Discovery with respect to which the Operator notifies
                 the DGPC that the Operating Committee has determined that the
                 Discovery merits the further performance of Exploration and
                 Appraisal Activities, the Operator shall, within a reasonable
                 time, submit to the DGPC an appraisal program and budget for
                 the further Exploration and Appraisal Activities that the
                 Operating Committee has approved to be performed with respect
                 to the Discovery. The Working Interest Owners shall, in
                 accordance with the appraisal program, continue diligently to
                 appraise the Discovery.

         (b)     For each Discovery with respect to which the Operator notifies
                 the DGPC that the Operating Committee has determined that the
                 Discovery is a Commercial Discovery (whether such

                 respect to that Discovery or the Operating Committee has
                 determined that the Discovery is Commercial Discovery on the
                 basis of the initial Exploration Well), the Operator shall
                 submit to the DGPC a Development Plan for the development of
                 the Discovery in accordance with this Article V.

                 unreasonably withheld and such approval shall be granted
                 within a reasonable period of time from the date on which the
                 Development Plan is submitted to the Government.

         In the event that the Commercial Discovery is within a Lease
         previously granted under this Agreement, then the application for a
         grant of a Lease shall state that a new Lease is not required to be
         granted and that the Discovery Area is subject to the terms and
         conditions of the Lease in which any portion of the Discovery Area is
         located. The Development Plan may be a revision of a Development Plan
         that had previously been approved by the Government if the Discovery
         Area to which such revised Development Plan relates is within a Lease.

7.1      The Wellhead Value of Crude Oil and Condensate shall be calculated and
         applied with respect to each Working Interest Owner for the purposes
         of determining royalty as follows:

         (a)     If the President or his designee elects to acquire Crude Oil
                 or Condensate to meet national market requirements under the
                 Rule 41 of the Rules, the Wellhead Value shall be the sales
                 price actually realised by the Working Interest Owners for a
                 Barrel of Crude Oil or Condensate, less the actual costs of
                 gathering, processing, treatment and transportation from the
                 point of production (wellhead) to the point of sale.

         (b)     If Crude Oil or Condensate is sold to parties other than
                 Affiliates in arm's length transactions, the Wellhead Value
                 shall be the sales price actually realised by the Working
                 Interest Owners for a Barrel of Crude Oil or Condensate less
                 the actual cost of gathering, processing, treatment and
                 transportation from the point of production (wellhead) to the
                 point of sale.

         (c)     With respect to all other transactions: (1) to Affiliates, (2)
                 sales by barter or exchange, and (3) sales other than those
                 specified in Article 7.1 (a) or (b), the Wellhead Value shall
                 be greater of:

                 (i)      Actual sales price received less the actual costs of
                          gathering, processing, treatment and transportation
                          costs incurred from the point of production
                          (wellhead) within Pakistan to the point of sale;

                 (ii)     The Wellhead Value per Barrel determined in
                          accordance with Article 7.1 (a); or

         (d)     The adjustment on account of transportation and other costs
                 shall be made on actual cost basis.

7.2      To facilitate computations, the Wellhead Value of Crude Oil and
         Condensate shall be determined at the end of each month as the
         weighted average value of all such transactions that took place during
         the month.





                                                                 [PAGE # ... 25]

7.3      The Wellhead Value of Natural Gas or other gaseous substances whether
         produced from the Area with Crude Oil or Condensate or otherwise shall
         be calculated as follows:

         (a)     If sold to the President or his designee, the Wellhead Value
                 shall be the price actually received as provided for in
                 Article-VIII reduced by all compression, dehydration,
                 liquefaction, treatment and transportation costs incurred from
                 point of production (wellhead) to the point of sale;

         (b)     If sold to parties other than Affiliates at the wellhead in
                 its natural state, the Wellhead Value shall be the price
                 realised from such sale;

         (c)     If sold to parties other than Affiliates, not in its natural
                 state but after processing, the Wellhead Value shall be the
                 sales price actually realised from such sale less the cost of
                 processing, gathering, transportation to processing facility,
                 compression, treatment, dehydration and liquefaction.

         (d)     If sold to an Affiliate, the Wellhead Value shall be greater
                 of:

                 (i)      the price actually received reduced by gathering,
                          compression, dehydration, liquefaction, processing,
                          treatment and transportation costs incurred from the

         1994 provided that the Operator shall not be entitled to include any
         notional cost of Petroleum so used in claiming its business expenses
         for income tax purposes.

7.5      To facilitate computations, the Wellhead Value of Natural Gas shall be
         determined at the end of each month as the weighted average value of
         all such transactions that took place during the month.

7.6      Each of the Private Working Interest Owners shall deliver to the

                                  NATURAL GAS


8.1      Upon a Commercial Discovery and within three (3) months of the Working
         Interest Owners making a written request indicating the recoverable
         reserves, daily supply volume, quality, pressures as well as other
         relevant information, the President will have the option to decide to
         purchase the Natural Gas by making the necessary allocation to a
         specified buyer. Thereafter, the Working Interest Owners and the
         buyer(s) within six (6) months thereof shall mutually agree upon the
         time frame for the construction of pipeline network and other terms
         and conditions including, but not limited to, "take or pay" basis for
         utilization of such gas. If the indication of a specified buyer is not
         given by the President within a period of three (3) months as referred
         to above or the agreement is not reached with the specified buyer
         within six (6) months, the Working Interest Owners shall be free to
         use Natural Gas for power generation, fertilizer production or any
         other industrial or commercial purpose.

8.2      Whenever a Working Interest Owner is selling pipeline quality Natural
         Gas of acceptable specification to the President or his designee, it
         shall subject to Article 9.3, receive a price per Million BTUs
         ("MMBTU"). The price to be paid shall be determined for a six (6)
         monthly period (hereinafter referred to as "the Price Notification
         Period") starting at eight o'clock (8:00) a.m. P.S.T. on 1st January
         and 1st July each year except the first period which may commence from
         the Date of Commercial Production and continue until the 30th of June
         or 31st of December as the case may be. The price to be notified per
         MMBTU shall be computed as follows:

         (1)     First determine the "Marker Price" which shall be sixty-seven
                 and five tenths percent (67.5%) of the weighted average C&F
                 price per barrel of the basket of Crude Oils imported into
                 Pakistan during the first six (6) months period of the seven
                 (7) months period immediately preceding the relevant Price
                 Notification Period.

         (2)     Using the appropriate conversion factor, convert the Marker
                 Price to MMBTU rounding the quotient to four (4) decimal
                 places to arrive at the Marker Price per MMBTU.

         (3)     Not later than twenty (20) days prior to the commencement of
                 the Price Notification Period during which the Operator
                 expects first gas production to commence, Operator shall
                 submit to the authority





                                                                 [PAGE # ... 28]

                 Determining Authority") a calculation of Marker Price in US
                 Dollars to be fixed on the first, day of such Notification
                 Period.

         (4)     Thereafter, Operator shall submit to the Price Determining
                 Authority the relevant Marker Price calculation in US Dollars
                 (applicable to each six (6) month Price Notification Period)
                 prior to each preceding 10 December and 10 June, respectively.

         (5)     The President shall ensure that details of the quantities and
                 C&F prices of the Crude Oils imported into Pakistan as
                 referred to in Article 8.2(1) hereof, are supplied to Operator
                 not later than twenty- five (25) days prior to the
                 commencement of the relevant Price Notification Period in
                 order that they may be included in the calculations to be made
                 pursuant to Article 8.2(1) and (2).

         (6)     Operator shall submit to the Price Determining Authority a
                 draft pricing notification setting out the US Dollar prices
                 resulting from Article 8.2(1) and (2) above for the relevant
                 Price Notification Period at the same time as submitting the
                 calculation pursuant to Article 8.2(3) and (4) above (as the
                 case may be).

         (7)     Such pricing notification shall be published in US Dollars in
                 the official Gazette for the purposes of the Gas Sales
                 Agreement within forty five (45) days of the date of receipt
                 of the aforesaid draft pricing notification.

8.3      For purchases of Condensate and LPG to meet internal requirements of
         Pakistan, the price payable to Working Interest Owners, subject to
         Article 9.3, shall be calculated as under:

         (a)     The price in US Dollars per Barrel allowed for Condensate,
                 delivered at the nearest operating refinery shall be equal to
                 the FOB price of internationally quoted comparable condensate
                 as mutually agreed by the parties. No other adjustment or
                 discount will apply.

         (b)     The price allowed for LPG produced from new projects shall be
                 equal to the C&F price in US Dollars calculated by using the
                 FOB price as reported in a mutually acceptable publication and
                 the freight cost based on proper off-loading facilities at
                 Karachi as may be notified by the Government from time to
                 time.

                       RIGHT OF ACQUISITION OF PETROLEUM


9.1      Should the President require the Working Interest Owners (other than
         Government Holdings) to deliver Petroleum to meet the domestic
         requirements of Pakistan according to Rule 41 of the Rules, the
         following shall apply:

         (i)     If in any year there is domestic demand in excess of the
                 Government's and OGDC's share of production, the President may
                 require such Working Interest Owners to sell Crude Oil in
                 Pakistan on a pro-rata basis with other producers in Pakistan,
                 according to the Crude Oil production of each producer in a
                 Calendar Year. The President shall give the foreign Working
                 Interest Owners at least three (3) months notice in advance of
                 such requirements, and the term of the supply will be on an
                 annual basis. The pro-rata basis shall be calculated by
                 multiplying the excess of domestic consumption over the amount
                 of Crude Oil available to the President and OGDC from the
                 total Crude Oil production in Pakistan, by a fraction, the
                 numerator of which is the Working Interest share of production
                 of such Working Interest Owner less Royalty Petroleum, and the
                 denominator of which is the total production in Pakistan less
                 the amount of Crude Oil available to the President and OGDC,
                 provided that a Working Interest Owner will have available for
                 export (or such other disposition as it may decide upon) in
                 any one year not less than sixty percent (60%) of its Working
                 Interest share of production.

         (ii)    Whenever a Working Interest Owner, other than Government
                 Holdings, is selling Crude Oil to the President or his
                 designees such Working Interest Owner shall be entitled to
                 receive a price in US Dollars per barrel, subject to Article
                 9.3 for such Crude Oil delivered at the cost of the Working
                 Interest Owners to the nearest operating refinery which shall
                 be calculated as under:

                 (a)      (1)     The arithmetic average of the FOB spot prices
                                  during the month of delivery of a basket of
                                  Arabian/Persian Gulf Crude Oils or a Crude
                                  Oil comparable in quality to Crude Oil
                                  produced under this Agreement as mutually
                                  agreed; or

                          (2)     In the event no agreement is reached as to
                                  the basket or a comparable Crude Oil or on
                                  related matters, then the basis shall be FOB
                                  market price of a Crude Oil as may be
                                  mutually agreed which can be demonstrated to
                                  be

                 (b)      Plus freight for marine transportation of Crude Oil
                          from Ras Tanura, Saudi Arabia to Karachi, Pakistan as
                          applicable from time to time for chartered vessels.

                          Oil referred to in Article 9.1 (ii) (a) above. For
                          this purpose the differential shall be determined on
                          yield value based on refinery operating conditions
                          where the Crude Oil will be processed and at mutually
                          agreeable reference prices of petroleum products
                          prevailing in Arabian/Persian Gulf and published in

         exchange prevailing on the date of transaction except as specifically
         provided herein. Payments for any Petroleum purchased from foreign
         Working Interest Owners by the President or his designee shall be by

         (30) days of receipt of invoice. If not so paid, the liquidated
         damages shall be paid on the unpaid balance after the due date at the
         rate per annum of 1.5 percentage points above the London interbank

9.4      The President shall have the right to purchase all or a portion of any
         Working Interest Owners' share of Petroleum in case of a national

                             DISPOSAL OF PETROLEUM


10.1     Each Working Interest Owner shall have the right to take in kind and
         separately dispose of its share of Petroleum produced and saved in
         accordance with this Agreement, the Licence or any Lease at
         competitive prices on arm's length basis under which the consideration
         is wholly cash payable on normal terms. Subject to Article IX and the
         Rules, each Working Interest Owner shall have the right to export from
         Pakistan, free from any export restriction, duty or similar tax its
         share of Petroleum, including Petroleum delivered to it in accordance
         with the provisions of the Joint Operating Agreement, or to otherwise
         dispose of such Petroleum. The President shall issue or cause to be
         issued any permits or authorizations required for such exports within
         a reasonable time and no export duties or other fees shall be levied
         or charged.

         If requested by the President at any time or from time to time,
         Private Working Interest Owners shall use their good offices to assist
         OGDC and Government Holdings in disposing of shares of Petroleum
         produced hereunder at the best available prices; provided that in no
         event shall Private Working Interest Owners be required to purchase or
         otherwise provide a market for OGDC and/or Government Holdings' share
         of Petroleum produced hereunder. The OGDC and Government Holdings
         shall reimburse the Private Working Interest Owners for all expenses
         incurred in rendering to the OGDC and Government Holdings any such
         assistance on a no-profit no-loss basis.

         from Pakistan to countries prohibited by the Pakistani laws,
         regulations and administrative requirements.

10.3     Natural Gas which is not used in Joint Operations, and the processing
         and utilization of which, in the opinion of the Working Interest
         Owners, is not economical, shall be returned to the subsurface
         structure if economical to do so, or may be flared with the approval
         of the Government in accordance with the Rules. In the event the
         Working Interest Owners choose not to process and sell Natural Gas,
         the President may elect to off-take at the outlet flange of the
         gas-oil separator and use, either itself or through its designee, such
         Natural Gas if it is not required for Joint Operations. There shall be
         no charge to the President or his designee for such Natural Gas.

         Revised Area and obligations to pay taxes and other sums to agencies
         of the Government) with Rupees obtained pursuant to this Agreement.

         the official rate of exchange established by the Foreign Exchange Rate
         Committee on the day of the relevant purchase or sale of Rupees. The
         President undertakes that such rate of exchange shall never be such as
         to constitute a discrimination against any Private Working Interest
         Owner in particular or the Petroleum industry in general.

11.7     The Private Working Interest Owners shall pay cash royalties in the
         currencies for which the corresponding production was sold.

         tornadoes, cyclones, typhoons, lightning, explosions, acts of public
         enemy, riot, insurrection or civil disturbance, acts or omissions to
         act of authorities, or other happenings beyond the reasonable control
         of any Working Interest Owner (including the Operator) and will not be
         deemed to be a breach of this Agreement; provided, however, the
         Working Interest Owner will be required to use reasonable diligence in
         overcoming the obstacle, and the performance will be resumed within a
         reasonable time or such time as may be agreed by the parties hereto

         be, shall be extended for a period equal to the duration of the force
         majeure situation and such further period as is reasonably required to

         written notice and shall thereby be relieved of all outstanding work
         obligations and training and social welfare obligations that have not
         yet accrued under or with respect to the Badin-II Revised Licence. In
         the event that the Badin-II Revised Licence is terminated pursuant to
         this Article 14.3, the Working Interest Owners shall have the right to
         be regranted the Badin-II Revised Licence for the remaining period of
         its term within six (6) months after being notified in writing by the
         Government that the conditions giving rise to the event of force
         majeure no longer exist.

         Committee) of the Working Interest Owners, except as otherwise
         provided in Article 5.2 and Article 8 of the Joint Operating
         Agreement.

15.4     The Operator shall conduct all exploration, exploitation, drilling,
         development and production operations in accordance with this
         Agreement and the Rules. In case the Rules or this Agreement do not
         provide for a specific operation, then customary good oil field
         practice will be followed. The Operator shall set up an organization
         in Pakistan with sufficient competence and capacity to conduct and
         perform the Joint Operations in accordance with the provisions of the

         relevant to the area Surrendered. On receipt of the above, the
         President shall enjoy sole proprietary rights thereto, provided that
         each Working Interest Owner may retain a copy thereof for use in
         evaluating any retained part of the Badin-II Revised Area. All such
         data retained by the Working Interest Owners delivered to the
         President shall continue to be subject to the obligations of

         Agreement.

15.6     The Operator shall as far as is reasonably practicable correctly label
         and preserve for a period of twelve (12) months for reference
         characteristic samples of strata or water encountered in any bore-hole
         or well and samples of any Petroleum discovered in the Badin-II
         Revised Area. The characteristic samples of said strata shall include,
         but shall not be limited to, cuts of all cores and cuts of all ditch
         samples. All characteristic samples, including ditch and core samples,
         shall be supplied by the Operator to the President automatically
         without any request being made by the President.

15.7     Any person or persons authorized by the Director General Petroleum
         Concessions shall be entitled, at the cost of the Working Interest
         Owners, to be present at their sole risk during any or all of the
         Joint Operations, provided, that such persons abide by the applicable
         safety rules. The Director General Petroleum Concessions shall give to
         the Operator reasonable notice of such authorizations.

15.8     The Operator may utilize for the purpose of Joint Operations, drilling
         and other equipment owned by OGDC or any of the Working Interest
         Owners (or their respective Affiliates) as may be available from time
         to time, provided that such equipment, in the opinion of the Operator,
         in consultation with the Operating Committee, is suitable and adequate
         for the efficient and expeditious performance of the Joint Operations
         and that the cost, quality, and other conditions for the use of the
         same are competitive with those applicable to comparable equipment
         then available from any other source.

         Working Interest Owners have the right to lift and transport Petroleum
         from each of the Badin-II Revised Area, either through transportation
         facilities owned wholly or partly by them or through access
         transportation facilities owned by a third party.

         The Working Interest Owners and their respective Affiliates and third
         party customers shall have the right and liberty to transport
         Petroleum produced from the Badin-II Revised Area in such tankers as
         they may see fit; provided, that in the event a Working Interest Owner
         or its Affiliates wishes to charter any tanker at any time to
         transport any such Petroleum as they may own or have





                                                                 [PAGE # ... 42]

         available a Pakistani flag tanker which appears to the Working
         Interest Owner or its Affiliates to be acceptable after consideration
         of the age and state of condition and repair of the tanker and
         suitable in all other respects for that purpose, the Working Interest
         Owner or its Affiliate shall give preference to chartering such
         tanker; provided that the duration, rates and conditions of any such
         charter shall be agreed between the parties and the said rates and
         conditions shall be competitive with those prevailing in the
         international market.

                 to abide and comply with the instructions issued by the

                                    ROYALTY


26.1     The Working Interest Owners shall pay to the government a royalty
         equal to twelve and one-half percent (12- 1/2%) of the Wellhead Value
         of the Working Interest Owners' annual gross production of Petroleum
         produced and saved in each Calendar Year from the Badin-II Revised
         Area subject to the Rules and the other provisions of this Agreement.

26.2     Royalty shall be payable in cash and/or kind at the option of the
         Government.

26.3     Royalty in cash shall be payable monthly within ten (10) days from the
         date of the receipt of the invoice proceeds. Payment shall be
         accompanied by a certificate from the Working Interest Owner setting
         forth in detail the basis for computation of the royalty. Such
         certificate shall be in a form acceptable to the Government.

26.4     From the amount of royalty payable in respect of a Lease, there shall
         be deducted the amount of Lease rent paid for the corresponding
         period.

26.5     For the purposes of determining the amount of the royalty due, the
         Wellhead Value of the Petroleum shall be determined in accordance with
         Article VII.

26.6     If the Government elects to take the royalty, or any part thereof, in
         kind, it shall notify the Working Interest Owners in accordance with
         the provisions of Article 26.7.

26.7     If the Government elects to take the royalty on Petroleum in kind, it
         shall initially so notify the Operator in writing not less than six
         (6) months prior to the commencement of deliveries of such Royalty
         Petroleum, and thereafter not less than ninety (90) days prior to the
         commencement of each six (6) month semester of each Calendar Year
         specifying the quantity, and designating the grade and quality of
         Royalty Petroleum that it elects to take, based upon the Operator's
         estimates of production. Final adjustments shall be made within ninety
         (90) days of the end of each Calendar Year on the basis of actual
         quantifies. Such notice shall be effective for the ensuing six (6)
         month semester of that Calendar Year. Failure to give such notice
         shall be conclusively deemed to evidence the election by the
         Government not to take any Royalty Petroleum.





                                                                 [PAGE # ... 58]

26.8     Royalty Petroleum shall be delivered by the Operator, free of cost to
         the Government subject to Article 27.5, at regularly spaced intervals
         at the field terminal unless otherwise agreed. The Government shall
         provide at the field terminal, at its sole expense, all storage,
         transportation and other facilities necessary to receive such Royalty
         Petroleum; provided, however, that if production of Petroleum is not
         unreasonably impaired, the Government may use twelve and one-half
         percent (12-1/2%) of field tank storage capacity for storage of
         Royalty Petroleum free of charge; and if additional storage capacity
         is available and is not required for Joint Operations and is utilized
         to store Royalty Petroleum, the Government shall pay the Working
         Interest Owners at the current rate for such field storage, and if no
         such current rate is established, then at a fair rate to be agreed
         upon in the light of accepted oil field practices.


26.9     Each of the Private Working Interest Owners shall deliver to the
         Government, at the time that the audit report required under 19.1 is
         delivered, a certificate prepared by their respective chartered
         accountants that certifies for its Working Interest, for the year to
         which the certificate relates that (i) its depletion allowance has
         been calculated using Wellhead Value for tax purposes determined in
         accordance with the applicable tax laws, (ii) its royalty has been
         valued using the Wellhead Value in accordance with the Rules and this
         Agreement, (iii) its processing charges on royalty, if paid, have been
         deducted from its operating expenses or declared as "other income" for
         tax purposes, and (iv) the amounts described in clauses (i), (ii) and
         (iii) have been reflected in its audited accounts.





                                                                 [PAGE # ... 59]

27.1     The Operator shall conduct all exploration, exploitation, drilling,
         development, production and other operations hereunder in accordance
         with this Agreement the Joint Operating Agreement, the Rules and good
         oilfield practices. Consistent with this requirement the Operator
         shall endeavour to minimize exploration, development, production and
         operating costs and to maximize the ultimate economic recovery of
         Petroleum from the Badin-II Revised Area.

27.2     The Operator shall not start production from any well before testing
         and making sure to the reasonable satisfaction of the President's
         representative, that the well has been properly completed in

27.3     In connection with Operations provided for and described in this
         Agreement, the Operator shall use the helicopters of Pakistan
         International Airlines Corporation or other Government agencies, as
         needed, provided such helicopters are suitable in the opinion of
         Operator and available on terms comparable to those offered by
         international operators in comparable areas.

27.4     If the President elects to receive the royalty in kind as provided in
         accordance with Rule 37 of the Rules, the Working Interest Owners
         shall deliver the Royalty Petroleum at the nearest operating refinery
         or main transmission system, as the case may be, at the cost to the
         Government for transportation, treatment and storage or as the
         Government may reasonably require, in the same manner as if it were
         the Working Interest Owners' Petroleum.

27.5     So long as production of Petroleum programmed by the Working Interest
         Owners is not unreasonably impaired the President may use twelve and

         Royalty Petroleum, the President shall pay the Working Interest Owners
         therefor at the current rate of storage in the oil fields and, if
         there shall be no current rate established, then at a fair rate to be
         agreed upon in the light of accepted oilfield practices.





                                                                 [PAGE # ... 60]

         Working Interest Owners hereunder shall be reserved for the
         transportation of Petroleum produced by the Working Interest Owners
         hereunder; provided, however, that to the extent, from time to time,
         there is throughput capacity of the Working Interest Owners not being
         utilized, such pipeline capacity may be used by the President for
         Petroleum purchased from the Working Interest Owners and by other
         Petroleum concessionaires in Pakistan, all of whom shall pay the
         Working Interest Owners for such use a fee computed on a unit
         volume/distance basis after taking into consideration the cost of
         construction, operating and maintaining such pipeline or pipelines,
         including depreciation thereof, and applicable taxes, and, for users
         other than the President, a reasonable profit. The Working Interest
         Owners shall not be responsible for the loss during transportation or
