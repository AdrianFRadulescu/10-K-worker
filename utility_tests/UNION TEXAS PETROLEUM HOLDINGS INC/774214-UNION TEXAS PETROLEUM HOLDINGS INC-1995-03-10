ITEM 1. BUSINESS.
 
OVERVIEW
 
     The Company, the successor to a corporation founded in 1896, is a
U.S.-based independent (non-integrated) oil and gas company with worldwide
operations. At December 31, 1994, the Company had proved oil and gas reserves of
411 million barrels of oil equivalent. All of the Company's oil and gas
producing activities are currently conducted outside of the United States,
primarily in Indonesia, the U.K. sector of the North Sea and Pakistan. The
Company also owns an interest in a U.S.-based petrochemical business.
 
     Unless the context otherwise requires, all references herein to the Company
are not intended to imply exact corporate relationships and include Union Texas
Petroleum Holdings, Inc., its predecessors and its subsidiaries, including their
interests in certain partnerships. Union Texas Petroleum Holdings, Inc. was
organized under the laws of the State of Delaware in 1982. The address and
telephone number of the Company's principal executive offices are 1330 Post Oak
Blvd., Houston, Texas 77056, (713) 623-6544. As of February 28, 1995, the
Company had approximately 1,000 full-time employees worldwide.
 
     The Company's principal current international activities began in the late
1960s with its participation in a joint venture in Indonesia and in two
consortia in the U.K. North Sea. In addition, the Company is currently engaged
in exploration and production activities in several other countries.
International oil and gas properties accounted for 100% of the Company's total
proved reserves as of December 31, 1994. A significant portion of the Company's
net income attributable to its oil and gas operations in recent periods
(excluding the gain on the sales of the Company's U.S. businesses made in 1991)
has been generated by its international operations.
 
     The Company's Indonesian activities consist primarily of its 37.81% working
interest in a joint venture that produces natural gas and, to a lesser extent,
oil and condensate from several fields in East Kalimantan, Indonesia. The
Company holds its interests in this joint venture directly through a wholly
owned subsidiary and also indirectly through its 50% interest in Unimar Company
("Unimar"), which is a partnership with a subsidiary of LASMO plc, a U.K.
company. Unimar owns ENSTAR Corporation and its subsidiaries, including Virginia
Indonesia Company, the operator of the joint venture. The Company's interests in
Unimar are reported on its Consolidated Financial Statements as an equity
investment (the "Equity Partnership"). See Notes 6 and 19 of Notes to
Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding the
Equity Partnership.
 
     Natural gas produced by the East Kalimantan joint venture is converted into
liquefied natural gas ("LNG") at facilities owned by Pertamina, the Indonesian
national oil company. Currently, LNG is principally sold to two groups of
Japanese industrial and utility customers, the national oil company of the
Republic of China, a consortium of buyers organized by Osaka Gas, and Korea Gas
Corporation, under long-term contracts originally signed in 1973, 1981, 1987,
1990 and 1991, respectively. In 1994, Pertamina reached preliminary agreements
for the extension of two of its long-term LNG sales contracts and for two new
proposed long-term LNG sales contracts. To supply the additional quantities of
LNG called for by the extensions, Pertamina has committed to construct a seventh
processing train at the Bontang LNG facility and currently is conducting a
feasibility study to determine the need for an eighth train to support the
proposed new sales contracts. The construction of the seventh train will begin
in 1995, and completion is expected in 1998. The Company is also participating
in exploration activities of the East Kalimantan joint venture, as well as
exploration activities independent of that joint venture in other parts of
Indonesia.
 
     The Company's principal properties in the North Sea are interests in the
Piper, Claymore, Scapa, Saltire and Chanter oil fields, the Sean gas fields and
the undeveloped Britannia gas and condensate field. The Company owns a 20%
working interest in the Piper, Claymore, Chanter, Scapa and Saltire fields,
which are operated by Elf Enterprise Caledonia Limited, and a 25% working
interest in the Sean gas fields, which are operated by Shell U.K. Limited. The
Sean gas fields include the North and South Sean fields and the recently
discovered East Sean field. The Company acquired a 9.42% unit interest in the
Britannia field in 1994 for approximately $159 million. The Britannia field is
operated by Britannia Operator Limited, a joint venture between Conoco (U.K.)
Limited and Chevron U.K. Limited. The Britannia acquisition resulted in the
 
                                        1
<PAGE>   4
 
addition at December 31, 1994, of proved undeveloped reserves of 38 million
barrels of oil equivalent. Production from the Britannia field is expected to
begin in late 1998.
 
     Since 1977, the Company has participated through joint ventures in oil and
gas exploration, development and production in the Badin area in Pakistan. Oil
production from the Badin block began in 1982, and gas production began in 1989.
The Company is the operator of the Pakistan joint ventures with working
interests of 30% and 25.5% in the currently producing fields. The Company also
bears 38% of the exploration costs and will receive a 25.5% working interest in
any commercial discoveries in a new Badin concession area. In 1994, the Company
was granted an exploration license and is currently negotiating a concession
agreement for the Eastern Sindh block in southeastern Pakistan, which covers
approximately 1.8 million acres. The Company, as operator, holds a 70% working
interest in the license.
 
     The Company participates worldwide in exploration for oil and gas in both
new venture areas and the Company's producing areas. Current worldwide activity
includes interests in prospects in Alaska, Argentina, Indonesia, Ireland, Italy,
Pakistan, Tunisia, the United Kingdom and Vietnam.
 
     In the United States, the Company operates the Geismar ethylene plant in
which it owns a 41.67% interest. Located near Baton Rouge, Louisiana, the
Geismar facility processes gas liquids feedstocks to produce ethylene, a widely
used petrochemical.
 
     In 1991, the Company consummated three separate transactions in which it
sold its U.S. onshore and offshore exploration and production businesses and its
gas processing business for a total cash consideration of approximately $861
million. The buyers in each of the transactions assumed substantially all of the
liabilities related to the respective businesses or assets that they acquired.
 
     During 1992, the Company successfully completed a financial restructuring
through a series of transactions that significantly streamlined its capital
structure and reduced its financing costs. The Company redeemed its outstanding
$410 million of subordinated notes, redeemed for $200 million plus accrued
dividends its outstanding Series B and Series C Preferred Stock, redeemed for
$300 million its outstanding warrants to purchase the Company's common stock and
repaid at maturity its $100 million senior subordinated notes. In 1992, the
Company also entered into a $650 million unsecured credit facility and issued
$100 million in principal amount of 8.25% senior notes due 1999. Since 1992, the
Company has continued to strengthen its financial position by redeeming for $75
million plus accrued dividends its outstanding Preferred Auction Rate Stock
during 1993 and by replacing its credit facility and increasing its short-term,
uncommitted and unsecured lines of credit during 1994. The Company also improved
its financing flexibility during 1994 with an effective shelf registration
statement on file with the Securities and Exchange Commission that covers up to
$200 million of debt securities that the Company may elect to offer in the
future. For more information regarding these transactions, see Item
7 -- Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of
Operations and Note 8 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.
 
     The Company's strategic focus is to build shareholder value through
developing its core holdings, conducting an active exploration program, pursuing
oil and gas acquisition opportunities and continuing to control costs. In
January 1995, the Board of Directors of the Company approved a $212 million
capital expenditure budget for 1995. Approximately one-third of the 1995 capital
budget is allocated to fund the Company's expanded worldwide exploration
program, which represents an 85% increase over exploration program funds
expended in 1994. A total of $74 million is included in the Company's budget for
exploration activities, including at least ten exploration wells in new venture
areas in Alaska, Argentina, Eastern Indonesia, Ireland, Tunisia and Vietnam, and
as many as 20 wells in ongoing exploration programs in the Company's producing
areas in the U.K. North Sea, Indonesia and Pakistan. The budget also includes
approximately $132 million for oil and gas development programs in the Company's
producing areas, including $47 million for the initial development of the
Britannia field. The Company has also budgeted approximately $5 million for its
petrochemical interests in the United States. During 1995, the Company also
intends to seek acquisition opportunities of both developed and undeveloped oil
and gas reserves as well as to add to its production base in the near-term,
amounts for which are not included in the capital spending budget. The Company
will consider possible acquisition areas worldwide, including in the U.K. North
Sea and Canada.

     In July 1985, two limited partnerships (the "KKR Partnerships"), which are
affiliated with Kohlberg Kravis Roberts & Co. ("KKR"), purchased approximately
50% of the then outstanding common stock of the Company from AlliedSignal Inc.
("Allied"). In September 1987, the Company sold 18,000,000 shares of its common
stock in concurrent public offerings in the United States and outside the United
States. In November 1992, Allied sold, in a secondary public offering, its
33,333,334 shares of common stock, which represented approximately 39% of the
Company's issued and outstanding shares of common stock. The KKR Partnerships
currently own approximately 38% of the Company's issued and outstanding shares
of common stock. See Note 1 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.

    administrative items. See Note 14 of Notes to Consolidated Financial
    Statements for additional data.
(b) Includes assumed U.S. taxes at regular statutory tax rates. The Company,
    however, was subject to the U.S. corporate alternative minimum tax.
 
     As reflected in the preceding table, a significant portion of the Company's
income was generated from its overseas operations, particularly its
participation in the producing fields in the East Kalimantan area of Indonesia
and in the U.K. North Sea. The Company's overseas operations are subject to
certain risks, including expropriation of assets, governmental reinterpretation
of applicable laws and contract terms,
 
                                        3

increases in taxes and government royalties, renegotiation of contracts with
foreign governments, foreign government approvals of lease, permit or similar
applications and of exploration and development plans, political and economic
instability, disputes between governments, payment delays, export restrictions,
limits on allowable levels of exploration and production and currency exchange
losses and repatriation restrictions, as well as changes in laws and policies
governing operations of companies with overseas operations, including more
strict environmental regulation. Foreign operations and investments may also be
subject to laws and policies of the United States affecting foreign trade,
investment and taxation that could affect the conduct and profitability of those
operations. See "Current Markets for Oil and Gas" below and Item
7 -- Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of
Operations.
 
     All of the Company's oil and gas activities are subject to the risks
usually associated with exploration for, and development and production of, oil
and gas, including blowouts, cratering, oil spills and fires. Offshore
operations are additionally subject to marine perils, including adverse weather
conditions, and extensive governmental regulations, as well as interruption or
termination by governmental authorities based on environmental or other
considerations. The Company's petrochemical operations are also subject to
certain risks, including the breakdown or failure of equipment, the performance
of equipment at levels below those originally projected, and explosions, fires,
floods and other catastrophic events. The occurrence of any of these events
could cause injury to life or property, interruptions in operations or increases
in the costs of operations. As is customary in the oil and gas and petrochemical
industries, the Company reviews its safety equipment and procedures and carries
insurance against some, but not all, of these risks. In particular, the
Company's environmental insurance and pollution coverage contain certain
limitations in coverage. Losses and liabilities arising from such events would
reduce revenues and increase costs to the Company to the extent not covered by
insurance. See "Other Business Matters" below.

(a) For the purpose of calculating reserves, oil includes condensate and natural
    gas liquids.
 
(b) Unless otherwise indicated in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, gas volumes
    are stated at the legal pressure base of the area or country in which the
    reserves are located and at 60 degrees Fahrenheit. As used herein, the term
    "BTU" means British thermal unit, the term "TBtu" means trillion BTUs, the
    term "MMBtu" means million BTUs, the term "Mcf" means thousand cubic feet,
    the term "MMcf" means million cubic feet, the term "Bcf" means billion cubic
    feet, the term "Tcf" means trillion cubic feet, the term "Bbl" means barrel,
    the term "MBbls" means thousands of barrels, the term "MMBbls" means
    millions of barrels, the term "boe" means barrel of oil equivalent, the term
    "Mboe" means thousand barrels of oil equivalent and the term "MMboe" means
    million barrels of oil equivalent. Gas is converted
                                             (Notes continued on following page)
 

                                        4

    into a barrel of oil equivalent based on 5.8 Mcf of gas to one barrel of
    oil. The term "LNG" means liquefied natural gas and the term "LPG" means
    liquefied petroleum gas.
 
(c) Information regarding Indonesian reserves relates to the Company's net
    interest in a production sharing contract between the Indonesian joint
    venture and Pertamina. The joint venture has no ownership interest in the
    reserves but does have the right to share revenues and production and is
    entitled to recover most field and other operating costs and capital
    depreciation. The reserve estimates are subject to revision as prices
    fluctuate due to the cost recovery feature under the production sharing
    contract and due to the effect that price fluctuations generally have on
    estimates of recoverable reserves. Debt relating to the LNG processing
    facilities owned by Pertamina is serviced from proceeds of LNG sales prior
    to the distribution of such proceeds primarily to the members of the joint
    venture, Pertamina and the other production sharing contractors. The debt
    obligation is not the obligation of the joint venture. Debt service relating
    to such facilities is accounted for in the Company's reserve estimates as a
    cost of production and operation. Such debt service is deducted in
    estimating future net revenues to be distributed among Pertamina and the
    production sharing contractors, including the joint venture and the
    Company's interest therein. See "International Exploration and
    Production -- Indonesia" below and Note 19 of Notes to Consolidated
    Financial Statements.
 
     There are numerous uncertainties inherent in estimating quantities of
reserves and in projecting future rates of production and timing of development
expenditures, including many factors beyond the control of the producer. The
reserve data set forth in this Annual Report on Form 10-K represent only
estimates. Reserve engineering is a subjective process of estimating underground
accumulations of oil and gas that cannot be measured in an exact way, and the
accuracy of any reserve estimate is a function of the quality and quantity of
available data and of engineering and geological interpretation and judgment. As
a result, estimates of different engineers often vary. In addition, results of
drilling, testing and production subsequent to the date of an estimate may
justify revision of such estimate. Accordingly, reserve estimates at a specific
point in time are often different from the quantities of oil and gas that are
ultimately recovered, which differences may be significant. Additionally, the
estimates of future net revenues from proved reserves of the Company and the
present value of future net revenues are based upon certain assumptions about
future production levels, prices and costs that may not prove correct over time.
Projections about future prices and production levels are subject to great
uncertainty. The meaningfulness of such estimates is highly dependent upon the
accuracy of the assumptions upon which they were based. See "Current Markets for
Oil and Gas" below.
 
     In general, the Company's volume of production from oil and gas properties
declines with the passage of time. In addition, the Company's and its
co-venturers' participation share of gas volumes supplied to support Indonesian
LNG sales contract extensions or additions will be significantly less than their
participation share under the original long-term sales contracts. Except to the
extent the Company acquires additional properties containing proved reserves or
conducts successful exploration or development activities, or both, the proved
reserves of the Company, and the revenues generated from production thereof
(assuming no price increases), will decline as reserves are produced. Drilling
activities are expensive and subject to numerous risks, including the risk that
no commercially viable oil or gas production will be obtained. Increases or
decreases in prices of oil and gas and in cost levels, along with the timing of
development projects, will also affect revenues generated by the Company and the
present value of estimated future net cash flows from its properties. Revenues
generated from future activities of the Company are highly dependent upon the
level of success in acquiring, finding or developing additional reserves. See
Notes 1 and 19 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.
 
     The Company's reserve and production replacement strategy combines
development drilling in proven areas with increased emphasis on worldwide
exploration activities. The Company also continues to seek acquisitions to add
proved developed and undeveloped reserves, such as the acquisition of the
interest in the Britannia field in 1994. The Company's future oil and natural
gas production is highly dependent on its level of success in these activities,
and there can be no assurance that such activities will result in additional
reserves and production. For a discussion of the Company's production, see
"International Exploration and Production" below.

CURRENT MARKETS FOR OIL AND GAS
 
     Revenues generated from the Company's operations are highly dependent upon
the prices of and demand for oil and gas. The unsettled energy market makes it
difficult to estimate future prices and sales volumes of natural gas and crude
oil. Prices received by the Company for its oil and gas production are affected
by a number of factors beyond the control of the Company, including worldwide
and domestic supplies of oil and gas, changing international economic and
political conditions, domestic and foreign energy legislation, weather,
environmental conditions, regulations and events, and actions of members of the
Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries. The Company cannot predict
whether oil or gas prices will remain at, or increase or decline from, current
levels. If oil prices decline, the price for a significant portion of the
natural gas produced from the Company's properties, including the sales price
for LNG, will also decline.
 
ACREAGE
 
     The following table summarizes the Company's developed and undeveloped

(a) The Company also has a direct interest in such wells, which is included

     At December 31, 1994, there were pressure maintenance programs in the U.K.
North Sea and in Pakistan.
 
INTERNATIONAL EXPLORATION AND PRODUCTION
 
  Indonesia
 
     The Company is engaged in oil and gas exploration, development and
production in Indonesia, primarily through a joint venture group it joined in
1969. Under a production sharing contract with Pertamina, the Indonesian
national oil company, which currently covers approximately 1.1 million acres,
the joint venture produces gas and, to a lesser extent, oil and condensate, in
the East Kalimantan area. Substantially all of the natural gas produced by the
joint venture is supplied, pursuant to long-term contracts with Pertamina, to a
liquefaction plant owned by Pertamina at Bontang Bay, approximately 35 miles
from the production areas. At the Bontang plant, gas is converted into LNG in
parallel processing units ("trains") by reducing the temperature of the gas to
approximately minus 161 degrees Celsius. The Bontang plant currently has six
trains in operation, and construction of the seventh train by Pertamina is
scheduled for completion in 1998. After conversion, the LNG is pumped into
specially designed tankers (owned by third parties) and transported to
purchasers, primarily in the Pacific Rim, where it is returned to its original
gaseous form and used for fuel by electric utilities and industry. The Bontang
plant also processes liquified petroleum gas ("LPG").
 
     Production Sharing Contract and Drilling. The joint venture's production
sharing contract with Pertamina grants the joint venture the right to share in
the production and revenues from the contract area, but not ownership rights in
the oil and gas reserves. The joint venture's contract area in East Kalimantan
includes substantial portions of two fields, Badak and Nilam, as well as several
other fields. The joint venture has relinquished 20% of the area covered by the
production sharing contract since the contract was extended in 1990, and is
required to relinquish the following additional amounts: 10% by August 1998, 10%
by December 31, 2000, 15% by December 31, 2002, and 15% by December 31, 2004.
The joint venture, however, is not obligated to relinquish any area from which
oil or natural gas is produced.
 
     The production sharing contract had an original term expiring in 1998, but
in 1990, Pertamina and the joint venture amended the production sharing
contract, extending the joint venture's right to explore, develop and produce
oil and gas in the contract area until 2018. The amended production sharing
contract, which generally contains terms and conditions similar to the
production sharing contract prior to extension, entitles the joint venture
participants to recover most field and other operating costs, as well as capital
depreciation, and to receive, net of Indonesian taxes, 35% of the remaining gas
production until August 1998, and 25% or 30%, depending upon the applicable
sales contract, with some exceptions, of such production for the remaining term
of the contract. The production sharing contract also entitles the joint venture
participants to take their respective shares of oil and condensate production in
kind, and after recovering operating expenses and capital depreciation, to
retain 15% of the proceeds from sales of such production, net of Indonesian
taxes. Proceeds from the sale of oil and condensate (except for that sold
pursuant to the joint venture's domestic market obligation) are currently based
on official Indonesian crude oil prices and reflect world market prices.
 
                                        9
<PAGE>   12
 
     The Company owns a 37.81% working interest in the joint venture (26.25%
directly and 11.56% through subsidiaries of Unimar, the Equity Partnership). The
Company's 11.56% indirect interest is subject to the right of holders of
Unimar's Indonesian Participating Units to receive, until September 25, 1999, a
percentage of certain cash flow resulting from Unimar's interest in the joint
venture. In 1994, approximately one-fourth of the Company's interest in such
cash flow was burdened by such payment obligation. Virginia Indonesia Company, a
participant in the joint venture and a subsidiary of Unimar, acts as operator of
the joint venture. The vote of participants holding 66 2/3% of the total joint
venture ownership interest is generally required for approval of significant
matters pertaining to the joint venture.
 
     At December 31, 1994, proved reserves (net) attributable to the Company's
total interest in the joint venture were approximately 1.4 Tcf of gas and 27
MMBbls of oil and condensate. The volumes of production required to recover the
field, operating and capital depreciation costs of the joint venture are
affected by prices received for such production. The reserve estimates, which
are based on year-end prices, for the Company's net interest in the production
sharing contract are subject to revision as prices fluctuate due to the cost
recovery feature under the contract and due to the effect that price
fluctuations generally have on estimates of recoverable reserves. See Note 19 of
Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.
 
     Substantially all of the joint venture's natural gas production and
reserves are committed to several long-term supply agreements with Pertamina,
which obligate the joint venture to supply certain minimum quantities of natural
gas. The Company believes that there are adequate reserves in the joint
venture's production sharing contract area to supply natural gas under the joint
venture's contractual commitments outstanding as of December 31, 1994. Pertamina
continues to make progress in marketing additional LNG volumes. The percentage
of the natural gas supplied by the joint venture in support of future LNG or LPG
sales contracts, or renewals or extensions of existing long-term sales
contracts, is dependent upon the uncommitted reserves of natural gas that the
joint venture has in its production sharing contract area at the time that
Pertamina establishes the allocation of the natural gas supply for such sales
contracts among the various contractor groups in the East Kalimantan area.
Because a substantial portion of the joint venture's reserves of natural gas has
been committed to support existing LNG sales contracts, the Company expects that
absent the discovery of significant additional natural gas reserves in the joint
venture's contract area, the joint venture's participation in future new sales
contracts for LNG and LPG, or in extensions or renewals of existing long-term
contracts, will be less than its current participation in existing contracts.
 
     In 1994 and 1993, 23 and 29 successful development wells, respectively,
were drilled in fields in East Kalimantan. During 1995, the Company expects to
spend approximately $30 million on development drilling. The joint venture also
continues to evaluate the East Kalimantan area to identify additional gas
prospects. All of these expenditures will be cost recoverable pursuant to the
amended production sharing contract.
 
     The joint venture participants are required collectively to sell
approximately 8.5% of the total oil and condensate production from most existing
fields in the contract area at $0.20 per barrel for domestic Indonesian
consumption. The domestic market obligation is suspended, however, for the first
60 months of production from new fields in the contract area, after which the
price will be 10% of the realized Indonesian export price. These obligations are
factored into the Company's net reserves estimates. Each participant's remaining
oil and condensate production is generally sold in world oil markets. In
addition to the oil and condensate sold for domestic use, the joint venture
supplies gas for domestic consumption, and the amount supplied for such purposes
may increase in the future. Profits from gas supplied for domestic consumption,
which was sold at an average price of $1.06 per Mcf in 1994, are less than from
gas supplied for LNG. Gas supplied for domestic consumption constituted less
than 6% of the joint venture's gas production during 1994.
 
     Bontang Plant. At the Bontang plant, natural gas supplied by the joint
venture and other production sharing contractors is converted to LNG and shipped
in LNG tankers ("cargoes"). In 1994 and 1993, deliveries from the plant were 247
cargoes (108 Bcf net to the Company) and 217 cargoes (96 Bcf net to the Company)
of LNG, respectively. During 1993, the completion of the debottlenecking project
on the first four trains and the completion of the sixth train increased the
production capacity of the Bontang plant to approximately 275 cargoes per year
(from 1.8 Bcf to 2.3 Bcf per day).
 
                                       10
<PAGE>   13
 
     The amount of revenue that the Company receives as a result of the
production of natural gas in support of the sale of LNG by Pertamina is
dependent upon the number of cargoes shipped each year, the Company's ultimate
participation in each cargo, the price the buyers must pay for the LNG purchased
and the costs to be recovered from the proceeds of sales of LNG.
 
     With the completion of the sixth train and the debottlenecking project, the
Bontang plant currently has additional unused processing capacity. The Bontang
plant's ability to manufacture and ship quantities of LNG is dependent upon the
continued operation of the Bontang plant without mechanical failure and without
the shutdown of any processing units in excess of scheduled maintenance periods.
The sale of LNG is also dependent upon the availability of shipping without
interruption and upon the continued operation of the buyers' receiving
terminals. The manufacture, shipment, receipt and distribution of LNG can be
interrupted or adversely impacted by severe weather, acts of nature or other
events. The costs associated with transportation of LNG, such as repair and
maintenance or replacement of LNG tankers, are beyond the control of the
Company.
 
     The Bontang plant is owned by Pertamina and operated on a
cost-reimbursement basis by a corporation owned in part by the joint venture.
The financing of the original two trains was repaid in 1990, and the financing
for the second two trains was repaid in 1993. Financing for construction of the
fifth train at the Bontang plant was provided principally from Japanese sources
through a funding arrangement under which debt service is paid by the Trustee
(as defined below) to the lenders from the proceeds of LNG sales, primarily
under the contract with Chinese Petroleum Corporation ("CPC"), the national oil
company of the Republic of China (Taiwan). Final repayment is scheduled in 2000.
In 1991, Pertamina arranged $750 million under a similar financing arrangement
for the construction of the sixth train and associated facilities at the Bontang
plant. Construction began in 1991 and was completed in late 1993 at a cost of
approximately $700 million. Repayment began in 1994 from proceeds of the Osaka
contract (as defined below), and final repayment is scheduled in 2004.
Financings of the fifth and sixth trains are nonrecourse to both Pertamina and
the joint venture. Discussions are currently under way regarding the financing
of the seventh train, dock and other support facilities. The construction of the
seventh train for an estimated cost of approximately $975 million is expected to
begin in 1995.
 
     Sales Contracts. The joint venture currently has gas supply agreements with
Pertamina that support the long-term and short-term LNG sales contracts and
obligate the joint venture to provide certain quantities of natural gas for
fulfillment of Pertamina's obligations pursuant to the LNG sales contracts. The
supply agreements terminate concurrently with the expirations of their
respective LNG sales contracts. The extent of the joint venture's obligation to
supply natural gas in support of Pertamina's LNG sales contracts and its right
to receive revenues attributable to the sale of LNG under such contracts vary
among the sales contracts.
 
     LNG is sold by Pertamina to two groups of Japanese industrial and utility
customers and to CPC under long-term contracts signed in 1973, 1981 and 1987,
respectively. Additionally, sales of LNG began in November 1994 under a
long-term contract signed in 1990 with a consortium of buyers organized by Osaka
Gas, a Japanese utility (the "Osaka contract"). LNG is also sold by Pertamina
under additional long-term contracts with Korea Gas Corporation ("KGC") signed
in 1983 and 1991 (the "Korean Carryover" and "Korea II" contracts, respectively)
and will be sold beginning in 1996 under the long-term Mid-Cities Gas Companies
("MCGC") contract signed in 1992. Some of the added capacity from the expansion
of the LNG facilities during 1993 is also used to supply LNG sold under
short-term contracts to Japanese, Korean and Taiwanese buyers. The sales price
under the LNG sales contracts is tied to an average of prices for exported
Indonesian crude oil.
 
     In 1994, Pertamina negotiated extensions of the LNG contracts originally
signed in 1973 and 1981, and also reached preliminary agreements for new
proposed long-term LNG sales contracts with CPC and KGC. The 1973 contract will
be extended for an additional period of ten years beyond 1999, and the 1981
contract will be extended for an additional period of five years beyond 2003.
The proposed CPC and KGC long-term contracts will be in effect from 1998 until
2017. While memoranda have been signed by Pertamina and the buyers, final
agreements for the extensions and the new long-term sales contracts are
primarily conditional upon concluding LNG transportation arrangements and, with
respect to the new long-term sales contracts,
 
                                       11

certification of uncommitted reserves. Because the 1973 and 1981 contracts, as
extended, will require the sale of quantities of LNG previously supplied by an
LNG facility other than the Bontang plant, the capacity of the Bontang plant
must be increased through the construction of a seventh train, which Pertamina
agreed in 1994 to construct. Construction of the seventh train is expected to
begin in 1995, and is currently scheduled for completion in 1998. In addition,
preliminary studies are currently being conducted by Pertamina, the joint
venture and the other production sharing contract groups regarding the planning,
development, financing and construction of an eighth train, which could come on
stream early in 2000, to primarily support the proposed CPC and KGC long-term
contracts.
 
     The Company's right to receive revenues from the sale of LNG and LPG under
any future new contracts or extensions or renewals of existing contracts,
including the 1973 and 1981 contract extensions and the proposed new CPC and KGC
long-term contracts, is affected by the allocation of the gas supply obligation
in support of such contracts among the joint venture and the other production
sharing contractors supplying gas to the Bontang plant. This allocation is set
by Pertamina and is based upon uncommitted reserves of natural gas available at
the time Pertamina makes the allocation. The allocation to the Company's joint
venture in such contracts has declined over time since the initial 1973
contract, when the joint venture was virtually the only supplier to the Bontang
plant, to the present when there are several other major production sharing
contractors supplying gas to the Bontang plant and sharing in the allocation of
volumes. Pertamina has preliminarily set the participation of the joint venture
in the 1973 contract extension at 22% based upon the joint venture's uncommitted
reserves as of May 31, 1994, which percentage is less than the joint venture's
participation in existing LNG contracts. This preliminary participation
percentage is subject to final calculations by Pertamina, which should be
concluded in 1995. Pertamina has not yet allocated the natural gas supply
obligation in support of the extension of the 1981 contract or the proposed new
CPC and KGC long-term contracts among the joint venture and the other production
sharing contractors supplying natural gas to the Bontang plant; however, the
amount of natural gas that the joint venture will supply to Pertamina in support
of the 1981 contract extension and the proposed new sales contracts will be less
than the amount of natural gas that the joint venture currently supplies in
support of other existing LNG contracts, and the joint venture's participation
may be less than 22%. A final determination regarding the joint venture's
participation percentage for the 1981 extension and the proposed CPC and KGC
long-term contracts is not expected before 1996. Because the joint venture's
participation percentage will be less, the joint venture's and the Company's
right to receive revenues attributable to the sale of LNG under the extensions
of the 1973 and 1981 contracts and the proposed new CPC and KGC long-term
contracts will be less than that under the original contracts with those buyers.
The Company cannot predict the percentage participation that the joint venture
will have in other future contracts. The Company expects, however, that absent
the discovery of significant additional gas reserves in the joint venture's
contract area, the joint venture's percentage participation in such future sales
contracts will be less than that currently received. See the table presented
below for additional information.
 
     The 1973 and 1981 contracts (including extensions thereof), and the CPC,
Osaka, Korean Carryover, Korea II and MCGC contracts (together with the proposed
new CPC and KGC contracts, the "long-term contracts") contain or will contain
take-or-pay provisions that generally require that the purchasers either take
the contracted quantities or pay for such quantities even if not taken. Prior to
any extensions, the initial term of each long-term contract is approximately 20
years. The other contracts described in the table are short-term contracts and
generally have a term of ten years or less. Of the remaining LNG sales volumes
to be delivered after December 31, 1994, under all of the contracts described in
the table below (excluding any quantities called for by the extensions of the
1973 and 1981 contracts and the proposed new CPC and KGC long-term contracts),
the long-term contracts and the short-term contracts represent approximately 95%
and 5%, respectively, of such deliveries.

</TABLE>
 
- ---------------
 
(a) The joint venture's participation percentage is set by Pertamina based upon
    uncommitted reserves of the various production sharing contractors supplying
    gas to the Bontang plant. The participation percentages determined by
    Pertamina apply to new contracts, or amendments or extensions of contracts,
    entered into during certain time periods. For the extension of the 1973
    contract, and, in general, for sales of LNG during the period from 1994 to
    1999 under new contracts or renewals or extensions of existing contracts,
    Pertamina has preliminarily set the joint venture's participation percentage
    at 22% based upon the joint venture's uncommitted natural gas reserves
    certified as of May 1994. This preliminary percentage is subject to final
    calculations by Pertamina. The Company anticipates a final determination of
    the joint venture's participation during 1995, which the Company does not
    expect to vary materially from 22%. For sales contracts not covered by this
    preliminary determination or by prior determinations, including the
    extension of the 1981 contract and the proposed new CPC and KGC long-term
    contracts, the Company cannot predict the participation percentage of the
    joint venture in such contracts, although absent the discovery of
    significant additional gas reserves in the joint venture's contract area,
    the participation percentage may be less than 22%.
 
(b) Those contracts that show two joint venture participation percentages have
    been amended or extended to provide for additional deliveries. The second
    percentage indicates the portion of gas to be supplied under the amendment
    or extension of such contract by the joint venture.
 
(c) The joint venture's share of remaining LNG sales volumes represents volumes
    available to the joint venture under the sales contracts for servicing its
    share of plant operating and debt service costs, as applicable, and for
    recovering exploration, development and production costs and profit sharing
    between the joint venture and Pertamina.
 
(d) The joint venture has a 97.9% and 27.2% interest in 454 and 447 remaining
    TBtus, respectively, of the total 901 TBtus remaining to be sold under this
    contract. Under the extension of the 1973 contract, the joint venture is
    expected to have a 22% interest in sales of an additional 4,393 TBtus.
 
(e) The joint venture has a 66.4% and 29.6% interest in 1,394 and 157 remaining
    TBtus, respectively, of the total 1,551 TBtus remaining to be sold under
    this contract. The extension of the 1981 contract provides for the sale of
    an additional 925 TBtus. The joint venture's participation percentage in
    this extension, which may be less than 22%, will not be determined by
    Pertamina before 1996.
                                             (Notes continued on following page)
 
                                       13
<PAGE>   16
 
(f) The proposed new long-term sales contracts with CPC and KGC provide for the
    sale of 1,812 TBtus and 659 TBtus, respectively. Such new sales volumes are
    in addition to the 1,248 TBtus, 1,001 TBtus and 173 TBtus, respectively,
    remaining to be sold under the existing long-term contracts with CPC and
    KGC. Sales of LNG under the proposed new contracts will commence in 1998 and
    continue until 2017. The joint venture's participation percentage in these
    proposed contracts, which may be less than 22%, will not be determined by
    Pertamina before 1996.
 
(g) Memoranda of Agreement have been executed between Pertamina and the buyers
    for the sale of these quantities. The joint venture's preliminary
    participation percentage is 22%, as it falls within the time periods covered
    by Pertamina's preliminary determination discussed in footnote(a) above.
 
     In general, the processing costs and operating costs of the Bontang plant
are charged to each LNG and LPG sales contract during each year based upon the
ratio of the sum of BTUs of LNG and LPG processed by the Bontang plant for each
contract to the total number of BTUs processed by the Bontang plant.
 
     Under the 1973, CPC and MCGC long-term contracts and, in general, the
short-term contracts, LNG is sold on a delivered basis (i.e., title and risk of
loss do not pass until the LNG is unloaded at the customers' facilities). Under
the 1981, Osaka, Korean Carryover and Korea II contracts, LNG is delivered
F.O.B. (i.e., title and risk of loss pass upon loading at Pertamina's port
facility). Payments for LNG under all of the LNG sales contracts are, or will
be, made by the purchasers in U.S. dollars directly to a bank in the United
States that acts as trustee and paying agent (the "Trustee") with respect to
sales proceeds. Bontang plant processing fees, debt service with respect to
plant financings, transportation (as required) and other costs are deducted from
sales proceeds, and the balance is then distributed to Pertamina, the members of
the joint venture and other production sharing contractors.
 
     At December 31, 1994, the average LNG price under all contracts supplied
from the Bontang plant was $2.51 per MMBtu, or $2.77 per Mcf. Prices under the
contracts are subject to monthly adjustments. As of December 31, 1994, January
31, 1995, and February 28, 1995, the average price for the group of crude oils
used to determine the price of LNG was $16.17, $17.01 and $17.85 per Bbl,
respectively. The Company is unable to predict the amount or timing of future
changes in the price of this group of crude oils. Every $1.00 change in the
average of the price of this group of crude oils results in approximately a
$0.17 per Mcf change in the price of LNG.
 
     Pertamina also sells LPG produced at the LPG processing facility at the
Bontang plant under seven contracts with Japanese purchasers, each of which is
for a ten-year term. These LPG contracts, as amended, provide for delivery of an
aggregate of approximately 1,950,000 metric tons of LPG (14.4 MMboe) per year,
of which an aggregate of up to 800,000 metric tons of LPG (5.9 MMboe) per year
will be from the Bontang plant. The balance of the LPG is to be supplied by the
Arun plant, a plant to which the joint venture supplies no gas. The joint
venture has 29.6% and 27.2% participations and a preliminary 22% participation
in the gas processed at the Bontang plant to supply quantities of LPG to be sold
under the LPG contracts. Pertamina may from time to time sell quantities of LPG
outside of the seven LPG contracts, and to the extent that such sales are made,
the joint venture expects to have approximately a 22% participation in the gas
processed at the Bontang plant to supply those additional sales. A significant
portion of the LPG sales proceeds from sales under the seven contracts is
dedicated to the repayment of financing of the LPG processing and dock
facilities at the Bontang plant.
 
  U.K. North Sea
 
     The Company's principal U.K. North Sea properties include interests in the
Piper, Claymore, Scapa, Saltire and Chanter oil fields, the Sean gas fields and
the undeveloped Britannia gas and condensate field. The Company also owns a 20%
interest in the Flotta terminal and pipeline system located in the Orkney
Islands in Scotland.
 
     Piper and Claymore Fields. In 1971, the Company joined a consortium of
companies, of which Elf Enterprise Caledonia Limited is now the operator, to
explore for oil and gas in certain areas of the North Sea. The Company has a 20%
working interest (17.5% revenue interest after government royalty) in the Piper
and Claymore fields discovered in 1972 and 1974, respectively. Production from
Piper and Claymore originally
 
                                       14
<PAGE>   17
 
began in late 1976 and late 1977, respectively. After being shut down since July
1988 following a platform explosion, production in the Piper field commenced in
February 1993 from a new fixed platform ("Piper B"). The proved reserves (net)
as of December 31, 1994, contained in the Piper and Claymore fields are 23 MMboe
and 23 MMboe, respectively, including an upward revision for the Piper field of
approximately 9 MMboe recorded in the first quarter of 1994. Average daily
production of oil and liquids (net to the Company) for 1994 from the Piper and
Claymore fields was 15 MBbls and 8 MBbls, respectively. Average daily production
rates for 1994 for the Piper and Claymore blocks were affected by a suspension
of production from May to mid-June due to a natural gas leak. Production
declines from the Piper and Claymore blocks are expected to begin in 1997.
 
     In late 1992, a contract was awarded for the engineering, procurement and
construction of a new platform to provide personnel accommodation facilities for
the Claymore field. The new facilities will replace existing accommodations on
the Claymore A production platform and the floating unit moored alongside. The
installation is scheduled for completion in mid-1995. The Company's share of the
cost of this new platform is currently estimated to be approximately $40 million
through completion of the project. The Company spent approximately $12 million
in 1994 on the platform and anticipates that it will spend approximately $11
million during 1995. These expenditures are fully deductible in the year
incurred for purposes of determining the U.K. Petroleum Revenue Tax ("PRT")
payable with respect to production from the Claymore field.
 
     The Company currently sells, at prevailing market prices, its crude oil
production from the U.K. sector of the North Sea F.O.B. Flotta terminal to B.P.
Oil International Limited and Elf Trading, two major international oil and gas
companies, under contracts with a term of one year. The Company anticipates that
based on current demand it will be able to sell its share of crude oil
production from the U.K. sector of the North Sea.
 
     The Piper and Claymore fields are currently subject to PRT at a 50%
statutory rate, which is based on the net value of oil and gas produced from
each field and on pipeline tariffs. The U.K. tax structure has encouraged
development of smaller fields in the northern North Sea, such as the Scapa,
Saltire and Chanter fields described below, by exempting all or part of their
production from PRT. It is anticipated that only small amounts of PRT, if any,
will be paid on the production from these fields. Production exempted from PRT
provides a greater contribution to cash flow on a per-barrel basis. All
production is subject to the U.K. corporation tax, which is at the current rate
of 33% (27.5% effective rate after benefits provided by the U.K./U.S. tax
treaty). Under current U.S. tax law, the PRT and U.K. corporation tax may be
credited against U.S. taxes. See Item 7 -- Management's Discussion and Analysis
of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.
 
     Saltire Field. The Company has a 20% working and revenue interest in the
Saltire field, which was discovered by the joint venture in 1988. This field is
referred to as an edge oil field because it has a separate field designation,
incurs little or no PRT, has no government royalty interest burden and is
developed as a satellite from an existing platform. The Company developed
Saltire using a fixed platform connected to the Piper B platform. Net
expenditures by the Company for the Saltire development were approximately $180
million through December 31, 1994, inclusive of $5 million incurred during 1994.
The Saltire platform was completed and production began in May 1993. Average
daily production (net to the Company) for 1994 was 10 MBbls of oil and liquids.
Proved reserves (net) at December 31, 1994, for Saltire were 13 MMboe.
 
     Chanter Field. In July 1991, the U.K. Department of Energy approved the
development of the Chanter field, which is also an edge oil field located
approximately 120 miles northeast of Aberdeen on U.K. Block 15/17 (Piper) in the
North Sea. The Chanter field was developed as a subsea satellite to the Piper B
platform and utilized the existing pipeline system leading to the Flotta
terminal in the Orkney Islands. The Company has a 20% working and revenue
interest in the Chanter field. The field comprises two reservoirs, one oil and
the other natural gas and condensate. Production from the Chanter field began in
May 1993. Average daily production (net to the Company) for 1994 was 1 MBbls of
oil and liquids. The proved reserves (net) contained in the field are 2 MMboe as
of December 31, 1994.
 
     Scapa Field. The Scapa oil field, in which the Company has a 20% working
and revenue interest, was discovered in 1975 and is produced using a subsea
production facility tied to the Claymore platform. Scapa is
 
                                       15
<PAGE>   18
 
not subject to a government royalty interest, and it is anticipated that only
small amounts of PRT will be paid on production from this edge oil field. Oil
production from the Claymore and Scapa fields is transferred 135 miles via the
joint venture's pipeline to the Flotta terminal. Average daily production (net
to the Company) for 1994 was 5 MBbls of oil and liquids. Proved reserves (net)
at December 31, 1994, for the Scapa field were 6 MMboe of oil.
 
     Sean Fields. The Company has a 25% working interest (24.375% revenue
interest after overriding royalty) in the Sean gas development project,
discovered in 1969 in the southern portion of the U.K. North Sea. The project,
operated by Shell U.K. Limited, consists of the North and South Sean fields and
the recently discovered East Sean field. Production from the East Sean field
began in November 1994. The proved reserves (net) as of December 31, 1994,
contained in the Sean fields were 24 MMboe, including 3 MMboe attributable to
the East Sean field. The Company believes that the Sean properties have
potential for additional gas reserves and production. The Company expects to
participate in one or more exploratory wells to test structures adjacent to the
existing Sean gas fields during 1995.
 
     The Sean platforms, which currently serve the North and South Sean fields
and the East Sean field, made their first deliveries in December 1986. Under the
terms of a gas sales contract terminating in 2011 with British Gas plc, the
Company will deliver, during each winter contract period, an average minimum of
3.1 Bcf (net to the Company) from the North and South Sean fields, up to the
maximum field contractual reserve of 425 Bcf (104 Bcf net to the Company). This
peak-shaving gas sales agreement also provides that currently proved gas
reserves from the North and South Sean fields may be sold only to British Gas
plc. The price under the gas sales agreement is based upon the volume of gas
taken and various U.K. price indices. The average price for 1994 was $3.16 per
Mcf. The Company also earns a capacity charge during the fall and winter months,
which is independent of production levels, to ensure field deliverability of 600
MMcf (gross) per day. The capacity charge for 1994 totaled $32 million (net to
the Company), and the revenue for the volume of gas taken on 29 days of
production was $13 million (net to the Company). The Company anticipates that,
at current production levels, only small amounts of PRT will be paid over the
next few years with respect to the Company's production from the North and South
Sean fields.
 
     The East Sean field is separated from the producing reservoirs of the North
and South Sean fields, and as a result, production from the East Sean field is
not subject to the peak-shaving contract with British Gas plc. The Company's
share of gas from the East Sean field, which will produce year-round, is sold to
Alliance Gas Limited under a short-term contract. Sales under this contract
commenced in November 1994. Production from the East Sean field is not subject
to PRT.
 
     Britannia Field. In November 1994, the Company acquired a 9.42% unit
interest in the undeveloped Britannia natural gas and condensate field in the
U.K. North Sea from Fina Exploration Limited and Fina Petroleum Development
Limited, subsidiaries of Petrofina SA. The purchase price was approximately $159
million. The Company's total share of development costs for its interest in the
Britannia field is estimated to be approximately $200 million, at current
exchange rates, over a five-year period from 1994 to 1998, with an estimated $47
million budgeted for 1995 for drilling activities and initial platform
fabrication and facilities work. The Britannia field will be operated by
Britannia Operator Limited, a joint venture between Conoco (U.K.) Limited and
Chevron U.K. Limited. Production from Britannia is expected to begin in late
1998. Long-term agreements have been reached to sell a substantial portion of
the gas production in the U.K. market to four purchasers: Kinetica Limited,
Mobil Gas Marketing (U.K.) Limited, National Power plc and Total Oil Marine plc.
As a result of the acquisition, the Company recorded, as of December 31, 1994,
an additional 38 MMboe of proved undeveloped reserves to its year-end oil and
gas reserves. Revenues from the Britannia field will be subject to the U.K.
corporation tax, but will not be subject to U.K. royalty or PRT. For additional
information, see Item 7 -- Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial
Condition and Results of Operation.
 
     Other Information. Payment to the Company with respect to oil production
from the Piper, Claymore, Saltire, Chanter and Scapa fields is made in U.S.
dollars, and payments under the Sean gas sales agreements with British Gas plc
and Alliance Gas Limited are made in pounds sterling. There are no significant

paid to the Company by its U.K. subsidiary are subject to a 25% U.K. advance
corporation tax. Approximately 27.5% of this tax (or approximately 6.9% of the
dividend paid) is available for immediate refunding to the Company by the U.K.
government. All of this tax (including the refunded portion) may be credited
against the U.K. corporation tax paid by the Company's U.K. subsidiary.
 
  Pakistan
 
     Badin Concessions
 
     Since 1977, the Company has participated through joint ventures in the
exploration for, and development and production of, oil and gas in the Badin
area of the Sindh Province in southeastern Pakistan. The Company's activities
are conducted under three Badin concessions.
 
     1977 Concession. In April 1977, the Pakistan government granted exploration
rights in the Badin area to the Company and its co-venturers (the "1977
concession" or the "Badin-I concession"). The Company is the operator of a joint
venture that includes the Oil and Gas Development Corporation, a Pakistan
government-owned company. The oil and gas reserves discovered under the 1977
concession continue to be produced under leases granted by the Government of
Pakistan. The terms of such leases are 30 years from the date that they were
first granted. The Company has a 30% working interest (26.25% revenue interest)
in the 1977 concession area.
 
     1992 Concession. In 1992, the joint venture was granted a three-year
extension of the exploration license that it originally received in 1977 (the
"1992 concession" or the "Badin-II concession"). The oil and gas reserves
discovered under the 1992 concession will be produced under 20-year leases to be
granted by the Government of Pakistan. Production from the 1992 concession is
expected to begin during 1995. The Company has a 25.5% working interest (22.3%
revenue interest) in the 1992 concession area.
 
     1995 Concession. The exploration license granted by the Pakistan government
in January 1992 under the 1992 concession expired in January 1995. In December
1994, the joint venture and the Pakistan government signed a new petroleum
concession agreement (the "1995 concession"). The 1995 concession provides that
the Company will act as operator and will bear 38% of the costs of exploration,
including 12.5% attributable to the Pakistan government. The 1995 concession
provides that the exploration license will be extended for three one-year
periods beginning January 1995, subject to satisfying certain minimum work
requirements. Under the 1995 concession, the Company will explore for and
develop oil and gas on the approximately 1.7 million acres in the Badin area not
covered by leases granted under the 1977 concession or the 1992 concession. As
discoveries are made, the joint venture will apply for individual 20-year leases
in which the Company will have a 25.5% working interest (22.3% revenue
interest), provided the Government of Pakistan elects to exercise its option to
increase its working interest in such discovery to 25%.
 
     The Government of Pakistan is contractually obligated under the 1992 and
1995 concession agreements to issue leases upon the determination of a
commercial discovery and the fulfillment by the joint venture of the conditions
of the concession agreements and the exploration license.
 
     Proved reserves (net) at December 31, 1994, for the Company's interest in
the Badin area were 4 MMBbls of oil and 98 Bcf of gas. The joint venture under
the 1977 concession produced approximately 33% of Pakistan's total domestic oil
output and 10% of the country's gas production in 1994. Average daily production
(net to the Company) during 1994 was 5 MBbls of oil and 43 MMcf of gas. Oil
production and drilling activities in 1994 were hindered by an unusually heavy
monsoon season. The Company's share of the oil produced from the 1977
concession, and the 1992 concession when it is brought on stream, is sold for
both Pakistan domestic use and for export. The price received for oil sold
domestically is tied to the average spot market price of Middle Eastern crude
oil. In 1994, the Company supplied 1 MMBbls of oil (net to the Company) for
export at prices based on competitive spot market rates. The Company and its
co-venturers sell natural gas produced from the 1977 concession area to Sui
Southern Gas Company, Ltd. ("SSGC"). The contract expires in 2003 and provides
that SSGC must either take or pay for the contracted quantities of natural gas.
The Company expects that the natural gas produced from the 1992 concession area
will be sold to
 
                                       17
<PAGE>   20
 
SSGC under a contract with terms similar to the SSGC contract covering
production from the 1977 concession.
 
     During 1994, the Company drilled six exploratory wells in the Badin
concessions, two of which were discoveries. The discoveries included one gas
field and one oil and gas field. During 1995, the Company plans to drill up to
15 exploration wells and three development wells in the Badin concessions.
 
     Eastern Sindh Concession
 
     In December 1994, the Government of Pakistan granted the Company a
petroleum exploration license for the Eastern Sindh block in the Sindh Province
of southeastern Pakistan. The Company will act as operator of the license area,
which covers approximately 1.8 million acres, and holds a 70% working interest
in the license, subject to reduction if the Pakistan government elects to
participate upon discovery of commercial production. The exploration license
will continue for a two-year period, which may be extended for another year upon
commitment to drill an exploration well in the license area. The commencement of
exploration activities is pending the negotiation with the Government of
Pakistan of a concession agreement covering the license area.
 
  Other International
 
     In addition to the activities described above, the Company conducts
evaluations as well as undertakes exploration activities worldwide to expand its
reserve base. The Company has budgeted approximately $33 million for exploration
wells in the Company's producing areas in the U.K. North Sea, Indonesia and
Pakistan. The Company has also budgeted a total of $41 million for exploration
activities during 1995 in other international areas, including primarily the
activities described below. See Item 7 -- Management's Discussion and Analysis
of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. The Company is also
considering the possibility of investing in small power generation projects in
Pakistan and Indonesia.
 
     Argentina. The Company serves as operator and has a 50% working interest in
a 4.4 million-acre offshore tract, known as the Cuenca Colorado Marina-1
("CCM-1"), located in the South Atlantic Ocean about 310 miles south of Buenos
Aires. In 1993, the Company's three-year risk service contract was converted
into an exploration permit pursuant to an agreement with the Government of
Argentina. The exploration permit provides the Company with the option to extend
the term of the agreement until 1999 by electing to drill four wells at varying
intervals during that period. An additional four-year extension is possible if
the Company elects to drill one well for each year of the extension. During
1994, the joint venture drilled the first well on the CCM-1 block. The well
identified oil-generating source rock, but did not discover commercial
quantities of oil or gas. In January 1995, the Company acquired additional
seismic data on the CCM-1 block. The venture plans to drill two additional wells
on the CCM-1 block in 1995.
 
     Vietnam. In 1994, the Company acquired a 25% working interest in an oil and
gas production sharing contract offshore the southern coast of Vietnam. The
628,000-acre block is located in the South Con Son Basin in the South China Sea.
The joint venture, operated by LASMO Vietnam Limited, drilled its initial
exploratory well on the block in 1994. The well did not identify commercial
quantities of oil and gas, but provided important data for use in locating
future wells. The joint venture currently expects to drill two additional wells
in 1995. The production sharing contract with the Government of Vietnam provides
the joint venture with the right to conduct exploration activities through 1997
and grants the venture the right to produce any oil and natural gas discovered
through 2017.
 
     Tunisia. In 1993, the Company obtained an oil and gas exploration permit
offshore Tunisia from the Government of Tunisia. The permit calls for a
four-year exploration program on the approximately one-million-acre Ramla block.
The block is situated about 80 miles offshore in the Gulf of Gabes,
approximately 140 miles southeast of the city of Tunis. The Company will act as
operator and will bear 50% of the exploration costs. In the event of a
commercial discovery, the Tunisian national oil company has the right to
participate for up to a 50% working interest. The permit may be extended for an
additional four-year term under certain conditions. During 1994, the Company
acquired additional seismic data. The Company currently plans to drill a well in
1995.
 
                                       18
<PAGE>   21
 
     In 1994, the Company also acquired a 65% working interest in the onshore
Jeffara exploration permit, which covers approximately 970,000 acres in the
Medenine Region of southeastern Tunisia. The Company's interest is subject to
the Tunisian national oil company's right to participate for up to a 50% working
interest in the event of a commercial discovery. The Jeffara exploration permit,
operated by the Company, has an initial three-year term expiring in 1996, with
an optional two-year extension. The Company plans to drill a well in the first
half of 1995.
 
     Ireland. In early 1995, the Company entered into an agreement to acquire a
25% working and revenue interest in five and one-half offshore blocks
encompassing approximately 345,000 acres in St. George's Channel offshore
Ireland from Marathon Petroleum Ireland, Ltd. and Marathon Petroleum Hibernia,
Ltd., wholly owned subsidiaries of Marathon Oil Company (collectively,
"Marathon"). The Company's acquisition of an interest in the blocks is subject
to approval by the Irish government. The exploration licenses, along with an
additional exclusive licensing option, were awarded by the Irish government
during 1993 and 1994. The operator for the consortium is Marathon. An initial
exploratory well is planned for the second quarter of 1995.
 
     In 1994, the Company also acquired a 30% working and revenue interest in a
joint venture that was awarded 11 blocks offshore Ireland. The blocks cover
approximately 650,000 acres and are located in the Atlantic Ocean about 43 miles
west of Ireland in the Slyne/Erris basins. The joint venture, operated by
Statoil (U.K.) Ltd. ("Statoil"), was granted the right to explore for oil and
natural gas for a 16-year period. During the initial four-year term of the
exploration license, the joint venture plans to acquire seismic data as well as
conduct additional geological and geophysical studies. After the acquisition of
the seismic data and the performance of other studies, the joint venture will
determine whether the geology warrants drilling any wells and continuing the
license.
 
     The Company and its co-venturers, including Statoil, have applications
pending with the Irish government for several blocks offshore southwest Ireland
in the Porcupine Basin.
 
     Italy. The Company has entered into agreements to acquire interests in
three onshore exploration permits covering approximately 217,000 acres in the
Basilicata Region in southern Italy, subject to approval by the Italian
government. The Company will serve as operator of and will hold a 42% working
interest in the Serra Corneta permit. The Company will also hold a 33.33%
working interest in the Tempa dei Mercanti permit, operated by Edison Gas, and a
20% working interest in the Forenza permit, operated by LASMO International
Limited. Geological and seismic studies on the three permit areas are planned
for 1995. The Company has also filed applications with the Italian government
for additional exploration permits covering areas adjacent to the Serra Corneta
and Tempa dei Mercanti permit areas.
 
     Eastern Indonesian. In Eastern Indonesia, the Company has a 60% working
interest and is operator for a group that in May 1991 was granted three new
production sharing contract areas for an initial term ending in 1997 (subject to
extension if certain work programs are carried out), covering approximately 13
million acres (gross) located in the Maluku (Moluccas) Island group in the Banda
Sea. During 1994, the Company increased its interest from 33.33% by assuming the
interest of another participant. The Company completed a program to acquire
seismic and geological data for these three areas during 1992 and 1993. In
February 1995, the Company entered into a new production sharing contract
covering an area immediately adjacent to that covered by the three other
production sharing contracts. The Company also is the operator and has a 60%
working interest in the new production sharing contract. The Company currently
plans to drill a well in the area covered by these production sharing contracts
in 1995.
 
     Papua New Guinea.  The Company serves as operator and has an 80% working
interest in a petroleum prospecting license located onshore and offshore Papua
New Guinea. The license expires in 1996, subject to extension. The initial well
drilled in the prospecting license area during 1993 was unsuccessful. In 1995,
the Company plans to evaluate additional information to determine its future
exploration strategy.
 
ALASKA
 
     The Company also pursues exploration projects in Alaska. At year-end 1994,
the Company held acreage primarily in the Colville Delta, Cook Inlet and
offshore the Beaufort Sea in Alaska.
 
                                       19
<PAGE>   22
 
     Colville Delta. During 1994, the Company participated in the drilling and
testing of two wells in the Western Colville area. The results of these two
wells were not released. The wells drilled in 1994 followed the drilling of
several wells in prior years in the general Colville Delta area, certain of
which wells encountered quantities of oil. During 1994, the Company entered into
an agreement to increase its working interest from an average of 13.2% to 22% in
the Western Colville area by agreeing to bear a disproportionate share of the
costs incurred in drilling two wells scheduled to be drilled in the first
quarter of 1995 to evaluate commerciality. ARCO Alaska, Inc. is the operator of
the Colville venture.
 
     Kenai Peninsula. Effective November 1, 1993, the Company entered into a
three-year exploration agreement with Cook Inlet Region, Inc. ("CIRI"), an
Alaska Native Regional Corporation. The agreement includes an initial option to
the Company to lease approximately 340,000 acres in the Kenai Peninsula in south
central Alaska. Under the agreement, the Company will bear 100% of the
exploration costs and may acquire leases on prospects identified, subject to
CIRI's option to participate in the leases and the exploration, drilling and
development of such prospects. As of March 1, 1995, the Company exercised its
option and leased approximately 14,500 acres and has a remaining option to lease
approximately 75,000 acres, which reduces in stages until the expiration of the
agreement on November 1, 1996. During 1994, the Company interpreted geophysical
data acquired pursuant to the terms of the exploration agreement and plans to
acquire additional seismic data during 1995. Pending favorable results from the
seismic studies, drilling could commence in 1996 or 1997. Also in 1994, the
Company acquired leases on 17 blocks onshore and offshore the Kenai Peninsula
pursuant to a lease sale held by the State of Alaska; however, the holding of
the lease sale is being challenged in the Alaskan state courts. The Company has
a 100% working interest in the leases, subject to CIRI's election to acquire a
20% working interest in certain of the leases under the terms of the exploration
agreement.
 
     Kuvlum.  In 1994, the Company assumed the other participants' working
interest in the Kuvlum federal exploratory oil and gas unit in the Beaufort Sea
offshore Northern Alaska in order to maintain the federal leases included in the
unit for further economic and technical analysis. Two wells drilled during 1993
did not confirm the commerciality of the Kuvlum unit as a stand-alone
development, and the Company wrote off its $25 million investment in the unit.
See Item 7 -- Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and
Results of Operations.
 
PETROCHEMICAL BUSINESS
 
     Plant Operations. The Company's petrochemical business consists primarily
of the Company's 41.67% interest in the jointly owned Geismar ethylene plant
located on the Mississippi River near Baton Rouge, Louisiana. The plant began
operations in 1968. The Company operates the plant, with production costs and
plant production being shared by the co-owners according to their ownership
interests. In 1994 and 1993, the Company's net ethylene sales were 436 million
pounds and 451 million pounds, respectively, and its net propylene sales were 32
million pounds and 27 million pounds, respectively. The Company sells its share
of the ethylene produced by the plant to several major customers for the
manufacture of plastics used in various consumer products. The sales price of
ethylene averaged $0.20 per pound in 1994 and $0.16 per pound in 1993. Sales of
propylene, used in the manufacture of various products such as building
materials, clothing and tires, averaged $0.14 per pound and $0.09 per pound in
1994 and 1993, respectively.
 
     With the start-up of the twelfth furnace at the Geismar plant during
February 1995, the facility has the capacity to produce approximately 1.25
billion gross pounds (521 million net) of ethylene and 92 million gross pounds
(38 million net) of polymer-grade propylene annually. During 1994, the plant
underwent a regularly scheduled maintenance turnaround and therefore operated at
approximately 88% of its rated capacity. During the turnaround, the Company
supplied its customers with ethylene and propylene from storage.
 
     During 1994, the average margin on a pound of ethylene increased from
approximately $0.01 per pound in the first quarter of 1994 to $0.12 per pound in
December. The Company's ethylene margin is primarily affected by the cost of
feedstock (natural gas liquids) and the price received for the ethylene. Low
natural gas prices in the United States and higher ethylene prices, resulting
from tight supplies of ethylene and increased demand, caused significantly
higher margins during the second half of 1994 than in the first half of 1994 and
the previous year. See Item 7 -- Management's Discussion and Analysis of
Financial Condition and Results of Operations.
 
                                       20
<PAGE>   23
 
     Capital expenditures for the petrochemical business were $6 million (net to
the Company) during 1994. The Company plans to spend $5 million (net to the
Company) in capital expenditures for the petrochemical business during 1995.
Expenditures during 1994 and 1995 include costs associated with the installation
of the twelfth furnace.
 
     Storage and Transportation. In addition to the Geismar plant, the Company
owns and operates a 188-mile ethane gathering pipeline system, which transports
feedstock to its ethylene plant from several major suppliers, including the
Company's natural gas liquids fractionation plant in Rayne, Louisiana.
Production from the Rayne plant during 1994 was level with 1993 production. The
Company also operates an underground storage terminal and a 50-mile ethylene
pipeline system, portions of which are jointly owned, to serve the Geismar
facility and several other petrochemical plants in the Baton Rouge area.
 
OTHER BUSINESS MATTERS
 
     Environmental. Various international, federal, state and local laws and
regulations covering the discharge of materials into the environment, or
otherwise relating to the protection of the environment, affect the Company's
operations and costs. In particular, the Company's petrochemical manufacturing,
gas liquids fractionation plant and other facilities for transporting,
fractionating, treating, storing or otherwise handling hydrocarbons and
hydrocarbon products and wastes therefrom are subject to stringent environmental
regulations relating to, among other things, solid and hazardous waste
management and disposal, air emissions, waste water treatment and other matters
that may affect the environment. The Company is committed to managing its
operations in a safe and environmentally responsible manner and believes that
its operations and facilities are in general compliance with applicable
environmental regulations.
 
     Environmental regulations have had an increasing impact upon the Company's
operations. Environmental expenditures for 1994 included capital outlays for
existing facilities, as well as air and water quality projects, and were made
predominantly in the petrochemical business area. Such expenditures for 1994
were not material, nor are they expected to be material during 1995.
 
     The Company is unable to estimate the impact that current international,
federal and state standards and proposed initiatives or other future
developments in environmental regulations may have on future earnings or
operations, but it believes that required expenditures would not significantly
impact its competitive position with respect to other oil and gas and
petrochemical companies and would not be expected to have a material adverse
effect on the Company's financial position. Nevertheless, the risks of
substantial costs and liabilities are inherent in operations such as the
Company's. There can be no assurance that significant costs and liabilities will
not be incurred in the future.
 
     The Company has, in the past, owned, leased or operated numerous properties
in the United States that have been used for the production of oil and gas for
many years. Although the Company believes that its operating and disposal
practices were standard in the industry at the time and were generally in
compliance with then-existing rules and regulations, certain wastes may have
been disposed of or released on or under the properties owned, leased or
operated by the Company. State and federal laws applicable to oil and gas wastes
and properties have gradually become more strict. In addition, the Comprehensive
Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act ("CERCLA"), also known as
the "superfund" law, and comparable state laws impose liability, without regard
to fault or the legality of the original conduct, on certain classes of persons
that have contributed to the release of a "hazardous substance" into the
environment. Under these laws, the Company could be required in the future, with
respect to future Alaskan operations or prior U.S. activities, to remove or
remediate previously disposed of wastes or property contamination (including
groundwater contamination at onshore locations), to perform remedial plugging
operations to prevent future contamination or to clean up disposal sites where
"hazardous substances" from its operations have been taken.
 
     The Company's foreign operations are similarly subject to foreign laws
respecting environmental and worker safety matters. Although these laws have
generally been less comprehensive than their U.S. counterparts, countries in
which the Company does business are increasing their environmental regulatory
and compliance standards. The Company's operations in the United Kingdom are
subject to the Prevention of Oil Pollution Act, the Environmental Protection Act
and related statutes and orders, as well as
 
                                       21
<PAGE>   24
 
certain European Community agreements. The foreign laws, however, have not had,
and are not presently expected to have, a material adverse effect on the
Company.
 
     While the outcome of environmental contingencies, lawsuits or other
proceedings against the Company cannot be predicted with certainty, management
expects that such liabilities, to the extent not provided for through insurance
or otherwise, will not have a material adverse effect on the financial position
of the Company.
 
     Insurance. The oil and gas and petrochemical businesses can be hazardous,
involving unforeseen circumstances such as blowouts, explosions or environmental
damage. To address the hazards inherent in the oil and gas and petrochemical
businesses, the Company maintains a comprehensive insurance program covering its
worldwide interests. This insurance coverage includes physical damage coverage,
third party and comprehensive general liability insurance, as well as redrill,
well control and environmental and pollution coverage, although coverage for
environmental-related losses is subject to significant limitations. In addition,
the Company maintains business interruption insurance on its major international
oil and gas producing interests and on its petrochemical business. The scope,
amount and cost of this insurance vary depending upon various market factors.
 
     Competition. The Company actively competes for exploration leases,
licenses, concessions and acquisitions, frequently against companies with
substantially greater financial and other resources, such as technical
capabilities and human resources. In addition, some of the Company's competitors
have greater experience, especially in other international areas where the
Company is currently seeking to acquire interests.
 
     Regulation of Oil and Gas Production and Marketing. Petroleum production is
subject to various types of regulation throughout the world. Legislation
affecting the oil and gas industry is under regular review for amendment or
expansion, frequently increasing the regulatory burden. Statutes and regulations
require permits for drilling operations, drilling bonds and reports concerning
operations. Also, numerous departments and agencies are authorized by statute to
issue and have issued rules and regulations binding on the oil and gas industry
and its individual members. These rules and regulations pose difficult and
costly compliance and reporting requirements, some of which carry substantial
penalties for the failure to comply. Most of the foreign countries in which the
Company operates have statutes and regulations governing conservation matters,
including the unitization or pooling of oil and gas properties and rates of
production from oil and gas wells. The regulatory burden on the oil and gas
industry increases its costs of doing business and, consequently, affects its
profitability.
 
     Employees. As of February 28, 1995, the Company had approximately 1,000
employees. The Company believes that its relations with its employees are good.
 
ITEM 2. PROPERTIES.
 
     For a description of the Company's properties, see Item 1 of Part I of this
Annual Report on Form 10-K.
 
ITEM 3. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS.
 
     The Company and its subsidiaries and related entities are named defendants
in numerous lawsuits and named parties in numerous governmental proceedings
arising in the ordinary course of business.
 
     While the outcome of the contingencies, lawsuits or other proceedings
against the Company cannot be predicted with certainty, management expects that
such liability, to the extent not provided for through insurance or otherwise,
will not have a material adverse effect on the financial statements of the
Company.

ITEM 5. MARKET FOR REGISTRANT'S COMMON EQUITY AND RELATED STOCKHOLDER MATTERS.
 
     Since September 24, 1987, the Company's common stock, $.05 par value (the
"Common Stock"), has been traded on the New York Stock Exchange and the Pacific
Stock Exchange under the symbol "UTH." As of February 28, 1995, there were
approximately 87,648,932 shares of Common Stock outstanding held by
approximately 330 stockholders of record. Beginning with the second quarter of
1988, the Company has paid regular quarterly dividends on the Common Stock of
$.05 per share each quarter. See Item 7 -- Management's Discussion and Analysis
of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.

ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS
        OF OPERATIONS.
 
RESULTS OF OPERATIONS
 
     1994 Compared with 1993. Net income for the year ended December 31, 1994
was $67 million, or $.76 per share, as compared to net income of $27 million, or
$.31 per share reported for the year ended December 31, 1993. Included in 1993
results are certain non-recurring items; excluding these items, net income for
the year ended December 31, 1993, was $54 million, or $.61 per share. The 1994
earnings were favorably impacted by higher volumes in the U.K. North Sea and
Indonesia, higher U.S. ethylene margins and lower operating expenses, partially
offset by lower oil and LNG prices and higher depreciation, depletion and
amortization expense related to the increased production.
 
     Sales and operating revenues for 1994 were $748 million, up approximately
10% from $682 million in 1993. International revenues totaled $578 million as
compared to $537 million in 1993. In the U.K., sales and operating revenues
increased $52 million as lower crude prices were more than offset by increased
production from the Piper block. In Indonesia, sales were $1 million below 1993
as a result of lower crude oil and LNG prices, which were partially offset by
higher LNG volumes. In Pakistan, sales were $10 million below 1993 primarily due
to lower prices for crude oil and natural gas.
 
     Average prices received and volumes sold by the Company's major operations
during 1994 and 1993, respectively, were as follows.

     Production costs per barrel of oil equivalent ("boe") for the Company's oil
and gas activities averaged $3.98 in 1994, down from $4.73 per boe in 1993
primarily as a result of increased volumes in the U.K., lower LNG plant costs in
Indonesia and the benefits of a Company-wide cost containment program.
 
     The operating profit for the Company's petrochemical operations was $16
million above the prior year. The increase primarily resulted from improved
ethylene margins reflecting higher sales prices for ethylene and lower costs.
 
     The prior year's results included four non-recurring items which in the
aggregate reduced 1993 earnings by $27 million. These items included
depreciation expense of $103 million ($48 million after tax) representing a
write-down of the Company's investment in the Piper field, a $25 million charge
to exploration expense due to the write-off of the Company's investment in the
Kuvlum prospect in Alaska and a $4 million charge for the cumulative effect of
adopting a new accounting standard for postemployment benefits. Partially
offsetting these items was a $50 million tax benefit associated with changes to
U.K. tax laws.
 
     Exploration expenses decreased by $40 million due to the prior year
write-off of Kuvlum, lower worldwide operating expenditures and reduced
expenditures in the U.K. and Indonesia. Depreciation, depletion and amortization
decreased by $74 million due to the prior period's write-down of the Piper
field, which was partially offset by increased production. Interest expense
increased $5 million due to lower capitalized interest related to the Piper
redevelopment project, which was substantially completed in 1993. The effective
tax rate was essentially level with the prior period, adjusted for the
non-recurring items mentioned previously.
 
     1993 Compared with 1992. Net income for the year ended December 31, 1993,
was $27 million, or $.31 per share, as compared to net income of $14 million, or
a loss of $.26 per share, reported for the year
 
                                       25
<PAGE>   28
 
ended December 31, 1992. Included in 1993 results are certain significant items
related to the U.K. North Sea's Piper field write-down, the benefit of a U.K.
tax law change, the write-off of the Kuvlum prospect in Alaska and a charge for
the cumulative effect of adopting a new accounting standard for postemployment
benefits. Excluding these items, net income for the year ended December 31,
1993, was $54 million, or $.61 per share. The prior period's results include a
$76 million charge for the cumulative effect of adopting two new accounting
standards effective January 1, 1992. The prior period's results also include an
extraordinary charge of $20 million for the early redemption of certain of the
Company's debt in early 1992. Excluding these items, net income for the year
ended December 31, 1992, was $109 million, or $.86 per share. The 1993 earnings
were negatively impacted by lower oil and Indonesian LNG prices and decreased
interest income on refunds of prior years' Petroleum Revenue Tax ("PRT"). The
1993 results benefitted from the elimination of preferred stock dividends and
higher worldwide oil volumes.
 
     Sales and operating revenues for 1993 were $682 million, an increase from
$669 million for 1992. International revenues totaled $537 million as compared
to $500 million in 1992. In the U.K., sales increased by $52 million primarily
due to increased production from the Piper and Saltire fields, partially offset
by lower prices. In Indonesia, sales decreased by $19 million due to lower LNG
and oil prices, partially offset by increased LNG volumes. In Pakistan, sales
increased $6 million due primarily to higher natural gas prices and higher oil
and gas volumes. The average sales price for U.K. crude oil decreased from
$18.47 to $15.10 per barrel. The average sales price received for Indonesia LNG
decreased from $3.41 per Mcf to $3.17 per Mcf. The average sales price received
for Pakistan natural gas increased from $1.09 per Mcf to $1.26 per Mcf.
 
     The Company's petrochemical operation's operating profit increased $4
million from the prior year due to lower costs. The average sales price of
ethylene ($.16 per pound) was consistent with the prior year.
 
     Interest income and other revenues in the U.K. decreased by $21 million,
primarily due to lower refunds of prior years' PRT associated with the
development costs of the Piper field. Domestic interest income and other
revenues were $5 million below the prior year primarily due to a lower level of
interest bearing cash investments held during the current year.
 
     Exploration expenses increased by $27 million primarily due to the
write-off of the Company's investment in the Kuvlum prospect in Alaska. Two
exploratory wells drilled in the third quarter indicated that the prospect was
not commercial as a stand-alone development.
 
     Depreciation increased by $166 million during 1993 due to increased
production in the North Sea and the $103 million pretax ($48 million after-tax)
write-down of the Company's investment in the Piper field. (See Note 2 of Notes
to Consolidated Financial Statements.)
 
     The Company's taxes decreased from the prior period primarily due to a
one-time reduction in deferred taxes as a result of a decrease in the PRT rate
in the North Sea, which had a one-time favorable impact to net income of
approximately $50 million.
 
     Earnings per share of common stock were favorably impacted by the
elimination of dividends on the preferred stock and accretion of discount on
common stock warrants. Dividends on the Series B and C Preferred Stock decreased
during the period by $30 million as a result of the redemption of this stock in
September 1992. Similarly, accretion of discount on common stock warrants
decreased in the current period by $5 million as a result of the redemption of
the warrants in September 1992.
 
     In December 1992, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ("FASB")
released Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 112, "Employers'
Accounting for Postemployment Benefits," which concluded that the estimated cost
of benefits provided by an employer to former or inactive employees after
employment but before retirement represents part of the compensation provided to
an employee in exchange for service. The Company currently provides certain
long-term benefits to disabled employees. The Company adopted the Statement
effective January 1, 1993, by recording a cumulative charge to net income of
approximately $4 million representing the estimated future obligation for those
employees currently under the long-term disability program. In prior periods,
the Company's cost of long-term disability was expensed as paid.

FINANCIAL CONDITION AND LIQUIDITY
 
     General. The Company's strategic focus is to build shareholder value
through developing its core holdings, conducting an active exploration program,
pursuing oil and gas acquisition opportunities and continuing to control costs.
The Company's capital expenditures for 1995 are estimated to be $212 million,
excluding capitalized interest, an increase from the previously budgeted $170
million for 1995, which is due primarily to the Britannia field development
costs. Approximately one-third of the 1995 capital budget is allocated to fund
the Company's expanded worldwide exploration program, which represents an 85%
increase over exploration program funds expended in 1994. A total of $74 million
is included in the Company's budget for exploration activities, including at
least ten exploration wells in new venture areas in Alaska, Argentina, Eastern
Indonesia, Ireland, Tunisia and Vietnam, and as many as 20 wells in ongoing
exploration programs in the Company's producing areas in the U.K. North Sea,
Indonesia and Pakistan. The budget also includes approximately $132 million for
oil and gas development programs in the Company's producing areas, including $47
million for the initial development of the Britannia field. The Company has also
budgeted approximately $5 million for its petrochemical interests in the United
States. In 1995, the Company intends to evaluate acquisition opportunities of
developed and undeveloped oil and gas reserves and to add to its production base
in the near-term. Acquisition costs are not included in the estimated capital
expenditures for 1995, but the Company believes that its financial strength and
available credit give it the financial resources to make acquisitions.
 
     As a result of the completion of large development projects for the Piper
and Saltire fields in the U.K. North Sea and a continuation of the growing
demand for Indonesian LNG, the Company experienced record levels of production
from its international operations during 1994, which increased 16% from 1993
levels. The Company's objective is for production in 1995 to exceed 1994 levels.
 
     In developing its business plan for 1995, the Company expects that it will
continue to have excess cash flow available after capital expenditures, required
debt service and normal dividends. The business plan is based upon numerous
assumptions made by management including assumptions as to the volume of oil and
gas the Company will produce from its properties and the prices received for
such production. Pricing for the Company's business plan is based on the
assumption that the spot price of West Texas intermediate will average $18.75
per barrel for 1995. Approximately 90% of the Company's oil and gas revenues are
indexed to world crude oil prices.
 
     Although management believes that the assumptions used at the time in
formulating the business plan and the resultant estimate of excess cash flow
were reasonable in light of world energy, financial and economic conditions, and
the Company's cash requirements, such conditions could change materially, and
actual results of operations, cash flows and use of cash by the Company through
1995 may vary materially from those included in the business plan.
 
     Cash flow from operations. Net cash provided by operating activities was
$215 million in 1994, an increase of $24 million from the same period in the
prior year. The increase was primarily the result of increased U.K. oil and
Indonesian LNG sales volumes and improved ethylene margins, partially offset by
lower oil and gas prices.
 
     During the last six months of 1994, ethylene margins improved significantly
from the first six months of 1994. By December 1994, margins had risen to
approximately 12 cents per pound, up from about 1 cent at the beginning of the
year. The Company's ethylene margins averaged 6 cents per pound for the full
year 1994, and the Company's petrochemical business posted 1994 operating profit
of $24 million. The Company has utilized an average 8 cents per pound ethylene
margin for the full year 1995 in its business plan for 1995. The Company
estimates that a margin improvement of an average one cent per pound for an
entire year at full capacity production can provide approximately an additional
$5 million in operating profit and net income on an annualized basis for the
petrochemical business of the Company. Ethylene margins have averaged
approximately 15 cents per pound in the first two months of 1995. The Company
cannot predict the duration of the recent favorable trends in the ethylene
business. The prices the Company receives for its ethylene are sensitive to many
factors beyond the control of the Company, such as worldwide and U.S. demand for
 
                                       27

petrochemicals, inventory levels, feedstock costs and availability, plant
utilization rates, plant operations and costs and competitive capacity
expansion.
 
     Capital resources. Capital expenditures for 1994, exclusive of the
Britannia acquisition, were $131 million, a decrease from the prior year's
expenditures of $192 million primarily as a result of the completion of the
large development projects in the U.K. North Sea. During 1993, Piper
redevelopment costs were $22 million and Saltire development costs were $23
million. In 1994, the Company spent $45 million in Indonesia, primarily on
exploration and development drilling. In 1994, 1993 and 1992, total Company
capital costs incurred, including capitalized interest, totaled $309 million
(including $159 million related to the Britannia acquisition), $218 million and
$325 million, respectively.
 
     On November 4, 1994, the Company acquired from Fina Exploration Limited and
Fina Petroleum Development Limited, subsidiaries of Petrofina SA (collectively,
"Fina"), a 9.42% unit interest in the Britannia field, the largest undeveloped
natural gas and condensate field in the U.K. North Sea, for 83.8 million pounds
sterling (approximately $133 million). In December 1994, the U.K.'s Department
of Trade and Industry ("DTI") approved the development program for the Britannia
field. As a result of the DTI approval of the development program, the Company
made a second agreed upon payment to Fina for 16.8 million pounds sterling
(approximately $26 million) in December. At year-end 1994, the Company recorded
38 million boe as proved undeveloped reserves associated with the acquisition.
The Company expects to record additional proved reserves from the Britannia
field in the future based on the field's development results and its production
history. The Company increased oil and gas properties and equipment by $219
million, resulting from the purchase price of $159 million, financed through
debt, and an offset to deferred income taxes payable of $60 million. The
Company's share of total development costs for Britannia, at current exchange
rates, is estimated to be approximately $200 million, with $47 million budgeted
for 1995 for drilling activities and initial platform fabrication and facilities
work. Initial production from Britannia is expected in late 1998. The Britannia
field will be operated by Britannia Operator Limited, a joint venture between
Conoco (U.K.) Ltd. and Chevron U.K. Ltd. The Company has contracted to sell a
substantial portion of its share of gas from Britannia under long-term sales
agreements with several large gas purchasers in the U.K. Revenues from the
Britannia field will be subject to a U.K. corporate tax but not to U.K.
government royalty or PRT.
 
     Financing activities. During 1994, the Company replaced its $650 million
unsecured revolving credit facility with three unsecured credit facilities (the
"Credit Facilities"). One of the Credit Facilities is a $100 million unsecured
credit agreement with NationsBank of Texas, N.A. ("NationsBank"), as agent, Bank
of America National Trust and Savings Association ("Bank of America") and Union
Bank of Switzerland, Houston Agency ("UBS"), as co-agents. This Credit Facility
is a revolver that provides for conversion of amounts outstanding on September
15, 1995 to a one-year term loan maturing September 15, 1996. The Company's
other two Credit Facilities are with NationsBank, as agent, Bank of America and
UBS, as co-agents, and certain other banks. One of these Credit Facilities is a
$350 million revolver that reduces quarterly by $25 million beginning July 31,
1997 and has a final maturity of April 30, 1998. The other Credit Facility is a
$200 million revolver that provides for conversion of outstanding amounts on
April 30, 1995 to a one-year term loan maturing April 30, 1996. The Company is
pursuing amendments to extend the maturities on the latter two Credit
Facilities. Loans under the $350 million revolver may be made in both pounds
sterling and U.S. dollars at the option of the Company. Loans under the Credit
Facilities bear interest at floating market rates based on, at the Company's
option, the agent bank's base rate or LIBOR, plus applicable margins, subject to
increase in certain events. In addition, the $350 million revolver allows the
Company to obtain up to $200 million of availability thereunder in U.S. dollar
loans that bear interest at a rate determined in a competitive bid process.
Borrowings under the Credit Facilities are guaranteed by certain subsidiaries of
the Company that also guarantee the Company's senior notes due 1999. The Credit
Facilities contain restrictive covenants, including limitations on incurrence of
additional indebtedness, asset sales and mergers or consolidations. The Credit
Facilities restrict the amount of total indebtedness incurred by the Company and
the restricted subsidiaries referred to in the Credit Facilities, which include
the guarantors and certain other subsidiaries ("Restricted Subsidiaries"), to
$750 million of senior indebtedness (including the senior notes due 1999 and
amounts drawn under the Credit Facilities) and $100 million of subordinated
indebtedness.

<PAGE>   31
 
Debt of unrestricted subsidiaries and nonrecourse debt on certain assets of the
Company and its subsidiaries are not limited under the Credit Facilities,
subject to certain conditions. The covenants also require maintenance of a
certain level of stockholders' equity. Under the terms of the Credit Facilities,
the Company may pay dividends and make stock repurchases, provided that such
level of minimum stockholders' equity is maintained and the Company complies
with the other covenants in the Credit Facilities. Based on current conditions,
the Company expects to pay dividends without restriction under the Credit
Facilities. At December 31, 1994, $326 million was outstanding under the Credit
Facilities bearing interest at a weighted average rate of 6.54% per annum, and
approximately $220 million was available for additional borrowings under such
existing Credit Facilities. At February 28, 1995, $302 million was outstanding
under the Credit Facilities.
 
     Due to the Company's ability to obtain favorable interest rates on
short-term borrowings, uncommitted and unsecured lines of credit were
established with several banks. At December 31, 1994, $106 million was
outstanding under these lines. These amounts outstanding bear interest at a
weighted average rate of 6.46% per annum and are included in the total
indebtedness restriction under the Company's Credit Facilities and reduce
amounts available under the Company's Credit Facilities. At February 28, 1995,
$111 million was outstanding under these lines of credit.
 
     Funding for the acquisition of the Britannia field was through the
Company's Credit Facilities and its uncommitted and unsecured lines of credit.
The Company's indirect subsidiary, Union Texas Britannia Limited ("UTBL"), which
is a wholly owned subsidiary of Union Texas Petroleum Limited ("UTPL"), has
received a commitment, subject to negotiation of definitive agreements, from
Chemical Bank, NationsBank N.A. (Carolinas) and National Westminster Bank plc
for a 150 million pounds sterling secured financing. The financing will be used
to fund the Company's share of the cost of developing the Britannia field to
production (including interest and other financing costs incurred prior to
completion and potential cost overruns), and any remaining availability after
completion may, subject to certain coverage ratios being met, be used to
refinance acquisition costs. Except for certain support by UTPL related to any
potential cost overruns in excess of the facility amount (limited to 30 million
pounds sterling), tax benefits and administrative services, the lenders'
recourse will be limited to the Britannia field project assets and is
nonrecourse to the Company. The financing will have a final maturity in
September 2005. The borrowings by UTBL, an unrestricted subsidiary, would not be
included in the total indebtedness under the Company's Credit Facilities and
will not reduce amounts available under the Credit Facilities.
 
     The Company has an effective shelf registration statement on file with the
Commission covering up to $200 million of its debt securities, which the Company
may elect to offer from time to time and on such terms as the Company deems
appropriate in the form of senior debt securities, which may be guaranteed by
certain of the Company's subsidiaries, or subordinated debt securities. Amounts
of debt securities that may be offered pursuant to the shelf registration
statement will reduce amounts available under the Credit Facilities. The Company
believes the shelf registration provides additional financing flexibility to
meet future funding requirements and to take advantage of potentially attractive
capital market conditions. No securities have yet been issued. In addition, at
the 1995 Annual Meeting of Stockholders to be held May 10, 1995, the Company
will seek stockholder approval to authorize a new class of 15,000,000 shares of
preferred stock. The new preferred stock will provide the Company additional
flexibility to issue from time to time this form of equity based on current
market conditions.
 
     On January 4, 1994, Unimar, an equity partnership, redeemed the 8.25%
convertible subordinated guaranteed debentures which were due in 1995. The
Company's share of the debt redemption was approximately $18 million and was
funded by additional short-term borrowings.
 
     As of December 31, 1994, the Company's scheduled maturities of long-term
debt outstanding for the five-year period of 1995 through 1999 are approximately
$2 million, $2 million, $28 million, $300 million and $100 million,
respectively. The Company believes that it will have sufficient sources of funds
to satisfy these scheduled maturities. The Company is considering refinancing
alternatives in order to extend its maturities. The Company may enter into
interest rate swap contracts from time to time. However, the Company did not
enter into any interest rate swap contracts during 1994.
 
                                       29

     On April 27, 1994, the Board authorized the repurchase of up to 2,000,000
shares of common stock to be used for general corporate purposes, including
fulfilling employee benefit program obligations. During 1994, the Company
repurchased 307,500 shares of common stock at a cost of $5.6 million, a portion
of which shares were used to fund employee savings and benefit plan obligations.
At December 31, 1994, 221,565 shares of common stock were held, at cost, as
treasury shares.
 
     Financial Condition. During January 1993, the Company entered into an
agreement to terminate a portion of its Houston office building lease and
accordingly made a $35 million payment to the lessor in consideration of such
agreement in March 1993 for which an accrual had been made in 1992.
 
     In each of the four quarters ended December 31, 1994, the Company declared
and paid a dividend of approximately $4.3 million on its common stock. On
January 12, 1995, the Company announced a dividend on its common stock of $.05
per share to stockholders of record as of January 31, 1995, which was paid on
February 15, 1995.
 
     Effective July 1, 1993, the British Parliament enacted changes in PRT that
will have an overall positive impact on the Company's operations in the North
Sea. The changes included reforms which reduced PRT on producing fields in the
North Sea from 75% to 50% and which abolished PRT for all new fields not
licensed for development on March 16, 1993. A substantial portion of the
Company's production in the U.K. benefitted from such changes. Also enacted was
the elimination of PRT deductions for most exploration and appraisal
expenditures incurred on or after March 16, 1993, subject to limited
transitional allowances through December 31, 1994.
 
     The functional currency for translating the accounts of foreign
subsidiaries is the U.S. dollar, except for subsidiaries in the United Kingdom
where the functional currency is pounds sterling. The Company's revenues are
predominantly based upon the world market price for crude oil, which is
denominated in U.S. dollars. Certain operating costs, taxes, capital costs and
intercompany transactions represent commitments settled in foreign currencies.
Exchange rate fluctuations on transactions in currencies other than the
functional currency are recognized as gains and losses in current period income.
The Company periodically enters into foreign exchange contracts as a hedge
against fluctuations in foreign currency rates. These contracts are generally of
a short-term nature of three months or less. At December 31, 1994, the Company
had open contracts with a net value of 5 million pounds sterling. However, there
are foreign exchange risks inherent in operations such as the Company's, and the
Company cannot predict with any certainty the results of currency exchange rate
fluctuations.
 
     The Company also cannot predict with any degree of certainty the prices it
will receive in 1995 and future years for its crude oil, LNG, natural gas and
ethylene. In addition, uncertainty in the Middle East, policies of oil exporting
countries and worldwide demand for products affect the Company's sales. The
Company's financial condition, operating results and liquidity may be materially
affected by any significant fluctuations in its sales prices. The Company's
ability to service its long-term obligations and to internally generate funds
for capital expenditures will be similarly affected. See Note 19 of Notes to
Consolidated Financial Statements for information regarding the Company's
estimated proved reserves and sales related to LNG.
 
     Likewise, the Company's business is affected by its costs and success in
finding, developing or acquiring new reserves to replace its reserves depleted
by production. In general, the Company's volume of production from oil and gas
properties declines with the passage of time. In addition, the Company's and its
co-venturers' participation share of gas volumes supplied to support Indonesian
LNG sales contract extensions or additions will be significantly less than their
participation share under the original long-term sales contracts. The Company's
long-term strategy is to increase its production with reserve acquisitions and
successful exploration and development activities. There can be no assurances
that the Company will achieve such objectives. Except to the extent the Company
acquires additional properties containing proved reserves or conducts successful
exploration or development activities, or both, the proved reserves of the
Company, and the revenues generated from production thereof (assuming no price
increases), will decline as reserves are produced. Drilling activities are
expensive and subject to numerous risks, including the risk that no commercially
viable oil or gas production will be obtained. Increases or decreases in prices
of oil and gas and in cost levels, along with the timing of development
projects, will also affect revenues generated by the Company and the present
 
                                       30
<PAGE>   33
 
value of estimated future net cash flows from its properties. Revenues generated
from future activities of the Company are highly dependent upon the level of
success in acquiring, finding or developing additional reserves. See Notes 1 and
19 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.
 
     The Company's overseas operations are subject to certain risks, including
expropriation of assets, governmental reinterpretation of applicable law and
contract terms, increases in taxes and government royalties, renegotiation of
contracts with foreign governments, foreign government approvals of lease,
permit or similar applications and of exploration and production plans,
political and economic instability, disputes between governments, payment
delays, export restrictions, increased environmental regulations, limits on
allowable levels of exploration and production and currency exchange losses and
repatriation restrictions, as well as changes in laws and policies governing
operations of companies with overseas operations generally. Foreign operations
and investments may also be subject to laws and policies of the United States
affecting foreign trade, investment and taxation that could affect the conduct
and profitability of these operations.
 
     All of the Company's activities are subject to the risks normally
associated with exploration for and production of oil and gas as well as the
production of petrochemicals. Also, the Company's activities are subject to
stringent environmental regulations. The Company believes that its operations
and facilities are in general compliance with existing environmental
regulations. Nevertheless, the risks of substantive costs and liabilities are
inherent in operations such as the Company's, and there can be no assurance that
significant costs and liabilities will not be incurred in the future.

                       REPORT OF INDEPENDENT ACCOUNTANTS
 
To the Stockholders and Directors of
  Union Texas Petroleum Holdings, Inc.
 
     In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements listed in the
accompanying index present fairly, in all material respects, the financial
position of Union Texas Petroleum Holdings, Inc. and its subsidiaries at
December 31, 1994 and 1993, and the results of their operations and their cash
flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 1994, in
conformity with generally accepted accounting principles. These financial
statements are the responsibility of the Company's management; our
responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements based on
our audits. We conducted our audits of these statements in accordance with
generally accepted auditing standards which require that we plan and perform the
audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are
free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis,
evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements,
assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by
management, and evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We
believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for the opinion expressed
above.
 
     As discussed in Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements, the
Company changed its method of accounting for postemployment benefits in 1993 and
its methods of accounting for income taxes and postretirement benefits other
than pensions in 1992.

                   NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
               (DOLLARS IN THOUSANDS UNLESS OTHERWISE INDICATED)
 
NOTE 1 -- ORGANIZATION AND SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES
 
  Organization
 
     The Company is engaged in oil and gas exploration and production
principally overseas and petrochemical manufacturing in the United States.
International activities are conducted primarily in Indonesia, the United
Kingdom sector of the North Sea, Pakistan and other strategic areas. Two limited
partnerships (the "KKR Partnerships"), organized and controlled by an affiliate
of Kohlberg Kravis Roberts & Co. ("KKR"), own approximately 38% of the Company's
issued and outstanding common stock.
 
  Principles of consolidation
 
     The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Union Texas
Petroleum Holdings, Inc. ("UTPH"), its wholly owned subsidiaries and
proportionate interests in the assets, liabilities and operations of
unincorporated joint ventures (referred to herein individually and collectively
as the "Company"). Investments in which the Company has between a 20% to 50%
ownership interest are accounted for using the equity method. All material
intercompany transactions are eliminated.
 
  Inventories
 
     Finished product inventories are valued at the lower of cost or market
using the last-in, first-out method ("LIFO"). Materials and supplies inventories
are valued at the lower of average cost or market.
 
  Property, plant and equipment
 
     Oil and gas exploration and production activities are accounted for
employing the successful efforts method. Under this method, costs of successful
exploratory wells, development wells and acreage are capitalized. Costs of
unsuccessful exploratory wells are expensed upon the determination that the well
does not justify commercial development. Other exploration costs including
geological and geophysical costs and delay rentals, production costs and
overhead are charged to expense as incurred.
 
     Major renewals and improvements are capitalized, and the assets replaced
are retired. Maintenance and repairs are expensed as incurred.
 
     Depreciation, depletion and amortization of the capitalized costs of
producing properties, both tangible and intangible, are provided for on the
units-of-production basis. Unit-of-production rates are based on estimated
recoverable oil and gas reserves. Amortization of undeveloped acreage from date
of acquisition is based upon such factors as lease term, estimated evaluation
period and prior experience. The Company reviews its leases and related
amortization rates periodically.
 
     Oil and gas assets are reviewed when they are fully placed into service to
insure that capitalized costs of the asset do not exceed undiscounted future net
pretax cash flows and are further reviewed annually on a country-by-country
basis.
 
     Estimated dismantlement, restoration and abandonment costs net of estimated
salvage value are taken into account in determining amortization. Depreciable
assets other than oil and gas properties are depreciated using the straight-line
method based on estimated asset service lives from 3 to 31 years.
 
  Income taxes
 
     In February 1992, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ("FASB")
released Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 109, "Accounting for
Income Taxes," which requires an asset and liability approach for financial
accounting and reporting of income taxes. The Company adopted the Statement
 
                                       38

           NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS -- (CONTINUED)
               (DOLLARS IN THOUSANDS UNLESS OTHERWISE INDICATED)
 
effective January 1, 1992, by recording a cumulative charge to net income of $31
million representing the effect on prior years of adopting the Statement;
otherwise, adoption of the standard did not materially impact 1992 results of
operations.
 
     Under this accounting standard, a deferred tax liability or asset is
recorded for future tax consequences arising from differences between the
financial accounting and tax basis of the assets and liabilities of the Company.
An impairment evaluation, with reserves recorded as necessary for any tax
benefit not expected to be realized, is required of deferred tax assets.
Deferred tax liabilities or assets are adjusted for changes in income tax laws
or rates when enacted. Deferred tax expense or benefit is derived from changes
in deferred tax liabilities or assets. A current tax expense or benefit is
recognized for the estimated taxes payable or refundable on tax returns for the
current year.
 
     Under the corporate alternative minimum tax ("AMT"), the Company's U.S. tax
liability is the greater of its regular tax or the AMT. To the extent that the
Company's AMT liability exceeds its otherwise determined tax liability, an AMT
credit may be generated and this credit may be applied against future tax
liabilities.
 
  Postretirement health care benefits
 
     In December 1990, the FASB released Statement of Financial Accounting
Standards No. 106, "Employers' Accounting for Postretirement Benefits Other Than
Pensions," which concluded that postretirement benefits represent a form of
deferred compensation and that the cost and obligation should be recognized
based on service. The Statement contains provisions that are similar to the
FASB's approach to accounting for pension costs. The Company adopted the
Statement effective January 1, 1992, by recording a cumulative charge to net
income of approximately $45 million representing the effect on prior years of
adopting the Statement; otherwise, adoption of the standard did not materially
impact 1992 results of operations.
 
  Postemployment benefits
 
     In December 1992, the FASB released Statement of Financial Accounting
Standards No. 112, "Employers' Accounting for Postemployment Benefits," which
concluded that the estimated cost of benefits provided by an employer to former
or inactive employees after employment but before retirement represents part of
the compensation provided to an employee in exchange for service. The Company
currently provides certain long-term benefits to disabled employees. The Company
adopted the Statement effective January 1, 1993, by recording a cumulative
charge to net income of approximately $4 million representing the estimated
future obligation for those employees currently under the long-term disability
program. In prior periods, the Company's cost of long-term disability was
expensed as paid.
 
  Foreign currency
 
     The functional currency for translating the accounts of foreign
subsidiaries is the U.S. dollar, except for subsidiaries in the United Kingdom,
where the functional currency is the local currency. Translation adjustments of
this local currency, which represent unrealized increases and decreases in the
Company's net investment in foreign operations as the result of exchange rate
changes, are included in stockholders' equity as the cumulative foreign exchange
translation adjustment. Transaction gains and losses resulting from the effect
of exchange rate fluctuations on transactions in currencies other than the
functional currency are included in determining net income. Foreign exchange
gains (losses) included in the determination of net income for the years 1994,
1993, and 1992 were ($178), $492, and ($4,318), respectively.

           NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS -- (CONTINUED)
               (DOLLARS IN THOUSANDS UNLESS OTHERWISE INDICATED)
 
  Foreign exchange contracts
 
     The Company periodically enters into foreign exchange contracts as a hedge
against fluctuations in foreign currency rates. These contracts hedge economic
exposures. For contracts that hedge specific transactions, market value gains
and losses are deferred and recognized as a component of cost of the transaction
upon consummation. For contracts that hedge economic exposures, market value
gains and losses are recognized in the period in which they occur.
 
  Other
 
     The fair value of financial instruments included in the Company's assets
and liabilities approximates carrying value. Cash equivalents are comprised of
highly liquid debt instruments purchased at a maturity of three months or less.
 
NOTE 2 -- PIPER FIELD WRITE-DOWN
 
     It is the policy of the Company to review oil and gas assets when they are
fully placed in service to insure that capitalized costs of the asset do not
exceed undiscounted future net pretax cash flows. In the third quarter of 1993,
as a result of the crude oil price environment, it was determined that estimated
future net pretax cash flows from the U.K. Piper field did not exceed
capitalized costs of the field, and accordingly, the Company recorded a $103
million pretax, non-cash charge to depreciation, depletion and amortization.
After including the reversal of $55 million of related U.K. deferred income
taxes, the net income impact of the charge was $48 million.
 
NOTE 3 -- OTHER CHARGES, NET
 
     The following pretax charges (credits) are reflected in the Company's
Consolidated Statement of Operations as other charges, net for the year ended
December 31, 1992:

     In January 1992, the Company sold its wholly owned subsidiary, Unola de
Argentina Ltd. ("Unola"), which held a minority interest in an onshore Argentine
oil production service contract, for approximately $16 million and recorded a
gain of $6 million. This sale did not include the Company's exploration acreage
offshore Argentina.
 
     During January 1993, the Company entered into an agreement to terminate a
portion of its Houston office building lease and in March 1993 made a payment to
the lessor of $35 million in consideration of such agreement.

     In November 1994, the Company acquired a 9.42% unit interest from Fina
Exploration Limited and Fina Petroleum Development Limited, subsidiaries of
Petrofina SA (collectively, "Fina") in two blocks in the undeveloped Britannia
natural gas and condensate field in the U.K. North Sea for 83.8 million pounds
sterling (approximately $133 million). In December 1994, the U.K. Department of
Trade and Industry ("DTI") approved the development program for the Britannia
field. As a result of the DTI approval of the development program, the Company
made a second agreed upon payment to Fina for 16.8 million pounds sterling
(approximately $26 million) in December. Production from Britannia is planned to
begin in late 1998. The Company increased oil and gas properties and equipment
by $219 million, resulting from the purchase price of $159 million, financed
through debt, and an offset to deferred income taxes payable of $60 million.

  Credit Facilities
 
     During 1994, the Company replaced its $650 million unsecured revolving
credit facility with three unsecured credit facilities (the "Credit
Facilities"). One of the Credit Facilities is a $100 million unsecured credit
agreement with NationsBank of Texas, N.A., as agent, Bank of America National
Trust and Savings Association and Union Bank of Switzerland, Houston Agency, as
co-agents. This Credit Facility is a revolver that provides for conversion of
amounts outstanding on September 15, 1995 to a one-year term loan maturing
September 15, 1996, if drawn. The Company's other two Credit Facilities are with
NationsBank of Texas, N.A., as agent, Bank of America National Trust and Savings
Association and Union Bank of Switzerland, Houston Agency, as co-agents, and
certain other banks. One of these Credit Facilities is a $350 million revolver
that reduces quarterly by $25 million beginning July 31, 1997 and has a final
maturity of April 30, 1998. The other Credit Facility is a $200 million revolver
that provides for conversion of outstanding amounts on April 30, 1995 to a
one-year term loan maturing April 30, 1996. Borrowings are guaranteed by certain
subsidiaries of the Company that also guarantee the Notes (see Note 20). The
Credit Facilities contain restrictive covenants, including limitations on
incurrence of additional indebtedness, asset sales and mergers or
consolidations. The Credit Facilities restrict the amount of total indebtedness
incurred by the Company and the restricted subsidiaries referred to in the
Credit Facilities, which include the guarantors and certain other subsidiaries
("Restricted Subsidiaries"), to $750 million of senior indebtedness (including
the Notes and amounts drawn under the Credit Facilities) and $100 million of
subordinated indebtedness. Debt of unrestricted subsidiaries and nonrecourse
debt on certain assets of the Company and its subsidiaries are not limited under
the Credit Facilities, subject to certain conditions. The covenants also require
maintenance of a certain level of stockholders' equity. Loans under the $350
million revolver may be made in both pounds sterling and U.S. dollars, at the
option of the Company. Loans under the Credit Facilities bear interest at
floating market rates based on, at the Company's option, the agent bank's base
rate or LIBOR, plus applicable margins, subject to increase in certain events.
In addition, the $350 million revolver allows the Company to obtain up to $200
million of availability thereunder in U.S. dollar loans that bear interest at a
rate determined in a competitive bid process. At December 31, 1994, outstanding
borrowings bore interest at a weighted average of 6.54% per annum. The Credit
Facilities provide the Company with the ability to borrow on a long-term basis,
and as it is the Company's intent to do so, such borrowings are classified as
long-term.
 
  Senior Notes
 
     In November 1992, the Company sold $100 million principal amount, at an
initial offering price of 99.424%, of 8.25% Senior Notes due November 15, 1999
(the "Notes") for approximately $98 million (after deducting underwriting
discounts, commission and offering expenses). The Company used such proceeds to
reduce then outstanding debt under its credit facility. The Notes represent
general unsecured obligations of the Company and rank pari passu in right of
payment with the Company's obligations under its Credit Facilities and senior in
right of payment to any future subordinated indebtedness of the Company. The
Notes

           NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS -- (CONTINUED)
               (DOLLARS IN THOUSANDS UNLESS OTHERWISE INDICATED)
 
are guaranteed by the subsidiaries that are guarantors under the Credit
Facilities (see Note 20). The Notes are redeemable at any time, at the option of
the Company, in whole or in part, at a price equal to 100% of the principal
amount plus accrued interest plus a make-whole premium relating to the
then-prevailing Treasury Yield and the remaining life of the Notes.
 
  Subsidiary Production Loan
 
     Union Texas Pakistan, Inc., a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company, has a
nonrecourse loan, payable from production proceeds, which will be repaid in
semiannual installments of $1,146 through 1997, and bears interest at the
182-day Treasury bill rate plus 1.0%. At December 31, 1994, such interest rate
was 7.53%.
 
  Short-term Debt
 
     Uncommitted and unsecured lines of credit are established with several
banks in both U.S. dollars and pounds sterling. At December 31, 1994, $106
million was outstanding under these lines, which bore interest at a weighted
average rate of 6.46% per annum. These amounts are included in the total
indebtedness restriction under the Company's Credit Facilities, thereby reducing
amounts available under the Company's Credit Facilities.
 
  Subordinated Debt
 
     In February 1992, the Company redeemed all of its outstanding $100 million
Senior Subordinated Reset Notes due November 1, 1993, at a redemption price of
103.125% together with accrued interest, and all of its outstanding $310 million
13% Subordinated Notes due July 1, 1995, at a redemption price of 104% together
with accrued interest. The notes were redeemed by using existing cash balances.
As a result, an extraordinary loss of $20 million was recorded representing the
debt premium and the remaining unamortized issuance cost. The $100 million
Senior Subordinated Floating Rate Notes due November 1, 1992 were repaid at
maturity with borrowings under the Company's credit facility.
 
     Interest capitalized for the years 1994, 1993 and 1992 was $18,774, $25,674
and $17,215, respectively.
 
     Scheduled maturities of long-term debt outstanding during the five years
1995 through 1999 are $2,292, $2,292, $27,793, $300,000 and $100,000,
respectively.

     Effective July 1, 1993, the British Parliament enacted changes in the U.K.
Petroleum Revenue Tax ("PRT"). These changes included reducing PRT on producing
fields in the U.K. North Sea from 75% to 50% and abolishing PRT for all new
fields not licensed for development on March 16, 1993. Accordingly, in the third
quarter of 1993, the Company reduced its liability for U.K. deferred income
taxes and recorded a one-time benefit to net income of approximately $50
million.
 
     Deferred tax liabilities (assets) are comprised of the effects of temporary
differences as follows:

NOTE 10 -- PENSION BENEFITS
 
     The Union Texas Petroleum Salaried Employees' Pension Plan (the "Pension
Plan") covers substantially all employees. Plan benefits are generally based on
years of service and an employee's compensation levels during the last years of
employment. The Company's funding policy is to contribute annually an amount at
least equal to the minimum funding requirement of the Employee Retirement Income
Security Act of 1974.
 
     The Union Texas Petroleum Supplemental Retirement Plans ("Supplemental
Retirement Plans") cover certain employees whose pension benefits were affected
by changes in the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, and certain other
benefit limitations of the Internal Revenue Code. The supplemental plans are
unfunded.

     Settlement losses resulted from certain lump sum payments to employees who
terminated from participation in the Supplemental Retirement Plans during the
year. Net periodic pension expense decreased from 1992 due primarily to changes
in actuarial assumptions and gain and loss experience.
 
     The assumed average rate of return on plan assets was 8% in 1994, 1993 and
1992 for the plans. Measurement of the projected benefit obligation was based on
an assumed discount rate of 8.5% and 7% in 1994, 7.5% and 7% in 1993 and 8% and
6.5% in 1992 for normal and lump sum eligible participants, respectively, for
the Pension and Supplemental Retirement Plans and an assumed long-term rate of
compensation increase of 4.5%, 5% and 5% for the Pension and Supplemental
Retirement Plans in 1994, 1993 and 1992, respectively.

NOTE 11 -- OTHER POSTRETIREMENT BENEFITS
 
     The Company currently provides postretirement benefits, principally health
care and life insurance benefits, for employees. Under the Company's current
policy, substantially all of the Company's employees may become eligible for
those benefits if they reach normal retirement age with ten years of service
while working for the Company. These benefits are unfunded.

     Measurement of the accumulated postretirement benefit obligation was based
on an assumed discount rate of 8.5% for 1994, 7.5% for 1993, and 8% for 1992.
For measurement purposes, a 12.75%, 13.5% and 14.25% annual rate of increase in
the per capita cost of covered health care benefits for those age 65 and older
were assumed for 1994, 1993 and 1992, respectively; the rate was assumed to
decrease linearly to 6% for 2003 and after. The health care cost trend rate
assumption has a significant effect on the amounts reported. Increasing the
assumed health care cost trend rates by 1% in each year would increase the
accumulated postretirement benefit obligation as of December 31, 1994 and 1993,
by $1,451 and $1,479, respectively. Additionally, it would increase the
aggregate of the service and interest cost components of net periodic
postretirement benefit cost for the years ended December 31, 1994, 1993 and 1992
by $176, $151 and $469, respectively.

(a) Petrochemicals operations and Other represent United States activities.
 
NOTE 15 -- COMMITMENTS
 
     The Company has entered into various commitments and operating agreements
related to the development of and production from certain proved oil and gas
properties. Also during the normal course of business, the Company has issued
various letters of credit, bank guarantees and performance bonds, which at
December 31, 1994, totaled $12 million. At December 31, 1994, the Company had
open foreign exchange contracts with a net value of 5 million pounds sterling.
These contracts hedge economic exposures, based on the Company's assessment of
its net exposure to changes in foreign currency rates. It is management's belief
that such commitments and guarantees will be met without material adverse effect
on the Company's financial position.
 
     The amounts of operating lease obligations due during the five years 1995
through 1999 are $8,200, $8,515, $8,326, $8,346 and $8,421, respectively.
 
     Rental expense for the years 1994, 1993 and 1992 was $9,520, $8,339, and
$8,528, respectively.
 
NOTE 16 -- CONTINGENCIES
 
     The Company and its subsidiaries and related companies are named defendants
in a number of lawsuits and named parties in numerous governmental proceedings
arising in the ordinary course of business.
 
     While the outcome of such contingencies, lawsuits or other proceedings
against the Company cannot be predicted with certainty, management expects that
such liability, to the extent not provided for through insurance or otherwise,
will not have a material adverse effect on the financial statements of the
Company.

NOTE 19 -- SUPPLEMENTARY OIL AND GAS INFORMATION
 
  Reserve estimation -- (Unaudited)
 
     Oil and gas reserves cannot be measured exactly. Reserve estimates are
based on many factors related to reservoir performance which require evaluation
by the engineers interpreting the available data, as well as price, costs and
other economic factors. The reliability of these estimates at any point in time
depends on both the quality and quantity of the technical and economic data, the
production performance of the reservoirs as well as extensive engineering
judgment. Consequently, reserve estimates are subject to revision as additional
data becomes available during the producing life of a reservoir. When a
commercial reservoir is discovered, proved reserves are initially determined
based on only limited data from the first well or wells. Further drilling may
better define the extent of the reservoir and additional production performance,
well tests and engineering studies will likely improve the reliability of the
estimate.
 
     Reserves are considered proved if economic producibility is supported by
either actual production or conclusive formation tests. Proved developed
reserves are reserves that can be expected to be recovered through existing
wells with existing equipment and operating methods. Proved undeveloped reserves
are reserves that are expected to be recovered from new wells on undrilled
acreage or from existing wells where a relatively significant expenditure is
required to permit production. These estimates do not include reserves which may
be found by extension of proved areas or reserves recoverable by secondary or
tertiary recovery methods unless these methods are in operation and showing
successful results.
 
     In 1994, the Company purchased an interest in the undeveloped Britannia
field in the U.K. North Sea, adding at year end 1994 approximately 38 million
barrels of oil equivalent ("boe") to its proved reserves.
 
     In 1992, the Company included in its reported estimates of proved reserves
attributable to its interest in the Indonesian joint venture only those proved
reserves that were committed to be sold under LNG sales contracts or which the
Company expected to be sold in the spot market. Over the past several years, the
Indonesian joint venture experienced better than anticipated field performance
and development drilling successes. Also, Pertamina made progress in marketing
additional LNG volumes that the Company believes will be sold. As a result,
after 1992, the Company booked upward revisions of proved reserves attributable
to its interest in this joint venture.
 
     Information presented for the Company's operations in Indonesia relates to
a production sharing contract between a joint venture group in which the Company
is a member and Pertamina. Debt service relating to the Indonesian facility
which liquefies natural gas supplied by the joint venture and other production
sharing contractors is accounted for by the Company as a cost of production and
operation. The debt obligation is that of Pertamina and not the joint venture.
Such debt service is deducted in estimating future net revenues to be
distributed among Pertamina and the production sharing contractors including the
joint venture and the Company's interest therein. The joint venture has no
ownership interest in the oil and gas reserves but does have the right to share
revenues and/or production and is entitled to recover most field and other
operating costs and capital depreciation. The reserve estimates are subject to
revision as prices fluctuate due to the cost recovery feature under the
production sharing contract and due to the effect that price fluctuations
generally have on reserve estimates. Indonesian reserves associated with the
Unimar partnership are shown under the caption "Non-Consolidated Interests."
 
     "Other International" primarily represents a service contract in Argentina
under which a service fee for each barrel of production was received by Unola
and an interest in Egypt. In January 1992, the Company completed the sale of
Unola.

     The standardized measure data includes estimates of oil and gas reserve
volumes and forecasts of future production rates over the reserve lives.
Estimates of future production expenditures, including taxes and future
development costs, are based on management's best estimate of such costs
assuming a continuation of current economic and operating conditions. No
provision is included for depletion, depreciation and amortization of property
acquisition costs or indirect costs. The sales prices used in the calculation
are the year-end prices of crude oil, including condensate and natural gas
liquids, and natural gas which as of December 31, 1994, were $15.40 per barrel
of U.K. crude oil and $2.47 per Mcf (at the plant inlet) of Indonesian LNG.
Because of the estimated nature of the data presented, changes in price and cost
levels, as well as the timing of future development costs, may have a
significant impact on such data and cause such data not to be representative of
production or cash flows the Company may realize in the future.

                  NOTES TO SUPPLEMENTAL GUARANTOR INFORMATION
 
     (1) In connection with the sale of Notes by UTPH, the following
subsidiaries of UTPH (collectively, the "Guarantors") unconditionally guaranteed
on a joint and several basis UTPH's obligations to pay principal, premium, if
any, and interest with respect to the Notes: Union Texas East Kalimantan Limited
("Kalimantan"), Union Texas Petroleum Energy Corporation ("Energy"), Union Texas
International Corporation ("International"), Union Texas Products Corporation
("Products") and Unistar, Inc. ("Unistar"). Each of the Guarantors is a Delaware
corporation, except that Kalimantan is incorporated under the laws of the
Bahamas, although, the applicable laws of the Bahamas are similar to the laws of
Delaware with respect to the availability of assets to satisfy the obligations
to the Noteholders. Kalimantan and Unistar together own a 37.81% interest in a
joint venture that represents the Company's operations in Indonesia. Products
conducts the Company's domestic hydrocarbon products businesses. International,
a subsidiary of Energy, is a holding company for subsidiaries that conduct the
Company's principal international operations, which include operations in
Indonesia by Kalimantan, a Guarantor, and in the United Kingdom and Pakistan by
two non-Guarantor subsidiaries. Separate financial statements of the Guarantors
of the Notes are not considered to be material to the Noteholders. See Notes 14
and 19 for information describing the Company's operations through the two
Guarantor subsidiaries in Indonesia relating to a production sharing contract as
well as through the non-Guarantor subsidiaries in the United Kingdom, Pakistan
and other international locations.
 
     (2) Investments in subsidiaries are accounted for by the Company on the
cost basis for purposes of the supplemental information. Earnings of
subsidiaries are therefore not reflected in the related investment accounts.
 
     (3) Certain reclassifications were made to conform all of the financial
information to the financial presentation on a consolidated basis. The principal
eliminating entries eliminate investments in subsidiaries, intercompany balances
and intercompany dividends.

                 Period ending on such date and (ii) the remainder (if any) of

         comprising such Borrowing (e.g., a "Euro-Dollar Borrowing" is a
         Borrowing comprised of Euro-Dollar Loans, and a "Sterling Borrowing"
         is a Borrowing comprised of Sterling Loans) or by reference to the
         provisions of Article II under which participation therein is
         determined (i.e., a "Committed Borrowing" is a Borrowing under Section
         2.01 in which all Banks participate in proportion to their
         Commitments, while a "Money Market Borrowing" is a Borrowing under
         Section 2.03 in which the Bank participants are determined on the
         basis of their bids in accordance therewith).

                 1.3.  Section 2.01.  Section 2.01 of the Agreement is hereby
amended to read as follows:

                 SECTION 2.01.  Commitments to Lend.  During the Revolving
         Credit Period each Bank severally agrees, on the terms and conditions
         set forth in this Agreement, to make loans to the Company pursuant to
         this Section 2.01 from time to time in amounts such that the aggregate
         principal amount of Committed Loans by such Bank at any one time
         outstanding to the Company (in the case of Sterling Loans, such
         principal amount being the Current Dollar Amount of such Sterling
         Loans in effect as of such time) shall not exceed the sum of (i) the
         amount of such Bank's Commitment at such time plus (ii) if clause (y)
         of Section





                                      -4-
<PAGE>   5
         2.19(c) is applicable to a particular Borrowing, such Bank's ratable
         (based on the respective Commitments of the Banks) portion of the
         Permitted Excess applicable to such Borrowing; provided that any
         amount added pursuant to this clause (ii) in respect of any particular
         Borrowing shall not be included in any subsequent determination of the
         maximum aggregate principal amount of Committed Loans which such Bank
         is obligated to advance to the Company.  Each Borrowing under this
         Section 2.01 shall be in an aggregate principal amount of $10,000,000
         (or, in the case of Sterling Loans, $10,000,000 in the Current Dollar
         Amounts of such Sterling Loans at the time of such Borrowing or
         5,000,000 pounds sterling, at the option of the Company in its sole 
         discretion) or any larger multiple of $1,000,000 (or, in the case of 
         Sterling Loans, $1,000,000 in the Current Dollar Amounts of such 
         Sterling Loans at the time of such Borrowing or 1,000,000 pounds 
         sterling, as applicable) (except that any such Borrowing may be, 
         subject to the other terms hereof, in the aggregate amount available 
         in accordance with Section 3.02(b)) and shall be made from the
         several Banks ratably in proportion to their respective Commitments, 
         subject in each case to the effects of Section 2.19(c).  Within the 
         foregoing limits, the Company may borrow under this Section 2.01, 
         repay (whether pursuant to Section 2.10 or otherwise), or to the 
         extent permitted by Section 2.11, prepay Loans and reborrow at any 
         time during the Revolving Credit Period under this Section 2.01.

         Sterling Business Day before each Sterling Borrowing, specifying:

                          (i)     the date of such Borrowing, which shall be a
                 Domestic Business Day in the case of a Base Rate Borrowing, a
                 Euro-Dollar Business Day in the case of a Euro-Dollar
                 Borrowing or a Sterling Business Day in the case of a Sterling
                 Borrowing,

                          (ii)    the aggregate amount of such Borrowing,

                          (iii)   whether the Loans comprising such Borrowing
                 are to be Sterling Loans, Base Rate Loans or Euro-Dollar
                 Loans,

                          (iv)    in the case of a Fixed Rate Borrowing, the
                 duration of the initial Interest Period applicable thereto,

                          (v)     if such Interest Period includes (but does
                 not end on) a Commitment Reduction Date and all or part of
                 such Loans are to be repaid on such date to comply with
                 Section 2.10(c), the aggregate amount then to be repaid.

         Notwithstanding the foregoing, not more than twelve Borrowings that
         are either Euro-Dollar Borrowings or Sterling Borrowings shall be
         outstanding at any one time, and any Borrowing which would exceed such
         limitation shall be made as a Base Rate Borrowing.

                 1.5.  Section 2.03(a).  The first sentence of Section 2.03(a)

                 (b)      Not later than 12:00 Noon (London time in the case of
         Sterling Borrowings and Houston time in the case of all other
         Borrowings) on the date of each Borrowing, each Bank participating
         therein shall (except as provided in subsection (c) of this Section
         2.04) make available its share of such Borrowing, (x) in the case of
         all Borrowings other than Sterling Borrowings, in Federal or other
         funds immediately available in Houston, to the Agent at its address
         specified in or pursuant to Section 9.01 in Dollars, and (y) in the
         case of Sterling Borrowings, in funds immediately available in London,
         to the Agent at NationsBank of North Carolina, N.A., New Broad Street
         House, 35 New Broad Street, London, EC2M 1NH England, United Kingdom
         or such other address in London as the Agent may hereafter specify by
         notice to the Company and the Banks, in Sterling.  Unless the Agent
         determines that any applicable condition specified in Article III has
         not been satisfied, the Agent will make the funds so received from the
         Banks available to the Company at the Agent's relevant aforesaid
         address.

                 (c)      If any Bank makes a new Loan hereunder in either
         currency available hereunder (i.e., Dollars or Sterling) to the
         Company on a day on which the Company is to repay all or any part of
         an outstanding Loan in either currency from such Bank, such Bank shall
         apply the proceeds of its new Loan to make such repayment and only an
         amount equal to the difference (if any) between the amount being
         borrowed by the Company (based on the Current Dollar Amount thereof
         then in effect in the case of Sterling Borrowings) and the amount
         being repaid (based on the Current Dollar Amount thereof then in
         effect in the case of Sterling Borrowings) shall be made available by
         such Bank to the Agent in the applicable currency as provided in
         subsection (b), or remitted by the Company to the Agent as provided in
         Section 2.12, as the case may be; provided that in any case in which
         this Section 2.04(c) would apply to the making of a new Loan in one
         currency and a payment of an outstanding Loan in the other currency,
         the Company may, by notice to the Agent given not later than 10:00
         A.M. (Houston time) on the third Sterling Business Day prior to the
         date of such new Loan, elect that this Section 2.04(c) not apply to
         such Loan and payment on such date.

                 (d)      Unless the Agent shall have received notice from a
         Bank prior to the date of any Borrowing that such Bank will not make
         available to the Agent such Bank's share of such Borrowing, the Agent
         may assume that such Bank has made such share available to the Agent
         on the date of such Borrowing in accordance with subsections (b) and
         (c) of this Section 2.04 and the Agent may, in reliance upon such
         assumption, make available to the Company on such date a corresponding
         amount.  If and to the extent that such Bank shall not have so made
         such share available to the Agent, such Bank and the Company severally
         agree to repay to the Agent forthwith on demand such corresponding
         amount together with interest thereon, for each day from the date such
         amount is made available to the Company until the date such amount is
         repaid to the Agent, at (i) in the case of the Company, a rate per
         annum equal to the higher of the Federal





                                      -7-
<PAGE>   8
         Funds Rate and the interest rate applicable thereto pursuant to
         Section 2.07 and (ii) in the case of such Bank, (x) if such Borrowing
         is not a Sterling Borrowing, the Federal Funds Rate, and (y) if such
         Borrowing is a Sterling Borrowing, the higher of (1) the Federal Funds
         Rate and (2) the rate per annum determined by the Agent as being the
         average rate quoted to NationsBank for such day (or, if such day is
         not a Sterling Business Day, for the next preceding Sterling Business
         Day) for overnight transactions in Sterling in London with other
         leading banks.  If such Bank shall repay to the Agent such
         corresponding amount, such amount so repaid shall constitute such
         Bank's Loan included in such Borrowing for purposes of this Agreement.

                 1.11.  Section 2.05(b).  Section 2.05(b) is hereby amended to
read as follows:

                 (b)      Each Bank may, by notice to the Company and the
         Agent, request that its (i) Euro-Dollar Loans and Money Market LIBOR
         Loans, (ii) Base Rate Loans and Money Market Absolute Rate Loans,
         (iii) Sterling Loans or (iv) any combination of the foregoing, payable
         to such Bank (or such lending office, agency or branch of such Bank as
         such Bank may specify in such request) be evidenced by a separate Note
         of the Company.  Each such Note shall be substantially in the form of
         Exhibit A hereto with appropriate modifications to reflect the fact
         that it evidences solely Loans of the relevant grouping.  Any Bank
         that receives multiple Notes through the application of this Section
         2.05(b) agrees that: (1) the aggregate principal amount payable by the
         Company under (A) the Notes issued to such Bank pursuant to this
         Section 2.05(b) plus (B) all other Notes issued to such Bank pursuant
         to this Agreement, shall never exceed the aggregate principal amount
         of the Loans owed to such Bank (including, if applicable, the separate
         lending offices, agencies or branches of such Bank) and (2) the payees
         of the Notes issued at the request of such Bank shall enjoy no greater
         rights (voting or otherwise) than such Bank would enjoy in the absence
         of such request and such payees (including, if applicable, the
         separate lending offices, agencies or branches of such Bank) shall be
         considered a single Bank for purposes of this Agreement.  Each
         reference in this Agreement to the "Note" of such Bank shall be deemed
         to refer to and include any or all such Notes, as the context may
         require.

                 1.12.  Section 2.05(c).  The second sentence in Section
2.05(c) of the Agreement is hereby amended by inserting the phrase ", currency"
after the phrase "shall record the date, amount, maturity".

                 1.13.  Section 2.07.  Section 2.07 of the Agreement is hereby
amended to read as follows:

                 SECTION 2.07.  Interest Rates.  The  Company shall pay
         interest on the unpaid principal amount of each Loan from the date of
         such Loan until such principal amount shall be paid in full, at the
         following rates per annum:

                 (a)      If such Loan is a Base Rate Loan, for each day that
         such Loan is a Base Rate Loan, at a rate per annum equal to the sum of
         (i) the Base Rate for such day plus (ii) at such times as the Margin
         Increase Condition exists and the Additional Margin Increase Condition
         does not exist, 1/8% plus (iii) at such times as the Additional Margin
         Increase Condition exists, 1/4% plus (iv) at such times as any Event
         of Default exists, 1%.  Such interest shall be payable quarterly on
         each March 31, June 30, September 30 and December 31 and on the date
         such Base Rate Loan is Converted or paid in full.  Any overdue
         interest on any Base Rate Loan shall bear interest, payable on demand,
         for each day until paid at a rate per annum equal to the sum of 1%
         plus the otherwise applicable rate for such day.

                 (b)      If such Loan is a Euro-Dollar Loan, at a rate per
         annum equal at all times during any Interest Period for such Loan to
         the sum of (i) 0.575% plus (ii) the applicable London Interbank
         Offered Rate plus (iii) at such times as the Margin Increase Condition
         exists and the Additional Margin Increase Condition does not exist,
         1/8% plus (iv) at such times as the Additional Margin Increase
         Condition exists, 1/4% plus (v) at such times as any Event of Default
         exists, 1%; provided that if any Euro-Dollar Loan or any portion
         thereof shall, as a result of clause (1)(c)(i) of the definition
         herein of "Interest Period", have an Interest Period of less than one
         month, such portion shall bear interest during such Interest Period at
         the rate applicable to Base Rate Loans during such period.  Such
         interest shall be payable for each Interest Period on the last day
         thereof and, if such Interest Period is longer than three months, at
         intervals of three months after the first day thereof.

                 The "London Interbank Offered Rate" applicable to any Interest
         Period means the arithmetic average (rounded upward, if necessary, to
         the next higher 1/16 of 1%) of the respective rates per annum at which
         deposits in Dollars are offered to each of the Reference Banks in the
         London interbank market at approximately 11:00 A.M. (London time) two
         Euro-Dollar Business Days before the first day of such Interest Period
         in an amount approximately equal to the principal amount in Dollars of
         the Euro-Dollar Loan of such Reference Bank to which such Interest
         Period is to apply and for a period of time comparable to such
         Interest Period.

                 (c)      If such Loan is a Sterling Loan, at a rate per annum
         equal at all times during any Interest Period for such Loan to the sum
         of (i) 0.575% plus (ii) the applicable Sterling Interbank Offered Rate
         plus (iii) at such times as the Margin Increase Condition exists and
         the Additional Margin Increase Condition does not exist, 1/8% plus
         (iv) at such times as the Additional Margin Increase





                                      -9-
<PAGE>   10
         Condition exists, 1/4% plus (v) at such times as any Event of Default
         exists, 1%; provided that if any Sterling Loan or any portion thereof
         shall, as a result of clause (4)(c)(i) of the definition herein of
         "Interest Period", have an Interest Period of less than one month,
         such portion shall bear interest during such Interest Period at the
         rate otherwise applicable to such Sterling Loans during such period
         plus 1/2%.  Such interest shall be payable for each Interest Period on
         the last day thereof and, if such Interest Period is longer than three
         months, at intervals of three months after the first day thereof.

                 The "Sterling Interbank Offered Rate" applicable to any
         Interest Period means the arithmetic average (rounded upward, if
         necessary, to the next higher 1/16 of 1%) of the respective rates per
         annum at which deposits in Sterling are offered to each of the
         Reference Banks in the London interbank market at approximately 11:00
         A.M. (London time) two Sterling Business Days before the first day of
         such Interest Period in an amount approximately equal to the principal
         amount in Sterling of the Sterling Loan of such Reference Bank to
         which such Interest Period is to apply and for a period of time
         comparable to such Interest Period.

                 (d)      Any overdue principal of or interest on any
         Euro-Dollar Loan shall bear interest, payable on demand, for each day
         from and including the date payment thereof was due to but excluding
         the date of actual payment, at a rate per annum equal to the sum of 1%
         plus the higher of (i) the sum of 0.575% plus the London Interbank
         Offered Rate applicable to such Loan plus at such times as the Margin
         Increase Condition exists and the Additional Margin Increase Condition
         does not exist, 1/8% plus at such times as the Additional Margin
         Increase Condition exists, 1/4% and (ii) the sum of (1) 0.575% plus
         (2) the average (rounded upward, if necessary, to the next higher 1/16
         of 1%) of the respective rates per annum at which one day (or, if such
         amount due remains unpaid more than three Euro-Dollar Business Days,
         then for such other period of time not longer than three months as the
         Agent may select) deposits in Dollars in an amount approximately equal
         to such overdue payment due to each of the Reference Banks are offered
         to such Reference Bank in the London interbank market for the
         applicable period determined as provided above plus (3) at such times
         as the Margin Increase Condition exists and the Additional Margin
         Increase Condition does not exist, 1/8% plus (4) at such times as the
         Additional Margin Increase Condition exists, 1/4% (or, if the
         circumstances described in clause (i) or (ii) of Section 8.01(a) shall
         exist, at a rate per annum equal to the sum of 1% plus the rate
         applicable to Base Rate Loans for such day).

                 (e)      Any overdue principal of or interest on any Sterling
         Loan shall bear interest, payable on demand, for each day from and
         including the date payment thereof was due to but excluding the date
         of actual payment, at a rate per annum equal to the sum of 1% plus the

         does not exist, 1/8% plus at such times as the Additional Margin
         Increase Condition exists, 1/4% and (ii) the sum of (1) 0.575% plus
         (2) the average (rounded upward, if necessary, to the next higher 1/16
         of 1%) of the respective rates per annum at which one day (or, if such
         amount due remains unpaid more than three Sterling Business Days, then
         for such other period of time not longer than three months as the
         Agent may select) deposits in Sterling in an amount approximately
         equal to such overdue payment due to each of the Reference Banks are
         offered to such Reference Bank in the London interbank market for the
         applicable period determined as provided above plus (3) at such times
         as the Margin Increase Condition exists and the Additional Margin
         Increase Condition does not exist, 1/8% plus (4) at such times as the
         Additional Margin Increase Condition exists, 1/4% (or, if the
         circumstances described in clause (i) or (ii) of Section 8.01(b) shall
         exist, at a rate per annum equal to the sum of 1% plus the rate
         applicable to Base Rate Loans for such day).

                 (f)      Subject to Section 8.01(a), each Money Market LIBOR
         Loan shall bear interest on the outstanding principal amount thereof,
         for the Interest Period applicable thereto, at a rate per annum equal
         to the sum of the London Interbank Offered Rate for such Interest
         Period (determined in accordance with Section 2.07(b) as if the
         related Money Market LIBOR Borrowing were a Committed Euro-Dollar
         Borrowing) plus (or minus) the Money Market Margin quoted by the Bank
         making such Loan in accordance with Section 2.03 plus, at such times
         as any Event of Default exists, 1%.  Each Money Market Absolute Rate
         Loan shall bear interest on the outstanding principal amount thereof,
         for the Interest Period applicable thereto, at a rate per annum equal
         to the Money Market Absolute Rate quoted by the Bank making such Loan
         in accordance with Section 2.03 plus, at such times as any Event of
         Default exists, 1%.  Such interest shall be payable for each Interest
         Period on the last day thereof and, if such Interest Period is longer
         than three months, at intervals of three months after the first day
         thereof.  Any overdue principal of or interest on any Money Market
         Loan shall bear interest, payable on demand, for each day until paid
         at a rate per annum equal to the sum of 1% plus the Base Rate for such
         day.

                 (g)      The Agent shall determine each interest rate
         applicable to the Loans hereunder.  The Agent shall give prompt notice
         to the Company and the participating Banks of each rate of interest so
         determined, and its determination thereof shall be conclusive in the
         absence of manifest error.  Upon request of the Company, the Agent
         shall furnish to it such information as to its determinations
         hereunder as the Company may reasonably request.

                 (h)      Each Reference Bank agrees to use its best efforts to
         furnish quotations to the Agent as contemplated by this Section 2.07.
         If any Reference Bank does not furnish a timely quotation, the Agent
         shall determine the relevant interest rate on the basis of the
         quotation or quotations furnished by the remaining





                                      -11-

         Reference Bank or Banks or, if none of such quotations is available on
         a timely basis, the provisions of Section 8.01 shall apply.

                 (i)      This Section 2.07 and each other provision in any of
         the Financing Documents or in any other agreement executed in
         connection herewith are specifically made subject to Section 2.16.

                 1.14.  Section 2.08(a).  The first sentence of Section 2.08(a)
of the Agreement is hereby amended by inserting the parenthetical "(in the case
of Sterling Loans, based on the Current Dollar Amounts thereof from time to
time during such period)" immediately prior to the period at the end thereof.

                 1.15.  Section 2.08(b).  The last sentence of Section 2.08(b)
of the Agreement is hereby amended by inserting the parenthetical "(in the case
of Sterling Loans, based on the Current Dollar Amounts thereof from time to
time during such period)" immediately before the period at the end thereof.

                 1.16.  Section 2.09.  Section 2.09 of the Agreement is hereby
amended by inserting the parenthetical "(in the case of Sterling Loans, such
principal amount being the Current Dollar Amount thereof then in effect)"
immediately before the period at the end thereof.

                 1.17.  Section 2.10.  Section 2.10 of the Agreement is hereby
amended to read as follows:

                 SECTION 2.10.  Mandatory Termination or Reduction of
         Commitments; Mandatory Prepayments.  (a)  The Commitments shall
         terminate on the Termination Date and any Loans then outstanding
         (together with accrued interest thereon) shall be due and payable on
         such date.

                 (b)      The Commitment of each Bank shall be automatically
         reduced, on each Commitment Reduction Date, to an amount equal to such
         Bank's ratable share of (i) the amount of maximum aggregate
         Commitments set forth in Schedule I with respect to such Commitment
         Reduction Date minus (ii) the aggregate amount of all reductions of
         the Commitments pursuant to Section 2.09 or Section 2.10(d) applicable
         to such Commitment Reduction Date pursuant to the following sentence.
         Each reduction of the Commitments pursuant to Section 2.09 or Section
         2.10(d) shall be applied to reduce each amount set forth on Schedule I
         for each subsequent Commitment Reduction Date by an amount equal to
         the amount of such reduction divided by the number of Commitment
         Reduction Dates to occur on or after the date such reduction is
         effective.

                 (c)      On each Commitment Reduction Date, the Company shall
         be obligated to repay such principal amount (together with accrued
         interest thereon) of each Bank's outstanding Committed Loans, if any,
         as may be necessary so that after such repayment the aggregate
         outstanding principal amount of such Bank's





                                      -12-
<PAGE>   13
         Committed Loans (in the case of Sterling Loans, such principal amount
         being the Current Dollar Amounts of such Sterling Loans in effect on
         such Commitment Reduction Date) does not exceed the amount of such
         Bank's Commitment as then reduced.  Whenever the Interest Period
         specified in a Notice of Committed Borrowing includes (but does not
         end on) a Commitment Reduction Date on which a payment of Committed
         Loans will be required under this subsection (c), the Company shall
         consider whether it wishes to repay on such Commitment Reduction Date
         all or part of the Borrowing to be made pursuant to such Notice of
         Committed Borrowing and, if so, shall specify the aggregate amount so
         to be repaid in such Notice of Committed Borrowing.  If the Company
         fails so to select the Committed Borrowing to be repaid on any
         Commitment Reduction Date, such Committed Borrowing shall be selected
         by the Agent.

                 (d)      On the fifth Domestic Business Day following any
         Asset Sale that results in positive Excess Net Sales Proceeds, (i) the
         Company will deliver to each of the Banks a certificate of the chief
         financial officer, the chief accounting officer or the treasurer of
         the Company certifying the amount of such Excess Net Sales Proceeds
         from such Asset Sale, (ii) the Commitments shall be automatically
         reduced ratably by an amount equal to 100% of the amount of such
         Excess Net Sales Proceeds from such Asset Sale, (iii) the Company
         shall be obligated to repay such principal amount (together with
         accrued interest thereon) of each Bank's outstanding Committed Loans,
         if any, as may be necessary so that after such repayment the aggregate
         outstanding principal amount of such Bank's Committed Loans (in the
         case of Sterling Loans, such principal amount being the Current Dollar
         Amounts of such Sterling Loans in effect on the date of such
         reduction) does not exceed the amount of such Bank's Commitment as
         then reduced.

                 (e)      If, on any Adjustment Date, either (i) the aggregate
         outstanding principal amount of any Bank's Committed Loans (in the
         case of Sterling Loans, such principal amount being the Current Dollar
         Amounts of such Sterling Loans in effect on such Adjustment Date)
         exceeds the amount of such Bank's Commitment or (ii) the aggregate
         outstanding principal amount of all Loans (in the case of Sterling
         Loans, such principal amount being the Current Dollar Amounts of such
         Sterling Loans in effect on such Adjustment Date) exceeds the
         aggregate amount of the Commitments, then on such Adjustment Date, the
         Company shall be obligated to repay such principal amount (together
         with accrued interest thereon) of each Bank's outstanding Committed
         Loans as may be necessary so that after such repayment (x) the
         aggregate outstanding principal amount of each Bank's Committed Loans
         (in the case of Sterling Loans, such principal amount being the
         Current Dollar Amounts of such Sterling Loans in effect on such
         Adjustment Date) does not exceed the amount of such Bank's Commitment
         on such Adjustment Date, and (y) the aggregate outstanding principal
         amount of all Loans (in the case of Sterling Loans, such principal
         amount being the Current Dollar Amounts of such Sterling Loans in
         effect on such Adjustment Date) does not exceed the aggregate amount
         of the





                                      -13-
<PAGE>   14
         Commitments; provided that if the aggregate payment that is required
         to be made pursuant to this Section 2.10(e) on any Adjustment Date
         (other than any Adjustment Date referred to in clause (iii) of the
         definition herein of "Adjustment Date") is less than $1,000,000, then
         the Company shall not be required to make such payment on such
         Adjustment Date pursuant to this Section 2.10(e).

                 1.18.  Section 2.11(a).  Section 2.11(a) of the Agreement is
hereby amended to read as follows:

                 (a)      The Company may, upon at least one Domestic Business
         Day's (or in the case of prepayments on any Sterling Borrowing, three
         Sterling Business Days') notice to the Agent, prepay any Borrowing in
         whole at any time, or from time to time in part in amounts aggregating
         $10,000,000 (or, in the case of Sterling Borrowings, $10,000,000 in
         the Current Dollar Amounts of such Sterling Loans then in effect or
         5,000,000 pounds sterling, at the option of the Company in its sole 
         discretion) or any larger multiple of $1,000,000 (or, in the case of 
         Sterling Borrowings, $1,000,000 in the Current Dollar Amounts of such 
         Sterling Loans then in effect or 1,000,000 pounds sterling, as 
         applicable), by paying the principal amount to be prepaid together 
         with accrued interest thereon to the date of prepayment; provided 
         that no partial prepayment of a Sterling Borrowing, a Euro-Dollar 
         Borrowing or a Money Market Borrowing shall be made if after giving 
         effect thereto the principal amount of such Borrowing would be less 
         than $10,000,000 (or, in the case of Sterling Borrowings, the lesser 
         of $10,000,000 in the Current Dollar Amounts of such Sterling Loans 
         then in effect and 5,000,000 pounds sterling).  Each such optional 
         prepayment shall be applied to prepay ratably the Loans of the 
         several Banks included in such Borrowing.

                 1.19.  Section 2.12.  Section 2.12 of the Agreement is hereby
amended to read as follows:

                 SECTION 2.12.  General Provisions as to Payments.  (a) The
         Company shall make each payment of principal of, and interest on, the
         Loans and of fees hereunder, not later than 12:00 Noon (London time in
         the case of Sterling Loans and Houston time in the case of all other
         Loans and fees) on the date when due, (i) in the case of fees and all
         Loans other than Sterling Loans, in Federal or other funds immediately
         available in Houston, to the Agent at its address referred to in
         Section 9.01, in Dollars, and (ii) in the case of Sterling Loans, in
         funds immediately available in London, to the Agent at its address
         referred to in Section 2.04(b), in Sterling.  The Agent will promptly
         distribute to each Bank its ratable share of each such payment
         received by the Agent for the account of the Banks.  Whenever any
         payment of principal of, or interest on, the Base Rate Loans or of
         fees shall be due on a day which is not a Domestic Business Day, the
         date for payment thereof shall be extended to the next succeeding
         Domestic Business Day.  Whenever any payment of principal of, or
         interest on, the Euro-Dollar Loans shall be due on a day which is not
         a Euro-Dollar Business Day, the date for payment thereof shall be
         extended to the next succeeding Euro-Dollar Business Day unless





                                      -14-
<PAGE>   15
         such Euro-Dollar Business Day falls in another calendar month, in
         which case the date for payment thereof shall be the next preceding
         Euro-Dollar Business Day.  Whenever any payment of principal of, or
         interest on, the Money Market Loans shall be due on a day which is not
         a Euro-Dollar Business Day, the date for payment thereof shall be
         extended to the next succeeding Euro-Dollar Business Day.  Whenever
         any payment of principal of, or interest on, the Sterling Loans shall
         be due on a day which is not a Sterling Business Day, the date for
         payment thereof shall be extended to the next succeeding Sterling
         Business Day unless such Sterling Business Day falls in another
         calendar month, in which case the date for payment thereof shall be
         the next preceding Sterling Business Day.  If the date for any payment
         of principal is extended by operation of law or otherwise, interest
         thereon shall be payable for such extended time.

                 (b)      Unless the Agent shall have received notice from the
         Company prior to the date on which any payment is due from the Company
         to the Banks hereunder that the Company will not make such payment in
         full, the Agent may assume that the Company has made such payment in
         full to the Agent on such date and the Agent may, in reliance upon
         such assumption, cause to be distributed to each Bank on such due date
         an amount equal to the amount then due such Bank.  If and to the
         extent that the Company shall not have so made such payment, each Bank
         shall repay to the Agent forthwith on demand such amount distributed
         to such Bank together with interest thereon, for each day from the
         date such amount is distributed to such Bank until the date such Bank
         repays such amount to the Agent, at (i) if such amount was distributed
         in Dollars, the Federal Funds Rate, and (ii) if such amount was
         distributed in Sterling, the higher of (x) the Federal Funds Rate and
         (y) the rate per annum determined by the Agent as being the average
         rate quoted to NationsBank for such day (or, if such day is not a
         Sterling Business Day, for the next preceding Sterling Business Day)
         for overnight transactions in Sterling in London with other leading
         banks.

                 (c)      At the time of each payment of principal of any Loan,
         the Company shall specify, by notice to the Agent, the Loans to which
         such payment shall be applied.  If the Company fails to so specify,
         the Agent shall apply such payment first to such Committed Loans as
         the Agent may select and, after payment in full of the Committed
         Loans, to such other Loans as the Agent may select.

                 1.20.  Section 2.13.  Section 2.13 of the Agreement is hereby
amended to read as follows:

                 SECTION 2.13.  Funding Losses.  If any Obligor makes any
         payment of principal with respect to any Fixed Rate Loan (pursuant to
         Article II, VI or VIII or otherwise) on any day other than the last
         day of the Interest Period applicable thereto, or the end of an
         applicable period fixed pursuant to Section 2.07(d) or Section
         2.07(e), or if the Company fails to borrow any Fixed Rate Loans after
         notice has been given to any Bank in accordance with Section 2.04(a),
         or if any





                                      -15-
<PAGE>   16
         Conversion of any Euro-Dollar Loan or Sterling Loan occurs on any day
         other than the last day of an Interest Period applicable thereto or
         fails to occur as contemplated herein, the Company shall reimburse
         each Bank within 15 days after demand for any resulting loss or
         expense incurred by it (or by an existing or prospective Participant
         in the related Loan), including (without limitation) any loss incurred
         in obtaining, liquidating or employing deposits from third parties,
         but excluding loss of margin from the period after any such payment or
         failure to borrow and, in the case of any such payment or Conversion
         occurring on a day other than the last day of the applicable Interest
         Period, losses resulting from currency fluctuations after such payment
         or such Conversion; provided that such Bank shall have delivered to
         the Company a certificate as to the amount of such loss or expense,
         which certificate shall be conclusive in the absence of manifest
         error; provided further that, the Company shall not be required to
         reimburse a Bank for any such loss or expense resulting from the
         failure of a Conversion to occur if such failure is the fault of such
         Bank.

                 1.21.  Section 2.18.  Section 2.18 of the Agreement is hereby
amended to read as follows:

                 SECTION 2.18.  Conversions.  (a)  The Company may on any
         Sterling Business Day, upon notice given to the Agent no later than
         10:00 a.m. (Houston time) on the third Sterling Business Day prior to
         the date of the proposed Conversion and subject to the provisions of
         Section 2.02 and Article VIII and the other provisions hereof, Convert
         all Committed Loans comprising one or more Borrowings; provided, that
         (i) Loans comprising a Borrowing may not be Converted if after giving
         effect to such Conversion, such Borrowing would be (A) a Euro-Dollar
         Borrowing and the outstanding principal amount of such Borrowing would
         be less than $10,000,000 or (B) a Sterling Borrowing and the
         outstanding principal amount of such Sterling Borrowing would be less
         than the lesser of 5,000,000 pounds sterling and $10,000,000 (based 
         on the Current Dollar Amount of the Sterling Loans comprising such 
         Sterling Borrowing then in effect), and (ii) no Conversion (other 
         than changing Euro-Dollar Loans or Sterling Loans into Base Rate 
         Loans) may be made if any Event of Default is then existing.  Each 
         such notice of a Conversion shall, within the restrictions specified 
         above, specify (i) the date of such Conversion, (ii) the Loans to be 
         Converted, (iii) if after giving effect to such Conversion, such 
         Borrowing would be a Euro-Dollar Borrowing or a Sterling Borrowing, 
         the commencement date and duration of the proposed Interest Period 
         for each Loan comprising such Borrowing, and (iv) the nature of such 
         Conversion (i.e., whether such Conversion is a change of Committed 
         Loans of one Type into another Type, a continuation of Euro-Dollar 
         Loans or Sterling Loans as such for an additional Interest Period or 
         an election to change an Interest Period).  Each such notice shall 
         be irrevocable.

                 (b)      If the aggregate unpaid principal amount of
         Euro-Dollar Loans comprising any Borrowing shall be reduced by payment
         or prepayment or





                                      -16-
<PAGE>   17
         otherwise, to less than $10,000,000, such Loans shall automatically,
         on the last day of the then existing Interest Period therefor, Convert
         into Base Rate Loans.

                 (c)      If the Company shall fail (whether as a result of the
         proviso to the first sentence of Section 2.18(a) or otherwise) to
         select the duration of any Interest Period for any Euro-Dollar Loans
         or Sterling Loans in accordance with the provisions contained in the
         definition herein of "Interest Period", or if there shall be any Event
         of Default, such Loans will automatically on the last day of the then
         existing Interest Period therefor, Convert into Base Rate Loans.

                 1.22.  Section 2.19.  Article II of the Agreement is hereby
further amended by inserting at the end thereof a new Section 2.19 to read as
follows:

                 SECTION 2.19   Sterling Loans.  (a) At or before 11:00 A.M.
         (London time) two Sterling Business Days before each Adjustment Date
         or as soon thereafter as practicable, each Reference Bank agrees to
         use its best efforts to furnish to the Agent the information
         contemplated by the definition herein of "Current Exchange Rate".
         Promptly thereafter and in any event by 4:00 P.M. (London time) or as
         soon thereafter as practicable (subject to the last sentence of this
         Section 2.19(a)), the Agent shall determine the Current Exchange Rate
         and the Current Dollar Amount of each Sterling Loan.  All
         determinations of any Current Exchange Rate or any Current Dollar
         Amount from time to time shall be made by the Agent, which
         determinations shall be conclusive in the absence of manifest error,
         and the Agent shall give prompt notice to the Banks and the Company of
         each such determination.  If any Reference Bank does not furnish a
         timely quotation, the Agent shall determine the relevant Current
         Exchange Rate and Current Dollar Amounts on the basis of the
         information furnished by the remaining Reference Bank or Banks or, if
         no such information is available on a timely basis, the then existing
         Current Exchange Rate shall continue to apply and the provisions of
         Section 8.01(b) shall apply.

                 (b)      The Company expressly agrees that all payments of
         principal of and interest on Sterling Loans shall be made in Sterling.

                 (c)      If (i) on any date on which a Notice of Committed
         Borrowing or notice of Conversion is given by the Company to the
         Agent, the aggregate outstanding principal amount of the Loans plus
         the principal amount of any new Borrowing (in the case of outstanding
         Sterling Loans and in the case of any new Sterling Borrowing, such
         principal amounts being the Current Dollar Amounts thereof as of the
         date such notice is given) would not exceed the aggregate amount of
         the Commitments, and (ii) upon recalculation of the Current Dollar
         Amounts prior to such new Borrowing or Conversion, as the case may be,
         as contemplated by Section 2.19(a) and the relevant definitions
         herein, the aggregate outstanding principal amount of the Loans plus
         the principal amount of any new Borrowing (in the case of outstanding
         Sterling Loans and in the case of any new Sterling Borrowing, such
         principal amounts being the Current Dollar Amounts thereof

         immediately following such recalculation) would exceed the aggregate
         amount of the Commitments, then (x) if such excess is equal to or
         greater than $1,000,000, the requested amount of such new Borrowing or
         Conversion shall be deemed to be decreased by the amount of such
         excess (with such decrease being applied to each of the Banks ratably
         based on their respective Commitments), and (y) if such excess is less
         than $1,000,000, the requested amount of such new Borrowing or
         Conversion shall not be decreased and such excess shall be a
         "Permitted Excess" applicable to such Sterling Borrowing.

                 1.23.  Section 3.02(b).  Section 3.02(b) of the Agreement is
hereby amended to read as follows:

                 (b)      the fact that, immediately after such Borrowing, the
         aggregate outstanding principal amount of the Loans (in the case of
         Sterling Loans, such principal amount being the Current Dollar Amounts
         of such Sterling Loans in effect as of the date of such Borrowing)
         will not exceed the aggregate amount of the Commitments plus the
         Permitted Excess, if any, applicable to such Borrowing in accordance
         with Section 2.19(c);

                 1.24.  Section 6.01.  Section 6.01 of the Agreement is hereby
amended by inserting the parenthetical "(in the case of Sterling Loans, such
principal amount being the Current Dollar Amounts of such Sterling Loans then
in effect)" after the phrase "at least 51% in aggregate principal amount of the
Loans" in clause (ii) thereof.

                 1.25.  Section 8.01.  Section 8.01 of the Agreement is hereby
amended to read as follows:

                 Section 8.01.  Basis for Determining Interest Rate Inadequate
         or Unfair.  (a) If on or prior to the first day of any of any Interest
         Period (unless such Interest Period is an Interest Period for Sterling
         Loans):

                          (i)     the Agent is advised by the Reference Banks
                 that deposits in Dollars (in the applicable amounts) are not
                 being offered to the Reference Banks in the relevant market
                 for such Interest Period, or

                          (ii)    in the case of a Committed Borrowing, Banks
                 having 50% or more of the aggregate amount of the Commitments
                 advise the Agent that the London Interbank Offered Rate as
                 determined by the Agent will not adequately and fairly reflect
                 the cost to such Banks of funding their Euro-Dollar Loans for
                 such Interest Period,

         the Agent shall forthwith give notice thereof to the Company and the
         Banks, whereupon until the Agent notifies the Company that the
         circumstances giving rise to such suspension no longer exist, (1) the
         obligations of the Banks to make Euro-Dollar Loans, or make any
         Conversion that results in any Loan becoming or remaining a
         Euro-Dollar Loan, shall be suspended, and (2) unless the Company





                                      -18-
<PAGE>   19
         notifies the Agent before 10:00 A.M. (Houston time) on the date of any
         Fixed Rate Borrowing for which a Notice of Borrowing has previously
         been given that it elects not to borrow on such date, (x) if such
         Fixed Rate Borrowing is a Euro-Dollar Borrowing, such Borrowing shall
         instead be made as a Base Rate Borrowing and (y) if such Fixed Rate
         Borrowing is a Money Market LIBOR Borrowing, the Money Market LIBOR
         Loans comprising such Borrowing shall bear interest for each day from
         and including the first day to but excluding the last day of the
         Interest Period applicable thereto at the sum of the Base Rate for
         such day plus at such times as the Margin Increase Condition exists
         and the Additional Margin Increase Condition does not exist, 1/8% plus
         at such times as the Additional Margin Increase Condition exists, 1/4%
         plus at such times as any Event of Default exists, 1%.

                 (b) If on or prior to the first day of any Interest Period for
         any Sterling Loan:

                          (i)     the Agent is advised by the Reference Banks
                 that deposits in Sterling (in the applicable amounts) are not
                 being offered to the Reference Banks in the relevant market
                 for such Interest Period, or

                          (ii)    Banks having 50% or more of the aggregate
                 amount of the Commitments advise the Agent that the Sterling
                 Interbank Offered Rate as determined by the Agent will not
                 adequately and fairly reflect the cost to such Banks of
                 funding their Sterling Loans for such Interest Period, or

                          (iii)   any Bank advises the Agent that such Bank
                 reasonably believes that having its Sterling Loan outstanding
                 for such Interest Period could reasonably be expected to
                 result in a reduction in interest payable to such Bank
                 pursuant to Section 2.16(a) or 2.16(b), or

                          (iv)    none of the Reference Banks furnishes the
                 Agent with the information contemplated by Section 2.19(a) or
                 Banks having 50% or more of the aggregate amount of the
                 Commitments advise the Agent that Sterling is not freely
                 convertible and freely transferable into Dollars or that
                 Dollars are not freely convertible and freely transferable
                 into Sterling,

         the Agent shall forthwith give notice thereof to the Company and the
         Banks, whereupon until the Agent notifies the Company that the
         circumstances giving rise to such suspension no longer exist:

         (1)     the obligations of the Banks to make new Sterling Loans, or
                 make any Conversion that results in any Loan (other than an
                 existing Sterling Loan) becoming a Sterling Loan, shall be
                 suspended and (A) unless the Company notifies the Agent before
                 10:00 A.M. (Houston time) on the date specified for any new
                 Sterling Borrowing for which a Notice of Borrowing has
                 previously been given, that it elects not to borrow on such
                 date, such

<PAGE>   20
                 Sterling Borrowing shall instead be made as a Base Rate
                 Borrowing (based on the Current Dollar Amount of such Sterling
                 Borrowing, but subject to the provisions and limitations
                 applicable to all Base Rate Borrowings set forth herein), and
                 (B) unless the Company notifies the Agent before 10:00 A.M.
                 (Houston time) on the date specified for any Conversion of a
                 Loan (other than an existing Loan) into a Sterling Loan for
                 which a notice of Conversion has previously been given, that
                 it elects not to Convert such Loan on such date, such Loan
                 shall be Converted into a Base Rate Loan;

         (2)     in the event that any of the circumstances referred to in
                 paragraphs (i), (ii) or (iii) exist but none of the
                 circumstances referred to in paragraph (iv) exists, the
                 obligations of the Banks to make any Conversion that results
                 in any Sterling Loan remaining a Sterling Loan shall be
                 suspended;

         (3)     in the event that any of the circumstances referred to in
                 paragraph (iv) exist but none of the circumstances referred to
                 in paragraphs (i), (ii) or (iii) exist, each existing Sterling
                 Loan shall be Converted on the last day of each Interest
                 Period therefor by continuing such Sterling Loan for
                 additional one month Interest Period(s) until such time as the
                 circumstances causing such suspension no longer exist; and

         (4)     in the event that any of the circumstances referred to in
                 paragraph (iv) exist and any of the circumstances referred to
                 in paragraph (i), (ii) or (iii) exist, each existing Sterling
                 Loan shall continue as a Sterling Loan but shall bear interest
                 at (a) a rate per annum to be agreed upon by the Company and
                 the Required Banks, acting reasonably and in good faith with a
                 view to agreeing to an interest rate that is the economic
                 equivalent of the interest rate that would have applied (for
                 successive one month Interest Period(s) until such time as the
                 circumstances causing such suspension no longer exist) had
                 such event not existed, or (b) in the absence of such
                 agreement referred to in the preceding clause (a), at the rate
                 applicable to such Sterling Loan prior to such event.

                 1.26.  Section 8.02.  Section 8.02 of the Agreement is hereby
amended to read as follows:

                 Section 8.02.  Illegality.  (a) If, after (x) the date of this
         Agreement, in the case of any Euro-Dollar Loan or (y) the date of the
         related Money Market Quote, in the case of any Money Market LIBOR
         Loan, the adoption of any applicable law, rule or regulation, or any
         change therein, or any change in the interpretation or administration
         thereof by any governmental authority, central bank or comparable
         agency charged with the interpretation or administration thereof, or
         compliance by any Bank (or its Euro-Dollar Lending Office) with any
         request or directive (whether or not having the force of law) of any
         such authority, central bank or comparable agency shall make it
         unlawful or impossible for any Bank (or its Euro-Dollar Lending
         Office) to make, maintain or fund its Euro-Dollar Loans





                                      -20-
<PAGE>   21
         or Money Market LIBOR Loans, as the case may be, or make any
         Conversion that results in any Loan becoming or remaining a
         Euro-Dollar Loan, and such Bank shall so notify the Agent, the Agent
         shall forthwith give notice thereof to the other Banks and the
         Company, whereupon until such Bank notifies the Company and the Agent
         that the circumstances giving rise to such suspension no longer exist,
         the obligation of such Bank to make Euro-Dollar Loans, or make any
         Conversion that results in any Loan becoming or remaining a
         Euro-Dollar Loan, or make Money Market LIBOR Loans, as the case may
         be, shall be suspended.  Before giving any notice to the Agent
         pursuant to this Section 8.02(a), such Bank shall designate a
         different Euro-Dollar Lending Office if such designation will avoid
         the need for giving such notice and will not, in the judgment of such
         Bank, be otherwise disadvantageous to such Bank.  If such Bank shall
         determine that it may not lawfully continue to maintain and fund any
         of its outstanding Euro-Dollar Loans or Money Market LIBOR Loans, as
         the case may be, to maturity and shall so specify in such notice, the
         Company shall immediately prepay in full the then outstanding
         principal amount of each such Euro-Dollar Loan or Money Market LIBOR
         Loan, as the case may be, of such Bank, together with accrued interest
         thereon.  Concurrently with prepaying each such Euro-Dollar Loan, the
         Company shall borrow a Base Rate Loan in an equal principal amount
         from such Bank (on which interest and principal shall be payable
         contemporaneously with the related Euro-Dollar Loans of the other
         Banks), and such Bank shall make such a Base Rate Loan.

                 (b) If, after the date of this Agreement, the adoption of any
         applicable law, rule or regulation, or any change therein, or any
         change in the interpretation or administration thereof by any
         governmental authority, central bank or comparable agency charged with
         the interpretation or administration thereof, or compliance by any
         Bank (or its Sterling Lending Office) with any request or directive
         (whether or not having the force of law) of any such authority,
         central bank or comparable agency shall make it unlawful or impossible
         for any Bank (or its Sterling Lending Office) to make, maintain or
         fund its Sterling Loans or make any Conversion that results in any
         Loan becoming or remaining a Sterling Loan, and such Bank shall so
         notify the Agent, the Agent shall forthwith give notice thereof to the
         other Banks and the Company, whereupon until such Bank notifies the
         Company and the Agent that the circumstances giving rise to such
         suspension no longer exist, the obligation of such Bank to make
         Sterling Loans, or make any Conversion that results in any Loan
         becoming or remaining a Sterling Loan, as the case may be, shall be
         suspended.  Before giving any notice to the Agent pursuant to this
         Section 8.02(b), such Bank shall designate a different Sterling
         Lending Office if such designation will avoid the need for giving such
         notice and will not, in the judgment of such Bank, be otherwise
         disadvantageous to such Bank.  If such Bank shall determine that it
         may not lawfully continue to maintain and fund any of its outstanding
         Sterling Loans to maturity and shall so specify in such notice, the
         Company shall immediately prepay in full the then outstanding
         principal amount of each such Sterling Loan of such Bank together with
         accrued interest thereon.  Concurrently with prepaying each such
         Sterling Loan, the





                                      -21-

         Company shall borrow a Base Rate Loan, and such Bank shall make such
         Base Rate Loan, in the principal amount equal to the Current Dollar
         Amount of such Sterling Loan from such Bank (on which interest and
         principal shall be payable contemporaneously with the related Sterling
         Loans of the other Banks) (or, if making such Base Rate Loan in such
         amount would result in (x) the aggregate outstanding principal amount
         of such Bank's Committed Loans (in the case of any remaining Sterling
         Loans, such principal amount being the Current Dollar Amounts of such
         remaining Sterling Loans then in effect) exceeding the amount of such
         Bank's Commitment then in effect, or (y) the aggregate outstanding
         principal amount of all Loans (in the case of any remaining Sterling
         Loans, such principal amount being the Current Dollar Amounts of such
         remaining Sterling Loans then in effect) exceeding the aggregate
         amount of the Commitments, in such lesser principal amount so that no
         such excess referred to in clause (x) or (y) would so result).

                 1.27.  Section 8.04.  Section 8.04 of the Agreement is hereby
amended to read as follows:

                 Section 8.04. Base Rate Loans Substituted for Affected Fixed
         Rate Loans.  If (i) the obligation of any Bank to make Euro-Dollar
         Loans or Sterling Loans to the Company has been suspended pursuant to
         Section 8.02 or (ii) any Bank has demanded compensation under Section
         8.03(a) in respect of Euro-Dollar Loans or Sterling Loans and the
         Company shall, by at least five Euro-Dollar Business Days' prior
         notice to such Bank through the Agent, have elected that the
         provisions of this Section 8.04 shall apply to such Bank, then, unless
         and until such Bank notifies the Company that the circumstances giving
         rise to such suspension or demand for compensation no longer apply:

                          (a)     all Loans to the Company which would
                 otherwise be made by such Bank as, or be Converted by such
                 Bank as or into, Euro-Dollar Loans or Sterling Loans, as the
                 case may be, shall instead be made as, or Converted into, Base
                 Rate Loans (on which interest and principal shall be payable
                 contemporaneously with the related Fixed Rate Loans of the
                 other Banks), and

                          (b)     after each of its Euro-Dollar Loans or
                 Sterling Loans, as the case may be, to the Company has been
                 repaid, all payments of principal which would otherwise be
                 applied to repay such Fixed Rate Loans shall be applied to
                 repay its Base Rate Loans instead.

                 1.28.  Section 8.05.  Section 8.05 of the Agreement is hereby
amended to read as follows:

                 Section 8.05.  Substitution of Bank.  If (i) the obligation of
         any Bank to make Euro-Dollar Loans or Sterling Loans has been
         suspended pursuant to Section 8.01(b)(iii) or Section 8.02, (ii) any
         Bank has demanded compensation





                                      -22-
<PAGE>   23
         under Section 8.03 or payment of Taxes or Other Taxes under Section
         2.17, or (iii) after satisfaction of all applicable conditions
         precedent, any Bank fails to fund when due any Committed Loan it is
         obligated to fund under this Agreement, the Company shall have the
         right, with the assistance of the Agent, to seek a mutually
         satisfactory substitute bank or banks (which may be one or more of the
         Banks) to purchase the Note and assume the Commitment of such Bank
         (any such Bank is herein called an "Affected Bank").  Each Affected
         Bank agrees to sell, without recourse, all of its Commitment, its
         interest in this Agreement and its Note to any such bank for an amount
         equal to the sum of the outstanding unpaid principal of and accrued
         interest on the Loans of such Affected Bank and all commitment fees
         and other fees and amounts due such Affected Bank hereunder,
         calculated, in each case, to the date such Commitment, interest in
         this Agreement and Note are purchased (the principal of and accrued
         interest on Sterling Loans shall be paid in Sterling and all other
         amounts shall be paid in Dollars).

                 1.29.  Section 9.06(c).  The first sentence of Section 9.06(c)
of the Agreement is hereby amended by inserting the parenthetical "(in the case
of Sterling Loans, based on the Current Dollar Amount of such Sterling Loans in
effect at such time)" after the phrase "equals $10,000,000 or more".

                 1.30.  Section 9.14.  The Agreement is hereby further amended
by inserting, immediately following Section 9.13 of the Agreement, a new
Section 9.14 reading as follows:

                 SECTION 9.14.  Judgment Currency.  The obligations of the
         Company hereunder and under the Notes to make payments in Dollars or
         in Sterling (the "Obligation Currency") shall not be discharged or
         satisfied by any tender or recovery pursuant to any judgment expressed
         in or converted into any currency other than the Obligation Currency
         except to the extent to which such tender or recovery shall result in
         the effective receipt by the Banks of the full amount of the
         Obligation Currency expressed to be payable hereunder and under the
         Notes, and accordingly such obligations of the Company shall be
         enforceable as an alternate or additional cause of action for the
         purpose of recovery in the Obligation Currency of the amount (if any)
         by which such effective receipt shall fall short of the full amount of
         the Obligation Currency expressed to be payable hereunder and under
         the Notes and shall not be affected by judgment being obtained for any
         other sums due under this Agreement and the Notes.

                 1.31.    Schedule VII.  The Agreement is further amended by
inserting, immediately after Schedule VI, a new Schedule VII in the form of
Schedule VII hereto.

                 1.32.    Exhibits A, B, C, D and I.  Exhibits A, B, C, D and I
to the Agreement are hereby amended by replacing such exhibits with Exhibits A,
B, C, D and I hereto, respectively.

         2.      Effectiveness.  The effectiveness of this Amendment is subject
to the satisfaction (or waiver in accordance with Section 9.05 of the
Agreement) of receipt by the Agent of:

                 2.1.     counterparts of this Amendment signed by each of the
         parties hereto (or, in the case of any party as to which an executed

         For value received, Union Texas Petroleum Holdings, Inc., a Delaware

notations to evidence the foregoing information with respect to each such Loan
then outstanding shall be endorsed by the Bank on the schedule attached hereto,
or on a continuation of such schedule attached to and made a part hereof;
provided that the failure of the Bank to make any such recordation or
endorsement shall not affect the obligations of the Company hereunder or under
the Credit Agreement.

         This note is one of the Notes referred to in the Amended and Restated
Credit Agreement dated as of May 13, 1994 among the Company, the lenders and

lenders and Co-Agents parties thereto and the Agent.  Terms not defined herein
and defined in the Credit Agreement are used herein with the same meanings.
Reference is made to the Credit Agreement for provisions for the prepayment
hereof and the acceleration of the maturity hereof.  This note shall be
construed in accordance with and governed by the law of the State of Texas.

                    FIRST AMENDMENT TO AMENDED AND RESTATED
                         SUBSIDIARY GUARANTY AGREEMENT

         This First Amendment to Amended and Restated Subsidiary Guaranty dated
as of November 21, 1994 (this "Guaranty Amendment") is among each of the
Subsidiary Guarantors listed on the signature pages hereof under the caption
"Subsidiary Guarantors" and NationsBank of Texas, N.A. (the "Agent"), as agent

among Union Texas Petroleum Holdings, Inc. (the "Company"), the Co-Agents and
lenders parties thereto ("Banks") and the Agent.

         In consideration of the mutual covenants contained herein, the parties
hereto agree as follows:

         1.      Amendments to the Guaranty Agreement.  The Amended and
Restated Subsidiary Guaranty Agreement dated as of May 13, 1994 (the "Guaranty
Agreement") executed by the Subsidiary Guarantors and the Agent is hereby
amended as follows:

                 1.1.  The preamble to the Guaranty Agreement is hereby amended
by deleting the parenthetical ("Agreement") and inserting in lieu thereof the
following parenthetical (as may be amended or otherwise modified from time to
time in accordance with the terms hereof, the "Agreement").

                 1.2.  The third recital to the Guaranty Agreement is hereby
amended by deleting the parenthetical ("Amended and Restated Credit Agreement")
and inserting in lieu thereof the following parenthetical:

         ("1994 Credit Agreement"; and the 1994 Credit Agreement, as it may be
         amended or otherwise modified from time to time, is herein called the
         "Amended and Restated Credit Agreement")

                 1.3.  The fourth recital to the Guaranty Agreement is hereby
amended by inserting, immediately after the dollar amount "$350,000,000", the
phrase "or such other amount as may be available pursuant thereto".

                 1.4.  The seventh recital to the Guaranty Agreement is hereby
amended to read as follows:

                 WHEREAS, as a condition to borrowings under the Amended and
         Restated Credit Agreement, each Required Guarantor is required to
         execute and deliver to the Agent this Agreement whereby such entity
         shall, subject to Section 2.08 hereof, guarantee the payment when due
         of the principal of and interest on all Loans and all other amounts
         payable at any time, whether denominated in





<PAGE>   45
         Sterling, Dollars or otherwise, by any Obligor under any of the
         Financing Documents or under the 1994 Credit Agreement or any note
         issued in connection with the 1994 Credit Agreement, including,
         without limitation, interest which accrues during a proceeding which
         occurs under the U.S. Bankruptcy Code or which would otherwise accrue
         under the terms of any of the Financing Documents, the 1994 Credit
         Agreement or any note issued in connection with the 1994 Credit
         Agreement, but for a proceeding under the U.S. Bankruptcy Code (such
         principal, interest and other amounts being herein called the
         "Guaranteed Amounts");

                 1.5.  Section 1.01.  The Guaranty Agreement is hereby further
amended by deleting the phrase "under the 1992 Agreement" from the second
sentence of Section 1.01 and inserting in lieu thereof the phrase "under the
1994 Credit Agreement".

                 1.6.  Section 2.09.  The Guaranty Agreement is hereby further
amended by inserting, immediately following Section 2.08 of the Guaranty
Agreement, a new Section 2.09 reading as follows:

                 SECTION 2.09.  Obligation Currency.  The obligations of each
         Subsidiary Guarantor hereunder to make payments in Dollars or in
         Sterling (the "Obligation Currency") shall not be discharged or
         satisfied by any tender or recovery pursuant to any judgment expressed
         in or converted into any currency other than the Obligation Currency
         except to the extent to which such tender or recovery shall result in
         the effective receipt by the Banks of the full amount of the
         Obligation Currency expressed to be payable hereunder, and accordingly
         such obligations of each Subsidiary Guarantor shall be enforceable as
         an alternate or additional cause of action for the purpose of recovery
         in the Obligation Currency of the amount (if any) by which such
         effective receipt shall fall short of the full amount of the
         Obligation Currency expressed to be payable hereunder and shall not be
         effected by judgment being obtained for any other sums due under this
         Agreement.

                 1.7.  Section 3.10 of the Guaranty Agreement is hereby amended
to read as follows:

                 SECTION 3.10.  Judgment Currency.  Each Subsidiary Guarantor
         agrees to indemnify the Agent and each Bank against any loss incurred
         by it as a result of any judgment or order being given or made and
         expressed and paid in a currency (the "Judgment Currency") other than
         the Obligation Currency and as a result of any variation as between
         (i) the rate of exchange at which the Obligation Currency amount is
         converted into the Judgment Currency for the purpose of such judgment
         or order and (ii) the spot rate of exchange in the Sterling Lending
         Office of the Agent or any Bank at which the Agent or such Bank on the
         date of payment of such judgment or order is able to purchase
         Obligation Currency with the amount of the Judgment Currency actually
         received by the Agent or such Bank.  The foregoing indemnity shall
         constitute a separate and independent obligation of each Subsidiary
         Guarantor and shall continue in full





                                      -2-
<PAGE>   46
         force and effect notwithstanding any such judgment or order as
         aforesaid.  The term "spot rate of exchange" shall include any
         premiums and costs of exchange payable in connection with the purchase
         of, or conversion into, the Obligation Currency.

         2.      Acknowledgement and Consent.  To induce the Agent and the
Banks to execute the First Amendment Agreement dated as of November 21, 1994
among the Company, the Banks and Co-Agents parties thereto, and the Agent (the
"Credit Agreement Amendment") and other Financing Documents, each of the
undersigned Subsidiary Guarantors hereby (a) consents to and agrees to the
terms of the Credit Agreement Amendment and the Credit Agreement as amended

none of such Subsidiary Guarantor's obligations, none of the Banks' or the

hereby, nor any other Financing Document, would be released, impaired or

Amendment and other Financing Documents.

         3.      Miscellaneous.

                 3.1.  Amendments, Etc.  No amendment or waiver of any

                           OPINION OF GENERAL COUNSEL

                               November ___, 1994

To the Banks and the Agent
   Referred to Below
c/o NationsBank of Texas, N.A., as Agent
700 Louisiana Street
Houston, Texas  77002

Dear Sirs:

              I am General Counsel, Vice President-Administration, and
Secretary of Union Texas Petroleum Holdings, Inc., a Delaware corporation (the
"Company"), and have acted as counsel for:

              (a)    the Company in connection with (i) the Amended and
       Restated Credit Agreement dated as of May 13, 1994 (the "Existing Credit
       Agreement") among the Company, the Banks and Co-Agents listed on the
       signature pages thereof and NationsBank of Texas, N.A., as Agent (the
       "Agent") and (ii) the First Amendment Agreement dated as of November
       ___, 1994 (the "Credit Agreement Amendment") among the Company, the
       Banks and Co-Agents listed on the signature pages thereof and the Agent;
       and

              (b)    Union Texas Petroleum Energy Corporation, a Delaware
       corporation, Union Texas International Corporation, a Delaware
       corporation, Unistar, Inc., a Delaware corporation, Union Texas East
       Kalimantan Limited, a Bahamian corporation, and Union Texas Products
       Corporation, a Delaware corporation (collectively, the "Subsidiary
       Guarantors" and together with the Company, the "Obligors"), in
       connection with (i) the Amended and Restated Subsidiary Guaranty
       Agreement dated as of May 13, 1994 (the "Existing Subsidiary Guaranty
       Agreement") among the Subsidiary Guarantors and the Agent and (ii) the
       First Amendment to Amended and Restated Subsidiary Guaranty Agreement
       dated as of November ___, 1994 (the "Guaranty Amendment") among the
       Subsidiary Guarantors and the Agent.

Terms defined in the Existing Credit Agreement, as amended by the Credit
Agreement Amendment (the "Credit Agreement"), and not otherwise defined herein
are used herein as defined in the Credit Agreement.

              In connection with the opinions expressed below, I have examined
or caused to be examined executed counterparts of the following (collectively,
the "Financing Documents"):

              (a)    the Existing Credit Agreement,

              (b)    the Credit Agreement Amendment,
<PAGE>   51
To the Banks and the Agent
November ___, 1994
Page 2



              (c)    the Existing Subsidiary Guaranty Agreement,

              (d)    the Guaranty Amendment, and

              (e)    twenty four (24) promissory notes dated ______________,
       1994, each substantially in the form of Exhibit A to the Credit
       Agreement, one payable to each Bank.

              I have also examined or caused to be examined originals or
copies, certified or otherwise identified to my satisfaction, of such other
instruments, documents and records as I deemed necessary to express the
opinions hereinafter set forth.  To the extent relevant to my opinion, I have
assumed, without independent verification, (i) the due execution and delivery
of each Financing Document by each party thereto (other than the Obligors),
(ii) the genuineness of all signatures on all documents submitted to me, (iii)
that each party (other than the Obligors) to each of the Financing Documents is
duly organized, validly existing and in good standing under the laws of the
jurisdiction of its organization and has full power and authority to enter into
and to carry out its obligations under such Financing Documents, (iv) that the
execution and delivery of each of the Financing Documents by each party thereto
(other than the Obligors) and the performance of its obligations under such
Financing Documents have been duly authorized by all necessary proceedings and
actions, (v) that each of the Financing Documents is the legal, valid and
binding obligation of each party thereto (other than the Obligors), enforceable
against such party in accordance with the terms of such Financing Documents,
subject to limitations of the types described in the opinion of Andrews & Kurth
L.L.P. delivered to you pursuant to the Financing Documents, and (vi) the
authenticity of all documents submitted to me as originals and the conformity
to authentic original documents of all documents submitted to me as certified,
conformed or photostatic copies.  I have relied, to the extent that I deem such
reliance proper, upon certificates of officers of one or more of the Obligors
and of governmental officials as to matters of fact not independently
established by me.

              For purposes of the opinion set forth in paragraph 2 below, I
have (i) relied on the opinion of Andrews & Kurth L.L.P.  with respect to the
agreements and instruments identified on Schedule I thereto, and (ii) examined
or caused to be examined each other agreement or other instrument binding upon
any Obligor, a breach of or default under which would, in my judgment, have a
material adverse effect upon the Company and its Subsidiaries taken as a whole.
As to other agreements and instruments, I have not undertaken such a review for
purposes of this opinion, given the volume of such documents and given the fact
that by virtue of the character of such documents and the historical practices
of the Company with respect thereto, I have no reason to believe that a breach
of or default under any such document would arise by virtue of the execution,
delivery and performance of the Financing Documents.

To the Banks and the Agent
November ___, 1994
Page 3



              Based on the foregoing and subject to the qualifications and
limitations set forth below, I am of the opinion that:

              1.     Each of the Obligors has all material governmental
licenses, authorizations, consents and approvals required to own its assets and
to carry on its business as now conducted.

              2.     To the best of my knowledge, the execution, delivery and
performance of each of the Financing Documents, and the performance of the
Credit Agreement and the Existing Subsidiary Guaranty Agreement as amended by
the Guaranty Amendment (the "Subsidiary Guaranty Agreement"), by each Obligor
which is a party thereto do not constitute a breach of or default under, or
result in the creation or imposition of any Lien on any material asset of the
Company or any Subsidiary under, any provision of any instrument or agreement
evidencing or governing Debt binding upon such Obligor or any other material
agreement, judgment, injunction, order, decree or other instrument binding upon
such Obligor.

              3.     To the best of my knowledge, there is no action, suit or
proceeding pending against, threatened against or affecting the Company or any
of its Subsidiaries or any of their respective properties or interests, at law
or in admiralty or equity, before any court or arbitrator or any governmental
body, agency or official, foreign or domestic, in which there is a reasonable
possibility of an adverse decision which could materially adversely affect the
business, financial position or results of operations of the Company and its
Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, or which in any manner draws into question the
validity of any of the Financing Documents, the Credit Agreement or the
Subsidiary Guaranty Agreement.

              My opinions in paragraph 1 are rendered only with respect to the
constitutions, laws, rules and regulations which are currently in effect and
applicable court rulings and orders which have been published and are generally
available.   In addition, the foregoing opinions are rendered only as of the
date hereof, and I disclaim any obligation to advise you of changes thereafter.

              I am a member of the bar of the State of Texas only, and this
opinion is limited in all respects to the laws of the State of Texas, the
General Corporation Law of Delaware and federal law of the United States of
America, and, to the limited extent described below, the laws of The
Commonwealth of The Bahamas and The Republic of Indonesia.  In rendering
certain of the opinions expressed above, I have relied, with your approval,
upon an opinion, dated the date hereof, of Andrews & Kurth L.L.P., a copy of
which has been furnished to you.  My opinion in paragraph 1 addresses, with
respect to Union Texas East Kalimantan Limited, the laws of The Commonwealth of
The Bahamas and The Republic of Indonesia and such opinion with respect to such
laws is, with your permission and without independent investigation, and
subject to the other qualifications
<PAGE>   53
To the Banks and the Agent
November ___, 1994
Page 4



set forth in this paragraph,  given solely in reliance upon and limited in
scope to the opinions of Graham, Thompson & Co. and Mochtar, Karuwin & Komar,
respectively, dated May 13, 1994 (the "May 1994 Opinions") addressed to each of
you as "Banks" under the Existing Credit Agreement, copies of which May 1994
Opinions have been furnished to you, and my opinion incorporates by reference
all qualifications, exceptions and limitations set forth therein.  As you know,
neither Graham, Thompson & Co. nor Mochtar, Karuwin & Komar have reviewed the
Credit Agreement Amendment, the Guaranty Amendment or the Notes, nor have they
updated their respective opinions since May 13, 1994.  I have assumed, with
your permission and without independent investigation, that the May 1994
Opinions are true and correct as of the date hereof as if such opinions were
published on the date hereof and the Credit Agreement Amendment, the Guaranty
Amendment and the Notes were included in the "Financing Documents" referred to
therein.

              This opinion is for the benefit of and may be relied upon by the
Banks, the Agent, the Co-Agents, their respective successors and assigns, their
respective counsel and Participants in connection with the transactions
contemplated by the Credit Agreement, the Credit Agreement Amendment, the
Subsidiary Guaranty and the Guaranty Amendment.  Otherwise, this opinion may
not be used, published, circulated or relied upon by any other Person for any
purpose without my prior written consent.

                                         Very truly yours,

To the Banks and the Agent
    Referred to Below
c/o NationsBank of Texas, N.A., as Agent
700 Louisiana Street
Houston, Texas  77002

Dear Sirs:

              We have acted as special counsel to:

              (a)    Union Texas Petroleum Holdings, Inc., a Delaware
       corporation (the "Company"), in connection with (i) the Amended and
       Restated Credit Agreement dated as of May 13, 1994 (the "Existing Credit
       Agreement") among the Company, the Banks and Co-Agents listed on the
       signature pages thereof and NationsBank of Texas, N.A., as Agent (the
       "Agent") and (ii) the First Amendment Agreement dated as of November
       ___, 1994 (the "Credit Agreement Amendment") among the Company, the
       Banks and Co-Agents listed on the signature pages thereof and the Agent;
       and

              (b)    Union Texas Petroleum Energy Corporation, a Delaware
       corporation, Union Texas International Corporation, a Delaware
       corporation, Unistar, Inc., a Delaware corporation, Union Texas East
       Kalimantan Limited, a Bahamian corporation, and Union Texas Products
       Corporation, a Delaware corporation (collectively, the "Subsidiary
       Guarantors" and together with the Company, the "Obligors"), in
       connection with (i) the Amended and Restated Subsidiary Guaranty
       Agreement dated as of May 13, 1994 (the "Existing Subsidiary Guaranty
       Agreement") among the Subsidiary Guarantors and the Agent and (ii) the
       First Amendment to Amended and Restated Subsidiary Guaranty Agreement
       dated as of November ____, 1994 (the "Guaranty Amendment") among the
       Subsidiary Guarantors and the Agent.

Terms defined in the Existing Credit Agreement, as amended by the Credit
Agreement Amendment (the "Credit Agreement"), and not otherwise defined herein
are used herein as defined in the Credit Agreement.

              In connection with the opinions expressed below, we have examined
executed counterparts of the following (collectively, the "Financing
Documents"):

              (a)    the Existing Credit Agreement,

              (b)    the Credit Agreement Amendment,
<PAGE>   55
To the Banks and the Agent
November ___, 1994
Page 2



              (c)    the Existing Subsidiary Guaranty Agreement,

              (d)    the Guaranty Amendment, and

              (e)    twenty four (24) promissory notes dated _________________,
       1994, each substantially in the form of Exhibit A to the Credit
       Agreement, one payable to each Bank (collectively, the "Notes").

              We have also examined originals or copies, certified or otherwise
identified to our satisfaction, of such other instruments, documents and
records as we deemed necessary to express the opinions hereinafter set forth.
To the extent relevant to our opinion, we have assumed, without independent
verification, (i) the due execution and delivery of each Financing Document by
each party thereto (other than the Obligors), (ii) the genuineness of all
signatures on all documents submitted to us, (iii) that each party (other than
the Obligors) to each of the Financing Documents is duly organized, validly
existing and in good standing under the laws of the jurisdiction of its
organization and has full power and authority to enter into and to carry out
its obligations under such Financing Documents, (iv) that the execution and
delivery of each of the Financing Documents by each party thereto (other than
the Obligors) and the performance of its obligations under such Financing
Documents have been duly authorized by all necessary proceedings and actions,
(v) that each of the Financing Documents is the legal, valid and binding
obligation of each party thereto (other than the Obligors) enforceable against
such party in accordance with the terms of such Financing Documents, subject to
limitations of the types described herein, and (vi) the authenticity of all
documents submitted to us as originals and the conformity to authentic original
documents of all documents submitted to us as certified, conformed or
photostatic copies.  We have relied, to the extent that we deem such reliance
proper, upon certificates of officers of one or more of the Obligors and of
governmental officials as to matters of fact not independently established by
us.  We have also examined the representations and warranties of the Company
contained in the Credit Agreement and have relied, to the extent we deem such
reliance proper, upon the relevant facts stated therein.

              Based on the foregoing and subject to the qualifications and
limitations set forth below, we are of the opinion that:

              1.     (a) Each of the Obligors is a corporation duly
incorporated, validly existing and in good standing under the laws of its
jurisdiction of incorporation, and has all corporate power and authority
required to own its assets and to carry on its business as now conducted.

              (b)    The execution, delivery and performance by each Obligor of
each Financing Document to which it is a party will not violate the Public
Utility Holding
<PAGE>   56
To the Banks and the Agent
November ___, 1994
Page 3



Company Act of 1935, the Investment Company Act of 1940 or the Interstate
Commerce Act.

              2.     The execution, delivery and performance of each of the
Financing Documents, and the performance of the Credit Agreement and the
Existing Subsidiary Guaranty Agreement as amended by the Guaranty Amendment
(the "Subsidiary Guaranty Agreement"), by each Obligor which is a party thereto
are within such Obligor's corporate powers, have been duly authorized by all
necessary corporate action, and do not constitute a breach or default under,
any provision of applicable law or regulation known to us after reasonable
inquiry or the certificate of incorporation or bylaws of such Obligor.

              3.     To the best of our knowledge, the execution, delivery and
performance of each of the Financing Documents, and the performance of the
Credit Agreement and the Subsidiary Guaranty Agreement, by each Obligor which
is a party thereto do not constitute a breach of or default under, or result in
the creation or imposition of any Lien on any material asset of the Company or
any Subsidiary under, any provision of the instruments and agreements
identified in Schedule I hereto.

              4.     No authorization, consent or approval of any governmental
body, agency or official is required in connection with the execution, delivery
or performance of any of the Financing Documents, or the performance of the
Credit Agreement or the Subsidiary Guaranty Agreement, by any Obligor which is
a party thereto.

              5.     (a)    The Existing Credit Agreement, the Credit Agreement
Amendment and the Notes have been duly executed and delivered by the Company,
and the Credit Agreement, the Credit Agreement Amendment and the Notes
constitute legal, valid and binding obligations of the Company, enforceable
against the Company in accordance with their respective terms.

              (b)    The Existing Subsidiary Guaranty Agreement and the
Guaranty Amendment have been duly executed and delivered by each of the
Subsidiary Guarantors, and the Subsidiary Guaranty Agreement and the Guaranty
Amendment constitute legal, valid and binding obligations of each of the
Subsidiary Guarantors, enforceable against each of the Subsidiary Guarantors in
accordance with their respective terms.

              6.     If all material facts (as we understand them) and issues
of law were presented and properly argued, a Texas court or a federal court
sitting in the State of Texas and applying the laws of the State of Texas
should hold that the consent by the Company in Section 9.09 of the Credit
Agreement, and by each Subsidiary Guarantor in Section 3.05 of the Subsidiary
Guaranty Agreement, to the non-exclusive personal jurisdiction of the courts of
the State of Texas and of any federal court located in the State of Texas is
valid.  In this regard we call to your attention that such consents to
non-exclusive jurisdiction are not effective to (1) confer subject matter
jurisdiction that
<PAGE>   57
To the Banks and the Agent
November ___, 1994
Page 4



does not otherwise exist in such court or (2) establish diversity jurisdiction
that does not otherwise exist in an action brought in federal court.

              7.     Neither the execution, delivery and performance by any
Obligor of the Financing Documents to which it is a party, nor the use of the
proceeds of the Loans in accordance with Section 5.09 of the Credit Agreement,
will violate the provisions of Regulations G, T, U or X of the Board of
Governors of the Federal Reserve System.

              The opinions set forth above are subject to the following
additional assumptions, limitations and qualifications:

              a.     Our opinions with respect to the enforceability of the
Financing Documents are subject to the qualification that such enforceability
may be (i) limited by applicable bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization,
fraudulent transfer, moratorium or similar laws affecting the rights of
creditors generally, (ii) subject to general principles of equity (regardless
of whether such enforceability is considered in a proceeding at law or in
equity), including, without limitation, concepts of materiality,
reasonableness, good faith and fair dealing, and (iii) limited by the power of
a court to award damages in lieu of equitable remedies (including specific
performance or injunctive relief) or otherwise to refuse to grant a particular
remedy sought by the parties to the Financing Documents.

              b.     We express no opinion herein as to (1) the right of any
Bank to set-off against funds held in any special account maintained by the
Company with such Bank or which are otherwise subject to special agreement
between the Company and such Bank; (2) whether the provisions of the Credit
Agreement which permit the Agent, the Co-Agents or any Bank to take action or
make determinations may be subject to a requirement that such action be taken
or such determination be made in good faith; (3) whether the holder of a Note
may, under certain circumstances, be called upon to prove the outstanding
principal amount of the loans evidenced thereby; (4) the effect of the law of
any jurisdiction (other than Texas) wherein any Bank may be located which
limits rates of interest which may be charged or collected by such Bank; and
(5) the enforceability of any provision in the Financing Documents that
purports to (i) require indemnification for the negligence or wilful misconduct
of the indemnitee or to otherwise require any Obligor to provide
indemnification to the extent the same may be in conflict with public policy,
(ii) limit the effect of any delay or omission of enforcement of rights or
remedies or any course of performance or course of dealing between the parties,
(iii) create an agreement to agree, (iv) fix evidentiary standards or venue of
any proceeding, (v) waive rights to a trial by jury, or (vi) waive rights to
notices, legal defenses or other benefits that cannot, as a matter of law, be
effectively waived.

              c.     Whenever this opinion states the existence or absence of
any fact to the best of our knowledge, such statement is intended to convey
that, during the course of our
<PAGE>   58
To the Banks and the Agent
November ___, 1994
Page 5



representation of the Obligors with respect to matters addressed herein, no
information has come to our attention which has given us actual knowledge of
facts contrary to the statements so expressed herein.

              d.     In rendering our opinions in paragraph 1 we have relied
upon the description of the properties, assets and businesses of the Obligors
set forth in the Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 1993,
filed by the Company with the Securities and Exchange Commission, as
supplemented by Reports on Form 10-Q for the quarters ended March 31, 1994 and
June 30, 1994, filed by the Company with the Securities and Exchange
Commission.

              e.     In rendering the opinions in paragraphs 2 and 5, we have
assumed that (i) there are no fees, points, premiums or other sums contracted
for, charged to or paid or to be paid by the Company to the Banks on account of
the transactions described in the Credit Agreement other than those described
in the Credit Agreement and those described in the letters dated May 13, 1994
from the Agent to us and (ii) the parties to the Financing Documents will
comply strictly with the precise terms of the Financing Documents, including,
without limitation, the usury savings clauses set forth therein with respect to
any consideration contemplated by Financing Documents that will constitute
interest under Texas law.

              f.     In rendering our opinions in paragraph 7 we have assumed
that the representations of the Company and the Banks set forth in Sections
4.12 and 9.07, respectively, of the Credit Agreement will be true and correct
at all times.

              g.     The foregoing opinions are rendered only with respect to
the constitutions, laws, rules and regulations which are currently in effect
and applicable court rulings and orders which have been published and are
generally available.   In addition, the foregoing opinions are rendered only as
of the date hereof, and we disclaim any obligation to advise you of changes
thereafter.

              h.     Insofar as our opinion relates to the laws of The
Commonwealth of The Bahamas and The Republic of Indonesia it is, with your
permission and without independent investigation, and subject to the other
qualifications set forth in this paragraph h, given solely in reliance upon and
limited in scope to the opinions of Graham, Thompson & Co. and Mochtar, Karuwin
& Komar, respectively, dated May 13, 1994 (the "May 1994 Opinions") addressed
to each of you as "Banks" under the Existing Credit Agreement, copies of which
May 1994 Opinions have been furnished to each of you, and our opinion
incorporates by reference all qualifications, exceptions and limitations set
forth therein.  As you know, neither Graham, Thompson & Co. nor Mochtar,
Karuwin & Komar have reviewed the Credit Agreement Amendment, the Guaranty
Amendment or the Notes, nor have they updated their respective opinions since
May 13, 1994.  We have assumed, with your permission and without independent
<PAGE>   59
To the Banks and the Agent
November ___, 1994
Page 6



investigation, that the May 1994 Opinions are true and correct as of the date
hereof as if such opinions were published on the date hereof and the Credit
Agreement Amendment, the Guaranty Amendment and the Notes were included in the
"Financing Documents" referred to therein.

              This opinion is limited in all respects to the laws of the State
of Texas, the General Corporation Law of Delaware and federal law of the United
States of America, and, to the limited extent described in paragraph h above,
the laws of The Commonwealth of The Bahamas and The Republic of Indonesia.

              This opinion is for the benefit of and may be relied upon by the
Banks, the Agent, the Co-Agents, their respective successors and assigns, their
respective counsel and Participants in connection with the transactions
contemplated by the Credit Agreement, the Credit Agreement Amendment, the
Subsidiary Guaranty Agreement and the Guaranty Amendment and may be relied upon
by Newton W. Wilson, III, General Counsel of the Company, in rendering his
opinion to the Banks in connection with such transactions.  Otherwise, this
opinion may not be used, published, circulated or relied upon by any other

                    OPINION OF SPECIAL COUNSEL TO THE AGENT

                               November 21, 1994



To NationsBank of Texas, N.A., as Agent,
  and to each of the Banks referred to below

Ladies and Gentlemen:

We have acted as special counsel to NationsBank of Texas, N.A., acting for
itself and as Agent ("Agent"), in connection with the preparation, execution
and delivery of the First Amendment Agreement dated as of November 21, 1994
(the "Credit Amendment") among Union Texas Petroleum Holdings, Inc., a Delaware
corporation (the "Company"), the Banks and Co-Agents party to the Credit
Agreement (defined below) and the Agent, which Credit Amendment amends the
Amended and Restated Credit Agreement dated as of May 13, 1994 (the "Credit
Agreement") among the Company, the banks listed on the signature pages thereof
(the "Banks"), the Agent and the Co-Agents.  Capitalized terms defined in the
Credit Agreement as amended by the Credit Amendment (the "Amended Credit
Agreement") and not defined herein are used herein as therein defined.

In that connection, we have examined counterparts of the Credit Amendment
executed by the Agent and the Company respectively and the following documents:

       (1)    The Notes delivered to the Agent on the date hereof.

       (2)    The First Amendment to Amended and Restated Subsidiary Guaranty
              Agreement delivered to the Agent on the date hereof (the
              "Guaranty Amendment").

       (3)    The legal opinions delivered to the Agent pursuant to Sections
              2.4 and 2.5 of the Credit Amendment.

In our examination of the documents referred to above, we have assumed the
authenticity of all such documents submitted to us as originals, the
genuineness of all signatures and the conformity to the originals of all such
documents submitted to us as copies.  We have also assumed the accuracy of all
matters set forth in the certificates delivered to the Agent in connection with
the Credit Amendment or the Credit Agreement and assumed that each of Company,
the Banks, the Agent and the Co-Agents has duly executed and delivered, with
all necessary power and authority (corporate and otherwise), the Credit
Amendment and the Credit Agreement, that the Company has duly executed and
delivered, with all necessary power and authority (corporate and otherwise),
the respective Notes, and that each of the Required Guarantors and the Agent
has duly executed and delivered, with all necessary power and authority
(corporate and otherwise), the Subsidiary Guaranty Agreement and the Guaranty
Amendment.  We have also assumed that no Bank has requested multiple Notes
pursuant to Section 2.05(b) of the Amended Credit Agreement.

Based upon the foregoing examination of documents and assumptions and upon such
other investigation as we have deemed necessary, we are of the opinion that the
documents referred to in items (1), (2) and (3) above are substantially
responsive to the requirements of the Credit Amendment.

         executed in any number of counterparts, each of which when so executed

         Amendment, the Agreement as amended hereby and the Acknowledgment
         constituting "Financing Documents" for purposes thereof, and (ii) no

         material respect when made, such event shall constitute an "Event or
         Default" under the Agreement, as amended hereby.

         IN WITNESS WHEREOF, the parties hereto have caused this Amendment to be
executed by their respective officers thereunto duly authorized, as of the date

                                January 31, 1995

                 Reference is made to the Amended and Restated Credit Agreement
dated as of May 13, 1994, as amended by the First Amendment Agreement dated as
of  November 21, 1994 (as so amended, the "Credit Agreement"), among Union

(the "Amendment") among the Company, the Banks and Co-Agents parties thereto,
and the Agent.  Undefined capitalized terms are used herein as defined in the
Credit Agreement as amended by the Amendment (the "Amended Credit Agreement").

                 To induce the Agent and the Banks to execute the Amendment,
each of the undersigned Subsidiary Guarantors hereby (a) consents to and agrees
to the terms of the Amendment and the Amended Credit Agreement, (b) agrees that
(i) none of such Subsidiary Guarantor's obligations under or in connection with
the Financing Documents and none of the Banks' or the Agent's rights and
remedies with respect to any Subsidiary Guarantor is released, impaired or
affected thereby or by the foregoing, (ii) neither the Subsidiary Guaranty
Agreement nor any other Financing Document provided by any Subsidiary Guarantor
is released, impaired or affected thereby or by any of the foregoing, and (iii)
this acknowledgment shall not be construed as requiring the consent or
agreement of any Subsidiary Guarantor in any circumstance, (c) ratifies and
confirms all provisions of all Financing Documents executed by such Subsidiary
Guarantor and all documents pertaining thereto or referred to therein, and (d)
agrees that none of such Subsidiary Guarantor's obligations, none of the Banks'
or the Agent's rights and remedies and neither the Subsidiary Guaranty
Agreement, nor any other Financing Document, would be released, impaired or
affected if such Subsidiary Guarantor had not acknowledged the Amendment, the
Amended Credit Agreement or any other Financing Document.

Acknowledgement and Consent to be duly executed and delivered by their
respective offices thereunto duly authorized, as of the date first above
written.

                    FIRST AMENDMENT TO AMENDED AND RESTATED
                         SUBSIDIARY GUARANTY AGREEMENT

         This First Amendment to Amended and Restated Subsidiary Guaranty dated
as of November 21, 1994 (this "Guaranty Amendment") is among each of the
Subsidiary Guarantors listed on the signature pages hereof under the caption
"Subsidiary Guarantors" and NationsBank of Texas, N.A. (the "Agent"), as agent
for the banks under the Amended and Restated Credit Agreement dated as of May
13, 1994 (as the same may be amended from time to time, the "Credit Agreement")
among Union Texas Petroleum Holdings, Inc. (the "Company"), the Co-Agents and
lenders parties thereto ("Banks") and the Agent.

         In consideration of the mutual covenants contained herein, the parties
hereto agree as follows:

         1.      Amendments to the Guaranty Agreement.  The Amended and
Restated Subsidiary Guaranty Agreement dated as of May 13, 1994 (the "Guaranty
Agreement") executed by the Subsidiary Guarantors and the Agent is hereby
amended as follows:

                 1.1.  The preamble to the Guaranty Agreement is hereby amended
by deleting the parenthetical ("Agreement") and inserting in lieu thereof the
following parenthetical (as may be amended or otherwise modified from time to
time in accordance with the terms hereof, the "Agreement").

                 1.2.  The third recital to the Guaranty Agreement is hereby
amended by deleting the parenthetical ("Amended and Restated Credit Agreement")
and inserting in lieu thereof the following parenthetical:

         ("1994 Credit Agreement"; and the 1994 Credit Agreement, as it may be
         amended or otherwise modified from time to time, is herein called the
         "Amended and Restated Credit Agreement")

                 1.3.  The fourth recital to the Guaranty Agreement is hereby
amended by inserting, immediately after the dollar amount "$350,000,000", the
phrase "or such other amount as may be available pursuant thereto".

                 1.4.  The seventh recital to the Guaranty Agreement is hereby
amended to read as follows:

                 WHEREAS, as a condition to borrowings under the Amended and
         Restated Credit Agreement, each Required Guarantor is required to
         execute and deliver to the Agent this Agreement whereby such entity
         shall, subject to Section 2.08 hereof, guarantee the payment when due
         of the principal of and interest on all Loans and all other amounts
         payable at any time, whether denominated in
<PAGE>   2
         Sterling, Dollars or otherwise, by any Obligor under any of the
         Financing Documents or under the 1994 Credit Agreement or any note
         issued in connection with the 1994 Credit Agreement, including,
         without limitation, interest which accrues during a proceeding which
         occurs under the U.S. Bankruptcy Code or which would otherwise accrue
         under the terms of any of the Financing Documents, the 1994 Credit
         Agreement or any note issued in connection with the 1994 Credit
         Agreement, but for a proceeding under the U.S. Bankruptcy Code (such
         principal, interest and other amounts being herein called the
         "Guaranteed Amounts");

                 1.5.  Section 1.01.  The Guaranty Agreement is hereby further
amended by deleting the phrase "under the 1992 Agreement" from the second
sentence of Section 1.01 and inserting in lieu thereof the phrase "under the
1994 Credit Agreement".

                 1.6.  Section 2.09.  The Guaranty Agreement is hereby further
amended by inserting, immediately following Section 2.08 of the Guaranty
Agreement, a new Section 2.09 reading as follows:

                 SECTION 2.09.  Obligation Currency.  The obligations of each
         Subsidiary Guarantor hereunder to make payments in Dollars or in
         Sterling (the "Obligation Currency") shall not be discharged or
         satisfied by any tender or recovery pursuant to any judgment expressed
         in or converted into any currency other than the Obligation Currency
         except to the extent to which such tender or recovery shall result in
         the effective receipt by the Banks of the full amount of the
         Obligation Currency expressed to be payable hereunder, and accordingly
         such obligations of each Subsidiary Guarantor shall be enforceable as
         an alternate or additional cause of action for the purpose of recovery
         in the Obligation Currency of the amount (if any) by which such
         effective receipt shall fall short of the full amount of the
         Obligation Currency expressed to be payable hereunder and shall not be
         effected by judgment being obtained for any other sums due under this
         Agreement.

                 1.7.  Section 3.10 of the Guaranty Agreement is hereby amended
to read as follows:

                 SECTION 3.10.  Judgment Currency.  Each Subsidiary Guarantor
         agrees to indemnify the Agent and each Bank against any loss incurred
         by it as a result of any judgment or order being given or made and
         expressed and paid in a currency (the "Judgment Currency") other than
         the Obligation Currency and as a result of any variation as between
         (i) the rate of exchange at which the Obligation Currency amount is
         converted into the Judgment Currency for the purpose of such judgment
         or order and (ii) the spot rate of exchange in the Sterling Lending
         Office of the Agent or any Bank at which the Agent or such Bank on the
         date of payment of such judgment or order is able to purchase
         Obligation Currency with the amount of the Judgment Currency actually
         received by the Agent or such Bank.  The foregoing indemnity shall
         constitute a separate and independent obligation of each Subsidiary
         Guarantor and shall continue in full





                                     -2-
<PAGE>   3
         force and effect notwithstanding any such judgment or order as
         aforesaid.  The term "spot rate of exchange" shall include any
         premiums and costs of exchange payable in connection with the purchase
         of, or conversion into, the Obligation Currency.

         2.      Acknowledgement and Consent.  To induce the Agent and the
Banks to execute the First Amendment Agreement dated as of November 21, 1994
among the Company, the Banks and Co-Agents parties thereto, and the Agent (the
"Credit Agreement Amendment") and other Financing Documents, each of the
undersigned Subsidiary Guarantors hereby (a) consents to and agrees to the
terms of the Credit Agreement Amendment and the Credit Agreement as amended

any other Financing Document provided by any Subsidiary Guarantor is released,
impaired or affected thereby or by any of the foregoing, and (iii) this
acknowledgement shall not be construed as requiring the consent or agreement of
any Subsidiary Guarantor in any circumstance, (c) ratifies and confirms all
provisions of all Financing Documents executed by such Subsidiary Guarantor and
all documents pertaining thereto or referred to therein, and (d) agrees that
none of such Subsidiary Guarantor's obligations, none of the Banks' or the
Agent's rights and remedies and neither the Guaranty Agreement as amended
hereby, nor any other Financing Document, would be released, impaired or
affected if such Subsidiary Guarantor had not acknowledged the Credit Agreement
Amendment and other Financing Documents.

         3.      Miscellaneous.

                 3.1.  Amendments, Etc.  No amendment or waiver of any
provision of this Guaranty Amendment, and no consent to any departure by any
Subsidiary Guarantor, any Bank or the Agent herefrom, shall in any event be
effective unless effected in accordance with Section 3.03 of the Guaranty
Agreement.  This Guaranty Amendment shall become effective upon the execution
of this Guaranty Amendment by the Subsidiary Guarantors and the Agent.

Notice Date the Operator shall submit to the PRESIDENT an estimate of the total
gross Expenditures which were paid or incurred by the Working Interest Owners
from the Effective Date of this Agreement to the Commercial Discovery Notice
Date inclusive and charged to the Joint Account provided for in the Operating
Agreement.  The operator shall update said estimate with a definitive statement
of paid total gross Expenditures as soon thereafter as all relevant data are
available to the Operator.  Said estimated gross Expenditures as modified by
said updated statement are hereinafter called the "Pre-Discovery Expenditures".
The PRESIDENT shall have the option, exercisable by written notice given to the

Working Interest to the PRESIDENT and the PRESIDENT shall reimburse the Private
Working Interest Owners in an amount equal to thirty per cent (30%) of the
Pre-Discovery Expenditures.  The PRESIDENT shall have the option to make such
reimbursement by either of the following means, and in said written notice 
shall indicate which of said means the PRESIDENT shall use:

        (a)      By delivery in kind to the Private Working Interest Owners of
                 not less than one-fourth (1/4) of the PRESIDENT's
                 Proportionate Share of Petroleum produced and saved under this
                 Agreement, such deliveries to commence promptly after said
                 first Commercial Discovery Notice Date and to continue until
                 the aggregate value of the Petroleum so delivered equals the
                 sum to be reimbursed; or

        (b)      By payment in cash to the Private Working Interest Owners of
                 installments equal to the wellhead value as hereinafter
                 defined in Article VII of one-fourth (1/4) of the PRESIDENT's
                 Proportionate Share of Petroleum produced and saved under this
                 Agreement after said first Commercial Discovery Notice Date,
                 one such installment to be paid thirty (30) days following
                 each Calendar Quarter commencing with the Calendar Quarter
                 during which said first Commercial Discovery Notice Date
                 occurs and continuing until the aggregate payments so made

        4.2     Petroleum delivered to the Private Working Interest Owners
pursuant to Article 4.1(a) shall be free and clear of all costs to the Private
Working Interest Owners and the value thereof shall be computed on the basis of
wellhead value as defined in Articles 7.1(c)(ii) and 7.2(c) respectively.

        4.3     The reimbursement of Pre-Discovery Expenditures, whether in cash
or kind, provided in Article 4.1 shall not be computed as taxable income of the
Private Working Interest Owners either for income tax or for capital gains
purposes, provided the Private Working Interest Owners reduce their claim of
actual total Expenditure by the amount of such reimbursement.  Nor shall such
reimbursement or the assignment or acquisition of said additional Working
Interest be subject to any sales, transfer or other tax.

        4.4     The assignment of Working Interest provided in Article 4.1 shall
not be governed by the provisions of Article VI.

        4.5     The Private Working Interest Owners shall be free to export all

                           ARTICLE V - MINING LEASES

        5.1     Subject to the due performance of the terms and conditions of
this Agreement and upon proper application therefor being filed by the Operator
from time to time the PRESIDENT hereby agrees to grant to the Working Interest
Owners a Lease corresponding to each Commercial Discovery made within the
Subject Area during the term of the Licence.

        5.2     Each such Lease shall be issued as of the corresponding
Commercial Discovery Notice Date by undivided interests in the names of, and
shall obligate in accordance with their respective Proportionate Shares, all
Working Interest Owners hereunder, including the PRESIDENT as a Working Interest
Owner.

        5.3     Each such Lease shall cover such part or parts of the Subject
Area as the Operator may designate but not to aggregate less than ten (10)
square miles nor more than fifty (50) square miles.

        5.4     Each such Lease shall be granted for an initial term of thirty
(30) years, and with the approval of the PRESIDENT for another four (4) renewals
of five (5) years each; each such approval shall not be unreasonably withheld if
Commercial Production can reasonably be expected to continue into the succeeding
renewal period.

        5.5     Before each renewal takes place, the PRESIDENT and the Private
Working Interest Owners shall negotiate and revise the Lease in the light of
then prevailing circumstances.  The revised Lease which shall govern the
relationship between the Parties during the renewed period shall be based on the
most progressive features of agreements related to similar oil operations in
Pakistan and shall include the most advantageous to Pakistan of the terms and
conditions of such agreements, taking into account all other relevant facts and
conditions.

<PAGE>   11
                                      -9-

        5.6     The Working Interest Owners shall commence within the Concession
Year next following the granting of each such Lease, and subsequently continue,
such development operations under such Lease as are indicated by good oil field
practice.

        5.7     The Surrender at any time of any part or parts of the Subject
Area then retained which are covered by any Lease shall terminate such Lease and
shall excuse performance by the Working Interest Owners of any unaccrued
obligation under such Lease and any unaccrued obligation provided in the Act,
the Rules or this Agreement with respect to the area covered by such Lease.

        5.8     In the event the PRESIDENT declines to grant a Lease which the
Operator has applied for pursuant to Article 5.1, and in the further event that
the issue of the obligation of the PRESIDENT to grant such Lease is submitted to
arbitration as provided in Article XVII, then no Lease or other Petroleum rights
covering the area applied for by the operator shall be granted to any third
party until the final decision and award have been made in such arbitration.

                 ARTICLE VI - ASSIGNMENT, SURRENDER OF AREAS,
                         AND TERMINATION OF AGREEMENT

        6.1     No Private Working Interest Owner shall assign, encumber, or
otherwise dispose of all or any part of its Working Interest or any right to
future production corresponding thereto without the previous consent in writing
of the PRESIDENT and all other Working Interest Owners except as hereinafter
provided in this Article VI.

        6.2     Provided the proposed assignor gives written notice of the
proposed assignment to all Working Interest Owners and further provided the
PRESIDENT does not inform the proposed assignor in writing of the PRESIDENT's
objection thereto (which objection shall not unreasonably be made) within sixty
(60) days after such notice is given, such consent shall be deemed to have been
given.

        6.3     In determining whether to give his consent to any assignment,
the PRESIDENT shall take into consideration the nationality of the person to
whom assignment is to be made and such person's past experience and ability to
fulfill the obligations and responsibilities under this Agreement, the Licence
and any Leases granted pursuant to this Agreement.  The PRESIDENT may require as
a condition to giving such consent that the assignee at his expense, execute a
deed of covenant to observe and perform such obligations and responsibilities.

        6.4     In the event the PRESIDENT wishes to assign all or any part of
the Working Interest to a third party, the consent of the Private Working
interest Owners shall not be unreasonably withheld, taking into consideration
such proposed assignee's past experience and ability to fulfill the
responsibilities and obligations under this Agreement, the Licence and any
Lease.  The Private Working Interest may require as a condition of such consent
that the assignee, at his expense, execute a deed of covenant to observe and
perform such responsibilities and obligations.
                               
<PAGE>   12

        6.5     To the extent of any such assignment, the rights and privileges
granted to and the obligations assumed by the assignor under and pursuant to
this Agreement shall inure to the benefit of and be binding upon the assignee to
the exclusion of the assignor, provided that in the case of an assignment to an
Affiliate the assignor shall remain bound by such obligations unless released in
writing by all other Working Interest Owners.
                                                                    
        6.6     Any assignment covering less than an entire ten per cent (10%)
Working Interest shall not serve to increase the number of management
representatives provided for in the Operating Agreement and assignor and
assignee shall in such cases agree upon a single management representative to
represent their combined Working Interests.

        6.7     If the Private Working Interest Owners shall deem it advisable
to Surrender all or any part of the Licence or any Lease at the time when the
PRESIDENT owns any Working Interest therein the Private Working Interest Owners
shall notify the PRESIDENT in writing of the proposed Surrender.  If, within
thirty (30) days thereafter, the PRESIDENT notifies the Private Working Interest
Owners in writing that the PRESIDENT wishes to acquire the rights and
obligations of the Private Working Interest Owners in the Licence or Lease, or
part thereof, proposed to be Surrendered, the Private Working Interest Owners
shall, to the extent that they legally may, assign all rights and obligations
therein to the PRESIDENT in substitution for the Private Working Interest
Owners.  If no such written notification is given by the PRESIDENT, the Private
Working Interest Owners shall be free to Surrender such Licence or Lease, or
applicable part thereof, and the PRESIDENT (acting in the PRESIDENT's capacity
as a Working Interest Owner) shall join with the Private Working Interest Owners
in such Surrender.

        6.8     In the event a Surrender effected under Article 6.7 covers the
entire remaining Subject Area, the Licence and all Leases then outstanding, this
Agreement shall be terminated, and the Working interest Owners shall after such
Surrender have no further obligation under the Act, the Rules, this Agreement,
the Licence or any such Lease except for obligations which have accrued prior to
such Surrender.

        6.9     If no Commercial Discovery is made within the first seven (7)
Concession Years the PRESIDENT shall have the right to terminate this Agreement
and the Licence after giving one (1) year's notice to the Private Working
Interest Owners.

        6.10    Notwithstanding the provisions of Articles 3.8 and 6.9, the term
of this Agreement shall continue, and the obligation of the Working Interest
Owners to reduce the area of the retained parts of the Subject Area to nil shall
be postponed, until the completion or abandonment of any well being drilled at
the end of the seventh Concession Year and, in the event such well results in a
Commercial Discovery, thereafter until the corresponding Lease has expired.

        6.11    Upon the termination of this Agreement, the Licence, and all
Leases then outstanding each Working Interest Owner

<PAGE>   13
                                      -11-

shall be entitled to share in any unobligated and unexpended funds of the
Working Interest Owners to the extent of such Working Interest Owner's
contribution thereto.

        6.12    No consent shall be required for (a) the assignment to other
Working Interest Owners of a person's entire Working Interest or Petroleum
attributable thereto pursuant to the default and forfeiture provisions of the
Operating Agreement or (b) the transfer among Working Interest Owners of
disproportionate rights to Petroleum pursuant to the sole risk provisions of the
Operating Agreement.

                          under this Agreement shall be determined by
                          distilling a representative sample thereof in
                          accordance with the latest revisions of the
                          appropriate ASTM Test Method.  The yield quality
                          differential (plus or minus) shall be multiplied by
                          the average price of Arabian Light Crude Oil as
                          reported by Platt's Oilgram Price Service under the

                          component product fraction.

        7.2     Notwithstanding Rule 2, or any other provision of the Rules, the
wellhead value of Natural Gas and other gaseous substances whether produced in
association with Crude Oil or otherwise shall be calculated on the following
bases:

                (a)       If sold to a third party at the wellhead in its
                          natural state the basis shall be the gross amount
                          realized from such sale; or

                (b)       If sold to a third party not at the wellhead or not
                          in its natural state but after processing for sale,
                          the basis shall be gross amount realized from such
                          sale reduced by all transportation and other costs
                          incurred from the point of production (wellhead) to
                          the point of delivery to the buyer including but

                          not limited to the costs of gathering, transporting 
                          to processing facility, processing, compressing,
                          treating dehydrating, liquefying and purifying; or

                (c)       If used by the Working Interest Owners for purposes
                          other than the production and transportation of
                          Petroleum (which use is hereby expressly permitted
                          free of any royalty obligations), the basis shall be
                          the gross amount for which the Working Interest
                          Owners could have sold the Natural Gas or other
                          substance to a third party under the conditions of
                          (a) or (b) above, which gross amount shall be
                          determined on the basis of the most recent prices for
                          comparable Natural Gas or other substances sold
                          within Pakistan less applicable transportation 
                          and other costs.

        7.3     To facilitate computations the wellhead value for any Calendar
Quarter shall be determined within two (2) months after the end of such Calendar
Quarter, on a weighted average basis.  Crude Oil values shall be expressed on
the basis of barrels and Natural Gas on the basis of millions of British Thermal
Units (BTU's).

        7.4     The wellhead value calculated pursuant to this Article VII shall
be the basis for income and other taxation in Pakistan, for the assessment of
royalty, for the evaluation of Petroleum for purposes of reimbursing the Private
Working Interest Owners pursuant to Articles 4.1(a) and 4.1(b), and for the
purpose of all other contractual and legal relationships under this Agreement,
the Licence and any Lease.

                          ARTICLE VIII - NATURAL GAS

        8.1     If following a discovery of Natural Gas the Private Working
Interest Owners shall determine at any time that they do not wish to participate
in the development of the Natural Gas field or to maintain their rights therein
while waiting improved economic conditions, they shall so notify the PRESIDENT
in writing, and in that event the PRESIDENT shall have the right to develop the
Natural Gas field at the PRESIDENT's sole cost.  If the Private Working Interest
Owners desire to maintain their rights in the Natural Gas field while awaiting
improved economic conditions, but the PRESIDENT wishes to develop the Natural
Gas field forthwith, the PRESIDENT shall present to the Private Working Interest
Owners in writing all the PRESIDENT's reasons and evidence supporting immediate
development, and the Private Working Interest Owners shall have six (6) months
from the date of receipt of such reasons and evidence to elect whether they will
join the PRESIDENT in the immediate development of the Natural Gas field.  If
the Private Working Interest Owners elect not to join the PRESIDENT in the
development of the Natural Gas field, the PRESIDENT shall have the right to
develop the Natural Gas field

<PAGE>   16
                                      -14-

at the PRESIDENT's sole cost.  If the PRESIDENT proceeds to develop the Natural
Gas field at the PRESIDENT's sole cost, the Private Working Interest Owners
shall assign to the PRESIDENT their Working Interests in their rights to Natural
Gas fields under all Leases acquired or to be acquired in connection with the
Natural Gas field, without prejudice to the rights of the Private Working
Interest owners with respect to any other Petroleum deposit in the area covered
by such Leases.  The Private Working Interest owners shall have no liability for
obligations under such Leases which accrue after the date of such assignment,
unless there is another Commercial Discovery of Crude Oil under such Leases in
which case the Private Working Interest Owners shall remain liable for their
pro-rata share of such obligations.

        8.2     Notwithstanding the provisions of Article 8.1 the Working
Interest Owners may extract, take in kind and separately dispose of Casinghead
Petroleum Spirit obtained from Natural Gas by field distillation or similar
processes, and reinject into the producing formation Natural Gas remaining after
such extraction.  In such event (a) all Casinghead Petroleum Spirit so extracted
shall be accounted for on the same basis as Crude oil for the assessment of
royalty and for purposes of reimbursing the Private Working Interest Owners
pursuant to Article 4.1 and 4.2, and (b) the provisions of Article 8.1 shall
apply only to the Natural Gas which is so reinjected after the extraction of
such Casinghead Petroleum Spirit.

        8.3     The Working Interest Owners shall use their best endeavours not
to flare associated Natural Gas but to use it for recycling or another
commercial purpose. Any associated Natural Gas that would otherwise be flared
shall be offered to the PRESIDENT free of cost at the downstream flange of the
gas/oil separation facilities. If the PRESIDENT for whatsoever reason elects not
to take delivery of the associated Natural Gas at such flange the Working
Interest Owners shall have the right to flare such associated Natural Gas
without any liability until such time as the PRESIDENT elects to take delivery
thereof.  Any taking and disposition of such Natural Gas by the PRESIDENT shall
be effected in a manner which does not interfere with Crude Oil production or
transportation facilities.  The PRESIDENT shall bear all costs of gathering,
treating, compressing, transporting and processing such Natural Gas as is taken
by the PRESIDENT.

                   ARTICLE IX - RIGHT OF EXPORT OF PETROLEUM

        9.1     Notwithstanding Rule 39(a), Clause 58 of the Standard Form of
Oil Mining Leases, or any other provision of the Act or the Rules, the Private
Working Interest Owners shall have the right to export from Pakistan, free of
any export restriction, duty or tax, their respective Proportionate Shares of

Private Working Interest Owners under Article 4.1(a), and (c) Crude Oil required
to be sold for internal consumption within Pakistan as provided in Article 9.2.
The PRESIDENT shall issue or cause to be issued within a reasonable time any

                          Interest Owners in writing not later than six (6)
                          months in advance of each Calendar Year of the

                          (60%) of such Crude Oil so sold during each Calendar
                          Year shall be sold at international price.  In either
                          case the price shall be paid to the Private Working
                          Interest Owners in U.S. dollars or other freely
                          exchangeable currency within thirty (30) days after
                          the date of delivery to the purchaser.  As used in

                          Year, to sell pursuant to this Article 9.2 a greater
                          volume of Crude Oil than the proportion of the

representative that the well has been properly completed in accordance with good
oil field practices.

        23.3    The Private Working Interest Owners shall not knowingly sell

international operators in comparable areas.

        23.5    In connection with the sale and export of Crude Oil, the Private
working Interest Owners shall either use their respective tankers when

similar tankers on a free freight market basis at the moment the offer is made.

        23.6    So long as production of Petroleum programmed by the Working
Interest Owners is not unreasonably impaired, the PRESIDENT may use twelve and
one-half per cent (12-1/2%) of the field tank storage capacity owned jointly by
the Working Interest Owners hereunder for storage of royalty Petroleum (other
than Natural Gas and Casinghead Gas) free of charge.  If additional storage
capacity is available and is not required by the Working Interest Owners and is

<PAGE>   31
                                     -29-

utilized to store the PRESIDENT's royalty Petroleum, the PRESIDENT shall pay the
Working Interest Owners therefor at the current rate of storage in the oil
fields and, if there shall be no current rate established, then at a fair rate
to be agreed upon in the light of accepted oil field practice.  The foregoing
provisions of this Article 23.6 shall not apply to the storage of Petroleum
attributable to the PRESIDENT's Working Interest.

        23.7    All pipeline and Crude Oil terminal facilities owned jointly by
the Working Interest Owners hereunder shall be reserved for the transportation
