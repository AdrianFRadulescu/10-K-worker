                                    PART I

ITEM 1.  BUSINESS

GENERAL.    United Companies Life Insurance Company ("the Company"), domiciled
in  Louisiana  and  organized  in  1955,  is  currently  authorized to conduct
business in 47 states, the District of Columbia and Puerto Rico.   The Company
is a wholly-owned subsidiary of United Companies Financial Corporation ("UCFC"
or "Parent"), a financial services holding company with mortgage and insurance
operations.    The  primary  products  of  the  Company are deferred annuities
marketed  on a commission basis principally through financial institutions and
independent  general  agents  and  generally  sold  to middle income customers
seeking  tax  deferred  insurance  products,  primarily to provide savings for
retirement.    The Company added variable annuity products to its annuity line
of business during 1995 and began sales during the fourth quarter of 1995.

The  Company  produced $136 million, $250 million and $208 million in sales of
annuity  products  during  the  years  ended December 31, 1995, 1994 and 1993,
respectively.  At December 31, 1995, total annuity reserves were $1.4 billion.
At  December  31,  1995,  the invested assets of the Company consisted of $1.1
billion  in  investment  grade  fixed maturity securities (at amortized cost),
$168.9  million of home equity mortgage loans (which were primarily originated
by  its  affiliate,  United  Companies Lending Corporation ("UC Lending"), and
$167.4  million  of commercial mortgage loans (also primarily originated by UC
Lending).    At December 31, 1995, the weighted average rating of its publicly
traded  bond  portfolio  was  "AA,"  the  assets  allocated  to investments in
mortgage-backed  securities  were  $777.7  million  and  the  amount  of
non-investment grade publicly traded bonds in the portfolio was $22 million or
1.9%  of  the  portfolio.    During  the year ended December 31, 1995, the net
interest  spread on the Company's annuity business was 2.37% compared to 2.73%
for the same period in 1994.

Reserves  for  annuity policies constitute the Company's primary liabilities. 
The  duration  of  these  liabilities  is  affected  by  a  number of factors,
including  interest  rates, surrender penalties, ratings, public confidence in
the insurance industry generally and in the Company specifically, governmental
regulations  and  tax  laws.    Since  insurance  commissions  incurred at the
origination of annuity policies are generally deferred and recognized over the
estimated  life  of  the  policies,  any  unexpected increase in surrenders of
annuity  contracts  would  require  more  rapid recognition of these expenses,
thereby adversely impacting profitability.

In  the  second  quarter  of  1995, A.M. Best Company ("Best"), an independent
rating  organization,  reaffirmed its "A-" (Excellent) rating of the Company. 
The Company's claims paying ability, which has been rated "A+" (Single-A-Plus)
by  Duff & Phelps Credit Rating Company ("Duff & Phelps"), has been put on its
"Rating Watch-Uncertain" list as a result of the Parent's announcement that it
was  considering  strategic  alternatives  regarding  the Company, including a
possible  sale  thereof.    Duff  &  Phelps reported that the Company's claims
paying ability would remain on "Rating Watch-Uncertain" until more information
becomes  known about the Companys ultimate position within the organization or
another  organization.    See  "Recent Developments" and "Insurance Ratings." 
During  1995,  Standard  &  Poor's,  a  division of The McGraw-Hill Companies,
Inc.("Standard  &  Poor's"),  revised  the  rating scale used in assigning its
qualified  solvency  ratings  of insurance companies and, as a result, revised
its rating assigned to the Company from "BBq" to "Aq."

RECENT  DEVELOPMENTS.    On  February  2, 1996, UCFC signed a stock purchase
agreement dated as of January 30, 1996, for the sale of all of the outstanding
capital  stock  of  the  Company  to  UC  Life  Holding  Corp,  a new Delaware
corporation  formed  by  Knightsbridge  Capital Fund I, L.P., for $164 million
plus  earnings  of  the  Company  from  January  1,  1996,  to  closing of the
transaction.    Knightsbridge,  which is a private investment partnership with
institutional  partners,  was  formed  in  1995  to make equity investments in
companies engaged primarily in the life insurance industry.

Under  the  terms  of  the  agreement,  the  sales price is comprised of cash,
currently estimated to be $109 million, and real estate and other assets owned
by  the  Company  to  be  distributed  to UCFC prior to the closing.  The real
estate  to  be  distributed includes portions of the United Plaza office park,
including  UCFCs  home  office.  In addition, UCFC will purchase a convertible
promissory note from an affiliate of the purchaser for $15 million in cash.

The purchaser also agreed that the Company would continue to be an investor in
first  lien  home equity loans originated by UCFCs lending operations and that
the  Companys  home  office  operations  would  be  maintained  in its present
location  in  Baton  Rouge,  Louisiana  following the closing for at least two
years.    The  agreement  is  subject  to  approval  by UCFCs shareholders and
regulatory  authorities and the satisfaction of other conditions, and provides
that the closing will occur on or before July 31, 1996.

PRINCIPAL  PRODUCTS.    The principal products marketed by the Company since
1978  have  been  deferred  annuities.    During the year of 1995, the average
premium received on the sale of these policies was approximately $21,000.  The
annuities  typically guarantee an interest crediting rate for the first policy
year.    Thereafter,  the interest crediting rate generally may be adjusted by
the  Company at any time (subject to certain minimum crediting rates stated in
the  policy).  A policyholder is permitted at any time to withdraw all or part
of the accumulated premium plus the amount of interest credited on the policy,
less a surrender charge if applicable.  The initial surrender charge typically
ranges  from  9%  -  10% of the initial premium and decreases to zero during a
penalty  period of from five to ten years.  Approximately 78% of the Company's
annuity policies at December 31, 1995, were subject to a surrender penalty.

The  Company  produced  $136  million  and  $250  million  in sales of annuity
products during the years ended December 31, 1995 and 1994, respectively.  The
Company  believes that the decrease in annuity sales in 1995 is due in part to
the  interest rate environment, particularly the relative relationship between
short  term  and  intermediate  term  interest  rates, and to the focus of the
Companys  resources  on    development  of  the  variable annuity product.  In
addition,  a  financial institution which produced approximately 10% of UCLICs
annuity  sales  in  1994  discontinued the sale of annuities for UCLIC in 1995
subsequent to the merger of such financial institution.

The  interest earned on the annuity policy accumulates on a tax-deferred basis
until  withdrawal  by the policyholder.  The deferred annuity policies written
by  the  Company  generally provide a death benefit equal to the amount of the
initial  premium plus accumulated interest earned less the amount of any prior
withdrawals.

The  following  table presents the Company's annuity sales by state by percent
of total premiums for the periods indicated:

</TABLE>



No  other  state  individually  accounted  for  more than 7% of premium income
during 1995 or 1994.

DISTRIBUTION.    The  Company's  strategy  of  marketing  through  financial
institutions  and  independent  general  agents allows it to avoid substantial
sales  management  office  expense  and  to  expand  its sales efforts without
significant  development  expense.    Because  financial  institutions  and
independent  general  agents  usually  offer the products of several insurance
companies,  the  Company  must  continue  to provide products with competitive
terms, interest crediting rates, commissions and service to both policyholders
and  the selling institutions and independent general agents.  During 1995 and
1994,  the Company focused on expanding the independent general agent share of
its  distribution network.  Of the annuity policies sold during 1995 and 1994,
approximately  55%  and  46%,  respectively,  of  the total dollar amount were
attributable to sales by independent general agents.

REINSURANCE.  The Company generally limits the amount of insurance risk that
it assumes with respect to any one insured to $100,000 and for larger policies
follows  industry practice of reinsuring that portion of the risk in excess of
established  retention  limits.    The  Company, however, remains contingently
liable  for  insurance  ceded  to  reinsurers  and  remains  liable  to  the
policyholder  in  the  event  the  reinsurer is unable to meet the obligations
assumed  under  the  reinsurance  agreement.    Reinsurance is currently ceded
primarily  to the following companies: First Capital Life Insurance Company of
Louisiana  ("First Capital")(not affiliated with First Capital Holding Company
of  California), Aetna Life Insurance Company ("Aetna"), Continental Assurance
Company  ("Continental"),  American  United  Life Insurance Company ("American
United") and Transamerica Occidental Life Insurance Company ("Transamerica"). 
American United and Transamerica are rated "A+" (Superior) by Best at December
31,  1995.  Aetna and Continental are rated "A" (Excellent).  First Capital is
rated  "B"  (Adequate).    In  the case of First Capital, the dollar amount of
reserve  credit  taken  by the Company is held in trust for the benefit of the
Company.

LIFE  INSURANCE  AND  ANNUITY  RESERVES.    In  accordance  with applicable
insurance  regulations,  the  Company  records as liabilities in its statutory
financial  statements  actuarially  determined reserves that are calculated to
meet  future  obligations under outstanding insurance.  The reserves are based
on  statutorily  recognized  methods  using prescribed morbidity and mortality
tables  and  interest  rates.    Reserves  include  unearned premiums, premium
deposits,  claims  that  have  been reported but are not yet paid, claims that
have  been  incurred  but have not been reported, and claims in the process of
settlement.  The Company's reserves satisfy minimum statutory requirements.

The  annuity  reserves  reflected in the Consolidated financial statements are
calculated  based on generally accepted accounting principles ("GAAP").  As of
December 31, 1995, annuity reserves were $1.4 billion, policy benefit reserves
were $111.2 million, and unearned premium reserves related to credit insurance
were $1.8 million.  These reserves are based upon the Company's best estimates
of  mortality,  persistency,  expenses and investment income, with appropriate
provisions  for  adverse  statistical  deviation  and the use of the net level
premium  method  for all non-interest sensitive products and the retrospective
deposit  method  for  interest-sensitive  products.  GAAP reserves differ from
statutory reserves due to the use of different assumptions regarding mortality
and  interest  rates  and  the introduction of lapse assumptions into the GAAP
reserve calculation.  See Note 1 of Notes to Consolidated financial statements
for additional information regarding reserve assumptions under GAAP.

INVESTMENTS.    The  investment  function  of  the Company is overseen by an
investment  committee  comprised  of senior management, with the assistance of
outside  investment  advisors  in  the  management  of  certain  assets.   The
Company's  investment  policy  seeks to achieve attractive returns on a low to
moderate  risk  portfolio  of investments.  These investments, primarily bonds
and  mortgage  loans,  must  be  within  regulatory  constraints to qualify as
permitted  assets,  and  within  the  yield,  risk  and  maturity  limitations
established by the Company as necessary for meeting its objectives.

The  investment  strategy  continues to focus on maintaining the percentage of
the  Company's  invested  assets  committed  to  commercial  and  residential
mortgages  and  to  investment  grade  corporate  bonds  and  mortgage-backed
securities.

The  following  table  sets  forth,  at December 31, 1995, certain information
regarding the Company's invested assets:

(1)Fixed maturity investments are classified according to the ratings assigned by
Moody's Investors Service, Inc., or, in the absence of such rating, by the National
Association of Insurance Commissioners ("NAIC") whose ratings operate as follows: 
NAIC Class 1 was assumed equivalent to an A rating; NAIC Class 2, BBB/Baa; and NAIC
Classes 3-6, BB/Ba and below.
</TABLE>



As  a significant percentage of the Company's investment portfolio is invested
in fixed rate, fixed maturity investments, the fair value of these investments
is  sensitive  to  changes  in market rates of interest.  In a rising interest
rate  environment,  the  fair  value of these investments would be expected to
decrease  in  value.  An unanticipated increase in policy surrenders or claims
could  impact  the Company's liquidity and require the sale of certain assets,
such as bonds, prior to their maturity at a loss.

FIXED  MATURITY INVESTMENTS.  As of December 31, 1995, the amortized cost of
the Company's fixed maturity investments totaled $1.1 billion or approximately
72.2%  of  the  Company's  invested  assets.  The fair value of fixed maturity
investments  at  that  date exceeded its amortized cost by approximately $44.5
million.   In accordance with the provisions of Financial Accounting Standards
Board  ("FASB")  Statement  of  Financial  Accounting Standards No. 115 ("SFAS
115"),  the  Company  classifies  its  securities in one of three categories: 
"available-for-sale,"  "held-to-maturity"  or trading."  Securities classified
as  held-to  maturity  are  carried  at  amortized  cost,  whereas  securities
classified  as  trading  securities or available-for-sale are recorded at fair
value.    The  adjustment,  net  of  applicable  income taxes, for investments
classified as available-for-sale is recorded in "Net unrealized gains (losses)
on  securities"  and  is included in stockholder's equity on the balance sheet
and  the  adjustment for investments classified as trading is recorded in "Net
investment  income"  in the statement of income.  The Company may for business
or  regulatory reasons be required to sell certain of its investments prior to
maturity,  and  in  some  cases these sales may be made at times when the fair
value  is  less  than  carrying  value,  thereby  resulting  in  a loss in the
statements of income for financial and statutory reporting purposes.

At  December  31,  1995,  49.0%  of  the  Company's total invested assets were
invested  in  mortgage-backed  securities.    These mortgage-backed securities
consist principally of collateralized mortgage obligations and mortgage-backed
pass-through  securities.    Mortgage-backed  securities  generally  are
collateralized  by  mortgages  backed  by  GNMA,  FNMA  and  FHLMC.  Only GNMA
mortgages  are  backed  by  the  full  faith  and  credit of the United States
Government.    Certain  mortgage-backed  securities are subject to significant
prepayment  risk.    In  periods of declining interest rates, mortgages may be
repaid  more  rapidly  than  scheduled  as  individuals  refinance higher-rate
mortgages  to take advantage of lower interest rates.  As a result, holders of
mortgage-backed  securities may receive large prepayments on their investments
that  cannot  be  reinvested at an interest rate comparable to the rate on the
prepaid  mortgage.  In addition to decreased investment yields, earnings could
also  be  affected  by  capital  gains or losses realized on these prepayments
since  the carrying value of securities purchased at a discount or premium may
be  different  than  the  amount  received  upon  prepayment.  The Company has
reduced  the  prepayment  risk  associated  with mortgage-backed securities by
investing  in  planned  amortization  class  ("PAC")  instruments.    These
instruments  are  designed to amortize in a predictable manner by shifting the
primary  risk  of prepayment of the underlying collateral to other investors. 
PAC  instruments represented approximately 54% of the Company's investments in
mortgage-backed securities at December 31, 1995.
MORTGAGE  LOANS  ON  REAL  ESTATE.    At  December  31,  1995, the Company's
investment in mortgage loans on real estate was comprised of $168.9 million in
residential  home  equity mortgage loans and $167.4 million in commercial real
estate  mortgage  loans,  substantially  all  of  which  were originated by UC
Lending.  During 1995, the Company funded $21.3 million in new commercial real
estate  loans which were originated by UC Lending and refinanced $18.2 million
of  existing  commercial  real  estate  mortgage  loans.    The  mortgage loan
portfolio  of  the  Company  is  serviced by UC Lending.  The Company has full
credit  recourse  to UC Lending with respect to substantially all of the  home
equity  mortgage  loans  acquired  from  UC  Lending.    The  servicing of the
commercial  loan  portfolio will be transferred from UC Lending to the Company
under  the  terms  of  the  proposed  sale  of  the  Company.    See  "Recent
Developments" above.

The  Company  has  purchased  on an interim basis a substantial portion of the
first  mortgage  home  equity loans originated by UC Lending.  These loans are
typically held by the Company for short time periods (typically no longer than
90  days)  and  then  sold  back  to  UC Lending prior to their sale in public
securitization  transactions  by  an affiliate of UC Lending.  UC Lending, not
the  Company,  retains  the  contingent  credit  risk in connection with these
transactions.    A portion of the home equity loans are held by the Company in
its portfolio and are not sold by the Company to UC Lending.

Mortgage  loans  are  carried at amortized cost less valuation adjustments for
permanently  impaired  value where appropriate.  Commercial mortgages range in
size  up  to  approximately  $1.9  million  with  an  average  loan  size  of
approximately $.6 million.  At origination, substantially all of the mortgages
were  on  existing leased properties rather than on properties in construction
or  on  start-up  properties.    The  origination  of commercial mortgages was
subject to underwriting procedures, including: (i) maximum loan to value ratio
of  75%  of  the  property's  appraised  value;  (ii)  specified debt coverage
requirements;  (iii) on-site inspections; (iv) third-party appraisals; and (v)
personal  guarantees  of  borrowers.   For these reasons, the Company does not
consider  its commercial loans to be high risk.  The weighted average interest
rate  on the Company's commercial mortgage loan portfolio was 9.83% and 10.07%
at December 31, 1995 and 1994, respectively.

The  following  table provides information at December 31, 1995, regarding the
Company's commercial mortgage loans on real estate by property type, state and
contractual maturity (excluding loan loss reserves and discount):

INVESTMENT REAL ESTATE.  At December 31, 1995, the Company's investment real
estate  was  $32.4  million.    Investment  real  estate  included  two office
buildings,  adjacent  land,  and  related improvements utilized by its Parent,
other affiliates, and unrelated third party tenants.  In addition, it included
property  acquired  through  foreclosure  on  commercial  mortgage  loans.  At
December  31,  1995,  the Company owned $13.6 million of commercial properties
obtained  through  foreclosure.    For  substantially all commercial mortgages
which  the  Company has foreclosed, an independent appraisal was obtained and,
if warranted, the Company established a specific reserve based on its judgment
as  to  the amount which may not be recoverable.  As of December 31, 1995, the
specific reserve amounted to $4.0 million.  During 1995 the Company moved from
its  previous  home  office  property  into  an  office  building  owned by an
affiliate.
The  Company  also  establishes a general reserve for all commercial mortgages
where  a  specific  reserve  or  write-down  has  not been established.  As of
December 31, 1995, the general reserve amounted to $1.0 million.

INSURANCE  RATINGS.    The  ability  of  an  insurance  company  to  compete
successfully  depends in part on its financial strength, operating performance
and  claims-paying  ability  as  rated by Best and other rating agencies.  The
Company  is presently rated "A-" (Excellent) by Best.  Best's 15 categories of
ratings  for  insurance companies currently range from "A++" (Superior) to "F"
(In  Liquidation).    According  to Best, an "A" or "A-" rating is assigned to
companies  which,  in  Best's  opinion,  have  achieved  excellent  overall
performance  when compared to the standards of the life insurance industry and
generally  have  demonstrated  a  strong  ability to meet their obligations to
policyholders over a long period of time.  In evaluating a company's statutory
financial  and  operating  performance,  Best  reviews the company's statutory
profitability,  leverage  and  liquidity,  as  well as the company's spread of
risk,  quality  and  appropriateness  of  its reinsurance program, quality and
diversification  of  assets,  the adequacy of its policy reserves and surplus,
capital  structure  and the experience and competency of its management.  Best
ratings  are  based  upon  factors  of  concern  to  policyholders, agents and
intermediaries and are not directed toward the protection of investors.

On  October  24, 1995, Duff & Phelps placed its "A+" (Single-A-Plus) rating of
the  Company  on  Rating  Watch-Uncertain  because  of  the  October 20, 1995,
announcement  by  the  Company's  Parent    that  the  Parent  was considering
strategic  alternatives  regarding  the Company, including the pending sale of
the Company (see "Management's Discussion and Analysis of  Financial Condition
and  Results  of  Operations  -  Pending Sale of the Company").  Duff & Phelps
reported  that  the  claims  paying  ability  rating  would  remain  on Rating
Watch-Uncertain  until  more  information  becomes  known  about the Company's
ultimate  position  within the organization or another organization.  In 1995,
Standard  &  Poor's  revised  the rating scale used in assigning its qualified
solvency  ratings  of  insurance  companies  and,  as  a  result, revised  the
Company's rating from "BBq" to "Aq." Ratings such as those held by the Company
are  important to maintaining public confidence in the Company and its ability
to  market  its annuity products.  Any lowering of the Company's ratings could
materially  and adversely affect the Company's ability to market its products,
particularly  the  sale of annuities through financial institutions, and could
increase  the  surrender  of its annuity policies.  Both of these consequences
could,  depending upon the extent thereof, have a materially adverse effect on
the  Company's  liquidity  and,  under certain circumstances, net income.  The
Company  believes  that  its  present  ratings  will  enable it to continue to
compete successfully.

GOVERNMENT REGULATION AND LEGISLATION

GENERAL  REGULATION.   The Company is subject to regulation by the State of
Louisiana,  its  state of domicile, and the other states in which it transacts
business.    The  laws  of  such  states  are  designed  for the protection of
policyholders  rather  than  security-holders.    The Company is a member of a
holding  company  system  in  Louisiana.    All  transactions within a holding
company  system  affecting insurers must be both reasonable in relation to its
outstanding  liabilities  and adequate for its needs.  State laws also require
prior notice or regulatory agency approval of changes in control of an insurer
or  its  holding  company  and  of material intercorporate transfers of assets
within  the  holding  company  structure.   Generally, under insurance holding
company  statutes,  a  state  insurance  authority must approve in advance the
direct  or  indirect acquisition of 10% or more of the voting securities of an
insurance company chartered in its state.

The  laws  of  the  various  states  establish  regulatory agencies with broad
administrative  powers  to  approve policy forms, grant and revoke licenses to
transact business, regulate trade practices, license agents, and prescribe the
type and amount of investments permitted.  Insurance companies are required to
file detailed annual statements with the state insurance regulators in each of
the  states  in  which  they  do business, and their business and accounts are
subject  to  examination by such agencies at any time.  In addition, insurance
regulators  periodically  examine the insurer's financial condition, adherence
to statutory account practices, and compliance with insurance department rules
and regulations.

As  part  of  their  routine  regulatory  oversight  process,  state insurance
departments  conduct  detailed examinations periodically (generally once every
three  years)  of  the  books,  records  and  accounts  of insurance companies
domiciled  in  their  states.    Such  examinations are generally conducted in
cooperation with the departments of two or three other states under guidelines
promulgated  by  the  National Association of Insurance Commissions ("NAIC"). 
The  Company's last examination occurred during 1994 for the three year period
ended  December  31, 1993.  Final reports issued by the Louisiana Commissioner
of Insurance did not raise any significant issues or adjustments.

REGULATION AT FEDERAL LEVEL.  Although the federal government generally does
not  directly  regulate the insurance business, federal initiatives often have
an  impact on the business in a variety of ways.  Current and proposed federal
measures  that  may  significantly  affect  the  insurance  business  include
limitations  on  antitrust  immunity,  minimum  solvency  requirements and the
removal  of  barriers  restricting  banks  from  engaging in the insurance and
mutual fund business.

Congress  has  from  time  to time in the past considered possible legislation
that  would  adversely  affect  the  federal  income  tax treatment of certain
annuity  products  offered  by  the  Company.   There can be no assurance that
future  tax legislation will not contain provisions that may result in adverse
effects on the Company's products.

A  substantial  amount  of the Company's annuity policies are marketed through
financial institutions.  In a recent decision, the United States Supreme Court
upheld  the  United  States  Comptroller  of the Currency's decision to permit
national banks to sell annuities in towns with more than 5,000 inhabitants.

REGULATION  OF  DIVIDENDS  AND  OTHER  PAYMENTS.    As a Louisiana domiciled
insurance  company,  the Company is subject to Louisiana requirements relating
to  dividends  and  restrictions  on  payments  to  affiliates.  The Louisiana
Insurance Code (the "Code") provides that no Louisiana stock insurance company
shall declare and pay any dividends to its stockholders unless (i) its capital
is  fully  paid in cash and is unimpaired and (ii) it has a surplus beyond its
capital  stock  and  the  initial  minimum  surplus  required  and  all  other
liabilities  equal to 15% of its capital stock, provided that this restriction
shall  not  apply to an insurance company when its paid-in capital and surplus
exceed  the minimum required by the Code by 100% or more.  Additional dividend
restrictions  are  imposed  by  the Louisiana Insurance Holding Company System
Regulatory  Law  (the  "Insurance  Holding  Company  Law").    Specifically,
extraordinary dividends by insurance companies are subject to a prior approval
requirement  by  the  Louisiana  Commissioner  of  Insurance  (the  "Louisiana
Commissioner")  and  an  insurance  company's surplus as regards policyholders
following  any  dividends or distributions to affiliates must be reasonable to
the  insurance company's outstanding liabilities and adequate to its financial
needs.    An  extraordinary  dividend is defined as an amount in excess of the
lesser  of  (a) 10% of surplus as of the preceding December 31, or (b) the net
gain  from  operations for the preceding calendar year.  The Insurance Holding
Company  Law  also  subjects  all  transactions  between a Louisiana insurance
company  and  its affiliates to certain fairness and reasonableness standards,
and,  furthermore,  certain  types  of  transactions  with  its affiliates are
subject  to  prior  notice  to  the  Louisiana  Insurance Commissioner who may
disapprove  the transaction if it is determined that such transaction does not
meet  certain  fairness  and  reasonableness  standards or if it may adversely
affect the interests of policyholders.  If insurance regulators determine that
payment  of a dividend or any other payment to an affiliate (such as a payment
under a tax allocation agreement or for employee or other services or pursuant
to  a  surplus  debenture)  would,  because  of the financial condition of the
paying  insurance  company  or  otherwise,  be  hazardous  to  such  insurance
company's policyholders or creditors, the regulators may block payment of such
dividend  or  such  other  payment  to  the  affiliate that would otherwise be
permitted  without prior approval.  Under the current statutory and regulatory
scheme in Louisiana, the Company has, as of December 31, 1995, the capacity to
pay  dividends  of  $9.2 million.  No dividends were paid during 1993, 1994 or
1995 in order to retain capital in the Company.

INSURANCE  REGULATORY  CHANGES.    The  NAIC  and  insurance regulators have
undertaken  a  process of re-examining existing laws and regulations and their
application  to  insurance  companies.  In particular, this re-examination has
focused  on  insurance  company  investment  and  solvency issues and, in some
instances,  has  resulted  in  new  interpretations  of  existing  law,  the
development  of  new laws and the implementation of non-statutory guidelines. 
The  NAIC has formed committees to study and formulate regulatory proposals on
such  diverse  issues  as  the  use  of  surplus  debentures,  accounting  for
reinsurance  transactions and the adoption of risk-based capital rules.  It is
not  possible  to  predict  the  future  impact  of changing state and federal
regulation on the operations of the Company.

Statutory  filings  require  classifications  of  investments  and require the
establishment  of an Asset Valuation Reserve ("AVR") account which consists of
two  main  components:    a  "default  component"  to  provide  for  future
credit-related losses on fixed income investments and an "equity component" to
provide for losses on all types of equity investments, including real estate. 
The  AVR  at  December  31,  1995,  was  $20.9  million.  Also required is the
establishment  of  a  reserve called the Interest Maintenance Reserve ("IMR"),
which  is a reserve for fixed income realized capital gains and losses, net of
taxes,  related  to  changes  in  interest  rates.   The IMR is required to be
amortized  into  statutory earnings on a basis reflecting the remaining period
to  maturity of the fixed income securities sold.  The deferred realized gains
and  losses included in the IMR at December 31, 1995, was $2.7 million, net of
taxes.

INSURANCE  REGULATORY  INFORMATION  SYSTEM.    The  NAIC  has  developed the
Insurance Regulatory Information System ("IRIS") which involves calculation of
ratios  covering  eleven (11) categories of financial data with defined "usual
ranges"  for  each  category.    The ratios are designed to provide regulators
"early  warnings" as to when a given company might warrant special attention. 
The  Company  had  only two ratios outside the usual range in 1995.  These two
relate  to  the decrease in premiums in 1995 and the effect on reserves of the
continued run-off of the credit life business.

RISK-BASED  CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS.  The NAIC has developed risk-based capital
("RBC")  requirements for life insurance companies.  The formula, which is set
forth  in  instructions  adopted by the NAIC, is designed to take into account
asset  risks,  insurance  risks,  interest rate risks and other relevant risks
with  respect  to  the  insurer's business.  The NAIC has further provided for
categorization  of  life  insurance companies according to the extent to which
they  meet  specified  RBC  thresholds,  with increasing degrees of regulatory
scrutiny  or  intervention  provided for companies in categories of lesser RBC
compliance.    The  following  degrees  or  levels  of  regulatory  action are
triggered  by  certain  events  with respect to an insurer's RBC compliance as
follows:    (I)  a "company action level event" (requiring the insurer to file
and  obtain  approval of a comprehensive financial plan for the improvement of
its  RBC compliance): (ii) a "regulatory action level event" (resulting in, in
addition  to the requirement of a financial plan, regulatory actions including
examination of the insurer's assets, liabilities and operations followed by an
order  specifying  such  corrective actions as are determined to be required);
(iii)  an  "authorized  control level event" (resulting in, in addition to the
regulatory actions specified above, such actions as are necessary to cause the
insurer  to  be  placed  under  regulatory  control  under  the  applicable
rehabilitation  and/or  liquidation  statutes  if  deemed  to  be  in the best
interests  of  policyholders, creditors and the public): and (iv) a "mandatory
control  level event" (resulting in, on a mandatory basis, such actions as are
necessary to cause the insurer to be placed under regulatory control under the
applicable  rehabilitation  and/or  liquidation  statutes).    The  Company is
adequately  capitalized  under  the  RBC  requirements  and  believes that the
thresholds  will  not  have any significant regulatory effect on it.  However,
should the Company's RBC position decline in the future, its continued ability
to  pay dividends and the degree of regulatory supervision or control to which
it is subject may be affected.  At December 31, 1995, the Company's risk-based
capital ratio was approximately 229%.

ASSESSMENTS  AGAINST  INSURERS.    Guaranty  laws  exist  in all states, the
District  of Columbia and Puerto Rico.  Life insurers doing business in any of
these  regions  can  be assessed for policyholder losses incurred by insolvent
life  insurance  companies.  The amount and timing of any future assessment on
the Company under these laws cannot be reasonably estimated and are beyond its
control.    Regulatory  actions  against  life insurers encountering financial
difficulty  have  prompted  the  various state guaranty associations to assess
life insurance companies for the deemed loss.  A large part of the assessments
paid  by  the  Company  pursuant  to  these  laws may be used as credits for a
portion of premium taxes.

COMPETITION

As  a  marketer  of  annuity products, the Company faces intense competition. 
Competitors  include  an  increasing  number of insurance companies which have
begun  to  offer  annuity  products.    Many  of the Company's competitors are
substantially  larger  and  have  more  capital  and  other resources than the
Company.    Competition can take many forms including convenience in obtaining
an  annuity,  customer service, marketing and distribution channels as well as
crediting rates.

ITEM 2.  PROPERTIES

The  Company  owns  two  office  buildings  in United Plaza office park, Baton
Rouge,  Louisiana.    All  of one and part of the other building are leased to
affiliates  of  the Company.  The Company's executive offices are located in a
third  building  owned  by  an  affiliate,  from  which  the  Company  leases
approximately 30,000 square feet.  As part of the proposed sale of the Company
by  UCFC, the two office buildings in Baton Rouge will be distributed to UCFC,
while  the  Company  will continue to lease its executive office space from an
affiliate.    See "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition
and Results of Operations - Pending Sale of the Company."  Management believes
that  the  properties are adequately maintained and insured and satisfactorily
meet the requirements of the business conducted therein.

ITEM 3.  LEGAL PROCEEDINGS

The  nature of the Company's business is such that it is routinely involved in
litigation  and  is  a  party  to  or  subject  to  other  items of pending or
threatened  litigation.    Although  the  outcome  of  these matters cannot be
predicted,  management  of  the  Company  believes,  based  upon  information
available, that the resolution of these various matters will not result in any
material adverse effect on its Consolidated financial statements.

ITEM 4.  SUBMISSION OF MATTERS TO A VOTE OF SECURITY HOLDERS

(1)  During the first quarter of 1994, the Company implemented the provisions of FASB Statement of Financial
Accounting
Standards No. 115 ("SFAS 115"), which revised the method of accounting for certain of the Company's
investments.  Prior to
adoption of SFAS 115, the Company reported its investments in fixed income investments at amortized cost,
adjusted for
declines in value considered to be other than temporary, SFAS 115 requires the classification of securities
in one of
three categories: "available-for-sale," "held-to-maturity" or "trading securities."  Securities classified
as
held-to-maturity are carried at amortized cost, whereas securities classified as trading securities or
available-for-sale
are recorded at fair value.  Effective with the adoption of SFAS 115, the Company determined the appropriate
classification of its investments and, if necessary, adjusted the carrying value of such securities
accordingly as if the
unrealized gains or losses had been realized.  The adjustment, net of applicable income taxes, for
investments classified
as available-for-sale is recorded in "Net unrealized loss on securities" and is included in Stockholders'
equity and the
adjustment for investments classified as trading is recorded in "Investment Income" in the Statement of
income.  In
accordance with the provisions of SFAS 115, prior year investments were not restated.

ITEM  7.    MANAGEMENT'S  DISCUSSION  AND  ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND
RESULTS OF OPERATIONS
following  analysis  should  be  read  in  conjunction  with  the  Company's
Consolidated  financial  statements and accompanying notes presented elsewhere
herein.

United  Companies  Life  Insurance  Company  ("the Company") is a wholly-owned
subsidiary  of  United  Companies Financial Corporation ("UCFC"),  a financial
services  holding  company founded in 1946.  UCFC has mortgage operations that
are  focused  on  the  origination,  sale  and  servicing  of  first mortgage,
nonconventional, home equity loans; and insurance operations that are focused,
principally  on  the  sale  of  deferred annuities.  On February 2, 1996, UCFC
entered  into an agreement to sell all of the outstanding capital stock of the
Company, subject to approval of UCFC's stockholders and regulatory authorities
and  satisfaction  of  certain  other  conditions.    See "Pending Sale of the
Company" and Note 9 to Notes to Consolidated financial statements.

The  Company, a life insurance company domiciled in Louisiana and organized in
1955,  is  currently authorized to conduct business in 47 states, the District
of Columbia and Puerto Rico.  The primary products of the Company are deferred
annuities,  marketed  on  a  commission  basis  principally  through financial
institutions  and  independent  agents.  As of December 31, 1995, premiums for
these  annuities  averaged  approximately $21,000 per policy and are generally
sold  to  middle  income  customers  seeking  tax deferred insurance products,
primarily to provide savings for retirement.

The  Company's  deferred  annuity  policies  typically  guarantee  an interest
crediting  rate for the first policy year.  Thereafter, the interest crediting
rate  generally may be adjusted by the Company at any time (subject to certain
minimum crediting rates stated in the policy).  A policyholder is permitted at
any  time  to withdraw all or part of the accumulated premiums plus the amount
of  interest  credited  on the policy, less a surrender charge if applicable. 
The  initial  surrender charge is typically 9% - 10% of accumulated premium or
accumulated value, depending on the particular contract, and decreases to zero
during  a  penalty  period of from five to ten years. Approximately 78% of the
Company's  deferred  annuity  policies at December 31, 1995, were subject to a
surrender penalty.

The  interest  earned  on  the  annuity policies accumulates on a tax-deferred
basis  until  withdrawal  by the policyholder.  The deferred annuity contracts
written  by  the  Company  provide  a death benefit equal to the amount of the
accumulated  premium  and  interest  earned  less  the  amount  of  any  prior
withdrawals.

The  Company  has continued to focus its efforts on expanding its distribution
network  of  financial  institutions  and  independent  general  agents,  and
expansion of the independent general agents' share of the distribution network
has  been  a  primary  goal  since  1993.    Independent  general  agents sold
approximately  55%  of  the  total  dollar amount of annuities written in 1995
compared  to  46%  in  1994  and 20% in 1993.  Annuity sales in 1995 were $136
million  compared  to  $250  million  in  1994  and $208 million in 1993.  The
Company  believes that the decrease in annuity sales in 1995 is due in part to
the interest rate environment, particularly the relative relationships between
short-term  and  intermediate-  term  interest  rates  and to the focus of the
Companys  resources  on  development  of  its  variable  annuity  product.  In
addition,  a  financial  institution  which  produced approximately 10% of the
Company's  annuity  sales  in  1994  discontinued  the  sale  of the Company's
annuities in 1995, subsequent to the merger of such financial institution.

Fluctuations in and the level of interest rates directly impact the operations
of the Company.  The average spread on the annuity business was 2.20% in 1993,
and  increased to 2.73% during 1994.  This spread declined to 2.37% for 1995. 
This  decrease  can  be  attributed  to  the  more  favorable  interest  rate
environment  that  existed  in  1994  compared to 1995.  Surrenders of annuity
policies increased in 1995 and 1994 compared to the prior years due in part to
the reduction in interest rates on new and existing annuity contracts and to a
rising  interest  rate  environment  and  an increase in the number of annuity
contracts which were beyond the surrender penalty period.

The  Company has continued its efforts to improve the quality and liquidity of
its investment portfolio as the weighted average rating of the publicly traded
bond  portfolio  was  improved  from  "A"  to  "AA"  in  1992,  the  amount of
non-investment  grade  publicly traded bonds in the portfolio was reduced from
$86.7 million or 14.7% of the bond portfolio at the end of 1990 to $22 million
or  1.9%  of  the  portfolio  at  December  31, 1995.  The assets allocated to
investments  in mortgage-backed securities have increased from $218 million at
year-end  1990  to $777.7 million at December 31, 1995.  At December 31, 1995,
the  weighted  average  rating of the publicly traded bond portfolio was "AA,"
the  amortized  cost  of  assets  allocated to investments in investment grade
fixed  maturity securities was $345.6 million or 30.2% of the portfolio and in
investment grade mortgage-backed securities was $733.5 million or 64.0% of the
portfolio.  At December 31, 1995, the amortized cost of the Company's holdings
of non-investment grade traded bonds was $22 million or 1.9% of the portfolio.
  Invested  assets of the Company also include residential and commercial real
estate  mortgages  originated  and  serviced  by  United  Companies  Lending
Corporation ("UC Lending"), an affiliate.

The  annuities  sold  by  the  Company  are  monetary  in nature and therefore
sensitive  to  changes in the interest rate environment.  Profitability of the
Company  is  directly  affected  by  its ability to invest annuity premiums at
yields  above the interest crediting rates on the related policy liabilities. 
One of the primary financial objectives is to effectively manage this interest
spread  over  time  in  changing  interest  rate  environments.    This  is
accomplished,  in  part,  by adjusting the interest crediting rate paid on its
existing  and  new  annuity  policies.    During periods of declining interest
rates,  the  fair value of the Company's investments, primarily fixed maturity
investments, increases; however, yields earned on investments made during such
periods  decline.  In  contrast,  during periods of rising interest rates, the
fair  value  of  the  investment  portfolio  declines  and  the risk of policy
surrenders  increases.    An unanticipated increase in surrenders would impact
the Company's liquidity, potentially requiring the sale of certain investments
prior to their maturities, which may be at a loss.

Reserves  for  annuity policies constitute the Company's primary liabilities. 
The  duration  of  these  liabilities  is  affected  by  a  number of factors,
including  interest  rates, surrender penalties, ratings, public confidence in
the  insurance  industry,  generally,  and  in  the  Company,  specifically,
governmental  regulations  and tax laws.  Since insurance commissions incurred
at  the  origination of annuity policies are generally deferred and recognized
over the estimated life of the policies, any unexpected increase in surrenders
of  annuity  contracts would require more rapid recognition of these expenses,
thereby adversely impacting profitability.

RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 1995 COMPARED TO YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 1994

Net  income for 1995 was $8.0 million, compared to $5.9 million for 1994.  The
increase  in  net  income for 1995 resulted primarily from improved investment
results from the Company's interest in a limited partnership.

The  following  table  sets  forth  certain  financial  data  for  the periods
indicated:

</TABLE>


Net  investment  income  totaled  $123.1  million  on  average  investments of
approximately  $1.5  billion  for  1995,  compared to net investment income of
$114.4 million on average investments of approximately $1.4 billion during the
same  period  of  1994.  At December 31, 1995, the amortized cost of the fixed
income  portfolio totaled $1.1 billion and was comprised principally of $733.5
million  in  investment grade mortgage-backed securities and $345.6 million in
investment  grade bonds.  In addition, net income before income taxes for 1995
increased  $4.8 million as compared to 1994 by results from an investment in a
limited partnership.  At December 31, 1995, the weighted average rating of the
publicly traded bond portfolio, according to nationally recognized statistical
rating  agencies,  was  "AA."   During 1994, the Company established a trading
account  for a portion of its investment portfolio invested in common stocks. 
At  December  31,  1995,  the  carrying  value of investments in the Company's
trading  account  was $752,000 reflecting a $207,000 unrealized loss, which is
included in investment income for 1995.

Interest,  charges  and  fees  on  mortgage  real  estate loans decreased $5.3
million  during  1995 compared to the same period of 1994.  A reduction in the
holding  periods  of home equity loans acquired by the Company from UC Lending
was the primary reason for the reduction in interest charges and fees on loans
in  1995.    At December 31, 1995, the Company's mortgage loans on real estate
were  comprised  of  $168.9  million  in home equity mortgage loans and $167.4
million  in  commercial real estate mortgage loans, compared to $158.5 million
and  $153.0  million,  respectively  at  December 31, 1994.  The mortgage loan
portfolio  of  the  Company  is  serviced by UC Lending.  The Company has full
credit  recourse  to  UC Lending with respect to substantially all home equity
mortgage  loans  acquired  by it from UC Lending.  Although the Company, since
1991, had limited its investment in commercial real estate loans, the Company 
decided  in  1995  to  invest on a limited basis in new commercial real estate
loans, substantially all of which were originated by UC Lending.  During 1995,
the  Company  funded  $21.3 in new commercial real estate loans and refinanced
$18.2  million  of existing commercial loans.  The servicing of the commercial
loan  portfolio will be transferred from UC Lending to the Company pursuant to
the  terms  of  the  proposed  sale  of the Company.  See "Pending Sale of the
Company."

The Company estimates that non-accrual loans reduced mortgage loan interest by
approximately  $121,000 and $124,000 during the 1995 and 1994, respectively.  
Loans  are  placed  on  a non-accrual status when they are 150 days past due. 
During  the  year  ended  December 31, 1995, the average amount of non-accrual
mortgage  loans  owned  by  the  Company  was  $2.4  million,  compared  to
approximately  $2.6  million  during the same period of 1994.  At December 31,
1995,  the  Company owned approximately $7.2 million of commercial loans which
were  on  an  accrual  status,  but  which  the Company considers as potential
problem  loans,  compared  to  $7.6 million at December 31, 1994.  The Company
evaluates  each  of these commercial loans to estimate its risk of loss in the
investment and provides for such loss through a charge to earnings.

Investment  income  for  the  year  of 1995 was also reduced by $.9 million as
compared  to  the  same  period  of 1994 for the excess of the amortization of
prior  loan  sale  gains over the related pass-through income.  An increase in
the  amortization  of prior loan sale gains was the result of an adjustment in
the  estimated  prepayment  assumptions  of  certain  mortgage  loans.    This
adjustment  was  made  in  connection  with  the Company's evaluation which is
performed  as of each balance sheet date of the prepayment assumptions used in
calculating loan sale gains in relation to the current rate of prepayment, and
if  necessary,  revising  the  estimate using the original discount rate.  Any
losses  arising  from adverse prepayment experience are recognized immediately
while favorable experience is recognized prospectively.

Net  insurance  premiums  declined  approximately $2.9 million for the year of
1995  compared  to  the  same  period of 1994.  Net insurance premiums reflect
revenues  associated  primarily  with  pre-need  life  insurance  and  credit
insurance.   Management has chosen to focus on deferred annuities, its primary
product line, and on developing its variable annuity product introduced in the
fourth  quarter  of  1995,  and  thus new sales of pre-need life insurance and
credit  insurance  have  been  discontinued.    The decrease in premium income
reflects that decision.

Realized  investment gains and losses may vary significantly from year to year
since  the  decision  to  sell  investments  is  determined  principally  by
considerations on investment timing and tax consequences.  Realized investment
gains  and  losses  can also result from early redemption of securities at the
election of the issuer (calls) and changes in write-downs and reserves.

Realized gains (losses) were as follows for the indicated periods:

</TABLE>



Interest  on  annuity  policies increased $6.0 million in 1995 compared to the
same  period  of  1994,  primarily  as  a  result of a $70 million increase in
average  annuity  reserves.   However, annuity reserves decreased $8.2 million
during  1995  from 1994 primarily because of annuity surrenders.  As expected,
annuity surrenders increased in comparison with 1994, primarily because of the
current interest rate environment and the effect of policies no longer subject
to  surrender  charges.    Management  continues  to  aggressively  manage its
interest  spread  between earnings and crediting rates in an effort to balance
competitiveness  and  profitability  goals.    Average  renewal credited rates
ranged  from  5.60%  to  5.75% and 5.60% to 6.45% for years ended December 31,
1995 and 1994, respectively.

Net  insurance commissions for the year of 1995 increased by approximately $.1
million  from the same period of 1994.  Refunds of commissions on the unearned
premiums  of  the  Company's credit life business exceeded the net commissions
after  capitalization during a portion of 1994 and contributed to the increase
in  1995.    Commissions  paid  on  issuance of the Company's deferred annuity
products  are  generally  capitalized  as  deferred  policy  acquisition costs
("DPAC")  and amortized over the estimated life of the policy.  The accounting
method  prescribed  for  determining  the cumulative amount of DPAC requires a
regular  reevaluation  of  the  estimated present value of gross profits to be
earned  on  a  block  of  policies.   If, based on actual experience and other
information,  the estimate of the present value of gross profits significantly
changes,  either  positively  or  negatively, the cumulative amount of DPAC is
redetermined  and  the  resulting adjustment is charged against or credited to
income.    Factors  used  in determining DPAC include policy surrender levels,
policy  crediting  rates  and  investment  yields.    During 1995, the Company
capitalized  as  deferred policy acquisition costs approximately $11.9 million
in  commissions  paid  on sales of annuities, compared to $20.7 million during
1994.    Amortization  of commission expense on annuities capitalized in prior
periods was $11.0 million during 1995, compared to $9.5 million during 1994.

Amortization of DPAC decreased $.4 million in 1995 compared to 1994.  In 1995,
total  amortization  was increased by the impact of the increase in production
in  1994,  but was decreased by the reduction in amortization of the declining
credit  life  business.  In addition, the Company adjusted its assumptions and
related  factors  to bring them in line with current Company experience during
its annual review and updates.  Insurance benefits for the year ended December
31,  1995  decreased  $2.7 million, compared to the comparable period of 1994,
generally reflecting the run-off of credit life insurance.

Other  operating expenses, which include general insurance and taxes, licenses
and fees, increased approximately $1.1 during 1995, compared to the comparable
period in 1994. This increase is primarily attributable to the start-up costs,
including  legal  and  printing  expenses,  associated  with the Company's new
variable  annuity  product  introduced  in  the  fourth  quarter  of 1995, and
increased corporate expenses allocated from its Parent.

YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 1994 COMPARED TO YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 1993
- -----------------------------------------------------------------------

Net  income for 1994 was $5.9 million, compared to a net loss of $8.3 million 
for  1993.    The  increase  in  net income in 1994 resulted primarily from an
improved interest margin earned on annuities and a non-recurring $15.0 million
pre-tax  investment loss on preferred stock of Foster Mortgage Corporation, an
affiliate, in 1993.

Net  investment  income  totaled  $114.4  million  on  average  investments of
approximately  $1.4  billion  for  1994,  compared to net investment income of
$109.7 million on average investments of approximately $1.4 billion during the
same  period  of  1993.    Annuity sales of $250 million in 1994 set a Company
annual  sales  record,  was an increase of 20.2% over 1993, and contributed to
the  increase  in  funds  available for investment.  At December 31, 1994, the
amortized  cost  of  the  fixed  income portfolio totaled $1.1 billion and was
comprised  principally  of  $791  million  in investment grade mortgage-backed
securities  and $291 million in investment grade bonds.  At December 31, 1994,
the  weighted  average rating of the publicly traded bond portfolio, according
to  nationally recognized statistical rating agencies, was "AA."  During 1994,
the  Company  established  a  trading  account for a portion of its investment
portfolio invested in common stocks.  At December 31, 1994, the carrying value
of  investments  in  the  Company's  trading account was $679,000 reflecting a
$22,751 unrealized gain, which is included in investment income for 1994.

Interest, charges and fees on loans decreased $2.1 million in 1994 compared to
1993.  At December 31, 1994, the Company's portfolio of loans was comprised of
$159.1 million in first mortgage home equity loans and $175.6 million in first
mortgage  commercial  real estate loans, compared to $263.6 million and $209.3
million,  respectively,  in 1993.   The mortgage loan portfolio of the Company
is serviced by UC Lending.  The Company has full credit recourse to UC Lending
with respect to all home equity mortgage loans acquired by it from UC Lending.
  A  reduction  in  the  volume of and related holding periods for home equity
loans  acquired by the Company from UC Lending contributed to the reduction in
interest, charges and fees on loans in 1994.

The  Company  estimates  that non-accrual loans reduced mortgage loan interest
for  1994  and  1993  by  approximately  $124,000 and $420,000, respectively. 
During  1994, the average amount of non-accrual loans owned by the Company was
approximately  $2.6  million,  compared  to  approximately $8.1 million during
1993.    At December 31, 1994, the Company owned approximately $7.6 million of
commercial  loans  which  were  on  an  accrual  status, but which the Company
considered  as  potential  problem loans, compared to $8.1 million at December
31,  1993.    The Company evaluates each of these commercial loans to estimate
its risk of loss in the investment and provides for such loss through a charge
to earnings.

Net  insurance  premiums  reflect  revenues associated primarily with sales of
pre-need  life insurance and credit insurance.  Management has chosen to focus
on  deferred annuities, its primary product line, and on developing a variable
annuity  product to be introduced in 1995.  Therefore, the sale of credit life
insurance  was  discontinued in 1993.  The decrease in premium income reflects
that decision.

Realized  investment gains and losses may vary significantly from year to year
since  the  decision  to  sell  investments  is  determined  principally  by
considerations of investment timing and tax consequences.  Realized investment
gains  and  losses  can also result from early redemption of securities at the
election of the issuer (calls) and changes in write-downs and reserves.

Realized gains (losses) were as follows:

</TABLE>


Interest  on  annuity policies declined $3.0 million in 1994 compared to 1993,
as  the  result  of  a reduction in the average interest crediting rate on the
Company's  annuity  policies,  offset  by the impact of an increase in annuity
reserves.  Average annuity reserves were $1.4 billion during 1994, an increase
of  approximately  $117  million  from 1993.  In comparison with 1993, annuity
surrenders  increased in 1994, but were managed to a level less than expected,
notwithstanding the aggressive policy crediting rate strategy.

Net  insurance  commissions  for  1994 decreased by approximately $2.8 million
from  the  same  period of 1993.   This decrease was primarily attributable to
the  discontinuation  of  credit life insurance sales by the Company in 1993. 
Commissions  paid  on  issuance of the Company's deferred annuity products are
generally  capitalized  as  DPAC  and amortized over the estimated life of the
policy.    The  accounting  method  prescribed  for determining the cumulative
amount  of DPAC requires a regular reevaluation of the estimated present value
of  gross  profits  to  be earned on a block of policies.  If, based on actual
experience  and  other information, the estimate of the present value of gross
profits significantly changes, either positively or negatively, the cumulative
amount of DPAC is redetermined and the resulting adjustment is charged against
or  credited  to  income.    Factors  used  in determining DPAC include policy
surrender  levels, policy crediting rates and investment yields.  During 1994,
the  Company  capitalized  as  DPAC approximately $20.7 million in commissions
paid  on  sales  of  annuities,  compared  to  $13.7  million  during  1993.  
Amortization  of  commission expense on annuities capitalized in prior periods
was $9.5 million during 1994, compared to $5.6 million during 1993.

Amortization  of  DPAC  increased  $3.3 million in 1994, compared to 1993.  In
1994,  total  amortization  was  impacted  by  the  amortization  of the large
increase  in  production  from  1993.    In addition, the Company adjusted its
assumptions  and  related  factors  to bring them in line with current company
experience during its annual review and update.

Insurance  benefits  for  1994  decreased  $5.5  million,  compared  to  1993,
generally  reflecting  the run-off of credit life insurance, which the Company
discontinued in 1993.

Other  operating  expenses  for  1994  decreased  approximately  $1.4 million,
compared  to  1993.  Other operating expenses in 1993 included a non-recurring
$2.1  million  estimated  loss  in  connection with the termination of a third
party  administrative  contract for credit life insurance.  Personnel expenses
increased  approximately  $1.1  million  in  1994  compared  to 1993 primarily
because  of  an  increase  in  the  cost of the Company's employee benefit and
incentive  plans.    A  $1.2 million reduction in expenses in 1994 compared to
1993  also  resulted from an increase in acquisition expenses deferred as DPAC
in  1994 over 1993.  Assessments by state guaranty associations also increased
approximately $920,000 in 1994 over 1993.

ASSET QUALITY AND RESERVES

The quality of the Company's commercial loan and bond portfolios significantly
affects the profitability of the Company.  The values of and markets for these
assets  are  dependent  on  a  number  of  factors, including general economic
conditions,  interest  rates and governmental regulations.  Adverse changes in
such factors, which become more pronounced in periods of economic decline, may
affect the quality of these assets and the Company's resulting ability to sell
these assets for acceptable prices.  General economic deterioration can result
in  increased delinquencies on existing loans, reductions in collateral values
and  declines in the value of investments resulting from a reduced capacity of
issuers  to  repay  the  bonds.    The  Company has full credit recourse to UC
Lending  for  principal and interest on its home equity loans originated by UC
Lending.

Substantially  all  of  the  loans  owned by the Company were originated by UC
Lending,  with  the  home  equity loans being originated primarily through its
branch  (i.e.,  retail)  network  or  wholesale  loan programs.  The Company's
investment  in  mortgage  loans  on  real  estate  at  December  31, 1995, was
comprised  primarily of $168.9 million in home equity loans and $167.4 million
in commercial loans.

At  December 31, 1995, the contractual balance of loans serviced by UC Lending
for  the  Company  was approximately $338.7 million.  Included in the serviced
portfolio  are  the Company's commercial loans, a substantial portion of which
were  originated  in  the following states: Florida (22.1%), Georgia (19.2 %),
Colorado  (12.6%),  Virginia  (8.2%),  Tennessee  (7.3%),  Texas  (5.8%)  and
Louisiana  (5.2%).    No other state accounted for more than 5% by outstanding
principal balance of the Company's commercial real estate loan portfolio.  The
risk  inherent  in such concentrations is dependent not only upon regional and
general  economic  stability  which  affects  property  values,  but  also the
financial well-being and credit worthiness of the borrower.

Management  continues  to  emphasize  reducing the level of non-earning assets
owned by focusing on expediting the foreclosure process on its commercial real
estate  loans  and disposing of the properties on a timely basis.  The balance
of  foreclosed  loans  totaled $13.6 million at December 31, 1995, compared to
$19.3    million  at  December 31, 1994.  The Company can neither quantify the
impact  of  property value declines, if any, on its loans nor predict whether,
to  what  extent,  or  how  long such declines may exist.  In a period of such
declines,  the  rates of delinquencies, foreclosures and losses on loans could
be  higher  than  those  previously  experienced.  Adverse economic conditions
(which  may  or  may  not  affect  real property values) may affect the timely
payment  by  borrowers  of scheduled payments of principal and interest on the
home  equity  loans,  and,  accordingly  the  actual  rates  of delinquencies,
foreclosures and losses.

The  following table provides a summary of mortgage loans owned by the Company
which  are  past  due  30  days or more, and loans charged-off as of the dates

The  above  delinquencies  of  home  equity  loans  are covered by full credit
recourse  to  UC  Lending  except $.2 million, $.3 million, and $.7 million at
December 31, 1995, 1994 and 1993, respectively.  The Company, however, retains
the entire risk associated with its commercial real estate loans.

The  Company  owns senior and subordinated pass-through certificates issued in
1990  for  commercial mortgage loans previously owned by the Company for which
an  election  has  been made under the real estate mortgage investment conduit
provisions  of  the  Internal  Revenue Code of 1986, as amended ("the Code"). 
These  certificates  are  included  in  bonds in the accompanying consolidated
financial  statements.  The outstanding principal balance of all of the senior
and  subordinated certificates was $46.8 million as of December 31, 1995.  The
principal  balance  of the subordinated certificates at December 31, 1995, all
of which were owned by the Company, was $26.5 million.  Losses associated with
defaults  and  related foreclosures which may occur on the loans backing these
pass-through  certificates  first  reduce  the  principal  balance  of  the
subordinated  certificates.   The losses resulting from such foreclosures were
$1.7  million,  $2.5 million, and $.8 million, for the periods ending December
31, 1995, 1994 and 1993, respectively.

The  Company provides an estimate for future credit losses in an allowance for
losses.    A  summary  analysis  of the changes in the Company's allowance for
losses for the indicated periods is as follows:

(1) The provision for real estate losses relate to losses from properties acquired in satisfaction of debt.

</TABLE>


At  December  31,  1995  and  1994,  the Company owned $13.6 million and $19.3
million,  respectively, of property acquired in settlement of loans, excluding
the specific reserves attributed to these properties, which is included in the
Company's  allowance  for  loan  losses  to reduce the carrying value of these
properties to their market value.Company's fixed maturity securities portfolio
consists  primarily  of  mortgage-backed  securities  and  corporate  bonds,
comprising  67.9%  and  29.3%  of  the  portfolio  at  December  31,  1995,
respectively.    Investment  purchases  are made with the intention of holding
fixed  maturity  securities  until  maturity.    Prior  to  January  1,  1994,
securities  were generally carried at cost adjusted for discount accretion and
premium  amortization.    At  December  31,  1995,  the  amortized cost of the
Company's  fixed  maturity portfolio was $1.1 billion, consisting primarily of
$777.7  million  in mortgage-backed securities and $335.2 million in corporate
bonds.    At  December 31, 1995, bonds with an amortized cost of approximately
$1.1  billion or 95.6% of the Company's portfolio of fixed maturity securities
were  classified  in  an  available-for-sale  category  and the carrying value
adjusted to fair value by means of an adjustment to stockholder's equity.  The
remainder of the portfolio consists primarily of private placement investments
traded directly and are classified as held-to-maturity and valued at cost.  At
December  31,  1995,  the  Company  owned  $0.8  million  in equity securities
classified  as  trading  securities.    The pre-tax net unrealized gain in the
available-for-sale  fixed  maturity  and  equity  portfolio  (fair  value over
amortized cost) at December 31, 1995, was $45.4 million, compared to a pre-tax
unrealized loss of $72.1 million at December 31, 1994.

The  Company  has  an  investment  in  certain limited partnerships which were
formed  for  the  purpose  of  participating  in  privately  placed  mezzanine
investments.    These  investments  generally include higher risk subordinated
debt  combined  with  equity  securities.   The partnerships are carried on an
equity basis at $25.6 million and $26.7 million at December 31, 1995 and 1994,
respectively.    Income  attributable  to  the  partnerships for 1995 was $6.3
million and $1.5 million for 1994.

LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES

The  Company's  principal  cash requirements consist of funding the payment of
policyholder  claims and surrenders.  Liquidity requirements for the Company's
operations  are generally met by funds provided from the sale of annuities and
cash flow from its investments in fixed income securities and mortgage loans.

Net  cash  flow  from  annuity  operations  is  used  to  build  the Company's
investment portfolio, which in turn produces future cash flows from investment
income  and  provides  a  secondary source of liquidity.  Net cash provided by
operating  activities  for  1995  and 1994 was approximately $88.4 million and
$62.6  million,  respectively,  resulting  primarily  from  cash  earnings  on
investments.    The  Company  monitors  available cash and cash equivalents to
maintain  adequate  balances  for  current  payments  while  maximizing  cash
available  for  longer  term  investment  activities.  The Company's financing
activities  during  the  years  ended  December 31, 1995 and 1994 reflect cash
received  primarily  from  sales  by  the  Company  of its annuity products of
approximately  $135.3  million  and $249.7 million, respectively.  The Company
believes  that  the  decrease  in  annuity  sales in 1995 compared to the same
period  of  1994 is due in part to the interest rate environment, particularly
the  relative  relationship  between short term and intermediate term interest
rates,  and  to  the  focus  of  the Company's resources on development of its
variable annuity product.  In addition, a financial institution which produced
approximately 10% of the Company's annuity sales in 1994 discontinued the sale
of annuities of the Company in 1995 subsequent to the merger of such financial
institution.  As reflected in the net cash used by investing activities during
the  same  periods,  investment purchases, which include loans purchased on an
interim  basis  from UCLC, were approximately $1.34 billion and $1.20 billion,
respectively, reflecting the investment of these funds and the reinvestment of
proceeds  from  maturities  of  investment.  Cash used by financing activities
during  1995  and  1994  also  reflects  payments of $222.8 million and $191.8
million,  respectively,  primarily  on  annuity  products  resulting  from
policyholder surrenders and claims.  The increase in annuity surrenders during
1995  was  expected,  due  in  part  to  an  increase in the amount of annuity
policies  which  were  beyond  the surrender penalty period and to the general
interest  rate  environment  during  this  period.  The interest margin on the
Company's  annuity  liabilities  during  the  year ended December 31, 1995 was
2.37%  compared  to  2.73%  during  the  same  period of 1994.  Investments at
December  31,  1995,  included approximately $336.3 million in home equity and
commercial  mortgage  loans,  and  the  amortized  cost  of the bond portfolio
included  $367.5  million  in  corporate and government bonds and private debt
placements and $777.7 million in mortgage-backed securities.

The  investment  portfolio  is  also  managed to provide a secondary source of
liquidity as investments can be sold, if necessary, to fund abnormal levels of
policy  surrenders,  claims  and  expenses.    An  unanticipated  increase  in
surrenders  would  impact  the  Company's liquidity, potentially requiring the
sale  of  certain  assets, such as bonds and loans, prior to their maturities,
which may be at a loss.

Reserves for annuity policies comprise the primary liabilities of the Company.
  The  Company believes it has established adequate reserves on these products
as  well  as  on  its  other  insurance products.  The effective life of these
liabilities  is  influenced  by a number of factors, including interest rates,
surrender  penalties,  ratings,  public  confidence  in the insurance industry
generally,  and  in the Company specifically, governmental regulations and tax
laws.    The  Company  employs an actuarial model to measure the interest rate
sensitivity  of  these  liabilities  to assist in the selection of assets with
appropriate characteristics.

The  Company  is  a  Louisiana  domiciled  insurance company, and, as such, is
subject  to  certain regulatory restrictions on the payment of dividends.  The
Louisiana  statutes  allow  payments  of dividends without the approval of the
commissioner   to the extent of the lesser of ten percent of surplus as of the
prior  year  end,  or the current year's net gain from operations. At December
31,  1995,  the  Company  could  to pay dividends of $9.2 million without such
approval.    No  dividends  were  paid  during 1995 or 1994 in order to retain
capital in the Company.

RATINGS

In  the  second  quarter  of  1995, A.M. Best Company ("Best"), an independent
rating  organization,  reaffirmed its "A-" (Excellent) rating of the Company. 
Best's  ratings  depend  in  part  on  its  analysis of an insurance company's
financial  strength,  operating  performance  and  claims  paying  ability  In
addition,  the  Company's  claims  paying  ability  has  been  rated  "A+"
(Single-A-Plus)  by Duff & Phelps Credit Rating Company ("Duff & Phelps").  On
October  24,  1995, Duff & Phelps placed its "A+" rating of the Company on its
Rating  Watch-Uncertain  list because of the October 20, 1995, announcement by
the  Company's  Parent  that  strategic  alternatives which it was considering
included  the  pending  sale of the Company (see "Pending Sale of the Company"
below).    Duff  & Phelps reported that the claims paying ability rating would
remain  on  Rating  Watch-Uncertain until more information becomes known about
the  Company's  ultimate  position  within  the  organization  or  another
organization.    In  1995,  Standard  &  Poor's, a division of The McGraw-Hill
Companies,  Inc.  revised  the  rating  scale  used in assigning its qualified
solvency  ratings  of  insurance  companies  and,  as  a  result,  revised the
Company's rating from "BBq" to "Aq." Ratings such as those held by the Company
can affect the Company's ability to market its annuity products.  Any lowering
of  the  Company's ratings could materially and adversely affect the Company's
ability  to  market  its  products, particularly the sale of annuities through
financial  institutions,  and  could  increase  the  surrender  of its annuity
policies.    Both  of  these  consequences  could,  depending  upon the extent
thereof,  have  a  materially  adverse  effect on the Company's liquidity and,
under  certain  circumstances,  net  income.    The  Company believes that its
ratings will enable it to continue to compete successfully.

PENDING SALE OF THE COMPANY

On  February  2,  1996,  UCFC  signed  a  stock purchase agreement dated as of
January  30, 1996, for the sale of all of the outstanding capital stock of the
Company    to  UC  Life  Holding  Corp.,  a new Delaware corporation formed by
Knightsbridge  Capital Fund I, L.P. ("Knightsbridge"), for an aggregate amount
of  $164 million plus earnings of the Company from January 1, 1996, to closing
of  the transaction.  Knightsbridge, which is a private investment partnership
with  institutional partners, was formed in 1995 to make equity investments in
companies engaged primarily in the life insurance industry.

Under  the  terms  of  the  agreement,  the  sales price is comprised of cash,
currently estimated to be $109 million, and real estate and other assets owned
by  the  Company  to  be  distributed  to UCFC prior to the closing.  The real
estate  to  be  distributed includes portions of the United Plaza office park,
including  UCFC's  home office.  In addition, UCFC will purchase a convertible
promissory note from an affiliate of the purchaser for $15 million in cash.

The purchaser also agreed that the Company would continue to be an investor in
first  lien home equity loans originated by UCFC's lending operations and that
the  home  office  operations  would  be maintained in its present location in
Baton  Rouge,  Louisiana  following  the  closing for at least two years.  The
agreement  is  subject  to  approval  by  UCFC's  shareholders  and regulatory
authorities  and  the  satisfaction of other conditions, and provides that the
closing will occur on or before July 31, 1996.

and  1994,  and  the  related consolidated statements of income, stockholder's
equity,  and  cash  flows  for  each  of  the  three years in the period ended
December 31, 1995.  Our audits also included the financial statement schedules
listed  in  the  Index  at  Item 14.  These financial statements and financial
statement  schedules  are the responsibility of the Company's management.  Our
responsibility  is  to  express  an  opinion  on  the financial statements and
financial statement schedules based on our audits.

We  conducted  our  audits  in  accordance  with  generally  accepted auditing
standards.    Those  standards  require  that we plan and perform the audit to
obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of
material misstatement.  An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence
supporting  the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements.  An audit
also  includes  assessing  the  accounting  principles  used  and  significant
estimates  made  by  management,  as  well as evaluating the overall financial
statement presentation.  We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis
for our opinion.

In  our opinion, such consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all
material  respects,  the financial position of United Companies Life Insurance
Company  and  its subsidiary at December 31, 1995 and 1994, and the results of
their  operations  and  their  cash  flows  for each of the three years in the
period  ended  December  31,  1995  in  conformity  with  generally  accepted
accounting  principles.    Also,  in  our  opinion,  such financial statements
schedules,  when  considered  in  relation to the basic consolidated financial
statements  taken  as  a  whole,  present  fairly in all material respects the
information set forth therein.

            UNITED COMPANIES LIFE INSURANCE COMPANY AND SUBSIDIARY
                  NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
             FOR THE YEARS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 1995, 1994 AND 1993


1.  ACCOUNTING POLICIES

1.1    Principles  of  Consolidation.  The consolidated financial statements
include  United  Companies  Life  Insurance  Company  (the  "Company") and its
wholly-owned  subsidiary,  United  Variable  Services,  Inc.   All significant
intercompany  balances  and  transactions  have  been  eliminated  in  the
consolidated financial statements.

1.2  Organization.  United Companies Life Insurance Company (the "Company") is
a wholly-owned subsidiary of United Companies Financial Corporation ("UCFC" or
the  "Parent"),  a  financial  services holding company founded in 1946.  UCFC
focuses  on  the  origination,  sale  and  servicing  of  first  mortgage,
nonconventional, home equity loans and insurance.

The  Company, a life insurance company domiciled in Louisiana and organized in
1955,  is  currently authorized to conduct business in 47 states, the District
of  Columbia  and  Puerto  Rico.   The primary products of the Company are tax
deferred  annuity  contracts  marketed  to  individuals  principally  through
financial institutions and independent agents.

1.3  Investments.

1.3(a)    Fixed  Maturity  and Equity Securities.  During the first quarter of
1994, the Company implemented the provisions of Financial Accounting Standards
Board  ("FASB")  Statement  of  Financial  Accounting Standards No. 115 ("SFAS
115"),  which  revised  the  method of accounting for certain of the Company's
investments.    Prior  to  adoption  of  SFAS  115,  the  Company reported its
investments  in  fixed  income  investments  at  amortized  cost, adjusted for
declines  in  value  considered to be other than temporary.  SFAS 115 requires
the  classification  of  securities  in  one  of  three  categories:
"available-for-sale,"  "held-to-maturity" or "trading."  Securities classified
as  held-to-maturity  are  carried  at  amortized  cost,  whereas  securities
classified  as  trading  securities or available-for-sale are recorded at fair
value.  Effective  with  the  adoption of SFAS 115, the Company determined the
appropriate  classification of its investments and, if necessary, adjusted the
carrying  value of such securities, accordingly, as if the unrealized gains or
losses had been realized.  The adjustment, net of applicable income taxes, for
investments  classified  as  available-for-sale is recorded in "Net unrealized
gains  (losses)  on securities" and is included in stockholder's equity on the
balance  sheet.    The  adjustment  for  investments  classified as trading is
recorded in "Net investment income" in the statement of income.  In accordance
with the provisions of SFAS 115, prior year investments were not restated.

1.3(b)    Mortgage Loans on Real Estate.  Loans are carried at amortized cost,
net  of  an  allowance  for  losses.   The Company provides for estimated loan
losses  on  loans  owned  by the Company by establishing an allowance for loan
losses through a charge to earnings.  The Company conducts periodic reviews of
the  quality  of  the loan portfolio and estimates the risk of loss based upon
historical  loss  experience,  prevailing  economic  conditions,  estimated
collateral  value  and such other factors which, in management's judgment, are
relevant  in  estimating  the  adequacy  of  the  Company's allowance for loan
losses.    While  management uses the best information available in conducting
its  evaluation, future adjustments to the allowance may be necessary if there
are  significant  changes  in  economic  conditions, collateral value or other
elements used in conducting the review.

1.3(c)   Investment Real Estate.  The Company's investments in real estate are
comprised  of  properties  received  in  settlement  of  loans  ("foreclosed
properties") and two office buildings, adjacent land, and related improvements
(its  former home office property).  The Company records foreclosed properties
at  the lower of their market value less estimated costs to sell ("market") or
the  outstanding  loan  amount  plus  accrued  interest ("cost").  The Company
accomplishes  this  by providing a specific reserve, on a property by property
basis, for the difference between market and cost.  Market value is determined
by  property  appraisals  performed  either by its affiliate, United Companies
Lending  Corporation  ("UCLC"),  or  independent  appraisers.    The  related
adjustments are included in the Company's provision for loan losses.

During  1995,  the  Company  moved its offices from its previous location, and
converted  One  and  Two  United Plaza to investment real estate.  One and Two
United  Plaza  are  leased  primarily  by  the Company to its Parent and other
affiliates.    One  and  Two  United Plaza are stated at cost less accumulated
depreciation.    Depreciation is computed on the straight-line method over its
estimated useful life.

1.3(d)  Policy Loans.  Policy loans are reported at unpaid principal balance.

1.3(e)    Investment  in  Limited  Partnerships.   The Company's investment in
limited  partnerships,  whose  affairs  are  not controlled by the Company, is
reflected on the equity method.

1.3(f)   Short-term Investments.  At December 31, 1995, short-term investments
totaled  $22.8  million bearing interest rates ranging from 5.25% to 5.61% per
annum.

1.4    Investment  in  Indebtedness of Affiliate.  The Company has invested in
three subordinated debentures of an affiliate, which are carried at cost.

1.5    Deferred Policy Acquisition Costs.  Commissions and other costs related
to  the  production  of  new  and  renewal  business  have been deferred.  The
deferred  costs  related  to traditional life insurance are amortized over the
premium  payment  period  using  assumptions  consistent  with  those  used in
computing  policy  benefit  reserves.  Deferred costs related to annuities and
interest  sensitive  products  are  amortized  over  the estimated life of the
policy  in  relation  to  the  present value of estimated gross profits on the
contract.  The Company periodically reviews the appropriateness of assumptions
used  in  calculating  the  estimated gross profits on annuity contracts.  Any
change  required  in these assumptions may result in an adjustment to deferred
policy acquisition costs which would affect income.

1.7  Property-Net.  Property is stated at cost less accumulated depreciation. 
Depreciation is computed on the straight-line and accelerated methods over the
estimated useful lives on the assets.

1.8    Policy  Benefit Reserves.  Policy benefit reserves for traditional life
insurance  policies have been provided on a net level premium method including
assumptions  as  to  investment  yield, mortality and withdrawals based on the
Company's  experience  and  industry  standards  with  provisions for possible
adverse  deviation.   Investment yield assumptions range from 5.5% to 8.5% per
annum.  Policy  benefit  reserves  include certain deferred profits on limited
payment  policies.    These  profits  are  being recognized in income over the
policy term.

Reserves  for  annuity policies and interest sensitive life policies represent
the  policy  account  balance,  or  accumulated  fund value, before applicable
surrender  charges.    Benefit  claims  incurred  in  excess of related policy
account  balances  and  interest  credited during the period to policy account
balances are charged to expense.

1.9  Repurchase agreements.  At December 31, 1995, the Company had a liability
of  approximately  $40.9  million  incurred  pursuant to securities sold under
agreements to repurchase ("repurchase agreements").  The securities sold under
these  agreements are classified as "Available-for-sale" investment securities
and  are  carried at their aggregate market value of $42.2 million at December
31,  1995.    The  repurchase  agreements bear interest at 5.70% and 5.74% and
matured in January, 1996.

1.10    Income  Taxes.    The  Company files a consolidated federal income tax
return  with  its Parent and other affiliated companies.  The Parent allocates
to  the  Company  its  proportionate  share of the consolidated tax liability 
under  a  tax allocation agreement whereby each affiliate's federal income tax
provision  is  computed on a separate return basis.  Deferred income taxes are
provided  for  the  effect  of  revenues  and  expenses  which are reported in
different  periods  for  financial  reporting purposes than for tax purposes. 
Such  differences  result  primarily  from deferring policy acquisition costs,
providing  for  bond,  real  estate  and  and  loan losses, differences in the
methods of computing reserves, and depreciation.

1.11   Premiums.  Income on short duration single premium contracts, primarily
credit  insurance  products, is recognized over the contract period.  Premiums
on  other  insurance  contracts  principally  traditional  life  insurance and
limited payment life insurance policies, are recognized as revenue when due.

1.12    Reinsurance.    The  Company  generally reinsures with other insurance
companies  the  portion  of  any  one risk which exceeds $100,000.  On certain
types  of  policies this limit is $25,000.  The Company is contingently liable
for  insurance  ceded  to  reinsurers.    Premiums  ceded  under  reinsurance
agreements  were $1.7 million, $2.1 million and $3.6 million in 1995, 1994 and
1993, respectively.  Reserve credit taken under reinsurance agreements totaled
$32.9  million, $34.0 million and $35.2 million at December 31, 1995, 1994 and
1993, respectively.

The Company has assumed the following reinsurance from other insurers:

</TABLE>


The  Company  has  a  receivable  at  December 31, 1995 of approximately $33.9
million  from  one reinsurer; however, the funds supporting the receivable are
escrowed  in  a  separate  trust account for the benefit of the Company by the
reinsurer.   The following table reflects the effect of reinsurance agreements
on premiums and the amounts earned for the periods indicated.

1.13    Participating  Policies.    Direct  participating  business, primarily
related to the Company's pre-need funeral policies, represented 8.2%, 7.2% and
6.3%  of  the  life insurance in force as of December 31, 1995, 1994 and 1993,
respectively.  The amount of dividends paid on participating policies is based
on  published  dividend scales and totaled $1.2 million, $1.0 million and $1.5
million for the years ended December 31, 1995, 1994 and 1993, respectively.

1.14    Accounting Standards.  In May, 1993 and in October, 1994, respectively
the  FASB issued Statements of Financial Accounting Standards Nos. 114 and 118
("SFAS  114"  and  "SFAS  118")  which address the accounting by creditors for
impairment  of  loans  and specify how allowances for credit losses related to
certain  loans  should  be  determined.    The  statements  also  address  the
accounting by creditors for all loans that are restructured in a troubled debt
restructuring  involving  modification  of  terms  of  a  receivable.    The
implementation  of  the  provisions  of    SFAS  114 and SFAS 118 in the first
quarter  of 1995 did not have a material effect on the financial statements of
the Company.

1.15  Use of Estimates.  The preparation of financial statements in conformity
with  generally  accepted  accounting  principles  requires management to make
estimates  and  assumptions  that  affect  the  reported amounts of assets and
liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of
the  financial  statements  and  the reported amounts of revenues and expenses
during  the  reporting  period.    Actual  results  could  differ  from  those
estimates.

1.16  Reclassifications.  Certain prior year amounts have been reclassified to
conform  with  the  current  year presentation.  Such reclassifications had no
effect on net income.

2.  INVESTMENTS

Net  unrealized  gains  on  available-for-sale  securities  of  $29.5  million
included  in  Stockholder's  equity at December 31, 1995, are presented net of
deferred  income  taxes  of  $15.9  million.    Net unrealized losses of $46.8
million  at  December  31,  1994,  were  net of deferred income taxes of $25.2
million.

Proceeds  from  the  sales,  calls  and  maturities  of  investments  in  debt
securities  during  1995  totaled  $78.1  million  and  resulted  in  realized
investment  gains  of approximately $.5 million and realized investment losses
of  approximately  $2.1 million.  During 1994 and 1993, proceeds totaled $86.4
million  and $136.4 million, respectively; resulting in realized capital gains
of $303,000 and $1.5 million, respectively.  Realized losses for 1994 and 1993
were  $4.5  million  and  $3.2  million,  respectively.  In addition to losses
incurred  in  connection with the sale of investments during 1993, the Company
reduced  the  carrying value of a corporate bond by $.5 million to reflect the
Company's estimate of a permanent decline in the value of this investment.  At
December 31, 1995, securities with a cost of $9.4 million were on deposit with
insurance regulatory authorities.

In  1990,  the Company securitized pools of commercial real estate loans owned
by  it  in  two  transactions  and  in  connection therewith sold pass-through
certificates("Series  90-1" and "Series 90-2") for which an election under the
real  estate  mortgage investment conduit provisions ("REMIC") of the Internal
Revenue  Code  of  1986,  as  amended  were  made.  The Company retained as an
investment  subordinated  junior  certificates  in  both  issues, as well as a
senior certificate interest in Series 90-2.

Included  in  "Held-to-maturity," fixed maturity securities are investments in
the  two REMIC's of approximately $44.2 million at December 31, 1995 and $46.2
million at December 31, 1994.

A  summary  of the Company's investment at December 31, 1995 in the REMIC's is

Payments  made  for  income  taxes, net of refunds received,  during the years
ended December 31, 1995, 1994 and 1993 were $4.6 million, $1.4 million and $.6
million, respectively.

Retained  earnings  at December 31, 1995 include approximately $5.2 million of
"Policyholders'  Surplus"  on  which  no  federal  income  tax payment will be
required  unless  it  is  distributed  as  a  dividend  or  exceeds the limits
prescribed  by  tax  laws  applicable to life insurance companies.  A deferred
income  tax  liability  has  not been recognized for this amount.  The maximum
federal  income  tax  provision possibly required based on the current federal
income tax rate would be $1.8 million.

liabilities,"  in  the  amount of $2.3 million at December 31, 1995, and  $1.7
million at December 31, 1994.

UCLC  in loan securitizations.  Also, under an agreement, UCLC is obligated to
repurchase  these home-equity loans previously sold to the Company at the time
of  foreclosure.    At  December  31,  1995,  approximately  $166.5 million of
home-equity  loans  originated  by UCLC were owned by the Company.  During the
years ended December 31, 1995, 1994 and 1993 the Company purchased home-equity
loans  of  approximately  $1,169  million,  $893  million  and $569.9 million,
respectively,  from  UCLC.    Sales  of these home-equity loans to UCLC by the
Company  were  $1,112  million  in  1995,  $932.7  million in 1994, and $457.3
million  in  1993.    No  gain  or  loss  was recorded by the Company in these

Company  having  aggregate  unpaid  principal balances of approximately $338.4
million,  $296.9  million  and $338.7 million, respectively.  The Company paid
servicing  fees  relative to these loans of approximately $.9 million in 1995,
$1.1 million in 1994 and $1.3 million in 1993.

The Company leases home office space to its Parent and other affiliates.  Rent
income attributable to these affiliates was approximately $1.0 million in each

Interest  income  received  from  UCLC  with  respect  to  those  subordinated
debentures  totaled  approximately  $668,000  in  each  of  1995  and 1994 and
$345,000 in 1993.  All principal is payable upon maturity.

The Company is a participant in UCFC's consolidated income tax agreement.  See
Note 1.9.

6.  EMPLOYEE BENEFIT PLANS

All  employees  who  meet  minimum age and service requirements participate in
UCFC's Employee Stock Ownership Plan ("ESOP").  Under the ESOP, UCFC makes tax
deductible  contributions  of  its  common  stock  (or  cash  which is used to
purchase  its  common stock or to repay debt used by the ESOP to purchase such
stock)  to  a trust for the benefit of participating employees.  Contributions
are  allocated among participants based on years of service and compensation. 
Upon  retirement,  death or disability, the employee or a beneficiary receives
the designated common stock.

Contributions  to  the  ESOP are determined on an annual basis.  The Company's
contributions  to  the  ESOP were $244,000, $189,000 and $74,000 for the years
ended December 31, 1995, 1994 and 1993, respectively.

Eligible  employees  may  elect  to participate in the UCFC Employees' Savings
Plan  and Trust which is designed to be a qualified plan under Sections 401(a)
and  401(k) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1988, as amended.  Under the plan,
employees are allowed to defer income on a pre-tax basis through contributions
to  the  plan  and  the  Company matches a portion of such contributions.  The
Company's matching contributions totaled $170,000, $138,000 and $49,000 during
1995,  1994  and  1993, respectively.  Employees have five investment options,
one of which is to invest in the Parent's common stock.

7.  REGULATORY ACCOUNTING

Accounting  records  of  the  Company  are  also maintained in accordance with
practices  prescribed  or  authorized  by  insurance  regulatory authorities. 
Prescribed  statutory  accounting principles include a variety of publications
of the National Association of Insurance Commissioners, as well as state laws,
regulations, and general administrative rules.  Permitted statutory accounting
practices encompass all accounting practices not so prescribed.  The Company's
capital and surplus pursuant to the regulatory accounting basis as of December
31,  1995  and  1994  was $99.9 million and $90.0 million, respectively.  On a
regulatory  accounting  basis,  net  gain  from operations for the years ended
December  31,  1995,  1994 and 1993 was $12.8  million, $9.7 million and $13.0
million,  respectively.    Net income (loss) on a regulatory accounting basis,
which  includes  realized  capital  gains  and losses, was $10.0 million, $5.8
million  and  $(1.7)  million  for the years ended December 31, 1995, 1994 and
1993,  respectively.   As a Louisiana domiciled insurance company, the Company
is subject to certain regulatory restrictions on the payment of dividends.  At
December  31,  1995  dividends  of  $9.2  million  may  be  paid without prior
regulatory  approval.  The Company did not pay any dividends during 1995, 1994
or 1993 in order to retain capital.

The  Company  received  written  approval  from  the  Louisiana  Department of
Insurance  to  invest  in  first lien residential mortgage loans originated by
UCLC  on  a  short-term basis without recording the assignment of the mortgage
loans  to  the  Company,  which  differs  from prescribed statutory accounting
practices.    Statutory  accounting  practices  prescribed  by  the  State  of
Louisiana  require  that  investments  in  mortgage  loans  be  secured  by
unrestricted first liens on the underlying property.  As of December 31, 1995,
statutory  surplus was increased by approximately $53.7 million as a result of
this permitted practice.

8.  DISCLOSURE ABOUT FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS

Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 107 ("SFAS 107") requires that
the  Company  disclose the estimated fair values of its financial instruments,
both  assets  and  liabilities  recognized and not recognized in its financial
statements.

SFAS  107  defines  financial  instruments  as cash and contractual rights and
obligations  that  require  settlement  in  cash  or  by exchange of financial
instruments.    Fair  value  is  defined as the amount at which the instrument
could be exchanged in a current transaction between willing parties other than
in a forced or liquidation sale.

The  carrying  value  and  fair  value  of  the Company's financial assets and
liabilities were as follows:

</TABLE>



The above values do not reflect any premium or discount from offering for sale
at  one  time  the  Company's  entire  holdings  of  a  particular  financial
instrument.    Fair value estimates are made at a specific point in time based
on  relevant  market  information, if available.  Because no market exists for
certain of the Company's financial instruments, fair value estimates for these
assets and liabilities were based on subjective estimates of market conditions
and  perceived  risks of the financial instruments.  Fair value estimates were
also  based  on  judgments regarding future loss and prepayment experience and
were influenced by the Company's historical information.

The  following methods and assumptions were used to estimate the fair value of
the Company's financial instruments.

FIXED  MATURITY  AND  EQUITY  SECURITIES.    The  estimated fair value for the
Company's  investment  portfolio  was  generally determined from quoted market
prices for publicly traded securities.  Certain of the securities owned by the
Company  may trade infrequently or not at all; therefore, fair value for these
securities was determined by management by evaluating the relationship between
quoted  market  values  and carrying value and assigning a liquidity factor to
this segment of the investment portfolio.

MORTGAGE LOANS ON REAL ESTATE.  The fair value of the Company's loan portfolio
was determined by segregating the portfolio by type of loan and further by its
performing  and  non-performing  components.    Performing  loans were further
segregated based on the due date of their payments, an analysis of credit risk
by  category was performed and a matrix of pricing by category was developed. 
Loans  which  were current were valued at remaining principal balance which is
believed  to  represent  an  estimate  of  market  discount from similar loans
identified  for  sale.    The  fair value of delinquent loans was estimated by
using the Company's historical recoverable amount on defaulted loans.

INVESTMENT  REAL  ESTATE.    The  fair  value of the Company's investment real
estate was based upon independent appraisals of the properties.

POLICY  LOANS.    Policy  loans  are generally settled at the loan amount plus
accrued  interest;  therefore,  the  carrying  value  of  these  assets  is  a
reasonable estimate of their fair values.

OTHER  INVESTMENT ASSETS.  The fair value of the Company's investment in other
invested assets approximate their carrying value.
SHORT-TERM  INVESTMENTS.    The  carrying  amount  of  short-term  investments
approximates  their  fair  values  because these assets generally mature in 90
days or less and do not present any significant credit concerns.

INVESTMENT  IN  LIMITED  PARTNERSHIPS.    The  fair  value  of  the  Company's
investment in limited partnerships approximated their carrying value.

ANNUITY  RESERVES.    The  Company's annuity contracts generally do not have a
defined  maturity  and  are  considered  as  deposits under SFAS 97.  SFAS 107
states  that  the  fair  value to be disclosed for deposit liabilities with no
defined  maturities  is  the  amount payable on demand at the reporting date. 
Accordingly,  the Company has estimated the fair value of its annuity reserves
as the cash surrender value of these contracts.

REPURCHASE AGREEMENTS.  The repurchase agreements mature in less than 60 days;
therefore, the carrying value of the repurchase agreements is considered to be
a reasonable estimate of fair value.

9.  SUBSEQUENT EVENT

On  February  2,  1996,  UCFC  signed  a  stock purchase agreement dated as of
January  30, 1996, for the sale of all of the outstanding capital stock of the
Company    to  UC  Life  Holding  Corp., a new Delaware corporation, formed by
Knightsbridge  Capital  Fund  I,  L.P. for an aggregate amount of $164 million
plus  earnings  of  the  Company  from  January  1,  1996,  to  closing of the
transaction.    Knightsbridge,  which is a private investment partnership with
institutional  partners,  was  formed  in  1995  to make equity investments in
companies engaged primarily in the life insurance industry.

Under  the  terms  of  the  agreement,  the  sales price is comprised of cash,
currently estimated to be $109 million, and real estate and other assets owned
by  the  Company  to  be  distributed  to UCFC prior to the closing.  The real
estate  to  be  distributed includes portions of the United Plaza office park,
including  the  home  office.    In addition, UCFC will purchase a convertible
promissory  note  from an affiliate of the purchaser for $15 million in cash. 
The  note  matures  in  11 years and bears interest at 8% per annum payable at
maturity.

The purchaser also agreed that the Company would continue to be an investor in
first  lien  home equity loans originated by UCFCs lending operations and that
the  Companys  home  office  operations  would  be  maintained  in its present
location  in  Baton  Rouge,  Louisiana  following the closing for at least two
years.    The  agreement  is  subject  to  approval  by UCFCs shareholders and
regulatory  authorities and the satisfaction of other conditions, and provides
that the closing will occur on or before July 31, 1996.

10.  CONTINGENCIES

The  Company  is  subject  to  various  litigation arising during the ordinary
course  of business.  While the outcome of such litigation cannot be predicted
with  certainty, management does not expect the resolution of these matters to
have  a  material  adverse  effect  on  the  financial condition or results of
operations of the Company.
