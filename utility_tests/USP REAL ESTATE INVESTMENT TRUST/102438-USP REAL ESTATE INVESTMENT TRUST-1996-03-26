Item I.  Business

The Trust

USP Real Estate Investment Trust is an equity-oriented real
estate investment trust organized under the laws of the State of
Iowa pursuant to a Declaration of Trust as amended and restated
through April 23, 1984.  The Trust was formed on March 10, 1970
to provide its shareholders with an opportunity to participate in
the benefits of real estate investment and at the same time enjoy
the liquidity and marketability resulting from the ownership of
securities which are publicly-traded.

USP has elected to qualify as a real estate investment trust
("REIT") under the Internal Revenue Code.  As a result of this
election, the Trust is not taxed on the portion of its income
which is distributed to shareholders, provided it distributes at
least 95% of its taxable income, has at least 75% of its assets
in real estate investments and meets certain other requirements
for qualification as a real estate investment trust.

The Trust has no employees as all services necessary to conduct
the day-to-day operations are performed by AEGON USA Realty
Advisors, Inc. ("AEGON Realty Advisors") and its affiliates.
(See Note 5 to the Financial Statements.)


Investment Policy

The Trust's primary investment objective is to invest in real
estate which will provide the best available cash flow and offer
prospects for long-term appreciation in value.  The Trust
selectively sells property when it is determined that a sales
transaction will economically benefit the Trust through the
realization of capital gains.  The Trust does not acquire
property with a view to realizing appreciation from short-term
sales.

The Trust has sought to achieve its investment objectives by
investing principally in the direct ownership of real estate.
Short-term cash investments are made in high-quality commercial
paper, money market funds and certificates of deposit.

Source of Funds and Financing

The principal source of funds for investment by USP was $25
million in proceeds from its initial public offering of shares.
The Trust ceased the issuance of shares from this offering in
1978.  The Trust completed a secondary offering of its shares in
1988, raising nearly $10 million.  Since substantially all of the
Trust's net income must be distributed to shareholders in order
to qualify as a real estate investment trust, USP has relied
primarily on cash generated from operations and property sales in
excess of shareholder distributions, along with long-term
borrowings secured by mortgages on specific properties, to
finance real estate investments.  Outstanding indebtedness of USP
may not, according to the Declaration of Trust, exceed four
hundred percent of the Trust's net assets (shareholders' equity
plus accumulated depreciation).  The aggregate principal amount
of long-term mortgage indebtedness and net assets of the Trust as
of December 31, 1995 were $15,271,385 and $27,016,153,
respectively.

The Trust may finance future real estate investments through
additional borrowings secured by mortgages on the Trust's real
estate properties.  USP currently has no commitments or
arrangements for any such financing and there can be no assurance
that suitable financing will be available on terms satisfactory
to the Trust in the future.  A $500,000 bank line of credit is
available to the Trust on an uncommitted basis, draws against
which must be collateralized by securities or other assets.

Mortgage Loans Receivable

In December 1990, the Trust sold Hickory Hills Shopping Center in
Hillsville, Virginia and College Square Shopping Center in
Jefferson City, Tennessee.  The Trust provided mortgage loan
financing for these sales in the amount of $525,000 for Hickory
Hills and $1,125,000 for College Square.  The loans mature on
December 20, 1997 and yield 9.5% to the Trust.

Competition

USP's portfolio competes with other similar properties in its
respective markets, some of which are newer than the USP
properties.  A strengthening U.S. economy, a low level of
commercial real estate construction, and strong leasing efforts
were factors resulting in improvement in the occupancy of Trust
properties during the past three years.  Overall occupancy for
the entire portfolio was 96% at December 31, 1995, 96% at
December 31, 1994, and 95% at December 31, 1993.

Item 2.  Properties

Real Estate Investments

The Trust has direct ownership of seven commercial real estate
properties.  These real estate investments are diversified
geographically with 57% of the portfolio located in the
Southeast, 22% in the Southwest and 21% in the Great Lakes Region
based on the cost of the properties.

Properties owned by the Trust are leased to tenants either on a
managed basis or under net lease arrangements.  As the owner of
managed property the Trust receives gross rentals and incurs
operating expenses, such as property taxes, insurance, repairs,
maintenance and common area utilities.  Under net lease
arrangements, the tenant, rather than the Trust, pays all
operating expenses related to the leased premises.  At December
31, 1995, six commercial properties were being leased on a
managed basis and one property was leased on a net lease basis.

The six managed commercial properties consisted of five shopping
centers and one business park.  Managed commercial properties
comprised 95% of the Trust's investment portfolio in 1995, 1994,
and in 1993.  Managed commercial properties provided 89% of USP's
annual revenue in 1995, compared to 91% in 1994 and 92% in 1993.
All managed properties have at least one tenant representing more
than 20% of the revenue from that property, and the Kroger
Company represents more than 11% of the total revenue of the
Trust under a lease expiring in April 2012.

The net leased property is an office/warehouse which represented
approximately 5% of the Trust's investment portfolio in 1995,
1994, and in 1993, and generated 6% of the Trust's annual revenue
in 1995, 1994, and 1993.  Trust properties and operations are
summarized in the table on the next page.

The Trust's real estate investments are not expected to be
substantially affected by current federal, state or local laws
and regulations establishing ecological or environmental
restrictions on the development and operations of such property.
However, the enactment of new provisions or laws may reduce the
Trust's ability to fulfill its investment objectives.

Geneva, Wisconsin in January 1996.  The Trust has filed a claim
as an unsecured creditor due to the tenant's rejection of its
lease through the bankruptcy proceedings.  The amount of that
claim, limited to 15% of the amounts owed for the unexpired
balance of the lease term, was $514,000.  The Trust subsequently
elected to accept 70% of that amount through a proposed
bankruptcy payout plan.  Accordingly, a settlement distribution
of approximately $360,000 is expected from the bankruptcy
trustee.  At this time it is still uncertain what amounts will
actually be received by the Trust through the bankruptcy
proceedings, and when those payments, if any, will be made.

Staples, Inc. at North Park Plaza in Phoenix, Arizona closed its
18,000 square foot store in February 1996 and moved to a new
center in the metro area.  Staples has assigned their lease which
runs through July 2003, to the developer of the new center.  The
Trust is cooperating with the developer in securing a new tenant
for the space.

The portfolio operating results in the forthcoming year will
greatly depend upon all tenants continuing to pay their rent and
the Trust's ability to renew expiring tenant leases and obtain
new leases at competitive rental rates.

On February 1, 1995, the Trust announced that it had begun
exploring strategic alternatives to maximize shareholder value.
The decision reflects the opinion of the Trust's board of
trustees that recent market prices for the Trust's shares have
not adequately reflected the value of the Trust.  During 1995,
the Trust explored various alternatives and conducted discussions
with a number of prospective buyers but were unable to reach an
agreement on the terms and conditions of a specific transaction.
While the Trust will continue to consider other potential
transactions which will serve to maximize shareholder value,
there is no assurance any transaction will be consummated.

Distribution Information

The Trust is required to distribute at least 95% of its taxable
income to continue its qualification as a real estate investment
trust.  Although the Trust expects to continue making
distributions to shareholders, there is no assurance of future
distributions, since they are dependent upon earnings, cash flow,
the financial condition of the Trust and other factors.

Item 7.  Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial
Condition and Results of Operations

The discussion that follows should be read in the general context
of the discussion in "Item 1 Business" and "Item 2 Properties."

Results of Operations

Growth in the U.S. economy continued in 1995, with the Gross
Domestic Product gaining 4.2%.  Job growth in the U.S. non-
agricultural employment increased by 1.7 million as of last
August compared to one year earlier.  Retail sales in 1995 posted
a 5% increase over 1994.  The Trust benefited from these positive
economic factors and experienced an improvement in the portfolio
operating results in 1995.  In the foreseeable future, "outlet
megamalls" (giant retail facilities ranging from one to two
million square feet) have the potential of becoming more common
and thus compete with traditional centers for consumer
consumption.

A number of specific tenant situations may have an impact on the
Trust's operating results in 1996.  Luria's, a 23,587 square foot
tenant at Kingsley Square in Orange Park, Florida, discontinued
operations there in March 1995.  Luria's has continued to pay
rent and has notified the Trust that it intends to honor its
lease obligations, which run through March 2010.  The Trust is
cooperating with Luria's in securing a new tenant to sublease
this space.  P.W. Enterprises has filed a Chapter 11
reorganization plan and closed its 63,146 square foot store at
Geneva Square in Lake Geneva, Wisconsin in January 1996.  The
Trust has filed a claim as an unsecured creditor due to the
tenant's rejection of its lease through the bankruptcy
proceedings.  The amount of that claim, limited to 15% of the
amounts owed for the unexpired balance of the lease term, was
$514,000.  The Trust subsequently elected to accept 70% of that
amount through a proposed bankruptcy payout plan.  Accordingly, a
settlement distribution of approximately $360,000 is expected
from the bankruptcy trustee.  At this time it is still uncertain
what amounts will actually be received by the Trust through the
bankruptcy proceedings, and when those payments, if any, will be
made.  Staples, Inc. at North Park Plaza in Phoenix, Arizona
closed its 18,000 square foot store in February 1996 and moved to
a new center in the metro area.  Staples has assigned their lease
which runs through July 2003, to the developer of the new center.
The Trust is cooperating with the developer in securing a new
tenant for the space.  The portfolio operating results in the
forthcoming year will greatly depend upon these (and all other)
tenants to continue paying their rent and the Trust's ability to
renew expiring tenant leases and obtain new leases at competitive
rental rates.

It is the opinion of the Trust's board of trustees that the
recent market prices for the Trust's shares do not adequately
reflect the value of the Trust.  During 1995, the Trust explored
various strategic alternatives, including a possible sale of the
Trust's assets, with the intent to maximize shareholder value.
There were discussions with a number of prospective buyers, but
the Trust was unable to reach an agreement on the terms and
conditions of a specific transaction.  While the Trust will
continue to consider other potential transactions which will
serve to maximize shareholder value, there is no assurance that
any transaction will be consummated.

1995 compared to 1994

Rents and property expenses declined from 1994 to 1995 due to the
September 1994 sale of Midway Business Park, in Tucson, Arizona.
Rental income was $5,366,255 in 1995 compared to $5,960,114 in
1994 which represents a decrease of 10%.  However, rental income
from properties owned throughout both years increased 3% from
$5,222,406 in 1994 to $5,366,255 in 1995 primarily due to an
increase of $125,000 in expense recoveries from tenants and
higher overage rents. Interest income was $251,759 in 1995
compared to $219,381 in 1994, an increase of 15%, due to higher
interest rates on the investable cash balances and the receipt of
$13,000 in interest on property tax refunds.

First Tuesday Mall in Carrollton, Georgia recorded higher rents
primarily due to the lease of a furniture store in mid-1994 which
occupies 23,040 square feet.  North Park and Presidential Drive
Business Park in Atlanta, Georgia experienced a reduction in base
rents from 1994 as North Park set up a rent reserve for some
delinquent rents in 1995 and Presidential recovered delinquent
rents in 1994 which had been considered uncollectible.  As stated
above, the largest increase in rents occurred due to an increase
of $125,000 in expense recoveries primarily from Kingsley Square,
First Tuesday and North Park.  These three properties experienced
higher real estate taxes which, pursuant to the terms of tenant
leases, resulted in the Trust being able to collect this increase
in taxes from the tenants.

Property expenses before depreciation were $1,755,295 in 1995
compared to $1,928,502 in 1994 which represents 33% of rental
income for 1995 and 32% of rental income for 1994.  The primary
reason for the decrease was the sale of Midway.  On a same
property basis, property expenses increased to $1,755,295 in 1995
from $1,594,949 in 1994.  Accounting for this change was the
increase in real estate taxes from Kingsley Square, North Park
and First Tuesday as First Tuesday received tax refunds in 1994.
All wages and salaries in 1994 were incurred in connection with
the operation of Midway, the sale of which resulted in a decrease
of $19,000 in this expense.  Repairs and maintenance decreased
$19,000 due to the sale of Midway which incurred $78,000 in
repair and maintenance items in 1994.  On a same property basis,
repairs and maintenance in 1995 increased $59,000 from 1994
primarily due to remodeling expenditures for an existing tenant
at Presidential Drive and improvements made to the exterior of
the building.  Utilities decreased $35,000 from 1994 to 1995 due
to the sale of Midway.  Insurance expense declined due to the
sale of Midway and lower insurance premiums.  Other property
expenses were $13,000 lower primarily due to the sale of Midway,
which incurred $27,000 in 1994, offset by $15,000 in
environmental consulting on all of the properties in 1995.

Depreciation expense declined $139,000 in 1995 due primarily to
the sale of Midway.  Interest expense decreased $390,000 due to
the prepayment of the loan on Midway upon sale, and the
prepayment of one of the mortgage loans on First Tuesday.  The
prepayment on First Tuesday, including a 1% fee to the lender,
was $1,147,526 which was paid on January 31, 1995.  The annual
debt service on this mortgage was $229,068, including interest at
10%.  Administrative expense decreased $24,000 primarily due to
the sale of Midway, which resulted in lower administrative fees
of $17,000, and a $7,000 reduction in premium on directors and
officers insurance.

Earnings from operations were $1,100,149 in 1995 compared to
$934,605 in 1994, which represents an increase of 18% primarily
due to the significant decrease in interest expense as more fully
described above.  Net earnings were $1,100,149 in 1995 compared
to $1,723,193 in 1994, the decrease primarily attributed to the
$788,588 gain on sale of Midway in 1994.

1994 compared to 1993

Rental income was $5,960,114 in 1994 compared to $6,077,305 in
1993 which represented a decrease of 2%.  However, rental income
from properties owned throughout both years increased 3% from
$5,082,726 in 1993 to $5,222,406 in 1994 primarily due to higher
occupancy rates.  Interest income was $219,381 in 1994 compared
to $195,158 in 1993, an increase of 12%, due to higher investable
cash balances and higher interest rates received on these
balances in 1994.

Kingsley Square in Orange Park, Florida recorded higher rents of
$50,000 (7% over 1993) as a result of increases in average
occupancy and rental rates.  The Trust entered into a new lease
in 1994 with a furniture store for 23,040 square feet at First
Tuesday Mall in Carrollton, Georgia which was the primary reason
for a $42,000 or 5% increase in rents at this property.  Rental
income at Mendenhall Commons in Memphis, Tennessee increased
$52,000 or 6% due primarily to increased tenant expense
recoveries.  Presidential Drive in Atlanta, Georgia recorded a
revenue increase of $62,000 or 25% in 1994 due to increased
rental rates and recovery of delinquent rents which had been
considered uncollectible.  Insurance proceeds covered the loss of
rents from several tenants which were displaced at this property
during a portion of 1994.  North Park Plaza in Phoenix, Arizona
and Yamaha Warehouse in Cudahy, Wisconsin recorded moderate
revenue increases in 1994.  Geneva Square in Lake Geneva,
Wisconsin was the only property showing a decline in revenues, as
rental income fell $91,000 or 8% due to a decrease in occupancy
from 1993, a year in which the property operated at 100%
occupancy for most of the year.

Property expenses before depreciation were $1,928,502 in 1994
compared to $1,957,429 in 1993 which represents 32% of rental
income for both years.  The primary reason for the decrease was
the sale of Midway in September 1994.  Midway's property expenses
before depreciation declined $106,000 in 1994 due to the partial
year of operation by the Trust.  On a same property basis,
property expenses before depreciation increased to $1,594,949 in
1994 from $1,517,985 in 1993.  Real estate taxes increased
$12,000 in 1994 as a result of an $82,000 increase at Mendenhall
Commons due to a tax refund received in 1993, which was partially
offset by tax decreases at First Tuesday, North Park, and Midway
(due to the partial year of operation).  All wages and salaries
were incurred in connection with the operation of Midway, the
sale of which resulted in a $12,000 decrease in this expense.
Repairs and maintenance expense increased $28,000 as a result of
a $68,000 increase at First Tuesday due to higher remodeling
expenditures for new and existing tenants, which was partially
offset by a $42,000 decline at Midway due to the partial year of
operations.  Other property expenses were $33,000 lower in 1994
because of a consulting fee paid in 1993 to obtain the tax refund
at Mendenhall and a reduction in advertising expense in 1994.
Depreciation expense declined $68,000 in 1994 due primarily to
the Midway sale.  Interest expense decreased $244,000 as a result
of lower interest rates negotiated in connection with refinancing
the mortgage loans on Geneva Square and Midway in the first
quarter of 1994 and the payoff of the mortgage on Midway upon
sale of the property.  Administrative expense increased $28,000
in 1994 as a result of increases in legal, mailing, and printing
costs.

Earnings from operation were $934,605 in 1994 compared to
$715,746 in 1993 which represents an increase of 31% primarily
due to the significant decline in total expenses, as more fully
described above.  With the $788,588 gain recognized on the sale
of Midway, 1994 net earnings were $1,723,193 compared to 1993 net
earnings of $715,746.

Cash Flow and Funds from Operations

The Trust has for several years used "funds from operations" as a
measurement of operating performance.  Funds from operations, as
used in this report, is defined as:  net income (computed in
accordance with generally accepted accounting principles),
excluding gains (or losses) from debt restructuring and sales of
property, plus depreciation.  The Trust has adopted this
definition of "funds from operations" as a more meaningful
measurement of the ongoing performance of a real estate entity
than either "net cash provided by operating activities,"
identified in the Statements of Cash Flows, or "earnings from
operations," identified in the Statements of Earnings.

Funds from operations takes into consideration the accrual of
revenue and expenses, which more appropriately reflects operating
performance.  Net cash provided by operating activities
represents cash receipts and disbursements without regard to when
income was earned or expense incurred.  Earnings from operations
considers the accrual of revenue and expenses, but is limited as
a measurement of the ongoing performance of a real estate entity
because it includes depreciation, a non-cash expense.  The Trust
intends to continue using funds from operations as a measure of
operating performance.

Liquidity and Capital Resources

The Trust's capital resources consist of its current equity in
real estate investments and mortgage loans receivable.  The Trust
maintains its properties in good condition and provides adequate
insurance coverage.  Liquidity is represented by cash and cash
equivalents ($1,370,623 at December 31, 1995), a $500,000 line of
credit (see discussion under "Item 1 Business - Source of Funds
and Financing") and the continued operation of the Trust's real
estate portfolio.  This liquidity is considered sufficient to
meet current obligations.

Net cash provided by operating activities, as shown in the
Statements of Cash Flows, was $2,000,023 for the year ended
December 31, 1995.  Major applications of cash in 1995 included
$1,136,164 for prepayment of one of the mortgage loans on First
Tuesday Mall,  $1,164,000 for distributions to shareholders, and
$452,695 in principal payments on mortgage loans payable.  The
Trust's debt service commitments for mortgage loans payable are
described in Note 6 to the Financial Statements.

The Publix Supermarkets lease at Kingsley Square was extended
effective February 11, 1995 for a five-year term.  The lease
extension requires the Trust to contribute up to $250,000 toward
remodeling costs at the Publix store.  This amount is expected to
be paid in 1996.  Capital expenditures at other properties of
approximately $240,000 are anticipated for 1996.  As of December
31, 1995, there were no other material commitments.

The Board of Trustees continues to monitor occupancies, leasing
activity, overall Trust operations, liquidity, and financial
condition in determining quarterly distributions to shareholders.

Inflation

Low to moderate levels of inflation during the past few years
have favorably impacted the Company's operation by stabilizing
operating expenses.  At the same time, low inflation has the
indirect effect of reducing the Company's ability to increase
tenant rents.  The Trust's properties have tenants whose leases
include expense reimbursements and other provisions to minimize
the effect of inflation.  These factors, in the long run, are
expected to result in more attractive returns from the Trust's
real estate portfolio as compared to short-term investment
vehicles.

Notes to Financial Statements

1.  Accounting Policies

The Trust is predominantly in the business of investing in real
estate.  Investments in real estate are stated at cost.  The
Trust provides an allowance for valuation of real estate when it
is determined that the values have permanently declined below
recorded book value.

In March 1995, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued
Statement No. 121, Accounting for the Impairment of Long-Lived
Assets and for Long-Lived Assets to Be Disposed Of, which
requires impairment losses to be recorded on long-lived assets
used in operations when indicators of impairment are present and
the undiscounted cash flows estimated to be generated by those
assets are less than the assets' carrying amount. Statement No.
121 also addresses the accounting for long-lived assets that are
expected to be disposed of.  The Trust's adoption of Statement
No. 121 in 1995 had no impact on the Trust's operations.

Expenditures for repairs and maintenance which do not add to the
value or extend the useful life of property are expensed when
incurred.  Additions to existing properties, including
replacements, improvements and expenditures which do add to the
value or extend the useful life of property, are capitalized.
Depreciation is calculated using the straight-line method over
the estimated useful lives of the respective assets.

The Trust follows the operating method of accounting for leases,
whereby scheduled rental income is recognized on a straight-line
basis over the lease term. Contingent rental income is recognized
in the period in which it arises.  Interest on mortgage loans
receivable and amortization of discounts are recognized as income
over the period the respective loans are outstanding.  The Trust
provides for possible losses on mortgage loans, rents and other
receivables when it is determined that collection of such
receivables is doubtful.  Rents and other receivables are stated
net of an allowance for uncollectible accounts of $143,991 in
1995 and $100,744 in 1994. Cash equivalents include investments
with original maturities of three months or less.

Gains on real estate sales are recognized for financial
accounting purposes in accordance with Financial Accounting
Standard No. 66, Accounting for Sales of Real Estate.  Deferred
gains are recognized as income using the installment method.  Net
earnings per share are computed using the weighted average number
of shares outstanding during the year.

The preparation of financial statements in conformity with
generally accepted accounting principles requires management to
make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported
in the financial statements and accompanying notes. The actual
results of the Trust could differ as a result of those estimates.
2.  Real Estate

Investments in real estate consist entirely of managed and net
leased commercial property.  Information regarding the Trust's
investment in each property is presented in the Schedule of Real
Estate and Accumulated Depreciation below:

 The estimated fair value of mortgage notes receivable at
December 31, 1995 was $1,616,938 compared to the carrying value
of $1,547,249. The estimated fair value is greater than the
carrying value as a result of the current interest rate applied
to discount the cash flows being lower than the stated rate of
the notes. The activity in mortgage loans receivable for the
three years ended December 31, 1995 is summarized in the table

5. Transactions With Affiliates

The Trust has contracted with AEGON USA Realty Advisors, Inc.
("AEGON Realty Advisors") to provide administrative services for
a base fee of 5/8% of the average gross real estate investment
plus 1/4% of the monthly balance of mortgage loans receivable and
an incentive fee of 20% of annual adjusted cash flow from
operations in excess of $.72 per share.  If the annual adjusted
cash flow from operations is less than $.72 per share, then the
payment of so much of the base fee is to be deferred so that
revised cash flow from operations will be equal to $.72 per
share; provided, however, in no event shall the amount deferred
exceed 20% of the previously determined base fee.  Any deferred
fees may be paid in subsequent years (subject to certain limits).
Annual adjusted cash flow from operations, as defined for
purposes of the incentive fee, includes the net realized gain (or
loss) from the disposition of property, adjusted to exclude
accumulated depreciation (otherwise stated as gain in excess of
cost without reduction for allowable depreciation).  The
administrative fee is limited to 1 1/2% of average quarterly net
invested assets.  The administrative agreement is for a one-year
term, automatically renewed annually and cancellable by either
party upon 90 days written notice.  Amounts paid to AEGON Realty
Advisors for administrative services were:  $202,410 for 1995,
$219,982 for 1994, and $227,352 for 1993.  No incentive fees were
paid in 1995, 1994 or 1993.  Administrative fees of $50,603 in
1995, $54,995 in 1994, and $56,838 in 1993 were deferred, but may
become payable in subsequent years.  Cumulative deferred
administrative fees were $458,509 as of December 31, 1995.

AEGON Realty Advisors also provides real estate acquisition and
disposition services for the Trust.  A negotiated fee of 2% to 4%
of the cost is charged for properties acquired.  No separate fee
is charged for property dispositions.  There were no acquisition
fees paid in 1995, 1994 or 1993.

The estimated fair value of mortgage notes payable at December
31, 1995 was $16,519,743 compared to the carrying value of
$15,271,385. The estimated fair value exceeds the carrying value
as a result of the current interest rate applied to discount the
cash flows being lower than the stated rate of the mortgage
notes.

Scheduled monthly payments will substantially amortize the
principal balances of the mortgage loans over their respective
terms with the exception of balloon payments at maturity.
Amortized payments on the outstanding balances due in the next
five years, including balloon repayments at maturity, are
summarized as follows:

7.  Leased Assets

The Trust is lessor of various properties as described in Note 2.
Certain properties are leased to tenants under long-term, non-
cancellable operating lease agreements.  Future minimum lease
rentals to be received under the terms of these lease agreements
are as follows:

  Year        Amount
                     
  1996       3,975,810
  1997       3,308,391
  1998       2,614,548
  1999       2,236,808
  2000       1,946,963
2001-2012   11,424,535
                  

Contingent rentals included in income received in connection with
operating leases were $106,458, $82,754, and $98,228 for the
years ended December 31, 1995, 1994 and 1993, respectively.  Such
rentals are based principally on tenant sales in excess of
stipulated minimums.  In 1995 and in 1994, the Trust derived 10%
or more of its revenue from the Kroger Company at Mendenhall
Commons.  The revenue from this tenant was $636,898 in 1995 and
$647,180 in 1994.  The Trust did not receive 10% or more of its
revenue from any one tenant in 1993.

In August 1994, Publix Supermarkets exercised an option to extend
their lease for 34,400 square feet in Kingsley Square. The lease
extension, effective February 11, 1995, has a term of five years
and requires the Trust to contribute up to $250,000 toward
remodeling costs at the Publix store. The Trust expects to incur
this cost in 1996.

8.  Federal Income Taxes

The Trust conducts its operations so as to qualify as a real
estate investment trust under the Internal Revenue Code which
requires, among other things, that at least 95% of the Trust's
taxable income be distributed to shareholders.  The Trust has
historically distributed all of its taxable income. Distributions
made in 1995 plus a portion of the Trust's first distribution in
1996 were used to meet the Internal Revenue Code distribution
requirements for 1995. Accordingly, no provision has been made
for federal income taxes since the Trust did not have taxable
income after the deductions allowed for distributions to
shareholders.

Certain property acquisitions have resulted in the basis of those
properties being determined differently for financial accounting
purposes than for income tax purposes.  The differing methods of
determination of basis in these transactions has resulted in the
tax basis of certain properties being higher or lower than the
financial basis.  At December 31, 1995 the tax basis of real
estate was $133,710 in excess of the financial basis.

9.  Legal Proceedings

The Trust is not a party to any pending legal proceedings which,
in the opinion of management, are material to the Trust's
financial position.

10.  Subsequent Events

P.W. Enterprises has filed a Chapter 11 reorganization plan and
closed its 63,146 square foot store at Geneva Square in Lake
Geneva, Wisconsin in January 1996.  The Trust has filed a claim
as an unsecured creditor due to the tenant's rejection of its
lease through the bankruptcy proceedings.  The amount of that
claim, limited to 15% of the amounts owed for the unexpired
balance of the lease term, was $514,000.  The Trust subsequently
elected to accept 70% of that amount through a proposed
bankruptcy payout plan.  Accordingly, a settlement distribution
of approximately $360,000 is expected from the bankruptcy
trustee.  At this time it is still uncertain what amounts will
actually be received by the Trust through the bankruptcy
proceedings, and when those payments, if any, will be made.

Staples, Inc. at North Park Plaza in Phoenix, Arizona closed its
18,000 square foot store in February 1996 and moved to a new
center in the metro area.  Staples has assigned their lease which
runs through July 2003, to the developer of the new center.  The
Trust is cooperating with the developer in securing a new tenant
for the space.

Report of Independent Auditors

The Board of Trustees and Shareholders
USP Real Estate Investment Trust

We have audited the accompanying balance sheets of USP Real
Estate Investment Trust as of December 31, 1995 and 1994, and the
related statements of earnings, shareholders' equity, and cash
flows for each of the three years in the period ended December
31, 1995.  These financial statements are the responsibility of
the Trust's management.  Our responsibility is to express an
opinion on these financial statements based on our audits.

We conducted our audits in accordance with generally accepted
auditing standards.  Those standards require that we plan and
perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether
the financial statements are free of material misstatement.  An
audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting
the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements.  An
audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and
significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating
the overall financial statement presentation.  We believe that
our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.

In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above
present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position
of USP Real Estate Investment Trust at December 31, 1995 and
1994, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for
each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 1995, in
conformity with generally accepted accounting principles.

Item 13.  Certain Relationships and Related Transactions.

The Trust has no employees and has contracted with various
subsidiaries of AEGON USA, Inc. to provide administrative,
advisory, acquisition, divestiture, property management and
shareholder services to the Trust.  A description of the
relationships between AEGON USA, Inc. and its various
subsidiaries and of such subsidiaries' agreements with the Trust
follows.  The description of the agreements which follows is
qualified in its entirety by reference to the terms and
provisions of such agreements.  (See "Item 12 Security Ownership
of Certain Beneficial Owners and Management" for a description of
the relationship between AEGON USA, Inc. and AEGON N.V.)

Administrative, Advisory and Acquisition Services

AEGON USA Realty Advisors, Inc. ("AEGON Advisors"), is a wholly-
owned subsidiary of AEGON USA, Inc.  AEGON Advisors provides
administrative, advisory, acquisition and divestiture services to
the Trust pursuant to an Administrative Agreement.  The term of
the Administrative Agreement is for one (1) year and is
automatically renewable each year for an additional year subject
to the right of either party to cancel the Agreement upon 90 days
written notice.  The performance of AEGON Advisors' duties and
obligations under the Administrative Agreement has been
guaranteed by AEGON USA, Inc.

Under the Administrative Agreement, AEGON Advisors (a) provides
clerical, administrative and data processing services, office
space, equipment and other general office services necessary for
the Trust's day-to-day operations, (b) provides legal, tax and
accounting services to maintain all necessary books and records
of the Trust and to ensure Trust compliance with all applicable
federal, state and local laws, regulatory reporting requirements
and tax codes, (c) arranges financing for the Trust, including
but not limited to mortgage financing for property acquisition,
(d) obtains property management services for the Trust's
properties and supervises the activities of persons performing
such services, (e) provides monthly reports summarizing the
results of operations and financial conditions of the Trust, (f)
prepares and files all reports to shareholders and regulatory
authorities on behalf of the Trust, (h) prepares and files all
tax returns of the Trust and (i) provides the Trust with property
acquisition and divestiture services.

AEGON Advisors receives fees for its administrative and advisory
services as follows: (a) a base fee, payable monthly, equal to
5/8% per annum of the average monthly gross real estate
investments of the Trust plus 1/4% per annum of the monthly
outstanding principal balance of mortgage loans receivable; and
(b) an incentive fee, payable annually, equal to 20% of the
annual adjusted cash flow from operations in excess of $.72 per
share.  If the annual adjusted cash flow from operations is less
than $.72 per share, then the payment of so much of the base fee
is to be deferred so that revised cash flow from operations will
be equal to $.72 per share; provided, however, in no event shall
the amount deferred exceed 20% of the previously determined base
fee.  Any deferred fees may be paid in a subsequent year, up to a
maximum of 30% of that year's revised cash flow from operations
in excess of $.72 per share.  Annual adjusted cash flow from
operations, as defined for purposes of the incentive fee,
includes the net realized gain (or loss) from the disposition of
property, adjusted to exclude accumulated depreciation (otherwise
stated as gain in excess of cost without reduction for allowable
depreciation).  Notwithstanding the foregoing, the combined base
and incentive fees cannot exceed the amount permitted by the
limitation on operating expenses as provided in the Trust's
Declaration of Trust, which limitation is essentially 1 1/2% of
the Trust's average quarterly invested assets, net of
depreciation.  In addition, AEGON Advisors is to be paid a
separately negotiated fee of not less than 2% nor more than 4% of
the cost of each property acquired by the Trust as compensation
for acquisition services furnished by it to the Trust.
Administrative fees paid to AEGON Advisors for 1995 were
$202,410.  No acquisition fees were paid in 1995.

Management Services

AEGON USA Realty Management, Inc. ("AEGON Management"), is a
wholly-owned subsidiary of AEGON Advisors.  AEGON Management
provides management services to the Trust pursuant to a Property
Management Agreement.  The term of the Agreement is for one (1)
year and is automatically renewable each year for an additional
year subject to the right of either party to cancel the Agreement
upon 30 days written notice.  Under the Management Agreement,
AEGON Management is obligated to (a) procure tenants and execute
leases with respect to Trust properties which are not leased
under net lease arrangements (the "Managed Properties"), (b)
maintain and repair (at the Trust's expense) the Managed
Properties, (c) maintain complete and accurate books and records
of the operations of the Managed Properties, (d) maintain the
Managed Properties in accordance with applicable government rules
and regulations, licensing requirements and building codes, (e)
collect all rents and (f) carry (at the Trust's expense) general
liability, accident, fire and other property damage insurance.
For these services, AEGON Management receives 5% of the gross
income derived from the operation of the Managed Properties.
Management fees paid to AEGON Management for 1995 were $250,601.

Shareholder Services

AEGON Advisors provides shareholder services to the Trust
pursuant to a Shareholder Services Agreement (the "Agreement").
Under the Agreement, AEGON Advisors is obligated to provide
dividend disbursement, stock certificate preparation,
recordkeeping and other shareholder services for which AEGON
Advisors receives the following fees:  a quarterly fee of $1.25
per shareholder account based on the number of shareholder
accounts (minimum $1,000 per quarter), a fee of $.75 per
shareholder account for each dividend processed, a fee of $.50
per shareholder account for proxy tabulation, and such other
compensation as from time to time agreed upon by the Trust and
AEGON Advisors.  Shareholder service fees paid to AEGON Advisors
for 1995 were $22,112.  AEGON Advisors has subcontracted for
stock transfer and dividend disbursement services with Boston
EquiServe, L.P., a subsidiary of State Street Bank and Trust
Company.

Other

On December 31, 1993, the mortgage loan on the Trust's
Presidential Drive property was acquired from the lender by AUSA
Life Insurance Company, Inc., a wholly-owned subsidiary of AEGON
USA, Inc., as part of a large transaction involving the transfer
of loans and securities.  The terms of the mortgage loan remained
the same.  In February 1994, the Trust refinanced the existing
mortgage loan on its Geneva Square property with a new mortgage
loan from PFL Life Insurance Company ("PFL"), a wholly-owned
subsidiary of AEGON USA, Inc.  This $3,000,000 loan was obtained
by the Trust on commercially competitive terms at a fixed
interest rate of 8% and a 1% origination fee ($30,000) was paid
to PFL in connection with the loan. The loan matured on March 1,
1996, and the Trust exercised an option to extend the loan for
eight years at 8.30% based on commercially competitive terms
offered for comparable loans by PFL.   The loan may be prepaid
without penalty any time during the first two (2) years of the
extended term.

The aggregate principal amount of the two mortgage loans
described above as of December 31, 1995 was $3,678,901.  The
maximum principal amount of such mortgage indebtedness
outstanding during 1995 was $3,770,996.  The Trust paid $92,094
in principal and $316,638 in interest on such mortgage
indebtedness for 1995.
