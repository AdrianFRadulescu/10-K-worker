ITEM 1. BUSINESS
 
 The Company operates two warehouse merchandising businesses: BJ's Wholesale
Club ("BJ's") and HomeBase. BJ's introduced the warehouse club concept to New
England in 1984 and is the third largest membership warehouse chain nationwide.
BJ's sells a narrow assortment of brand-name food and general merchandise
within a wide range of product categories. HomeBase is the second largest
operator of home improvement warehouse stores in the western United States and
one of the nation's four largest home improvement merchandisers using a
warehouse format. HomeBase offers a very broad assortment of home improvement
and building supply products. As of January 29, 1994, the Company operated 52
BJ's warehouse clubs and 82 HomeBase warehouse stores.
 
 Both BJ's and HomeBase utilize the efficiencies provided by the warehouse
merchandising format to offer their customers first-quality, brand name
merchandise at prices substantially below those available through traditional
channels of distribution. BJ's and HomeBase both emphasize productivity,
efficiency, and disciplined inventory management in order to minimize the cost
of carrying and handling merchandise. Each employs sophisticated management
information systems to facilitate efficient purchasing, distribution and
pricing of inventory. Both chains purchase most of their merchandise directly
from manufacturers for shipment to individual warehouses or to
consolidation/deconsolidation facilities where truckload shipments are
separated and reassembled for immediate delivery to individual warehouse
stores.
 
 The Company was formed in 1989, when Zayre Corp. (now The TJX Companies, Inc.
("TJX")), as part of its restructuring, combined its BJ's Wholesale Club and
HomeBase divisions to form "Waban Inc." In June 1989, TJX distributed all of
the Company's outstanding common stock to its shareholders on a pro rata basis.
 
BJ'S WHOLESALE CLUB
- -------------------
 
GENERAL
 
 BJ's Wholesale Club introduced the warehouse club concept to New England in
1984 and has since expanded in the New England and Mid-Atlantic states, as well
as in southern Florida. BJ's operates 52 warehouse clubs in twelve states and
has over 2.6 million members. The table below shows BJ's locations by state.

INDUSTRY OVERVIEW
 
 Warehouse clubs typically sell a narrow assortment of food and general
merchandise within a wide range of product categories. In order to achieve high
sales volumes and rapid inventory turnover, merchandise selections are
generally limited to items that are brand name leaders in their categories.
Since warehouse clubs sell a diversified selection of product categories, they
attract customers from a wide range of other traditional wholesale and retail
distribution channels, such as supermarkets, discount stores, office supply
stores, consumer electronics stores, automotive stores and wholesale
distributors and jobbers. The Company believes that it is difficult for these
higher cost channels of distribution to effectively compete with the low prices
offered by warehouse clubs.
 
                                       1
<PAGE>
 
 Warehouse clubs eliminate many of the merchandise handling costs associated
with traditional multi-step distribution channels by purchasing directly from
manufacturers and by storing merchandise on the sales floor rather than in
central warehouses. By operating no-frills, self-service warehouse facilities,
warehouse clubs have fixturing and operating costs substantially below those of
traditional retailers. Warehouse clubs also carry bulk sizes and packaging
generally not available from traditional retailers. Two broad groups of
customers, individual households and small businesses, have been attracted to
the savings on brand name merchandise made possible by the high sales volumes
and low operating costs achieved by warehouse clubs. The customers at warehouse
clubs are generally limited to members who pay an annual fee.
 
 The warehouse club industry has grown from sales of approximately $14 billion
in 1988 to $39 billion in 1993, rapidly gaining market share of both food and
general merchandise sales. The Company believes that there is opportunity for
continued growth in market share. In 1993, the warehouse club industry
accounted for less than 3% of U.S. retail sales and less than 6% of U.S. retail
grocery sales. The Company expects that market share growth will come from the
addition of new clubs as well as from sales growth of existing clubs, primarily
at the expense of more traditional channels of distribution. The Company's
management believes the northeastern United States is underserved by the
warehouse club industry, as compared to other areas of the United States where
warehouse clubs account for a greater percentage of total retail sales.
 
STRATEGY
 
 BJ's strategy is to build on its existing base of 52 warehouse clubs by (i)
opening additional warehouse clubs in markets in the Northeast, (ii) attracting
new members to existing warehouse clubs, and (iii) increasing BJ's share of
members' overall retail spending. BJ's has developed a number of programs to
execute this strategy:
 
 Expand in Existing Markets. BJ's currently plans to open approximately 15 new
warehouse clubs each year over the next several years. The Company expects that
virtually all of these new warehouse clubs will be located in the Northeast,
with particular emphasis during fiscal 1995 on the metropolitan New
York/northern New Jersey market. BJ's new-store strategy is focused on filling
in existing markets, with expansion in future years planned for contiguous
market areas.
 
 Continue to Implement Cost Reductions. Since BJ's appeal is based on its low
prices, BJ's constantly seeks to reduce its operating costs and pass these
savings along to its members. For example, BJ's has made extensive use of
consolidation/deconsolidation facilities to reduce the costs of transporting
and receiving merchandise by breaking down truckload quantity shipments from
manufacturers and re-allocating these goods for shipment, generally on a same-
day basis, to individual BJ's warehouse clubs. BJ's has also achieved
significant cost reductions over the past two years by installing supermarket
style conveyers and sophisticated scanning technology at its checkouts.
 
 Increase Customer Base Through Marketing. BJ's strives to increase customer
awareness of the value provided by the membership warehouse format, as well as
the specific benefits of joining BJ's, through public relations efforts,
marketing programs for new stores, direct mail solicitations and by word-of-
mouth. BJ's also intends to continue to make limited use of television and
radio advertising to increase consumer awareness of its warehouse clubs.
 
 Introduce New Products and Services. To increase its share of each member's
total purchases and the frequency of members' visits and to attract new
customers, BJ's continually introduces new products, services and membership
benefits. For example, in recent years BJ's has introduced fresh meat and
bakery departments, optical centers, lottery ticket counters, an auto buying
service and a travel service.
 
EXPANSION
 
 Over the last six fiscal years BJ's increased the number of its warehouse
clubs from 19 to 52.

 BJ's store opening strategy for fiscal 1995 is focused on filling in existing
markets, with expansion in future years planned for both existing and
contiguous market areas. Although expansion within existing markets may
initially affect sales at existing warehouse clubs adversely, the Company
believes that this strategy increases market penetration by increasing
awareness of BJ's, by attracting new customers to more convenient locations and
by increasing the frequency of shopping by current members. In addition, BJ's
anticipates improving operational efficiencies in distribution costs and
management supervision by concentrating its warehouse clubs geographically.
 
 BJ's employs a team of experienced real estate professionals who are devoted
to identifying sites for future development, as well as a group of project
managers who coordinate the development of BJ's new warehouse club locations.
Many of the markets in which BJ's operates are already heavily developed, and
quality retail sites large enough to accommodate a BJ's warehouse club are
difficult to locate and develop. Zoning, environmental and other regulatory
approvals may also delay or prevent the development of a warehouse club
location. Although the Company believes that it will be able to obtain
sufficient locations to achieve its expansion objectives, there can be no
assurance of its ability to do so.
 
STORE PROFILE
 
 The average size of the 52 BJ's warehouse clubs in operation at January 29,
1994 is approximately 110,000 square feet. Including space for parking, a
typical BJ's warehouse club requires eight to ten acres of land. BJ's warehouse
clubs are located in both free-standing locations and "strip malls." In some
locations, BJ's warehouse clubs are combined with other large store retailers
in shopping centers known as power centers.
 
 Construction and site development costs for a new BJ's warehouse club average
$4.9 million. Land acquisition costs for a warehouse club generally range from
$2.5 million to $5.5 million, but can be significantly higher in some
locations. A new BJ's warehouse club entails an initial capital investment of
approximately $2.0 million for fixtures and equipment. In addition to capital
expenditures, each new warehouse club requires approximately $2.0 million for
inventory (net of accounts payable) and pre-opening expenses.
 
MERCHANDISING
 
 BJ's merchandising strategy is to provide its members with a broad range of
high quality, brand name merchandise offered at everyday prices consistently
lower than the prices available through traditional wholesalers, discount
retailers or supermarkets. An important element of this strategy is to carry
only those products for which the Company can provide its customers significant
cost savings. BJ's limits specific items in each product line to fast selling
styles, sizes and colors and, therefore, carries an average of approximately
3,500 stock-keeping units ("SKUs"). By contrast, supermarkets normally stock
18,000 to 35,000 SKUs.
 
 In recent years, food has become an increasing percentage of BJ's sales mix
and currently represents approximately 60% of sales. The remaining 40% consists
of a wide variety of non-food items. Food categories at BJ's include frozen
foods, meat and dairy products, dry grocery items, fresh produce and canned
goods. BJ's offers fresh meat and bakery departments in nearly all its clubs.
General merchandise includes office supplies, office equipment, televisions,
stereos, small appliances, auto accessories, tires, jewelry, cleaning supplies,
paper goods, housewares and apparel.
 
 BJ's continually strives to add new departments, services and membership
benefits to attract new members and to generate incremental sales from existing
members. In recent years, for example, BJ's has introduced fresh meat and
bakery departments, optical centers, lottery ticket counters, an auto buying
service and a travel service. BJ's works closely with manufacturers to develop
packaging and sizes which are best suited to selling through the warehouse club
format in order to minimize handling costs and to provide increased value to
its members.
 
 To ensure that its merchandise selection is closely attuned to the tastes of
its members, BJ's employs regional buyers, each of whom is responsible for
tailoring the product selection in individual warehouse clubs to the regional
and ethnic tastes of the local market.
 
MEMBERSHIP
 
 Paid membership is an integral part of the warehouse club concept. In addition
to providing a source of revenue which permits the Company to offer low prices,
membership also reinforces customer loyalty and acts as a screening device,
allowing BJ's to concentrate on serving high volume repeat customers. BJ's
internal
 
                                       3
<PAGE>
 
demographic studies indicate that its customers are more likely to be home
owners and tend to have incomes, ages and family sizes which are above the
average for its trading areas. BJ's has two primary types of members: business
members and Inner Circle (household) members. At January 29, 1994, the Company
had over 2.6 million members (including supplemental cardholders).
 
 BJ's has generally charged an annual membership fee for individuals and
qualified businesses of $25 for the primary membership card, plus an additional
$10 for each supplemental card. The Company has recently changed this policy
and, in March 1994, began charging $30 for the primary membership card and will
provide one free supplemental card to each primary member. The Company believes
that its new fee structure will be competitive within the industry, will
increase the Company's aggregate number of members, and is designed to increase
the level of spending by each family or small business member. Additional
supplemental cards now cost $15 each. BJ's membership policy is less
restrictive than certain of its competitors, who require individual members to
belong to certain qualifying groups. The Company believes that its more liberal
membership policy is beneficial in helping it to expand awareness of the
warehouse club concept and has attracted incremental sales without adversely
affecting its costs.
 
 BJ's permits members to pay for their purchases by cash, check or Discover
card. In addition, the Company recently introduced a BJ's credit card, which is
provided by a major financial institution on a non-recourse basis. BJ's does
not accept other national credit cards because of their high fee structure.
 
ADVERTISING
 
 BJ's increases customer awareness of its warehouse clubs primarily through
public relations efforts, new store marketing programs and direct mail
solicitations. BJ's employs a team of dedicated marketing personnel who solicit
potential business members and who contact selected community groups to
increase the number of members. BJ's also uses one-day passes to introduce non-
members to its warehouse clubs.
 
 BJ's policy is generally to limit advertising and promotional expenses to new
warehouse club openings and to utilize print and electronic media advertising
sparingly. In 1993, the Company used limited vendor-funded television and radio
advertising during the holiday season. These policies result in very low
marketing expenses as compared to typical discount retailers and supermarkets.
 
WAREHOUSE CLUB OPERATIONS
 
 The Company's ability to achieve profitable operations while offering high
quality merchandise at low prices depends upon the efficient operation of its
warehouse clubs and high sales volumes. The Company's principal methods of
achieving operating efficiencies include the following:
 
 Efficient Merchandise Handling. BJ's buys virtually all of its merchandise at
volume discounts from manufacturers for shipment either directly to BJ's
warehouse clubs or to a consolidation/deconsolidation facility. As a result,
BJ's eliminates many of the costs associated with traditional multiple-step
distribution channels, including distributors' commissions and the costs of
storing merchandise in central distribution facilities.
 
 BJ's routes a significant percentage of its non-food merchandise as well as an
increasing percentage of food purchases through consolidation/deconsolidation
facilities which break down truckload quantity shipments from manufacturers and
re-allocate these goods for shipment, generally on a same-day basis, to
individual warehouse clubs. Having vendors ship to these
consolidation/deconsolidation facilities permits BJ's to negotiate better
volume discounts and reduces freight expense by combining full truckload
merchandise shipments from different vendors to individual warehouse clubs. In
addition, by receiving and processing merchandise at a central point, BJ's
reduces the number of trucks received at each warehouse club and related
receiving costs. BJ's believes that its strategy of opening additional
warehouse clubs within existing markets will permit it to achieve further
efficiencies at its existing consolidation/deconsolidation facilities.
 
 BJ's works closely with manufacturers to minimize the amount of handling
required once merchandise is received at a warehouse club. Most merchandise is
pre-marked by the manufacturer with the universal product code (UPC) so that it
does not require ticketing at the warehouse club. In addition, BJ's minimizes
labor costs because its warehouse clubs are self-serve. Merchandise for sale is
displayed on pallets containing large quantities of each item, thereby reducing
labor required for handling, stocking and restocking. Back-up merchandise is
generally stored on racks above the sales floor. BJ's goal is to keep at least
one day's supply of each item on the selling floor.
 
                                       4
<PAGE>
 
 Minimal Shrinkage. BJ's has been able to limit inventory losses to levels well
below those typical of discount retailers by strictly controlling the exits of
its warehouse clubs, by generally limiting customers to members and by using
state-of-the-art electronic article surveillance. Problems associated with
payments by check have also been insignificant, since the memberships of
customers who issue dishonored checks are terminated. Also, bank information
from business members is verified prior to the establishment of check purchase
limits.
 
 Reduced Working Capital Requirements. In order to generate rapid inventory
turnover, BJ's limits total inventories per warehouse club to an average of
approximately 3,500 active SKUs. As a result of its high sales volume and rapid
inventory turnover, BJ's has the opportunity to sell a substantial portion of
its inventory before it is required to pay vendors for such merchandise. As
sales in a given warehouse club increase and inventory turnover becomes more
rapid, a greater percentage of the inventory is financed through payment terms
provided by vendors rather than with working capital.
 
MANAGEMENT INFORMATION SYSTEMS
 
 Over the past three years, BJ's has made a significant investment in enhancing
the efficiency with which it handles purchases and captures sales information.
While BJ's originally followed the traditional warehouse club model of a two-
person team at the checkout counter -- a cashier plus a "caller" who read out
SKU numbers and physically transferred merchandise -- BJ's was the first
warehouse club to eliminate the caller position by introducing scanning devices
which work in conjunction with its electronic point of sale (EPOS) terminals.
Sales data from the EPOS terminals is continually transmitted to a minicomputer
in the warehouse club and transmitted daily to a mainframe computer which
provides detailed sales information to the Company's management and merchants.
BJ's utilizes a sophisticated merchandise replenishment algorithm to suggest
quantities to be re-ordered, which are then monitored daily by BJ's buying
staff. BJ's fully integrated MIS system also maintains detailed purchasing data
on individual members, permitting BJ's merchants and store managers to track
changes in members' buying behavior.
 
COMPETITION
 
 BJ's competes with a wide range of national, regional and local retailers and
wholesalers selling food or general merchandise in its markets, including
supermarkets, general merchandise chains, specialty chains and other warehouse
clubs, several of which have significantly greater financial and marketing
resources than the Company. Major competitors that operate warehouse clubs
include Price/Costco Inc. and Sam's Clubs (a division of Wal-Mart Stores,
Inc.). Price/Costco was formed in October 1993 by the merger of Costco
Wholesale Corporation and The Price Company, Inc., two large operators of
membership warehouse clubs. A majority of the units of another major operator
of warehouse clubs, Pace Membership Warehouse, Inc., were recently acquired by
Wal-Mart and combined with its Sam's division.
 
 A large number of competitive membership warehouse clubs have opened in the
Northeast within the last two years. Forty-eight of BJ's 52 warehouse clubs
have at least one competitive membership warehouse club in their trading areas
at an average distance of approximately 6 miles. The influx of competitors'
units (as well as the addition of new BJ's warehouse clubs) over the past two
years has had an adverse effect on BJ's comparable stores' sales. While the
Company expects additional competition to continue for at least the next fiscal
year, it expects the pace of competitive openings will be lower than it has
been in the past two years, in part due to the recent industry consolidation.
Also, as a result of this consolidation, a number of former Pace warehouse
clubs and Price/Costco warehouse clubs have ceased operation in BJ's trading
areas.
 
 The Company believes price is the major competitive factor in the markets in
which BJ's competes. Other competitive factors include store location,
merchandise selection and name recognition. The Company believes that its
efficient, low cost form of distribution gives it a significant competitive
advantage compared to more traditional channels of wholesale and retail
distribution. As a regional chain, BJ's strives to differentiate itself from
other membership warehouse club operators by its attention to local buying
preferences and seasonality.

INDUSTRY OVERVIEW
 
 Warehouse-format home centers typically provide lower prices compared to
traditional channels of home improvement and building supply product
distribution. The warehouse format also generally offers a very broad
assortment of home improvement products, combined with a high level of service
from knowledgeable, well trained warehouse staff. These factors are
communicated to customers through ongoing, aggressive advertising.
 
 The warehouse format generally serves two broad customer groups within the
home improvement industry. The first group consists of Do-It-Yourself (DIY)
customers who are individuals and families that are making purchases and
completing projects generally for their own homes on a Do-It-Yourself basis.
These customers range from casual to serious, and require varying levels of
support in planning and selecting their purchases. The second customer group
consists of professional contractors and facility managers who use home
improvement and building supply products on a daily basis in their businesses.
 
 The Company believes that demographic and lifestyle factors such as the aging
of baby boomers, the increase in home-centered activities and the aging housing
stock will create growing demand for home improvement products and services.
The Company believes that the overall market for home improvement products was
approximately $115 billion in calendar 1993. The market for home improvement
products is fragmented, with the five largest home improvement retailers
representing approximately 20% of sales in 1992, and the top 100 operators
representing less than 40% of sales.
 
 Over the last ten years, warehouse-format home center retailers have gained
significant market share in the United States by offering lower prices, greater
product selection and more in-stock merchandise than traditional home center,
hardware and lumber yard operators. In addition, warehouse stores have been
able to take advantage of economies created by large sales volumes. Despite the
significant growth of warehouse-format home centers in recent years, the
Company believes that this format represented less than 15% of the overall
market in 1993.
 
STRATEGY
 
 Over the past three years, HomeBase has redirected its marketing focus to
attract a wider range of customers. Originally developed as a "membership
warehouse club" for the home improvement industry,
 
                                       6
<PAGE>
 
HomeBase (then known as "HomeClub") appealed primarily to those customers
requiring little assistance and a limited assortment of products at low prices.
Recognizing that this strategy was not addressing a large portion of the market
for Do-It-Yourself merchandise, HomeBase discontinued its membership
requirement, changed its name and broadened its merchandise assortment while
retaining the operating efficiencies inherent in the warehouse format.
 
 HomeBase is currently implementing a series of strategic initiatives designed
to strengthen its market position in the western United States and improve its
profitability. These initiatives include (i) a significant increase in the
level of customer service offered at HomeBase stores, through an increase in
the number of salespeople, including hiring experienced tradespeople and others
with specialized product knowledge in home improvement fields, and enhanced
sales and service training for both new and existing store employees, (ii)
improvement in gross margin through buying efficiencies created by
centralization of the merchandise replenishment function, improved distribution
of merchandise to reduce freight costs, and selective price increases, and
(iii) an aggressive marketing program to communicate to customers the benefits
of shopping at HomeBase and its improved levels of customer service. In the
third quarter of fiscal 1994, a new management team, led by a senior executive
from BJ's, was installed at HomeBase to implement these strategic initiatives.
 
 The new management team also undertook a thorough review of HomeBase's
business and real estate strategies, the result of which was a recommendation
to take certain actions in a restructuring plan, which the Company's Board of
Directors approved on November 15, 1993. Consequently, in the fourth quarter of
fiscal 1994, the Company recorded a pre-tax restructuring charge of $101.1
million primarily to cover expenses related to the repositioning of HomeBase.
The restructuring is designed to enable HomeBase to focus its management
efforts and financial resources on strengthening its competitive position in
the western United States. This charge reflects (i) the closing of all eight of
the Company's stores in midwestern markets (Chicago and Toledo), which were
outside HomeBase's primary market area, (ii) the planned closing of 16
additional stores where the potential to achieve the Company's objectives is
limited, and (iii) liquidating certain discontinued merchandise. The Company
closed the eight stores in the Midwest in January 1994 and has disposed of five
of these locations. The Company is actively seeking to sell, assign or sublease
the remaining three midwestern stores, as well as the other 16 stores
identified for closing.
 
 The following are critical elements of HomeBase's strategy for growth:
 
 Provide Superior Customer Service. HomeBase believes that a high level of
customer service is required to build both customer loyalty and sales. To
improve its level of customer service, HomeBase added a significant number of
sales and service personnel in the fourth quarter of fiscal 1994. Many of the
recently hired personnel are tradespeople or specialists trained in particular
merchandise categories who will be able to provide knowledgeable assistance to
customers. HomeBase has also reoriented its training programs to emphasize the
importance of customer service and to focus sales personnel on becoming
knowledgeable specialists in particular areas of home improvement. By
increasing customer contact with knowledgeable tradespeople and trained
specialists, HomeBase believes that it will be able to raise its level of
customer service, thereby broadening its appeal both to DIY and professional
customers.
 
 Increase Customer Awareness. The Company is undertaking an aggressive
marketing program to attract new customers by emphasizing HomeBase's enhanced
commitment to customer service, its broad product selection, high quality
merchandise and everyday low prices. This program will supplement HomeBase's
regular print advertising with the extensive use of television advertising.
 
 Build Customer Know-How. HomeBase believes that it is important not only to
address the needs of the existing DIY marketplace, but that it is also
important to expand the DIY marketplace by encouraging new DIY customers and
upgrading the skills and confidence levels of existing DIY customers. HomeBase
provides assistance and training to DIY customers, including regularly
scheduled customer clinics on a wide range of home improvement projects.
 
 Serve the Professional. HomeBase has designed a series of programs to
specifically address the needs of contractors. A majority of HomeBase warehouse
stores have Contractor Desks, with staff dedicated to handling contractors'
special needs, including the ability to receive faxed orders and pre-assemble
them for pick-up, and quickly obtaining special items and sizes. HomeBase will
also deliver bulk purchases to job sites for a nominal fee. HomeBase warehouse
stores offer extended hours, opening early in the morning to serve professional
contractors.

EXPANSION
 
 HomeBase is currently the largest or second largest home improvement operator
in most of the metropolitan markets which it serves. HomeBase's current
expansion strategy is oriented towards reinforcing its position in these
existing markets and expanding selectively to contiguous markets.
 
 The following table shows the number of HomeBase stores opened and closed in
the last six years:

</TABLE>
 
 As of October 30, 1993, HomeBase operated 90 warehouse stores. As part of the
repositioning of HomeBase, the Company closed eight stores in the Midwest in
January 1994, resulting in 82 stores in operation at the end of fiscal 1994.
The Company has also announced its plans to close an additional 16 warehouse
stores. In fiscal 1995, HomeBase plans to open approximately four warehouse
stores, which will be located in existing market areas.
 
STORE PROFILE
 
 The average size of the 82 HomeBase warehouse stores in operation at January
29, 1994 was 101,000 square feet. Most HomeBase warehouse stores also utilize
additional outside selling space for nursery and garden centers. HomeBase's
warehouse stores are located in both free-standing locations and "strip malls."
In some locations, HomeBase warehouse stores are combined with membership
warehouse clubs or other large store retailers in shopping centers known as
power centers.
 
 Including space for parking, a typical HomeBase warehouse store requires six
to ten acres of land. Construction and site development costs for a new
HomeBase warehouse store average $5.1 million. Land acquisition costs for a new
warehouse store generally range from $2.0 million to $6.0 million. A new
HomeBase warehouse store entails an initial capital investment of approximately
$1.5 million for fixtures and equipment. In addition to capital expenditures,
each new warehouse store requires an investment of approximately $2.5 million
for inventory (net of accounts payable) and pre-opening expenses.
 
MERCHANDISING
 
 HomeBase's large product offering provides a broad selection of brand name
merchandise to both DIY customers and professional contractors. HomeBase's
merchandise selection is broad enough to allow a customer to purchase virtually
every item needed to build an entire home. The Company believes that its 25,000
SKU selection is broader than the selection offered by traditional home center
competitors.
 
 By making use of the operating efficiencies of the warehouse format to
maximize productivity, HomeBase believes it is able to provide substantial
savings over other channels of home improvement and building supply product
distribution. In order to achieve greater operational efficiencies, HomeBase
has recently centralized its merchandise replenishment operations and improved
its logistics of distribution to reduce freight costs. By centralizing its
replenishment activities, the Company believes it will be able to improve the
manner in which it acquires products. In addition, this program will permit the
Company to redeploy store personnel, which will increase customer service.
 
 Merchandise sold by HomeBase includes lumber, building materials, plumbing
supplies and fixtures, electrical materials and fixtures, hand and power tools,
hardware, paints, garden supplies, nursery items, home decorative items and
related seasonal and household merchandise. HomeBase's name brand orientation
allows customers to compare HomeBase's prices to the same items offered by
competitors. In selected categories, HomeBase supplements these name brand
offerings with high quality private label products at lower prices. As part of
its restructuring, in the fourth quarter of fiscal 1994, HomeBase discontinued
certain
 
                                       8
<PAGE>
 
merchandise unrelated to its core home improvement offerings. In addition,
HomeBase raised prices on selected merchandise items to the lower end of the
range of prices offered by competitors in the relevant trading area.
 
MARKETING AND ADVERTISING
 
 HomeBase addresses its primary target customers through a mix of newspaper,
direct mail, radio and television advertising. The primary advertising medium
is newspaper advertisements, including both freestanding inserts and run-of-
press ads. Television and radio advertising are used to reinforce HomeBase's
image of providing superior customer service and offering a broad assortment of
merchandise at everyday low prices. Additionally, the Company participates in
or hosts a variety of home shows, customer hospitality events and contractor
product shows. HomeBase solicits vendor participation in many of its
advertising programs. The Company has recently commenced an aggressive
marketing program to attract new customers by emphasizing HomeBase's enhanced
commitment to customer service, its broad product selection, high quality
merchandise and everyday low prices.
 
WAREHOUSE OPERATIONS
 
 Customer Service. HomeBase is committed to providing superior service to every
customer. Carefully selected home improvement specialists, many of whom have
extensive experience in their respective fields, are available throughout the
store to assist DIY customers and professional contractors.
 
 The HomeBase warehouse is designed to serve both the contractor and DIY
markets. HomeBase's project design centers and kitchen design centers feature
computer assisted design tools where customers can work with design
coordinators to conceptualize and plan virtually any home improvement project.
HomeBase's contractor desk, with its dedicated staff, permits the contractor to
take advantage of the breadth of HomeBase's offerings in a timely manner.
Complemented by HomeBase's delivery capability, the HomeBase contractor desk
strives to be the "supplier of first choice" to the professional contractor
market.
 
 Training. HomeBase strives to develop the skills of its store personnel to
ensure that customers consistently receive knowledgeable and courteous
assistance. HomeBase's training programs have been recently reoriented to
emphasize the importance of customer service and to improve store employees'
selling skills. HomeBase provides extensive training for its entry level
warehouse store personnel through a comprehensive in-house training program
that combines on-the-job training with formal seminars and meetings. On an
ongoing basis, warehouse store personnel attend frequent in-house training
sessions conducted by HomeBase's training staff or by manufacturers'
representatives, and they receive sales, product and other information in
frequent meetings with their managers. HomeBase's satellite television system
(HBTV) permits it to simultaneously broadcast training sessions from its
Irvine, California headquarters to every individual warehouse store location.
 
 Low Cost Operation. HomeBase purchases most of its merchandise directly from
manufacturers for shipment either directly to the selling warehouse store or to
consolidation/deconsolidation facilities where large shipments are broken down
and separated for transfer to individual warehouse stores, generally on a same-
day basis. By operating no-frills warehouse facilities, HomeBase's fixturing
and operating costs are kept substantially below those of traditional home
improvement retailers.
 
 Credit. HomeBase offers its own private label credit card to customers under a
non-recourse program operated by a major financial institution. The Company
plans to introduce a similar third party program directed toward professional
contractors. HomeBase also accepts MasterCard, Visa, Discover and American
Express.
 
MANAGEMENT INFORMATION SYSTEMS
 
 HomeBase uses a fully integrated management information system to monitor
sales, track inventory and provide rapid feedback on the performance of its
business. These systems are designed to enhance HomeBase's "quick response"
capability. Each HomeBase warehouse store operates point-of-sale terminals
which capture information on each item sold via UPC scanning. Minicomputers at
each warehouse store process and consolidate this information during the
selling day and transmit it each night to HomeBase's information center via
satellite. From this information, the data center produces daily reports that
are used to support merchandising, inventory replenishment and promotional
decisions.
 
                                       9
<PAGE>
 
 HomeBase's satellite television network broadcasts several times each week to
all of HomeBase's warehouse stores. Broadcasts include training sessions,
vendor product demonstrations and interactive discussions with HomeBase's
management.
 
 HomeBase introduced scanning to the home improvement industry and is a leader
in implementing electronic data interchange ("EDI"). EDI permits both HomeBase
and its vendors to save money and reduce errors by electronically transmitting
purchase order information. HomeBase now uses EDI with over 700 vendors and
plans to expand its use of this technology.
 
COMPETITION
 
 HomeBase competes with a wide range of businesses engaged in the wholesale or
retail sale of home improvement and building supply merchandise, including home
centers, hardware stores, lumber yards and discount stores. The Company
believes the major competitive factors in the markets in which HomeBase
competes are customer service, price, product selection, location and name
recognition. The Company believes that its improving level of customer service,
the value offered by HomeBase's low prices and the one-stop shopping available
through its full range of home improvement products give it an advantage over
many of its traditional home center competitors. Major competitors in
HomeBase's market areas that also use the warehouse merchandising format
include The Home Depot, Inc. and Builder's Square Inc. (a subsidiary of Kmart
Corporation). Approximately 70% of HomeBase's warehouse stores currently have
at least one warehouse home improvement retailer in their trading areas at an
average distance of approximately 3 miles. Approximately 60% of HomeBase's
warehouse stores currently compete with Home Depot units. HomeBase also
competes with a number of smaller regional operators such as Orchard Lumber
Supply, Contractor's Warehouse (a division of Grossman's Inc.) and Eagle
Hardware & Garden, Inc. Some of the Company's competitors have significantly
greater financial and marketing resources than the Company.
 
EMPLOYEES
- ---------
 
 As of January 29, 1994, the Company had approximately 16,000 employees, of

ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND
       RESULTS OF OPERATIONS
 
RESULTS OF OPERATIONS
 
 GENERAL
 
 The Company believes that stores using a warehouse merchandising format are
continuing to gain an increasing share of both the food and general
merchandise market, in which BJ's operates, and the home improvement market,
in which HomeBase operates. To compete effectively in these markets, warehouse
operators need to maintain a low cost structure and be able to offer customers
a diversified selection of merchandise at attractive prices. The Company
believes that it has established efficient operations at both BJ's and
HomeBase that enable the Company to minimize its costs and to provide
increased value to customers.
 
 In fiscal 1993 (the year ended January 30, 1993), the Company achieved sales
growth at both BJ's and HomeBase, primarily through the opening of new stores
and also from comparable store sales growth. In fiscal 1994 (the year ended
January 29, 1994), the Company's sales growth was attributable to new store
openings. Comparable store sales, on a same-week basis, decreased at both BJ's
and HomeBase from fiscal 1993 to fiscal 1994. The decrease at BJ's was due
largely to increased competition from other warehouse club operators; the
effects of opening new BJ's stores in the trading areas of existing BJ's
warehouse clubs; the effects of price deflation, particularly in food
products; and the weak economic conditions in the Northeast. The decrease at
HomeBase was due largely to increased competition and the depressed economic
conditions in its major markets, particularly California.
 
 BJ's strategy is to continue to strengthen its market position in the
northeastern United States by opening additional warehouse clubs, attracting
new members to existing warehouse clubs and increasing BJ's share of members'
overall retail spending.
 
 HomeBase is currently implementing a series of strategic initiatives designed
to strengthen its market position in the western United States and improve its
profitability. These initiatives include (i) a significant increase in the
level of customer service offered at HomeBase warehouse stores, through an
increase in the number of salespeople, including hiring of experienced
tradespeople and others with specialized product knowledge in home improvement
fields, and enhanced sales and service training for both new and existing
store employees, (ii) improvement in gross margin through efficiencies created
by the centralization of the merchandise replenishment function, improved
distribution of merchandise to reduce freight costs and selective price
increases, and (iii) an aggressive marketing program to communicate to
customers the benefits of shopping at HomeBase and its improved levels of
customer service. In the third quarter of fiscal 1994, a new management team,
led by a senior executive from BJ's, was installed at HomeBase to implement
these strategic initiatives.
 
 The new management team also undertook a thorough review of HomeBase's
business and real estate strategies, the result of which was a recommendation
to take certain actions in a restructuring plan, which the Company's Board of
Directors approved on November 15, 1993. Consequently, in the fourth quarter
of fiscal 1994, the Company recorded a pre-tax restructuring charge of $101.1
million primarily to cover expenses related to the repositioning of HomeBase.
The restructuring is designed to enable HomeBase to focus its management
efforts and financial resources on strengthening its competitive position in
the western United States. This charge reflects (i) the closing of all eight
of the Company's stores in midwestern markets (Chicago and Toledo), which were
outside of HomeBase's primary market area, (ii) the planned closing of 16
additional stores where the potential to achieve the Company's objectives is
limited, and (iii) liquidating certain discontinued merchandise. The Company
closed the eight stores in the Midwest in January 1994 and has disposed of
five of these locations. The Company is actively seeking to sell, assign or
sublease the remaining three midwestern locations as well as the other 16
stores identified for closing.
 
 The results at HomeBase for fiscal 1994 exclude sales and operating income or
losses since October 31, 1993 for the eight midwestern HomeBase warehouse
stores that have closed and since November 28, 1993 for the other 16 HomeBase
warehouse stores planned to be closed. Sales from all 24 warehouse stores have
been removed from comparable store sales.
 
                                      14
<PAGE>
 
 The disposition of the 24 HomeBase stores is expected to generate a
significant amount of cash flow (see "Liquidity and Capital Resources") and to
improve HomeBase's operating income. If the results of the 24 stores had been
excluded for the full year ended January 29, 1994, sales would have been
reduced by approximately $270 million and operating income would have been
increased by approximately $8 million.
 
 The Company is finding it increasingly necessary to acquire and develop,
rather than lease from third parties, new store sites. As a result, the
Company's requirements for capital have increased, and store openings more
frequently result in increased capital expenditures and related interest and
depreciation expense rather than rental expense.

 Total sales of the Company increased by 6.9% from fiscal 1993 (which contained
53 weeks) to fiscal 1994 and by 20.6% from fiscal 1992 to fiscal 1993. The
increases in both years were due primarily to the opening of new warehouse
stores. Comparable store sales increases (decreases) on a same-week basis for
the last two fiscal years were as follows:

           BJ's Wholesale Club     (9.9%)       3.9%
           HomeBase                (1.5%)       2.0%
           Total                   (6.4%)       2.9%
</TABLE>
 
 Comparable store sales at BJ's, on a same-week basis, decreased 9.9% from
fiscal 1993 to fiscal 1994, and during fiscal 1993 comparable store sales at
BJ's declined from double-digit increases in the first quarter to decreases in
the fourth quarter. These decreases were due largely to increased competition
from other warehouse club operators; the effects of opening new BJ's warehouse
clubs in the trading areas of existing BJ's warehouse clubs; the effects of
price deflation, particularly in food products; and the weak economic
conditions in the Northeast.
 
 HomeBase's comparable store sales, on a same-week basis, decreased 1.5% from
fiscal 1993 to fiscal 1994, following an increase of 2.0% from fiscal 1992 to
fiscal 1993. The decrease at HomeBase in fiscal 1994 was due largely to
increased competition and the depressed economic conditions in its major
markets, particularly California.
 
 Cost of sales (including buying and occupancy costs) as a percentage of sales
was 86.0% in fiscal 1994, compared with 85.8% in fiscal 1993 and 86.2% in
fiscal 1992. The increase in the percentage from fiscal 1993 to fiscal 1994 was
attributable primarily to the increased proportion of consolidated sales
contributed by BJ's, which is a lower margin business than HomeBase. Gross
selling margins increased at both divisions from fiscal 1993 to fiscal 1994,
particularly at BJ's. The decrease in cost of sales as a percentage of sales
from fiscal 1992 to fiscal 1993 was due mainly to higher gross selling margins
at HomeBase.
 
 Selling, general and administrative ("SG&A") expenses as a percentage of sales
were 11.8% in fiscal 1994 versus 12.0% in fiscal 1993 and 11.6% in fiscal 1992.
The ratio of SG&A expenses to sales was lower in fiscal 1994 than in fiscal
1993 mainly because of BJ's increased proportion of consolidated sales, and
operating efficiencies and improvements in expense controls at BJ's. SG&A
expenses as a percentage of sales are lower at BJ's than at HomeBase, which
offers a higher level of customer service. The increase in the SG&A ratio from
fiscal 1992 to fiscal 1993 was attributable primarily to higher payroll and
preopening expenses at HomeBase. The Company expects that its SG&A expenses
will increase in fiscal 1995 as a result of hiring a significant number of
additional customer service personnel at its HomeBase warehouse stores.
 
 The Company's $101.1 million pre-tax restructuring charge in fiscal 1994
relates primarily to store closings and the write-down of discontinued
inventory at HomeBase. The main components of this charge were:
 
 1) Operating losses and store closing costs (excluding employee termination
    costs) were estimated to be approximately $31.3 million. This charge
    comprises the actual losses and costs of the eight midwestern HomeBase
    warehouse stores from the beginning of November 1993 through their
    closing at the end of January 1994, and the estimated losses and costs of
    16 other warehouse stores from the beginning of December 1993 through
    their anticipated closings in the fiscal year ending in January 1995.
 
 2) Employee termination costs were estimated to be approximately $3.6
    million, including severance pay and postemployment medical expenses.
 
 3) The net book value of HomeBase property to be disposed of was written
    down by approximately $17.4 million. This charge represents the
    difference between the net book value of owned real estate, leasehold
    improvements and furniture, fixtures and equipment to be disposed of and
    the estimated proceeds to be realized from their sale.
 
 4) Contract termination costs were estimated to be approximately $36.9
    million. This charge primarily represents HomeBase's obligations for
    leased properties after their closing date offset by estimated sublease
    income expected to be realized, net of expenses.
 
 5) The write-down to net realizable value of inventory being discontinued
    because it is not related to HomeBase's core home improvement merchandise
    was estimated to be approximately $9.8 million.
 
 The Company's restructuring charge was based on a number of estimates, and the
actual loss could vary from these estimates, depending on certain factors,
principally the Company's ability to sublease, assign or sell closed HomeBase
locations on favorable terms.

 BJ's operating income of $45.2 million in fiscal 1994 included a pre-tax
charge of $2.2 million for the estimated expenses related to the relocation of
the BJ's Wholesale Club in Syracuse, New York. BJ's fiscal 1993 operating
income of $35.4 million included a $1.1 million pre-tax gain from the disposal
of real estate properties. BJ's operating income of $17.4 million in fiscal
1992 included a pre-tax charge of $5.5 million for closing the four BJ's clubs
in Chicago. Excluding these items, operating income at BJ's was $47.4 million,
or 2.4% of sales, in fiscal 1994, compared with $34.3 million, or 1.9% of
sales, in fiscal 1993 and $22.9 million, or 1.6% of sales, in fiscal 1992. The
improvement in operating income over the three-year period is due to
productivity gains in the movement of merchandise, a shift in the mix of sales
to higher margin categories, operating efficiencies in the warehouse clubs and
improvements in expense controls.
 
 HomeBase posted an operating loss of $55.8 million in fiscal 1994, which
included a pre-tax restructuring charge of $98.5 million. Excluding this charge
from fiscal 1994, and excluding a fiscal 1992 charge of $3.4 million for
changing HomeBase's name from "HomeClub," operating income at HomeBase was
$42.7 million, or 2.7% of sales, in fiscal 1994, $47.2 million, or 3.0% of
sales, in fiscal 1993 and $45.5 million, or 3.4% of sales, in fiscal 1992.
Increased payroll and occupancy costs in fiscal 1994, partially offset by
decreased advertising and preopening costs, accounted for the decrease in
operating income from fiscal 1993 to fiscal 1994. The increase in operating
income from fiscal 1992 to fiscal 1993 was attributable to improved gross
merchandise margins, offset by higher payroll and preopening expenses.
 
 The components of net interest expense in the last three fiscal years were as
follows (in millions):

 Interest on debt, net of interest and investment income, increased in each of
the last two years because of the borrowing of $60.0 million through a private
placement of 9.58% senior notes in June 1991 and $108.6 million through a
public offering of 6.5% subordinated convertible debentures in July 1992 and
the subsequent investment of these funds in the expansion of the Company's
businesses. For additional information, see "Liquidity and Capital Resources"
below.
 
 The Company's income tax benefit was 45.0% of its pre-tax loss in fiscal 1994.
This compares with income tax provisions of 35.2% of pre-tax income in fiscal
1993 and 38.7% of pre-tax income in fiscal 1992. During the Company's third
quarter of fiscal 1994, the statutory federal income tax rate for corporations
was raised from 34% to 35%, retroactive to January 1, 1993, and the Targeted
Jobs Tax Credit was restored retroactive to July 1, 1992. The net effect of the
tax law changes on the Company's provision (benefit) for income taxes, which
was recorded in the third quarter of fiscal 1994, was not material. The
Company's provision for income taxes in fiscal 1994 includes 38.2% of pre-tax
income before the restructuring charge and a 40.5% tax benefit from the
restructuring charge. Fiscal 1993's tax rate was favorably impacted by a
benefit resulting from the difference in the book and tax bases of real estate
which was sold, and by an increase in Targeted Jobs Tax Credits over the
previous fiscal year. See Note F of Notes to the Consolidated Financial
Statements for additional information.
 
 In the first quarter of fiscal 1994, the Company adopted Statement of
Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 109, "Accounting for Income Taxes,"
SFAS No. 106, "Employers' Accounting for Postretirement Benefits Other Than
Pensions," and SFAS No. 112, "Employers' Accounting for Postemployment
Benefits." The cumulative effect of these accounting principle changes
increased (decreased) after-tax income by the following amounts (in millions):

 Barring a significant change in tax rates, which would affect the Company's
accrual for deferred income taxes, the Company believes that the ongoing effect
of adopting SFAS Nos. 106, 109 and 112 will not be material. (See Notes F and H
of Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.)

 Excluding the items in the preceding table from the respective periods, net
income for fiscal 1994 was $43.4 million, or $1.27 per share, fully diluted,
compared to $41.9 million, or $1.25 per share, in fiscal 1993 and $35.4
million, or $1.19 per share, in fiscal 1992.
 
LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES
 
 In fiscal 1994, the Company opened 13 BJ's and five HomeBase stores. Cash
expended for property additions was $132.0 million versus $164.9 million in
fiscal 1993, when the Company opened a total of 23 stores. Ten of the new
stores opened in fiscal 1994 were owned versus seven in fiscal 1993. The
Company is increasingly required to acquire and develop, rather than lease from
third parties, sites for new stores.
 
 The Company expects to open approximately 15 additional BJ's (including the
relocation of one warehouse club) and four additional HomeBase warehouse stores
in fiscal 1995. Capital expenditures are planned to be approximately $165
million, including an estimated $100 million for new store real estate. The
timing and amount of actual openings and expenditures could vary from these
estimates due to the complexity of the real estate development process.
 
 During fiscal 1994, the Company reduced its average merchandise inventories
per warehouse store from $4.2 million at January 30, 1993 to $3.8 million at
January 29, 1994, including the effect of a $9.7 million reserve for write-down
of discontinued inventory. Cash provided by the reduction of inventories, net
of accounts payable, was $24.3 million in fiscal 1994 compared with a net cash
outflow for these items of $83.4 million in fiscal 1993.
 
 The Company's restructuring is expected to generate a significant amount of
cash flow. The total pre-tax restructuring charge of $101.1 million includes
approximately $27 million for write-downs of property and inventory, which are
non-cash charges. In addition to tax benefits, cash flow will be generated by
the sale of inventory and property in the stores to be closed (net of accounts
payable and closing costs) and from the liquidation of HomeBase's discontinued
inventory. The initial phase of the restructuring, including the disposition of
all warehouse store locations and merchandise inventories, is expected to
result in $90 million to $100 million of cash inflow (including tax benefits).
The net cash outflow for long-term lease obligations (net of tax benefits)
after closing these locations is estimated to be $15 million to $20 million
over the remaining terms of the leases. The terms of these leases expire at
various dates through 2012. The actual amount of cash flow could vary from
these estimates, depending on certain factors, principally the Company's
ability to sublease or sell closed HomeBase locations on favorable terms.
 
 As of January 29, 1994, the balance of the current portion of the
restructuring reserve liability was $29.4 million and the noncurrent
restructuring reserve liability was $28.6 million. Merchandise inventories were
stated net of a reserve for write-down of discontinued inventories of $9.7
million, and property held for sale was stated net of a reserve for write-down
of $17.5 million. The balances of deferred tax assets at January 29,
 
                                       18
<PAGE>
 
1994 were significantly higher than those at the end of the previous fiscal
year primarily because most of the restructuring charge was not currently
deductible. The Company has not established a valuation allowance because its
deferred tax assets can be realized by offsetting taxable income mainly in the
carryback period, and also against deferred tax liabilities and future taxable
income, which management believes will more likely than not be earned, based on
the Company's historical earnings record.
 
 Under a bank credit agreement dated July 8, 1993 and amended November 15,
1993, the Company may borrow up to $80 million from a group of banks through
January 28, 1995, with any borrowings to be repaid by January 28, 1995. The
Company does not have any compensating balance requirements under this
agreement, but is required to pay a fee of one-half percent per annum of the
total commitment. Interest on borrowings is payable, at the Company's option,
either at (a) the Eurodollar rate plus one percent, or (b) the lending banks'
average prime rate. The agreement also contains covenants which, among other
things, include minimum fixed charge coverage and net worth requirements and
limit the payment of cash dividends on common stock in any fiscal year to not
more than 25% of the Company's consolidated net income for the immediately
preceding fiscal year.
 
 On March 15, 1994, the Company filed a registration statement for the proposed
sale of $100 million of senior subordinated notes. The proceeds of any offering
of such notes will be used to fund the opening of new stores, including
acquisition of real estate and the construction of stores; to make scheduled
principal repayments on senior debt, including a $12 million principal payment
due in May 1994 on the Company's 9.58% senior notes; to repay short-term
borrowings (subject to reborrowing) under the Company's bank credit agreement
(under which $20 million was outstanding at February 26, 1994); and for general
corporate purposes. Assuming the successful closing of this debt offering, the
Company expects to renegotiate the terms and expiration date of its bank credit
facility.
 
 As of January 29, 1994, the Company had $19.9 million of cash and cash
equivalents. In addition to its $80 million bank credit agreement, the Company
maintained unsecured lines of credit to provide up to $15 million of short-term
borrowings with interest payable at a rate no greater than prime. There were no
borrowings outstanding under either the Company's bank credit agreement or its
unsecured lines of credit at January 29, 1994.
 
 The Company expects that the proceeds of the planned senior subordinated debt
offering, together with anticipated cash flow from operations, proceeds from
the disposition of inventory and stores, borrowings available under its current
bank credit facility and borrowings expected to be available under a successor
bank credit facility that the Company plans to negotiate after the completion
of the offering, will be sufficient to finance its operations through fiscal
1996. However, the Company may from time to time seek to obtain additional
financing. The Company's cash requirements may vary, based on its success in
disposing of the HomeBase stores planned for closing.
 
SEASONALITY
 
 BJ's sales and profits have typically been strongest in the Christmas holiday
season, while HomeBase's sales and profits have been strongest in the spring
building season.

SUMMARY OF ACCOUNTING POLICIES
 
Basis of Presentation
 
 The consolidated financial statements of Waban Inc. (the "Company") include
the financial statements of all of the Company's subsidiaries, all of which are
wholly-owned.
 
Fiscal Year
 
 The Company's fiscal year ends on the last Saturday in January. The fiscal
years ended January 29, 1994 and January 25, 1992 each included 52 weeks. The
fiscal year ended January 30, 1993 included 53 weeks.
 
Cash Equivalents and Marketable Securities
 
 The Company considers highly liquid investments with a maturity of three
months or less at time of purchase to be cash equivalents. Investments with
maturities exceeding three months are classified as marketable securities. At
January 30, 1993, marketable securities consisted of $10,111,000 of
collateralized mortgage obligations, which were collateralized by U.S.
government agency securities, and $6,761,000 of municipal securities. These
investments were stated at the lower of amortized cost or market value.
 
Merchandise Inventories
 
 Inventories are stated primarily at the lower of cost, determined under the
average cost method, or market. The Company recognizes the write-down of slow-
moving or obsolete inventory in cost of sales when such write-downs are
probable and estimable. At January 29, 1994, merchandise inventories are stated
net of a reserve of $9,653,000, which was established in connection with the
Company's restructuring.
 
Property and Equipment
 
 Buildings, furniture, fixtures and equipment are depreciated by use of the
straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets. Leasehold
costs and improvements are amortized by use of the straight-line method over
the lease term or their estimated useful life, whichever is shorter.
 
Preopening Costs
 
 Preopening costs consist of direct incremental costs of opening a facility and
are charged to operations within the fiscal year that a new warehouse opens.
 
Membership Fees
 
 Membership fees are included in revenue when received, but not before a
warehouse opens.
 
Interest on Debt and Capital Leases
 
 Interest on debt and capital leases in the Statement of Income is presented
net of interest income and investment income of $1,507,000 in fiscal 1994,
$4,743,000 in fiscal 1993 and $3,886,000 in fiscal 1992.
 
Capitalized Interest
 
 The Company capitalizes interest related to the development of owned
facilities. Interest in the amount of $2,773,000, $2,441,000 and $521,000 was
capitalized in fiscal 1994, 1993 and 1992, respectively.
 
Net Income Per Common Share
 
 Primary and fully diluted net income per common share are based on the
weighted average number of common and common equivalent shares and other
dilutive securities outstanding in each year.

A.CUMULATIVE EFFECT OF ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLE CHANGES
 
  Effective January 31, 1993 (the first day of fiscal 1994), the Company
  adopted Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 109,
  "Accounting for Income Taxes," SFAS No. 106, "Employers' Accounting for
  Postretirement Benefits Other Than Pensions," and SFAS No. 112, "Employers'
  Accounting for Postemployment Benefits." The cumulative effect of these
  accounting principle changes increased (decreased) after-tax income by the
  following amounts (in thousands):

  SFAS No. 109, "Accounting for Income Taxes"                        $1,616

   Other Than Pensions," net of tax benefit of $138                    (210)
  SFAS No. 112, "Employers' Accounting for Postemployment Benefits,"

                                                                     ======

B.RESTRUCTURING CHARGE
 
  In the fourth quarter of the fiscal year ended January 29, 1994 the Company
  recorded a pre-tax restructuring charge of $101.1 million ($60.2 million
  post-tax) primarily related to repositioning its HomeBase division, which
  includes:
 
   1) closing or relocating 16 HomeBase warehouses which have limited
      potential for long-term profitability. This group of warehouses
      consists mostly of older units which do not have desirable locations
      or are not suitable for the current HomeBase prototype;
   2) closing all eight HomeBase warehouses in the midwestern markets of
      Chicago and Toledo;
   3) liquidating discontinued merchandise; and
   4) related administrative expenses.
 
  The main components of the restructuring charge in fiscal 1994 are:
 
   1) Operating losses and store closing costs (excluding employee
      termination costs) are estimated to be approximately $31.3 million.
      This charge comprises the actual losses and costs of the eight
      midwestern HomeBase warehouse stores from the beginning of November
      1993 through their closing at the end of January 1994, and the
      estimated losses and costs of 16 other warehouse stores from
      the beginning of December 1993 through their anticipated closings in
      the fiscal year ending in January 1995.
   2) Employee termination costs are estimated to be approximately $3.6
      million, including severance pay and postemployment medical expenses.
   3) The net book value of HomeBase property to be disposed of was written
      down by approximately $17.4 million. This charge represents the
      difference between the net book value of owned real estate, leasehold
      improvements and furniture, fixtures and equipment to be disposed of
      and the estimated proceeds to be realized from their sale.
   4) Contract termination costs are estimated to be approximately $36.9
      million. This charge primarily represents HomeBase's obligations for
      leased properties after their closing date offset by estimated
      sublease income expected to be realized, net of expenses.
   5) The write-down to net realizable value of inventory being discontinued
      because it is not related to HomeBase's core home improvement
      merchandise is estimated to be approximately $9.8 million.
 
  At January 29, 1994, merchandise inventories are stated net of a reserve
  for write-down of discontinued inventories of $9,653,000, and property held
  for sale was stated net of a reserve for write-down of $17,479,000.

  As of January 29, 1994, real estate financings were collateralized by land
  and buildings with a net book value of $23,740,000.
 
  The Company's 9.58% unsecured senior notes are payable in five annual
  installments of $12 million beginning May 31, 1994. In July 1992, the
  Company issued $108.6 million of 6.5% convertible subordinated debentures
  due 2002. The debentures are convertible into the Company's common stock at
  a conversion price of $24.75 per share.
 
  Under a bank credit agreement dated July 8, 1993 and amended November 15,
  1993, the Company may borrow up to $80 million from a group of banks
  through January 28, 1995, with any borrowings to be repaid by January 28,
  1995. The Company does not have any compensating balance requirements under
  this agreement, but is required to pay a fee of one-half percent per annum
  of the total commitment. Interest on borrowings is payable, at the
  Company's option, either at (a) the Eurodollar rate plus one percent, or
  (b) the lending banks' average prime rate.
 
  The senior note and bank credit agreements contain covenants which, among
  other things, include minimum working capital, net worth and fixed charge
  coverage requirements and limit the payment of cash dividends on common
  stock. Under the most restrictive requirements, cash dividends in any
  fiscal year are limited to not more than 25% of the Company's consolidated
  net income for the immediately preceding fiscal year, and cumulative cash
  dividends are limited to not more than $10 million plus 50% of adjusted net
  income after January 26, 1991 and 50% of the cash proceeds from common
  stock sales after July 1, 1991, reduced by any investments deemed to be
  restricted.

  The Company has unsecured lines of credit that provide up to $15 million of
  short-term borrowings with interest payable at a rate no greater than
  prime. There were no borrowings outstanding under either the Company's bank
  credit agreement or its unsecured lines of credit at January 29, 1994. In
  addition, the Company has letter of credit facilities of approximately
  $36.4 million primarily to support the purchase of inventories, of which
  approximately $12.6 million were outstanding at January 29, 1994. The
  Company does not have any compensating balance requirements nor does it pay
  commitment fees under this arrangement.
 
D.COMMITMENTS

  Rental expense under operating leases (including contingent rentals which
  were not material) amounted to $90,699,000, $81,006,000 and $67,345,000 for
  the fiscal years ended January 29, 1994, January 30, 1993 and January 25,
  1992, respectively.
 
  As of January 29, 1994, the Company is contingently liable on three
  warehouse store leases that were assigned to a third party in connection
  with HomeBase's restructuring. The Company believes that this contingent
  liability will not have a material effect on the Company's financial
  condition.
 
E.CAPITAL STOCK, STOCK OPTIONS AND STOCK PURCHASE PLANS
 
  Under its Stock Incentive Plan, the Company has granted certain key
  employees options which expire five to ten years from the grant date to
  purchase common stock at prices equal to 100% of market price on the grant
  date. Options outstanding are exercisable over various periods generally
  starting one year after the grant date. At January 29, 1994, 472,139 shares
  were exercisable under the Stock Incentive Plan.

  The Company has also issued, at no cost, restricted stock awards to certain
  key employees under its Stock Incentive Plan. The restrictions on the
  transferability of shares tied to Company performance lapse over periods
  that range up to eight years; for other awards, restrictions on the sale of
  shares lapse over periods that range up to four years. The market price of
  restricted stock issued is charged to income ratably over the period during
  which the restrictions lapse. In fiscal 1994, 1993 and 1992 the Company
  issued 237,250, 160,250 and 93,500 restricted shares, respectively;
  229,145, 2,125 and 9,250 restricted shares were returned to the Company and
  cancelled in fiscal 1994, 1993 and 1992, respectively.
 
  As of January 29, 1994 and January 30, 1993, respectively, 1,450,010 and
  1,423,900 shares were reserved for future stock awards under the Company's
  Stock Incentive Plan.
 
  In 1989 the Company adopted a shareholder rights plan designed to
  discourage attempts to acquire the Company on terms not approved by the
  Board of Directors. Under the plan, shareholders were issued one Right for
  each share of common stock owned, which entitles them to purchase 1/100
  share of Series A Junior Participating Preferred Stock ("Series A Preferred
  Stock") at an exercise price of $75. The Company has designated 1,900,000
  shares of Series A Preferred Stock for use under the rights plan; none has
  been issued. Generally the terms of the Series A Preferred Stock are
  designed so that each 1/100 share of Series A Preferred Stock is the
  economic equivalent of one share of the Company's common stock. In the
  event any person acquires 15% or more of the Company's outstanding stock,
  the Rights become exercisable for the number of common shares which, at the
  time, would have a market value of two times the exercise price of the
  Right.
 
  The Company has authorized 10,000,000 shares of preferred stock, $.01 par
  value, of which no shares have been issued.
 
F.INCOME TAXES
 
  Effective January 31, 1993 (the first day of fiscal 1994), the Company
  adopted SFAS No. 109, "Accounting for Income Taxes." SFAS No. 109 changes
  the Company's method of accounting for income taxes from the income
  statement approach prescribed by Accounting Principles Board Opinion No. 11
  to an assets and liabilities approach. The cumulative effect of this
  accounting change was to increase net income by $1,616,000 in the fiscal
  year ended January 29, 1994 (See Note A). As permitted by SFAS No. 109,
  prior years' financial statements were not restated.

  During the Company's third quarter of fiscal 1994, the statutory federal
  income tax rate for corporations was raised from 34% to 35%, retroactive to
  January 1, 1993, and the Targeted Jobs Tax Credit was restored retroactive
  to July 1, 1992. The net effect of the tax law changes on the Company's
  provision (benefit) for income taxes, which was recorded in the third
  quarter of fiscal 1994, was not material.

  The Company has not established a valuation allowance because its deferred
  tax assets can be realized by offsetting taxable income mainly in the
  carryback period, and also against deferred tax liabilities and future
  taxable income, which management believes will more likely than not be
  earned, based on the Company's historical earnings record.

  For fiscal 1993 and 1992, the deferred income tax provisions, computed in
  accordance with Accounting Principles Board Opinion No. 11, represent the
  effects of timing differences between financial and income tax reporting.

  During the fiscal year ended January 25, 1992, the Company utilized $6.4
  million of net operating loss carryforwards and $.4 million of investment
  tax credit carryforwards related to a prior acquisition. The Company
  recognized the utilization of these carryforwards by reducing the recorded
  value of the acquired fixed assets by $.9 million and by recording deferred
  credits of $1.7 million in fiscal 1992, which are included in other
  noncurrent liabilities on the balance sheet. Income tax expense was not
  affected. The deferred credits are being amortized over the estimated
  useful lives of the acquired assets.
 
G.PENSIONS
 
  The Company has a non-contributory defined benefit retirement plan covering
  full-time employees who have attained twenty-one years of age and have
  completed one year of service. Benefits are based on compensation earned in
  each year of service. During fiscal 1993, the Board of Directors voted that
  no benefits would accrue under this plan after July 4, 1992. No gain or
  loss resulted from the curtailment of this plan. In December 1993, the
  Company terminated its unfunded plan which provided additional retirement
  benefits for certain key employees. The net income effect of the
  termination and settlement of this plan was not material. The Company also
  has a non-contributory retirement plan covering directors who are not
  employees or officers of the Company.
 
  Net periodic pension cost under the Company's plans, presented in
  accordance with SFAS No. 87, includes the following components (in

  The weighted average discount rates used in determining the actuarial
  present value of the projected benefit obligation were 7.5% in fiscal 1994
  and 8.5% in fiscal 1993. The assumed rate of increase in future
  compensation levels used in fiscal 1993 was 5.5%. This assumption is not
  applicable in fiscal 1994 because no benefits accrue under the Company's
  retirement plan after July 4, 1992. The expected long-term rate of return
  on assets was 9.5% in both years. The Company's funding policy is to
  contribute annually an amount allowable for federal income tax purposes.
  Pension plan assets consist primarily of equity and fixed income
  securities.
 
  Effective on July 4, 1992, the Company's 401(k) Savings Plan was amended so
  that non-highly compensated employees may make pre-tax contributions up to
  15% of covered compensation, as allowed under Section 401(k) of the
  Internal Revenue Code. The Company matches employee contributions at 100%
  of the first one percent of covered compensation and 50% of the next four
  percent, payable at the end of the year. Before the amendment became
  effective, eligible employees could make pre-tax contributions up to 10% of
  covered compensation, and the Company matched contributions of the first
  five percent of covered compensation at rates ranging from 25% to 50%. The
  Company's expense under this plan was $3,277,000 in fiscal 1994, $2,216,000
  in fiscal 1993 and $838,000 in fiscal 1992.
 
H.POSTRETIREMENT MEDICAL BENEFITS
 
  The Company sponsors a defined benefit postretirement medical plan that
  covers employees and their spouses who retire after age 55 with at least 10
  years of service, who are not eligible for Medicare, and who participated
  in a Company-sponsored medical plan. Amounts contributed by retired
  employees under this plan are based on years of service prior to
  retirement. The plan is not funded.
 
  SFAS No. 106, "Employers' Accounting for Postretirement Benefits Other Than
  Pensions," requires employers to recognize postretirement benefits over the
  periods during which employees render services rather than at the time
  benefits are paid. SFAS No. 106 was implemented by the Company by
  recognizing the transition obligation of $348,000 in the first quarter of
  fiscal 1994.

  For measurement purposes as of January 31, 1993, an annual rate of increase
  in the per capita cost of medical coverage of 12% in fiscal 1994 grading
  down to 5% after 20 years was assumed. For measurement purposes as of
  January 29, 1994, an annual rate of increase in the per capita cost of
  medical coverage of 10% in fiscal 1995 grading down to 5% after 10 years
  was assumed. Increasing the assumed health care cost trend rate one
  percentage point would increase the aggregate of the service and interest
  cost components of net periodic postretirement benefit cost for fiscal 1994
  by $27,000 and would increase the accumulated postretirement benefit
  obligation as of January 29, 1994 by $87,000.
 
  The weighted average discount rate used in determining the accumulated
  postretirement benefit obligation was 8.5% as of January 31, 1993 and 7.5%
  as of January 29, 1994.

K.DISCLOSURES ABOUT FAIR VALUE OF FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS
 
  The following methods and assumptions were used to estimate the fair value
  of each class of financial instruments for which it is practicable to
  estimate that value:
 
  Cash and Cash Equivalents
 
  The carrying amount approximates fair value because of the short maturity
  of these instruments.
 
  Marketable Securities
 
  The fair value of the Company's marketable securities is based on quoted
  values provided by dealers of these securities.
 
  Real Estate Financings and General Corporate Debt
 
  The fair value of the Company's real estate financings and general
  corporate debt is estimated based on the current rates for similar issues
  or on the current rates offered to the Company for debt of the same
  remaining maturities.

M.RELATIONSHIP WITH THE TJX COMPANIES, INC. ("TJX")
 
  The Company was formed in 1989, when Zayre Corp. (now TJX), as part of its
  restructuring, combined its BJ's Wholesale Club and HomeBase divisions to
  form Waban Inc. In connection with the spin-off from TJX (the "Spin-Off"),
  the Company and TJX entered into a Distribution Agreement and a Services
  Agreement.
 
  The Distribution Agreement provides for, among other things, (i) the
  division between the Company and TJX of certain liabilities and (ii)
  certain other agreements governing the relationship between the Company and
  TJX following the Spin-Off. Under the Distribution Agreement, TJX assumed
  certain liabilities relating to the Company's business for the period prior
  to the Spin-Off. In general, the Company assumed responsibility for all
  post-Spin-Off liabilities relating to its business. TJX retained liability
  for insured claims arising before the Spin-Off and in 1999 will receive
  from (or pay to) the Company the amount by which TJX's costs at the end of
  this 10-year period exceed (or are less than) the reserve amount agreed to.
 
  Pursuant to the Services Agreement, TJX provided certain services,
  primarily data processing, for which the Company paid TJX $6,483,000,
  $5,547,000 and $5,241,000 in fiscal 1994, 1993 and 1992, respectively. The
  Company has elected to continue to purchase data processing and certain
  other services through fiscal 1995.

                       REPORT OF INDEPENDENT ACCOUNTANTS
 
TO THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS OF WABAN INC.:
 
We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Waban Inc. and
subsidiaries as of January 29, 1994 and January 30, 1993, and the related
consolidated statements of income, shareholders' equity, and cash flows for
each of the three fiscal years in the period ended January 29, 1994. These
financial statements are the responsibility of the Company's management. Our
responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements based on
our audits.
 
We conducted our audits in accordance with generally accepted auditing
standards. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of
material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence
supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. An audit
also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant
estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial
statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis
for our opinion.
 
In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present fairly, in
all material respects, the consolidated financial position of Waban Inc. and
subsidiaries as of January 29, 1994 and January 30, 1993 and the consolidated
results of their operations and their cash flows for each of the three fiscal
years in the period ended January 29, 1994 in conformity with generally
accepted accounting principles.
 
As discussed in Notes A, F and H to the Consolidated Financial Statements, the
Company changed its methods of accounting for postretirement benefits other
than pensions, for postemployment benefits and for income taxes in fiscal 1994.

                              REPORT OF MANAGEMENT
 
The financial statements and related financial information in this annual
report have been prepared by and are the responsibility of management. The
financial statements were prepared in accordance with generally accepted
accounting principles and necessarily include amounts which are based upon
judgments and estimates made by management.
 
The Company maintains a system of internal controls designed to provide, at
appropriate cost, reasonable assurance that assets are safeguarded,
transactions are executed in accordance with management's authorization and the
accounting records may be relied upon for the preparation of financial
statements. The accounting and control systems are continually reviewed by
management and modified as necessary in response to changing business
conditions and the recommendations of the Company's internal auditors and
independent public accountants.
 
The Audit Committee, which is comprised of members of the Board of Directors
who are neither officers nor employees, meets periodically with management, the
internal auditors and the independent public accountants to review matters
relating to the Company's financial reporting, the adequacy of internal
accounting controls and the scope and results of audit work. The internal
auditors and the independent public accountants have free access to the
Committee.
 
The financial statements have been audited by Coopers & Lybrand, whose opinion
as to their fair presentation in accordance with generally accepted accounting
principles appears above.

group of management-level employees.  The list of Participants is attached as
"Schedule A" hereto, which list shall be periodically updated.  The Committee,
in its sole and absolute discretion, may designate new Participants and remove
persons as Participants hereunder, provided that the Committee may not take any
                                   -------- ----

     ARTICLE 2.  BENEFITS UNDER THIS PLAN
                 ------------------------

     2.1  Annual Retirement Contribution.  The Committee shall determine, in 
          ------------------------------
its sole discretion, at any time within two (2) months prior to the end of
the Plan Year but no later than two and one-half (2-1/2) months following the
close of the Plan Year, the amount of the Annual Retirement Contribution the
Company will make on behalf of each Participant, which amount shall be
distributed or deemed distributed (as the case may be) as soon as practicable
after the Committee's determination.

     A Participant hereunder shall be entitled to an Annual Retirement
Contribution in a Plan Year only if the Participant was actively employed by the
Company on the last day of such Plan Year, unless the Participant's termination
                                           ------                              
of employment during the Plan Year occurred due to either the Participant's (i)
retirement on or after the attainment of age fifty-five (55), or (ii) disability
(as defined under the Company's long-term disability plan).

     2.2  Amount of Annual Retirement Contribution.  The Committee shall have 
          ----------------------------------------  
sole and absolute discretion to determine the amount of the Annual Retirement
Contribution; provided that the smallest Annual Retirement Contribution the
              -------- ----   
Committee may determine on behalf of each Participant shall be that amount
sufficient to provide the Participant with a benefit equal to three percent
(3%) of the Participant's Compensation on 

                                      2
<PAGE>
 
an "after-tax" basis, taking into account the Participant's appropriate
marginal tax bracket. The "after-tax" value of the Annual Retirement
Contribution is hereinafter referred to as the "After-Tax Benefit".

     2.3  Investment of After-Tax Benefit.  As a condition of being a     
          -------------------------------                            
Participant hereunder, each Participant agrees, understands and accepts that the
After-Tax Benefit will be used to fund an appropriate vehicle to provide
retirement income and benefit to the Participant (such as an insurance policy),
which such vehicle shall be chosen by the Committee.  If the Committee chooses
an insurance program as said appropriate vehicle, then in the Committee's sole
discretion either: (i) the Participant shall apply the After-Tax Benefit to
purchase and maintain an individual policy (with the Participant as the owner
thereof), or (ii) the Committee shall, on behalf of the Participant, apply the
After-Tax Benefit to purchase and maintain an individual account (with the
Participant as the owner thereof) under a group policy.

     The Committee reserves the right not to make Annual Retirement 
Contributions on behalf of a Participant if it becomes aware or determines that
prior Annual Retirement Contributions are not being applied in accordance with
the terms and intent of this paragraph 2.3.


     ARTICLE 3.  FUNDING
                 -------

     3.1  Four Year Rule.  Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein 
          --------------                                                  
contained or implied, including Section 2.1 hereof, the Company will make
payment in respect of a Participant's Annual Retirement Contribution for a Plan
Year only if the Participant has been credited with at least four (4) Years of
Service by the end of such Plan Year.

     3.2  Treatment of Participants With Less Than Four Years of Service.  If a
          --------------------------------------------------------------       
Participant hereunder is credited with less than four (4) Years of Service by
the end of the applicable Plan Year, the Participant will accrue the right to an
Annual Retirement Contribution for that Plan Year, based on (i) the Annual
Retirement Contribution approved by the Committee for that Plan Year, and (ii)
the Participant's Compensation for that Plan Year.

     In the Plan Year in which the Participant is first credited with four (4)
Years of Service, the Company will, in the time-frame determined in accordance
with Section 2.1 hereof, make an aggregate retirement contribution on behalf of
the Participant equal to:  (i) the amount of the Annual Retirement Contribution
for such Plan Year, plus (ii) the Annual Retirement Contribution amounts the
Participant had accrued in the prior three (3) Plan Years, as determined
pursuant to the first sentence of this Section 3.2.  The aggregate retirement
contribution shall be treated as provided in Section 2.3 hereof.

                                      3

     3.3  Forfeitures.  If a Participant hereunder terminates employment with
          -----------                                                        
the Company prior to being credited with four (4) Years of Service, the
Participant shall forfeit the right to any benefit accrued hereunder.


     ARTICLE 4.  EFFECT ON EMPLOYMENT RIGHTS.  This Plan shall not constitute an
                 ---------------------------                                    
employment contract and nothing contained in this Plan shall confer upon the
Participant the right to be retained in the service of the Company nor limit the
right of the Company to discharge or otherwise deal with the Participant without
regard to the existence of this Plan.


     ARTICLE 5.  ADMINISTRATION.
                 --------------

Committee shall have full power, discretion and authority to interpret, construe
and administer the Plan and any part thereof.

     Subject to the limitations of this Plan, the Committee from time to time
may establish rules for the administration and interpretation of the Plan and

disputed question shall be conclusive.

any officer of the Company to execute or deliver any instrument, make any
payment or perform any other act which the Plan authorizes or requires the
Committee to do.

     The Committee may employ counsel and other agents and may procure such
clerical, accounting, actuarial, consulting and other services as it may require
in carrying out the provisions of the Plan.

     5.2  Indemnification.  The Company shall indemnify and save harmless each
          ---------------                                                     
member of the Committee against all expenses and liabilities arising out of
membership on such Committee, excepting only expenses and liabilities arising
from such member's own gross negligence or willful misconduct, as determined by
the Board of Directors or outside counsel designated by the Board of Directors.


     ARTICLE 6.  AMENDMENT OR TERMINATION OF PLAN.  The Plan may be amended,
                 --------------------------------                           
suspended or terminated in whole or in part at any time and from time to time by
the Committee.  No such amendment, suspension or termination shall retroactively
impair or otherwise adversely affect the rights of any Participant to benefits
under this Plan that have been funded prior to the date of such amendment,
suspension or termination.

     2.1  Granting of Awards.
          -----------------  



          (a)  The Grant.  On or before the commencement of each Award Period,
               ---------                                                      
the Committee shall determine (i) which employees shall be Participants in the
Plan, (ii) the amount of Incentive Units to be granted to each Participant, and
(iii) the method or formula for determining the value of each Incentive Unit,
based on the Incentive Measurement.

          (b)  Payment Dates.  On or before the commencement of each Award
               -------------                                              
Period, the Committee shall determine (i) the date or dates on or about which
payment in respect of Incentive Units shall be made, and (ii) the amount of each
Participant's Incentive Units which may be redeemed on such payment dates.  One
such payment date shall occur at some time within three (3) months after the end
of the Award Period and other date(s) may occur one (1) or more years after such
date (the "Deferred Payment Date").

     2.2  Value of Incentive Units.  On or before the commencement of each
          ------------------------                                        
Award Period, the Committee shall determine (i) the factor(s) comprising the
Incentive Measurement, and (ii) the Incentive Measurement's base value, i.e.,
                                                                        ---- 
the value against which growth shall be measured.  Notwithstanding the prior
sentence, the Incentive Measurement's base value may be appropriately adjusted
by the Committee, in its discretion, after the certification of the Company's
financial statements by the Company's independent public accountant for the
fiscal year immediately preceding the commencement of the Award Period.  In the
Committee's discretion, Incentive Measurements may vary with respect to
Incentive Unit grants made to individual Participants or groups of Participants.

     2.3  Award Opportunity.  Upon the completion of each Award Period and the 
          -----------------                                               
certification of the Company's financial statements by the Company's
independent public accountant for the last fiscal year in said Award Period,
the Committee shall cause to be re-valued the Incentive Measurement in order
to determine the growth over the Incentive Measurement's base value and, thus,
the value of each Incentive Unit.


                                      2
<PAGE>
 
     Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein contained or implied, the 
Committee may make appropriate adjustments to the value of the Incentive
Measurement to avoid undue windfalls or hardships due to external conditions
outside the control of management, nonrecurring or abnormal items, changes in
accounting practices, or such other matters as the Committee, in its
discretion, shall determine.

     2.4  Payment of Awards.

Period and prior to a Deferred Payment Date, payment with respect to any
outstanding deferred payment amount shall be made as soon as practicable after
such termination.

          (c)  Termination of Employment for any Reason Other than Death,
               ----------------------------------------------------------
Disability or Retirement. In the event of the Participant's termination of
- ------------------------

the right to file with the Committee a written designation of one or more
persons as beneficiary(ies) who shall be entitled to receive the amount, if any,

Committee shall be controlling, provided, however, that no designation or 
                                --------  -------  ----  
modification thereof shall be effective unless received by the Committee prior 
to the Participant's death.

     If no such beneficiary designation is in effect at the time of a
Participant's death, or if no designated beneficiary survives the Participant,
the amount payable under the Plan upon the Participant's death shall be made to
the Participant's surviving spouse; if there is no surviving spouse, payment
shall be made to the Participant's estate.

                                   Agreement
                                   ---------

     Agreement dated as of May 25, 1993 between Waban Inc. (the "Company") and
John F. Levy ("Levy").

                                    Recitals
                                    --------

     The Company and Levy entered into an Employment Agreement dated as of June
1, 1989 (the "Employment Agreement").  Terms defined in the Employment Agreement
are used herein as so defined.

     The Company and Levy have agreed that Levy will resign from his employment
and offices with the Company, subject to the provisions of this Agreement.

                                   Agreement
                                   ---------

     The Company and Levy agree as follows:

     1.  Levy hereby resigns as President and Chief Executive Officer and a
director of the Company and from all other offices and positions with the
Company and each of its subsidiaries, effective as of the date hereof.

     2.  The Employment Period shall terminate as of the date hereof.

     3.  Levy shall be entitled to all compensation and benefits specified in
Section 5(b) of the Employment Agreement in the case of termination pursuant to
clause (ii) of such Section 5(b), except that (x) the Company will pay to Levy
pursuant to Section 5(b)(i) his current Base Salary through May 23, 1995,
without reduction for compensation earned from other employment or self-
employment through May 23, 1994, and thereafter reduced by such compensation
earned from other employment or self-employment and (y) Levy shall be entitled
to the benefits specified in Section 5(b)(ii) until the expiration of the period
of Base Salary payments (except to the extent that Levy shall obtain the same
from another employer or from self-employment).  For purposes of his 1989 PARS
grant, pursuant to the third paragraph of Section 2 of Exhibit A to the
Employment Agreement, Levy shall vest in 4,167 shares as his pro rated PARS
entitlement.

         In addition, Levy shall be deemed vested in his benefits under SERP,
with 19 years and six months Years of Service under SERP, for all purposes of
SERP (including Sections 5.02 and 5.05) other than Section 5.07. SERP benefits
shall become payable at the time and in the manner provided in SERP. Sections
8.02 and 8.03 of SERP shall not apply to Levy. In the event that the Company
shall at any time during or after the Employment Period generally offer to
participants in SERP the

<PAGE>
 
 
right to convert their SERP benefits into a lump sum or third party annuity
payment, or shall generally accelerate payments under SERP for any reason,
including a change of control of the Company, the Company will grant Levy or his
legal representative a comparable right, except that he shall not be entitled to
any tax gross up rights whether or not extended to other SERP participants.  The
Company shall provide Levy notice of any such offer or acceleration within 10
days after the occurrence thereof.

     The Company shall also continue to provide Levy with his car allowance
through May 31, 1994 or until his earlier other employment.  The Company shall
within a reasonable time obtain and provide to Levy at the Company's expense
office space within 20 miles of Waban, Massachusetts and reasonable secretarial
assistance until May 31, 1994 or until his earlier other employment.  Levy shall
have reasonable access to his present office and secretarial assistance for the
purpose of removing his personal files and effects.

     4.  Sections 6(a) and 6(c) of the Employment Agreement shall remain
applicable to Levy in accordance with their terms.  Section 6(b) shall be
superseded by the following agreement of Levy, which shall remain applicable to
Levy through May 31, 1994:

          During the course of his employment, Levy has learned many trade
          secrets of the Company and has had access to confidential information
          and business plans for the Company.  Therefore, Levy will not engage,
          either as a principal, employee, partner, consultant or investor
          (other than a less-than-1% stock interest in a corporation), in any of
          the following businesses:

               Home Depot, Builders Square, Sams, Price Club, Costco and Pace.

          Levy agrees that if, at any time, pursuant to action of any court,
          administrative or governmental body or other arbitral tribunal, the
          operation of any part of this paragraph shall be determined to be
          unlawful or otherwise unenforceable, then the coverage of this
          paragraph shall be deemed to be restricted as to duration,
          geographical scope or otherwise, to the extent, and only to the
          extent, necessary to make this paragraph lawful and enforceable in the
          particular jurisdiction in which such determination is made.

     5.   In consideration of this Agreement and the benefits provided to Levy
hereunder, Levy hereby releases and absolves the Company and its affiliates,
agrees not to sue or commence

                                      -2-

<PAGE>
 
proceedings or initiate or file a complaint against the Company and its
affiliates, the successors and assigns of the Company and its affiliates, and
all officers, directors, stockholders, agents and employees of each (hereinafter
referred to as "Releasees"), of, from and with respect to the following:  (i)
any claims arising out of, based upon or connected with Levy's employment by the
Company, the compensation and working conditions for that employment and/or the
termination of that employment; and (ii) any claim that might exist under
federal, state or local employment discrimination laws, fair employment practice
laws, civil rights or pension statutes or regulations (other than vested pension
rights) pursuant thereto or the common law with respect to that employment or
the termination thereof, including, without limitation, The Age in
Discrimination Employment Act.  There is excepted from the foregoing release and
other undertakings by Levy in this paragraph 5 (i) any payment required to be
made pursuant to this Agreement and (ii) any indemnification rights to which
Levy is presently entitled under Delaware law, the Company's Certificate of
Incorporation, By-laws, Resolution of the Board of Directors of the Company or
indemnification agreement with the Company, all of which rights shall remain in
effect.

     For good and valuable consideration, the receipt of which is hereby
acknowledged by the Company, the Company does hereby release Levy and agrees not
to sue or commence proceedings against Levy, his heirs and assigns, of, from and
with respect to any claim arising out of, based upon or connected with Levy's
employment by the Company.

Employee's employment is terminated by the Company for any reason other than
cause, Employee will be entitled to receive 52 weeks of severance pay.  Such
severance pay, however, is to be reduced, after the first 12 weeks, dollar-for-
dollar for income that Employee earns from other employment (including self-
employment).

          B.  Employee and his wife, Cathryn Patterson ("C. Patterson"),
entered into a Loan Agreement as of July 14, 1993 (the "Loan Agreement"),
setting forth the terms and conditions of a loan from the Company to Employee
and C. Patterson in the principal amount of Three Hundred Fifty Thousand Dollars
($350,000) (the "Loan") to be used for the purchase of a principal residence in
the Southern California area for Employee and C. Patterson ("Employee
Residence").  The Loan Agreement is evidenced by a Promissory Note in the
principal amount of the Loan (the "Note"), which Note is secured by a Deed of
Trust which was recorded on September 13, 1993, as Instrument No. 93-614467 in
the Official Records of Orange County, California (the "Deed of Trust") which
encumbers the Employee Residence.  The Loan Agreement, the Note, the Deed of
Trust and any and all other documents evidencing or securing the Loan are
collectively referred to herein as the "Loan Documents."

          C.  The Loan Agreement provides that if Employee ceases to be
employed by the Company, the Company shall have the right to set off against any
severance payments payable to Employee (i) the outstanding balance of the Loan
together with all accrued interest thereon and all other sums owing to the
Company pursuant to the Loan Documents and (ii) any other amounts advanced by
the Company to facilitate the purchase of the Employee Residence.

          D.  The Company presented Employee with a form of this Agreement
on September 29, 1993, which was subsequently negotiated by the parties and the
results of these negotiations are reflected in the terms and conditions set
forth below.

other laws.

              (b)  In the event the Company is or becomes involved in any
legal action relating to events which occurred while Employee was rendering
services to the Company or about which Employee possesses any information,
Employee agrees to assist in the capacity of a witness in the preparation,

          3.  Severance Pay; Offset.  The Company will provide Employee

Paragraph 27 below in one lump sum, less applicable payroll taxes and
withholdings.  The net amount of such severance pay due Employee equals
$314,500.00 and such amount shall be set off against the outstanding principal

Documents, thereby  causing the entire outstanding principal balance of the
Loan, plus accrued interest and other sums owed pursuant to the Loan Documents
to become immediately due and payable.  Concurrently

relocation expenses under Paragraph 7(vi) below will be appropriately
reflected in Employee's tax forms from the Company. Employee understands that

admission of liability.  The parties hereto have entered into this Agreement in
good faith and with the desire to forever settle between them those matters
described in this Agreement.

sentence or paragraph of this Agreement be declared void or unenforceable, such
portion may be considered independent and severable from the remainder, the
validity of which shall remain unaffected.

          23.  No Waiver.  Failure to insist on compliance with any term,
               ---------                                                 
covenant or condition contained in this Agreement shall not be deemed a waiver
of that term, covenant or condition, nor shall any waiver or relinquishment of
any right or power contained in this Agreement at any one time or more times be
deemed a waiver or relinquishment of any right or power at any other time or
times.

          24.  Representations and Warranties.  Both parties to this

                            DATED AS OF MAY 25, 1993

                    BETWEEN HERBERT J. ZARKIN AND WABAN INC.

                            EMPLOYMENT AGREEMENT


     AGREEMENT dated as of May 25, 1993 between Herbert J. Zarkin of 8 Lands End
Lane, Sudbury, Massachusetts 01776 ("Executive") and Waban Inc., a Delaware
corporation (the "Company"), whose principal office is in Natick, Massachusetts
01760.

                                  RECITALS
                                  --------

     Executive was employed by the Company in various executive management
positions, including most recently Executive Vice President of the Company and
President of the Company's BJ's Wholesale Club Division.

     The Company desires that Executive serve as its President and Chief
Executive Officer and Executive is willing to serve in  such capacity.

     The Company and Executive deem it desirable and appropriate, therefore, to
enter into this Agreement.

                                  AGREEMENT
                                  ---------

     The parties hereto, in consideration of the mutual agreements hereinafter
contained, agree as follows:

     1.  EFFECTIVE DATE; TERM OF AGREEMENT.  This agreement shall become
         ---------------------------------                              
effective as of May 25, 1993 (the "Effective Date").  This Agreement shall
supersede any existing employment agreement including, without limitation, the
Employment Contract dated as of May 16, 1988 between Executive and the Company,
or similar agreement between Executive and the Company and any of its
Subsidiaries.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Amended and Restated Change of
Control Severance Agreement between the Company and Executive dated May 25, 1993
(the "Change of Control Agreement") shall remain in full force and effect.  The
employment shall continue on the terms provided herein until January 25, 1997
and thereafter until terminated by either Executive or the Company, subject to
earlier termination as provided herein (such period of employment hereinafter
called the "Employment Period").

     2.  SCOPE OF EMPLOYMENT.
         ------------------- 

     (a)  Nature of Services.  Executive shall diligently perform the duties and
          ------------------                                                    
assume the responsibilities of President and Chief Executive Officer of the
Company and such additional executive duties and responsibilities as shall from
time to time be assigned to him by the Board or its Chairman.

                                      -2-
<PAGE>
 
     (b)  Extent of Services.  Except for illnesses and vacation periods,
          ------------------                                             
Executive shall devote substantially all his working time and attention and his
best efforts to the performance of his duties and responsibilities under this
Agreement.  However, Executive may (a) make any passive investments where he is
not obligated or required to, and shall not in fact, devote any managerial
efforts, (b) participate in charitable or community activities or in trade or
professional organizations or (c) subject to Board approval (which approval
shall not be unreasonably withheld or withdrawn), hold directorships in public
companies, except only that the Board shall have the right to limit such
services as a director or such participation whenever the Board shall believe
that the time spent on such activities infringes in any material respect upon
the time required by Executive for the performance of his duties under this
Agreement or is otherwise incompatible with those duties.

     3.  COMPENSATION AND BENEFITS.
         ------------------------- 

     (a)  Base Salary.  Executive shall be paid a base salary at  the rate of no
          -----------                                                           
less than $520,000 per year to be reviewed annually by the Committee (the "Base
Salary").  Base Salary shall be payable in such manner and at such times as the
Company shall pay base salary to other executive employees.

     (b)  Existing Performance Accelerated Restricted Stock.  Reference is made
          -------------------------------------------------                    
to grant to the Executive of 12,500 shares of performance accelerated restricted
stock ("PARS") of the Company dated April 7, 1993 and the 12,500 PARS grant
dated April 13, 1992 (collectively, the "Existing PARS") issued under the
Company's 1989 Stock Incentive Plan, as amended (the "Waban 1989 Plan").  The
Existing PARS have been amended and restated, effective June 10, 1993, to
provide for Company, rather than divisional, performance goals by the Company.
Executive's April 7, 1993 PARS grant has been further amended and the 37,500
PARS grant effective June 10, 1993 has been amended to provide for accelerated
vesting based on revised corporate goals for fiscal 1995 and 1996.  The
Executive's other existing PARS grants dated June 23, 1989 and April 11, 1991
shall remain in effect without modification or amendment.

     (c)  Intentionally omitted.

     (d)  Existing MIP Awards.  Executive and the Company agree that Executive's
          -------------------                                                   
existing award under the Company's Management Incentive Plan ("MIP") for fiscal
1994 (the "Existing MIP Award") shall be replaced by a new award as provided in
paragraph (e) below.

     (e)  New MIP Awards.  Executive shall be eligible to receive awards under
          --------------                                                      
MIP applicable to Executive.  The goals, scope and conditions of any award shall
be established annually by mutual

                                      -3-
<PAGE>
 
agreement between Executive and the Committee.  In each fiscal year, Executive
shall be entitled to earn up to a specified percentage of his Base Salary as a
Target, or Maximum Award, as the case may be.  For each fiscal year of the
Company commencing in fiscal year 1994, the Target Award shall equal 50% of
Executive's Base Salary, and the Maximum Award shall equal 80% of the
Executive's Base Salary, with the payment potential scaling from 0% to 80% of
Executive's Base Salary as established by the terms of the Award; provided,
                                                                  -------- 
however, that in no event shall Executive's award under MIP for fiscal year 1994
- -------                                                                         
under the above formula be less than the award Executive would have received had
Executive retained his Existing MIP Award, as adjusted to give effect to
Executive's Base Salary for fiscal 1994 as set forth in Section 3(a) of this
Agreement.

     (f)  New Company Options.  The Committee has granted Executive non-
          -------------------                                          
statutory options under the Waban 1989 Plan (the "New Options"), for 75,000
shares of Stock, effective June 10, 1993.

     (g)  Qualified Plans.  Executive shall be entitled during the Employment
          ---------------                                                    
Period to participate in the Company's tax-qualified retirement and profit-
sharing plans, if any, in accordance with the terms of those plans.

     (h)  Policies and Fringe Benefits.  Executive shall be subject to Company
          ----------------------------                                        
policies applicable to its executives generally and Executive shall be entitled
to receive all such fringe benefits as the Company shall from time to time make
available to other executives generally (subject to the terms of any applicable
fringe benefits plan).

     4.  TERMINATION OF EMPLOYMENT; IN GENERAL.
         ------------------------------------- 

     (a)  The Company shall have the right to end Executive's employment at any
time and for any reason, with or without Cause.

     (b)  The Employment Period shall terminate when Executive becomes Disabled.
In addition, if by reason of Incapacity Executive is unable to perform his
duties for at least six continuous months, upon written notice by the Company to
Executive the Employment Period will be terminated for Incapacity.

     (c)  Whenever the Employment Period shall terminate, Executive shall resign
all offices or other positions he shall hold with the Company and any affiliated
corporations, including any position on the Board.

                                      -4-
<PAGE>
 
     5.  BENEFITS UPON TERMINATION OF EMPLOYMENT.
         --------------------------------------- 

     (a)  Certain Terminations Prior to January 25, 1997.  If the Employment
          ----------------------------------------------                    
Period shall have terminated prior to January 25, 1997 (i) by reason of death,
Disability or Incapacity of Executive, (ii) by termination by the Company for
any reason other than Cause or (iii) by termination by Executive in the event
that either (A) Executive shall be removed from or fail to be reelected to the
offices of President, Chief Executive Officer, a Director and a member of the
Executive Committee of the Board (other than in connection with termination of
Executive's employment for Cause or by Executive's voluntary termination for
reasons not specified in this clause (iii) or (B) Executive is relocated more
than 40 miles from the current corporate headquarters of the Company, in either
case without his prior written consent (a "Specified Voluntary Termination",
which termination shall not constitute a voluntary termination for any purpose
of this Agreement), then all compensation and benefits for Executive shall be as
follows:

          (i)  For the longer of 24 months after such termination or until
     January 25, 1997, the Company will continue to pay to Executive Base Salary
     at the rate in  effect at termination of employment.  Base Salary shall be
     paid for the first twelve months of the period without reduction for
     compensation earned from other employment or self-employment, and shall
     thereafter be reduced by such compensation earned from other employment or
     self-employment.

          (ii)  Until the expiration of the period of Base Salary payments
     described in (i) above, except to the extent that Executive shall obtain
     the same from another employer or from self-employment, the Company will
     provide such medical and hospital insurance, and term life insurance for
     Executive and his family, comparable to the insurance provided for
     executives generally, as the Company shall determine, and upon the same
     terms and conditions as the same shall be provided for other Company
     executives generally; provided, however, that in no event shall such
                           --------  -------                             
     benefits or the terms and conditions thereof be less favorable to Executive
     than those afforded to him as of the date of termination.

          (iii)  The Company will pay to Executive, without offset for
     compensation earned from other employment or self-employment, the following
     amounts under the Company's MIP applicable to Executive:

     .    First, if not already paid, any amounts to which Executive is entitled
          under MIP for the fiscal year of the Company ended immediately prior
          to Executive's

                                      -5-
<PAGE>
 
          termination of employment.  These amounts will be paid at the same
          time as other awards for such prior year are paid.

     .    Second, an amount equal to Executive's MIP Target Award for the year
          of termination.  This amount will be paid at the same time as other
          MIP awards for the year of termination are paid.

     In addition, the Company will pay to Executive such amounts as Executive
     shall have deferred (but not received) under the Company's General Deferred
     Compensation Plan in accordance with the provisions of that Plan.

          (iv)  Executive shall also be entitled to the benefits with respect to
     any PARS and Stock Options of Executive held on the date of termination as
     provided under the Waban 1989 Plan.  In addition, Executive shall be
     entitled to benefits under other Company plans, to the extent, if any,
     therein provided in the circumstances.

          (v)  If termination occurs by reason of Incapacity or Disability,
     Executive shall be entitled to such compensation, if any, as is payable
     pursuant to the Company's long-term disability plan or any successor
     Company disability plan.  Any payments made to Executive under any long
     term disability plan of the Company with respect to the salary continuation
     period in clause (i) above shall be offset against such salary continuation
     payments and to the extent not so offset, Executive shall promptly make
     reimbursement payments to the Company of such disability payments.

     (b)  Certain Terminations on or after January 25, 1997.  If the Employment
          -------------------------------------------------                    
Period shall have terminated on or after January 25, 1997, (i) by reason of
Death, Disability or Incapacity of Executive or (ii) by termination by the
Company for any reason other than Cause or (iii) by termination by Executive in
respect of a Specified Voluntary Termination, then all compensation and benefits
for Executive shall be as follows:

          (i)  The Company will pay to Executive his then Base Salary for a
     period of twelve months from the Date of Termination, which Base Salary
     shall be reduced after six months for compensation earned from other
     employment or self employment.

          (ii)  Until the expiration of the Period of Base Salary payments
     described in (i) immediately above, except to the extent that Executive
     shall obtain the same from another employer or from self-employment, the
     Company will provide such medical and hospital insurance, and term life
     insurance

                                      -6-
<PAGE>
 
     for Executive and his family, comparable to the insurance provided for
     executives generally, as the Company shall determine, and upon the same
     terms and conditions as the same shall be provided for executives
     generally;  provided, however, that in no event shall such benefits or the
                ---------  -------                                             
     terms and conditions thereof be less favorable to Executive then those
     afforded to him as of the date of termination.

          (iii)  The Company will pay to Executive, without offset for
     compensation earned from other employment or self-employment, the following
     amounts under the Company's MIP applicable to Executive:

     .    First, if not already paid, any amounts to which Executive is entitled
          under MIP for the fiscal year of the Company ended immediately prior
          to Executive's termination of employment.  These amounts will be paid
          at the same time as other awards for such prior year are paid.

     .    Second, an amount equal to Executive's MIP Target Award for the year
          of termination.  This amount will be paid at the same time as other
          MIP awards for the year of termination are paid.

     In addition, the Company will pay to Executive such amounts  as Executive
     shall have deferred (but not received) under the Company's General Deferred
     Compensation Plan in accordance with the provisions of that Plan.

          (iv)  Executive shall also be entitled to the benefits with respect to
     any PARS and Stock Options of Executive held on the date of termination as
     provided under the Waban 1989 Plan.  In addition, Executive shall be
     entitled to the benefits under other Company plans to the extent, if any,
     therein provided in the circumstances.

          (v)  If termination occurs by reason of Incapacity or Disability,
     Executive shall be entitled to such compensation, if any, as is payable
     pursuant to the Company's long-term disability plan or any successor
     Company disability plan.  Any payments made to Executive under any long
     term disability plan of the Company with respect to the salary continuation
     period in clause (i) above shall be offset against such salary continuation
     payments and to the extent not so offset, Executive shall promptly make
     reimbursement payments to the Company of such disability payments.

     (c)  Certain Voluntary Terminations; Termination for Cause; Violation of
          -------------------------------------------------------------------
Certain Agreements.  If, prior to, on, or after January 25, 1997 Executive
- ------------------                                                        
should end his employment voluntarily

                                      -7-
<PAGE>
 
or if the Company should end Executive's employment for Cause, or,
notwithstanding (a) or (b) above, if Executive should violate the protected
persons or noncompetition provisions of Section 6 to the extent then applicable,
all compensation and benefits otherwise payable pursuant to this Agreement shall
cease, other than (x) such amounts as Executive shall have deferred (but not
received) under the Company's General Deferred Compensation Plan in accordance
with the provisions of that Plan, (y) any benefits to which Executive may be
entitled with respect to any PARS and Stock Options held on such date, in each
case, as provided under the Waban 1989 Plan and (z) any benefits to which
Executive may be entitled under other Company plans to the extent, if any,
therein provided in the circumstances.  The Company does not waive any rights it
may have for damages or for injunctive relief.

     (d)  Benefits Upon Change of Control.  Following a Change of Control (as
          -------------------------------                                    
defined in the Change of Control Agreement), any rights of Executive under this
Agreement or any other agreement or plan with respect to uncompleted MIP periods
shall be governed solely by the Change of Control Agreement.  Upon a termination
constituting Qualified Termination (as defined in the Change of Control
Agreement), all rights of Executive with respect to salary continuation, life
insurance, medical insurance and disability benefits shall be governed solely by
the Change of Control Agreement unless Executive shall elect to have all such
rights governed by the applicable terms of this Agreement (including a
determination of whether the termination  was voluntary or involuntary), in
which case the Change of Control Agreement shall have no effect as to such
rights (upon such election, the nature of the termination, e.g. voluntary,
involuntary or for Specified Voluntary Termination, shall be determined by
reference to this Agreement and shall not be determined by reference to the
classification of the termination under the Change of Control Agreement).  To be
effective, written notice of such election must be furnished by Executive to the
Company within seven days following the Qualified Termination.

     6.   AGREEMENT NOT TO SOLICIT OR COMPETE.
          ----------------------------------- 

     (a)  Upon the termination of employment at any time, then for a period of
two years after the termination of the Employment Period, Executive shall not
under any circumstances employ, solicit the employment of, or accept unsolicited
the services of, any "protected person" or recommend the employment of any
"protected person" to any other business organization.  A "protected person"
shall be a person known by Executive (i) to be employed by the Company or its
Subsidiaries or (ii) to have been employed by Company or its Subsidiaries within
six months prior to the commencement of conversations with such person with
respect to employment.

                                      -8-
<PAGE>
 
     As to (i) each "protected person" to whom the foregoing applies, (ii) each
limitation on (A) employment, (B) solicitation and (C) unsolicited acceptance of
services of each "protected person" and (iii) each month of the period during
which the provisions of this Subsection (a) apply to each of the foregoing, the
provisions set forth in this Subsection (a) are deemed to be separate and
independent agreements and in the events of unenforceable agreement shall be
deemed automatically deleted from the provisions hereof and such deletion shall
not affect the enforceability of any other provision of this Subsection (a) or
any other term of this Agreement.

     (b)  During the course of his employment, Executive has learned many trade
secrets of the Company and has had access to confidential information and
business plans for the Company.  Therefore, if Executive should end his
employment voluntarily at any time prior to January 25, 1997, including by
reason of retirement or disability, or if the Company should end Executive's
employment at any time for Cause prior to January 25, 1997, then for a period of
two years thereafter, Executive will not engage, either as a principal,
employee, partner, consultant or investor (other than a less-than-1% stock
interest in a corporation), in a business which is a competitor of the Company
(a "Competitive Business").  The foregoing noncompetition provision shall not
apply to any such voluntary or any other termination on or after January 25,
1997.  A business shall be deemed a Competitive Business if and only if it shall

operate home improvement warehouse stores (such as Home Depot, Builders Square,
Lowe's or Home Quarters) or warehouse wholesale clubs (such as Sams, Price Club,
Costco or Pace).  Nothing herein shall restrict the right of Executive to engage
in a business that operates exclusively conventional or full mark-up department
stores or general merchandise discount department stores.  In addition, if
during a period of salary continuation under Section 5(a)(i) or 5(b)(i)
following Executive's termination by the Company for any reason other than
Cause, Executive so engages in a Competitive Business (whether or not the
provisions of this paragraph (b) are otherwise then applicable to Executive),
Executive's rights to any further salary continuation or benefits continuation
under Sections 5(a)(i) and 5(a)(ii) and 5(b)(i) and 5(b)(ii) shall terminate.
Executive agrees that if, at any time, pursuant to action of any court,
administrative or governmental body or other arbitral tribunal, the operation of
any part of this paragraph shall be determined to be unlawful or otherwise
unenforceable, then the coverage of this paragraph shall be deemed to be
restricted as to duration, geographical scope or otherwise, to the extent, and
only to the extent, necessary to make this paragraph lawful and enforceable in
the particular jurisdiction in which such determination is made.

                    CHANGE OF CONTROL SEVERANCE AGREEMENT
                    -------------------------------------


     THIS AMENDED AND RESTATED AGREEMENT between Waban Inc., a Delaware
corporation (the "Company"), and Herbert J. Zarkin ("Executive"), dated as of
May 25, 1993.

     Executive is a key executive of the Company or a Subsidiary and an integral
part of its management.

     The Company recognizes that the possibility of a change of control of the
Company may result in the departure or distraction of management to the
detriment of the Company and its shareholders.

     The Company wishes to assure Executive of fair severance should his
employment terminate in specified circumstances following a change of control of
the Company and to assure Executive of certain other benefits upon a change of
control.

     In consideration of Executive's continued employment with the Company or a
Subsidiary and other good and valuable consideration, the parties agree that
Executive's present Change of Control Severance Agreement dated as of June 23,
1989 shall be amended and restated to read as follows:

     1.  Benefits Upon Change of Control.
         ------------------------------- 

     1.1.  In General.  Within 30 days following a Change of Control, whether or
           ----------                                                           
not Executive's employment has been terminated, the Company shall pay to
Executive the following in a lump sum:

          (a) an amount equal to the "Target Bonus" under the Waban Inc.
     Management Incentive Plan or any other annual incentive plan which is
     applicable to Executive for the fiscal year in which the Change of Control
     occurs;

     1.2.  Benefits Following Qualified Termination of Employment.  Executive
           ------------------------------------------------------            
shall be entitled to the following benefits upon a Qualified Termination:

      (a) Within 30 days following the Date of Termination, the Company shall
pay to Executive the following in a lump sum:

          (i) an amount equal to two times Executive's Base Salary for one year
          at the rate in effect immediately prior to the Date of Termination or
          the Change of Control, plus the accrued and unpaid portion of
<PAGE>
 
          Executive's Base Salary through the Date of Termination.  Any payments
          made to Executive under any  long term disability plan of the Company
          with respect to the two years following termination of employment
          shall be offset against such two times Base Salary payment.  Executive
          shall promptly make reimbursement payments to the Company to the
          extent any such disability payments are received after the Base Salary
          payment.

          (ii) an amount equal to two times Executive's automobile allowance for
          one year at the rate in effect immediately prior to the Date of
          Termination or the Change of Control, plus any portion of Executive's
          auto allowance payable but unpaid through the Date of Termination;
          provided, that no payment shall be due under this subparagraph (iii)
          --------                                                            
          if Executive is entitled to use of an automobile under paragraph
          1.2(c) below.
 
     (b) Until the second anniversary of the Date of Termination, the Company
shall maintain in full force and effect for the continued benefit of Executive
and his family all life insurance, medical insurance and disability plans and
programs in which Executive was entitled to participate immediately prior to the
Change of Control, provided that Executive's continued participation is possible
under the general terms and provisions of such plans and programs.  In the event
that Executive is ineligible to participate in such plans or programs, the
Company shall arrange upon comparable terms to provide Executive with benefits
substantially similar to those which he is entitled to receive under such plans
and programs.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Company's obligations
hereunder with respect to life, medical or disability coverage or benefits shall
be deemed satisfied to the extent (but only to the extent) of any such coverage
or benefits provided by another employer.

     1.3.  Coordination With Certain Tax Rules.  Payments under Sections 1.1 and
           -----------------------------------                                  
1.2 shall be made without regard to whether the deductibility of such payments
(or any other payments to or for the benefit of Executive) would be limited or
precluded by Internal Revenue Code Section 280G and without regard to whether
such payments (or any other payments) would subject Executive to  the federal
excise tax levied on certain "excess parachute payments" under Internal Revenue
Code Section 4999; provided , that if the total of all payments to or for the
                   --------                                                  
benefit of Executive, after reduction for all federal taxes (including the tax
described in Internal Revenue Code Section 4999, if applicable) with respect to
such payments ("Executive's total after-tax payments"), would be increased by
the limitation or elimination of any payment under Sections 1.1 or 1.2, amounts

                                    - 2 -
<PAGE>
 
payable under Sections 1.1 and 1.2 shall be reduced to the extent, and only to
the extent, necessary to maximize Executive's total after-tax payments.  The
determination as to whether and to what extent payments under Sections 1.1 or
1.2 are required to be reduced in accordance with the preceding sentence shall
be made at the Company's expense by Coopers & Lybrand or by such other certified
public accounting firm as the Executive Compensation Committee of the Company's
Board of Directors may designate prior to a Change of Control.  In the event of
any underpayment or overpayment under Sections 1.1 or 1.2, as determined by
Coopers & Lybrand (or such other firm as may have been designated in accordance
with the preceding sentence), the amount of such underpayment or overpayment
shall forthwith be paid to Executive or refunded to the Company, as the case may
be, with interest at the applicable Federal rate provided for in Section
7872(f)(2) of the Internal Revenue Code.
 
     2.  Noncompetition; No Mitigation of Damages; Other Severance Payments;
         -------------------------------------------------------------------
Withholding.
- ----------- 

     2.1.  Noncompetition.  Upon a Change of Control, any agreement by Executive
           --------------                                                       
not to engage in competition with the Company subsequent to the termination of
his employment, whether contained in an employment contract or other agreement,
shall no longer be effective.

     2.2.  No Duty to Mitigate Damages.  Executive's benefits under this
           ---------------------------                                  
Agreement shall be considered severance pay in consideration of his past service
and his continued service from the date of this Agreement, and his entitlement
thereto shall neither be governed by any duty to mitigate his damages by seeking
further employment nor offset by any compensation which he may receive from
future employment.

     2.3.  Other Severance Payments.  Following a Change of Control, any rights
           ------------------------                                            
of Executive under this Agreement or any other agreement or plan with respect to
uncompleted MIP periods shall be governed solely by this Agreement.  Upon a
termination constituting Qualified Termination (as defined in this Agreement),
all rights of Executive with respect to salary continuation, life insurance,
medical insurance and disability benefits shall be governed solely by this
Agreement, unless Executive shall elect to have all such rights governed by the
applicable terms of his Employment Agreement  determination of whether the
termination was voluntary or in which case this Agreement shall have no effect
as to such rights (upon such  election, the nature of the termination, e.g.
voluntary, involuntary or Specified Voluntary Termination, shall be determined
by reference to the Employment Agreement and shall not be determined by
reference to the classification of the


                                    - 3 -

termination under this Agreement).  To be effective, written notice of such

required to be made by the Company hereunder to Executive shall be subject to
the withholding of such amounts, if any, relating to tax and other payroll
deductions as the Company may reasonably determine it should withhold pursuant
to any applicable law or regulation.

     3.  Arbitration.  Any controversy or claim arising out of or relating to
         -----------

termination of his employment during a Standstill Period is for Cause or other
than for good reason (as defined in paragraph (k) of Exhibit A) or in obtaining
any right or benefit to which Executive is entitled under this Agreement.  Any
amount payable under this Agreement that is not paid when due shall accrue
interest at the base rate as from time to time in effect at the First National
Bank of Boston, until paid in full.

     5.  Notice of Termination.  During a Standstill Period, Executive's

employment may be terminated by the Company (or a Subsidiary) only upon 30 days'
written notice to Executive.

     6.  Notices.  All notices shall be in writing and shall be deemed given
         -------

Executive with respect to such matter was not taken or omitted in contravention
of any applicable policy or directive of the Board), gross neglect of duties

     (j) "Incapacity" shall mean a disability (other than Disability within the
meaning of the immediately preceding definition) or other impairment of health
that renders Executive unable to perform his duties to the satisfaction of the
Executive Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors of the Company.  If

the voluntary termination by Executive of his employment (A) within 120 days
after the occurrence without Executive's express written consent of any of the
events described in clauses (I), (II), (III), (IV), (V) or (VI) below, provided
that Executive gives notice to the Company at least 30 days in advance

<PAGE>
 
          requirements, and status with the Company (or a Subsidiary)
          immediately prior to a Change of Control, or a substantive change in
          Executive's titles or offices as in effect immediately prior to a
          Change of Control, or any removal of Executive from or any failure to
          reelect him to such positions, except in connection with the
          termination of Executive's employment by the Company for Cause or by
          Executive other than for good reason; or any other action by the
          Company which results in a diminishment in such position, authority,

          inadvertent action which is remedied by the Company promptly after
          receipt of notice thereof given by Executive; or

    (II)  if Executive's rate of Base Salary for any fiscal year is less than
          100 percent of the rate of Base Salary paid to Executive in the
          completed fiscal year immediately preceding the Change of Control, or
          if Executive's total cash compensation opportunities, including salary
          and incentives, for any fiscal year are less than 100 percent of the
          total cash compensation opportunities made available to Executive in
          the completed fiscal year immediately preceding the Change of Control,
          unless any further reduction represents an overall reduction in the
          rate of Base Salary paid or cash compensation opportunities made
          available, as the case may be, to executives in the same
          organizational level (it being the Company's  burden to establish this
          fact); or

   (III)  the failure of the Company to continue in effect any benefits or
          perquisites, or any pension, life insurance, medical insurance or
          disability plan in which Executive was participating immediately prior
          to a Change of Control unless the Company provides Executive with a
          plan or plans that provide substantially similar benefits, or the
          taking of any action by the Company that would adversely affect
          Executive's participation in or materially reduce Executive's benefits
          under any of such plans or deprive Executive of any material fringe
          benefit enjoyed by Executive immediately prior to a Change of Control,
          unless the elimination or reduction of any such benefit, perquisite or
          plan affects all other executives in the same organizational level (it
          being the Company's burden to establish this fact); or

    (IV)  any purported termination of Executive's employment by the Company for
          Cause during a Standstill Period which


                                   - 10 -
<PAGE>
 
          is not effected in compliance with paragraph (b) of this Exhibit; or

     (V)  any relocation of Executive of more than 40 miles from the place where
          Executive was located at the time of the Change of Control; or

    (VI)  any other breach by the Company of any provision of this Agreement; or

   (VII)  the Company sells or otherwise disposes of, in one transaction or a
          series of related transactions, assets or earning power aggregating
          more than 30 percent of the assets (taken at asset value as stated on
          the books of the Company determined in accordance with generally
          accepted accounting principles consistently applied) or earning power
          of the Company (on an individual basis) or the Company and its
          subsidiaries (on a consolidated basis) to any other Person or Persons
          (as those terms are defined in Exhibit B); or

  (VIII)  the voluntary termination by Executive of his employment (i) at any
          time within one year after the Change of Control or (ii) at any time
          during the second year after the Change of Control until the Company
          (or a Subsidiary) offers Executive an employment contract having a
          minimum two-year duration which provides Executive with substantially
          the same title, responsibilities, annual and long-range compensation,
          benefits and perquisites that he had immediately prior to the
          Standstill Period.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Board of
          Directors of the Company may expressly waive the application of this
          clause (VIII) if it waives the applicability of substantially similar
          provisions with respect to all persons with whom the Company has a
          written severance agreement (or may condition its application on any
          additional requirements or employee agreements which such Board shall
          in its discretion deem appropriate in the circumstances).  The
          determination of whether to waive or impose conditions on the
          application of this clause (VIII) shall be within the complete
          discretion of the Board of Directors of the Company but shall be made
          prior to the Change of Control.
 
     (l) "Standstill Period" shall be the period commencing on the date of a
Change of Control and continuing until the close of business on the last
business day of the 24th calendar month following such Change of Control.

     acquiring control is excluded from the definition of the term "Person"
     hereunder or (ii) unless the Committee shall otherwise determine prior to
     such occurrence, if the Executive or an Executive Related Party is the
     Person or a member of a group constituting the Person acquiring control; or

          (b)  any Person other than the Company, any wholly-owned subsidiary of
     the Company, or any employee benefit plan of the Company or such a
     subsidiary becomes the owner of 20% or more of the Company's Common Stock

     group constituting the Person acquiring such ownership; or

          (c)  there occurs any solicitation or series of solicitations of
     proxies by or on behalf of any Person other than the Company's Board of
     Directors and thereafter individuals who were not directors of the Company

     Executive or any Executive Related Party shall own equity securities of any
     surviving corporation ("Surviving Entity") having a fair value as a
     percentage of the fair value of the equity securities of such Surviving
     Entity greater than 125% of the fair value of the equity securities of the
     Company owned by the Executive and any Executive Related Party immediately
     prior to such transaction, expressed as a percentage of the fair value of
     all equity securities of the Company immediately prior to such transaction
     (for purposes of this paragraph ownership of equity securities shall be
     determined in the same manner as ownership of Common Stock); and provided,

     requires as a condition precedent approval by the Company's shareholders of
     the agreement or transaction, a Change of Control shall not be deemed to
     have taken place unless and until such approval is secured (but upon any
     such approval, a Change of Control shall be deemed to have occurred on the
     date of execution of such agreement).

     In addition, for purposes of this Exhibit B the following terms have the
meanings set forth below:
 
     "Common Stock" shall mean the then outstanding Common Stock of the Company

options or otherwise.  Notwithstanding the foregoing,  the term Common Stock
shall not include shares of Preferred Stock or convertible debt or options or
warrants to acquire shares of Common Stock (including any shares of Common Stock

     A Person shall be deemed to be the "owner" of any Common Stock:

     Commission (the "Commission") under the Exchange Act, as in effect on March
     1, 1989; or

          (ii) of which such Person would be the "beneficial owner" for purposes

     such terms are defined in Rule 12b-2 promulgated by the Commission under
     the Exchange Act, as in effect on March 1, 1989) has the right to acquire

     otherwise.

     "Person" shall have the meaning used in Section 13(d) of the Exchange Act,
as in effect on March 1, 1989; provided, however, that the term "Person" shall
                               --------  -------

12b-2 under the Exchange Act (the term "registrant" in the definition of
"associate" meaning, in this case, the Company).

so defined.

     2.   SCOPE OF EMPLOYMENT.

material respect upon the time required by Executive for the performance of 
his duties under this Agreement or is otherwise incompatible with those 
duties.

each fiscal year, Executive shall be eligible to earn up to a specified 
percentage of his Base Salary as a Target Award or as a Maximum Award, as the 
case may be. The Target Award shall equal 30% of Executive's Base Salary, and 
the Maximum Award shall equal 60% of Executive's Base Salary. Immediately 
prior to Executive's entering into an escrow agreement for the purchase of a 
home in southern California, but not later than December 31, 1993, if then 
employed hereunder, Executive shall receive payment of $94,615 (which equals 
his  Target Award for fiscal 1994). Such payment shall be credited against 
amounts, if any, subsequently payable with respect to Executive's fiscal 1994 
MIP Award, which shall be based on the performance of BJ's Wholesale Club and 
shall not give recognition to Executive's increase in base salary on the 
Effective Date.

     (d)   Policies and Fringe Benefits.  Executive shall be subject to 
           -----------------------------
Company policies applicable to its executives generally and Executive shall be
entitled to receive all such fringe benefits as the Company shall from time to
time make available to other executives generally (subject to the terms of the
applicable fringe benefits plan).

     (e)   Relocation and Real Estate Assistance.  The Company undertakes the 
           -------------------------------------
following:

           (i)  The Company shall retain, at its expense, a third party 
relocation firm to arrange for appraisals of the fair market value of 
Executive's residence in Chestnut Hill, Massachusetts and to offer to purchase
such residence for cash at the average of the appraised values so obtained,  
subject to customary conditions.

           (ii)  The Company shall reimburse Executive for all relocation costs
reasonably incurred by Executive. In the case of Executive's existing 
residence in Chestnut Hill and the residence first purchased by Executive in 
California, in addition to the Company's undertaking in paragraph (i) above, 
the Company's obligations shall be limited to reimbursing Executive for legal 
costs, any transfer taxes and other normal and reasonable costs (including, 
but not limited to, packing and moving expenses, and other expenses covered 
under the Company's existing relocation policy) incurred by Executive upon any
such sale and purchase.

           (iii)  The Company shall pay Executive an additional $50,000 as a 
relocation bonus with respect to all other relocation expenses which might be 
incurred by Executive, including any legal expenses in negotiating this 
Agreement. Such payment shall be made in conjunction with the Company's 
guaranteed MIP payment under Section 3(c).

           (iv)   Upon Executive's entering into an escrow agreement for the 
first purchase by Executive of a residence in Southern California during the 
Employment Period, the Company will pay Executive an additional $100,000 
relocation bonus.

           (v)    The Company will pay Executive's temporary living expenses 
in California until the earlier of (a) March 31, 1994, or (b) Executive's 
establishment of a permanent residence is California.

           (vi)   The Company shall make additional "gross-up" payments to 
Executive in the amount of any additional federal or state income taxes 
payable by Executive solely as a result of the Company's payments under 
clauses (ii) and (v) above. The Company will not be obligated to gross-up

                                     -4-
<PAGE>
 
any other payments or consideration it provides to Executive under this 
Agreement.

     (f)   Housing Loan.   To facilitate Executive's relocation from 
           ------------
Massachusetts to California, the Company will, at the closing of the first 
purchase by Executive of a residence in California, loan Executive $700,000. 
The loan shall not bear interest and shall mature on January 25, 2001. Unless 
the loan shall have earlier been accelerated, the Company shall forgive 
$100,000 principal amount of the loan on each of January 25, 1995, 1996, 1997,
1998, 1999, 2000 and 2001, whether or not Executive shall then be employed 
hereunder. The Company shall also pay for Executive's benefit a total of 
$190,000 of federal and state withholding taxes (the "Loan Cash Payment"). 
The Loan Cash Payment shall be paid in installments on one or more dates of 
forgiveness of principal in an amount proportionate to the amount of the Loan 
which Executive recognizes as forgiven on his federal tax return for any year 
(so that the Loan Cash Payment would be $27,142.86 in each of seven years if 
such tax recognition occurred in equal annual amounts over seven years). The 
loan shall automatically be accelerated and become due 60 days after 
termination in the event Executive shall voluntarily terminate his employment 
hereunder or shall be terminated by the Company for Cause. The loan and the 
Company's obligation to make Loan Cash Payments shall remain in effect 
following termination for any other reason, including but not limited to a 
Qualified Termination pursuant to the Change of Control Agreement. The loan 
shall be secured by a valid and perfected first or second mortgage on the 
first residence purchased by Executive in California. The aggregate face 
amount of all indebtedness secured by mortgages on such residence shall not 
exceed the purchase price of such residence. The loan shall be evidenced by a 
note, which note and mortgage shall have terms and conditions reasonably 
satisfactory to the Company. The net proceeds from any sale of such residence 
shall be applied to reduce or eliminate the loan and such net proceeds shall 
be subsequently reloaned by the Company to Executive on a similar 
secured basis by the Company at the closing of Executive's subsequent purchase
of another residence within  or outside California. Such reloan shall have the
same terms and maturity date as the original loan and shall be treated as 
constituting part of the original loan, if any part of the original loan is 
then outstanding. Upon a  reloan, Executive shall receive credit for any debt 
forgiveness and Loan Cash Payments which would have occurred had the loan been
continuously outstanding. Such repayment and relending provisions shall apply 
to all subsequent sales and purchases of residences by Executive.

     The Company's obligation under this Subsection 3(f) shall terminate if 
Executive does not close on the purchase of a home in Southern California on 
or before May 31, 1994.

     4.   TERMINATION OF EMPLOYMENT; IN GENERAL.
          -------------------------------------

     (a)  The Company shall have the right to end the Employment Period (and 
thereby terminate Executive's employment) at any time, with or without notice,
and for any reason with or without Cause.

     (b)  Unless otherwise prohibited by law, the Employment Period shall 
terminate when Executive becomes Disabled. In addition, if by reason of 
Incapacity Executive is unable to perform his duties for at least six 
continuous months, upon written notice by the Company to Executive the 
Employment Period will be terminated for Incapacity.

     (c)  Whenever the Employment Period shall terminate, Executive shall 
resign all offices or other positions he shall hold with the Company and any 
affiliated corporations, including any position on the Board.

     5.   BENEFITS UPON TERMINATION OF EMPLOYMENT.
          ---------------------------------------

     (a)  Certain Terminations.  If the Employment Period shall have
          --------------------
terminated prior to, on or after January 27, 1996 (i) by reason of death, 
Disability or Incapacity of Executive, or (ii) by termination by the Company 
for any reason other than Cause, then all compensation and benefits for 
Executive shall be as follows:

          (i)   For 52 weeks after such termination, or until January 28, 1996 
(in the case of termination occurring prior to January 28, 1995), the Company 
will continue to pay to Executive Base Salary at the rate in effect at 
termination of employment. Base Salary shall be paid for the first three 
months of the period without reduction for compensation earned from other 
employment or self-employment, and shall thereafter be reduced by such 
compensation earned from other employment or self-employment.

          (ii)  Until the expiration of the period of Base Salary payments 
described in (i) above, except to the extent that Executive shall obtain the 
same from another employer or from self-employment, the Company will provide 
such medical and hospital insurance and term life insurance for Executive and 
his family, comparable to the insurance provided for executives generally, as 
the Company shall determine, and upon the same terms and conditions as the 
same shall be provided for other Company executives generally; provided, 
                                                               --------
however, that in no event shall such benefits or the terms and conditions 
- -------
thereof be less favorable to Executive than those afforded to him as of the 
date of termination.

                                     -6-

<PAGE>
 
          (iii)  The Company will pay to Executive, without offset for 
     compensation earned from other employment or self-employment, the
     following amounts under the Company's MIP applicable to Executive:

     .    First, if not already paid, any amounts to which Executive is
          entitled under MIP for the fiscal year of the Company ended
          immediately prior to Executive's termination of employment. These
          amounts will be paid at the same time as other awards for such prior
          year are paid.

     .    Second, an amount equal to Executive's MIP Target Award for the year
          of termination, prorated for Executive's period of service during
          such year prior to termination. This amount will be paid at the same
          time as other MIP awards for the year of termination are paid.

     In addition, the Company will pay to Executive such amounts as Executive
     shall have deferred (but not received) under the Company's General
     Deferred Compensation Plan in accordance with the provisions of that
     Plan.

          (iv)  Executive shall also be entitled to the benefits with respect 
     to any PARS and Stock Options of Executive held on the date of
     termination, only to the extent provided under the Waban 1989 Plan in the
     circumstances. In addition, Executive shall be entitled to benefits under
     other Company plans only to the extent, if any, therein provided in the
     circumstances.

          (v)   If termination occurs by reason of Incapacity or Disability, 
     Executive shall be entitled to such compensation, if any, as is payable
     pursuant to the Company's long-term disability plan or any successor
     Company disability plan. Any payments made to Executive under any long
     term disability plan of the Company with respect to the salary
     continuation period in clause (i) above shall be offset against such
     salary continuation payments and to the extent not so offset, Executive
     shall promptly make reimbursement payments to the Company of such
     disability payments.

     (b)  Certain Voluntary Terminations; Termination for Cause; Violation of 
          ------------------------------------------------------------------
Certain Agreements.  If Executive should end his employment voluntarily at any
- ------------------
time prior to, on or after January 27, 1996 or if the Company should at any 
time end Executive's employment for Cause, or, notwithstanding (a) above, if 
Executive should at any time violate the provisions of Section 6, all 
compensation and benefits otherwise payable pursuant to this Agreement shall 
cease, other than (x) such

                                     -7-
<PAGE>

amounts as Executive shall have deferred (but not received) under the Company's
General Deferred Compensation Plan in accordance with the provisions of that
Plan, (y) any benefits to which Executive may be entitled with respect to any 
PARS and Stock Options held on such date only as provided under the Waban 1989
Plan in the circumstances and (z) any benefits to which Executive may be 
entitled under other Company plans only to the extent, if any, therein 
provided in the circumstances. The Company does not waive any rights, 
including rights it may have for damages or for injunctive relief.

     (c)  Benefits Upon Change of Control.  Upon a Change of Control (as 
          ------------------------------- 
defined in the Change of Control Agreement) any stock options then held by 
Executive shall automatically become fully exercisable and all restrictions and
conditions, including vesting conditions, applicable to any shares of restricted
stock (including PARS) then held by Executive shall be deemed automatically
waived. Following a Change of Control (as defined in the Change of Control 
Agreement), any rights of Executive under this Agreement or any other agreement
or plan with respect to uncompleted MIP or LRMIP periods or cycles shall be 
governed solely by the Change of Control Agreement.  Upon a Qualified 
Termination (as defined in the Change of Control Agreement), all rights of 
Executive with respect to salary continuation, life insurance, medical 
insurance and disability benefits and auto allowance or auto lease benefits 
shall be governed solely by the Change of Control Agreement but Sections 3(e) 
and 3(f) hereof shall remain in effect notwithstanding the occurrence of a 
Change of Control or Qualified Termination.

     6.  AGREEMENT NOT TO SOLICIT OR COMPETE.
         -----------------------------------

     (a)  Upon the termination of employment at any time for any reason, then
for a period of two years after the termination of the Employment Period,
Executive shall not under any circumstances employ, solicit the employment of,
or accept unsolicited the services of, any "protected person" or recommend the
employment of any "protected person" to any other business organization. A
"protected person" shall be a person known by Executive (i) to be employed by
the Company or its Subsidiaries or (ii) to have been employed by the Company or
its Subsidiaries within six months prior to the commencement of conversations
with such person with respect to employment.

     As to (i) each "protected person" to whom the foregoing applies, (ii) each
limitation on (A) employment, (B) solicitation and (C) unsolicited acceptance 
of services of each "protected person" and (iii) each month of the period during
which the provisions of this Subsection (a) apply to each of the foregoing, the
provisions set forth in this Subsection (a) are deemed to be separate and
independent agreements and in the events of unenforceable agreement shall be
deemed automatically deleted

                                     -8-

<PAGE>
 
from the provisions hereof and such deletion shall not affect the 
enforceability of any other provision of this Subsection (a) or any other term
of this Agreement.

     (b)  During the course of his employment, Executive has learned many 
trade secrets of the Company and has had access to confidential information 
and business plans for the Company. Therefore, if Executive should end his 
employment voluntarily at any time prior to, on or after January 27, 1996, 
including by reason of retirement or disability, or if the Company should end 
Executive's employment at any time for Cause, then for a period of two years 
thereafter, Executive will not engage, either as a principal, employee, 
partner, consultant or investor (other than a less-than-1% stock interest in a
corporation), in a business which is a competitor of the Company (a 
"Competitive Business"). A business shall be deemed a Competitive Business if 
and only if it shall then be so regarded by retailers or wholesalers 
generally, or if it shall operate home improvement warehouse stores (such as 
Home Depot, Builders Square, Lowe's or Home Quarters) or warehouse clubs (such
as Sams, Price Club, Costco or Pace). Nothing herein shall restrict the right 
of Executive to engage in a business that operates exclusively conventional or
full mark-up department stores or general merchandise discount department 
stores. In addition, if during a period of salary continuation under Section 
5(a)(i) or 5(b)(i) following Executive's termination by the Company for any 
reason other than Cause, Executive so engages in a Competitive Business, 
Executive's rights to any further salary continuation or benefits continuation 
under Sections 5(a)(i) and 5(a)(ii) shall terminate. Executive agrees that if,
at any time, pursuant to action of any court, administrative or governmental 
body or other arbitral tribunal, the operation of any part of this paragraph 
shall be determined to be unlawful or otherwise unenforceable, then the 
coverage of this paragraph shall be deemed to be restricted as to duration, 
geographical scope or otherwise, to the extent, and only to the extent, 
necessary to make this paragraph lawful and enforceable in the particular 
jurisdiction in which such determination is made.

     (c) During the Employment Period and upon termination for any reason,
Executive shall keep confidential and not disclose Company plans or other
confidential or proprietary information of the Company to any unauthorized
person unless legally required to do so, in which case Executive will first
notify the Company and cooperate with the Company to obtain a judicial or
administrative order protecting such confidentiality. If the Employment Period
terminates, Executive agrees (i) to notify the Company promptly upon his
securing employment or becoming self-employed during any period when
Executive's compensation from the Company shall be subject to reduction or his
benefits provided by the Company shall be subject to termination as provided
in Section 5 and (ii) to furnish to the Company written evidence of his

                                    -9- 

<PAGE>
 
compensation earned from any such employment or self-employment as the Company
shall from time to time reasonably request. In addition, upon termination of 
the Employment Period for any reason other than the death of Executive, 
Executive shall immediately return all Company property and all written trade 
secrets, confidential information and business plans of the Company and shall 
execute a certificate certifying that he has returned all such items in his 
possession or under his control.

     7.   ASSIGNMENT.  The rights and obligations of the Company (including, 
          ----------
without limitation, the provisions of Section 3(f)) shall enure to the benefit
of and shall be binding upon the successors and assigns of the Company. The 
rights and obligations of Executive are not assignable except only that 
payments payable to him after his death shall be made by devise or descent.

     8.   NOTICES.  All notices and other communications required hereunder
          -------
shall be in writing and shall be given by mailing the same by certified or 
registered mail, return receipt requested, postage prepaid. If sent to the 
Company the same shall be mailed to the Company at One Mercer Road, Natick, 
Massachusetts 01701, Attention: President, or such other address as the 
Company may hereafter designate by notice to Executive; and if sent to 
Executive, the same shall be mailed to Executive at 228 Allendale Road, 
Apartment 2D, Chestnut Hill, Massachusetts 02167 or at such other address as 
Executive may hereafter designate by notice to the Company.

     9.   WITHHOLDING.  Anything to the contrary notwithstanding, all payments 
          -----------
required to be made by the Company hereunder to Executive shall be subject to 
the withholding of such amounts, if any, relating to tax and other payroll 
deductions as the Company may reasonably determine it should withhold pursuant
to any applicable law or regulation.

     10.  GOVERNING LAW.  This Agreement and the rights and obligations of the
          -------------
parties hereunder shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the 
domestic substantive laws of The Commonwealth of Massachusetts without giving 
effect to any choice or conflict of laws rule or provision that would cause 
the application of the domestic substantive laws of any other jurisdiction.

     11.  CONSENT TO JURISDICTION, ETC.  Each party hereto (i) irrevocably 
          ----------------------------
submits to the nonexclusive jurisdiction of the state courts of The 
Commonwealth of Massachusetts and to the nonexclusive jurisdiction of the 
United States District Court for the District of Massachusetts for the purpose
of any suit, action, or other proceeding arising out of or based upon this 
Agreement or the subject matter hereof or in any way connected with or related

                                    -10-

hereto in connection with any of the above; (ii) agrees that any such 
proceeding shall be brought or maintained only in such courts; (iii) waives to
the extent not prohibited by applicable law, and agrees not to assert (by way 
of motion, as a defense, or otherwise) in any such proceeding, any claim that 
it or he is not subject personally  to the jurisdiction of the above-named 
courts, that it or he is immune from extraterritorial injunctive relief or 
other injunctive relief, that its or his property is exempt or immune from 
attachment or execution, that any such proceeding may not be properly brought 
or maintained in one of the above-named courts, that any such proceeding 
brought or maintained in one of the above-named courts should be dismissed on 
grounds of forum non conveniens, should be transferred to any court other than
           ----- --- ----------
one of the above-named courts, or should be stayed by reason of the pendency
of some other proceeding in any court other than one of the above-named
courts, or that this Agreement or the subject matter hereof may not be
enforced in or by any of the above-named courts; (iv) agrees that service of
process in any such proceeding may be made in any manner permitted by the law
applicable in the court where any such proceeding is brought or maintained or
by registered or certified mail, return receipt requested, at its or his
principal place of business to its or his notice address for purposes of this
Agreement; (v) agrees that service of process made in accordance with clause
(iv) is reasonably calculated to give actual notice of any such proceeding;
and (vi) waives and agrees not to assert (by way of motion, as a defense, or
otherwise) in any such proceeding any claim that service of process made in
accordance with clause (iv) does not constitute good and sufficient service
of process.

     12.  SEVERABILITY.  In the event that any provision of this Agreement 
          ------------
shall be determined to be invalid or unenforceable, such provision shall be 
enforceable in any other jurisdiction in which valid and enforceable and in

the fullest extent permitted by law.

     13.  AMENDMENT OF MODIFICATION, WAIVER.  This Agreement may not be amended 
          --------------------------------- 
unless agreed to in writing by Executive and the Company. No waiver by either 
party of any breach of this Agreement shall be deemed a waiver of a subsequent
breach.

                    CHANGE OF CONTROL SEVERANCE AGREEMENT
                    -------------------------------------


     THIS AMENDED AND RESTATED AGREEMENT between Waban Inc., a Delaware
corporation (the "Company"), and Allan P. Sherman ("Executive"), dated as of
September 29, 1993.

     Executive is a key executive of the Company or a Subsidiary and an 
integral part of its management.

     The Company recognizes that the possibility of a change of control of the
Company may result in the departure or distraction of management to the
detriment of the Company and its shareholders.

     The Company wishes to assure Executive of fair severance should his
employment terminate in specified circumstances following a change of control
of the Company and to assure Executive of certain other benefits upon a change
of control.

     In consideration of Executive's continued employment with the Company or
a Subsidiary and other good and valuable consideration, the parties agree as
follows:

     1.  Benefits Upon Change of Control.
         ------------------------------- 

     1.1.  In General.  Within 30 days following a Change of Control, whether
           ----------                                                        
or not Executive's employment has been terminated, the Company shall pay to
Executive the following in a lump sum:

          (a) an amount equal to the "Target Bonus" under the Waban Inc.
     Management Incentive Plan or any other annual incentive plan which is
     applicable to Executive for the fiscal year in which the Change of
     Control occurs (or if Executive's title was changed to a level below that
     of Executive's Current Title within 180 days before the commencement of a
     Standstill Period, the "Target Bonus" applicable to Executive for the
     fiscal year in which such change occurred as if he continued to hold
     Executive's Current Title, if higher); and

          (b) if Executive is a participant in the Waban Inc. Long Range
     Management Incentive Plan or any other performance-based long-range
     incentive plan ("LRMIP") at the Change of Control, an amount with respect
     to each Award Period (as that term is defined in LRMIP) for which
     Executive has been designated as an LRMIP participant equal to 50 percent

<PAGE>
 
     the maximum award payable to Executive for such Award Period, as
     designated by the Company's Executive Compensation Committee under LRMIP
     (or, if Executive's title was changed to a level below that of
     Executive's Current Title within 180 days before the commencement of a
     Standstill Period, in the case of an Award Period which commences after
     such change, the maximum award payable to Executive for such Award Period
     shall be deemed to be the maximum award payable to Executive for the
     Award Period which commenced immediately prior to such change, if
     higher), and (ii) a fraction, the denominator of which is the total
     number of fiscal years in the Award Period and the numerator of which is
     the number of fiscal years which have elapsed in such Award Period prior
     to the Change of Control (for purposes of this fraction, if the Change of
     Control occurs during the first quarter of a fiscal year, then one-
     quarter of the fiscal year shall be deemed to have elapsed prior to the
     Change of Control, and if the Change of Control occurs after the first
     quarter of the fiscal year, then the full fiscal year shall be deemed to
     have elapsed prior to the Change of Control).

     1.2.  Benefits Following a Qualified Termination of Employment.
           --------------------------------------------------------  
Executive shall be entitled to the following benefits upon a Qualified
Termination:

       (a) Within 30 days following the Date of Termination, the Company shall
pay to Executive the following in a lump sum:

           (i) an amount equal to two times Executive's Base Salary for one
           year at the rate in effect immediately prior to the Date of
           Termination or the Change of Control (or if Executive's title was
           changed to a level below that of Executive's Current Title within
           180 days before the commencement of a Standstill Period, the rate
           in effect immediately prior to such change), whichever is highest,
           plus the accrued and unpaid portion of Executive's Base Salary
           through the Date of Termination. Any payments made to Executive
           under any long term disability plan of the Company with respect to
           the two years following termination of employment shall be offset
           against such two times Base Salary payment. Executive shall
           promptly make reimbursement payments to the Company to the extent
           any such disability payments are received after the Base Salary
           payment; and

           (ii) an amount equal to two times Executive's automobile allowance
           for one year at the rate in effect immediately prior to the Date of
           Termination or the Change of Control (or if Executive's title was
           changed to a level below that of Executive's Current Title within
           180 days before the commencement of a Standstill 

                                     -2-
<PAGE>
 
           Period, the rate in effect immediately prior to such change),
           whichever is highest, plus any portion of Executive's auto
           allowance payable but unpaid through the Date of Termination;
           provided, that no payment shall be due under this subparagraph
           --------
           (iii) if Executive is entitled to use of an automobile under
           paragraph 1.2(c) below.

     (b) Until the second anniversary of the Date of Termination, the Company 
shall maintain in full force and effect for the continued benefit of Executive
and his family all life insurance, medical insurance and disability plans and
programs in which Executive was entitled to participate immediately prior to
the Change of Control (or if Executive's title was changed to a level below
that of Executive's Current Title within 180 days before the commencement of a
Standstill Period, all such plans and programs in which Executive was entitled
to participate immediately prior to such change, if the benefits thereunder
are greater), provided that Executive's continued participation is possible
under the general terms and provisions of such plans and programs. In the
event that Executive is ineligible to participate in such plans or programs,
the Company shall arrange upon comparable terms to provide Executive with
benefits substantially similar to those which he is entitled to receive under
such plans and programs. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Company's
obligations hereunder with respect to life, medical or disability coverage or
benefits shall be deemed satisfied to the extent (but only to the extent) of
any such coverage or benefits provided by another employer.

     (c) For a period of two years after the Date of Termination, the Company
shall make available to Executive the use of any automobile that was made
available to Executive prior to the Date of Termination, including ordinary
replacement thereof in accordance with the Company's automobile policy in
effect immediately prior to the Change of Control, or if Executive's title was
changed to a level below that of Executive's Current Title within 180 days
before the commencement of a Standstill Period, the Company shall make
available to Executive the use of an automobile of a type comparable to the
automobile that was made available to him immediately prior to such change
(or, in lieu of making such automobile available, the Company may at its
option pay to Executive the present value of its cost of providing such
automobile).
 
     1.3.  Coordination With Certain Tax Rules.  Payments under Sections 1.1
           -----------------------------------                              
and 1.2 shall be made without regard to whether the deductibility of such
payments (or any other payments to or for the benefit of Executive) would be
limited or precluded by Internal Revenue Code Section 280G and without regard
to whether such payments (or any other payments) would subject Executive to
the federal excise tax levied on certain "excess parachute

                                     -3-
<PAGE>
 
payments" under Internal Revenue Code Section 4999; provided, that if the
                                                    --------
total of all payments to or for the benefit of Executive, after reduction for
all federal taxes (including the tax described in Internal Revenue Code
Section 4999, if applicable) with respect to such payments ("Executive's total
after-tax payments"), would be increased by the limitation or elimination of
any payment under Sections 1.1 or 1.2, amounts payable under Sections 1.1 and
1.2 shall be reduced to the extent, and only to the extent, necessary to
maximize Executive's total after-tax payments. The determination as to whether
and to what extent payments under Sections 1.1 or 1.2 are required to be
reduced in accordance with the preceding sentence shall be made at the
Company's expense by Coopers & Lybrand or by such other certified public
accounting firm as the Executive Compensation Committee of the Company's Board
of Directors may designate prior to a Change of Control. In the event of any
underpayment or overpayment under Sections 1.1 or 1.2, as determined by
Coopers & Lybrand (or such other firm as may have been designated in
accordance with the preceding sentence), the amount of such underpayment or
overpayment shall forthwith be paid to Executive or refunded to the Company,
as the case may be, with interest at the applicable Federal rate provided for
in Section 7872(f)(2) of the Internal Revenue Code.

Executive not to engage in competition with the Company subsequent to the

other agreement, shall no longer be effective.

           ---------------------------                                  
Agreement shall be considered severance pay in consideration of his past
service and his continued service from the date of this Agreement, and his
entitlement thereto shall neither be governed by any duty to mitigate his
damages by seeking further employment nor offset by any compensation which he
may receive from future employment.

     2.3.  Other Severance Payments.  Following a Change of Control, any
           ------------------------                                     
rights of Executive under any agreement or plan with respect to uncompleted
MIP or LRMIP periods or cycles shall be governed solely by this Agreement.
Upon a Qualified Termination (as defined in this Agreement), all rights of
Executive with respect to salary continuation, life insurance, medical
insurance and disability benefits and auto allowance or auto lease benefits
shall be governed solely by this Agreement.

     2.4.  Withholding.  Anything to the contrary notwithstanding, all
           -----------                                                
payments required to be made by the Company

regulation.

expenses, including but not limited to counsel fees, stenographer fees,
printing costs, etc. reasonably incurred by Executive in contesting or
disputing that the termination of his employment during a Standstill Period is
for Cause or other than for good reason (as defined in paragraph (k) of
Exhibit A) or in obtaining any right or benefit to which Executive is entitled
under this Agreement. Any amount payable under this Agreement that is not paid
when due shall accrue interest at the prime rate as from time to time in
effect at the First National Bank of Boston, until paid in full.

     5.  Notice of Termination.  During a Standstill Period, Executive's
         ---------------------                                          
employment may be terminated by the Company (or a Subsidiary) only upon 30

          Subsidiary) which results in a diminishment in such position,
          authority, duties or responsibilities, other than an insubstantial

          Subsidiary promptly after receipt of notice thereof given by
          Executive; or

    (II)  if Executive's rate of Base Salary for any fiscal year is less than
          100 percent of the rate of Base Salary paid to Executive in the
          completed fiscal year immediately preceding the Change of Control,
          or if Executive's total cash compensation opportunities, including
          salary and incentives, for any fiscal year are less than 100 percent
          of the total cash compensation opportunities made available to
          Executive in the completed fiscal year immediately preceding the
          Change of Control, unless any reduction represents an overall
          reduction in the rate of Base Salary paid or cash compensation
          opportunities made available, as the case may be, to executives in
          the same organizational level (it being the Company's burden to
          establish this fact); or

   (III)  the failure of the Company (or a Subsidiary) to continue in effect
          any benefits or perquisites, or any pension, life insurance, medical
          insurance or disability plan in which Executive was participating

          Subsidiary) provides Executive with a plan or plans that provide

          Executive immediately prior to a Change of Control, unless the
          elimination or reduction of any such benefit, perquisite or plan
          affects all other executives in the same organizational level (it
          being the Company's burden to establish this fact); or

    (IV)  any purported termination of Executive's employment by the Company

     (V)  any relocation of Executive of more than 40 miles from the place
          where Executive was located at the time of the Change of Control; or

    (VI)  any other breach by the Company of any provision of this Agreement;
          or

   (VII)  the Company sells or otherwise disposes of, in one transaction or a
          series of related transactions, assets or earning power aggregating
          more than 30 percent of the assets (taken at asset value as stated
          on the books of the Company determined in accordance with generally
          accepted accounting principles consistently applied) or earning
          power of the Company (on an individual basis) or the Company and its
          subsidiaries (on a consolidated basis) to any other Person or
          Persons (as those terms are defined in Exhibit B); or

  (VIII)  if Executive is employed by a Subsidiary of the Company, such
          Subsidiary either ceases to be a Subsidiary of the Company or sells
          or otherwise disposes of, in one transaction or a series of related
          transactions, assets or earning power aggregating more than 30
          percent of the assets (taken at asset value as stated on the books
          of the Subsidiary determined in accordance with generally accepted
          accounting principles consistently applied) or earning power of such
          Subsidiary (on an individual basis) or such Subsidiary and its

     (IX) the voluntary termination by Executive of his employment (i) at any
          time within one year after the Change of Control or (ii) at any time
          during the second year after the Change of Control until the Company
          (or a Subsidiary) offers Executive an employment contract having a
          minimum two-year

                                    -11-

          duration which provides Executive with substantially the same title,
          responsibilities, annual and long-range compensation, benefits and
          perquisites that he had immediately prior to the Standstill Period.
          Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Board of Directors of the Company
          may expressly waive the application of this clause (IX) if it waives
          the applicability of substantially similar provisions with respect
          to all persons with whom the Company has a written severance
          agreement (or may condition its application on any additional
          requirements or employee agreements which such Board shall in its
          discretion deem appropriate in the circumstances). However, in the
          case of a Change of Control pursuant to paragraph (e) of the
          definition of Change of Control, any such waiver or conditions shall
          not extend beyond 11 months following the Change of Control. The
          determination of whether to waive or impose conditions on the
          application of this clause (IX) shall be within the complete
          discretion of the Board of Directors of the Company but shall be
          made prior to the Change of Control.
 
      (k) "Standstill Period" shall be the period commencing on the date of a
  Change of Control and continuing until the close of business on the last

  directly or indirectly, 50 percent or more of the total combined voting power
  of all classes of stock.

       "Change of Control" shall mean the occurrence of any one of the following
  events:

            (a)  there occurs a change of control of the Company of a nature

                                      --------  -------                     
       shall be deemed to be a Change of Control (i) if the person or each
       member of a group of persons acquiring control is excluded from the
       definition of the term "Person" hereunder or (ii) unless the Committee
       shall otherwise determine prior to such occurrence, if the Executive or
       an Executive Related Party is the Person or a member of a group
       constituting the Person acquiring control; or

            (b)  any Person other than the Company, any wholly-owned subsidiary
       of the Company, or any employee benefit plan of the Company or such a
       subsidiary becomes the owner of 20% or more of the Company's Common Stock
       and thereafter individuals who were not directors of the Company prior to
       the date such Person became a 20% owner are elected as directors pursuant
       to an arrangement or understanding with, or upon the request of or
       nomination by, such Person and constitute at least 1/4 of the Company's
       Board of Directors; provided, however, that unless the Committee shall

       otherwise determine prior to the acquisition of such 20% ownership, such
       acquisition of ownership shall not constitute a Change of Control if the
       Executive or an Executive Related Party is the Person or a member of a
       group constituting the Person acquiring such ownership; or

            (c)  there occurs any solicitation or series of solicitations of

       consolidation which contemplates that (i) after the effective date
       provided for in such agreement, all or substantially all of the business
       and/or assets of the Company shall be owned, leased or otherwise
       controlled by another Person and (ii) individuals who are directors of
       the Company when such agreement is executed shall not constitute a
       majority of the board of directors of the survivor or successor entity

       transaction shall constitute a Change of Control if, immediately after
       such transaction, the Executive or any Executive Related Party shall own
       equity securities of any surviving corporation ("Surviving Entity")
       having a fair value as a percentage of the fair value of the equity
       securities of such Surviving Entity greater than 125% of the fair value
       of the equity securities of the Company owned by the Executive and any
       Executive Related Party immediately prior to such transaction, expressed
       as a percentage of the fair value of all equity securities of the Company
       immediately prior to such transaction (for purposes of this paragraph
       ownership of equity securities shall be determined in the same manner as
       ownership of Common Stock); and provided, further, that, for purposes of
                                       --------  -------                       
       this paragraph (d), if such agreement requires as a condition precedent
       approval by the Company's shareholders of the agreement or transaction, a
       Change of Control shall not be deemed to have taken place unless and
       until such approval is secured (but upon any such approval, a Change of
       Control shall be deemed to have occurred on the date of execution of such
       agreement); or

            (e)  substantially all the assets of the HomeBase division are
       acquired by any Person other than one or more Subsidiaries of the Company
       or the Company discontinues the business of the HomeBase division.

       In addition, for purposes of this Exhibit B the following terms have the
  meanings set forth below:
 
       "Common Stock" shall mean the then outstanding Common Stock of the
  Company plus, for purposes of determining the stock ownership of any Person,
  the number of unissued shares of Common Stock which such Person has the

  rights, warrants or options or otherwise. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the
  term Common Stock shall

                                    -14-
<PAGE>
 
  not include shares of Preferred Stock or convertible debt or options or
  warrants to acquire shares of Common Stock (including any shares of Common
  Stock issued or issuable upon the conversion or exercise thereof) to the
  extent that the Board of Directors of the Company shall expressly so determine
  in any future transaction or transactions.

       A Person shall be deemed to be the "owner" of any Common Stock:

            (i)  of which such Person would be the "beneficial owner," as such
       term is defined in Rule 13d-3 promulgated by the Securities and Exchange
       Commission (the "Commission") under the Exchange Act, as in effect on
       March 1, 1989; or

            (ii) of which such Person would be the "beneficial owner" for
       purposes of Section 16 of the Exchange Act and the rules of the
       Commission promulgated thereunder, as in effect on March 1, 1989; or

            (iii)  which such Person or any of its affiliates or associates (as
       such terms are defined in Rule 12b-2 promulgated by the Commission under
       the Exchange Act, as in effect on March 1, 1989) has the right to acquire
       (whether such right is exercisable immediately or only after the passage
       of time) pursuant to any agreement, arrangement or understanding or upon
       the exercise of conversion rights, exchange rights, warrants or options
       or otherwise.

       "Person" shall have the meaning used in Section 13(d) of the Exchange
  Act, as in effect on March 1, 1989; provided, however, that the term "Person"
                                      --------  -------                        
  shall not include (a) any individuals who are descendants of Max Feldberg or
  Morris Feldberg, (b) any relatives of the fourth degree of consanguinity or
  closer of such descendants or (c) custodians, trustees or legal
  representatives of such persons.
 
       An "Executive Related Party" shall mean any affiliate or associate of the
  Executive other than the Company or a Subsidiary of the Company.  The terms
  "affiliate" and "associate" shall have the meanings ascribed thereto in Rule
  12b-2 under the Exchange Act (the term "registrant" in the definition of
  "associate" meaning, in this case, the Company).

          5.3  Application of Proceeds from Sale of the Property; Subsequent
               -------------------------------------------------------------
Loans.  Borrower agrees that in the event he sells the Property, he will cause

the net proceeds from such sale to be applied to reduce the principal
outstanding under the Loan and all other sums owing under the Loan Documents.
Borrower agrees to give Lender prior written notice of any such sale of the
Property.  So long as the Loan is required to remain in effect in accordance

principal residence within or outside the State of California prior to January
25, 2001, then Lender shall make a new loan ("New Loan") to Borrower at the
closing of Borrower's subsequent purchase of such other principal residence in
an amount equal to the net proceeds from the sale of the Property which have
been repaid to Lender, which New Loan shall be on the same terms and
conditions as set forth in the Loan Documents, including the maturity date,
and which shall be secured by a first or second mortgage or deed of trust
encumbering such new principal residence. The New Loan shall be considered a
part of the Loan if any portion of the Loan is still outstanding at the time
the New Loan is made. At the time Lender makes the New Loan to Borrower, the
principal amount thereof shall be reduced by any debt reductions which would
have occurred under Section 2.2 above and any Loan Cash Payments will be paid
to Borrower which would have been paid under the Employment Agreement, had the
Loan been continuously outstanding. The foregoing provisions shall apply to
all subsequent sales and purchases of principal residences by Borrower prior
to January 25, 2001, so long as the Loan is required to remain in effect in
accordance with the provisions of the Employment Agreement.

                                                               January 19, 1994

          FOR VALUE RECEIVED, the undersigned, ALLAN P. SHERMAN, an unmarried

("Holder"), or order, the principal sum of Seven Hundred Thousand Dollars
($700,000.00), without interest, at One Mercer Road, Natick, Massachusetts
01760, or at such other place as from time to time may be designated in writing
by the holder of this Note.

          1.  Loan Agreement.  This Note is the Note referred to in that certain
              --------------                                                    
Loan Agreement of even date herewith (the "Loan Agreement") between Maker and

terms not otherwise defined herein shall have the meanings set forth in the Loan
Agreement.

          2.  Principal Reduction.  As provided in Section 2.2 of the Loan
              -------------------                                         
Agreement, Holder shall reduce the principal balance hereunder by the sum of One
Hundred Thousand Dollars ($100,000.00) on each of January 25, 1995, 1996, 1997,

          3.  Maturity Date.  The entire unpaid outstanding principal balance
              -------------

              ------------------------------------                       
principal balance due under this Note at any time in whole or in part.  All
payments hereunder are to be applied first to the discharge of any expenses or

terms of this Note, the Deed of Trust (defined below) or the Loan Agreement, and
the balance remaining applied to the payment of principal.  All payments to be
made under this Note shall be payable in lawful money of the United State of
America which shall be legal tender for public and private debts at the time of
payment.

          5.  Security.  This Note shall be secured by a deed of trust ("Deed of
              --------                                                          
Trust") of even date herewith, encumbering real property described therein, in

                   -----------------                                           
     following shall constitute an "Event of Default" hereunder:

<PAGE>
 
                    (i)  Performance of Obligations.  If Maker fails to timely
                         --------------------------                           
          perform any of his obligations or agreements contained in or required
          by the Loan Documents or any other document executed therewith or
          required thereby or there is any other default under the Loan
          Documents; or

                    (ii)  Default Under Senior Lien.  If Maker defaults in the
                          -------------------------                           
          payment of any principal or interest under the note secured by the
          "Senior Lien" (as defined in the Loan Agreement) or other indebtedness
          secured by the Senior Lien or breaches or defaults in the performance
          of any other term, covenant, condition or obligation under the
          Senior Lien or document executed in connection with or evidencing
          the Senior Lien, including, without limitation, any deed of trust or
          assignment of rents, which is not cured within the applicable cure
          period set forth therein.

               (b)  Remedies on Default.  Upon the occurrence of an "Event of
                    -------------------                                      
     Default" and at the option of the Holder, the unpaid principal balance
     hereof shall without demand or notice become immediately due and payable
     and Holder may exercise all other rights and remedies provided under the
     Loan Agreement or other documents executed in connection therewith or
     required thereby or otherwise available under applicable law.  No delay or
     omission on the part of Holder in exercising any right under this Note
     shall operate as a waiver of such right.  All rights and remedies of Holder
     provided in this Note and the other Loan Documents, at law, in equity or
     otherwise are cumulative and not excessive, and Holder may exercise any and
     all such rights and remedies at any time.

          7.   Waiver.  Maker for himself, his legal representatives, successors
               ------                                                           
and assigns and all other persons liable or to become liable on this Note,
jointly and severally, waives presentment for payment, demand, notice of demand
and of dishonor and nonpayment of this Note, notice of intention to accelerate
the maturity of this Note, protest and notice of protest, diligence in
collecting, and the bringing of suit against any other party, and agrees to all
renewals, extensions, modifications, partial payments, releases or substitutions
of security, in whole or in part, with or without notice, before or after
maturity.  Maker waives, to the full extent permissible by law, any right he may
have to plead any and all statutes of limitation as a defense to any demands on
this Note.  No single or partial exercise of any power hereunder or under the
Deed of Trust or any other instrument securing this Note shall preclude other or
further exercise thereof, or the exercise of any other power.  Holder shall at
all times have the right to proceed against any portion of the security held
heretofore in such order and in such manner as Holder may deem fit without
waiving any rights with respect to any other security.  The release by Holder of
any party liable on this Note shall not operate to release any other party
liable hereon.

          8.   Attorneys' Fees.  Should the indebtedness represented by this
               ---------------                                              
Note or any part hereof not be paid by Maker when due, or if any Event of
Default occurs, Maker shall pay the costs of enforcement and collection
including, but not limited to, reasonable attorneys' fees, whether or not such
enforcement and collection includes the filing of a lawsuit.

          9.   Severability.  Every provision of this Note is intended to be
               ------------                                                 
severable.  In the event that any term or provision hereof is declared to be
illegal or invalid for any reason

                                       2
<PAGE>
 
whatsoever by a court of competent jurisdiction, such illegality or invalidity
shall not affect the balance of the provisions hereof, which terms and
provisions remain binding and enforceable.

          10.  Governing Law.  This Note shall be construed and enforced in
               -------------                                               
accordance with the laws of the State of California.

          11.  Absolute and Unconditional.  No reference herein to any other
               --------------------------                                   
instrument or agreement and no provisions of this Note or any such instrument or
agreement shall alter or impair the obligation of Maker, which is absolute and
unconditional, to pay the principal of this Note at the place, respective times
and in the manner herein prescribed.

          12.  Parties Bound.  This Note shall be binding upon the undersigned,
               -------------                                                   
his heirs, executors, administrators and assigns, and the terms hereof shall
inure to the benefit of Holder and its successors and assigns.
