                       UNITED TELEPHONE COMPANY OF FLORIDA
                              1995 FORM 10-K/PART I


Item 1.   Business
- -------   --------

United  Telephone  Company of Florida (the  Company) is a  subsidiary  of Sprint
Corporation (Sprint). The principal executive offices of the Company are located
at 555 Lake Border Drive, Apopka, Florida 32703.

The Company was formed as the result of a  combination  effective  December  31,
1982,  pursuant  to an  Agreement  and Plan of  Merger,  in which the  Company's
affiliates,  the former  United  Telephone  Company of Florida,  The Winter Park
Telephone  Company and Orange City Telephone  Company,  Incorporated were merged
into Florida Telephone  Corporation  (FTC). As the surviving  corporation,  FTC,
which had been incorporated  under the laws of the State of Florida on September
29,  1925,  amended  its  articles of  incorporation  to provide for a change of
corporate name to United Telephone Company of Florida.

The Company is engaged in the business of  furnishing  communications  services,
principally  local,   network  access  and  long  distance   services,   serving
approximately  1,165,000  customers  in  all or  part  of 24  Florida  counties,
comprising  some 30 percent of the state's  total area.  The  Company's  current
estimate of  population  within its service  areas is 2.5 million as compared to
census  counts of  approximately  1.8  million in 1990,  1.0 million in 1980 and
600,000 in 1970.

The Company had 6,089  employees at December  31,  1995,  of which 2,689 or 44.2
percent are represented by either the  Communications  Workers of America or the
International  Brotherhood  of  Electrical  Workers  for  collective  bargaining
purposes.  Of the  6,089  employees,  1,321 are  dedicated  to  serving  Central
Telephone Company of Florida, an affiliated company which reimburses the Company
for the related employee costs.

In addition to furnishing local service,  the Company's central offices and toll
lines are connected with other telephone  companies and with the nationwide toll
networks of  interexchange  carriers  (IXCs) for the  provision  of message toll
service  and other long  distance  services.  Toll calls may thus be made to any
telephone   in   the   United   States   and   most   other   countries.   Other
telecommunications  services,  for the most part furnished in  conjunction  with
other telephone  companies,  include  facilities for private line service,  data
transmission and wide area toll service (WATS).

Revenues from communications  services constituted 84.9 percent of the operating
revenues of the Company in 1995. The remaining 15.1 percent was derived  largely
from directory  operations,  equipment sales,  facilities leases and billing and
collection  services  provided to IXCs. A  significant  portion of the Company's
network  access  revenue is derived from network  access  billings to AT&T Corp.
(AT&T).  However,  the Company does not believe its revenues are dependent  upon
AT&T, as customers' demand for interLATA long distance  telephone service is not
tied to any one long  distance  carrier.  As the  market  share of  AT&T's  long
distance  competitors  increases,  the percent of revenues  derived from network
access services provided to AT&T decreases.

</TABLE>

In 1987, the Company  formed United  Telephone Long  Distance,  Inc.  (UTLD),  a
Florida  corporation,  and in 1988 the Florida Public Service  Commission (FPSC)
granted UTLD's  request for  certification  as an  interexchange  carrier.  UTLD
resells WATS  service as  interLATA  message  telephone  service from  exchanges
within the Company's service area.

The  Company  is  subject  to the  jurisdiction  of the  Federal  Communications
Commission (FCC) and the FPSC.

Effective January 1, 1991, the FCC adopted a price cap regulatory format for the
Bell  Operating  Companies  and the GTE local  exchange  companies.  Other local
exchange  companies (LECs) could  voluntarily become subject to the price cap
regulation.  Under  price  caps,  prices for  access  service  must be  adjusted
annually to reflect  industry  average  productivity  gains (as specified by the
FCC),  inflation  and certain  allowed cost changes.  The Company  elected to be
subject to price cap  regulation,  and under the form of the plan  adopted,  the
Company  had the  opportunity  to earn up to a 15.25  percent  rate of return on
investment on its interstate  operations through June 30, 1995. During 1995, the
FCC adopted modifications to the price cap plan to reset productivity elections,
change  certain  rate  adjustment  methods,  address new service  offerings  and
generally  reduce  regulatory  requirements.  Under these  changes,  the Company
elected a productivity factor that allows it to avoid sharing interstate access
earnings.

Item 1.   Business (continued)
- -------   --------------------

In June 1994, the Company  entered into a stipulation  with the FPSC whereby the
Company's  intrastate  rates were  reduced by $17.6  million on an annual  basis
beginning July 1, 1994.  Approximately $9.9 million of the rate reduction was in
intrastate access elements and was intended to bring the intrastate access rates
more in line with  interstate  rates.  Approximately  $5.0  million  of the rate
reduction  was in  intraLATA  toll  rates,  and $2.7  million  in local  service
revenue.  In addition,  the Company agreed to record additional  depreciation of
$2.8 million  ($2.1  million  intrastate),  which was  recognized  in the second
quarter.  The Company's  allowed  intrastate return on equity was capped at 13.0
percent for 1994 with any  earnings in excess of 13.0  percent to be deferred to
1995 when the upper range of the allowed return reverted to 13.5 percent.

In November  1994, in compliance  with FPSC  regulations,  the Company filed its
triennial  depreciation study seeking an increase in annual depreciation expense
of approximately  $16.3 million effective  January 1, 1995. In this filing,  the
Company  sought  shorter  service  lives to  recognize  obsolescence  caused  by
emerging  technologies  required to meet customer demands for more sophisticated
voice and data facilities.  On January 17, 1995, the FPSC allowed the Company to
implement,  on a preliminary  basis,  the proposed rates,  reduced by a one-time
depreciation  charge of $3.2 million ($2.4 million intrastate) to be recorded in
1994, which served to bring the Company's 1994 intrastate return on equity below
the 13.0 percent cap noted above. On March 1, 1995, the Office of Public Counsel
filed a petition  for a hearing in protest of the FPSC's  approval  of the early
implementation of the depreciation rates.

On December 1, 1994, the FPSC approved the Company's proposal, filed November 2,
1994, for additional  rate reductions with an effective date of January 1, 1995.
The total  proposed  revenue  reduction was $10.6 million in 1995, $9 million of
which was in switched  access  charge  reductions  and the remainder in cellular
interconnection usage rates and intraLATA toll rates.

In September 1995, the FPSC approved an increase in annual depreciation  expense
of $18.9 million.  The new depreciation rates were effective January 1, 1995 and
had been  substantially  recognized under the preliminary order discussed above.
In addition,  the FPSC determined that the Company had exceeded its 13.0 percent
cap by $1.5 million including interest for 1994 and required that this amount be
included in the determination of the Company's 1995 intrastate return on equity.
In  recognition  of this  recent  FPSC  order,  the $3.2  million of  additional
depreciation  recorded in December,  1994,  due to the  preliminary  order,  was
reversed in September 1995.

Item 1.  Business (continued)
- -------  --------------------

On July 1, 1995,  telecommunications  reform  legislation became law in Florida.
This legislation allows competition in the local telephone marketplace beginning
January  1,  1996,  while  replacing  rate  of  return   regulation  with  price
regulation.  While the  Company  cannot  predict  the  ultimate  effects of this
legislation  on its future  operations,  it does not  expect a material  adverse
impact in the near term.

At the interstate  level, the FCC has revised its rules to permit  connection of
customer-owned  coin  telephones to the local  network,  exposing LECs to direct
coin telephone competition. Additionally, to facilitate competition in providing
access to interexchange carriers and end users, the FCC mandated that all Tier 1
LECs,  including the Company,  allow virtual  colocation of  Competitive  Access
Providers' equipment in LEC central offices.

The extent and ultimate  impact of competition for LECs will continue to depend,
to a considerable  degree, on FCC and state regulatory actions,  court decisions
and possible  federal and state  legislation.  Federal  legislation  designed to
stimulate local  competition  between local exchange service providers and cable
programming  service  providers  in both  markets has been  recently  passed and
signed  into  law.  See  "Management's  Discussion  and  Analysis  of  Financial
Condition and Results of Operations" for a discussion of this new law. While the
Company  cannot predict the ultimate  effects of this  legislation on its future
operations,  the  Company's  historical  prices and  market  share are likely to
decline as a result of increased local competition.

The  Company's  environmental   compliance  and  remediation   expenditures  are
primarily  related  to  the  operation  of  standby  power  generators  for  its
telecommunications equipment. The expenditures arise in connection with permits,
standards  compliance or occasional  remediation,  which may be associated  with
generators,  batteries  or fuel  storage.  The  Company  has been  designated  a
potentially responsible party at a site relating to landfill contamination.  The
Company's expenditures relating to environmental compliance and remediation have
not been  material  to the  financial  statements  or to the  operations  of the
Company and are not expected to have any future material effects.

Item 2.   Properties
- -------   ----------

The  properties  of  the  Company  consist  principally  of  land,   structures,
facilities and equipment. Substantially all of the telephone property, plant and
equipment is subject to the liens of the indentures securing the Company's first
mortgage debt. Of the Company's  investment in telephone  plant in service as of
December  31,  1995,  cable and wire  facilities  represented  approximately  50
percent of the total; central office equipment,  37 percent; land and buildings,
6 percent;  telephone  instruments  and certain related  equipment  installed on
subscriber premises, 2 percent; and, other telephone plant, 5 percent.

(1)       In the  fourth  quarter of 1995,  the  Company  determined  that it no
          longer met the criteria necessary for the continued application of the
          provisions of Statement of Financial  Accounting  Standards (SFAS) No.
          71,  "Accounting for the Effects of Certain Types of Regulation." As a
          result of the decision to discontinue the application SFAS No. 71, the
          Company  recorded a noncash  extraordinary  charge of $108.4  million,
          which is net of income tax  benefits  of $82  million.  (See Note 2 of
          Notes   to   Consolidated    Financial   Statements   for   additional
          information.) The years 1994 and 1993 include  extraordinary losses on
          early  extinguishments  of debt.  The  effects of such  losses were to
          decrease  net income by $215,000 and $1.4  million,  in 1994 and 1993,
          respectively.

(2)      During 1995,  Sprint  initiated a realignment and  restructuring of its
         local communications  services division,  including the elimination of
         approximately 250 of the Company's positions. These actions resulted in
         a nonrecurring  charge to the Company of $12.2  million,  which reduced
         net income by approximately $7.5 million.

(3)      During  1993,  nonrecurring  charges  of $51.1  million  were  recorded
         related to Sprint's merger with Centel  Corporation,  which reduced net
         income by approximately $31 million.

(4)      Effective January 1, 1994, and as a result of the Sprint/Centel merger,
         employees of an affiliate,  Central Telephone Company of Florida,  are,
         for payroll  processing and benefit purposes,  considered  employees of
         the  Company.  The access  lines served per employee at the end of 1995
         and 1994 exclude the 1,321 and 1,418, respectively, employees dedicated
         to serving Central Telephone Company of Florida.

Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results 
           of Operations 
           ------------- 

The Company's financial  well-being plays a vital role in its efforts to provide
efficient,  responsive,  state-of-the-art  communication services to the rapidly
growing Florida market amid the uncertainties created by deregulation.  In order
to meet the  challenges of this dynamic  environment,  the Company  continues to
seek ways to increase organizational efficiency through process improvements and
careful control of construction expenditures and automation and consolidation of
functions.  Concurrently, efforts have been undertaken to aggressively implement
new technologies,  including enhanced digital  switching,  fiber optics and pair
gain devices that offer expanded services at reduced costs.

Telecommunications Law
- ----------------------

In February 1996, the  Telecommunications  Act of 1996 (the Act) was signed into
law.  The  purpose  of the  Act is to  promote  competition  in all  aspects  of
telecommunications. The Act requires telecommunications carriers to interconnect
with other  carriers  and to provide for  resale,  number  portability,  dialing
parity,  access  to  rights-of-way  and  compensation  for  reciprocal  traffic.
Additionally,  incumbent  local  telephone  companies  are  required  to provide
nondiscriminatory  unbundled  access,  resale at  wholesale  rates and notice of
changes that would affect  interoperability of facilities and networks.  The FCC
is to adopt mechanisms to ensure that essential  telecommunications services are
affordable.

The Act also provides that regional Bell Operating Companies (RBOCs) may provide
long  distance  service  that is  out-of-region  or  incidental  to  audio/video
programming,  Internet  for  schools,  mobile  services,  information  or  alarm
services  and  telecommunications  signaling.  In order  for an RBOC to  provide
in-region  long  distance  service,  the Act  requires the RBOC to comply with a
comprehensive  competitive checklist and expands the role of the U.S. Department
of Justice in the FCC's  determination  of whether the entry of an RBOC into the
competitive long distance market is in the public interest.  Additionally, there
must be a real  facilities-based  competitor for  residential and business local
telephone  service (or the failure of  potential  providers  to request  access)
prior to an RBOC providing  in-region long distance service.  RBOCs must provide
long distance  services through a separate  subsidiary for at least three years.
Until the RBOCs are allowed into long distance or three years have passed,  long
distance  carriers with more than five percent of the nation's  access lines may
not jointly  market  RBOC resold  local  telephone  service,  and states may not
require RBOCs to provide intraLATA dialing parity.

Telecommunications  companies  may also  provide  video  programming  and  cable
operators  may  provide  telepone  service  in the same  service  area.  The Act
prohibits  telecommunications  carriers and cable  operators from acquiring more
than 10 percent of each other, except in rural and other specified areas.

The impact of the Act on the  Company is unknown  because a number of  important
implementation  issues (such as the nature and extent of continued subsidies for
local rates) still need to be decided by state or federal  regulators.  However,
the  Company's  historical  prices and  market  share are likely to decline as a
result of increased local competition.

Item 7.  Management's  Discussion  and Analysis of Financial  Condition and
           Results of Operations (continued)
           ---------------------------------

Liquidity and Capital Resources
- -------------------------------

As detailed in the  Consolidated  Statements of Cash Flows,  the Company had net
cash provided by its operating activities of $286 million, $294 million and $254
million in 1995, 1994 and 1993,  respectively.  While  operating  results of the
Company  improved in 1995,  operating cash flows decreased due to an increase in
the 1995 deferred tax benefit.

The  Company  has  significant  cash  requirements   because  of  its  need  for
substantial amounts of plant and equipment to provide communications services to
customers. The Company's planned construction expenditures for modernization and
growth in 1996 are  approximately  $202  million,  of which $90  million  is for
central office equipment, $67 million for cable and wire facilities, $17 million
for general support assets, $14 million for generic software and $14 million for
other telecommunications  assets. Actual expenditures were $167 million in 1995,
$178 million in 1994 and $185 million in 1993.

Because  the  Company is capital  intensive,  external  financing  is  sometimes
required to  supplement  cash  provided  by  operations.  The primary  source of
external financing has been through the issuance of debt. As of December,  1994,
$70  million  of the  commercial  paper  outstanding  had been  reclassified  as
long-term debt due to the refinancing of these  borrowings on a long-term basis.
In  addition,  on November  17, 1995,  the Company  retired,  prior to scheduled
maturity,  its 2 percent  and 6  percent  debt to the  Rural  Utilities  Service
(formerly  Rural  Electrification  Administration).  The principal,  unamortized
costs,  and prepayment  penalty was $774,000.  The Company issued $70 million of
8.38  percent  Series HH bonds on January 15,  1995.  Long-term  debt is further
detailed in Note 5 of Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements.

The average short-term debt outstanding was $35 million during 1995, $39 million
during  1994  and $35  million  during  1993.  At  year  end,  short-term  debt,
consisting primarily of commercial paper and advances from Sprint,  decreased by
$10 million in 1995, $27 million in 1994 and increased $16 million in 1993.

The Company  anticipates that substantially all of the cash required in 1996 for
its construction program and principal payments and retirement of long term debt
will be provided by  operating  activities.  If  additional  funds are  required
during  1996,  it is expected  that they will be raised  through the issuance of
commercial paper and bank borrowings. The Company maintains bank lines of credit
sufficient  to support  outstanding  commercial  paper and bank  borrowings  and
anticipates no difficulty in meeting potential external  financing  requirements
in this  manner  during  1996.  The Company  had lines of credit  totaling  $100
million at December 31, 1995, of which $70.3 million was unused.

           Results of Operations (continued)
           ---------------------------------

Liquidity and Capital Resources (continued)
- -------------------------------------------

At year end,  the  Company's  ratio of common  equity to total  capital was 55.5
percent in 1995, 58.8 percent in 1994 and 60.8 percent in 1993. The equity ratio
decreased  in 1995  primarily  due to the  noncash  charge  associated  with the
discontinued  application of SFAS No. 71 and restructuring charges. ( See Note 2
of Notes to Consolidated  Financial Statements.) The ratio of short-term debt to
total  capital was 2.8  percent in 1995,  3.4 percent in 1994 and 5.7 percent in
1993.

Financial Condition
- -------------------

The  Company's  consolidated  assets  totaled  $1.4 billion at December 31, 1995
compared to $1.7 billion at December 31, 1994.  Property,  plant and  equipment,
net of accumulated depreciation,  decreased $200.7 million from 1994 to 1995 due
primarily to the  discontinued  application of SFAS No. 71,  "Accounting for the
Effects  of Certain  Types of  Regulation",  during the fourth  quarter of 1995,
which resulted in a $192.6 million  increase to accumulated  depreciation.  (See
Note 2 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional discussion.)
Accounts payable  decreased $16.6 million from 1994 to 1995 primarily due to the
timing  of cash  disbursements.  Postretirement  and other  benefit  obligations
increased  $13.4 million from 1994 to 1995,  primarily due to the current year's
postretirement benefits costs.

Results of Operations
- ---------------------

Local service revenues are derived from providing  telephone  exchange services.
Local  service  revenues  increased in 1995  primarily due to increases in basic
area service revenues  reflecting access line growth of approximately  64,000 or
5.0  percent.  Also  contributing  to the  increase in 1995 was the  increase in
revenue for custom calling  features,  increased  equipment leases and increased
demand for inside wire maintenance contracts.

Network  access  service  revenues are derived from billing  other  carriers and
telephone customers for their use of the local network to complete long distance
calls in those instances where long distance service is not provided entirely by
the Company.  Network access service  revenues  increased  $10.4 million in 1995
primarily  due to  increased  minutes of use and  customer  activity  net of the
January 1, 1995 rate  reduction.  In  addition,  the adoption of the 5.3 percent
productivity rate for the FCC Interstate price cap plan, effective August, 1995,
eliminated the rate of return ceiling on interstate  earnings,  beginning  July,
1995, and therefore increased the retention of revenue.

Long distance  service  revenues are derived  principally  from  providing  long
distance services within designated areas.  Revenues decreased in 1995 primarily
due to rate  reductions  effective  January  1, 1995 and  because  of  increased
competition in this market.  Also  contributing to the reduction in 1995 revenue
was the conversion of certain short-haul toll routes to flat rate message plans.
These flat rate revenue streams are included in local service revenue.

Other revenues include revenues related to directory  publishing fees, providing
billing  and  collection   services  and  operator  services  for  interexchange
carriers,   sales  of  telecommunications   equipment  and  leasing  of  network
facilities.  Other  revenues  increased in 1995  primarily due to an increase in
directory  revenues and direct marketing services partially offset by a decrease
in equipment sales.

Plant expense increased in 1995 primarily due to increased access line movement,
increased  access lines in service,  repairs of cable and wire facilities due to
inclement weather and increases in computer and data expenses.

Depreciation  expense  increased  $17.6 million during 1995 primarily due to the
implementation of new depreciation  rates effective January 1, 1995 and also due
to the asset base growth between 1994 and 1995.

Customer  operations  expense  increased in 1995  primarily  due to increases in
expenses associated with expanded hours of business office operations, increases
in the number of customer contacts and increased directory expenses.

Corporate  operations expense decreased in 1995 due to a decrease in advertising
and general and administrative services provided by Sprint.

In November 1995,  Sprint initiated a realignment and restructuring of its local
communications services division, including the elimination of approximately 250
of the Company's  positions.  This  restructuring is geared toward  streamlining
current  processes  in order to  reduce  costs  in an  increasingly  competitive
marketplace.  These actions resulted in a nonrecurring  charge to the Company of
$12.2 million,  which reduced net income by $7.5 million.  The accrued liability
associated with this charge  specifically  relates to the benefits that affected
employees will receive upon termination.

Effective March 9, 1993, Sprint consummated its merger with Centel  Corporation,
a  telecommunications  company  with local  exchange  and  cellular and wireless
communications  services  operations  (see  Note  9  of  Notes  to  Consolidated
Financial  Statements  for  additional   information).   The  transaction  costs
associated with the merger (consisting primarily of investment banking and legal
fees) and the estimated expenses of integrating and restructuring the operations
of the two companies  (consisting primarily of employee severance and relocation
expenses  and  costs  of  eliminating  duplicative  facilities)  resulted  in  a
nonrecurring   charge  to  Sprint  during  1993.  The  portion  of  such  charge
attributable to the Company was $51.1 million,  which reduced 1993 net income by
approximately $31 million.

Item 7.  Management's  Discussion  and Analysis of Financial  Condition and
           Results of Operations (continued)
           ---------------------------------

Nonoperating Items
- ------------------

The increase in interest  charges in 1995 was  primarily  due to the issuance of
Series HH mortgage bonds in January, 1995 to replace short-term borrowings.

Extraordinary Items
- -------------------

As  described  in Note 2 of  Notes to  Consolidated  Financial  Statements,  the
Company  adopted  accounting  principles  for  a  competitive   marketplace  and
discontinued  applying SFAS No. 71, "Accounting for the Effects of Certain Types
of  Regulation,"  effective  December 31, 1995.  The  application of SFAS No. 71
required the  accounting  recognition  of the rate actions of  regulators  where
appropriate.  The  Company  determined  that it no longer met the  criteria  for
following SFAS No. 71 due to changes in the regulatory framework which continues
to evolve from rate-base  regulation to price  regulation as the latter does not
provide for the recovery of specific costs. In addition, the Company operates in
an evolving competitive  environment in which the level and types of competition
are  increasing  such that they may no longer  allow  for  service  and  product
pricing  that  provides  for the recovery of specific  costs.  As a result,  the
Company  recorded  a noncash,  extraordinary  charge of $108.4  million,  net of
related income tax benefits.

The Company incurred  extraordinary charges related to the early extinguishments
of debt of $215,000 and $1.4 million,  net of related  income tax  benefits,  in
1994 and 1993, respectively.

Effects of Inflation

The effects of inflation on the  operations of the Company were not  significant
during 1995, 1994 or 1993.

                         REPORT OF INDEPENDENT AUDITORS


The Board of Directors
United Telephone Company of Florida



We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of United Telephone
Company  of  Florida (the  Company),  a  wholly-owned   subsidiary  of  Sprint
Corporation,  as of  December  31, 1995 and 1994,  and the related  consolidated
statements of income,  retained  earnings,  and cash flows for each of the three
years in the period  ended  December  31,  1995.  Our audits also  included  the
financial statement schedule listed in the Index at Item 14(a)2. These financial
statements and the schedule are the responsibility of the Company's  management.
Our  responsibility  is to express an opinion on these financial  statements and
the schedule based on our audits.

We  conducted  our  audits  in  accordance  with  generally   accepted  auditing
standards.  Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material
misstatement.  An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting
the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements.  An audit also includes
assessing the  accounting  principles  used and  significant  estimates  made by
management,  as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation.
We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.

In our opinion, the consolidated  financial statements referred to above present
fairly, in all material  respects,  the consolidated  financial  position of the
Company at  December  31,  1995 and 1994,  and the  consolidated  results of its
operations  and its cash flows for each of the three  years in the period  ended
December 31, 1995, in conformity with generally accepted accounting  principles.
Also, in our opinion, the related financial statement schedule,  when considered
in relation to the basic financial statements taken as a whole,  presents fairly
in all material respects the information set forth therein.

As discussed in Note 2 to the  consolidated  financial  statements,  the Company
discontinued  accounting  for its  operations  in accordance  with  Statement of
Financial  Accounting  Standards No. 71,  "Accounting for the Effects of Certain
Types of Regulation," in 1995.

                       UNITED TELEPHONE COMPANY OF FLORIDA
                   NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
                                December 31, 1995


 1.   SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

      This  summary  of  significant  accounting  policies  of United  Telephone
      Company  of  Florida  is   presented  to  assist  in   understanding   the
      accompanying consolidated financial statements. The consolidated financial
      statements  and  notes  are   representations  of  management,   which  is
      responsible for their integrity and objectivity. These accounting policies
      conform  with  generally  accepted   accounting   principles  and  reflect
      practices appropriate to the industry in which United Telephone Company of
      Florida operates.

      Basis of Presentation
      ---------------------

      The accompanying consolidated financial statements include the accounts of
      United  Telephone  Company of  Florida  and its  wholly-owned  subsidiary,
      United  Telephone Long  Distance,  Inc.,  collectively  referred to as the
      "Company." All significant intercompany transactions have been eliminated.
      The Company is a wholly-owned  subsidiary of Sprint Corporation  (Sprint);
      accordingly, earnings per share information has been omitted.

      Certain   amounts   previously   reported  for  prior  periods  have  been
      reclassified  to  conform  to  the  current  period  presentation  in  the
      accompanying consolidated financial statements. Such reclassifications had
      no  effect  on the  results  of  operations  or  stockholder's  equity  as
      previously reported.

      The  preparation  of financial  statements  in conformity  with  generally
      accepted  accounting  principles requires management to make estimates and
      assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and
      disclosure  of  contingent  assets  and  liabilities  at the  date  of the
      financial  statements,  and the reported  amounts of revenues and expenses
      during the  reporting  period.  Actual  results  could  differ  from those
      estimates.

      Operations
      ----------

      The  Company  is  engaged  in the  business  of  providing  communications
      services,  principally local, network access and long distance services in
      Florida.  The Company  adopted  accounting  principles  for a  competitive
      marketplace  and  discontinued  accounting  for the  economic  effects  of
      regulation pursuant to Statement of Financial  Accounting Standards (SFAS)
      No. 71,  "Accounting  for the  Effects of  Certain  Types of  Regulation,"
      effective December 31, 1995 (See Note 2).

      As part of its cash management  program,  the Company utilizes  controlled
      disbursement  banking  arrangements.  Outstanding checks in excess of cash
      balances are reflected as a current  liability on the balance  sheet.  The
      company had sufficient  funds available to fund these  outstanding  checks
      when they were presented for payment.

      Inventories
      -----------

      Inventories consist of materials and supplies, stated at average cost, and
      equipment held for resale,  stated at the lower of average cost or market.
      The sales  inventory  balances were $9,200,000 and $11,494,000 at December
      31, 1995 and 1994, respectively.


      Property, Plant and Equipment
      -----------------------------

      Property,  plant  and  equipment  are  recorded  at cost.  Retirements  of
      depreciable property are charged against accumulated  depreciation with no
      gain or loss  recognized.  Repairs and  maintenance  costs are expensed as
      incurred.

      Depreciation
      ------------
      
      The cost of property,  plant and equipment is depreciated generally on the
      composite group remaining life method of  depreciation  and  straight-line
      composite  rates. In connection with the  discontinuation  of SFAS No. 71,
      the Company will begin  recording  depreciation  expense based on expected
      economic  useful  lives  in  1996.  Previously,  such  lives  relating  to
      regulated   property,   plant  and  equipment  were  those  prescribed  by
      regulatory  commissions.  Depreciation  rate changes,  special  short-term
      amortizations and nonrecurring charges approved by regulatory  commissions
      resulted in $15.7 million and $6 million increases in depreciation in 1995
      and 1994,  respectively,  and a $9.3 million  decrease in 1993.  After the
      related  effects on revenues  and income  taxes,  these items  reduced net
      income for 1995 and 1994 by  approximately  $8.4 million and $2.7 million,
      respectively,  and  increased  net income for 1993 by  approximately  $4.9
      million.  Average  annual  composite  depreciation  rates,  excluding  the
      nonrecurring  charges, were 8.0 percent for 1995, 6.8 percent for 1994 and
      6.7 percent for 1993.

      Income Taxes
      ------------

      Operations of the Company are included in the consolidated  federal income
      tax returns of Sprint.  Federal income tax is calculated by the Company on
      the basis of its filing a separate return.

      Deferred  income  taxes are  provided  for certain  temporary  differences
      between  the  carrying  amounts of assets and  liabilities  for  financial
      reporting purposes and the amounts used for tax purposes.

      Investment  tax credits (ITC) have been  deferred and are being  amortized
      over the estimated useful lives of the related property.

      Interest Charged to Construction
      --------------------------------

      In May 1994, the Florida Public Service  Commission  (FPSC) staff,  citing
      the  immateriality  of  interest  capitalized  on  long-term  construction
      projects, filed comments with the Federal Communications  Commission (FCC)
      supporting  the  elimination  of  interest  charged  to  construction.  In
      addition,  the FPSC  directed  the Company to cease  recognizing  interest
      charged to construction effective November 1, 1994. In February, 1995, the
      FCC issued an order  which not only  upheld the  calculation  of  interest
      during construction on long-term  construction  projects, but ordered that
      such  interest  be  calculated  on  all  projects  whose  estimated  gross
      additions exceed $100,000. The order was effective in September, 1995. The
      Company has complied with these regulatory orders.

      Impact of Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements
      ---------------------------------------------------

      In March 1995, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued SFAS
      No. 121,  "Accounting  for the  Impairment  of  Long-Lived  Assets and for
      Long-Lived  Assets to be Disposed Of," which is effective for fiscal years
      beginning after December 15, 1995. SFAS No. 121 requires that assets to be
      held and used be reviewed  for  impairment  whenever  events or changes in
      circumstances  indicate that the carrying  amount of the asset in question
      may not be  recoverable.  Management does not anticipate that SFAS No. 121
      will have a material effect on its 1996 operating results.

2.    ADOPTION OF ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES FOR A COMPETITIVE MARKETPLACE

      Effective  December 31, 1995, the Company determined that it no longer met
      the criteria necessary for the continued  application of the provisions of
      SFAS No. 71. As a result of the decision to discontinue the application of
      SFAS No. 71, the  Company  recorded  a  noncash,  extraordinary  charge of
      $108.4 million, net of income tax benefits of $82 million.

      The  Company's  determination  that  it was no  longer  eligible  for  the
      continued  application of the accounting required by SFAS No. 71 was based
      on changes in the  regulatory  framework,  which  continues to evolve from
      rate-base   regulation  to  price   regulation  and  the   convergence  of
      competition   in  the   telecommunications   industry.   Based   on  these
      occurrences,  the Company no longer  believes  that it can be assured that
      prices will be maintained at levels which will provide for the recovery of
      specific costs.

      The components of the  extraordinary  charge recognized as a result of the
      discontinued application of SFAS No. 71 are as follows (in thousands):

      The adjustment to the accumulated  depreciation  balance was determined by
      the  completion  of  depreciation  reserve  and  impairment  studies.  The
      depreciation reserve study analyzed, by individual plant asset categories,
      the impacts of  regulator-prescribed  depreciable  asset lives compared to
      the  Company's  estimated  economic  lives.  The  results  identified  the
      cumulative under depreciation of certain asset categories.  The impairment
      study,  which validated the results of the depreciation  study,  estimated
      the  impact on future  revenues  caused by price  changes  and  developing
      industry competition, and the resulting effects on cash flows.

      The  discontinued  application of SFAS No. 71 also required the Company to
      eliminate from its  consolidated  balance sheet the effects of any actions
      of regulators that had been recognized as assets and liabilities  pursuant
      to SFAS No.  71,  but  would  not  have  been  recognized  as  assets  and
      liabilities  by  enterprises  in  general.  The  elimination  of other net
      regulatory  assets  primarily  related to  capitalized  software costs and
      deferred debt extinguishment costs.

      The  tax-related  adjustments  were required to adjust deferred income tax
      amounts  to  the  currently  enacted  statutory  rates  and  to  eliminate
      tax-related  regulatory  assets  and  liabilities.  The  Company  uses the
      deferral method of accounting for investment tax credits and amortizes the
      credits as a reduction to tax expense over the life of the asset that gave
      rise to the tax  credit.  Since  plant  asset  lives were  shortened,  the
      related  investment  tax credits were  adjusted to reduce the  unamortized
      balance by a corresponding amount.

3.    EMPLOYEE BENEFIT PLANS

      Effective  January 1, 1994, as a result of the merger of Sprint and Centel
      Corporation  (Centel),  employees of Central Telephone Company of Florida,
      an affiliate,  are considered  employees of the Company.  As a result, the
      Company assumed the January 1, 1994 liability for postretirement  benefits
      in the amount of $16.2  million in  addition to prepaid  pension  costs of
      $2.5 million  related to Central  Telephone  Company of  Florida's  active
      employees and retirees.
      
      Defined Benefit Pension Plan
      ----------------------------

      Substantially   all   employees   of  the   Company   are   covered  by  a
      noncontributory  defined  benefit  pension plan  sponsored by Sprint.  For
      participants  of the plan  represented  by  collective  bargaining  units,
      benefits are based upon schedules of defined  amounts as negotiated by the
      respective parties. For participants not covered by collective  bargaining
      agreements, the plan provides pension benefits based upon years of service
      and participants' compensation.

      The Company's policy is to make  contributions to the plan each year equal
      to an actuarially determined amount consistent with applicable federal tax
      regulations.  The funding objective is to accumulate funds at a relatively
      stable rate over the  participants'  working  lives so that  benefits  are
      fully funded at  retirement.  As of December 31, 1995,  the plan's  assets
      consisted  principally of investments in corporate  equity  securities and
      U.S. government and corporate debt securities.

      Pension  costs or credits are  determined  for each  subsidiary  of Sprint
      based on a direct  calculation  of  service  costs and  projected  benefit
      obligations and an appropriate  allocation of  unrecognized  prior service
      costs,  transition  asset,  and plan assets.  Net periodic pension credits
      recorded by the Company for the years ended  December 31, 1995,  1994, and
      1993  were  $3,521,000,   $3,638,000  and  $8,431,000,   respectively.  In
      addition,  the Company recorded pension  curtailment  gains of $115,000 in
      1993 as a result of merger and integration actions (see Note 9).

3.    EMPLOYEE BENEFIT PLANS (continued)

      Defined Contribution Plans
      --------------------------

      Sprint  sponsors  defined  contribution  employee  savings plans  covering
      substantially  all employees of the Company.  Participants  may contribute
      portions of their compensation to the plans. Contributions of participants
      represented  by  collective  bargaining  units are  matched by the Company
      based  upon  defined  amounts as  negotiated  by the  respective  parties.
      Contributions  of  participants  not  covered  by  collective   bargaining
      agreements are also matched by the Company.  For these  participants,  the
      Company provides matching contributions in Sprint common stock equal to 50
      percent  of   participants'   contributions  up  to  6  percent  of  their
      compensation  and may, at the  discretion of Sprint's  Board of Directors,
      provide additional  matching  contributions  based upon the performance of
      Sprint's  common  stock price in  comparison  to other  telecommunications
      companies.  The Company's matching contributions  aggregated approximately
      $5,700,000,   $5,300,000   and   $3,800,000   in  1995,   1994  and  1993,
      respectively.


      Postretirement Benefits
      -----------------------

      Sprint sponsors postretirement benefits (principally health care benefits)
      arrangements   covering   substantially  all  employees  of  the  Company.
      Employees  who  retired  before  specified  dates are  eligible  for these
      benefits at reduced cost.  Employees  retiring after  specified  dates are
      eligible for these benefits on a shared cost basis.  The Company funds the
      accrued costs as benefits are paid.

       Net  postretirement  benefit costs are determined for each  subsidiary of
      Sprint  based on a direct  calculation  of service  costs and  accumulated
      postretirement  benefit  obligations  and  an  appropriate  allocation  of
      unrecognized  prior service costs,  unrecognized  net gains and transition
      obligation.  Net postretirement  benefit costs recorded by the Company for
      the  years  ended  December  31,  1995,  1994 and 1993  were  $17,420,000,
      $16,667,000  and  $14,640,000,  respectively.  In  addition,  the  Company
      recorded  postretirement benefit curtailment losses of $ 5,632,000 in 1993
      as a result of merger and integration actions (see Note 9).

      Postemployment Benefits
      -----------------------

      Effective  January 1, 1994, the Company adopted SFAS No. 112,  "Employers'
      Accounting  for  Postemployment  Benefits."  Upon  adoption,  the  Company
      recognized  certain previously  unrecorded  obligations for benefits being
      provided  to former or  inactive  employees  and their  dependents,  after
      employment   but  before   retirement.   The  resulting   charge  did  not
      significantly   impact   the   Company's   financial   statements.    Such
      postemployment   benefits  offered  by  the  Company  include   severance,
      disability and worker's compensation benefits,  including the continuation
      of other benefits such as health care and life insurance coverage.

4.    INCOME TAXES (continued)

      On August 10,  1993,  the Revenue  Reconciliation  Act of 1993 was enacted
      which,  among  other  changes,  raised  the  federal  income  tax rate for
      corporations  to 35 percent  from 34  percent,  retroactive  to January 1,
      1993.  The  resulting  adjustments  to the Company's  deferred  income tax
      assets  and  liabilities  to  reflect  the  revised  rate  were  generally
      reflected as reductions  to the related  regulatory  liabilities  and have
      been subsequently eliminated in connection with the Company's discontinued
      application of SFAS No. 71 (see Note 2).

      The differences which cause the effective income tax rate to vary from the
      statutory  federal  income tax rate of 35 percent in 1995,  1994, and 1993
      are as follows (in thousands):

      In  1995  an  income  tax  benefit  of $82  million  associated  with  the
      extraordinary  charge for the  discontinuation  of  regulatory  accounting
      principles was reflected as a reduction of such charge in the consolidated
      statement  of income.  In 1994 and 1993,  income tax benefits of $134,000,
      and $873,000,  respectively,  associated  with the  extraordinary  charges
      incurred  related to the early  extinguishments  of debt were reflected as
      reductions of such charges in the consolidated statements of income.

5.    LONG-TERM DEBT AND EXTRAORDINARY CHARGES ON EXTINGUISHMENTS (continued)


      The Company has  scheduled  long-term  debt  maturities of $2.0 million in
      1996. No maturities are scheduled during 1997 through 2000.

      The first mortgage bonds and notes are secured by substantially all of the
      Company's property, plant and equipment.

      As of  December  31,  1995,  the  Company  had lines of credit  with banks
      totaling $100 million of which $70.3  million was unused.  The bank lines,
      which  are  renewable  in May  and  June,  1996,  provide  for  short-term
      borrowings at market rates of interest and require annual  commitment fees
      based on the unused portion.  Lines of credit,  which support  outstanding
      commercial  paper,  may be  withdrawn  by the banks if there is a material
      adverse  change in the  financial  condition of the Company.  The weighted
      average interest rate on short-term  borrowings for 1995 and 1994 is 5.95%
      and 4.56%, respectively.

      The Company is in compliance with all  restrictive or financial  covenants
      relating to its debt arrangements at December 31, 1995.

      During 1995,  the Company  redeemed,  prior to scheduled  maturities,  its
      $633,000  Rural  Telephone  Bank 6.0 percent Note,  and its $126,000 Rural
      Utilities  Service  (formerly Rural  Electrification  Administration)  2.0
      percent  Note.  On January 15, 1995,  the Company  issued  Series HH 8.375
      percent  first  mortgage  bonds for $70  million  which was used to reduce
      short-term  debt.  During 1994, the Company  redeemed,  prior to scheduled
      maturities,  its Winter Park 6.50 percent  Series I Bonds for $2.5 million
      and a portion of its 9.25 percent  Series CC Bonds for $20.5 million which
      includes principal,  interest and redemption premiums.  Except for amounts
      deferred  as allowed by the FPSC,  the  prepayment  penalties  incurred in
      connection  with the  early  extinguishments  of debt and the write off of
      related  unamortized  issuance  costs,  net  of  the  related  income  tax
      benefits,  are  reflected  as  extraordinary  charges in the 1994 and 1993
      consolidated statements of income.

      As of December 31, 1994, $70 million of commercial paper was classified as
      long-term  debt due to the  Company's  January  1995  refinancing  of such
      borrowings on a long-term basis as noted above.

      and $8,543,000 in 1993. Minimum rental commitments as of December 31, 1995
      for non-cancelable operating leases are not significant.

      The Company's  planned capital  expenditures  for the year ending December
      31, 1996 are approximately $202,000,000.  Normal purchase commitments have
      been or will be made for these planned expenditures.

8     RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS

      The  Company  purchases  telecommunications  equipment,  construction  and
      maintenance  equipment,  materials and supplies from its affiliate,  North
      Supply Company.  Total purchases for 1995, 1994 and 1993 were $68,998,747,
      $72,060,000 and $67,889,000, respectively.

      Under an agreement with Sprint, the Company receives,  at cost, consulting

      are also allocated by Sprint to affiliated companies. Total charges to the
      Company aggregated $47,962,000, $39,742,000, and $45,369,000 in 1995, 1994

      eliminated  in 1994.  The  Company  reimburses  Sprint  for  certain  data
      processing  services and other data  related  costs which are incurred for
      the Company's  benefit.  Such charges,  which approximate the cost of such
      services as determined by Sprint, aggregated $26,273,000, $22,704,000, and
      $21,367,000 in 1995, 1994, and 1993, respectively.

      The Company  enters  into cash  advance and  borrowing  transactions  with
      Sprint;  generally,  interest  is  computed  based  on the  prior  month's
      thirty-day  average  commercial  paper index,  as published in the Federal
      Reserve Statistical Release H.15 plus 15 basis points. Interest expense on
      such advances from Sprint was $3,100,  $42,000,  and $46,000 in 1995, 1994
      and 1993,  respectively.  Interest  income on such  advances to Sprint was
      $414,000, 15,000, and $3,000 in 1995, 1994, and 1993, respectively.

      The  Company  provides  various  services  to Sprint,  such as  facilities
      rental,   postage,  house  services,   company  official  toll  and  other
      miscellaneous  items. The Company  received  $2,868,000,  $7,314,000,  and
      $11,625,000 in 1995, 1994, and 1993, respectively, for such services.

  8.  RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS (continued)

      Sprint Publishing & Advertising,  an affiliate, pays the Company a fee for
      the right to publish  telephone  directories  in the  Company's  operating
      territory,  a listing fee, and a fee for billing and  collection  services
      performed for Sprint  Publishing & Advertising  by the Company.  For 1995,
      1994 and 1993, Sprint Publishing & Advertising paid the Company a total of
      $53,946,000, $49,122,000, and $45,458,000,  respectively. The Company paid
      Sprint Publishing & Advertising $4,420,000,  $3,634,000, and $3,451,000 in
      1995, 1994, and 1993, respectively,  for its costs of publishing the white
      page portion of the directories.

      The  Company   provides   various   services  to  Sprint's  long  distance
      communications  services  division,  such as network access,  operator and
      billing and collection services, and the lease of network facilities.  The
      Company  received  $34,473,000,  $29,656,000 and $25,171,000 in 1995, 1994
      and 1993, respectively, for these services. The Company paid Sprint's long
      distance  communications services division $13,805,000,  $11,528,000,  and
      $13,863,000  in  1995,  1994 and  1993,  respectively,  for  interexchange
      telecommunication services.

      The Company is reimbursed by affiliated companies for certain salaries and
      other costs which are incurred by the Company for the affiliates' benefit.
      Also, the Company reimburses  affiliated companies for charges incurred by
      the  affiliates  for  the  Company's  benefit.  The  reimbursable  charges
      approximate  the cost of such items as  determined  by the Company and the
      affiliates.  Such amounts reimbursed to the Company, net of reimbursements
      paid,  aggregate  approximately $67 million, $64 million and $2 million in
      1995, 1994 and 1993, respectively.

      Certain  directors  and  officers  of the  Company  and  Sprint  are  also
      directors  or officers of banks at which the Company  conducts  borrowings
      and related  transactions.  The terms are  comparable  with other banks at
      which the Company has similar transactions.

9.    MERGER, INTEGRATION  AND RESTRUCTURING COSTS

      Sprint/Centel Merger
      --------------------

      Effective  March 9,  1993,  Sprint  consummated  its  merger  with  Centel
      Corporation (Centel), a telecommunications company with local exchange and
      cellular/wireless   communications  services  operations.  Centel's  local
      exchange  telephone  businesses  operate  in six  states:  Florida,  North
      Carolina, Virginia, Illinois, Texas, and Nevada. Pursuant to the Agreement
      and Plan of Merger  dated May 27, 1992,  Sprint  issued 1.37 shares of its
      common  stock in  exchange  for each  outstanding  share of Centel  common
      stock.  The  transaction  costs  associated  with the  merger  (consisting
      primarily  of  investment  banking  and legal  fees) and the  expenses  of
      integrating  and   restructuring  the  operations  of  the  two  companies
      (consisting  primarily of employee  severance and relocation  expenses and
      costs of  eliminating  duplicative  facilities)  resulted in  nonrecurring
      charges to Sprint during 1993. The portion of such charges attributable to
      the  Company  was  $51   million,   which   reduced  1993  net  income  by
      approximately $31 million.

10.   ADDITIONAL FINANCIAL INFORMATION

      Realignment and Restructuring Charge
      ------------------------------------

      During 1995, Sprint initiated a realignment and restructuring of its local
      communications   services   division,   including   the   elimination   of
      approximately 250 of the Company's positions.  These actions resulted in a
      nonrecurring  charge to the Company of $12.2  million,  which  reduced net
      income by $7.5 million.  The accrued liability associated with this charge
      specifically  relates to the benefits that affected employees will receive
      upon termination.

      Major Customer Information
      --------------------------

      Consolidated  operating revenues from AT&T Corp.  resulting primarily from
      network access,  billing and collection services, and the lease of network
      facilities  aggregated  approximately $162 million,  $172 million and $167
      million for 1995, 1994 and 1993, respectively.

      The Company's  customer and other  accounts  receivable are not subject to
      significant  concentration  of  credit  risk due to the  large  number  of
      customers in the Company's customer base.

      The principal  industries in the Company's service area include the retail
      trade and service industries.

      Financial Instruments Information
      ---------------------------------

      The Company  estimates the fair value of its financial  instruments  using
      available  market  information  and appropriate  valuation  methodologies.
      Accordingly, the estimates presented herein are not necessarily indicative
      of the values the  Company  could  realize in a current  market  exchange.
      Although  management  is not aware of any  factors  that would  affect the
      estimated  fair value  amounts  presented as of December  31,  1995,  such
      amounts  have not been  comprehensively  revalued  for  purposes  of these
      financial  statements  since that date, and  therefore,  estimates of fair
      value  subsequent to that date may differ  significantly  from the amounts
      presented herein.

      The Company's financial  instruments  primarily consist of long-term debt,
      including  current  maturities,  with carrying  amounts as of December 31,
      1995  and  1994  of  $504,745,000  and  $443,962,000,   respectively,  and
      estimated fair values of $468,627,000 and $471,956,000,  respectively. The
      fair   values   are   estimated   based  on  quoted   market   prices  for
      publicly-traded issues, and based on the present value of estimated future
      cash flows using a discount rate  commensurate with the risks involved for
      all other issues.

      The  carrying  values  of  the  Company's   other  financial   instruments
      (principally  short-term borrowings) approximate fair value as of December
      31, 1995 and 1994.

      The Company has not invested in derivative financial instruments.

       Corporation a bond of indemnity,  with one or more sureties  satisfactory
       to the Board of Directors,  in at least double the par value of the stock
       represented by the certificate claimed to be lost or destroyed, whereupon
       a new certificate may be issued of the same tenor and for the same number
       of shares as the one alleged to be lost or destroyed,  but always subject
       to the approval of the Board of Directors.

                                  STOCK RECORD

65.   A stock  ledger  shall be  maintained  showing  a record  of the stock
       holding of each stockholder.

                                 CORPORATE SEAL

66.  The corporate seal shall have  inscribed  thereon:  "United  Telephone
      Company of Florida, a Florida Corporation. Corporate Seal."

                                   AMENDMENTS

67.    The Articles of Incorporation,  Article VI, provides that "The bylaws may
       be adopted or amended  only by a majority of all the voting  stock voting
       in person or by proxy".

                                      3b-9
<PAGE>

68.    Any stockholder or group of stockholders of record can propose amendments
       to the Bylaws or the Articles of  Incorporation by a notice in writing to
       the Secretary, outlining in sufficient detail such proposed amendments to
       be considered at any annual meeting of the stockholders. Such notice must
       be  sufficiently in advance of the annual meeting and in the hands of the
       Secretary in time to comply with  Sections Four and Seven of these bylaws
       entitled "Notice of Meetings of Stockholders."

69.    Stockholders  representing  twenty-five  percent of the total outstanding
       stock  entitled to vote can propose  amendments to the Bylaws or Articles
       of  Incorporation  by a notice in writing to the  Secretary  outlining in
       sufficient detail such proposed amendments and the request that a special
       meeting of the  stockholders  be called in accordance with Section Two of
       these Bylaws, entitled "Meetings of Stockholders."

70.    Any  proposals   for   amendments  to  the  Bylaws  or  the  Articles  of
       Incorporation  can be recommended by any elected or appointed  officer or
       the Executive Committee, but must have approval of the Board of Directors
       before being  recommended by the management of the Company as a group for
       consideration at any annual or special meeting of the  stockholders.  Any
       officer  who is also a  stockholder,  however,  shall have the right as a
       stockholder,   to  propose  amendments  to  the  Bylaws  or  Articles  of
       Incorporation  at any  annual  meeting  of the  stockholders  so  long as
       Section 68 under this heading is complied with.

71.    In no event  shall  any  amendment  or  amendments  to the  Bylaws or the
       Articles of  Incorporation  be  considered  valid unless proper notice of
       such amendment or amendments is given to  stockholders  in advance of any
       annual or special meeting in compliance with Sections 4, 7, 68, 69 and 70
       of these Bylaws.

72.    That whenever in these Bylaws the word "stockholder" or "stockholders" is
       used,  it shall be  construed to mean only the holder or holders of stock
       entitled to vote pursuant to the  Certificate of  Incorporation,  except,
       however,  as used in Bylaw Number 65 pertaining to the  maintenance  of a
       stock  ledger;  and wherever in these Bylaws the word "stock" is used, it
       shall be construed to mean stock possessing  voting power pursuant to the
       Certificate of Incorporation,  except, however, as used in Bylaws Numbers
       39, 61, 62, 63, 64 and 65  pertaining  generally to the issuance of stock
       certificates and maintenance of stock records.

73.     Indemnification of Officer and Directors.

       (a)    Limitation of Liability.

              No  person  shall be  liable  to the  Corporation  for any loss or
              damage suffered by it on account of any action taken or omitted to
              be taken by him or her as a director or officer of the Corporation
              in good  faith,  if such  person  (1)  exercised  or used the same
              degree  of care and  skill as a prudent  man or woman  would  have
              exercised or used under the circumstances in the conduct of his or
              her own  affairs,  or (2) took or omitted  to take such  action in
              reliance  on  advice  of  counsel  for  the  Corporation  or  upon
              statements made or information  furnished by officers or employees
              of the  Corporation  which  he or she had  reasonable  grounds  to
              believe.

       (b)    Indemnification

              (1)   Actions  Other  Than  Those  by  or  in  the  Right  of  the
                    Corporation.  The Corporation shall indemnify any person who
                    was or is a party or is threatened to be made a party to any
                    threatened, pending or completed action, suit or proceeding,
                    whether civil,  criminal,  administrative  or  investigative
                    (other than an action by or in the right of the Corporation)
                    by reason of the fact that he or she is or was a director or
                    officer  of the  Corporation,  or is or was  serving  at the
                    request  of the  Corporation  as a  director  or  officer of
                    another corporation,  partnership,  joint venture,  trust or
                    other  enterprise,  against expenses  (including  attorneys'
                    fees),  judgments,  fines  and  amounts  paid in  settlement
                    actually and reasonably incurred by him or her in connection
                    with such action,  suit or  proceeding if he or she acted in
                    good faith and in a manner he or she reasonably  believed to
                    be  in  or  not  opposed  to  the  best   interests  of  the
                    Corporation  (or such other  corporation  or  organization),
                    and, with respect to any criminal action or proceeding,  had
                    no  reasonable  cause  to  believe  his or her  conduct  was
                    unlawful.  The termination of any action, suit or proceeding
                    by judgment,  order, settlement,  conviction, or upon a plea
                    of nolo contendre or its  equivalent,  shall not, of itself,
                    create a  presumption  that the  person  did not act in good
                    faith and in a manner which he or she reasonably believed to
                    be  in  or  not  opposed  to  the  best   interests  of  the
                    Corporation,  and,  with respect to any  criminal  action or
                    proceeding,  had reasonable cause to believe that his or her
                    conduct was unlawful.

                    (2)  Action  by or in  the  Right  of the  Corporation.  The
                    Corporation shall indemnify any person who was or is a party
                    or is  threatened  to be  made a  party  to any  threatened,
                    pending  or  completed  action or suit by or in the right of
                    the Corporation to procure a judgment in its favor by reason
                    of the fact that he or she is or was a director  or officer,
                    of the  Corporation,  or is or was serving at the request of
                    the   Corporation  as  a  director  or  officer  of  another
                    corporation,  partnership,  joint  venture,  trust  or other
                    enterprise  against  expenses  (including  attorneys'  fees)
                    actually and reasonably incurred by him or her in connection
                    with the defense or  settlement of such action or suit if he
                    or  she  acted  in  good  faith  and in a  manner  he or she
                    reasonably  believed  to be in or not  opposed  to the  best
                    interests of the Corporation  (or such other  corporation or
                    organization)  and except that no  indemnification  shall be
                    made in respect  of any  claim,  issue or matter as to which
                    such  person  shall  have been  adjudged  to be  liable  for
                    negligence or misconduct  in the  performance  of his or her
                    duty  to the  Corporation  (or  such  other  corporation  or
                    organization)  unless and only to the extent  that the court
                    in which such  action or suit was  brought  shall  determine
                    upon application that, despite the adjudication of liability
                    but in view  of all  the  circumstances  of the  case,  such
                    person is fairly and  reasonably  entitled to indemnity  for
                    such expenses which such court shall deem proper.

              (3)   Successful Defense of Action.  Notwithstanding,  and without
                    limitation  of, any other  provision  of this Section 73, to
                    the extent that a director or officer of the Corporation has
                    been successful on the merits or otherwise in defense of any
                    action,  suit or proceeding  referred to in paragraph (1) or
                    (2) of this Section 73, or in defense of any claim, issue or
                    matter  therein,  he or she  shall  be  indemnified  against
                    expenses (including attorneys' fees) actually and reasonably
                    incurred by him or her in connection therewith.

              (4)   Determination  Required. Any indemnification under paragraph
                    (1) or (2) of this  Section 73  (unless  ordered by a court)
                    shall be made by the  Corporation  only as authorized in the
                    specific case upon a determination  that  indemnification of
                    the  director  or  officer  is proper  in the  circumstances
                    because he or she has met the applicable standard of conduct
                    set forth in said  paragraph.  Such  determination  shall be
                    made (i) by the Board of Directors  by a majority  vote of a
                    quorum  consisting  of directors who were not parties to the
                    particular action,  suit or proceeding,  or (ii) if a quorum
                    is not  obtainable,  or,  even if  obtainable  a  quorum  of
                    disinterested  directors so directs,  by  independent  legal
                    counsel in a written opinion, or (iii) by the stockholders.

                                     3b-12
<PAGE>

              (5)   Advance of Expenses.  Expenses incurred in defending a civil
                    or criminal  action,  suit or proceeding  may be paid by the
                    Corporation  in  advance  of the final  disposition  of such
                    action,  suit or proceeding as authorized may be paid by the
                    Corporation  in  advance  of the final  disposition  of such
                    action,  suit or  proceeding  as  authorized by the Board of
                    Directors   in  the   specific   case  upon   receipt  of  a
                    satisfactory  undertaking by or on behalf of the director or
                    officer to repay such amount  unless it shall  ultimately be
                    determined  that he or she is entitled to be  indemnified by
                    the Corporation as authorized in this Section 73.

       (c)    Nonexclusivity; Duration.

              The   indemnifications,   rights,  and  limitations  of  liability
              provided by this  Section 73 shall not be deemed  exclusive of any
              other  indemnifications,  rights or  limitations  of  liability to
              which any person may be entitled under any bylaw, agreement,  vote
              of stockholders or disinterested  directors, or otherwise,  either
              as to action in his  official  capacity or as to action in another
              capacity while holding  office,  and they shall continue  although
              such person has ceased to be a director or officer and shall inure
              to the benefit of his or her heirs, executors and administrators.
