     of nonrecurring merger and integration costs related to Sprint/Centel merger, income

     fixed charges would have been 5.40 for the twelve month period ended December 31, 1993.  
             

NOTE: The above ratios have been computed by dividing fixed charges into the sum of (a) income 
before extraordinary item less capitalized interest included in income,  (b) income taxes, and 
(c) fixed charges.  Fixed charges consist of interest on all indebtedness (including amortization 
of debt issuance expenses) and the related interest factor of operating rents.
