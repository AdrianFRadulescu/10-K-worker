Item 1.   Business
          --------
United Telephone Company of Florida (the Company) is a subsidiary of Sprint
Corporation (Sprint).  The  principal executive offices of the  Company are
located at 555 Lake Border Drive, Apopka, Florida  32703.

The Company  was  formed  as the result of a combination effective December
31, 1982,  pursuant to  an  Agreement  and  Plan  of  Merger, in  which the
Company's affiliates,  the former United Telephone Company  of Florida, The
Winter  Park  Telephone   Company  and  Orange   City  Telephone   Company,
Incorporated  were merged into Florida Telephone Corporation (FTC).  As the
surviving corporation, FTC, which  had been incorporated under the  laws of
the  State of  Florida  on  September 29,  1925,  amended  its articles  of
incorporation to provide for a change of corporate name to United Telephone
Company of Florida.

The  Company  is  engaged  in  the  business  of  furnishing  communication
services,  principally local,  network access  and long  distance services,
serving  approximately 1,134,000  customers in  all or  part of  24 Florida
counties,  comprising some  30  percent of  the  state's total  area.   The
Company's  current estimate of population  within its service  areas is 2.4
million as  compared to census counts of approximately 1.8 million in 1990,
1.0 million in 1980 and 600,000 in 1970.  

The Company  had 6,005 employees  at December 31,  1994, of which  2,727 or
45.4  percent  are  represented  by either  the  Communications  Workers of
America  or  the  International  Brotherhood  of  Electrical  Workers   for
collective  bargaining  purposes.    Of  the  6,005  employees,  1,418  are
dedicated to  serving Central Telephone  Company of Florida,  an affiliated
company which reimburses the Company for the related employee costs.

In  addition to furnishing local service, the Company's central offices and
toll  lines are  connected  with other  telephone  companies and  with  the
nationwide toll networks of interexchange carriers (IXCs) for the provision
of message toll service and  other long distance services.  Toll  calls may
thus  be made  to  any  telephone  in  the United  States  and  most  other
countries.   Other telecommunications services, for the most part furnished
in  conjunction  with other  telephone  companies,  include facilities  for
private line service, data transmission and wide area toll service (WATS). 

Revenues from  communication  services  constituted  86.1  percent  of  the
operating revenues of the Company in 1994.  The remaining  13.9 percent was
derived  largely from  directory  operations,  equipment sales,  facilities
leases and billing and collection services provided to IXCs.  A significant
portion of the  Company's network  access revenue is  derived from  network
access  billings to  AT&T  Corp. (AT&T).   However,  the  Company does  not
believe  its revenues  are dependent  upon AT&T,  as customers'  demand for
interLATA long  distance telephone  service  is not  tied to  any one  long
distance  carrier.  As the market share of AT&T's long distance competitors
increases, the  percent of  revenues derived from  network access  services
provided to AT&T decreases.

During the five years ended December 31, 1994, the compounded annual growth
rate in access lines served was 5.1 percent.

  1991     849       263      1,112    4.3        4,360,713         6.6
  1990     819       247      1,066    6.0        4,089,885        12.3

In  1987 the Company formed United Telephone  Long Distance, Inc. (UTLD), a
Florida  corporation, and  in 1988  the Florida  Public Service  Commission
(FPSC)  granted  UTLD's  request  for  certification  as  an  interexchange
carrier.   UTLD resells WATS service as interLATA message telephone service
from exchanges within the Company's service area.  

Effective  January 1,  1991,  the Federal  Communications Commission  (FCC)
adopted a price cap regulatory format for  the Bell Operating Companies and
the  GTE local exchange companies.   Other local  exchange companies (LECs)
could volunteer to become subject to the price cap regulation.  Under price
caps,  prices for  access  service must  be  adjusted annually  to  reflect
industry  average productivity gains  (as specified by  the FCC), inflation
and certain allowed  cost changes.   The Company elected  to be subject  to
price cap regulation,  and under the form of the  plan adopted, the Company
has an  opportunity  to earn  up  to a  15.25  percent rate  of  return  on
investment on its interstate operations.  The FCC is conducting a scheduled
review of all aspects of  the price cap plan  and is expected to  implement
changes  in 1995.  Without further action by the FCC, the current price cap
plan will expire in 1995 and will be replaced by rate of return regulation.
It is expected that the FCC will act and that there will not be a return to
rate of return regulation.  

In June 1994, the Company entered  into a stipulation with the FPSC whereby
the Company's intrastate  rates were reduced by $17.6 million  on an annual
basis beginning  July  1, 1994.   Approximately  $9.9 million  of the  rate
reduction was  in intrastate access elements and  was intended to bring the
intrastate  access rates more in line with interstate rates.  Approximately
$5.0 million  of the rate reduction  was in intraLATA toll  rates, and $2.7
million  in local  service revenue.   In  addition, the  Company agreed  to
record additional  depreciation of $2.8 million  ($2.1 million intrastate),
which  was recognized  in  the  second  quarter.    The  Company's  allowed
intrastate return  on equity was capped  at 13.0 percent for  1994 with any
earnings in  excess of  13.0 percent  to be deferred  to 1995  when, absent
further commission action, the upper range of the allowed return reverts to
13.5 percent.

Item 1.   Business (continued)                                
          --------------------

In  November 1994, in compliance  with FPSC regulations,  the Company filed
its triennial depreciation study seeking an increase in annual depreciation
expense of approximately $16.3 million effective January 1,  1995.  In this
filing the Company  sought shorter service lives to  recognize obsolescence
caused  by emerging technologies required to meet customer demands for more
sophisticated voice  and data  facilities.  On  January 17, 1995,  the FPSC
allowed  the Company  to implement,  on a  preliminary basis,  the proposed
rates,  reduced by  a one-time  depreciation charge  of $3.2  million ($2.4
million  intrastate) to  be  recorded in  1994, which  served to  bring the
Company's 1994 intrastate return on equity below the 13.0 percent cap noted
above.  On March 1, 1995, the Office of Public Counsel filed a petition for
a hearing in protest of the  FPSC's approval of the early implementation of
the  depreciation rates.    A final  ruling on  depreciation  rates is  not
expected until late 1995 or early 1996.   

On  December 1,  1994,  the FPSC  approved  the Company's  proposal,  filed
November 2, 1994,  for additional rate reductions with an effective date of
January 1, 1995.   The total proposed revenue reduction  is projected to be
$10.6  million in 1995,  $9 million of  which is in  switched access charge
reductions and the  remainder in cellular  interconnection usage rates  and
intraLATA toll rates.     

The potential for more  direct competition with the Company  is increasing.
Many states, including Florida, allow  competitive entry into the intraLATA
long-distance  service  market.   State  regulators  are also  increasingly
confronted  with requests to permit resale of local exchange services, with
such resale now existing  in a number of states in which  other Sprint LECs
offer  local  communications  services,  including   Pennsylvania,  Kansas,
Illinois and Missouri.

At the interstate level, the FCC has revised its rules to permit connection
of  customer-owned coin telephones to  the local network,  exposing LECs to
direct  coin telephone  competition.   Additionally, the  FCC has  assisted
Competitive Access  Providers (CAPs)  in providing access  to interexchange
carriers and end  users by mandating  that all Tier  1 LECs, including  the
Company,  allow virtual colocation of CAP equipment in LEC central offices.

The extent  and ultimate  impact of competition  for LECs will  continue to
depend,  to a  considerable degree,  on FCC  and state  regulatory actions,
court decisions  and possible  federal and  state legislation. The  Clinton
Administration has  indicated that  it supports legislation  which promotes
local  telephone competition.    Although federal  legislation designed  to
stimulate local  competition between  local exchange service  providers and
cable  programming service  providers in  both markets has  been introduced
several  times in recent years,  bills have yet to  be reported out of both
the House of Representatives and the Senate in a session.   Legislation has
been introduced in  Congress in 1995.   While both major  political parties
are  predicting that legislation will be passed, such predictions have been
proven to be inaccurate in the recent past.

Item 1.  Business (continued) 
         --------------------
The  Company's environmental  compliance and  remediation expenditures  are
primarily  related to  the operation  of standby  power generators  for its
telecommunications equipment.   The  expenditures arise in  connection with
permits,  standards  compliance or  occasional  remediation,  which may  be
associated with generators,  batteries or  fuel storage.   The Company  has
been  designated  a potentially  responsible party  at  a site  relating to
landfill   contamination.     The   Company's  expenditures   relating   to
environmental compliance  and remediation  have  not been  material to  the
financial  statements or  to  the operations  of  the Company  and are  not
expected to have any future material effects.

Item 2.   Properties
          ----------
The  properties of  the Company  consist principally  of  land, structures,
facilities and  equipment.   Substantially all  of the  telephone property,
plant and  equipment is subject to the liens of the indentures securing the
Company's  first mortgage debt.   Of the Company's  investment in telephone
plant  in service  as  of  December 31,  1994,  cable  and wire  facilities
represented  approximately   50  percent  of  the   total;  central  office
equipment, 37 percent; land and buildings, 6 percent; telephone instruments
and certain related equipment installed on subscriber premises,  2 percent;
and, other telephone plant, 5 percent.

Item 7.   Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and  
          Results of Operations

The Company's  financial well-being plays  a vital  role in its  efforts to
provide  efficient, responsive, state-of-the-art  communication services to
the  rapidly growing  Florida  market  amid  the uncertainties  created  by
potential deregulation.  In  order to meet  the challenges of this  dynamic
environment, the Company continues  to seek ways to speed  capital recovery
and  increase  organizational   efficiency  through   careful  control   of
construction expenditures,  increased depreciation  of telephone plant  and
automation and consolidation of functions.  Concurrently, efforts have been
undertaken to  aggressively implement new technologies,  including enhanced
digital switching, fiber optics  and pair gain devices that  offer expanded
services at reduced costs.  

Sprint/Centel Merger
--------------------

Effective  March  9,  1993,  Sprint  consummated  its  merger  with  Centel
Corporation, a telecommunications company with local exchange and  cellular
and wireless communications  services operations  (see Note 9  of Notes  to
Consolidated  Financial  Statements  for   additional  information).    The
transaction  costs  associated with  the  merger  (consisting primarily  of
investment  banking  and  legal  fees)   and  the  estimated  expenses   of
integrating  and   restructuring  the  operations  of   the  two  companies
(consisting  primarily of  employee severance  and relocation  expenses and
costs  of eliminating  duplicative facilities)  resulted in  a nonrecurring
charge  to Sprint during 1993.  The  portion of such charge attributable to
the Company was $51 million, which reduced 1993 net income by approximately
$31 million. 

Liquidity and Capital Resources
-------------------------------
The ability to generate cash from operations is a good measure of liquidity
for  the  Company.   The Company  does not  require  large sums  of working
capital because cash  inflows are relatively stable due to the stability in
demand for telephone services.  

As  detailed in the Consolidated Statements  of Cash Flows, the Company had
net cash provided by its operating activities of $294 million, $254 million
and  $262 million in  1994, 1993 and  1992, respectively.   The increase in
operating  cash flows in 1994 is primarily  due to an increase in operating
income  adjusted  for  depreciation as  well  as  an  increase in  accounts
payable, partially offset by an increase in accounts receivable. 

The  Company has  large  capital  requirements  because  of  its  need  for
substantial amounts  of  plant  and  equipment  to  provide  communications
services to customers.  The Company's planned construction expenditures for
modernization and growth in  1995 are approximately $182 million,  of which
$79 million is for central office equipment, $78 million for cable and wire
facilities, $17 million for general support assets and $8 million for other
telecommunications assets.  Actual  expenditures were $178 million in  1994
and $185 million in both 1993 and 1992.

Liquidity and Capital Resources (continued)   
-------------------------------------------

Because the Company is  capital intensive, external financing is  sometimes
required to  supplement cash provided by operations.  The primary source of
external  financing has  been through the  issuance of  debt.    During the
year,  the Company redeemed, prior  to scheduled maturity,  $2.5 million of
its Winter Park 6.50 percent Series I  Bonds, and $20.5 million of its 9.25
percent Series  CC Bonds.  The  Company issued $70 million  of 8.38 percent
Series HH bonds on January 15, 1995.  Long-term debt is further detailed in
Note 4 of Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements.      

The  average short-term debt outstanding  was $39 million  during 1994, $35
million  during 1993  and  $20  million  during  1992.    Short-term  debt,
consisting  primarily  of  commercial  paper  and  advances  from   Sprint,
decreased by $27 million in 1994 and  increased $16 million in 1993 and $29
million in  1992.  The decrease in short-term debt  in 1994 resulted from a
reclassification  of a portion of the balance  to long-term debt due to the
issuance in January 1995 of Series HH 8.38 percent First Mortgage Bonds for
$70 million.   The proceeds of this issuance were used to reduce short-term
debt (see Note 4 of Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements).  
  
The Company anticipates that substantially all of the cash required in 1995
for its construction  program, principal  payments and  retirement of  long
term debt, and  preferred stock  redemption will be  provided by  operating
activities.  If  additional funds are required during  1995, it is expected
that they will be raised through the issuance of commercial  paper and bank
borrowings.  The  Company  maintains   bank  lines  of  credit   sufficient
to    support  outstanding  commercial   paper  and  bank  borrowings   and
anticipates  no   difficulty  in   meeting  potential   external  financing
requirements in this  manner during 1995.  The Company  had lines of credit
totaling  $120 million  at December  31, 1994, of  which $10.2  million was
unused.   As  a result  of the  $70  million issuance  of Series  HH  First
Mortgage Bonds and the  resulting decrease in short-term debt,  on February
9, 1995, the Company's lines of credit were reduced to $105 million.
  
At year end, the Company's ratio of common equity to total capital was 58.8
percent in  1994 and 60.8  percent in  both 1993  and 1992.   The ratio  of
short-term debt  to total capital was  3.4 percent in 1994,  5.7 percent in
1993 and 4.5 percent in 1992.

Item 7.   Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and  
          Results of Operations (continued) 


Financial Condition
-------------------

The Company's consolidated assets totaled $1.7 billion at December 31, 1994
compared  to  $1.6  billion at  December  31,  1993.   Accounts  receivable
increased  $29.9  million  as of  December  31,  1994 generally  due  to an
increase in consolidated  net operating  revenues and the  timing of  sales
activities and cash  collections.   Property, plant and  equipment, net  of
accumulated depreciation, increased $9.6  million from 1993 to 1994  due to
increased  capital  expenditures  to  enhance  and  upgrade  the  Company's
network,  to   expand  service  capabilities  and   increase  productivity.
Accounts payable increased $45.5 million from 1993 to 1994 primarily due to
an increase in  operating expenses  and the timing  of cash  disbursements.
Long-term  debt  increased  $48.0  million  from  1993  to  1994  primarily
resulting  from reclassification of a  portion of short-term  debt to long-
term due  to the January  1995 issuance of  Series HH First  Mortgage Bonds
(see  Note  4  of  Notes  to  the  Consolidated  Financial  Statements  for
additional information).  Postretirement and other benefit obligations  in- 
creased  $29.1  million from 1993 to 1004, of which $18.7 million is due to 
the  Company's  assumption  of  Central  Telephone  Company   of  Florida's, 
an affiliate Company postretirement benefits obligation (see Note 2 to the 
Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information).

Results of Operations
---------------------

Local service  revenues  are  derived  from  providing  telephone  exchange
services.  Local service revenues increased  in 1994 and 1993 primarily due
to increases in basic  area service revenues reflecting access  line growth
of  approximately  67,000  or  5.5  percent  and  62,000  or  5.3  percent,
respectively.   Also contributing  to the increases  in both 1994  and 1993
were increases in revenue  for custom calling features, Centrex  and Touch-
Tone  services.  Inside wire maintenance revenue increased due to increased
rates effective July 1, 1994, and  telephone lease revenue increased due to
higher customer demand.     

Network access service revenues are derived from billing other carriers and
telephone customers  for their  use of the  local network to  complete long
distance  calls in  those  instances where  long  distance service  is  not
provided  entirely  by  the  Company.    Network  access  service  revenues
increased $11.4 million in 1994 compared to 1993 primarily due to increased
minutes of use and customer activity net of rate reductions which went into
effect July 1,  1994. Network  access revenues decreased  slightly in  1993
compared to 1992 due to decreases in transitional support payments received
from  the National  Exchange Carrier  Association and  decreased interstate
rates.

Long distance service revenues are derived principally from  providing long
distance  services within  designated areas.    Revenues decreased  in 1994
primarily due to  rate reductions effective July 1, 1994  and the Company's
exit  from the intraLATA  toll private  line pool in  June 1993.   The 1993
decrease in long distance service revenues is due to  lower message volumes
over 1992 as well as reduced toll private line revenue  associated with the
Company's exit from the pool.

          Results of Operations (continued)


Results of Operations (continued)
---------------------------------

Miscellaneous  revenues include  revenues related  to directory  publishing
fees, providing billing  and collection services and  operator services for
interexchange carriers, sales  of telecommunications equipment and  leasing
of network facilities.   Miscellaneous revenues increased in 1994  and 1993
primarily due to an increase in directory revenues  and increases in demand
for   PBX,  key   systems,  data   equipment,  messageline   and  telephone
instruments.  

Plant  expense increased  in 1994  primarily due  to increased  access line
movement and  increased repairs of  cable and wire and building maintenance
required as a result of inclement weather.  In 1993 plant expense decreased
primarily due  to reduced central office  SS7/ExpressTouch related expenses
compared to the level of such costs in 1992.    

Depreciation  expense increased  $19 million  for  the twelve  months ended
December  31, 1994 due in part to  asset base growth between 1993 and 1994.
Also contributing  to this increase  were one-time depreciation  charges in
the amount  of $6.0 million approved by the FPSC during 1994.  Depreciation
expense decreased in 1993  primarily due to a change  in depreciation rates
which went into effect on July 1, 1992.

Customer operations expense  increased in  1994 and 1993  primarily due  to
increases in sales  salaries, commissions and  related expenses  associated
with the marketing of new products and services.

Corporate  operations expense increased in  1994 and 1993  primarily due to
increases  in the cost of information management systems. Increases in 1993
are also attributed to increases in advertising. 

Other  operating expenses increased in  1994 and 1993  primarily due to the
cost of goods related  to equipment sales due to a higher  demand for PBXs,
key systems, and telephone instruments. 

Nonoperating Items
------------------

The decrease in interest charges in 1994 and 1993 was primarily due to  the
lower interest rate on long term debt that was refinanced during 1994, 1993
and 1992.

The   Company  incurred   extraordinary  charges   related  to   the  early
extinguishments  of debt of $215,000, $1.4 million and $1.5 million, net of
related income tax benefits, in 1994, 1993, and 1992, respectively.

Effects of Inflation

The  effects  of inflation  on  the  operations  of the  Company  were  not
significant during 1994, 1993 or 1992.

Item 7.   Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and  
          Results of Operations (continued)


Accounting Developments
-----------------------

Effective  Janaury 1,  1994,  the Company  adopted  Statement of  Financial
Accounting   Standards   (SFAS)  No.   112,   "Employers'  Accounting   for
Postemployment Benefits" (see  Note 2  of Notes  to Consolidated  Financial
Statements for additional information).

Consistent  with most local exchange carriers, the Company accounts for the
economic effects of regulation pursuant to SFAS No. 71, "Accounting for the
Effects of  Certain Types of Regulation".   The application of  SFAS No. 71
requires the accounting recognition of the rate actions of regulators where
appropriate, including  the recognition of depreciation  based on estimated
useful lives prescribed  by regulatory commissions rather  than those which
might  be  utilized by  non-regulated enterprises.   The  Company currently
believes  its operations meet the criteria for the continued application of
the provisions  of  SFAS No.  71.   However,  the  Company operates  in  an
evolving  environment in which the regulatory framework is changing and the
level  and types of competition  are increasing.   Accordingly, the Company
constantly  monitors and evaluates the ongoing applicability of SFAS No. 71
by assessing the likelihood  that prices which provide for  the recovery of
specific costs can continue to be charged to customers.

In the event the  Company determines that its operations no  longer qualify
for the  application of the  provisions of SFAS  No. 71, the  Company would
eliminate  from  its financial  statements the  effects  of any  actions of
regulators  that  had  been  recognized  as  assets  and  liabilities.  The
resulting material,  noncash charge would  be recorded as  an extraordinary
item. (See Note  7  of Notes to  Consolidated Financial Statements for
information  regarding  the primary  components  and  estimated amounts  of
regulatory assets and liabilities as of December 31, 1994.)

                       REPORT OF INDEPENDENT AUDITORS



The Board of Directors
United Telephone Company of Florida



We  have audited  the  accompanying consolidated  balance sheets  of United
Telephone  Company   of  Florida,  a  wholly-owned   subsidiary  of  Sprint
Corporation, as of December 31, 1994 and 1993, and the related consolidated
statements of  income, retained earnings,  and cash flows  for each of  the
three years  in  the period  ended  December 31,  1994.   Our  audits  also
included  the  financial statement  schedule listed  in  the Index  at Item
14(a)2.  These financial statements and the schedule are the responsibility
of  the Company's management.  Our  responsibility is to express an opinion
on these financial statements and the schedule based on our audits.

We  conducted our  audits in  accordance  with generally  accepted auditing
standards.   Those standards require that we  plan and perform the audit to
obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free
of material misstatement.   An audit  includes examining, on a  test basis,
evidence  supporting  the   amounts  and  disclosures   in  the   financial
statements.   An  audit also  includes assessing the  accounting principles
used  and significant estimates made  by management, as  well as evaluating
the overall financial statement  presentation.  We believe that  our audits
provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.

In  our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present fairly,
in all  material respects,  the consolidated  financial position  of United
Telephone  Company of  Florida  at  December 31,  1994  and  1993, and  the
consolidated  results of its operations and its  cash flows for each of the
three years  in the  period  ended December  31, 1994,  in conformity  with
generally  accepted  accounting principles.    Also,  in our  opinion,  the
related financial statement  schedule, when considered  in relation to  the
basic  financial  statements  taken as  a  whole,  presents  fairly in  all
material respects the information set forth therein.

As discussed in  Note 2  to the consolidated  financial statements,  United
Telephone  Company  of  Florida  changed  its  method   of  accounting  for
postretirement benefits in 1993.

1.  SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

This summary of significant accounting policies of United Telephone Company
of  Florida  is  presented  to  assist  in  understanding the  accompanying
consolidated financial statements.   The consolidated financial  statements
and notes are representations of management, which is responsible for their
integrity  and  objectivity.     These  accounting  policies  conform  with
generally accepted accounting principles and reflect practices  appropriate
to the industry in which United Telephone Company of Florida operates.
                       
Basis of Presentation
---------------------
The accompanying consolidated financial  statements include the accounts of
United Telephone Company of Florida and its wholly-owned subsidiary, United
Telephone  Long Distance, Inc., collectively  referred to as the "Company."
All significant intercompany transactions have been eliminated. The Company
is a  wholly-owned subsidiary of Sprint  Corporation (Sprint); accordingly,
earnings per share information has been omitted.

Certain amounts  in the accompanying consolidated  financial statements for
1993 and  1992 have been  reclassified to  conform to  the presentation  of
amounts in the 1994 consolidated financial statements. These
reclassifications had no effect on net income in either year.

Operations
----------
The company is engaged in the business of providing communication services,
principally local,  network access and  long distance services  in Florida.
The Company accounts  for the  economic effects of  regulation pursuant  to
Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS)  No. 71, "Accounting for
the Effects of Certain  Types of Regulation" which requires  the accounting
recognition  of the  rate actions  of regulators  where appropriate.   Such
actions  can provide  reasonable assurance  of the  existence of  an asset,
reduce or  eliminate the  value of  an asset,  or impose  a liability on  a
regulated enterprise.

Cash
----
As part of  its cash  management program, the  Company utilizes  controlled
disbursement banking  arrangements.  Outstanding  checks in excess  of cash
balances are  reflected as a current  liability on the balance  sheet.  The
company had  sufficient funds  available to  fund these outstanding  checks
when they were presented for payment.

1.  SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (continued)


Inventories
-----------
Inventories  consist of materials and  supplies stated at  average cost and
equipment held  for resale stated at  the lower of average  cost or market.
The sales inventory balances were  $11,494,000 and $11,379,000 at  December
31, 1994 and 1993, respectively.

Property, Plant and Equipment
-----------------------------
Property,  plant  and  equipment are  recorded  at  cost.   Retirements  of
depreciable property  are charged against accumulated  depreciation with no
gain or loss  recognized.  Repairs  and maintenance costs  are expensed  as
incurred.

Depreciation
------------
Depreciation expense  is computed on  a straight-line basis  over estimated
useful  lives as prescribed  by regulatory commissions.   Depreciation rate
and  recovery  schedule  changes  granted  by  the Florida Public Service   
Commission (FPSC) resulted  in  a decrease of depreciation expense  in 1993 
of $9.3  million and an increase of $13.6 million in 1992.  After the related 
effects on revenues and income taxes,  the 1993 rate change  increased net 
income by  $4.9 million and the 1992 rate  change decreased net  income by 
$7.1  million.  In 1994,  the FPSC  ordered  the   Company  to  record two   
nonrecurring  charges  to depreciation expense totaling  $6 million.   After 
the related effects on revenues  and income taxes,  these one-time charges 
reduced net income by $2.7 million in  1994.   Average  annual  composite  
depreciation  rates, excluding the  nonrecurring charges, were  6.8 percent 
for 1994, 6.7 percent for 1993 and 7.6 percent for 1992. 
 
Income Taxes
------------
Operations of the Company  are included in the consolidated  federal income
tax returns of Sprint.  Federal income tax is  calculated by the Company on
the basis of its filing a separate return.

Investment tax credits  (ITC) have  been deferred and  are being  amortized
over the useful life  of the related property.

1.  SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (continued)


Interest Charged to Construction
--------------------------------
In accordance  with the Uniform  System of Accounts,  as prescribed by  the
Federal Communications  Commission (FCC), interest has  been capitalized on
those  telephone  plant  construction  projects  for  which  the  estimated
construction period exceeds one year.  In May 1994, the  FPSC staff, citing
the  immateriality   of  such  interest  due  to  reductions  in  long-term
construction projects in  the telecommunications  industry, filed  comments
with  the  FCC   supporting  the   elimination  of   interest  charged   to
construction.  In  addition, the  FPSC directed several  Florida LECs,  the
Company  included, to  cease recognizing  interest charged  to construction
effective November 1, 1994.  

2.  EMPLOYEE BENEFITS PLANS

Effective  January  1,  1994, as  a  result  of  the Sprint/Centel  merger,
employees  of  Central Telephone  Company  of  Florida, an  affiliate,  are
considered  employees of the Company. As  a result, the Company has assumed
the liability for postretirement benefits in the amount of $16.2  million in 
addition to prepaid  pension  costs  of  $2.5  million  related  to  Central 
Telephone Company of Florida's active employees and retirees.

Defined Benefit Pension Plan
----------------------------
Substantially all employees of the Company are covered by a noncontributory
defined benefit pension  plan.  For participants of the plan represented by
collective bargaining units, benefits  are based upon schedules  of defined
amounts  as negotiated  by the  respective parties.   For  participants not
covered  by collective  bargaining  agreements, the  plan provides  pension
benefits based upon years of service and participants' compensation.

The Company's policy is to  make contributions to the plan each  year equal
to an actuarially determined amount consistent with applicable federal  tax
regulations.  The funding objective is to accumulate  funds at a relatively
stable rate over the participants' working lives so that benefits are fully
funded at retirement.  As of December 31, 1994, the plan's assets consisted
principally  of  investments  in   corporate  equity  securities  and  U.S.
government and corporate debt securities.

Defined Contribution Plans
--------------------------
Sprint sponsors three defined  contribution employee savings plans covering
substantially all employees  of the Company.   Participants may  contribute
portions of their compensation to the plans.  Contributions of participants
represented by collective bargaining units are matched by the Company based
upon   defined   amounts  as   negotiated   by   the  respective   parties.
Contributions  of  participants   not  covered  by   collective  bargaining
agreements are also matched  by the Company.   For these participants,  the
Company   provides  matching   contributions   equal  to   50  percent   of
participants'  contributions up to 6 percent of their base compensation and
may, at the discretion  of Sprint's Board of Directors,  provide additional
matching contributions based  upon the performance of Sprint's common stock
price in comparison  to other telecommunications companies.   The Company's
matching   contributions  aggregated  approximately   $5,300,000  in  1994,
$3,800,000 in 1993 and $2,800,000 in 1992.
      

Postretirement Benefits
-----------------------
Sprint sponsors postretirement benefits  (principally health care benefits)
arrangements covering substantially all employees of the Company. Employees
who retired from the Company before  specified dates are eligible for these
postretirement benefits at a very limited cost to  the retirees.  Employees
retiring after specified dates are eligible for these benefits on  a shared
cost basis.  The Company funds the accrued costs as benefits are paid.

Effective January 1, 1993, the Company changed its method of accounting for
postretirement benefits  by adopting  SFAS No. 106,  "Employers' Accounting
for Postretirement Benefits Other Than Pensions."  As permitted by SFAS No.
106, the  Company elected  to recognize  the obligation for  postretirement
benefits already earned by its current retirees and active work force as of
January 1, 1993,  by amortizing  such obligation on  a straight-line  basis
over a  period of twenty years.   For regulatory purposes, the  FCC and the
FPSC  permit  recognition of  net  postretirement  benefit cost,  including
amortization of the transition obligation, in accordance with SFAS No. 106.

During 1992, the costs of providing postretirement benefits to the 
Company's retirees were expensed as such costs were paid.

For measurement purposes,  weighted average annual  health care cost  trend
rates  of  12 percent  and  13  percent were  assumed  for  1994 and  1993,
respectively, gradually  decreasing  to 6  percent  by 2001  and  remaining
constant  thereafter.   The effect of  a 1  percent annual  increase in the
assumed  trend rate  would  have  increased  the  1994  net  postretirement
benefits cost by approximately $3,800,000.  The discount rates for 1994 and
1993 were 7.5 percent and 8.0 percent, respectively.

In  addition, the  Company recognized  postretirement  benefits curtailment
losses of $5,632,000 during 1993 as a result of the  integration actions as
discussed in Note 9.

The cost of providing  postretirement benefits was approximately $2,500,000
in 1992.

</TABLE>
The accumulated benefits obligations as of  December 31, 1994 and 1993 were
determined  using   discount  rates  of   8.5  percent  and   7.5  percent,
respectively.   An annual health  care cost  trend rate of  12 percent  was
assumed for 1995,  gradually decreasing to 6 percent  by 2001 and remaining
constant thereafter.   The  effect of  a 1 percent  annual increase  in the
assumed health care  cost trend rate  would have increased  the accumulated
benefits obligation as of December 31, 1994 by approximately $13,300,000.

Postemployment Benefits
-----------------------
Effective January 1,  1994, the Company  adopted SFAS No.  112, "Employers'
Accounting  for  Postemployment  Benefits."   Upon  adoption,  the  Company
recognized certain  previously unrecorded  obligations  for benefits  being
provided  to  former or  inactive  employees  and  their dependents,  after
employment  but  before   retirement.    The   resulting  charge  did   not
significantly impact  the Company's 1994  net income.   Such postemployment
benefits offered by the Company  include severance, disability and  workers
compensation benefits, including the continuation of other benefits such as
health care and life insurance coverage.

On August  10, 1993,  the Revenue  Reconciliation Act  of 1993  was enacted
which,  among  other  changes,  raised  the  federal  income  tax  rate for
corporations to 35 percent from 34 percent, retroactive to January 1, 1993.
Pursuant  to SFAS  No.  71,  the  resulting adjustments  to  the  Company's
deferred income tax assets and liabilities to reflect the revised rate have
generally  been   reflected  as   reductions  to  the   related  regulatory
liabilities.

The first mortgage bonds and notes  are secured by substantially all of the
Company's property, plant and equipment.

Under  the  most restrictive  terms of  the  Company's first  mortgage bond
indentures,  $423,141,000 of retained earnings were restricted from payment
of dividends at December 31, 1994.

As of  December  31, 1994,  the  Company had  lines  of credit  with  banks
totaling $120,000,000 of  which $10,191,000  was unused.   The bank  lines,
which  are  renewable  in  May  and  June,  1995,  provide  for  short-term
borrowings at market rates  of interest and require annual  commitment fees
based on the  unused portion.  Lines  of credit, which support  outstanding
commercial paper,  may be  withdrawn by  the banks if  there is  a material
adverse change in the financial condition of the Company.  The weighted   
average interest rate on short-term borrowings for 1994 and 1993 is 4.56%
and 3.85%, respectively.

The  Company is in compliance  with all restrictive  or financial covenants
relating to its debt arrangements at December 31, 1994.

During  1994, the  Company  redeemed, prior  to  scheduled maturities,  its
Winter Park 6.50 percent Series I  Bonds for $2.5 million and a portion  of
its  9.25  percent  Series  CC  Bonds  for  $20.5  million  which  includes
principal, interest  and redemption  premiums.    On January 15,  1995, the
Company issued Series HH 8.38 percent  first mortgage bonds for $70 million
which  was  used to  reduce  short-term  debt.   During  1993,  the Company

bonds  with  interest rates  ranging from  7.45  percent to  11.72 percent.
During  1992,  the  Company redeemed  prior  to  scheduled maturities,  $64
million of  First Mortgage  Bonds with  interest rates  ranging from 8  3/4
percent to 10 1/2 percent.   Except for amounts deferred as allowed  by the
FPSC, the  prepayment  penalties  incurred in  connection  with  the  early
extinguishments of debt and  the write off of related  unamortized issuance
costs,  net  of  the   related  income  tax  benefits,  are   reflected  as
extraordinary charges  in the 1994, 1993, and  1992 consolidated statements
of income.  

As  of December 31, 1994, $70 million  of commercial paper is classified as
long-term  debt due  to  the Company's  January  1995 refinancing  of  such
borrowings on a long-term basis as noted above.

<TABLE>

In  accordance with the terms  of the preferred  stock purchase agreements,
the following redemptions  were made in 1994  and 1993, and are to  be made
each year, at par value plus accrued dividends, until all  shares have been

</TABLE>                                              ===

In  addition,  on  December  1,  1992  the  Company  redeemed  all  of  its
outstanding 8.25% preferred stock at $103.09.

The Company may  redeem additional shares  of the  5.4 percent Series  1959
preferred stock and the 5.25 percent Series 1961 preferred  stock at $10.20
per share.  Additional shares of the 5 percent Series  1966 preferred stock

the  holders of  the redeemable  preferred stock  are entitled  to  elect a
majority of the directors until all  dividends and sinking fund payments in
arrears  have been paid.   The preferred stock  purchase agreements contain
provisions  restricting the  payment  of cash  dividends  on common  stock;
however,  at December 31, 1994,  the restriction under  the Company's First
Mortgage Bond indentures as described in Note 4  was more restrictive.

6.  COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES  

Gross rental expense aggregated $10,265,000 in 1994, $8,543,000 in 1993 and
$7,008,000 in 1992.  Minimum rental commitments as of December 31, 1994 for
non-cancelable operating leases are not significant. 

The Company's planned capital expenditures for the year ending December 31,
1995 are approximately $182,000,000.  Normal purchase commitments have been
or will be made for these planned expenditures.

On January 10, 1994, the Company was  sent a letter from AT&T claiming that
the Company was liable, under certain billing agreements, for the refund of
approximately $7 million, plus interest,  of gross receipts taxes collected
and remitted on behalf of  AT&T to the Florida Department of  Revenue.  The
claim was subsequently dismissed without the necessity of a refund.


7.  REGULATORY ACCOUNTING

Consistent  with most local exchange carriers, the Company accounts for the
economic effects of regulation pursuant to SFAS No. 71.  The application of
SFAS  No. 71 requires  the accounting  recognition of  the rate  actions of
regulators  where  appropriate, including  the recognition  of depreciation
based on estimated useful lives prescribed by regulatory commissions rather
than  those that  might  be utilized  by  non-regulated enterprises.    The
Company  currently  believes  its  operations meet  the  criteria  for  the
continued  application  of the  provisions of  SFAS No.  71.   However, the
Company  operates  in  an  evolving  environment  in  which the  regulatory
framework   is  changing  and  the  level  of  competition  is  increasing.
Accordingly, the  Company constantly  monitors  and evaluates  the  ongoing
applicability of SFAS No.  71 by assessing the likelihood that prices which
provide for  the recovery of specific  costs can continue to  be charged to
customers.

The approximate amount of  the Company's net regulatory assets  at December
31, 1994 was  between $100 million and $200 million consisting primarily of
property,  plant and  equipment  and deferred  debt  issuance costs.    The
estimate  for property,  plant and  equipment was  calculated based  upon a
projection  of useful remaining lives which are affected by the development
of  competition, changes  in  regulation, and  the  expansion of  broadband
services to be offered to customers.

8.  RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS

The   Company  purchases  telecommunications  equipment,  construction  and
maintenance  equipment, materials  and supplies  from its  affiliate, North
Supply Company.  Total purchases for 1994,  1993 and 1992 were $72,060,000,
$67,889,000 and $59,980,000, respectively.

Under an agreement with  Sprint, the Company receives, at  cost, consulting
and advisory management services.  In  addition, certain corporate expenses
and a credit resulting  from deferred income taxes on  intercompany profits
are  also allocated  by  Sprint to  affiliated  companies.   Total  charges
aggregated $39,742,000  in 1994,  $45,369,000 in  1993, and $45,108,000  in
1992, and the credit  relating to deferred income taxes  was $1,089,000 and
$1,172,000 in 1993 and 1992, respectively.  The credit relating to deferred
income taxes  was eliminated in  1994.   The Company reimburses  Sprint for
certain data processing  services and  other data related  costs which  are
incurred  for the Company's benefit.   Such charges,  which approximate the
cost  of  such services  as determined  by Sprint,  aggregated $22,704,000,
$21,367,000 and $19,712,000  in 1994,  1993, and 1992,  respectively.   The
Company  enters into cash  advance and borrowing  transactions with Sprint;
generally,  interest  is computed  based  on the  prior  month's thirty-day
average  commercial  paper  index,  as published  in  the  Federal  Reserve
Statistical Release H.15  plus 15 basis  points.  Interest expense  on such
advances  from Sprint was $42,000,  $46,000 and $445,000  in 1994, 1993 and
1992,  respectively.    Interest income  on  such  advances  to Sprint  was
$15,000, $3,000 and $93,000 in 1994, 1993, and 1992, respectively.

The Company provides various services to Sprint, such as facilities rental,
postage, house  services, company  official  toll and  other  miscellaneous
items.   The Company  received $7,314,000,  $11,625,000 and $11,449,000  in
1994, 1993, and 1992, respectively, for such services.  

Sprint Publishing & Advertising, an  affiliate, pays the Company a fee  for
the  right to  publish  telephone directories  in  the Company's  operating
territory,  a listing  fee, and  a fee for  billing and  collection service
performed for Sprint  Publishing & Advertising by  the Company.   For 1994,
1993 and 1992, Sprint Publishing &  Advertising paid the Company a total of
$49,122,000, $45,458,000, and $41,672,000, respectively.  The Company  paid
Sprint Publishing  & Advertising $3,634,000, $3,451,000,  and $2,904,000 in
1994, 1993, and  1992, respectively, for its costs  of publishing the white
page portion of the directories.

8.  RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS (continued)

The   Company  provides   various  services   to  Sprint's   long  distance
communications services  division, such  as  network access,  operator  and
billing and collection services, and the lease  of network facilities.  The
Company received $29,656,000, $25,171,000 and $22,761,000 in 1994, 1993 and
1992, respectively, for  these services.   The Company  paid Sprint's  long
distance  communications  services  division  $11,528,000,  $13,863,000 and
$13,703,000  in  1994,  1993  and  1992,  respectively,  for  interexchange
telecommunication services.

The Company is reimbursed by affiliated companies for certain salaries and 
other costs which are incurred by the Company for the affiliates' benefit.
Also, the Company reimburses affiliated companies for charges incurred by
the affiliates for the Company's benefit.  The reimbursable charges approx-
imate the cost of such items as determined by the Company and the affiliates.
Such amounts reimbursed to the Company, net of reimbursements paid, aggregate
approximately $64 million and $2 million in 1994 and 1993, respectively.

Certain directors and officers of the Company and Sprint are also directors
or officers of banks  at which the Company conducts  borrowings and related
transactions.   The terms  are comparable  with other  banks  at which  the
Company has similar transactions.

9.  MERGER AND INTEGRATION COSTS

Effective  March  9,  1993,  Sprint  consummated  its  merger  with  Centel
Corporation (Centel), a telecommunications company with local exchange  and
cellular and  wireless communications services operations.   Centel's local
exchange  telephone  businesses operate  in  six  states:   Florida,  North
Carolina, Virginia, Illinois, Texas, and Nevada.  Pursuant to the Agreement
and Plan  of Merger dated  May 27, 1992, Sprint  issued 1.37 shares  of its
common stock in exchange for each outstanding share of Centel common stock.
The transaction costs  associated with the merger  (consisting primarily of
investment  banking and  legal fees)  and the  expenses of  integrating and
restructuring the operations of the two companies (consisting  primarily of
employee  severance  and  relocation  expenses  and  costs  of  eliminating
duplicative facilities)  resulted in nonrecurring charges  to Sprint during
1993.   The portion  of such  charges attributable to  the Company  was $51
million, which reduced 1993 net income by approximately $31 million.

Financial Instruments Information

The Company estimates  the fair  value of its  financial instruments  using
available  market  information  and  appropriate  valuation  methodologies.
Accordingly, the estimates presented herein are not necessarily  indicative
of  the values  the Company  could realize  in  a current  market exchange.
Although  management is  not aware  of any  factors that  would  affect the
estimated  fair value  amounts  presented as  of  December 31,  1994,  such
amounts  have  not been  comprehensively  revalued  for  purposes of  these
financial  statements since  that date,  and therefore,  estimates  of fair
value subsequent to  that date  may differ significantly  from the  amounts
presented herein.

The Company's financial  instruments primarily consist  of long-term  debt,
including current maturities, with carrying amounts as of December 31, 1994
and  1993 of  $443,962,000, and  $391,798,000, respectively,  and estimated
fair  values of  $344,267,000  and $471,956,000,  respectively.   The  fair
values  are estimated  based on  quoted  market prices  for publicly-traded
issues, and based on the present value of estimated future cash flows using
a discount rate commensurate with the risks involved for all other issues.
 
The  carrying  values   of  the  Company's   other  financial   instruments
(principally short-term  borrowings) approximate fair value  as of December
31, 1994 and 1993.

The Company has not invested in derivative financial instruments.

(1)  The dollar amounts in these columns are the result of calculations at the 5% and 10% rates set by the 
     SEC and are not intended to forecast future appreciation of Sprint Common Stock.

(2)  Twenty-five percent of the options become exercisable on February 11, 1995 with an additional 25% 
     exercisable on February 11 of each of the three successive years.  Each option has a "reload" feature.
     A reload option is granted when an optionee already owns in payment of the exercise price.  The reload
     option covers the number of shares surrendered in the option exercise (including shares withheld or 
     surrendered for tax withholding, if elected) and has an exercise price equal to the market price on the 
     date of exercise of the original option.  The expiration date of the reload option is the same as the 
     expiration date of the option that was exercised.  The new option becomes exercisable one year from the 
     date the original option was exercised, provided the shares acquired on the exercise of the original
     option are held by the optionee for at least six months.

Long-Term Incentive Plan Awards
-------------------------------
The following table represents potential awards under Sprint's long-term incentive plan
which, subject to Sprint's right to amend the plan at any time prior to the Organization
and Compensation Committee's approval of of payouts, can be earned by the achievement of 
certain financial objectives over the three year period ending December 31, 1996.   The 
payout is based on the achievement of these financial objectives and is adjusted (increased 
or decreased) by the percent change in the market price of Sprint Common Stock as determined
by the change in the average of the high and low prices on January 1, 1994 and December 31, 
1996.  If the stock price increases over the three-year performance period, the payout is
adjusted by the percentage increase in stock price.  Conversely, if the stock price decreases 
over the three-year performance period, the payout is reduced by the percentage decrease in stock 
price. Upon approval of the payouts by the Organization and Compensation Committee, each payout
will be paid as specified by the executive in restricted or unrestricted shares of Sprint Common
Stock, or deferred under the Executive Deferred Compensation Plan.

(1)  Awards are based on a percentage of the Named Officers' average base salary  
     midpoint over the three-year performance cycle which ends December 31, 1996.
     In calculating the average base salary midpoint, the table assumes the base 
     salary midpoint for 1995 and 1996 will equal the 1994 base salary midpoint.
     In addition, the estimated future payouts shown assume that the average of 
     the high and low price of Sprint Common Stock on December 31, 1996 will be
     the same as it was on January 1, 1994.

                                 ARTICLE I
                              Series HH Bonds

Section 1.  There shall be  and are hereby  created "First Mortgage  Bonds,
Series HH"   of   the  principal   amount   of   Seventy  Million   Dollars
($70,000,000), hereinafter  sometimes referred  to as "Series HH  bonds" or
"bonds  of  Series HH". Series HH  bonds  shall be  fully  registered bonds
without coupons authenticated by  the certificate of authentication of  the
Trustee. Each bond of Series HH  shall be dated as of the  interest payment
date  next preceding  the date of  its authentication  upon or  as of which
interest  payment date  payment of  interest  was last  made upon  bonds of
Series HH (unless  (a) issued on an interest payment date to which interest
was paid  upon bonds of Series HH, in  which event it shall  be dated as of
the  date of  issue, or  (b) issued prior  to the  occurrence of  the first
interest payment date on which  interest is payable on bonds of  Series HH,
in which event  it shall be  dated January 26, 1995, or  (c) issued between
the  record date (as hereinbelow defined) for any interest payment date and
such interest  payment date, in which event it shall be dated such interest
payment date)  and shall bear interest  at the annual rate  of interest set
forth hereinafter in  the form of Series HH bonds until  the payment of the
principal thereof,  such  interest  to  be  payable  semi-annually  on  the
fifteenth day of January and July of each year, the  first interest payment
date being July 15, 1995.  All Series HH bonds shall mature  on January 15,
2025. The bonds of Series HH may be issued in the  denomination of $1000 or
any integral multiples thereof. 

The person  in whose name any Series HH bond is  registered at the close of
business  on any record date  (as hereinbelow defined)  with respect to any
interest payment date  shall be  entitled to receive  the interest  payable
thereon on such  interest payment date notwithstanding the  cancellation of
such Series HH bond  upon any  transfer or exchange  thereof subsequent  to
such  record date  and  prior to  such  interest payment  date, unless  the
Company  shall default  in the  payment  of interest  due on  such interest
payment date on any Series HH  bond, in which case such  defaulted interest
shall  be paid  to the  person in whose  name such  Series HH bond  (or any
Series HH  bond or  bonds  issued upon  transfer  or exchange  thereof)  is
registered at the close of business on  the record date for the payment  of
such defaulted interest.  The term "record  date" as used  in this  Section
with respect  to any  interest payment  date  shall mean  the January 1  or
July 1 next preceding  such interest payment date, or, if such January 1 or
July 1  is  not a  business  day,  the  business  day next  preceding  such
January 1 or July 1, and such  term, as used in this Section,  with respect
to the payment of any defaulted interest shall mean the  fifteenth day next
preceding the  date  fixed by  the  Company for  the  payment of  defaulted
interest or, if such fifteenth day is not a business day,  the business day
next preceding such fifteenth day. 

In any  case where  any interest payment  date, or  any date  on which  any
payment of principal is due, whether at stated maturity, upon redemption or
otherwise,  of  any  Series HH  bond shall  not  be  a  business day,  then
(notwithstanding any other provision  of the Indenture or of  the Series HH
bonds) payment of interest or principal need  not be made on such date, but
may be made  on the next  succeeding business day  with the same force  and
effect as if made on the interest payment date or date on which the payment
of principal was due, provided that no interest shall accrue for the period
from and after such interest payment date or date on which such payment  of
principal was due, as the case may be. 

Such bonds  and the certificate  of authentication of the  Trustee shall be
substantially in  the following forms, respectively  (with such appropriate
insertions, omissions,  substitutions and other variations  as are required
or permitted by the Indenture), to wit:

the Company to The Bank of New York, New York, New York, as Trustee,  or to
its predecessor  trustee,  upon  substantially  all  of  the  property  and
franchises  of  the  Company now  owned  or  hereafter  acquired, to  which

indentures  thereto reference  is  hereby made  for  a description  of  the
property transferred and mortgaged thereunder, the nature and extent of the
security  and the rights of  the holders of said bonds,  and of the Trustee
and of  the Company in respect of such security. Subsequent series of bonds
may be issued on such conditions and may vary as to date, date of maturity,
rate  of interest  and in  other  ways as  in such  Indentures provided  or
permitted.

No  reference herein  to the  Original Indenture,  as supplemented,  and no
provision of this bond or of the Original Indenture, as supplemented, shall
alter  or impair  the  obligation of  the Company,  which  is absolute  and

before the stated maturity hereof, as specified in said Original Indenture.

This  bond is transferable by the registered  owner hereof, in person or by
duly authorized  attorney, upon books  of the Company  to be kept  for that
purpose at  the office of the  Trustee under the Indenture,  upon surrender
hereof at said office for  cancellation and upon presentation of a  written
instrument of transfer duly executed, and thereupon the Company shall issue
in the  name  of  the transferee  or  transferees, and  the  Trustee  shall
authenticate and deliver, a new registered bond or bonds, of  like form and
in an authorized  denomination or  in authorized denominations  and of  the
same series, for the same aggregate principal  amount; bonds of this series
upon  surrender thereof  at  said office  may  be  exchanged for  the  same
aggregate  principal amount of bonds  of this series  of another authorized
denomination or  other authorized  denominations; all  upon payment  of the
charges,  if any, and subject to the  terms and conditions specified in the
Indenture. 

The Company and the  Trustee may treat the registered owner of this bond as

provision of  the first paragraph hereof,  and for all other  purposes, and
neither the Company nor the Trustee nor any paying agent or agency shall be
affected by  any notice to the  contrary whether this bond  or the interest
thereon shall be overdue or not. 

No  recourse shall  be  had for  the  payment of  the principal  of  or the
interest on this bond or of any  claim based hereon or in respect hereof or
of  said Original  Indenture,  as supplemented,  against any  incorporator,
subscriber, stockholder, officer or director  of the Company, past, present
or future, whether directly or through a receiver in bankruptcy, whether by
virtue of any constitution, statute or rule of law or by the enforcement of
any assessment  or penalty or otherwise,  all such liability being,  by the
acceptance of this bond, expressly released.

This  bond is one of the First  Mortgage Bonds, Series HH, provided for and
described  in the  Thirty-Fifth Supplemental  Indenture of  Mortgage within
mentioned.

                            The Bank of New York
                             As Trustee

                                   By___________________________
                                        Authorized Signature

Section 2.  Series HH bonds  redeemed pursuant to any of the provisions  of
Article Six  of the  Indenture (including redemptions  pursuant to  Section
6.11 with the proceeds from the sale of property pursuant  to Section 9.04)
may  be redeemed at any  time at a redemption  price equal to the principal
amount thereof together with  interest accrued and unpaid to the date fixed
for redemption. The  Trustee shall select bonds to be  redeemed pursuant to
any of the provisions  of Article Six of the Indenture,  in such manner as,
in its discretion, it shall deem appropriate and equitable and not designed
to result in disproportionate redemption of Series HH bonds in relationship
to other series of bonds. 

Section 3.  In  case  of  the redemption  of  any  of  the Series HH  bonds
pursuant  to  any  of  the  provisions  of  Article  Six of  the  Indenture
(including redemptions pursuant to Section 6.11 with the  proceeds from the
sale of property pursuant  to Section 9.04), the Trustee shall  give notice
of such redemption to the holders of the Series HH bonds to be redeemed  as
hereinafter in this Section provided. 

Notice of redemption shall be given to the holders of Series HH bonds to be
redeemed  as a  whole or  in part  by mailing  by registered  mail, postage
prepaid, a notice  of such redemption  not less than  thirty nor more  than
sixty days prior  to the date fixed for redemption  to their last addresses
as  they shall  appear upon  the bond  register, but  failure to  give such
notice by  mailing in  the  manner herein  provided to  the  holder of  any
Series HH bond  designated for  redemption as  a whole or  in part,  or any
defect therein,  shall not affect the  validity of the  proceedings for the
redemption of any other Series HH bonds. 

Any  notice  which  is  mailed  in  the  manner  herein provided  shall  be
conclusively presumed to have  been duly given,  whether or not the  holder
receives the notice. 

Each such notice of redemption shall  specify the date fixed for redemption
and the redemption  price at which Series HH bonds are  to be redeemed, and
shall state  that payment of the redemption price of the Series HH bonds to
be redeemed will be made at the office of the Trustee upon presentation and
surrender of such Series HH bonds,  that interest accrued to the date fixed
for  redemption will be paid  as specified in said  notice, and that on and
after said date interest thereon will cease to accrue. If less than all the
Series HH bonds are to be redeemed, the notice of  redemption shall specify
the Series HH bonds  to be  redeemed as  a whole or  in part.  In case  any
Series HH bond is to be redeemed in part only, the notice which  relates to
such Series HH bond shall state the portion of the principal amount thereof
to be  redeemed (which shall be  $1,000 or any integral  multiple thereof),
and shall  state that on and  after the redemption date,  upon surrender of
such  Series HH bond,  the  holder will  receive  the redemption  price  in
respect  of the principal amount thereof called for redemption and, without
charge, a new bond or bonds of that series and  of authorized denominations
for the principal amount thereof remaining unredeemed. 

Section 4.  If the giving of notice of redemption shall have been completed
as above provided, the Series HH bonds or portions of such bonds  specified
in such notice  shall become due and  payable on the date and  at the place
stated  in  such notice  at the  redemption  price, together  with interest
accrued to the date fixed for redemption, and on and after such  date fixed
for redemption interest on the Series HH bonds or portions of such bonds so
called  for redemption shall cease to accrue. On presentation and surrender
of such Series HH bonds at said  place of payment in said notice specified,
the said  Series HH bonds  shall be  paid and  redeemed  at the  redemption
price, together with interest accrued to the date fixed for redemption. 

Section 5.  Bonds of Series HH,  upon surrender thereof at the  main office
of the Trustee, may be exchanged for the same aggregate principal amount of
bonds of that series of other authorized denominations. Within a reasonable
time after the surrender of bonds of Series HH accompanied by a request for
such  an  exchange,  the  Company  shall  execute  and  the  Trustee  shall
authenticate and deliver all bonds required in connection therewith. 

Upon surrender for registration of transfer of any bonds, the Company shall
execute and the  Trustee shall authenticate and deliver in  the name of the
transferee or transferees a new bond or bonds of the same series for a like
aggregate principal amount. 

All bonds presented or surrendered for exchange,  registration of transfer,
redemption, or payment shall, if so required by the Company or the Trustee,
be accompanied by a  written instrument or instruments of transfer, in form
satisfactory to the Company or the Trustee, duly executed by the registered
holder or by his attorney duly authorized in writing. 

No service  charge  shall  be made  for  any exchange  or  registration  of
transfer of bonds, but the Company may require payment of  a sum sufficient
to  cover any  tax or  other  governmental charge  that may  be imposed  in
relation thereto. 

The Company shall not  be required (a) to  issue, exchange or register  the
transfer of  any bonds during a period beginning at the opening of business
15 days before the day  of the mailing  of a notice  of redemption of  less
than all the outstanding  bonds and ending at the close  of business on the
day  of such mailing,  or (b) to register  the transfer of  or exchange any
bonds or portions thereof called or selected for redemption. 

Section 6.  Upon or at any time  and from time to time after  the execution
and delivery of this  Thirty-Fifth Supplemental Indenture, the  Company may
execute  and deliver to  the Trustee  and, subject  to Section 4.01  of the
Indenture, the Trustee shall authenticate and deliver to or upon  the order
of the Company Seventy Million Dollars ($70,000,000) in aggregate principal
amount of Series HH bonds.

respect to the Series HH bonds, elect to have either Section 2 or Section 3
of  this  Article II  be  applied   to  the  outstanding  Series HH   bonds
(hereinafter  in this  Article II, the  "Defeased Bonds"),  upon compliance
with the conditions set forth in this Article II. 

Section 2.  Defeasance and Discharge.

Upon the Company's exercise of  the option applicable to this  Section, the
Company  shall be deemed to have been  discharged from its obligations with
respect to  the outstanding Defeased Bonds  on the date the  conditions set
forth below  are satisfied  (hereinafter, "defeasance"). For  this purpose,
such defeasance means  that the Company  shall be deemed  to have paid  and
discharged the entire indebtedness  represented by the outstanding Defeased
Bonds and to  have satisfied all its  other obligations under  the Defeased
Bonds and  the Indenture insofar as  the Defeased Bonds are  concerned (and
the   Trustee,  at  the  expense  of  the  Company,  shall  execute  proper
instruments acknowledging the  same), except for the following  which shall
survive until otherwise terminated  or discharged hereunder: (A) the rights
of holders  of outstanding Defeased Bonds to receive, solely from the trust
fund described in Section 4 of this Article II and as  more fully set forth
in such  Section, payments in respect  of the principal of  and interest on
the  Defeased  Bonds  when   such  payments  are  due,  (B) the   Company's
obligations with respect to such  Defeased Bonds under Sections 1.10, 1.12,
1.13, 12.02 and  15.01 of  the Indenture, (C) the  rights, powers,  trusts,
duties,  and immunities  of the  Trustee under  the Indenture  and (D) this
Article II. Subject  to compliance  with this Article II,  the Company  may
exercise its option under this Section 2 notwithstanding the prior exercise
of  its option  under  Section 3 of  this  Article II with  respect to  the
Defeased Bonds. 

Section 3.  Covenant Defeasance.

Upon the Company's exercise of  the option applicable to this Section,  the
Defeased Bonds shall no longer  be entitled to the benefits of the  lien of
the Indenture, which shall be deemed to be released for all purposes of the
Indenture with respect  to the Defeased Bonds, and the Defeased Bonds shall
not  be deemed  to  be  outstanding for  purposes  of  Section 4.01 of  the
Indenture,  on  and after  the  date  the conditions  set  forth  below are
satisfied (hereinafter, "covenant defeasance"). 

Section 4.  Conditions to Defeasance.

The following shall be the conditions to application of either Section 2 or
Section 3 of this Article II to the outstanding Series HH bonds: 

(1)  the Company shall irrevocably have deposited or caused to be deposited
with  the Trustee  (or  another  trustee  satisfying  the  requirements  of
Section 12.07  of the  Indenture,  who  shall  agree  to  comply  with  the
provisions of  this Article II applicable to  it), as trust funds  in trust
for the purpose of  making the following payments, specifically  pledged as
security for,  and dedicated solely to,  the benefit of the  holders of the
Defeased Bonds, (A) money  in an amount, or (B) U.S. Government Obligations
which  through the scheduled payment  of principal and  interest in respect
thereof in accordance with their terms will provide, not later than one day
before  the  due  date  of  any  payment,  money  in  an  amount, or  (C) a
combination thereof,  sufficient, in the opinion of a nationally recognized
firm of independent public accountants expressed in a written certification
thereof delivered to the Trustee, to pay and discharge, and  which shall be
applied by the Trustee  (or other qualifying trustee) to pay and discharge,
the principal of and each  installment of principal of and interest  on the
outstanding  Defeased Bonds  on the  stated maturity  of such  principal or
installment of  principal or interest.  For this purpose,  "U.S. Government
Obligations" means securities that are (x) direct obligations of the United
States  of America for the  payment of which  its full faith  and credit is
pledged  or (y) obligations  of a  person controlled  or supervised  by and
acting as  an agency or instrumentality of the United States of America the
payment  of which is unconditionally guaranteed  as a full faith and credit
obligation by the United States of  America, which, in either case, are not
callable or  redeemable at the option of the issuer thereof, and shall also
include   a  depository   receipt  issued   by  a   bank  (as   defined  in
Section 3(a)(2) of the  Securities Act  of 1933, as  amended) as  custodian
with respect to any such  U.S. Government Obligation or a specific  payment
of principal of or interest on any such U.S. Government  Obligation held by
such  custodian for the account  of the holder  of such depository receipt,
provided that (except  as required by law) such custodian is not authorized
to  make  any deduction  from  the amount  payable  to the  holder  of such
depository receipt from any amount received by  the custodian in respect of
the  U.S. Government Obligation or the  specific payment of principal of or
interest on  the U.S.  Government Obligation  evidenced by such  depository
receipt. 

(2)  No event of default  or event which  with notice or  lapse of time  or
both would  become an event of  default with respect to  the Defeased Bonds
shall  have occurred  and be  continuing on  the date  of such  deposit or,
insofar  as Section 8.01(e)  is concerned,  at any  time during  the period
ending on the 91st day after the date of such deposit or, if longer, ending
on  the day  following  the expiration  of  the longest  preference  period
applicable to the Company  in respect of such deposit (it  being understood
that  this condition shall not be  deemed satisfied until the expiration of
such period). 

(3)  Such defeasance or covenant defeasance shall not cause the Trustee for
the  Defeased  Bonds  to   have  a  conflicting  interest  as   defined  in
Section 12.14 of the Indenture and for purposes of  the Trust Indenture Act
of 1939, as amended, with respect to any securities of the Company. 

(4)  Such defeasance or covenant defeasance shall not result in a breach or
violation of,  or constitute a  default under,  the Indenture or  any other
agreement or instrument to which  the Company is a party or by  which it is
bound. 

(5)  Such defeasance  or covenant defeasance  shall not cause  any Defeased
Bonds  then listed on any registered national securities exchange under the
Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, to be delisted. 

(6)  In  the case of  an election under  Section 2 of this  Article II, the
Company shall have delivered to  the Trustee an opinion of  counsel stating
that (x) the Company has received from, or there has been published by, the
Internal Revenue Service a  ruling, or (y) subsequent to  January 15, 1995,
there has been a change in the applicable Federal income tax  law in either
case to the effect that, and based thereon such opinion shall confirm that,
the  holders of the outstanding  Defeased Bonds will  not recognize income,
gain or loss for Federal income tax purposes as a result of such defeasance
and will be  subject to Federal income tax on the same amounts, in the same
manner and at the same times as would have been the case if such defeasance
had not occurred. 

(7)  In  the case  of an election  under Section 3 of  this Article II, the
Company shall  have delivered to the  Trustee an opinion of  counsel to the
effect  that the  holders  of  the  outstanding  Defeased  Bonds  will  not
recognize income, gain or loss for Federal income tax purposes  as a result
of such  covenant defeasance and will  be subject to Federal  income tax on
the same  amounts, in the same manner  and at the same  times as would have
been the case if such covenant defeasance had not occurred. 

Section 5.  Deposited Money  and U.S. Government Obligations to be  Held in
Trust; Miscellaneous.

All  money and U.S. Government Obligations (including the proceeds thereof)
deposited with  the Trustee (or other  qualifying trustee_collectively, for
purposes  of this Section 5, the  "Trustee") pursuant to  Section 4 of this
Article II  in respect of  the outstanding Defeased Bonds  shall be held in
trust and applied by the Trustee, in accordance with the  provisions of the
Defeased  Bonds and  the  Indenture, to  the  payment, either  directly  or
through any Paying  Agent (including the Company  acting as its  own Paying
Agent) as the Trustee may determine, to the holders of  the Defeased Bonds,
of all  sums due  and to  become due  thereon in respect  of principal  and
interest, but  such money need not be segregated from other funds except to
the extent required by law. 

The  Company shall pay  and indemnify the  Trustee against any  tax, fee or
other charge imposed on or assessed against the U.S. Government Obligations
deposited pursuant to  Section 4 of  this Article II or  the principal  and
interest received  in respect thereof other than any such tax, fee or other
charge which by law  is for the account  of the holders of the  outstanding
Defeased Bonds. 

Anything in this  Article II to the  contrary notwithstanding, the  Trustee
shall  deliver or  pay to the  Company from  time to time  upon the written
request of  the Company any money or U.S. Government Obligations held by it
as  provided in  Section 4 of this  Article II which,  in the  opinion of a
nationally recognized firm of independent public accountants expressed in a
written  certification thereof delivered to  the Trustee, are  in excess of
the  amount thereof which would then be  required to be deposited to effect
an equivalent defeasance or covenant defeasance. 

Section 6.  Notice of Defeasance.

Notice  of defeasance or covenant  defeasance shall be  given by registered
mail,  postage prepaid, mailed not more  than 30 days following the date of
deposit  of money or U.S.  Government Obligations pursuant  to Section 4 of
this Article II, to the  holders of Defeased Bonds at their  last addresses
as they appear on  the bond register  not less than  10 days prior to  such
date of mailing. Notice of defeasance or covenant defeasance shall be given
by the Company or, at the Company's request, by the Trustee in the name and
at the expense of the Company.

                                 ARTICLE IV

                               CAPITAL STOCK

(a)   Amount and  Designation  of Classes  - The  amount  of capital  stock
authorized is  $57,000,000, consisting of three  classes: 16,000,000 shares
of  Common Stock of  the par value  of $2.50 each, having  an aggregate par
value of $40,000,000; 1,500,000 shares of Preferred Stock  of the par value
of $10.00 each, having an aggregate par value of $15,000,000; and 2,000,000
shares of  Class A Cumulative  Preferred Stock  of the par  value of  $1.00
each,  having an  aggregate par  value of  $2,000,000.   Shares of  Class A
Cumulative Preferred  Stock shall  be of  equal rank and  on a  parity with
share of Preferred Stock.

Each issue of Preferred Stock and Class A Cumulative Preferred Stock  shall
be designated by a series for the year in which it is issued.  The Board of
Directors of the  Corporation shall  have the authority,  by resolution  or
resolutions in the  form of a Certificate of Designation,  to establish and
designate the respective series and, consistent with the provisions of this
Article IV, to fix and determine for each series:

(i)  the rate or manner of payment of dividends on shares of such series;

(ii)   the redemption price and  the terms and conditions  of redemption of
shares of such series;

(iii)   the  amount payable  upon shares  of such  series in  the  event of
voluntary and involuntary liquidation;

(iv)   sinking fund provisions, if  any, for the redemption  or purchase of
shares of such series;

(v)   the terms and conditions, if any, on  which shares of such series may
be converted;

(vi)  in the case of Class A Cumulative Preferred Stock,  voting rights, if
any.

(b)  Dividends on Preferred Stock and on Class A Cumulative Preferred Stock
- The holders of record  of Preferred Stock of any series shall be entitled
to receive,  when and as  declared by  the Board of  Directors, out of  the
earning of the  Corporation, cash dividends  at such rates  as agreed  upon
between  the purchases and the  Corporation in the  case of private issues,
and at such  rates as authorized by  the Board of Directors in  the case of
public issues, but  in any event  not in excess of  60 cents per  share per

                                    -2-


annum, payable  in four  equal quarterly installments  on the  1st days  of
January, April,  July and October of  each year.  Each  series of Preferred
Stock shall carry such dividend rate as prescribed for that series.

The holders of  record of Class A Cumulative Preferred  Stock of any series
shall  be  entitled to  receive,  when  and as  declared  by  the Board  of
Directors, out of the  earnings of the Corporation, cash  dividends at such
rates as agreed upon between the purchasers and the Corporation in the case
of  private  issues, and  at  such  rates as  authorized  by  the Board  of
Directors in the  case of public  issues, payable  in four equal  quarterly
installments of the 1st days of March, June, September and December in each
year.  Each series of  Class A Cumulative Preferred Stock shall  carry such
dividend rate as prescribed for that series.

The record date for the payment of dividends on the Preferred Stock and the
Class A Cumulative Preferred Stock shall be the date, not to exceed 60 days
preceding the dividend  payment date, fixed from time to  time by the Board
of Directors.

Dividends on all  series of the  Preferred Stock and on  all series of  the
Class A Cumulative Preferred Stock shall be payable before:

(i)   Any  dividends shall be  declared, paid on  or set apart  for, or any
distribution made or ordered in respect of, Common Stock, or

(ii)  Any  moneys shall be set  aside for or  applied to the redemption  of
Common Stock, or

(iii)  Any  sum shall be paid or set apart  for the redemption of Preferred
Stock or Class A Cumulative Preferred Stock.

Dividends  upon the  Preferred  Stock of  any  series and  on  the Class  A
Cumulative  Preferred Stock of any series  shall be cumulative from date of
issue and shall  be deemed to accrue from day to  day regardless of whether
or not the Corporation shall  have funds legally available for  the payment
of such dividends, but  accumulation of dividends shall not  bear interest.
No dividend shall be declared on any series of the Preferred Stock or Class
A Cumulative  Preferred Stock for any quarter-yearly dividend period unless
there  shall likewise  be  paid  or  declared and  set  apart  for  payment
dividends on  all shares  at  the time  outstanding of  all  series of  the
Preferred Stock and Class A Cumulative  Preferred Stock, in respect of  the
then current quarter-yearly  dividend period for each series.   In case the
dividends for such  period are not  paid in full,  all shares of  Preferred
Stock   and  Class  A  Cumulative  Preferred  Stock  of  all  series  shall
participate ratably in  the payment of dividends in  proportion to the full
amounts of dividends for the then current quarter-yearly dividend period to
which they are respectively entitled.

(c)    Purchase Fund  or  Sinking  Fund for  Preferred  Stock  and Class  A
Cumulative Preferred Stock - A purchase  fund or an annual sinking fund for
the retirement  of Preferred Stock of  any series or for  the retirement of
Class  A  Cumulative Preferred  Stock  of  any series  may  or  may not  be
prescribed as agreed upon between the purchasers and the Corporation in the

                                    -3-
                                       

case of private issues  and as authorized or not authorized by the Board of
Directors in the case of public issues.

Such  purchase fund  or sinking fund  as may  be prescribed  for any series
shall be  cumulative so  that if  less than the  required number  of shares
shall be acquired  by the Corporation in  any year on or before  the annual
payment date specified for such series, the amount of such deficiency shall
thereafter  be acquired  by  the Corporation  and  such deficiency  removed
before:

(i)  Any  dividends shall be  declared, paid on  or set  apart for, or  any
distribution made or ordered in respect of, Common Stock, or

(ii)   Any moneys  shall be set aside  for or applied  to the redemption of
Common Stock, or

(iii)  Any  sum shall be paid  or set apart for the  optional redemption of
Preferred Stock or Class A Cumulative Preferred Stock.

(d)  Redemption of Preferred Stock and Class A Cumulative Preferred Stock -

(1)  Right to Redeem and Price - Any  and all Preferred Stock of any series
not called  for sinking fund purposes  under any series may  be redeemed at
the option of the Corporation on any dividend payment date by resolution of
its  Board of  Directors and upon  30 days'  written notice  thereof to the
holders of such Preferred Stock of any series at a price or prices and over
such  periods of time as may be  agreed upon between the purchasers and the
Corporation in the case of private issues and as authorized by the Board of
Directors in the  case of public issues, plus an  amount equal to dividends
accruing and  unpaid on such Preferred  Stock up to and  including the date
fixed for redemption whether or not earned or declared.

Any and all Class A Cumulative Preferred Stock of any series not called for
sinking fund purposes under any series may be redeemed at the option of the
Corporation at  any time or times  by resolution of its  Board of Directors
and upon  30 days' written and  published notice thereof to  the holders of
such Class  A Cumulative Preferred Stock of any series at a price or prices
and over such periods of time as  may be agreed upon between the purchasers
and the Corporation in the case of private issues and as authorized  by the
Board of Directors in  the case of public  issues, plus an amount equal  to
dividends accruing and unpaid on such Class A Cumulative Preferred Stock up
to  and including the  date fixed for  redemption whether or  not earned or
declared.

(2)  Manner of  Redemption - If less than all of  the outstanding shares of
Preferred Stock and Class A Cumulative Preferred Stock are to be called for
redemption,  redemption  may be  made  of  the whole  or  any  part of  the
outstanding shares  of any one or more series thereof, in the discretion of
the Board of Directors, and if less  than all of the outstanding shares  of
any series are to  be redeemed, the  shares of such  series to be  redeemed
shall be selected  either by lot or pro rata, as determined and in a manner
prescribed for such series.

                                    -4-
                                   

(3)  Notice of Redemption - Not less than  30 or more than 60 days previous
to the date fixed for redemption or purchase for the sinking fund, a notice
specifying the  time and place  thereof shall  be given to  the holders  of
record of  Preferred Stock  of  any series  or of  the  Class A  Cumulative
Preferred  Stock of any series to be redeemed  or so purchased, by mail, in
the  names   and  at  the  addresses  as  the  same  shall  appear  on  the
stockholders' ledger maintained  by the  Corporation and also  as may  have
theretofore  been  furnished   in  writing  to  the   Corporation  by  such
stockholders.   The time of  mailing such notice shall  be deemed to be the
time of  the giving thereof.   In  the case of  the optional redemption  of
Class  A Cumulative Preferred Stock, the Corporation shall also give notice
of  the proposed redemption, not less than 30 or more than 60 days prior to
the  date fixed  for redemption, by  publication at  least once  in a daily
newspaper printed in  the English  language and of  general circulation  in
Orange County, the State of  Florida, and in the Borough of  Manhattan, the
City  and State  of New York.   At any  time after notice  of redemption or
purchase for  the sinking  fund  has been  given in  the manner  prescribed
above,  the Corporation may  deposit the  aggregate redemption  or purchase
price in trust with the bank or trust company (in  good standing, organized
under the laws of the United States of America, or of the State of Florida,
doing business in the City of Orlando, Orange County, Florida, and having a
combined capital and  surplus aggregating at  least $50,000,000), named  in
such notice for payment on the date fixed for redemption or purchase to the
holders  of shares  so  to  be redeemed  or  purchased (on  endorsement  if
required by the Board  of Directors), and upon surrender of certificates of
such shares, upon the deposit of such money, or if no such deposit is made,
upon such redemption or purchase date (unless the Corporation shall default
in making  payment of  the  redemption or  purchase price  as  set in  such
notice)  such holders shall cease  to be stockholders  with respect to such
shares  and  shall have  no voting  or other  rights  with respect  to such
shares,  except the  right to  receive such  moneys on  the date  fixed for
redemption  or  purchase from  such  bank  or trust  company,  or  from the
Corporation, without  interest thereon,  upon endorsement if  required, and
surrender  of the certificates, and the shares represented thereby shall no
longer  be outstanding; provided, however,  that no then  existing right of
conversion, if  any, with respect to  such shares shall be  impaired by the
deposit of  money prior to the  redemption or purchase date.   In case less
than  all the  shares  represented  by  any  surrendered  certificates  are
redeemed or purchased,  a new  certificate shall be  issued without  charge
representing the unredeemed shares.

(4)   Unclaimed Deposits -  The Corporation  shall be entitled  to receive,
from time to  time, from the  depository the interest,  if any, allowed  on
such moneys deposited with it, and the holders of any shares so redeemed or
purchased  shall  have no  claim  to  any such  interest.    Any moneys  so
deposited  and remaining  unclaimed at the  end of  two (2)  years from the
redemption or purchase date shall, if thereafter requested by resolution of
the Board  of Directors, be repaid to the  Corporation, and in the event of
such  repayment,  such  holders  of record  of  the  shares  so  called for
redemption or purchase  as shall not  have made claim  against such  moneys
prior to  such repayment to the Corporation shall be deemed to be unsecured
creditors  of  the  Corporation for  an  amount  equivalent  to the  amount
deposited as above stated for the redemption or purchase of such shares and

                                    -5-
                                     

so  repaid to the  Corporation, but shall  in no  event be entitled  to any
interest.

(5)   Cancellation of Redeemed Shares  - All shares of  Preferred Stock and
Class A Cumulative Preferred Stock redeemed or purchased by the Corporation
shall be  cancelled, but such cancellation shall  not operate to reduce the
total  authorized capital;  other  shares of  Preferred  Stock or  Class  A
Cumulative Preferred  Stock may  be issued in  lieu thereof, but  shares so
acquired  shall not be  reissued as shares  of the same  or any theretofore
outstanding series.

(e)   Preference  as  to Assets  -  The  Preferred Stock  and  the Class  A
Cumulative Preferred Stock of any series shall be preferred over the Common
Stock  as  to  the  net  assets  of the  Corporation  no  matter  in  which
liabilities the net assets  are reflected on its balance  sheet, including,
but not limiting the generality thereof, liabilities for stated capital and
surplus.

(f)  Dissolution -

(1)  Involuntary Dissolution - In the event of any involuntary dissolution,
liquidation  or winding  up of  the Corporation,  the holders  of Preferred
Stock of any series shall be entitled  to receive out of the net assets  of
the  Corporation the  par value  thereof, and  the holders  of the  Class A
Cumulative  Preferred Stock of any series shall  be entitled to receive out
of the  net assets  of the Corporation  the amount  per share fixed  in the
Articles  of Incorporation for  such series,  plus in  each case  an amount
equal to all dividends accrued and unpaid on each share up to and including
the date fixed for distribution, whether  or not earned or declared, and no
more, before any distribution shall be made to the holders of Common Stock.

(2)  Voluntary  Dissolution - In  the event  of any voluntary  dissolution,
liquidation or winding up of the Corporation, or any voluntary reduction of
its capital Stock resulting in the distribution of any of its net assets to
its  stockholders, the  holders of Preferred  Stock of any  series shall be
entitled to  receive out of  the net  assets of the  Corporation an  amount
equal to the dividends accumulated and  unpaid thereon, up to and including
the date  fixed  for distribution,  together  with  the par  value  of  the
Preferred Stock and  the then existing  call price premium  fixed for  that
series  of Preferred Stock, and the holders of Class A Cumulative Preferred
Stock shall be entitled to receive out of the net assets of the Corporation

including  the date  fixed for  distribution, together  with an  amount per
share  fixed for  the  redemption of  that  series  of Class  A  Cumulative
Preferred Stock, before any  distribution shall be  made to the holders  of
Common Stock.

(3)  Pro Rate Distribution - If upon liquidation, dissolution or winding-up
of the Corporation, whether voluntary or involuntary, the net assets of the
Corporation  shall  be  insufficient to  permit  the  payment  of the  full
preferential  amount to  which the  shares of Preferred  Stock and  Class A
Cumulative Preferred Stock  are entitled, then the entire net assets of the
Corporation  shall be  distributed  ratably to  all  outstanding shares  of

                                    -6-
                                     

Preferred Stock and Class A Cumulative Preferred Stock in proportion to the
full preferential amount  to which each such share is  entitled.  Neither a
consolidation  nor merger  of  the  Corporation  with  or  into  any  other
corporate  entity or entities, nor the sale  of all or substantially all of
the assets  of  the Corporation,  shall  be  deemed to  be  a  liquidation,
dissolution or winding-up within the meaning of this section.

any Common Stock while any default exists in the payment of any dividend or
any sinking  fund requirement of any  series of Preferred Stock  or Class A
Cumulative Preferred Stock.  The term "Common Stock" wherever  used in this
Article IV means stock  of any class junior to the  Preferred Stock and the
Class A Cumulative Preferred Stock whether or not such stock is denominated
as Common Stock.

(h)  Rights of Holders of Preferred Stock and Class  A Cumulative Preferred
Stock as  to Limitation on Certain Corporate  Actions - Without the consent
of the holder or holders of an amount equal to or  exceeding two-thirds par
value  of the  then outstanding  Preferred Stock  (all series) voting  as a
class  and  the holder  or  holders  of at  least  two-thirds  of the  then
outstanding Class A  Cumulative Preferred  Stock (all series)  voting as  a
class the Corporation shall not:

(i)  Authorize or create,  or increase the authorized amount of,  any stock
ranking  prior to the Preferred Stock and  the Class A Cumulative Preferred
Stock, or  authorize or create, or  increase the authorized amount  of, any
stock or obligations convertible  into or evidencing the right  to purchase
any  stock ranking prior to the Preferred  Stock and the Class A Cumulative
Preferred Stock.

(ii)  Issue any stock ranking prior  to the Preferred Stock and the Class A
Cumulative Preferred Stock.

(iii)  Pay any cash dividend on the Common Stock of the Corporation  except
out of  the net income  or earned surplus  of the  Corporation and only  if
after  the payment of such dividends the  earned surplus of the Corporation
shall be in the amount of $300,000 or in excess thereof.

(iv)   Allow the total of the  funded debt and the  Preferred Stock and the
Class A  Cumulative Preferred Stock  of all series  outstanding at any  one
time to exceed an amount equal  to 70% of the total  paid-in-capitalization
and earned surplus.

(v)   Retire, purchase  or otherwise  acquire for value  any of  the Common
Stock of the Corporation, or pay, set aside or make available any moneys to
or for a  sinking fund for  the purchase or redemption  of any such  Common
Stock.

(vi)    Amend, alter,  modify,  waive or  repeal  any of  the  covenants or
provisions of  the Articles of Incorporation so  as to adversely affect the
Preferred Stock or the Class A Cumulative Preferred Stock or the holders of
such  stock; provided,  however, that  if any  such  amendment, alteration,
modification, waiver or repeal would adversely affect any particular series

                                    -7-
                                     

without correspondingly affecting all  series, then a like vote  or consent
by  the holders  of the  shares  of that  particular series  shall also  be
necessary  for  effecting or  validating  any  such amendment,  alteration,
modification, waiver or repeal.

(vii)   Merge or consolidate  with or into  any other corporation,  if as a
result  thereof, (a)  the surviving  corporation would  have  authorized or
outstanding any shares of stock ranking prior to the Preferred Stock or the
Class A Cumulative Preferred Stock, or (b) any holder of Preferred Stock or
Class  A  Cumulative Preferred  Stock immediately  prior  to the  merger or
consolidation would receive a  different number of shares of  the surviving
corporation, or  (c)  there would  be  any adverse  change  in the  rights,
preferences,  terms, provisions  and  powers of  any outstanding  Preferred
Stock or Class A Cumulative Preferred Stock of any series.

(i)  Voting Rights of Stockholders -

(1)   General - At each meeting of  the stockholders every holder of Common
Stock and Preferred Stock (all series) shall be entitled to  cast one vote,
on each matter  on which stockholders of record shall  be entitled to vote,
for each share  of such stock standing in such holder's  name on the record
books of the Corporation on the record date fixed for  the determination of
stockholders  entitled to vote  at such meeting.   Such holders  shall vote
together on  all such matters and not by classes or series, except when and
as may be otherwise required by law or these Articles of Incorporation.

Unless otherwise provided for a  specific series of the Class A  Cumulative
Preferred  Stock, the  Class  A Cumulative  Preferred  Stock shall  not  be
entitled to  notice of any meeting  of shareholders and shall  not have the
right  to vote  for the  election of  directors or  for any  other purpose,
except as set forth in subsection (2) below.

(2)   Special  Voting  Rights of  Preferred  Stock and  Class A  Cumulative
Preferred Stock  - The holders of  Preferred Stock (all eries)  voting as a
class shall be entitled to  elect a majority of the Board of Directors, and
the  holders  of Class  A Cumulative  Preferred  Stock (all  series) voting
together as a  class shall be entitled to elect two members of the Board of
Directors, if:

(i)  a default has occurred in the provisions set out in section (h); or

(ii)   default has occurred in  the payment of four  quarterly dividends on
the  Preferred  Stock or  the  Class A  Cumulative Preferred  Stock  of any
series; or

(iii)    default  has  occurred   in  the  payment  of  two   sinking  fund
installments, or calling of  stock for sinking fund requirements in each of
two years.

Whenever such voting  rights vest in  the holders of  Preferred Stock  (all
series)  and Class A Cumulative  Preferred Stock (all  series), such rights
shall  be exercisable  either at  a  special meeting  or  meetings of  such
holders or  at any annual meeting  of shareholders held for  the purpose of

                                    -8-

                                     
electing directors.  In addition to the right to elect  two directors, upon
the vesting of such voting rights in the Class A Cumulative Preferred Stock
and except  for  the right  of the  holders  of the  Common Stock  and  the
Preferred Stock to elect the remaining  directors, the holders of the Class
A Cumulative Preferred Stock shall have the right to receive notice of, and
to vote at, any meeting of  the shareholders in the same manner as  holders
of the Common Stock and Preferred Stock.

Such voting rights shall continue until  such default or defaults are cured
and all dividends on, and sinking fund requirements of, the Preferred Stock
and  Class A  Cumulative Preferred  Stock are  currently paid  and complied
with, at which time such  rights shall cease and the term of  office of all
directors elected by the  Preferred Stock and Class A  Cumulative Preferred
Stock shall terminate.


(3)   Procedure for Exercising Special Voting  Rights of Class A Cumulative
Preferred Stock  - At any  time when  the special voting  right shall  have
vested in the holders of the Class A Cumulative Preferred Stock as provided
in subsection (2), and if such  right shall not already have been initially
exercised,  a proper  officer of  the Corporation  shall, upon  the written
request  of the holders of  record of at least  twenty percent (20%) of the
Class A  Cumulative  Preferred  Stock  then outstanding  addressed  to  the
Secretary of  the Corporation, call a  special meeting of  all such holders
for the purpose of exercising their rights.   Such meeting shall be held at
the earliest  practicable date at a  place in the city  where the principal
office of the Corporation is then located, to be specified in the notice of
such meeting.  If such meeting shall not be  called within twenty (20) days
after  the personal service of  such written request  upon the Secretary of
the Corporation, or within twenty  (20) days after the mailing of  the same
within the  Untied States of  America by  registered mail addressed  to the
Secretary of the Corporation  at its principal office, then the  holders of
records of at  least twenty  percent (20%)  of the  shares of  the Class  A
Cumulative Preferred Stock then outstanding may designate in writing one of
their numbers to  call such meeting at the expense  of the Corporation, and
such meeting may be called by such  person so designated in the manner  and
at  the place  above stated.   Any holder  of Class  A Cumulative Preferred
Stock so designated shall have access to the stock books of the Corporation
for the  purpose  of causing  a  meeting to  be  called pursuant  to  these
provisions.

At any meeting at which  the holders of Class A Cumulative  Preferred Stock
shall have the right to elect directors as provided in  subsection (2), the
presence, in person or by proxy, of  the holders of 33-1/3% of the Class  A
Cumulative Preferred  Stock  at the  time  outstanding shall  constitute  a
quorum.  At any such meeting or any adjournment thereof, (a) the absence of
a quorum  of the holders  of Class A  Cumulative Preferred Stock  shall not
prevent  the election of  directors other than  those to be  elected by the
holders of  Class A Cumulative Preferred  Stock voting as a  class, and the
absence of a quorum of holders of the shares entitled to vote for directors
other than  those  to be  elected  by the  holders  of Class  A  Cumulative
Preferred Stock  shall not  prevent the  election of  the  directors to  be
elected by  holders of Class A  Cumulative Preferred Stock, and  (b) in the

                                    -9-

                                     
absence  of a quorum of the holders  of Class A Cumulative Preferred Stock,
the  holders of a  majority of  such shares present  in person or  by proxy
shall  have power to adjourn from time to time the meeting for the election
of  the directors  which they, voting  as a  class, are  entitled to elect,
without notice other than announcement at the meeting, until a quorum shall
be present, and in  the absence of  a quorum of the  holders of the  shares
entitled  to vote for directors other than  those elected by the holders of
Class A Cumulative Preferred Stock, the holders of a majority of such other
shares present  in person or by proxy shall  have the power to adjourn from
time to time the meeting for the  election of the directors which they  are
entitled to elect, without  notice other than announcement at  the meeting,
until a quorum shall be present.

If the office of  any director elected by the holders of Class A Cumulative
Preferred Stock becomes vacant by reason of death, resignation, retirement,
disqualification, removal from office, or otherwise, the remaining director
elected by the  holders of Class A Cumulative Preferred  Stock may choose a
successor who  shall hold office for the unexpired term in respect of which
such vacancy occurred.

(j)   Limitation upon and Required Corporation Action Pending Retirement of
Preferred Stock - Until such time as the Corporation shall have redeemed or
otherwise  retired  and  cancelled  all  of  the  Preferred   Stock  issued
hereunder:

(i)    the  Corporation  will  not make  loans  or  advances  to  officers,
employees,  stockholders  or  others  except  in  the  ordinary  course  of
business;

(ii)   the Corporation  will furnish  annual audits  in  duplicate to  each
holder of 10% or more of the par value of the  outstanding Preferred Stock,
prepared by  a recognized and  duly licensed  certified public  accountant,

(k)   Additional Issues of Preferred Stock and Class A Cumulative Preferred
Stock and Earnings Coverage - Additional series of Preferred Stock or Class
A Cumulative Preferred  Stock may  be issued through  authorization by  the
Board of Directors of  the Corporation from time to time,  up to the amount
authorized  in  the Articles  of  Incorporation,  without the  approval  or
consent  of the  holders of  outstanding Common  Stock, Preferred  Stock or
Class A Cumulative  Preferred Stock, but only when the income available for
fixed charges of  the Corporation for any consecutive twelve  months out of
the  fifteen  months  immediately  preceding  the  date  of  issue  of  the
additional series  equals at least  one and one-half times  the annual bond
interest and amortization charges and  dividend charges on Preferred  Stock
and Class A Cumulative  Preferred Stock, including the dividend  charges on
the new series.

(l)  Payment  for Common  Stock - All  or any  of the Common  Stock of  the
Corporation, if sold, may be paid for in cash, but may also be paid  for in
property, labor or services at a just valuation to be fixed by the Board of
Directors  at  a meeting  called  for  that purpose.    Property, labor  or
services  may also be  purchased or paid  for with  Common Stock at  a just

                                    -10-

                                      
valuation of such property,  labor or services, to be fixed by the Board of
Directors of the Corporation at a  meeting called for such purpose.   In no
event shall such just valuation be less than par value.

of Common Stock  shall be required to be first offered to the then existing
stockholders of such class of Common Stock.

and in every  case of redemption of less than all of the outstanding shares
of  the 5% Cumulative Preferred  Stock, Series 1966,  the Corporation shall
first allocate to each holder of 5% or more of the then outstanding  shares
of such series  the same proportion as nearly as  practicable of the shares
to be redeemed  as the number of shares of such  series held by such holder
bears  to  all  shares  of  such  series  then  outstanding.    After  such
allocation, the remaining shares to  be redeemed may be selected pro  rata,
by lot,  or otherwise, at  the discretion  of the Board  of Directors  from
among shares held by the other holders of such series.

(iv)   Purchase Fund.   So  long as shares  of the  5% Cumulative Preferred
Stock, Series 1966, shall  be outstanding, the Corporation shall  set aside
as a reserve on the books of  the Corporation, which need not be funded,  a
Purchase Fund for  the 5% Cumulative Preferred Stock,  Series 1966, on July
1,  1967 and on July 1 in each  year thereafter, equal to the Purchase Fund
Obligation for such year  as hereinafter defined; provided that  the amount
so set aside shall be  less than the Purchase Fund Obligation to the extent
that the purchase of shares of 5% Cumulative  Preferred Stock, Series 1966,
as contemplated  shall be prohibited  in whole  or in part  at the  time by
applicable law, and further provided  that no amount shall be so  set aside
if the  Corporation is  in default in  the payment  of dividends on  the 5%
Cumulative Preferred Stock,  Series 1966,  or any shares  of stock  ranking

                                    -15-

                                     
senior to or  on a parity  with the 5%  Cumulative Preferred Stock,  Series
1966.  The requirement for a Purchase  Fund in any year shall be deemed  to
be fully  satisfied to the extent that the Corporation shall have set aside
a  Purchase Fund,  notwithstanding that  the total  amount expended  in the
purchase of shares in such  year shall be less because insufficient  offers
to sell were received.  

The Purchase Fund  Obligation for a given  year shall be  $69,600 increased
by: (a) an amount equal  to accrued and unpaid dividends on 6,960 shares of
5% Cumulative Preferred  Stock, Series 1966,  to the  first date fixed  for
acceptance of offers  and payment for shares; (b) any  balance of less than
$5,000 from the  preceding year as hereinafter provided;  and (c) an amount
equal to  the excess,  if  any, of  the Purchase  Fund  Obligation for  the
immediately  preceding year over the  amount set aside  in such immediately
preceding year.

At any  time after  July 1, 1967,  so long as  any 5%  Cumulative Preferred
Stock,  Series 1966,  shall be  outstanding, no dividend  shall be  paid or
declared  or other distribution made on outstanding shares of stock ranking
junior with respect to either the  payment of dividends or the distribution
of   assets  upon  the  liquidation,  dissolution  or  winding  up  of  the
Corporation  to the 5% Cumulative  Preferred Stock, Series  1966, nor shall
any sums be applied to the purchase, redemption or other retirement of such
junior stock  unless either (a) on  the immediately preceding  July 1 there
has been set aside an amount equal to the Purchase Fund Obligation for such
date; or  (b) subsequent  to the  immediately preceding  July 1,  a Special
Purchase Fund shall have  been set aside.  Such a Special Purchase Fund may
be set aside at the  discretion of the Board  of Directors at any time  and
shall be in an  amount equal to any excess of the  Purchase Fund Obligation
for the  immediately preceding  July 1, over  the amount then  actually set
aside and shall otherwise be subject to the same terms and restrictions and
applied in  the same  manner as  a Purchase  Fund with the  first offer  to
purchase being  made to each  holder of shares  of 5%  Cumulative Preferred
Stock, Series  1966, of  record  at the  close of  business  on the  second
business day  next succeeding  the establishment  of such  Special Purchase
Fund.

The Purchase  Fund for any given  year shall be applied  by the Corporation
acting for  itself or  through  any transfer  agent for  the 5%  Cumulative
Preferred Stock, Series 1966, or through  any other duly appointed agent as 
follows:


(x)  If the Purchase Fund for such year shall be in an amount of less  than
$5,000, it shall be dissolved and removed from the books of the Corporation
and the Purchase Fund Obligation for the following year shall be  increased
by a like amount (as provided hereinabove).

(y)  If the Purchase Fund for such  year shall be in an amount of $5,000 or
more, the  Corporation shall promptly mail  to each holder of  shares of 5%
Cumulative Preferred Stock, Series 1966, as such holder shall appear in the
Corporation's stock  transfer records at the close of business on July 1 of
such  year, an  offer to  purchase such  shares of 5%  Cumulative Preferred
Stock, Series  1966, as such holder  may offer it upon  the following terms

                                    -16-

                                     
and conditions:

(1)  Subject to the limitation contained in Subparagraph (y)(3) hereof, the
Corporation shall purchase  from each holder as many shares  as such holder
shall  offer to it on  or before the  close of business on  July 31 of such
year and shall make payment therefor on August 1 of such year.

(2)  The price at  which  such shares  shall be purchased shall  be $10 per
share plus dividends accrued and unpaid thereon to August 1 of such year.

(3)  The Corporation  may purchase  from each holder offering  shares up to
but  not in excess of the number of whole shares that may be purchased with
such  holder's  allocable  portion  of  the  Purchase  Fund  determined  by
multiplying the amount  in the  Purchase Fund by  the percentage which  the
number of shares so held of  record by such holder represents of  the total
number  of shares  of  5% Cumulative  Preferred  Stock, Series  1966,  then
outstanding.

(4)  Each  offer to purchase shall set forth these terms and conditions and
shall also state  the maximum number of shares purchasable  from the holder
to whom it is addressed.

(z)  If any offers have been accepted pursuant to  Paragraph (y) hereof and
if  any amount  thereafter remains  in the  Purchase Fund,  the Corporation
shall on or  promptly after August  1 of such year  mail to each  holder of
record of 5% or more of the shares of 5% Cumulative Preferred Stock, Series
1966, at the close of business on August  1 of such year a second offer  to
purchase such shares of 5% Cumulative Preferred Stock, Series 1966, as such
holder  may offer to sell  and such second offer to  purchase shall be upon
the following terms and conditions:

(1)  To  the extent permitted by the amount remaining in the Purchase Fund,
the  Corporation shall  purchase  as many  shares  as possible  from  those
offered to it on or before the close of  business on August 31 of such year
and shall make payment therefor on September 1 of such year.

(2)   The price at  which such shares shall  be purchased shall  be $10 per
share plus dividends accrued and unpaid thereon to September 1 of such year
(the  additional  amount  of   accrued  dividends  to  be  paid   form  the
Corporation's general funds and not from the Purchase Fund).

(3)   Should offers be  received for more shares than can be  purchased and
paid  for  with  the  amount  then  remaining in  the  Purchase  Fund,  the
Corporation shall accept such offers pro  rata as nearly as possible in the
proportion  that the number of  shares held of  record on such  August 1 by
each such holder bears to the total number of such shares so held of record
by  all holders  offering to  sell shares  pursuant to  this  Paragraph (z)
provided that no purchase shall be made of less than a full share.

(4)   Should  the allocation made  pursuant to  Subparagraph (z)(3)  to any
holder  exceed the  number of  shares offered by  such holder,  such holder
shall be  allocated shares  to  be purchased  to the  full  amount of  such
holder's offer and such excess shall be then reallocated on a similar basis

                                    -17-

                                     
among the remaining  holders who  have offered shares,  and this  procedure
shall be repeated until no excess remains.

(5)  Each such  offer to purchase shall set forth  the terms and conditions
and  shall also state the total number of  shares which can be purchased by
the total balance then in the Purchase Fund.

The Board  of Directors  shall have  full discretion from  time to  time to
prescribe and regulate,  subject to  the provisions herein  set forth,  the
procedure  to be  followed  in the  surrender  of certificates  for  shares
offered, endorsement  or assignment thereof, method of payment for accepted
shares, giving of notice and any other matter not herein expressly provided
for, and  may in its discretion  require that offers be  accompanied by the
certificates for such shares  and/or by satisfactory evidence of  the right
of the holder thereof to sell the same to the Corporation or may waive such
requirements.    Expenses  of  the  Purchase  Fund  shall be  paid  by  the
Corporation out of its general funds and not out of the Purchase Fund.

Each Purchase Fund  shall be dissolved  and removed from  the books of  the
Corporation after all  shares, if any, offered and accepted  pursuant to it
have been purchased and paid for as herein contemplated.

(d)   100,000 shares  of the  Class A Cumulative  Preferred Stock  shall be
designated  as 8.25% Class A  Cumulative Preferred Stock,  Series 1982, and
shall have the rights and preferences as follows:

(i)  Dividend  Rate.   The rate of  dividend payable on  the 8.25% Class  A
Cumulative  Preferred  Stock, Series  1982, shall  be  $8.25 per  share per
annum, payable quarter-yearly on  the first days of March,  June, September
and  December in  each year,  to shareholders  of record on  the respective
dates, not exceeding sixty (60) days preceding such dividend payment dates,
fixed  from time  to  time for  that  purpose by  the  Board of  Directors.
Dividends shall commence to accrue from the date of issue of such shares of
8.25% Class A Cumulative Preferred Stock, Series 1982.

(ii)  Liquidation Rights.   The amount to be  paid to holders of  the 8.25%
Class  A  Cumulative Preferred  Stock,  Series 1982,  upon  any involuntary
liquidation, dissolution  or winding-up of the Corporation shall be $100.00
per share plus accrued dividends  to the date of distribution.   The amount
to  be paid  to holders of  the 8.25%  Class A  Cumulative Preferred Stock,
Series  1982, upon any voluntary liquidation,  dissolution or winding-up of
the Corporation shall be  equal to the amount per share at  which shares of
8.25%  Class A  Cumulative  Preferred Stock,  Series  1982, could  then  be
redeemed  under  the  provisions  of  section  (iii)  hereof  plus  accrued
dividends to the date of distribution.

(iii)  Redemption Price.  The  shares of 8.25% Class A Cumulative Preferred
Stock,  Series 1982,  shall be  redeemable at  the option  of the  Board of
Directors  at any time  or from  time to  time, in whole  or in  part, upon

1983                106.19            1993                102.75
1984                105.84            1994                102.41

1986                105.16            1996                101.72

1988                104.47            1998                101.03

1991                103.44

and thereafter at $100.00 per share, plus, in each case,  accrued dividends
to  the  redemption date  of shares  redeemed;  provided, however,  that no
shares of the 8.25% Class A Cumulative Preferred Stock, Series 1982, may be
redeemed  at the  option  of the  Corporation prior  to  December 1,  1987,
directly or indirectly,  from the proceeds of,  or in anticipation of,  any
refunding operation involving the issuance of any bonds, notes or evidences
of indebtedness or the issuance of any shares of stock  ranking prior to or
on a parity with the 8.25% Class A Cumulative Preferred Stock, Series 1982,
if such indebtedness or stock has a cost to the  Corporation (calculated in
accordance  with accepted  financial  principles) of  less  than 8.25%  per
annum.  In  case of  a redemption of  less than  all of the  8.25% Class  A
Cumulative  Preferred Stock,  Series  1982,  the  particular shares  to  be
redeemed shall be,  to the nearest full share, a  proportionate part of the
holdings of  each holder  of shares of  8.25% Class A  Cumulative Preferred
Stock, Series  1982; provided,  however, that  less than  all of  the 8.25%
Class A Cumulative Preferred Stock, Series 1982, may be redeemed only after
full  cumulative  dividends  upon  the  Cumulative  Preferred  Shares  then
outstanding shall  have  bee  paid for  all  past  quarter-yearly  dividend
periods and  after or concurrently with making payment of, or declaring and
setting apart for  payment, the  full dividend on  all outstanding Class  A
Cumulative  Preferred Stock  for the  then current  quarter-yearly dividend
period.

(iv)  Sinking Fund.  As and for a mandatory sinking fund for the redemption
of shares of 8.25% Class A  Cumulative Preferred Stock, Series 1982,  after
full  cumulative dividends on the 8.25% Class A Cumulative Preferred Stock,
Series  1982,  have been  set  aside  for all  past  dividend  periods, the
Corporation  shall, on December 1 in  each year commencing with December 1,
1983 to and  including December 1, 2002, from  any legally available funds,
redeem  at  the  sinking  fund  redemption  price  hereinafter  fixed   the
applicable  number of shares of  8.25% Class A  Cumulative Preferred Stock,
Series  1982, as  follows: 1983  through 1987,  2,000 shares;  1988 through
1992, 4,000 shares; 1993 through 1997, 6,000 shares; and 1998 through 2002,
8,000  shares.    The obligation  of  the  Corporation  hereunder shall  be
cumulative  so that if the  Corporation if prevented  by any restriction in
its Article  of Incorporation,  as amended,  or by  any  other reason  from
redeeming the shares which it is obligated to redeem on any December 1, the

                                    -19-

                                     
Corporation  shall set  apart  an amount  for  the mandatory  sinking  fund
sufficient  to redeem  the  number  of  shares  which  the  Corporation  is
obligated  to redeem hereunder as  soon as practicable  and the Corporation
shall  not declare any dividend on, or  make any payment or distribution in
respect  of, any stock  junior to  the 8.25%  Class A  Cumulative Preferred
Stock,  Series 1982,  while any  payment to  the sinking  fund shall  be in
arrears.  In  addition to  the amounts  required to  be set  aside by  this
section, the Corporation  may at its option  in each year,  commencing with
the year 1983  to and including 2002, set aside as part of the sinking fund
a sum not exceeding the amount required in that year  for the redemption of
shares  of 8.25%  Class A  Cumulative Preferred  Stock, Series  1982, which
amount shall  be applied on  December 1 of that  year to the  redemption of
additional shares of 8.25% Class A Cumulative Preferred Stock, Series 1982,
at the sinking fund  redemption price; provided, however, that the right to
make such optional payments shall not be cumulative and such payments shall
not exceed $3,000,000 in the aggregate.  The  sinking fund redemption price
for  shares of  8.25%  Class A  Cumulative  Preferred Stock,  Series  1982,
redeemed pursuant to this section (iv) shall be $100.00 per share, plus, in
each case, dividends accrued to the date of redemption.

Shares  of the  8.25%  Class A  Cumulative  Preferred Stock,  Series  1982,
redeemed pursuant to  mandatory or  optional payments to  the sinking  fund
shall be  called for redemption  and redeemed  in the manner  set forth  in
section (d)  of Article IV.   Shares of 8.25% Class  A Cumulative Preferred
Stock,  Series 1982, redeemed through  operation of the  sinking fund shall
be, to the nearest full share, a proportionate part of the holdings of each
holder of shares of 8.25% Class A Cumulative Preferred Stock,  Series 1982.
In  no  event,  however, shall  any  shares  of  8.25% Class  A  Cumulative
Preferred  Stock, Series  1982, be  called for  redemption pursuant  to the
sinking fund until full dividends accrued  on all outstanding shares of all
series of Class A Cumulative Preferred Stock  of the Corporation shall have
been paid or declared and set apart for payment for all past quarter-yearly
dividend periods ending on or before the redemption date.

(v)    No Conversion  Rights.    The shares  of  8.25%  Class A  Cumulative
Preferred Stock, Series 1982, shall not be convertible into other shares or
securities of the Corporation.

(vi)   Voting Rights.  In  addition to the  voting rights conferred  on all
series of Class A Cumulative Preferred  Stock by subsection (2) of  section
(i) of  Article IV, at any meeting of shareholders of the Corporation every
holder of the 8.25% Class A Cumulative Preferred Stock shall be entitled to
cast one  vote, on  each matter  on which shareholders  of record  shall be
entitled to  vote, for each share  of such stock standing  in such holder's
name on the record  books of the Corporation  on the record date  fixed for
the  determination of  stockholders  entitled  to  vote  at  such  meeting.
Holders of the 8.25% Class A Cumulative Preferred Stock shall vote together
with the holders of the Preferred Stock and Common Stock and not by classes
or series, except when  and as may  be otherwise required  by law or  these
Articles of Incorporation.

entitled to  vote  pursuant to  the Certificate  of Incorporation,  except,
however, as used  in Bylaw  Number 65  pertaining to the  maintenance of  a
stock ledger;  and wherever in  these Bylaws the  word "stock" is  used, it
shall  be construed to  mean stock possessing voting  power pursuant to the

39,  61, 62, 63,  64 and 65  pertaining generally to  the issuance of stock

             good faith, if  such person (1) exercised  or used
             the same degree of care and skill as a prudent man
             or  woman would have  exercised or used  under the
             circumstances in  the conduct  of his  or her  own
             affairs,  or  (2)  took or  omitted  to  take such


                                    -10-


             action  in reliance on  advice of counsel  for the
             Corporation or upon statements made or information
             furnished  by   officers  or   employees  of   the
             Corporation which he or she had reasonable grounds
             to believe.

     (b)  Indemnification

             (1)  Actions  Other Than Those by or  in the Right
             of  the   Corporation.    The   Corporation  shall
             indemnify any person  who was or is a  party or is
             threatened to be  made a party to  any threatened,
             pending or  completed action, suit  or proceeding,
             whether   civil,   criminal,   administrative   or
             investigative (other than  an action by or  in the
             right  of the Corporation)  by reason of  the fact
             that  he or she is or was a director or officer of
             the  Corporation,  or  is or  was  serving  at the
             request  of  the  Corporation  as  a  director  or
             officer of another corporation, partnership, joint
             venture,  trust   or  other   enterprise,  against
             expenses (including  attorneys' fees),  judgments,
             fines and amounts paid in settlement  actually and
             reasonably incurred  by him  or her  in connection
             with such action, suit or proceeding if  he or she
             acted  in good  faith and  in a  manner he  or she
             reasonably believed to be in or not opposed to the
             best interests of  the Corporation (or such  other
             corporation or organization), and, with respect to
             any  criminal   action  or   proceeding,  had   no
             reasonable cause to believe his or her conduct was
             unlawful.   The termination of any action, suit or
             proceeding   by   judgment,   order,   settlement,
             conviction,  or upon a  plea of nolo  contendre or
             its  equivalent,  shall not,  of itself,  create a
             presumption  that the person  did not act  in good
             faith and in  a manner which he  or she reasonably
             believed  to  be in  or  not opposed  to  the best
             interests of the Corporation, and, with respect to
             any criminal action  or proceeding, had reasonable
             cause  to  believe  that his  or  her  conduct was
             unlawful.

             (2)  Action by or in the Right of the Corporation.
             The Corporation shall indemnify any person who was
             or is a party  or is threatened to be made a party
             to any threatened, pending  or completed action or
             suit  by or  in  the right  of the  Corporation to
             procure a judgment  in its favor by reason  of the
             fact  that he  or  she  is or  was  a director  or
             officer,  of the Corporation, or is or was serving
             at the request of the Corporation as a director or
             officer of another corporation, partnership, joint
             venture,   trust  or   other  enterprise   against


                                    -11-
                                       

             expenses (including attorneys'  fees) actually and
             reasonably  incurred by him  or her  in connection
             with the defense  or settlement of such  action or
             suit  if he or  she acted in  good faith  and in a
             manner  he or she reasonably  believed to be in or
             not   opposed  to   the  best  interests   of  the
             Corporation   (or   such  other   corporation   or
             organization) and  except that  no indemnification
             shall be  made in respect  of any claim,  issue or
             matter as  to which  such person  shall have  been
             adjudged to be liable for negligence or misconduct
             in  the performance  of  his or  her  duty to  the
             Corporation   (or   such  other   corporation   or
             organization) unless and  only to the extent  that
             the court in which such action or suit was brought
             shall determine upon application that, despite the
             adjudication of liability  but in view of  all the
             circumstances of  the case, such  person is fairly
             and  reasonably  entitled  to indemnity  for  such
             expenses which such court shall deem proper.

             (3)        Successful     Defense    of    Action.
             Notwithstanding,  and without  limitation of,  any
             other provision  of this Section 73, to the extent
             that  a director or officer of the Corporation has
             been  successful on  the  merits  or otherwise  in

             to in paragraph (1) or  (2) of this Section 73, or
             in  defense of any claim, issue or matter therein,
             he  or she shall  be indemnified  against expenses

             under  paragraph (1)  or (2)  of  this Section  73

             applicable standard of  conduct set forth  in said
             paragraph.  Such  determination shall be made  (i)

             advance of the final  disposition of such  action,
             suit  or proceeding as  authorized may be  paid by
             the  Corporation   in   advance   of   the   final
             disposition of such action, suit or proceeding  as
             authorized  by  the  Board  of  Directors  in  the
             specific  case  upon  receipt  of  a  satisfactory
             undertaking by  or on  behalf of  the director  or
             officer  to repay  such  amount  unless  it  shall
             ultimately  be  determined  that  he  or   she  is
             entitled to  be indemnified by the  Corporation as
             authorized in this Section 73.

             liability provided by this Section 73 shall not be
             deemed  exclusive of  any other  indemnifications,
             rights or  limitations of liability  to which  any
             person may be entitled under any bylaw, agreement,
             vote of  stockholders or  disinterested directors,
             or  otherwise, either as to action in his official
             capacity or as to action in another capacity while
             holding office, and  they shall continue  although
             such person has ceased to be a director or officer
             and shall  inure  to the  benefit  of his  or  her
             heirs, executors and administrators.
