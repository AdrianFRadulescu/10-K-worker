PART I

ITEM 1.  BUSINESS.

COMPANY OVERVIEW


Since its initial public offering in 1986, when it operated 208 convenience
stores, the Company has expanded, primarily through three major acquisitions of
groups of stores, including the acquisition of 141 stores from Getty Petroleum
Corp. ("Getty") in December 1991.  The Company currently operates 414
convenience stores in Pennsylvania, Virginia, New York, New Jersey, Delaware and
Maryland, of which 300 sell gasoline.  Following the acquisition of stores from
Getty, the Company closed certain redundant and underperforming stores.  Most of
the stores are located in small towns and rural locations where costs of
operations are generally lower than in urban areas.  Most Company stores located
in urban and suburban areas have been acquired and are generally leased on a
long-term basis.

The size of the Company's stores ranges from approximately 1,200 to 3,300 square
feet, with newly constructed stores having over 3,000 square feet.  Typically, 
the stores offer a complete line of over 3,000 popular consumer items.  In
addition, the Company offers products designed to increase store traffic, such
as branded fast foods as well as services, including lottery tickets, free check
cashing and automated teller machines ("ATMs").  The Company allows store
management to tailor the merchandise mix to fit the needs of that store's
community.  The Company believes that this results in customer loyalty and a
more stable profit margin.

The following table shows the geographic distribution of the Company's stores as
of September 30, 1995:

The Company commenced its convenience store operations in 1972 and was
incorporated in Delaware in 1977.  In 1986, the Company's shares were
distributed in a tax-free spin-off to the holders of the stock of Unico
Corporation, formerly the Company's parent.  The Company's executive offices are
located at 477 East Beaver Avenue, State College, Pennsylvania 16801-5690 and
its phone number is (814) 234-6000.


THE CONVENIENCE STORE INDUSTRY


The convenience store industry is a retail service-oriented industry.  It is
distinguished from other retail businesses by its emphasis on location and 

                                        3

<PAGE>
convenience and a commitment to customers who need to purchase items quickly at 
extended hours.  Convenience stores feature a wide variety of items, including 
groceries, dairy products, tobacco products, beverages, prepared and self-
service fast foods and health and beauty aids, and many sell gasoline on a self-
service basis.  Stores are generally designed with ample customer parking and
quick checkout procedures to maximize convenience, as well as to encourage
impulse buying of high margin items.


The convenience store industry is extremely fragmented.  Industry sources report
that there were 93,200 stores in the United States at the end of 1994, of which
the six largest convenience store chains combined for about 9% of the total
stores in operation.  Currently, there are many external forces exerting
considerable pressure on owners of independent and small convenience store
chains.  Two of the major forces include the need to comply with environmental
regulations for underground storage tanks and the general weakness in the dairy
industry.  The large capital expenditures required to comply with environmental
regulations are also affecting many operators of gasoline service stations.  As
a result of these forces, there has been and continues to be significant
opportunities for consolidation in the industry.


Recent competitive trends across many retail sectors are having a positive
influence on the convenience store industry as it changes the typical
convenience store's merchandise mix in reaction to market conditions and
customer preferences.  In addition, convenience stores compete not only with
other convenience stores but now also with gasoline distributors which have
converted to convenience stores.  To compete for a broader customer base,
convenience stores are adding prepared foods, new services and improving store
layouts to attract new customers.  Overall, industry sources report that
convenience store industry sales rose 8.5% and 8.7% in 1993 and 1994,
respectively, compared to a 6.3% and 7.8% increase in total U.S. retail sales
for the same periods.  As consumer preferences and government regulations put
pressure on tobacco sales, convenience store operators are improving gasoline
pumping facilities and installing branded fast-food outlets and ATMs.  In
addition, the convenience store industry has aggressively closed or remodeled
under-performing stores.  Over the last two years, the industry has either
constructed, remodeled or closed about a third of the U.S. convenience store
population.


STRATEGY


Management believes that the Company is uniquely positioned to take advantage of
current trends in the convenience store industry.  Its strategy is designed to 
(i) expand the number of store locations by acquiring chains of convenience
stores and, on a limited basis, through internal growth and (ii) increase
customer traffic, sales volume and profit margins.  Key elements of the
Company's strategy include the following:


        FOCUS ON RURAL AND SMALL-TOWN LOCATIONS.  Most of the Company's stores
are located in small towns and rural locations where costs of operations and
levels of competition are generally lower than in urban and suburban markets. 
The Company's stores in these rural markets often serve as the community's
"general store", providing the convenience of one-stop shopping for customers. 
 
                                        4

<PAGE>
As a result, the Company is able to provide a wide range of services and
products at favorable margins.  In addition, there tends to be significantly
less employee turnover at the Company's rural and small-town stores.


        MAINTAIN DISCIPLINED EXPANSION PROGRAM.  The Company believes that there
are many acquisition opportunities in its current and adjacent geographic market
areas.  The Company has had and continues to maintain an expansion program which
has increased the number of convenience stores it operates through acquisitions
of existing chains and construction of new stores.  Potential acquisition
candidates are carefully evaluated by the Company.  In particular, before
pursuing an acquisition, the Company takes into account whether an acquisition
candidate is in compliance with applicable environmental laws and the level of
capital expenditures required for environmental compliance and to bring the
stores up to the Company's standards.


        INSTALL BRANDED FAST-FOOD UNITS.  The Company has been actively adding
fast-food units such as Burger King, Arby's and Blimpie to certain stores.  The
Company believes that the recognition associated with these names increases foot
traffic and attracts new customers.  In those stores that have added branded
fast-food units, merchandise sales have increased approximately 20 to 25
percent, including fast-food sales, and margins have increased approximately
four to five percent.  To date, the Company is operating three Burger King
units, five Arby's and 21 Blimpies.  Of its current stores, approximately 200
have the potential to profitably support fast-food units.  The Company plans to
add 25 to 30 fast-food units per year in its existing and newly constructed
stores.


        BUILD HIGH-VOLUME GASOLINE PUMPING STATIONS.  The Company has been
replacing its traditional gasoline pumping stations with state-of-the-art,
multi-pump high-volume pumping stations, which include on-pump credit card
readers.  The new pumps are spaced farther apart and can dispense all grades of
gasoline at a single pump, thereby enabling several customers to fuel their
automobiles at the same time.  Based on the Company's experience to date, the
introduction of these pumping stations has resulted in more than 50 percent
additional gallons of gasoline being sold per store.  In addition, the increased
number of gasoline customers served by these new high-volume pumping stations is
expected to generate additional customer traffic and merchandise sales.  The
Company has installed twenty high-volume gasoline pumping stations to date and
140 of the Company's current stores have the necessary space for these new high-
volume stations.


        ADDITIONAL SERVICES.  The Company offers various services at its stores,
including the sale of lottery tickets, free check cashing and payment of utility
bills.  In addition, the Company has entered into an agreement to add ATMs to 
the Company's stores.  The Company anticipates installing at least 155 ATMs to 
its stores by early 1997.  The Company believes that the addition of these ATMs,
like the addition of branded fast-food installations and high-volume gasoline
pumping stations, will serve to increase merchandise and gasoline sales.

MERCHANDISING AND MARKETING


The Company's merchandising and marketing programs are designed to promote
convenience through store location, hours of operation, parking, customer 
service, product selection and checkout procedures.  Store hours are intended to
meet customer needs and the characteristics of the community in which each store
is located.  Approximately one-half of the Company's stores are open 24 hours
per day, while the majority of the remaining stores are open from 6:00 a.m. to
12:00 midnight.  To alleviate checkout congestion, many of the Company's
products and services, such as certain prepared fast food, fountain beverages
and gasoline, are sold on a self-service basis.  Most Company stores provide
parking for customers.


Uni-Marts has a separate merchandising and marketing department which develops
and implements promotional and advertising programs, sometimes in conjunction
with suppliers.  Television, radio and newspaper advertisements are used to 
promote the Company's name and image.  The Company maintains an employee
training program for all employees which emphasizes the importance of service to
customers and the development of merchandising and marketing skills for its
store managers and store personnel. 


        CONVENIENCE STORE MERCHANIDSE SALES.  The Company's stores include dry
grocery items, health and beauty aids, newspapers and magazines, lottery
tickets, dairy products, candy, frozen foods, beverages, tobacco products, 
delicatessen foods, fountain drinks and hot coffee.  In recent years,  
the Company has emphasized new merchandise sales such as prepared foods and
branded fast foods to increase sales volume and customer traffic.  In addition,
the Company continues to add customer services, such as ATMs, check cashing,
payment of utility bills and lottery ticket sales, all of which are designed to
increase customer traffic.  In addition, some stores offer a video rental
program, as well as a variety of prepared and self-service fast foods, including
freshly made sandwiches, hot dogs, pizza, chicken, freshly baked goods, frozen
sandwiches, nachos and soups.


        As part of the Company's strategy to increase branded fast foods, in
fiscal year 1994, the Company entered into an agreement with Blimpie
International ("Blimpie") to become an area developer (franchisor) for Blimpie
Subs and Salads restaurants in Pennsylvania and western New York.  During fiscal
year 1995, the Company added Blimpie branded subs and salads installations at 13
of its stores.  In addition, in fiscal year 1995, the Company added two Burger
King and three Arby's installations.  The Company intends to add more Blimpie,
Burger King, and Arby's fast-food installations.


        CONVENIENCE STORE GASOLINE SALES.  Convenience store operations and
merchandise sales are enhanced by self-service gasoline facilities, which the
Company plans to include in as many new locations as possible and to add to
existing stores when feasible.  Sales of gasoline products at the Company's
stores are affected by wholesale and retail price volatility, competition and 
marketing decisions.  At September 30, 1995, the Company had 300 locations
offering unleaded gasoline, with 150 of these locations also offering kerosene. 
All are branded self-service units with 287 offering Getty gasoline pursuant to
a petroleum supply agreement, and the balance offer other major brands.

COMPANY OPERATIONS


        STORE MANAGEMENT.  Each Company-operated store is managed by a store
manager.  Store managers are compensated by salary, as well as incentive 
compensation programs based on in-store sales volume and profitability.  All
Company stores are divided into groups of six to eleven stores by geographic
area.  Each group is managed by a store supervisor.  A regional manager is
responsible for a number of groups and their store supervisors.  The regional
managers report directly to the Director of Operations, who oversees the day-to-
day operations of the stores.  Managers, supervisors and regional managers are
compensated through incentive programs which provide for quarterly bonuses based
on increased profitability of the stores.  The number of full-time and part-time
employees per store depends on the sales volume of the store and its hours of
operation.


        FRANCHISES.  The Company has 39 franchised stores which operate under
various franchise agreements.  Under all franchise agreements, the franchisee
pays a royalty, which varies depending upon the agreement and whether the
Company or the franchisee owns the convenience food store equipment.  The
royalty is based on the store's merchandise sales volume.


        As part of its services to 28 franchise locations, the Company provides
accounting services, merchandising and advertising assistance, store layout and
design guidance, supplier and product selection and ongoing operational
assistance.  These franchisees are required to use the same internal control
systems that the Company uses for the stores it operates.  The Company's
financial statements include the sales and costs of sales of these 28 franchised
stores.  The Company does not provide these services for the 11 franchise
locations formerly franchised by Getty.  The Company has periodically closed 
franchised stores and does not intend to grant new franchises except in
connection with new acquisitions or in other special circumstances.


DISTRIBUTION AND SUPPLY


All 414 stores are serviced at least weekly by vendors.  The Company does not
distribute products to its stores itself.  In order to minimize costs and
facilitate deliveries, the Company utilizes a single wholesale distributor for
most products, pursuant to a five-year supply agreement.  The Company believes
that it could easily replace this distributor with one or more distributors. 
Certain products, such as bakery items, dairy products, snacks, soft drinks,
magazines and perishable products, are distributed by wholesale route
salespeople.  As part of the sale of its dairy operation, the Company entered
into a 10-year supply agreement with the purchaser which provides for the
Company's purchase of all dairy products sold at its Pennsylvania stores.


In connection with the 1991 acquisition of the Getty stores, the Company and
Getty entered into a five-year gasoline supply agreement pursuant to which Getty
supplies gasoline products to substantially all of the Company's convenience
stores offering self-service gasoline.  The Company is currently negotiating an
extension of the petroleum supply agreement with Getty.


                                        7

MANAGEMENT CONTROLS AND INFORMATION SYSTEMS


The Company is developing an internal automation system which includes point-of-
sale ("POS") scanning.  The system is designed to improve the timeliness and
accuracy of management information, reduce paperwork at the store level and
enhance cash, pricing and inventory controls.  As of September 30, 1995, 
installation of this new POS scanning system was complete in 14 stores, with
plans to add approximately 35 more during fiscal year 1996.


The Company utilizes its current computer systems for inventory and accounting
control, financial record-keeping and management reporting allowing management
to monitor closely and evaluate store operations.  The Company's computer 
systems are also programmed to identify variances from budgeted amounts by store
on a monthly and year-to-date basis.  In addition, profit and loss statements by
store compare the current year's results for the month and year-to-date to the
previous year's comparable periods. 


Store managers are responsible for placing orders for grocery, tobacco, frozen
food and non-food items directly into the central computer system of the
Company's wholesale supplier.  The computer systems are programmed to compare 
current orders with historic order levels and to reject orders which appear to
be incorrect.  Orders and receiving reports are reviewed by store supervisors.
Invoices are reviewed and compared to receiving reports by the Company's
accounting personnel and are paid centrally.


The Company's inventory control system is designed to ensure that stores are
adequately stocked, inventories are maintained at levels which minimize carrying
costs and slow-moving items are identified.  As part of the inventory control
system, store management personnel conduct approximately 12 physical inventories
at each store per year. The physical inventory, coupled with the computer
systems, enables the Company to monitor each store's operating performance on a
continuing basis.  In addition, the Company's internal audit department conducts
periodic inventories at a sampling of stores and reports the results to the
Audit Committee of the Company's Board.


The Company believes that its automated accounting and inventory control systems
provide the information required for management decisions and expense control.  


The Company believes that its existing and planned systems and controls can
accommodate significant expansion in the number of Company stores.


COMPETITION


The convenience store industry is highly competitive, fragmented and
regionalized.  It is characterized by a few large companies, some medium-sized
companies, such as the Company, and many small independent companies.  Several
competitors are substantially larger and have greater resources than the
Company.  The Company's primary competitors include national chains such as A-
Plus Mini-Markets and Seven-Eleven and regional chains such as Sheetz, WaWa, 

                                        8

<PAGE>
Stop-N-Go, Convenient Food Mart, Turkey Hill, Coastal and Co/Go.  The Company
also competes with other convenience stores, small supermarkets, grocery stores
and major and independent gasoline distributors who have converted units to
convenience stores.


Competition for gasoline sales is based on price and location.  The Company
competes primarily with self-service gasoline stations operated by independent
dealers and major oil companies in addition to other convenience stores.


ENVIRONMENTAL COMPLIANCE AND REGULATION


The Company's gasoline operations are subject to federal, state and local
environmental laws and regulations primarily relating to underground storage 
tanks.  The United States Environmental Protection Agency (the "EPA") has
established standards for owners and operators of underground storage tanks 
("USTs") relating to, among other things: (i) maintaining leak detection
systems; (ii) upgrading UST systems; (iii) implementing corrective action in
response to releases; (iv) closing out-of-use USTs to prevent future releases;
(v) maintaining appropriate records; and (vi) maintaining evidence of financial
responsibility for corrective action and compensating third parties for bodily
injury and property damage resulting from UST releases.  All states in which the
Company operates also have adopted these regulatory programs.


Under current federal and certain state regulatory programs, the Company is
obligated to upgrade or replace all non-complying underground storage tanks it
owns or operates to meet corrosion protection and overfill/spill containment
standards by 1998.  The Company has evaluated each of its stores which sell
gasoline to determine the type of expenditures required to comply with these and
other requirements under the federal and state UST regulatory programs.


Management believes that the Company is currently in material compliance with
all applicable federal and state laws and regulations.  The Company has spent
substantial amounts of money to upgrade all of its underground storage tanks to
meet the applicable standards and requirements and intends to expend $2.8
million over the next three years to maintain compliance.  The Company has
adopted a program to ensure that new gasoline installations comply with federal
and state regulations and that existing locations are upgraded if required under
these regulations.  For a discussion of the capital expenditures planned for 
environmental compliance, see "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial
Condition and Results of Operations."


GOVERNMENTAL REGULATION


In addition to the laws and regulations referred to under "Environmental
Compliance and Regulation," certain aspects of the Company's business are
governed by federal, state and local statutes.  As a franchisor, the Company is
also subject to federal and state laws governing franchising, which include,
among other matters, the commencement and termination of franchises.

Of the Company's 414 convenience store locations, 122 are owned by the Company,
12 are leased from affiliated parties and 280 are leased from unaffiliated
parties.  Most leases are for initial terms of five to ten years with renewal  
terms of five years available at the Company's option.  Under most leases, the
Company is responsible for the payment of insurance, taxes and maintenance.  Of
the leased locations, 11 are subleased to franchisees.  Of the 280 stores leased
from unaffiliated parties, 118 were leased from Getty in December 1991.  These
leases expire in December 1996.  The Company is currently negotiating with Getty
an extension of these leases.  The Company also owns five gasoline service
stations which are leased to unaffiliated operators.  As of September 30, 1995,
the Company had no stores under construction.


The Company's store leases expire as follows:

Common Stock is Chemical Mellon Shareholder Services, L.L.C., Ridgefield Park,
New Jersey.  As of December 1, 1995, the Company had 6,377,474 shares of its 
Common Stock outstanding.


Set forth below is a table which shows the high and low sale prices as reflected
on the American Stock Exchange and dividends paid on Common Stock for each
quarter in the two most recent fiscal years.

Effective January 1995, the Company elected to increase the quarterly dividends
on its Common Stock to the rate of $.0275 per share.  However, there is no
assurance of future dividends because they are at the discretion of the
Company's Board of Directors and are dependent on future earnings, capital
requirements and financial condition.  In addition, certain debt agreements may
restrict the Company's ability to declare and pay dividends on Common Stock. 
The amount of retained earnings available for such dividends at September 30,
1995 was $5,108,200.

ITEM 7.  MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND
         RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.


The Company's revenues are derived primarily from sales of merchandise and
gasoline at its 414 convenience stores.  In recent years the sale of gasoline
has become an increasingly significant part of the Company's revenues.  Gasoline
sales as a percentage of total revenues have increased from 38.5% in fiscal year
1993 to 40.5% in fiscal year 1994 to 43.9% in fiscal year 1995.  Average
gasoline sales per store, for stores open two full years, have increased from
approximately $399,000 in fiscal year 1993 to approximately $433,000 in fiscal
year 1994 to approximately $478,000 in fiscal year 1995, largely as a result of
the increase in the selling price per gallon.  While the Company expects to sell
more gallons as it implements its strategy of adding high-volume gasoline
pumpers, the price of gasoline can be volatile, and there can be no assurance
that sales of an increased number of gallons will result in higher revenues.  


Average merchandise sales per store, for stores open two full years, have
increased from approximately $426,000 in year 1993 to approximately $441,000 in
fiscal year 1994 and approximately $448,000 in fiscal year 1995.  This
merchandise sales growth trend is primarily the result of increased sales of
branded fast-food items and the enhancement of in-store traffic building
services, such as lottery tickets, money orders, utility bill collections and
free check cashing.  The Company intends to continue to add fast-food units to
its stores as well as other services designed to enhance in-store traffic,
including ATMs.  Tobacco sales represented 25.7% and 26.5% of total merchandise
sales in fiscal years 1994 and 1995, respectively.  Over the last two fiscal
years, the Company has experienced decreases in cigarettes sold.  In addition,
there has been volatility in selling prices as a result of competition among
cigarette manufacturers.  Since the Company expects this volatility to
continue, it has sought increased sales of other merchandise to offset the
uncertainty in cigarette sales.


The Company has grown primarily through acquisitions of groups of convenience
stores.  In fiscal year 1989, the Company acquired 65 stores from Handy Markets,
Inc. and 23 stores from Foodcraft, Inc.  In fiscal year 1992, the Company
consummated an acquisition of 141 convenience stores from Getty.  Following
acquisitions, the Company consolidates by closing redundant or underperforming
stores.  As part of the Getty acquisition, the Company added 16 franchised
stores, bringing to 50 the total number of franchised stores operated by the
Company.  Periodically, the Company has converted franchised stores to Company-
operated locations.  In general, the Company does not intend to expand the
number of franchised stores it operates, except in connection with acquisitions
or other special circumstances.
 

In connection with the Company's strategy to focus on expanding its convenience
stores, the Company made a strategic decision to dispose of its dairy
operation.  In April 1994, it consummated the sale of the dairy operation for
approximately $6.4 million.  The cash proceeds of the sale were primarily used
for capital expenditures, including remodeling, modernizing stores and adding
branded fast-food units.

Convenience stores selling gasoline have been heavily affected by environmental
regulations principally concerning underground storage tanks, which require 
large capital expenditures in order to achieve compliance.  In the late 1980s,
the Company made significant expenditures to meet, and exceed, applicable
standards.  Management believes that the Company is currently in compliance with
all applicable federal and state environmental laws and regulations and expects
to make minimal expenditures in the future to maintain compliance.  In addition,
the Company has adopted a program to ensure that new gasoline installations
comply with federal and state regulations.

RESULTS OF OPERATIONS


The following table sets forth the percentage relationship of certain expense
items to total revenues.  Since the Company's franchise agreements for 28 of the
Company's 39 franchise locations permit the Company to exercise complete control
over the operations of these 28 franchised stores and the Company bears the
attendant risks of ownership, the results of operations include sales and
related cost of sales of stores operated by these franchisees.  It should be
noted that the primary factors influencing the percentage relationship of cost
of sales to revenues are the volatility of gasoline prices and the proportional
increase in the number of stores selling gasoline.  On a percentage basis, the
gross profit on gasoline sales is significantly less than the gross profit on
merchandise sold in the convenience stores.

FISCAL YEAR 1995 COMPARED TO FISCAL YEAR 1994

The Company opened one new store during fiscal year 1995 and rebuilt two
locations.  The Company also closed six locations in fiscal year 1995, including
three franchised locations.  Total revenues were $327.0 million in fiscal year
1995 compared to $326.6 million in fiscal year 1994.  Fiscal year 1994 revenues
included $10.5 million of dairy sales which were not included in fiscal year
1995 since the Company's dairy operation was sold on April 1, 1994.  Exclusive
of dairy sales, total revenues increased 3.4% from fiscal year 1994 to fiscal
year 1995.


Because the Company had fewer stores in operation, merchandise sales decreased
by $987,000, or 0.5%, from $181.3 million in fiscal year 1994 to $180.3 million
in fiscal year 1995.  Merchandise sales at comparable stores increased 0.9%.


Gasoline sales increased $11.5 million, or 8.7%, from $132.2 million in fiscal
year 1994 to $143.7 million in fiscal year 1995.  The gasoline sales increase is
due primarily to higher retail selling prices per gallon sold.


Gross profits on merchandise sales in fiscal year 1995 were $725,000 higher
compared to fiscal year 1994 due to higher gross profit rates.  As a percentage
of merchandise revenues, gross profits increased from 35.4% in fiscal year 1994
to 36.0% in fiscal year 1995, primarily as a result of a differing mix of
merchandise sold, which included higher-margin items such as branded fast food.


Gross profits on gasoline sales increased by $2.0 million, or 11.6%, in fiscal
year 1995 compared to fiscal year 1994 as a result of an increase in gross
profits per gallon sold at the Company's convenience stores, from $0.117 in
fiscal year 1994 to $0.132 in fiscal year 1995, which resulted from favorable 
trends in wholesale gasoline price fluctuations.  As a percentage of gasoline
revenues, gross profits increased from 12.9% in fiscal year 1994 to 13.2% in
fiscal year 1995.


Other income, consisting primarily of rental income, promotional allowances and
franchise royalties, increased from $2.6 million in fiscal year 1994 to $3.0
million in fiscal year 1995.  The increase was primarily due to a higher level
of promotional allowances, which offset decreases in other components of other
income.


Total operational expenses attributable to the Company's dairy operation
decreased from $2.6 million in fiscal year 1994 to no expense in fiscal year
1995.  Excluding such expenses, selling expenses in fiscal 1995 of $64.4 million
were $702,000, or 1.1%, higher than fiscal year 1994 selling expenses of $63.7
million.  This increase is the result of increased convenience store expenses. 
General and administrative expense increased $453,000, or 7.0%, primarily due to
increased employee compensation and incentive programs.  Depreciation and
amortization decreased by $127,000, or 2.2%, reflecting the expense reduction
due to the April 1994 dairy sale offset by additional depreciation of
convenience store capital improvements.  Interest expense remained relatively
level as lower borrowing levels were offset by higher interest rates.


                                        19

<PAGE>
As a result of the factors mentioned above, earnings before income taxes in
fiscal year 1995 increased by $1.1 million, or 20.2%, from $5.5 million in
fiscal year 1994 to $6.7 million in fiscal year 1995.  Income taxes increased by
$629,000 due to higher pre-tax income and a reduced level of tax credits.  Net
earnings grew by $489,000 from $3.7 million, or $0.54 per share, in fiscal year
1994 to $4.2 million, or $0.66 per share, in fiscal year 1995.


FISCAL YEAR 1994 COMPARED TO FISCAL YEAR 1993

The Company opened three new stores during fiscal year 1994 and closed 30
underperforming stores, including two franchised locations.  In addition, two
franchised locations were converted to Company-operated stores, and one Company-
operated store was converted to a franchised location.  In addition, the Company
sold its dairy operation if fiscal year 1994.  Total non-dairy revenues in
fiscal year 1994 were $316.1 million compared to $319.0 in fiscal year 1993,
representing a decrease of $2.9 million, or 0.9%.


Due to the Company's closing of underperforming stores in the consolidation 
following the Getty acquisition, merchandise sales declined by $4.2 million, or
2.3%, from $185.5 million in fiscal year 1993 to $181.3 million in fiscal year
1994.  Merchandise sales at comparable stores remained essentially the same.


Total gasoline sales increased from $130.9 million in fiscal year 1993 to $132.2
million in fiscal year 1994, representing an increase of $1.3 million, or 1.0%,
due to the sale of an additional 2.7 million gallons of gasoline at the
Company's convenience stores.


Gross profits on merchandise sales declined by $1.3 million in fiscal year 1994
compared to 1993 due to lower sales volume resulting from the closing of
underperforming stores in connection with consolidation of the Getty
acquisition.  As a percentage of revenues, gross profits on merchandise sales
remained constant from fiscal year 1993 to fiscal year 1994.


Gasoline gross profits increased by $2.0 million, or 13.2%, in fiscal year 1994
due to the sale of additional gallons and an increase in gross profit per gallon
sold at the Company's convenience stores, from $0.106 in fiscal year 1993 
to $0.117 in fiscal year 1994, which resulted from favorable trends in wholesale
gasoline price fluctuations.  As a percentage of gasoline revenues, gross
profits on gasoline sales increased from 11.5% in fiscal year 1993 to 12.9% in
fiscal year 1994.


Total operational expenses attributable to the Company's dairy operation
decreased from $5.0 million in fiscal year 1993 to $2.6 million in fiscal year
1994 due to the sale of such operation.  Excluding such expenses, selling
expenses increased $461,000, or 0.7%, from $63.2 million in fiscal year 1993
compared to $63.7 million in fiscal year 1994, reflecting increased selling
expenses in the convenience store operation.  General and administrative
expenses declined by $427,000, or 6.2%, also due primarily to the sale of the
dairy operation.  Depreciation and amortization decreased by $1,006,000, or
15.1%, due to various factors including the sale of the dairy operation. 
Interest expense declined by $765,000, or 18.8%, as a result of lower borrowing
levels.
                                        20

<PAGE>
Earnings before income taxes in fiscal year 1994 of $5.5 million were higher
than in fiscal year 1993 by $1.0 million, or 22.1%.  Income taxes were $460,000
higher in fiscal year 1994 due to higher pre-tax income and an increased
effective tax rate from increased state income taxes and reduced tax credits. 
Net earnings increased from $3.1 million, or $0.46 per share, in fiscal year
1993 to $3.7 million, or $0.54 per share, in fiscal year 1994.


SEASONALITY AND QUARTERLY RESULTS


The Company's business has been subject to moderate seasonal influences with
higher sales in the third and fourth fiscal quarters of each year, since
customers tend to purchase more convenience items, such as ice, beverages and
fast food, and more gasoline during the warmer months.  Due to adverse weather
conditions, merchandise sales for the second fiscal quarter have generally been
lower than other quarters.  However, because of price volatility, gasoline
profit margins fluctuate significantly throughout the year.


The following table represents certain earnings data for the Company for the
last eight fiscal quarters:

LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES


Net cash provided by operating activities was $10.8 million for the year ended
September 30, 1995, as compared to $9.1 million for fiscal year 1994.  The
increase was principally due to higher net income in 1995.


Net cash used in investing activities was $8.3 million for fiscal year 1995 as
compared to $1.0 million for fiscal year 1994.  The Company used the proceeds of
the sale of the dairy operation for remodeling, modernizing stores and adding
branded fast-food units.  Purchases of property, equipment and improvements,
consisting primarily of remodeling existing stores and purchasing new land, were
$8.6 million in fiscal year 1995 and $5.1 million in fiscal year 1994.  Cash
flows from investing activities in fiscal year 1994 included the sale of the
dairy operation.


Net cash used by financing activities was $3.7 million in fiscal year 1995 as
compared to $9.4 million in fiscal year 1994, principally representing principal
payments on debt and the purchase of treasury stock in fiscal year 1994.


Most of the Company's sales are for cash and its inventory turns over rapidly. 
As a result, the Company's daily operations do not require large amounts of
working capital.  The Company has budgeted approximately $17 million in fiscal
year 1996 for capital expenditures, including construction of new stores, and
environmental compliance and anticipates debt and capital lease payments of
approximately $3.4 million in fiscal year 1996.  The Company believes that the
cost of constructing a prototypical store is approximately $500,000, although
additional costs to acquire land may vary considerably.


On December 26, 1995, the Company signed an agreement with its bank group to
borrow $10 million on an interest-only basis for a period of three years. 
Proceeds from the loan will be used to complete major remodels, including adding
branded fast-food units to existing stores, upgrading gasoline dispensing
facilities to high-volume pumping units, and new store construction.  In
addition, the Company has available $14.8 million under existing credit
agreements at September 30, 1995, including the $10.0 million loan.  The Company
anticipates that cash presently available and cash generated from operations
will be sufficient to fulfill its cash requirements in fiscal year 1996 and for
the foreseeable future.


IMPACT OF INFLATION


The Company believes that inflation has not had a material effect on its results
of operations in recent years.  Generally, increases in the Company's cost of 
merchandise can be quickly reflected in higher prices of goods sold.  However,
upward movement of gasoline costs may have short-term negative effects on profit
margins, since the Company's ability to raise gasoline prices can be limited by 
competition from other self-service gasoline outlets.  In addition, fluctuation

                             INDEPENDENT AUDITORS' REPORT
                             ----------------------------


The Board of Directors and Stockholders
Uni-Marts, Inc.
State College, Pennsylvania


We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Uni-Marts, Inc.
and subsidiaries, (the "Company"), as of September 30, 1995 and 1994, and the
related consolidated statements of earnings, stockholders' equity and cash flows
for each of the three years in the period ended September 30, 1995.  These
financial statements are the responsibility of the Company's management.  Our
responsibility is to express an opinion on the financial statements based on our
audits.

We conducted our audits in accordance with generally accepted auditing
standards.  Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material
misstatement.  An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting
the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements.  An audit also includes
assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by
management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. 
We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.

In our opinion, such consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all
material respects, the financial position of Uni-Marts, Inc. and subsidiaries as
of September 30, 1995 and 1994, and the results of their operations and their
cash flows for each of three years in the period ended September 30, 1995, in
conformity with generally accepted accounting principles.

                        NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
                       YEARS ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 1995, 1994 AND 1993

A.    SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES:
      ------------------------------------------

      The Company is an independent operator of convenience stores located in
      Pennsylvania, Virginia, New York, New Jersey, Delaware and Maryland.

      (1)    Principles of Consolidation -- The consolidated financial
             statements include the accounts of the Company and its wholly owned
             subsidiaries.  All material intercompany balances and transactions
             have been eliminated.

      (2)    Marketable Equity Securities -- The Company adopted Statement of
             Financial Accounting Standards No. 115, "Accounting for Certain
             Investments in Debt and Equity Securities," ("SFAS 115") effective
             October 1, 1994.  SFAS 115 requires the Company to account for debt
             and equity securities based on the classification into one of three
             categories:  held-to-maturity, available-for-sale, or trading. 
             Securities that are bought and held principally for the purpose of
             selling them in the near term are classified as trading securities.

             All securities held by the Company are classified as trading.
             These securities are carried at their market value which was
             specifically identified using published quotes as of the last day
             of business on September 30, 1995.  Unrealized holding losses for
             trading securities of $30,800, net of taxes of $18,500, are 
             included in earnings.

      (3)    Inventories -- The Company values its merchandise inventories at
             the lower of cost (first-in, first-out method) or market, as
             determined by the retail inventory method.  Gasoline inventories
             are valued at the lower of cost (first-in, first-out method) or
             market.

      (4)    Property, Equipment and Improvements -- Depreciation and
             amortization are calculated using the straight-line method over the
             useful lives of the related assets.  Amortization of improvements
             to leased properties is based on the remaining terms of the leases
             or the estimated useful lives of such improvements, whichever is
             shorter.

A.    SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (CONTINUED):
      ------------------------------------------------------

      (5)    Intangible and Other Assets -- Intangible and other assets consist
             of the following:

                                                      September 30,
                                                   1995                1994
                                               -----------         -----------
          Goodwill                             $ 6,498,671         $ 6,498,671
          Lease acquisition costs                1,639,505           1,674,483
          Non-competition agreements             1,213,040           1,213,040
          Other                                  1,694,767           1,647,520
                                               -----------         -----------
                                                11,045,983          11,033,714
          Less accumulated amortization          3,821,144           3,282,916
                                               -----------         -----------
                                               $ 7,224,839         $ 7,750,798
                                               ===========         ===========

             Goodwill represents the excess of costs over the fair value of net
             assets acquired in business combinations and is amortized on a
             straight-line basis over periods of 5 to 40 years.  Lease
             acquisition costs are the bargain element of acquired leases and
             are being amortized on a straight-line basis over the related lease
             terms.  Non-competition agreements are amortized over the terms of
             the particular agreements.  It is the Company's policy to
             periodically review and evaluate the recoverability of the
             intangible assets by assessing current and future profitability and
             cash flows and to determine whether the amortization of the
             balances over their remaining lives can be recovered through
             expected future results and cash flows.   

      (6)    Self-Insurance Reserves -- The Company assumes the risks for
             general liability and workers' compensation insurance exposures
             up to certain loss thresholds set forth in separate insurance
             contracts.  In fiscal 1994, the Company had assumed risks for
             health insurance exposures; however, on May 1, 1995, the Company
             entered into a commercial contract transferring the risks of its
             health insurance exposure to a third party.  The Company has
             established self-insurance reserves for these risks using actuarial
             valuations provided by independent companies which are recorded on
             a present value basis.  At September 30, 1995 and 1994, the Company
             had self-insurance reserves totaling $2,705,600 and $2,068,200,
             respectively.

      (7)    Income Taxes -- The Company accounts for income taxes under the
             provisions of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 109,
             "Accounting for Income Taxes," ("SFAS 109").  SFAS 109 requires the
             Company to compute deferred taxes on the difference between the
             financial statement and tax basis of assets and liabilities using
             enacted rates.

A.    SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (CONTINUED):
      ------------------------------------------------------

      (8)    Operations -- The Company operates 414 convenience stores, 39 of
             which are operated by franchisees (46 in 1994 and 49 in 1993). 
             During fiscal 1995, the results of operations include sales and
             costs of sales of 28 of these franchisees for which the Company
             exercises complete control and bears the attendant risks of
             ownership (33 in 1994 and 35 in 1993).  Net sales of stores
             operated by these franchisees were $13,057,200 (1995), $14,163,600
             (1994) and $15,286,800 (1993).

      (9)    Earnings Per Share -- Earnings per share are calculated based on
             the weighted average number of shares of common stock outstanding. 
             Common stock equivalents were not considered in the computation of
             earnings per share as the effect was not significant to the
             Company.

      (10)   Reclassifications -- Certain reclassifications have been made to
             the 1994 and 1993 financial statements to conform to the
             classifications used in 1995.

      The financial statements include noncurrent deferred tax liabilities of
      $2,876,400 and $2,806,800 in 1995 and 1994, respectively, and current
      deferred tax assets of $1,259,200 and $833,300, which are included in
      prepaid expenses and other.  No valuation allowance is required because,
      based upon the weight of available evidence, it is more likely than not
      that all of the deferred tax assets will be realized.

      Stock from Henry D. Sahakian, Chairman of the Company's Board, at $5.25
      per share.  The closing price of the Company's Common Stock on the
      American Stock Exchange on that date was $5.375 per share.  On this date,
      amounts due to the Company from Mr. Sahakian of $1,308,000 were paid. 

      Certain directors and officers of the Company are also directors,
      officers and shareholders of Unico Corporation ("Unico"), formerly the
      Company's parent, and other affiliated companies.  The following is a
      summary of significant transactions with these entities:

      (1)    The Company leases seven stores and certain other locations from
             Unico and leases its corporate headquarters and five additional
             locations from affiliates of Unico.  Aggregate rentals in
             connection with these leases were $700,300 (1995), $887,000 (1994)
             and $1,062,200 (1993).

      (2)    The Company charges an affiliate of Unico for general and
             administrative services provided.  Such charges amounted to $10,400
             (1995), $9,900 (1994) and $8,500 (1993).

      The Company received commissions from Coinfone Telecommunications, Inc.
      ("CTI") for coin-operated telephones installed at convenience store
      locations.  The majority of the stock of CTI is beneficially owned or
      controlled by persons related to Henry D. Sahakian.  Commissions received
      from CTI were $310,300 (1995), $241,400 (1994), and $62,500 (1993).

G.    RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS (Continued):
      --------------------------------------

      The Company acquired property for $1,605,300 in 1995 by exercising a
      property option that was controlled by Whitehall Associates, a partnership
      in which the Company was a partner.  Bruce K. Heim, a director of
      the Company, is also a partner in a partnership which controls 75% of
      Whitehall Associates.  The Company also paid rents of $86,300 and $129,800
      to Whitehall Associates in 1995 and 1994, respectively.

H.    RETIREMENT SAVINGS AND INCENTIVE PLAN:
      -------------------------------------

      The Company has a contributory retirement savings plan covering all
      employees meeting minimum age and service requirements.  The Company will
      match one-half of employee contributions up to 3% of the employee's
      compensation.  Effective July 1, 1991, the Company's contributions are
      invested in the Company's Common Stock.  The Board of Directors may
      elect to make additional contributions to be allocated among all eligible
      employees in accordance with provisions of the plan.  The retirement
      savings plan expense, which is funded currently, was $111,100 (1995),
      $116,000 (1994) and $111,000 (1993).

I.   DEFERRED COMPENSATION PLAN AND PERFORMANCE UNIT PLAN:
     ----------------------------------------------------

     The Company has a non-qualified unfunded deferred compensation plan which
     permits key executives to annually elect (via individual contracts) to
     defer a portion of their compensation until their retirement, death or
     disability.  The Company makes a 50% matching contribution not exceeding
     $5,000.  The deferred compensation expense was $27,000, $24,700 and $23,900
     for the years ended September 30, 1995, 1994 and 1993, respectively.

     The Company has recorded the assets and liabilities for the deferred
     compensation plan in the consolidated balance sheets because such assets
     and liabilities belong to the Company rather than to any plan or trust. 
     Asset and matching liability of $568,000 and $406,400 at September 30, 1995
     and 1994, respectively, include employee deferrals, accrued earnings and
     matching contributions by the Company.

     The Company also has a Performance Unit Plan to provide long-term
     incentives to senior executives.  Under the Performance Unit Plan, the
     amount of compensation is determined over the succeeding three-year period
     based upon performance of the Company as well as individual goals for the
     senior executives.  Compensation expense recognized under this plan was
     $100,000 for the year ended September 30, 1995.


J.   EQUITY COMPENSATION PLAN:
     ------------------------

     The Company has reserved 775,491 shares of common stock which can be
     issued in accordance with the terms of the Company's Equity Compensation
     Plan, as amended (the "Plan").




                                        37

<PAGE>
J.   EQUITY COMPENSATION PLAN (CONTINUED):
     ------------------------------------

     A committee of the Board of Directors has authority to administer the
     Plan, and the committee may grant qualified incentive stock options to
     employees of the Company, including officers, whether or not they are
     directors.  The Plan also provides that all non-employee directors will
     receive annual non qualified stock option grants for 2,000 shares and
     grants of shares of common stock on the date of each annual meeting.  The
     grants of stock will be equal in value to and in lieu of two-thirds of the
     non-employee directors' annual retainers.  During fiscal 1995, 6,223
     shares of common stock were granted to non-employee directors under the
     Plan.

     The exercise price of all options granted under the Plan may not be less
     than the fair market value of the common stock on the date of grant and
     the maximum allowable term of each option is ten years.  For qualified
     stock options granted to any person who holds more than 10% of the voting
     power of the outstanding stock, the exercise price may not be less than
     110% of the fair market value and the maximum allowable term is five
     years.

     Information regarding outstanding options is presented below.  All options
     outstanding are exercisable except for options granted during the year
     ended September 30, 1995.

K.    NON-QUALIFIED STOCK OPTIONS:
      ---------------------------

      The Company made a one-time, special grant of non-qualified stock options
      to Henry D. Sahakian and Daniel D. Sahakian each to purchase 150,000
      shares of common stock of the Company at a price of $4.50 per share in
      exchange for their relinquishment of effective voting control of the
      Company as a result of the elimination of the super-majority voting
      provisions of the Class B Common Stock.  These non-qualified stock options
      are not related to the Company's Equity Compensation Plan.  These stock
      options expire on February 25, 1998.

L.    SALE OF DAIRY OPERATION:
      -----------------------

      In April 1994, the Company sold the net assets of its dairy operation for
      approximately $6,438,000 and received a cash payment of $5,788,000 and
      105,906 shares of its common stock valued at $650,000.  The sale resulted
      in a pre-tax loss of $245,000 which is included as a reduction of other
      income.  The total effect of the sale on net earnings was a loss of
      $51,000.


M.    SUBSEQUENT EVENT:
      ----------------

      On December 26, 1995, the Company signed an agreement with its bank group
      to borrow $10 million on an interest-only basis for a period of three
      years.  Full amortization of the facility is required in fiscal 1999. 
      Proceeds from the loan will be used to complete major remodels, including
      adding prepared fast-food installations to existing stores, upgrading
      gasoline dispensing facilities to high-volume units and new store
      construction.

      This agreement has changed the composition of the Company's capital
      requirements.  Aggregate maturities of long-term debt during the next five
      years, including payments due in connection with the senior notes and the
      term loans are as follows: (See Note D)


                        September 30, 
                            1996                      $ 3,273,000

                                 TERM LOANS-B
                                 -------------


     3.01(B) TERM LOAN-B BORROWINGS.  Subject to the terms and conditions
hereof, and relying upon the representations and warranties herein set forth,
each Bank severally agrees to make a term loan or loans (collectively, the
"Term Loans-B") to the Borrower on or after the Amendment No.5 Closing Date in
such principal amount as the Borrower shall request up to but not exceeding
such Bank's Term Loan-B Commitment.  The obligation of each Bank to make a
Term Loan-B to the Borrower shall be in the proportion that such Bank's Term
Loan-B Commitment bears to the Term Loan-B Commitments of all Banks, but each
Bank's Term Loan-B shall never exceed its Term Loan-B Commitment.  The
failure of any Bank to make a Term Loan-B to the Borrower shall not relieve
any other Bank of its obligations to make a Term Loan-B to the Borrower nor
shall it impose any additional liability on any other Bank hereunder.  The
Banks shall have no obligation to make Term Loans-B hereunder after the Term
Loan-B Request Date.  The Term Loan-B Commitments are not revolving credit
commitments and the Borrower shall not have the right to borrow, repay and
reborrow under this Section 3.01(B).

     3.02(B) TERM LOAN-B REQUESTS.  Except as otherwise provided herein, the
Borrower may from time to time prior to the Term Loan-B Request Date request
the Banks to make Term Loans-B by delivery to the Agent, not later than 10:00
a.m. Pittsburgh time, (i) two (2) Business Days prior to the proposed
Borrowing Date with respect to the making of a Term Loan-B to which the Euro-
Rate Option applies or the conversion to or the renewal of the Euro-Rate
Option for any Term Loan-B; and (ii) one (1) Business Day prior to either the
proposed Borrowing Date with respect to the making of a Term Loan-B to which
the Base Rate Option applies or the last day of the preceding Interest Period
with respect to the conversion to the Base Rate Option for any Term Loan-B, of
a duly completed Loan Request in the form of Exhibit D hereto.  Each Loan
Request shall be irrevocable and shall specify (i) the proposed Borrowing
Date; (ii) the aggregate amount of the proposed Term Loan-B comprising each
Borrowing Tranche, which shall be in integral multiples of $500,000 and no
less than $1,000,000 for each Borrowing Tranche to which the Euro-Rate Option 
applies and not less than $1,000,000 for Term Loans-B or the maximum amount
available for Term Loans-B to which the Term Loan Base Rate Option applies;
(iii) whether the Euro-Rate Option or Base Rate Option shall apply to the
proposed Term Loan-B comprising the Borrowing Tranche; and (iv) in the case of
a Borrowing Tranche to which the Euro-Rate Option applies, an appropriate
Interest Period for the proposed Term Loan-B comprising such Borrowing
Tranche.

     3.03(B) MAKING TERM LOANS-B.  The Agent shall, promptly after receipt of
a Loan Request pursuant to Section 3.02(B), notify the Banks of its receipt of
such Loan Request specifying: (i) the proposed Borrowing Date and the time and
method for disbursement of such Term Loan-B; (ii) the amount and type of such
Term Loan-B and the applicable Euro-Rate Interest Period (if any); and (iii)
the apportionment among the Banks of the Term Loan-B as determined by the 

<PAGE>  55
Agent in accordance with Section 3.01(B) hereof.  Each Bank shall remit the 
principal amount of each Term Loan-B to the Agent such that the Agent is able
to, and the Agent shall, to the extent the Banks have made funds available to
it for such purpose, fund such Term Loan-B to the Borrower in U.S. Dollars in
immediately available funds at the Principal Office prior to 2:00 p.m.
Pittsburgh time on the Borrowing Date, provided that if any Bank fails to 
                                       --------
remit such funds to the Agent in a timely manner, the Agent may elect in its
sole discretion to fund with its own funds the Term Loan-B of such Bank on the
Borrowing Date.

     3.04(B) TERM LOAN-B COMMITMENT FEE.  Accruing from the date hereof until
the Term Loan-B Request Date, the Borrower agrees to pay to the Agent for the
account of each Bank, as consideration for the Term Loan-B Commitments
hereunder, a nonrefundable commitment fee (the "Term Loan-B Commitment Fee")
equal to one quarter percent (1/4%) per annum (computed on the basis of a year
of 365 or 366 days and actual days elapsed) on the average daily difference
between the amount of the Term Loan-B Commitments and the principal amount of
Term Loans-B outstanding.  All Term Loan-B Commitment Fees shall be payable in
arrears on the last Business Day of each fiscal quarter of the Borrower after
the date hereof, on the Term Loan-B Request Date and upon any acceleration of
the Notes.

     3.05(B) TERM LOAN-B NOTE.  The obligation of the Borrower to repay the
unpaid principal amount of the Term Loans-B made to it by each Bank, together
with interest thereon, shall be evidenced by a promissory note of the Borrower
dated the Amendment No. 5 Closing Date in substantially the form attached to
Amendment No. 5 as Exhibit A payable to the order of each Bank in the face 
                   ---------
amount of the Term Loan-B Commitment of such Bank.  The principal amount as
provided therein of each Term Note-B shall be payable in full on the Term
Loan-B Maturity Date.

     3.06(B) USE OF PROCEEDS.  The proceeds of the Term Loans-B will be used
by the Borrower for capital expenditures.

INDEPENDENT AUDITORS' REPORT
          
           
To the Trustees and Participants of
 Uni-Marts, Inc. Retirement Savings & Incentive Plan
State College, Pennsylvania
           
We have audited the accompanying statements of net assets available for benefits
of Uni-Marts, Inc. Retirement Savings & Incentive Plan as of September 30, 1995
and 1994, and the related statements of changes in net assets available for
benefits for each of the three years in the period ended September 30, 1995. 
These financial statements are the responsibility of the Plan's management.  Our
responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements based on
our audits.
           
We conducted our audits in accordance with generally accepted auditing
standards.  Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of
material misstatement.  An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence
supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements.  An audit
also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates
made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement
presentation.  We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our
opinion.
           
In our opinion, such financial statements present fairly, in all material
respects, the net assets available for benefits of the Plan as of September 30,
1995 and 1994, and the changes in net assets available for benefits for each of
the three years in the period ended September 30, 1995 in conformity with
generally accepted accounting principles.
           
Our audits were conducted for the purpose of forming an opinion on the basic
financial statements taken as a whole.  The supplemental schedules listed in the
Table of Contents are presented for the purpose of additional analysis and
are not a required part of the basic financial statements, but are supplementary
information required by the Department of Labor's Rules and Regulations for
Reporting and Disclosure under the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of
1974.  The supplemental information by fund in the statements of net assets
available for benefits and statements of changes in net assets available for
benefits is presented for the purpose of additional analysis rather than to
present information regarding the net assets available for benefits and changes
in net assets available for benefits of the individual funds and is not a
required part of the basic financial statements. The supplemental schedules and
supplemental information by fund are the responsibility of the Plan's
management.  Such supplemental schedules and supplemental information by fund
have been subjected to the auditing procedures applied in our audits of the
basic financial statements and, in our opinion, except for the omission of
certain historical cost information in the supplemental schedules, are fairly
stated in all material respects when considered in relation to the basic
financial statements taken as a whole.

RETIREMENT SAVINGS & INCENTIVE PLAN
           
NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
YEARS ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 1995 AND 1994
- -------------------------------------------------------------------------------

1.  THE PLAN

    Uni-Marts, Inc. Retirement Savings & Incentive Plan (the "Plan"), a defined
    contribution plan, was established October 1, 1983 to include all full-time
    employees of the former parent of Uni-Marts, Inc. and certain of its
    subsidiaries and related companies.  Effective October 1, 1987, the Plan was
    amended and restated to include only the employees of Uni-Marts, Inc. and
    its affiliates (the "Company").  The assets of the Plan attributable to
    employees of the former parent and related companies were spun off from the
    Plan effective the date of the amendment.   Uni-Marts, Inc. is the Trustee
    of the Plan.
           
    Employees are eligible to participate after attainment of age 21, and
    completion of at least 1,000 hours of service in one eligibility computation
    period.  Employees whose wages and conditions of employment are subject to
    agreement with a collective bargaining agent are not eligible to participate
    unless provided by the collective bargaining agreement.  The Plan is subject
    to the provisions of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974
    (ERISA).
           
    All eligible employees may direct the Company to contribute from 1% to 3% of
    their compensation to the Plan on their behalf as a basic contribution.  An
    additional amount up to 12% of compensation may be deposited as a
    supplemental contribution.  Total individual employee contributions are
    indexed annually for inflation and may not exceed $9,240, $8,994, and $8,728
    per Plan year ended 1995, 1994 and 1993, respectively, as provided in the
    Plan.  The Company will make matching contributions equal to $.50 for each
    $1.00 of basic contribution and may make an optional contribution at the
    discretion of the Board of Directors.  No optional contributions were made
    in the Plan years 1995, 1994 and 1993.  Each participant has at all times a
    100% nonforfeitable interest in their account balance.
           
    Effective October  1, 1992, the Plan was amended and restated.  The effect
    of this amendment is to reflect the merger of the Valley Farms, Inc. (a
    subsidiary of Uni-Marts, Inc.) Cash or Deferred Profit Sharing Plan with and
    into the Plan and to incorporate the amendments necessary to comply with
    regulations issued by the Internal Revenue Service (IRS).
           
    Each employee directs that his/her contribution be invested and reinvested
    in one or more of the investment funds selected by the Trustee and/or in the
    Company's common stock.  The Trustee determines how all amounts credited to
    a member's optional contribution account, if any, will be invested.  All
    income, expenses, gains or losses attributable to assets held in each
    investment fund are reflected therein exclusively.

    Participants' accounts may be withdrawn upon separation from the Company,
    death, disability or retirement (regular - age 65; early - age 55). 
    Withdrawals, except for hardship withdrawals, are distributed in lump sums,
    including earnings.  A participant may request a loan or apply for a


                                       9

<PAGE>  75
    hardship withdrawal in accordance with the provisions of the Plan.  The
    Company has the right to terminate the Plan subject to the provisions of
    ERISA.
          
2.  ADMINISTRATION OF THE PLAN
           
    The Company is the administrator of the Plan.  All fees related to the
    Plan's administration and recordkeeping are paid by the Company and
    therefore are not reported as an expense of the Plan.
           
3.  INVESTMENTS
           
    Investments representing units of funds maintained by diversified, open-end
    management investment companies are stated at fair value as determined by
    published market prices.  Uni-Marts, Inc. common stock is valued at the
    closing market price.  Income and expenses relating to these investments are
    recorded on the accrual basis of accounting.

    During 1995, 1994 and 1993, the Plan purchased from Uni-Marts, Inc. 29,054,
    28,937 and 36,704 shares of its common stock at a cost of $164,560, $160,785
    and $144,193, respectively.  The price paid for these shares was the average
    of the bid and ask price per share on the date purchased for the 1993 Plan
    year and the portion of the 1994 Plan year that the stock was traded on the
    over-the-counter market.  For the 1995 Plan year and the portion of the 1994
    Plan year that the stock was traded on the American Stock Exchange, the
    price paid for the shares was as traded on the American Stock Exchange.
           
4.  TAX STATUS
           
    The trust established under the Plan to hold the Plan's assets is qualified
    pursuant to the appropriate section of the Internal Revenue Code (IRC), and,
    accordingly, the trust's net investment income is exempt from income taxes. 
    The Plan obtained its latest determination letter on September 9, 1993, in
    which the IRS stated that the Plan, as then designed, was in compliance with
    the applicable requirements of the IRC.  The Plan has been amended since
    receiving the determination letter.  However, the Plan administrator and
    the Plan's tax counsel believe that the Plan is currently designed and being
    operated in compliance with the applicable requirements of the IRC. 
    Therefore, they believe that the Plan was qualified and the related
    trust was tax exempt as of the financial statement date.
