ITEM 1.  BUSINESS
 
GENERAL
 
    U  S WEST, Inc. ("U S WEST" or the "Company") is incorporated under the laws
of the State of Delaware  and has its principal  executive offices at 7800  East
Orchard  Road, Englewood, Colorado  80111, telephone number  (303) 793-6500. U S
WEST is a diversified global communications company, and conducts its operations
through U S  WEST Communications  Group ("Communications  Group") and  U S  WEST
Media  Group  ("Media  Group").  (Financial information  concerning  U  S WEST's
operations is  set forth  in  the Consolidated  Financial Statements  and  Notes
thereto,  which begin on  page B-29.) U  S WEST and  its subsidiaries had 61,047
employees at December 31, 1995.
 
    COMMUNICATIONS GROUP.  The major component of the Communications Group is  U
S  WEST  Communications,  Inc.  ("U  S  WEST  Communications"),  which  provides
telecommunications services to  more than  25 million  residential and  business
customers  in the states of Arizona,  Colorado, Idaho, Iowa, Minnesota, Montana,
Nebraska, New Mexico, North Dakota,  Oregon, South Dakota, Utah, Washington  and
Wyoming   (collectively,   the  "Communications   Group   Region").  U   S  WEST
Communications serves  approximately  80  percent of  the  Communications  Group
Region's population and approximately 40 percent of its geographic area.
 
    MEDIA   GROUP.     The  Media   Group  is   comprised  of:   (i)  cable  and
telecommunications network businesses outside of the Communications Group Region
and internationally,  (ii) domestic  and international  wireless  communications
network   businesses  and   (iii)  domestic  and   international  directory  and
information services businesses, including telephone directories.
 
RECENT DEVELOPMENTS
 
    AGREEMENT TO ACQUIRE CONTINENTAL CABLEVISION, INC.  On February 27, 1996,  U
S  WEST announced  a definitive  agreement under  which Continental Cablevision,
Inc. ("Continental") will be merged with and into the Company. Continental,  the
nation's third-largest cable operator, serves 4.2 million U.S. customers, passes
more  than seven million U.S. households and owns significant other domestic and
international assets. The Company will  purchase all of Continental's stock  for
approximately  $5.3  billion,  and  will  assume  Continental's  debt  and other
obligations, which amount  to approximately $5.5  billion. Consideration of  the
$5.3  billion in  equity will consist  of approximately  $1 billion in  U S WEST
preferred stock, convertible  to Media Stock;  $2.8 billion to  $3.3 billion  in
shares  of Media Stock; and,  at U S WEST's option,  between $1 billion and $1.5
billion in  cash. The  transaction, which  is expected  to close  in the  fourth
quarter,  is subject to  a number of conditions,  including regulatory and other
approvals such as that of Continental's shareholders. There can be no  assurance
that these conditions will be satisfied.
 
    RECAPITALIZATION  PLAN.  On October 31, 1995,  the shareholders of U S WEST,
Inc., a Colorado corporation ("U S  WEST Colorado") voted to approve a  proposal
(the "Recapitalization Plan") adopted by the Board of Directors to reincorporate
from  Colorado  to Delaware  and create  two  classes of  common stock  that are
intended to  reflect  separately  the  performance  of  the  communications  and
multimedia businesses. Under the Recapitalization Plan, shareholders approved an
Agreement and Plan of Merger between U S WEST Colorado and U S WEST, pursuant to
which  U S WEST continues  as the surviving corporation.  In connection with the
merger, the  Certificate of  Incorporation of  U  S WEST  has been  amended  and
restated  to, among other things,  designate two classes of  common stock of U S
WEST, one class of which is authorized  as U S WEST Communications Group  Common
Stock  ("Communications Stock"), and the  other class is authorized  as U S WEST
Media Group Common Stock ("Media Stock"). Effective November 1, 1995, each share
of common stock of U S WEST Colorado converted into one share of  Communications
Stock and one share of Media Stock.
 
                                       1
<PAGE>
    The   Communications  Stock  and   Media  Stock  are   designed  to  provide
shareholders with separate  securities that are  intended to reflect  separately
the  communications  businesses of  U S  WEST  Communications and  certain other
subsidiaries of the Communications Group,  and the multimedia businesses of  the
Media Group.
 
    The  Communications Group is comprised of U  S WEST Communications, U S WEST
Communications Services,  Inc.,  U S  WEST  Federal  Services, Inc.,  U  S  WEST
Advanced  Technologies, Inc.  and U  S WEST  Business Resources,  Inc. U  S WEST
Communications comprised approximately 97 percent of the revenues and 98 percent
of the assets of the Communications Group in 1995.
 
    The Media Group is comprised of U S WEST Marketing Resources Group, Inc.,  a
publisher  of White and Yellow Pages telephone directories and other information
services including database marketing and  other interactive services, U S  WEST
NewVector  Group, Inc.,  which provides communications  and information products
and services over wireless networks,  U S WEST Multimedia Communications,  Inc.,
which  owns domestic cable  television operations and investments,  and U S WEST
International Holdings, Inc., which primarily owns investments in  international
cable  and telecommunications, wireless  communications and directory publishing
operations.
 
    Dividends paid to the holders  of Communications Stock are currently  $0.535
per share per quarter. Dividends on the Communications Stock will be paid at the
discretion  of the  Board of  Directors of  U S  WEST, based  primarily upon the
financial condition,  results of  operations and  business requirements  of  the
Communications Group and the Company as a whole. With regard to the Media Stock,
the  Board of Directors of U S WEST currently intends to retain future earnings,
if any,  for  the development  of  the Media  Group's  businesses and  does  not
anticipate paying dividends on the Media Stock in the foreseeable future.
 
    TELECOMMUNICATIONS  ACT  OF  1996.    On  February  1,  1996,  the  House of
Representatives and the Senate approved a final bill that is intended to promote
competition between local telephone companies, long-distance carriers and  cable
television  operators. This bill  was signed into  law on February  8, 1996, and
replaces the antitrust consent decree that  broke up the "Bell System" in  1984.
Major provisions of the legislation include the pre-emption of state regulations
that   prohibit  competition.   The  Act   allows  local   telephone  companies,
long-distance carriers  and cable  television companies  to enter  each  other's
lines of business. To participate in the interLATA long-distance business within
their regions, the Regional Bell Operating Companies must first open their local
networks  to  facilities-based  competition  by satisfying  a  detailed  list of
requirements, including interconnection and number portability. The  legislation
also  eliminates within three  years most regulation  of cable television rates.
The Act lifts the ban on cross-ownership between cable television and  telephone
companies,  permitting the Regional  Bell Operating Companies  to enter into the
cable business within their respective  service territories, but prohibits  them
from  doing so through the purchase of existing cable companies, except in rural
communities. The  legislation reaffirms  the concept  of universal  service  and
directs  the  Federal  Communications  Commission and  the  states  to determine
universal service  funding policy.  The  Federal Communications  Commission  and
state regulators have been given the responsibility to interpret and oversee the
implementation of this legislation.
 
COMMUNICATIONS GROUP
 
    OPERATIONS.   The principal types  of telecommunications services offered by
the Communications Group  are (i)  local service, (ii)  exchange access  service
(which connects customers to the facilities of interLATA service providers), and
(iii)  intraLATA long-distance network service. For  the year ended December 31,
1995, local service, exchange access service and intraLATA long distance network
service accounted for  46%, 33% and  13%, respectively, of  the sales and  other
revenues   of  the  Communications  Group.  At  December  31,  1995,  U  S  WEST
Communications had approximately  14,847,000 telephone network  access lines  in
service, a 3.6% increase over year end 1994. Excluding the effect of the sale of
approximately  95,000  rural telephone  access lines  during 1995,  access lines
increased 4.2% over  year end 1994.  In 1995, revenues  from a single  customer,
AT&T, accounted for approximately
 
                                       2
<PAGE>
11%  of the sales and other revenues of  the Communications Group, and 9% of the
sales and other  revenues of  U S WEST.  The Communications  Group expensed  $22
million, $31 million and $42 million for research and development costs in 1995,
1994 and 1993, respectively.
 
    U  S WEST Communications incurred capital expenditures of approximately $2.7
billion in 1995  and expects to  incur approximately $2.5  billion in 1996.  The
1995  capital expenditures of U S WEST Communications were substantially devoted
to the continued modernization of telephone plant, to improve customer  services
and to accommodate additional line capability in several states.
 
    DEVELOPMENT  OF BROADBAND NETWORK.   A market trial  for a broadband network
capable of providing voice,  data and video services  to customers commenced  in
the  Omaha area  in August,  1995. The Communications  Group does  not intend to
expand this service offering beyond the  Omaha area because of service cost  and
pricing  issues. The Communications  Group does plan to  continue to provide the
system that delivers basic, premium and pay-per-view video services in the Omaha
area. The Communications Group is  evaluating the relative costs of  alternative
video  technologies,  as  well  as  the  near-term  feasibility  of  interactive
services. To  satisfy  anticipated  demand  for  combined  video  and  telephony
services  on  a cost-effective  basis, the  Communications Group's  strategy may
include selective investments in wireless cable technologies.
 
    THE RESTRUCTURING  PLAN.    U  S  WEST announced  in  1993  that  U  S  WEST
Communications  would implement  a plan  (the "Restructuring  Plan") designed to
provide  faster,   more  responsive   customer  service   and  improved   repair
capabilities while reducing the cost of providing these services. As part of the
Restructuring  Plan,  the Communications  Group  is developing  new  systems and
enhanced system functionality that will enable it to monitor networks to  reduce
the  risk of service interuptions, activate telephone service on demand, rapidly
design and  engineer products  and services  for customers,  and centralize  its
service  centers.  The Communications  Group has  consolidated its  560 customer
service centers into 26  centers in ten  cities and plans  on reducing its  work
force  by approximately  10,000 employees  in connection  with the Restructuring
Plan. Work  force reductions  under  the Restructuring  Plan will  be  partially
offset  by the effects  of higher than  anticipated volumes of  business and the
achievement of customer service objectives. All service centers are  operational
and supported by new systems and system functionality. The Restructuring Plan is
expected  to be substantially  completed by the end  of 1997. Implementation has
been affected by growth in the business and related service issues, new business
opportunities, revisions to  system delivery schedules  and productivity  issues
caused  by  the major  rearrangement of  resources  due to  restructuring. These
issues will continue to  affect the timing of  employee separations. See  "Costs
and  Expenses"  and  "Restructuring Charge"  under  Management's  Discussion and
Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations on p. B-9 and p. B-10.
 
    REGULATION.   U S  WEST  Communications is  subject  to varying  degrees  of
regulation  by state commissions  with respect to  intrastate rates and service,
and access charge tariffs. U S WEST  is also subject to the jurisdiction of  the
FCC  with respect to interstate access tariffs (that specify the charges for the
origination and termination of interstate communications) and other matters.
 
    U S WEST's interstate services have been subject to price-cap regulation  by
the  FCC since January  1991. Price caps  are an alternative  form of regulation
designed to limit prices rather than profits. However, the FCC's price cap  plan
includes sharing of earnings in excess of authorized levels. In March, 1995, the
FCC  issued an interim  order on price  cap regulation. The  price cap index for
most services  is  annually  adjusted  for  inflation,  productivity  level  and
exogenous costs, and has resulted in reduced access prices paid by interexchange
carriers to local telephone companies. The interim order also provides for three
productivity   options,  including  a  no-sharing   option,  and  for  increased
flexibility for adjusting prices downward  in response to competition. In  1995,
the Communications Group selected the lowest productivity option while, prior to
this   interim  order,  the   Communications  Group  used   an  optional  higher
productivity factor  in  determining prices.  Consequently,  the  Communications
Group expects the order to have no significant near-term impact.
 
                                       3
<PAGE>
    U  S WEST Communications is currently  working with state regulators to gain
approval  of  initiatives,  including  efforts  to  rebalance  prices,   advance
competitive  parity and implement simplified forms  of price and service quality
regulation. State and  local regulatory  authorities may  also regulate  certain
terms  and conditions of the  offering of wireless services,  such as the siting
and construction  of transmitter  towers, antennas  and equipment  shelters  and
zoning   and  building   permit  approvals.  See   "Competitive  and  Regulatory
Environment" under Management's Discussion  and Analysis of Financial  Condition
and Results of Operations on p. B-22.
 
    COMPETITION.    The  Communications  Group faces  competition  in  the local
exchange  business,  exchange  access   and  intraLATA  long-distance   markets,
primarily from competitive access providers ("CAPS") and interexchange carriers.
CAPs compete with the Communications Group by providing large business customers
with  high-capacity  network  services  that  connect  to  interexchange carrier
facilities or  other business  locations within  a serving  LATA.  Interexchange
carriers   compete  with   the  Communications  Group   by  providing  intraLATA
long-distance services. Such  competition is  eroding U  S WEST  Communications'
market  share of intraLATA long-distance services, including Wide Area Telephone
Service and "800" services. Interexchange carriers are competing in this area by
offering lower prices and packaging these services on an intraLATA and interLATA
basis.
 
    Technological advancements and regulatory changes will increase  competition
in  the future. Current competitors,  including CAPs and interexchange carriers,
are positioning themselves  to offer  local exchange  services. New  competitors
that  are affiliates of cable television  companies and power companies also are
expected to play a greater role in offering local exchange services. In addition
to local exchange services, competitors are expected to offer services that will
compete with  those U  S WEST  Communications plans  to offer,  including  video
programming  and interactive  multimedia services. Services  offered by cellular
and PCS operators also  will compete with  existing and future  services of U  S
WEST  Communications, including  future wireless services.  AT&T's entrance into
the wireless communications business through  its acquisition of McCaw  Cellular
Communications,  Inc. may create increased competition in local exchange as well
as wireless services. The loss of local exchange customers to competitors  would
affect multiple revenue streams of U S WEST Communications.
 
    The  adoption of the Telecommunications  Act of 1996 will  have an impact on
the competition faced by the  Communications Group. See "Recent Developments  --
Telecommunications  Act of  1996," and "Competitive  and Regulatory Environment"
under Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of
Operations on p. B-22.
 
MEDIA GROUP
 
    OPERATIONS.     The   Media   Group   is  comprised   of   (i)   cable   and
telecommunications network businesses outside of the Communications Group Region
and  internationally,  (ii) domestic  and international  wireless communications
network  businesses  and   (iii)  domestic  and   international  directory   and
information  services businesses. For the year ended December 31, 1995, domestic
and international directory  and information services  businesses accounted  for
10%  of the sales  and other revenues of  U S WEST. The  Media Group expensed $3
million, $6 million and $5 million  for research and development costs in  1995,
1994 and 1993, respectively.
 
    CABLE  AND  TELECOMMUNICATIONS.    The  Media  Group's  domestic  cable  and
telecommunications  operations  are  conducted  through  U  S  WEST   Multimedia
Communications,  Inc.  ("U S  WEST Multimedia")  and  consist of  domestic cable
properties and investments outside of the Communications Group Region, including
U S  WEST  Multimedia's ownership  of  cable  systems in  the  Atlanta,  Georgia
metropolitan  area (the  "Atlanta Systems")  and its  investment in  Time Warner
Entertainment Company L.P.  ("TWE" or "Time-Warner  Entertainment"), the  second
largest provider of cable television services in the United States.
 
    On  February 27, 1996,  U S WEST  announced a definitive  agreement to merge
with Continental Cablevision, Inc. for a combination of cash, U S WEST preferred
stock (convertible to Media Stock)
 
                                       4
<PAGE>
and shares of Media Stock valued at $5.3 billion. The transaction also  involves
an  assumption of  debt and  other obligations  amounting to  approximately $5.5
billion.  See  "Recent   Developments  --  Agreement   to  Acquire   Continental
Cablevision, Inc."
 
    The  Media Group's international cable and telecommunications operations are
conducted  through  U   S  WEST   International  Holdings,  Inc.   ("U  S   WEST
International")  and include  investments in  cable and  telecommunications that
focus  on  serving  mass  market  business  and  residential  customers  in  key
geographic  markets. To  decrease investment risk  and gain  access to technical
skills and capabilities,  U S  WEST International's  strategy has  been to  make
these  investments with other  major cable television  companies, including Time
Warner Inc. and Tele-Communications, Inc. In certain circumstances, foreign laws
require the participation of local partners in these ventures.
 
    U S WEST International, through  subsidiaries, owns a 26.8 percent  interest
in  TeleWest plc ("TeleWest"), the largest provider of combined cable television
and residential and business telecommunications services in the United  Kingdom.
In  1995, TeleWest Communications plc merged  its cable television and telephony
interests with  SBC CableComms  (UK) to  form TeleWest.  An affiliate  of  Tele-
Communications, Inc., ("TCI International") also owns a 26.8 percent interest in
TeleWest, with the remaining interests held by the public.
 
    WIRELESS  COMMUNICATIONS.   U  S  WEST NewVector  Group,  Inc. ("NewVector")
provides  cellular  services   to  customers  over   wireless  networks  in   26
metropolitan  service areas and 28 rural  service areas located primarily in the
Communications Group  Region. NewVector's  cellular services  provide  customers
with  high-quality and  readily available  two-way communications  services that
interconnect with local and long-distance telephone networks. As of December 31,
1995, NewVector had  approximately 1,463,000  cellular customers,  a 51  percent
increase from December 31, 1994.
 
    In  1994,  the Company  entered into  a  definitive agreement  with AirTouch
Communications to  combine their  domestic cellular  assets. AirTouch's  initial
equity  ownership of the joint venture will  be approximately 70 percent and the
Media Group's will be approximately 30 percent. The combination will take  place
in  two phases.  During Phase I,  which U  S WEST entered  effective November 1,
1995, the two companies  are operating their  cellular properties separately.  A
Wireless Management Company ("WMC") has been formed and is providing centralized
services  to both companies on  a contract basis. In Phase  II, AirTouch and U S
WEST will  contribute their  domestic cellular  assets to  the WMC.  The  recent
passage of the Telecommunications Act of 1996 has removed significant regulatory
barriers  to completion of Phase II of the business combination, and the Company
expects that Phase II closing  could take place by the  end of 1996 or in  early
1997.
 
    U  S  WEST has  entered into  a venture  with AirTouch  Communications, Bell
Atlantic and NYNEX Corporation to form a strategic national wireless alliance. U
S WEST has entered  into a separate  venture with the  same partners to  provide
personal  communications  services  ("PCS").  This  PCS  venture,  known  as PCS
PrimeCo, acquired rights to  11 licenses in 1995  in the Federal  Communications
Commission's  auction of  PCS radio spectrum.  The 11 licenses  cover 57 million
people in Chicago,  Dallas, Honolulu, Houston,  Jacksonville, Miami,  Milwaukee,
New Orleans, Richmond, San Antonio and Tampa.
 
    U  S WEST International owns interests in wireless communications systems or
investments in  several  countries,  including  the  United  Kingdom,  Malaysia,
Russia, Hungary, the Czech Republic, the Slovak Republic and Japan.
 
    U S WEST International, through subsidiaries, owns 50 percent of Mercury One
2  One, a 50-50 joint venture between subsidiaries of U S WEST International and
Cable & Wireless  plc. Mercury One  2 One operates  a PCS system  in the  United
Kingdom.  Mercury One 2  One's PCS is a  digital cellular communications service
designed to offer consumers higher  quality service, increased privacy and  more
features  at lower prices than existing cellular communications systems. To meet
growing customer demand, Mercury One 2 One has expanded its coverage to reach 30
percent of the United Kingdom's population.
 
                                       5
<PAGE>
    DIRECTORY AND  INFORMATION SERVICES.   The  Media Group,  through  Marketing
Resources,  provides  directory publishing  as  well as  database  marketing and
interactive  services.   Marketing  Resources   publishes,  prints   and   sells
advertising  in  more  than  300  White  and  Yellow  Pages  directories  in the
Communications Group Region. Marketing Resources' growth strategy is to increase
its advertiser base through  expanded marketing efforts,  the expansion of  core
products,  such  as  new  targeted  directories  for  specific  neighborhoods or
industries and development of  new directory features,  and the development  and
packaging  of  new  information  products,  such  as  local  audiotext services.
Marketing Resources'  yellow pages  directory advertising  business had  revenue
growth of approximately 6.4 percent in 1995.
 
    Marketing  Resources also  provides database marketing  services that enable
businesses to segment and target customers  and is developing the capability  to
provide  one-to-one marketing over interactive networks. In the future Marketing
Resources  plans  to  develop,   package,  market  and  distribute   integrated,
interactive  communications, entertainment, information and transaction services
over networks operated by the Media Group and others, including the networks  of
the Communications Group in the Communications Group Region.
 
    U  S WEST  International owns 100  percent of Thomson  Directories, which it
acquired in 1994. Thomson Directories annually publishes 156 directories in  the
United  Kingdom, reaching 46 million people, or 80 percent of all households, in
the United Kingdom. U S WEST International owns a 50 percent interest in Listel,
Brazil's largest telephone directory publisher, which  it acquired in 1994. U  S
WEST  International  also  owns  100  percent  of  Polska,  which  publishes  32
directories in Poland with a combined circulation of approximately 1.7 million.
 
    In June  1995, a  subsidiary of  U S  WEST International  purchased a  9.01%
interest  in  Flextech plc  ("Flextech"), one  of  the United  Kingdom's largest
providers of cable television and satellite programming. U S WEST  International
has the right to appoint one representative to Flextech's board of directors.
 
    REGULATION.   The products  and services of  the Media Group  are subject to
varying degrees of  regulation. Under  the Telecommunications Act  of 1996,  the
regulation  of cable television  rates will be  discontinued effective March 31,
1999, or earlier if competition exists. The same Act also (i) eliminates certain
cross-ownership   restrictions   among   cable   operators,   broadcasters   and
multichannel, multipoint distribution system operators, (ii) removes barriers to
competition  with local  exchange providers,  and (iii)  eliminates restrictions
that previously applied to the Media Group relating to long-distance services.
 
    Cable television systems  are also  subject to  local regulation,  typically
imposed  through the franchising process. Local officials may be involved in the
initial franchise  selection,  system  design  and  construction,  safety,  rate
regulation,  customer  service standards,  billing  practices, community-related
programming and services, franchise renewal and imposition of franchise fees.
 
    The Media Group is subject to  various regulations in the foreign  countries
in  which it has operations. In the United Kingdom, the licensing, construction,
operation,  sale   and  acquisition   of  cable   and  wireline   and   wireless
communications systems are regulated by various governmental entities, including
the Department of Trade and Industry and the Department of National Heritage.
 
    COMPETITION.    U S  WEST  Multimedia's cable  television  systems generally
compete for  viewer  attention  with  programming from  a  variety  of  sources,
including  the direct reception of broadcast  television signals by the viewer's
own antenna,  subscription  and  low  power  television  stations,  multichannel
multipoint  distribution systems ("MMDS" or  "wireless cable"), satellite master
antenna  ("SMATV")  service,  direct   broadcast  satellite  ("DBS")   services,
telephone companies, including other RBOC's, and other cable companies within an
operating  area.  The  extent  of  such competition  in  any  franchise  area is
dependent, in  part, upon  the quality,  variety and  price of  the  programming
provided  by  these technologies.  Many  of these  competitive  technologies are
generally not subject to the same local government regulation that affects cable
television. Cable television
 
                                       6
<PAGE>
systems are also  in competition  for both  viewers and  advertising in  varying
degrees  with other communications and entertainment media, and such competition
may increase with  the development  and growth of  new technologies.  TeleWest's
cable  television  services  compete  with  broadcast  television  stations, DBS
services, SMATV systems and certain narrowband operators in the United Kingdom.
 
    U  S  WEST  Multimedia  will  be  offering  telecommunications  services  in
competition  with the dominant local exchange  carriers ("LECs"), CAPs and other
potential providers of telephone services  in local domestic markets,  including
the interexchange carriers such as AT&T, MCI Communications and Sprint Corp. The
degree  of competition will be dependent  upon the state and federal regulations
concerning entry, interconnection requirements, and the degree of unbundling  of
the  LECs' networks. Competition  will be based upon  price, service quality and
breadth of services offered. TeleWest's telecommunications services compete with
domestic  telephone  companies   in  the   United  Kingdom,   such  as   British
Telecommunications plc.
 
    New  Vector's wireless business  is subject to  FCC regulation and licensing
requirements. To  assure  competition,  the  FCC  has  awarded  two  competitive
cellular  licenses  in  each  market.  Many  competing  cellular  providers  are
substantial businesses  with  experience  in  broadcasting,  telecommunications,
cable  television and radio common carrier  services. In many markets, competing
cellular service is provided by businesses owned or controlled by a LEC, AT&T or
other major telephone companies. Competition is based upon the price of cellular
service, the quality of the service and the size of the geographic area  served.
The  development  of  PCS  services will  create  multiple  new  competitors for
NewVector's wireless  businesses.  Competition  for the  provision  of  wireless
services  is also  provided by  providers of  enhanced specialized  mobile radio
services. In the United Kingdom, Mercury One 2 One's operations compete with two
established cellular providers and one PCS provider. In addition, Mercury One  2
One  competes in  the consumer market  with telephone companies  such as British
Telecommunications plc.
 
    Marketing  Resources'  directory  publishing  businesses  continue  to  face
significant  competition from local  and national publishers  of directories, as
well as other advertising media such as newspapers, magazines, broadcast  media,
direct  mail and operator assisted services.  Directory listings are now offered
in electronic data bases through telephone company and third party networks.  As
such offerings expand and are enhanced through interactivity and other features,
the  Company will experience heightened  competition in its directory publishing
businesses. Marketing Resources will  continue to expand  its core products  and
develop  and  package new  information products  to  meet its  customers' needs.
Marketing  Resources'  database  marketing   services  also  continue  to   face
competition  from direct  mail list  providers, co-op  direct mail  programs and
coupon programs. Marketing Resources will also face emerging competition in  the
provision  of  interactive  services  from  cable  and  entertainment companies,
on-line services, advertising agencies  specializing in interactive  advertising
and  many small companies who are information providers. Many of these potential
competitors may also be joint venture partners, suppliers or distributors.
 
    The actions of public  policy makers play an  important role in  determining
how  increased competition affects  the Media Group. The  Media Group is working
with regulators and legislators to help ensure that public policies are fair and
in the best interests of customers.

and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operation on p. B-22.
 
ITEM 2.  PROPERTIES.
 
    The  properties  of  U S  WEST  do  not lend  themselves  to  description by
character and location of principal units. At December 31, 1995, the majority of
U S WEST property was utilized  in providing telecommunications services by U  S
WEST  Communications.  Substantially all  of  U S  WEST  Communications' central
office equipment is located  in owned buildings situated  on land owned in  fee,
while  many  garages  and  administrative and  business  offices  are  in leased
quarters.

ITEM 3.  LEGAL PROCEEDINGS.
 
    U S WEST and its subsidiaries are subject to claims and proceedings  arising
in  the ordinary course of business. While complete assurance cannot be given as
to the outcome of any  contingent liabilities, in the opinion  of U S WEST,  any
financial  impact to  which U  S WEST  and its  subsidiaries are  subject is not
expected to  be material  in  amount to  U S  WEST's  operating results  or  its
financial position.
 
    On  September 22, 1995, U S WEST  filed a lawsuit in Delaware Chancery Court
to enjoin the proposed merger of Time  Warner and Turner Broadcasting. U S  WEST
has  alleged  breaches  of  contract  and fiduciary  duties  by  Time  Warner in
connection with this proposed merger. Time Warner filed a countersuit against  U
S  WEST on October 11, 1995,  alleging misrepresentation, breach of contract and
other misconduct on  the part of  U S  WEST. Time Warner's  countersuit seeks  a
reformation  of the  Time Warner  Entertainment partnership  agreement, an order
that enjoins U S WEST from  breaching the partnership agreement and  unspecified
compensatory  damages. U S WEST  has denied each of  the claims in Time Warner's
countersuit. Trial for this action concluded on March 22, 1996. A ruling by  the
Delaware Chancery Court is expected in June 1996.

ITEM 9.  CHANGES IN AND DISAGREEMENTS WITH ACCOUNTANTS ON ACCOUNTING AND
FINANCIAL DISCLOSURE.
 
    Coopers  & Lybrand L.L.P.  has served as  the Company's independent auditor,
and Arthur  Andersen LLP  has served  as  the primary  auditing firm  for  major
subsidiaries  within U S WEST Media Group,  since 1984. In view of the Company's
new targeted stock structure, the Company determined, following a recommendation
of the Audit Committee,  that it will  be more efficient  and effective for  the
Company  to have  a single  firm perform  the auditing  function for  the entire
business.
 
    During the Company's two  most recent fiscal years  ended December 31,  1995
and  December 31, 1994, the reports of Coopers & Lybrand L.L.P. on the Company's
financial statements contained no adverse opinion or disclaimer of opinion,  nor
were  they qualified  or modified as  to uncertainty, audit  scope or accounting
principles. In  addition,  during such  fiscal  years and  the  interim  periods
thereafter:  (1) no disagreements with Coopers & Lybrand L.L.P. have occurred on
any  matter  of   accounting  principles  or   practices,  financial   statement
disclosure, or auditing scope or procedure, which disagreements, if not resolved
to  the satisfaction of Coopers  & Lybrand L.L.P., would  have caused it to make
reference to  the subject  matter of  the disagreement  in connection  with  its
report on the Company's financial statements; (2) no reportable events involving
Coopers  & Lybrand L.L.P. have occurred  that must be disclosed under applicable
securities laws; and (3) the Company has not consulted with Arthur Andersen  LLP
on  items that concerned the application  of accounting principles to a specific
transaction, either completed or proposed, or on the type of audit opinion  that
might be rendered on the Company's financial statements.

  1995 income from continuing operations includes a gain of $95 ($0.20 per Media
  share)  from the merger of  U S WEST's joint  venture interest in TeleWest plc
  with SBC CableComms (UK),  a gain of $85  ($0.18 per Communications share)  on
  the   sales  of  certain   rural  telephone  exchanges   and  $17  ($0.01  per

  sale of the Company's paging operations and a gain of $51 ($0.11 per share) on
  the  sales of certain  rural telephone exchanges.  1993 income from continuing
  operations was reduced by a restructuring charge of $610 ($1.46 per share) and
  a charge of $54 ($0.13 per share) for the cumulative effect on deferred  taxes
  of  the 1993 federally mandated increase in income tax rates. 1991 income from
  continuing operations was reduced by a restructuring charge of $230 ($0.57 per
  share).
 
(2)

  Communications  share and $0.01 per Media  share) for the early extinguishment
  of debt. 1993 net income was reduced by extraordinary charges of $3,123 ($7.45
  per share)  for  the  discontinuance  of  Statement  of  Financial  Accounting
  Standards   ("SFAS")  No.  71  and  $77   ($0.18  per  share)  for  the  early
  extinguishment of debt. 1993 net income also includes a charge of $120  ($0.28

                 (DOLLARS IN MILLIONS, EXCEPT PER SHARE AMOUNTS)
 
THE RECAPITALIZATION PLAN
 
    On  October  31,  1995, the  shareholders  of  U S  WEST,  Inc.,  a Colorado
corporation  ("U  S  WEST   Colorado"),  voted  to   approve  a  proposal   (the
"Recapitalization  Plan") adopted by the Board  of Directors to reincorporate in
Delaware and  create two  classes of  common stock.  Under the  Recapitalization
Plan,  shareholders approved an  Agreement and Plan  of Merger between  U S WEST
Colorado and  U  S  WEST, Inc.,  a  Delaware  corporation ("U  S  WEST"  or  the
"Company"),  pursuant to which U S  WEST continues as the surviving corporation.
In connection with the merger, the Certificate of Incorporation of U S WEST  has
been  amended and restated to designate two classes of common stock of U S WEST,
one class of which is authorized as  U S WEST Communications Group Common  Stock
("Communications  Stock") and the  other class which  is authorized as  U S WEST
Media Group Common Stock ("Media Stock").
 
    The Communications  Stock  and Media  Stock  provide shareholders  with  two
distinct  securities that are intended  to reflect separately the communications
businesses  of  U  S  WEST  (the  "Communications  Group")  and  the  multimedia
businesses  of U S WEST (the "Media Group" and, together with the Communications
Group, the "Groups").
 
THE COMMUNICATIONS GROUP
 
    The  Communications  Group   primarily  provides  regulated   communications
services  to  more than  25 million  residential and  business customers  in the
Communications Group Region (the  "Region"). The Region  includes the states  of
Arizona,  Colorado, Idaho, Iowa, Minnesota, Montana, Nebraska, New Mexico, North
Dakota, Oregon, South Dakota, Utah, Washington and Wyoming. Services offered  by
the  Communications  Group  include local  telephone  services,  exchange access
services (which  connect  customers to  the  facilities of  carriers,  including
long-distance  providers  and  wireless operators),  and  long-distance services
within  Local  Access  and  Transport   Areas  ("LATAs")  in  the  Region.   The
Communications  Group  provides other  products  and services,  including custom
calling  features,  voice  messaging,  caller  identification,  high-speed  data
applications, customer premises equipment and certain communications services to
business customers and governmental agencies both inside and outside the Region.
The  Telecommunications Act of 1996, enacted into  law on February 8, 1996, will
dramatically alter the competitive landscape of the telecommunications  industry
and  will further  change the nature  of services the  Communications Group will
offer. These future service  offerings include interLATA long-distance  service,
wireless  services, cable  television and  interconnection services  provided to
competing providers of local services.
 
THE MEDIA GROUP
 
    The Media Group is  comprised of: (i)  cable and telecommunications  network
businesses  outside of the Communications Group Region and internationally, (ii)
domestic and international wireless communications network businesses and  (iii)
domestic and international directory and information services businesses.
 
    The Media Group's cable and telecommunications businesses include U S WEST's
investment  in Time  Warner Entertainment  Company L.P.  ("TWE" or  "Time Warner
Entertainment"), the second largest provider of cable television services in the
United States, its cable systems in the Atlanta, Georgia metropolitan area ("the
Atlanta Systems"), and international  cable and telecommunications  investments,
including TeleWest plc ("TeleWest"). In 1995, TeleWest Communications plc merged
its  cable television and  telephony interests with SBC  CableComms (UK) to form
TeleWest, the largest provider of combined cable and telecommunications services
in the  United Kingdom.  The Media  Group also  owns interests  in cable  and/or
telecommunications properties in the Netherlands, Sweden, Norway, Hungary, Czech
Republic, Malaysia and Indonesia.
 
    The   Media  Group  provides   domestic  wireless  communications  services,
including cellular services, in  13 western and midwestern  states to a  rapidly
growing customer base. The Media Group also provides

                    MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF
           FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (CONTINUED)
wireless  communications services internationally through  its Mercury One 2 One
("One 2 One") joint venture,  the world's first personal communications  service
located  in the United Kingdom. The Media  Group also owns interests in wireless
properties in Hungary, the Czech  and Slovak Republics, Russia, Malaysia,  India
and Poland.
 
    The  Media Group's directory and information services businesses develop and
package content  and  information  services,  including  telephone  directories,
database  marketing and other interactive services in domestic and international
markets. The  Media  Group  publishes  more than  300  White  and  Yellow  Pages
directories  in 14 western  and midwestern states and  nearly 200 directories in
the United Kingdom and Poland. The Media Group also has a 50 percent interest in
Listel, Brazil's largest telephone directory publisher.
 
AIRTOUCH MERGER
 
    During  1994,  U  S  WEST  signed  a  definitive  agreement  with   AirTouch
Communications  to combine  their domestic  cellular assets.  The initial equity
ownership of  this  cellular joint  venture  will be  approximately  70  percent
AirTouch  and approximately 30 percent U S WEST. The combination will take place
in two phases.  During Phase I,  which U  S WEST entered  effective November  1,
1995,  the two companies  are operating their  cellular properties separately. A
Wireless Management  Company  (the  "WMC")  has been  formed  and  is  providing
centralized  services  to  both companies  on  a  contract basis.  In  Phase II,
AirTouch and U S WEST will contribute their domestic cellular assets to the WMC.
In this phase,  the Company  will reflect its  share of  the combined  operating
results  of the WMC using the equity method of accounting. The recent passage of
the Telecommunications Act of 1996  has removed significant regulatory  barriers
to  completion of Phase  II of the  business combination. U  S WEST expects that
Phase II closing could take place by the end of 1996 or early 1997.
 
PERSONAL COMMUNICATIONS SERVICES
 
    U S WEST partnered with AirTouch Communications, Bell Atlantic and NYNEX  to
form  a strategic  national wireless  alliance and  formed a  venture to provide
personal communications services ("PCS").  This venture, PCS PrimeCo,  purchased
11  licenses in the Federal Communication  Commission's (the "FCC") PCS auction,
covering 57 million people in Chicago, Dallas, Honolulu, Houston,  Jacksonville,
Miami, Milwaukee, New Orleans, Richmond, San Antonio and Tampa.
 
SUBSEQUENT EVENT
 
    On  February 27, 1996, the Company announced a definitive agreement to merge
with Continental Cablevision,  Inc. ("Continental").  Continental, the  nation's
third-largest cable operator, serves 4.2 million domestic customers, passes more
than  seven  million domestic  homes and  holds  significant other  domestic and
international properties. U S WEST will purchase all of Continental's stock  for
approximately  $5.3  billion  and  will  assume  Continental's  debt  and  other
obligations, which amount to approximately  $5.5 billion. Consideration for  the
$5.3  billion in  equity will consist  of approximately  $1 billion in  U S WEST
preferred stock, convertible to Media Stock; and, at U S WEST's option,  between
$1  billion and $1.5 billion in cash, and $2.8 billion to $3.3 billion in shares
of Media  Stock. The  transaction, which  is  expected to  close in  the  fourth
quarter  of 1996, is subject to a  number of conditions and approvals, including
approvals from  Continental shareholders  and local  franchising and  government
authorities.
 
    Continental's  4.2 million domestic  customers are highly  clustered in five
large markets -- New England,  California, Chicago, Michigan, Ohio and  Florida.
Upon  closing, U S WEST will  own or share management of  cable systems in 60 of
the top  100  American  markets  and  serve nearly  one  of  every  three  cable
households.  In  addition,  Continental  has interests  in  cable  properties in
Australia, Argentina and Singapore; a 10 percent interest in PRIMESTAR (a direct
broadcast  satellite  service);  telephone  access  businesses  in  Florida  and
Virginia;  and interests in programming that include Turner Broadcasting System,
E! Entertainment Television, the Golf Channel, and the Food Channel.

COMMUNICATIONS GROUP
 
    The Communications Group's 1995 income from continuing operations, excluding
the effects  of one-time  items described  in Note  1 to  the table  above,  was
$1,107,  an increase of $8,  or 0.7 percent, compared  with $1,099 in 1994, also
excluding the effects of one-time items. Total revenue growth of 3.4 percent was
largely offset  by  significantly  higher costs  incurred  to  improve  customer
service and meet greater than

           FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (CONTINUED)
expected  business growth. Net income growth will  also be limited in 1996 while
the Communications  Group  continues to  commit  significant resources  to  meet
customer  service  objectives  and  broaden its  range  of  product  and service
offerings.
 
    Excluding the effects  of one-time items  described in Note  1 to the  table
above,  pro forma earnings per Communications Group common share from continuing
operations were $2.35 in 1995.
 
    During 1995, the  Communications Group  refinanced $145  of long-term  debt.
Expenses  associated with the refinancings  resulted in extraordinary charges of
$8, net of tax benefits of $5.
 
MEDIA GROUP
 
    During 1995, income from continuing operations declined 55 percent, to  $59,
excluding  the effects of  the one-time items  described in Note  2 to the table
above. The  decline  is  due  primarily  to  higher  equity  losses  related  to
international   growth  initiatives  and  increased  amortization  and  interest
expense. Interest expense increases relate to debt issued in connection with the
Atlanta Systems  acquisition and  expansion  of international  investments.  The
declines  were  partially offset  by improvement  in  the domestic  cellular and
Yellow Pages operations.
 
    Excluding the effects  of one-time items  described in Note  2 to the  table
above,  pro  forma  earnings  per  Media  Group  common  share  from  continuing
operations were $0.12 in 1995.
 
    During 1995, the Media Group incurred an extraordinary loss of $4, net of  a
tax benefit of $2, related to the early retirement of debt by TWE.

    Approximately 97 percent  of the  revenues of the  Communications Group  are
attributable  to the  operations of  U S  WEST Communications,  Inc. ("U  S WEST
Communications"), of which approximately 59 percent are derived from the  states
of  Arizona, Colorado, Minnesota and Washington. Approximately 29 percent of the
access lines in service are devoted to providing services to business customers.

                    MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF
           FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (CONTINUED)
line growth rate for  business customers, who  tend to be  heavier users of  the
network,  has consistently  exceeded the  growth rate  of residential customers.
During 1995, business  access lines  grew 5.4 percent  while residential  access
lines increased 2.8 percent.
 
    The  primary factors that influence changes  in revenues are customer demand
for products and services, price changes (including those related to  regulatory
proceedings)  and refunds.  During 1995, revenues  from new  product and service
offerings were  $534,  an increase  of  58  percent compared  with  1994.  These
revenues  primarily  consist  of caller  identification,  voice  messaging, call
waiting and high-speed data network transmission services.
 
    Local service revenues include local telephone exchange, local private  line
and  public  telephone  services.  In  1995,  local  service  revenues increased
principally as a  result of  higher demand for  new and  existing services,  and
demand for second lines. Local service revenues from new services increased $92,
or  78  percent,  compared  with 1994.  Reported  total  access  lines increased
511,000, or  3.6  percent, of  which  161,000  were second  lines.  Second  line
installations  increased 25.5 percent compared with 1994. Access line growth was
4.2 percent adjusted for the sale of approximately 95,000 rural telephone access
lines during the last 12 months.
 
    Access charges are collected primarily from interexchange carriers for their
use of the local exchange network. For interstate access services there is  also
a  fee collected directly from telephone  customers. Approximately 33 percent of
access revenues and  11 percent  of total  revenues are  derived from  providing
access services to AT&T.
 
    Higher  revenues from interstate access services  were driven by an increase
of 9.2  percent  in interstate  billed  access  minutes of  use.  The  increased
business  volume more than  offset the effects of  price reductions and refunds.
The Communications Group reduced prices  for interstate access services in  both
1995  and 1994 as  a result of Federal  Communications Commission ("FCC") orders
and competitive pressures. Intrastate access revenues increased primarily due to
the impact  of  increased  business  volume and  multiple  toll  carrier  plans,
partially offset by the impact of rate changes.
 
    Long-distance   revenues  are  derived  from  calls  made  within  the  LATA
boundaries of  the Region.  During 1995  and 1994,  long-distance revenues  were
impacted  by  the implementation  of multiple  toll  carrier plans  ("MTCPs") in
Oregon and Washington in May and July 1994, respectively. The MTCPs  essentially
allow  independent telephone companies to act  as toll carriers. The 1995 impact
of the  MTCPs was  long-distance  revenue losses  of  $62, partially  offset  by
increases  in intrastate access revenues of $12 and decreases in other operating
expenses (i.e.  access expense)  of  $42 compared  with 1994.  These  regulatory
arrangements  have  decreased annual  net income  by approximately  $10. Similar
changes in other states could occur, though the impact on 1996 net income  would
not be material.
 
    Excluding  the effects of the MTCPs, long-distance revenues decreased by 5.9
percent  in  1995,  primarily  due  to  the  effects  of  competition  and  rate
reductions.  Long-distance revenues have declined over the last several years as
customers have migrated to interexchange carriers that have the ability to offer
these services on both an intraLATA  and interLATA basis. A portion of  revenues
lost  to competition, however,  is recovered through access  charges paid by the
interexchange carriers. Erosion  in long-distance revenue  will continue due  to
the loss of 1+ dialing in Minnesota, effective in February 1996, and in Arizona,
effective  in April 1996. Annual  long-distance revenue losses could approximate
$30 as  a  result  of  these changes.  The  Communications  Group  is  partially
mitigating   competitive  losses   through  competitive   pricing  of  intraLATA
long-distance services.
 
    Revenues from other  services primarily  consist of  billing and  collection
services   provided  to   interexchange  carriers,   voice  messaging  services,
high-speed data transmission  services, sales of  service agreements related  to
inside wiring and the provision of customer premises equipment.

                    MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF
           FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (CONTINUED)
 
    During  1995, revenues  from other  services increased  $44, primarily  as a
result of continued market penetration in voice messaging services and sales  of
high-speed  data transmission  services. Revenue  growth from  other services is
also attributable to maintenance contracts for inside wire services and a  large
contract  related to a wire installation project. These increases were partially
offset by a decrease  of $20 in revenues  from billing and collection  services.
The  decline in  billing and collection  revenues is primarily  related to lower
contract prices and a decrease in the volume of services provided to AT&T.

  The  Company's  paging  business  was  sold  in  June  1994.  Results  reflect
  operations for the six months ending June 30, 1994.
 
    Media  Group sales  and other  revenues increased  15 percent,  to $2,374 in
1995, excluding the effects of the  1994 Atlanta Systems acquisition and  paging
sale.  The  increase was  primarily  due to  strong  growth in  cellular service
revenue.
 
    DIRECTORY AND  INFORMATION  SERVICES    Revenues  related  to  Yellow  Pages
directory  advertising increased  6.4 percent  to $1,026  in 1995,  due to price
increases of  4.5 percent,  higher revenue  per advertiser  and an  increase  in
Yellow Pages advertising volume.
 
    International directory publishing revenues increased $44 in 1995, primarily
due  to  U S  WEST's  May 1994  purchase of  Thomson  Directories in  the United
Kingdom. The remaining increase is due to an increase in advertisers and revenue
per advertiser.
 
    WIRELESS COMMUNICATIONS  Cellular service revenues increased 34 percent,  to
$845 in 1995, due to a 51 percent increase in subscribers during the last twelve
months  (with  20 percent  of the  additions  occurring in  December), partially
offset by a  13 percent drop  in average  revenue per subscriber  to $60.00  per
month.  The increase  in subscribers relates  to continued growth  in demand for
wireless  services.  The  Media  Group  anticipates  continued  growth  in   its
subscriber base, although at slightly decreased rates.
 
    New distribution programs are being developed which increase availability of
cellular  products and simplify  the cellular service  activation process. These
programs have contributed to the shift  in the customer base from businesses  to
consumers.  This  shift, combined  with competitive  pressures on  pricing, will
cause the average revenue per subscriber to continue to decline.

           FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (CONTINUED)
 
    Cellular equipment  revenues decreased  20 percent,  to $96  in 1995,  as  a
result  of lower cellular equipment costs. These lower equipment costs are being
passed on to retailers and to new customers. The Media Group expects this  trend
to  continue  in 1996  as  the cost  of equipment  continues  to decline  and as
penetration into the consumer market increases.
 
    Revenues related to the paging sales and service operations, which were sold
in 1994, approximated $28 in 1994.
 
    CABLE AND TELECOMMUNICATIONS  Domestic cable and telecommunications revenues
increased $197 in  1995, due  to the December  1994 acquisition  of the  Atlanta
Systems.

EMPLOYEE-RELATED EXPENSES
 
    Employee-related  expenses  include  basic  salaries  and  wages,  overtime,
benefits (including pension and health care), payroll taxes and contract  labor.
During  1995, improving  customer service  was the  Communications Group's first
priority. Overtime payments and contract labor expense associated with  customer
service initiatives at the Communications Group increased employee-related costs
by  approximately $168 compared  with 1994. Expenses related  to the addition of
approximately 1,700  employees  in 1995  and  1,000  employees in  1994  at  the
Communications  Group also increased employee-related costs. These expenses were
incurred to handle the  higher than anticipated volume  of business and to  meet
new  business  opportunities. Partially  offsetting  these increases  was  a $34
reduction in the accrual for postretirement  benefits, a $22 decrease in  travel
expense and reduced expenses related to employee separations under reengineering
and  streamlining  initiatives. The  Communications Group  will continue  to add
employees to address customer  service issues and growth  in the core  business.
Costs  related to these work-force additions  will partially offset the benefits
of employee  separations  achieved through  restructuring.  (See  "Restructuring
Charge.")
 
    Employee-related  expenses also increased  due to the  1994 purchases of the
Atlanta Systems and Thomson Directories, and growth initiatives in the directory
and information services segment.
 
OTHER OPERATING EXPENSES
 
    Other operating expenses include access charges (incurred for the routing of
long-distance traffic through the facilities of independent companies),  network
software  expenses, wireless  marketing and  operating costs,  and marketing and
related costs  associated  with publishing  activities.  The increase  in  other
operating  expenses is primarily attributed to  the Media Group's 1994 purchases
of the Atlanta  Systems and Thomson  Directories and expansion  of the  cellular
customer base.
 
    During  1995, other operating expenses decreased at the Communications Group
primarily due to the effects of the multiple toll carrier plans and a  reduction
in  expenses related  to project funding  at Bell  Communications Research, Inc.
("Bellcore"), of  which U  S  WEST Communications  has a  one-seventh  ownership
interest.  These decreases in other operating  expenses were partially offset by
increases in costs  associated with  increased sales of  products and  services,
including bad debt expense.

           FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (CONTINUED)
 
TAXES OTHER THAN INCOME TAXES
 
    Taxes  other than income  taxes, which consist  primarily of property taxes,
were relatively flat  compared with  1994. Increased taxes  associated with  the
domestic  cellular operations were  offset by lower  taxes at the Communications
Group. Lower taxes at the Communications  Group were primarily due to  favorable
property  tax valuations and mill  levies as compared with  1994. As a result of
these  valuations  and  mill  levies,   1995  fourth-quarter  accruals  at   the
Communications Group decreased by $20 compared with fourth-quarter 1994.
 
DEPRECIATION AND AMORTIZATION
 
    Increased  depreciation  and amortization  expense  was attributable  to the
effects of  a  higher  depreciable  asset  base  at  the  Communications  Group,
expansion of the Media Group's domestic cellular network and the purchase of the
Atlanta  Systems. These  increases were partially  offset by the  effects of the
sales of certain rural telephone exchanges at U S WEST Communications.
 
INTEREST EXPENSE AND OTHER
 
    Interest expense increased primarily as a result of increased debt financing
at the  Communications  Group, the  December  1994 acquisition  of  the  Atlanta
Systems,  new domestic and  international investments and  a reclassification of
debt from net investment in assets held for sale. The average borrowing cost was
6.7 percent in  1995, compared  with 6.6 percent  in 1994.  (See "Liquidity  and
Capital Resources.")
 
    Equity  losses increased $86 in 1995, primarily  due to costs related to the
expansion of  the  network  and  additional  financing  costs  at  TeleWest  and
additional  costs associated with the significant increase in customers at One 2
One. Start-up  and  other costs  associated  with new  international  cable  and
telecommunications  investments  primarily  located in  the  Czech  Republic and
Malaysia contributed  to the  increase. These  increased losses  were  partially
offset  by  earnings  in the  European  wireless operations.  Losses  related to
domestic investments in  TWE and  PCS PrimeCo  also increased.  The Media  Group
expects  the PCS  partnership to  experience several  years of  operating losses
associated with the start-up phase of the PCS business.
 
    The decrease  in  other income  is  largely  attributable to  $17  of  costs
associated  with the Recapitalization Plan  in 1995, increased minority interest
expense associated with domestic cellular operations and a 1994 gain on sale  of
nonstrategic operations.

</TABLE>
 
    The  increase in  the effective  tax rate  reflects the  impacts of goodwill
amortization related to the acquisition of the Atlanta Systems, higher state and
foreign income taxes,  and expenses associated  with the Recapitalization  Plan.
Additionally,  a tax benefit was recorded in 1994, related to the sale of paging
assets, which  contributed to  the increase  in the  effective tax  rate.  These
impacts  were  partially offset  by lower  pretax  income and  the effects  of a
research and experimentation credit, and adjustments for prior periods.
 
RESTRUCTURING CHARGE
 
    U S  WEST's  1993  results  reflected  a  $1  billion  restructuring  charge
(pretax).  The related restructuring plan (the "Restructuring Plan") is designed
to provide faster, more responsive customer services while reducing the costs of
providing these services.  As part  of the  Restructuring Plan,  the Company  is
developing  new systems and enhanced system functionality that will enable it to
monitor networks to reduce the risk of service interruptions, activate telephone
service   on    demand,   rapidly    design    and   engineer    products    and

services  for customers,  and centralize  its service  centers. The  Company has
consolidated its 560 customer service centers at U S WEST Communications into 26
centers in  10 cities  and plans  on reducing  its work  force by  approximately
10,000  employees.  All service  centers are  operational  and supported  by new
systems and enhanced system functionality.
 
    The Restructuring Plan is expected to  be substantially complete by the  end
of 1997. Implementation of the Restructuring Plan has been impacted by growth in
the  business and related service  issues, new business opportunities, revisions
to system  delivery  schedules  and  productivity issues  caused  by  the  major
rearrangement  of resources due to restructuring.  These issues will continue to
affect the timing of employee separations.
 
    The Company estimates  that full  implementation of  the 1993  Restructuring
Plan  will reduce employee-related expenses by  approximately $400 per year. The
savings related  to work-force  reductions  will be  offset  by the  effects  of
inflation and a variety of other factors. These factors include costs related to
the achievement of customer service objectives and increased demand for existing
services. (See "Employee-Related Expenses.")

- ------------------------------
(1)
  Employee  separation  costs, including  the  balance of  a  1991 restructuring
  reserve at December 31, 1993, aggregate $316.
 
    Employee separation costs include  severance payments, health-care  coverage
and  postemployment education  benefits. Systems  development costs  include new
systems and  the  application  of enhanced  system  functionality  to  existing,
single-purpose  systems to provide integrated, end-to-end customer service. Real
estate costs  include  preparation  costs  for  the  new  service  centers.  The
relocation  and  retraining costs  are related  to moving  employees to  the new
service centers and retraining employees on the methods and systems required  in
the new, restructured mode of operation.
 
    EMPLOYEE  SEPARATION  Under the  Restructuring Plan, the Company anticipates
the separation  of 10,000  employees. Approximately  1,000 employees  that  were
originally  expected to relocate have chosen separation or other job assignments
and have been  replaced. This increased  the number of  employee separations  to
10,000  from  9,000,  and  increased  the  estimated  total  cost  for  employee
separations to $316 from $286, as  compared with the original estimate. The  $30
cost associated with these additional employee separations was reclassified from
relocation to the reserve for employee separations during 1995.

  Includes the remaining  employees and the  separation amounts associated  with
  the balance of a 1991 restructuring reserve at December 31, 1993.
 
(2)
  A  significant number of the employee reductions originally scheduled for 1996
  will be  delayed while  the  Company focuses  on overtime  and  contract-labor
  expenses.  The Restructuring Plan is expected  to be substantially complete by
  the end of 1997.
 
    Compared with  the original  estimates,  employee reduction  and  separation
amounts  shown above have been  reduced by 1,600 employees  and $51 in 1996, and
increased by 4,495 employees and $129 in 1997.
 
    SYSTEMS DEVELOPMENT    The  existing  information  management  systems  were
largely  developed  to  support  a  monopoly  environment.  These  systems  were
inadequate due to the effects of increased competition, new forms of  regulation
and  changing  technology  that have  driven  consumer demand  for  products and
services that can be delivered  quickly, reliably and economically. The  Company
believes  that  improved  customer  service, delivered  at  lower  cost,  can be
achieved by a combination  of new systems and  introducing new functionality  to
existing  systems. This is a change from  the initial strategy which placed more
emphasis on the development of new systems.
 
    The systems development  program involves  new systems  and enhanced  system
functionality for systems that support the following core processes:
 
        SERVICE  DELIVERY -- to  support service on demand  for all products and
    services. These new  systems and enhanced  system functionality will  permit
    customer  calls to be directed to those service representatives who can meet
    their requirements. This  process will provide  enhanced information to  the
    service  representatives regarding the customer  requests and the ability of
    the Communications Group to fulfill them.
 
        SERVICE ASSURANCE --  for performance monitoring  from one location  and
    remote   testing  in  the  new  environment,  including  identification  and
    resolution of faults prior to customer impact.
 
        CAPACITY PROVISIONING  --  for  integrated planning  of  future  network
    capacity,  including  the  installation  of  software  controllable  service
    components.

                    MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF
           FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (CONTINUED)
 
    Certain of  the new  systems  and enhanced  system functionality  have  been
implemented  in  the service  centers  and have  simplified  the labor-intensive
interfaces between systems  processes in  existence prior  to the  Restructuring
Plan.  Enhanced  system functionality  introduced  under the  Restructuring Plan
since its inception includes the following:
 
    - The ability to  determine facilities' availability  while the customer  is
      placing an order;
 
    - Automated  engineering of central office facilities and automated updating
      of central office facilities' records;
 
    - The ability to track  the status of complex  network design jobs from  the
      customer's perspective; and
 
    - Systems  that  accurately  diagnose network  problems  and  prepare repair
      packages to correct the problems identified.
 
    The direct, incremental and nonrecurring costs of providing new systems  and
enhanced system functionality follow:

    Systems  expenses charged to current  operations consist of costs associated
with  the  information  management  function,  including  planning,  developing,
testing  and maintaining databases for general purpose computers, in addition to
systems costs related  to maintenance of  telephone network applications.  Other
systems  expenses are  for administrative  (i.e. general  purpose) systems which
include customer service, order entry, billing and collection, accounts payable,
payroll, human resources and property records. Ongoing systems costs at U S WEST
Communications comprised approximately six  percent of total operating  expenses
in  1995, 1994 and  1993. The Company  expects systems costs  charged to current
operations as a percent of total  operating expenses to approximate the  current
level  throughout 1996. Systems costs could increase relative to other operating
costs as the business becomes more technology dependent.

COMMUNICATIONS GROUP
 
    The Communications  Group's  1994  income  from  continuing  operations  was
$1,099,  an increase of $120, or 12.3 percent, over 1993, excluding the one-time
effects described  in Note  1 to  the table  above. The  increase was  primarily
attributable to increased demand for telecommunications services.
 
    In  1993, U  S WEST  Communications incurred  extraordinary charges  for the
discontinuance of Statement of Accounting Standards ("SFAS") No. 71, "Accounting
for the Effects of Certain Types of Regulation," and the early extinguishment of
debt. An extraordinary, noncash charge of $3.1 billion (after tax) was  incurred
in conjunction with the decision to discontinue accounting for the operations of
U  S WEST Communications in  accordance with SFAS No.  71. SFAS No. 71 generally
applies to  regulated  companies that  meet  certain requirements,  including  a
requirement   that  a  company  be  able   to  recover  its  costs,  competition
notwithstanding,  by  charging  its  customers  at  prices  established  by  its
regulators.  This decision  to discontinue  the application  of SFAS  No. 71 was
based on  the  belief  that competition,  market  conditions  and  technological
advances,  more than prices established by regulators, will determine the future
cost recovery  by U  S WEST  Communications. As  a result  of this  change,  the
remaining asset lives of U S WEST

Communications'  telephone  plant were  shortened  to more  closely  reflect the
useful (economic) lives of such plant.  U S WEST Communications' accounting  and
reporting for regulatory purposes were not affected by the change.
 
    During  1993,  U  S  WEST Communications  refinanced  long-term  debt issues
aggregating $2.7 billion  in principal  amount. These refinancings  allowed U  S
WEST Communications to take advantage of favorable interest rates. Extraordinary
costs associated with the redemptions reduced 1993 income by $77 (after tax).
 
MEDIA GROUP
 
    During  1994,  income from  continuing operations  decreased 19  percent, to
$130, excluding the effects  of the one-time  items described in  Note 2 to  the
table  above. The decline in income is  primarily a result of increased start-up
losses associated  with international  businesses,  partially offset  by  income
growth  in domestic wireless operations attributable to rapid growth in customer
demand.
 
    During 1993, the  Board approved  a plan to  dispose of  the capital  assets
segment,  which  includes activities  related  to financial  services, financial
guarantee insurance  operations and  real  estate. Until  January 1,  1995,  the
capital   assets  segment  was  accounted  for  as  discontinued  operations  in
accordance with Accounting Principles Board  Opinion No. 30, which provides  for
the  reporting of  the operating  results of  discontinued operations separately
from continuing operations. The Company recorded a provision of $100 (after tax)
for the  estimated  loss on  disposal  of  the discontinued  operations  and  an
additional  provision of $20 to reflect  the cumulative effect on deferred taxes
of the  1993  federally mandated  increase  in  income tax  rates.  Income  from
discontinued  operations prior to  June 1, 1993,  was $38, net  of $15 in income
taxes. Income from discontinued operations subsequent to June 1, 1993, is  being
deferred  and was  included within  the provision  for loss  on disposal  of the
capital assets segment.

    In  1994, local service revenues increased principally as a result of higher
demand for services. Reported access  lines increased by 3.6 percent.  Excluding
the  sale  of approximately  60,000 rural  telephone  access lines  during 1994,
access line growth was 4.0 percent.

                    MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF
           FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (CONTINUED)
 
    Higher revenues from interstate access services were primarily  attributable
to  an increase of 7.8 percent in interstate billed access minutes of use, which
more than  offset the  effects  of price  decreases. Intrastate  access  charges
increased  primarily as a result of  higher demand, including demand for private
line services.
 
    Long-distance revenues decreased principally due to the effects of the MTCPs
implemented in Oregon  and Washington.  The 1994  impact was  a loss  of $68  in
long-distance revenues, partially offset by a decrease of $48 in other operating
expenses  and an increase of $10  in intrastate access revenue. These regulatory
arrangements decreased net income by approximately $6 in 1994.
 
    During 1994, revenues from  other services increased  due to higher  revenue
from  billing and  collection services and  increased market  penetration of new
service offerings. Partially offsetting the increase in other services  revenues
was  the 1993 sale of telephone equipment distribution operations, completion of
large telephone network installation contracts  and lower revenue from  customer
premises equipment installations.

  The  Company's  paging  business  was  sold  in  June  1994.  Results  reflect
  operations for the six months ending June 30, 1994.
 
    During 1994, Media Group  sales and other revenues  increased 25 percent  to
$1,862,  excluding the effect of the 1994 Atlanta Systems acquisition and paging
sale. The  increase was  primarily  due to  strong  growth in  cellular  service
revenue.
 
    DIRECTORY  AND  INFORMATION  SERVICES    Revenues  related  to  Yellow Pages
directory advertising increased approximately $59, or 6.5 percent, due primarily
to pricing. Product enhancements and  the effect of improved marketing  programs
on  business volume  also contributed  to the  increase in  revenues. Non-Yellow
Pages revenues increased $11,  including $7 related  to new products.  Partially
offsetting  these  increases  was the  absence  of revenues  related  to certain
publishing, software development and marketing operations that were sold,  which
reduced revenues by $22.
 
    The  increase in international directory  publishing revenue is attributable
to U S WEST's May 1994 purchase of Thomson Directories.

    WIRELESS COMMUNICATIONS  Cellular service revenues increased 43 percent,  to
$633  in 1994, due to  a 61 percent increase in  subscribers (with 24 percent of
the additions occurring in December), partially  offset by an 8 percent drop  in
average revenue per subscriber to $70.00 per month.
 
    Cellular equipment revenues increased 90 percent, to $120 in 1994, primarily
due  to  an 83  percent  increase in  gross  customer additions,  with  a higher
percentage of those customers purchasing  equipment than in 1993. This  increase
was  partially offset by  a 13 percent  decline in the  average selling price of
wireless phones.
 
    CABLE AND TELECOMMUNICATIONS  Domestic cable and telecommunications revenues
reflect the December 1994 acquisition of the Atlanta Systems.

</TABLE>
 
    A reduction in the  pension credit of approximately  $80 contributed to  the
increase  in  employee-related  expenses. Actuarial  assumptions,  which include
decreases in the discount rate and the expected long-term rate of return on plan
assets, contributed  to the  pension credit  reduction. Approximately  $150  for
overtime  payments, contract labor and basic  salaries and wages, all related to
the implementation of the  Restructuring Plan at U  S WEST Communications,  also
contributed  to  the increase.  Additionally,  employee-related expenses  at the
Company's  publishing  operations  increased  in  connection  with  new  product
initiatives.  Partially offsetting these increases were the effects of employees
leaving the  Company under  the Restructuring  Plan, lower  health-care  benefit
costs,  including a  reduction in the  accrual for  postretirement benefits, and
lower incentive compensation payments to employees.
 
    Selling and  other  operating  costs  related  to  growth  in  the  cellular
subscriber  base  increased other  operating expenses  by approximately  $166 in
1994. Partially offsetting this  increase was a $48  decrease in access  expense
related to the effects of the multiple toll carrier plan arrangements.
 
    The increase in depreciation and amortization expense was primarily a result
of  a higher depreciable asset  base and increased rates  of depreciation at U S
WEST Communications.
 
    Interest expense in  1994 was essentially  unchanged from 1993.  Incremental
financing costs associated with the September 1993 TWE investment were offset by
the   effects  of  refinancing  debt  at  lower  rates  in  1993  at  U  S  WEST
Communications, and a  reclassification of capitalized  interest in 1994.  Since
the  discontinuance  of SFAS  No.  71, interest  capitalized  as a  component of
telephone plant construction is recorded  as an offset against interest  expense
rather  than  to  other income  (expense).  U  S WEST's  average  borrowing cost
decreased to 6.6 percent in 1994, from 6.7 percent in 1993.
 
    Equity losses in unconsolidated ventures increased over 1993, primarily  due
to  start-up costs  related to  the build  out of  TeleWest's network  and costs
related to the expansion of the customer base at One 2 One.

           FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (CONTINUED)
 
    Other income  increased  over 1993  primarily  due  to an  increase  in  the
management  fee associated with the  Company's TWE investment and  a gain on the
sale of certain publishing operations, partially offset by the  reclassification
of capitalized interest to interest expense.

</TABLE>
 
    The  increase in the effective tax  rate resulted primarily from the effects
of discontinuing SFAS No. 71, an increase in 1994 income before income taxes and
the 1993  restructuring charge,  partially offset  by the  cumulative effect  on
deferred  income taxes  of the  1993 federally  mandated increase  in income tax
rates.
 
LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES -- THREE YEARS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 1995
 
OPERATING ACTIVITIES
 
    Cash provided by operations increased $173  in 1995. Business growth in  the
Communications  Group  and the  cellular business,  and  the acquisition  of the
Atlanta Systems contributed to the increase in cash provided by operations. This
increase was partially  offset by increases  in Restructuring Plan  expenditures
and higher income tax and interest payments, including approximately $60 related
to the partial sale of the Company's joint venture interest in TeleWest.
 
    Cash  from operations in  1994 remained relatively  flat compared with 1993.
Business growth and a decrease in  the cash funding for postretirement  benefits
was offset by increased Restructuring Plan payments.
 
INVESTING ACTIVITIES
 
    Total capital expenditures were $3,140 in 1995, $2,820 in 1994 and $2,441 in
1993. The 1995 capital expenditures exceeded the 1994 and 1993 levels due to the
Communications Group's efforts to improve customer service (including reductions
in held orders) and to accommodate additional line capability in several states,
and  the enhancement  and expansion  of the  cellular network.  In 1996, capital
expenditures are  expected to  approximate $3.1  billion. Included  in the  1996
capital  expenditures estimate are  costs to enter new  markets as allowed under
the Telecommunications Act of 1996, upgrade  the Atlanta Systems and expand  the
cellular network.
 
    The  Company  received cash  proceeds  of $214  and  $93 in  1995  and 1994,
respectively,  for  the  sales  of  certain  rural  telephone  exchanges.  Since
implementing  its rural telephone  exchange sales program,  the Company has sold
approximately 155,000 access lines.  Planned sales of  rural exchanges for  1996
and beyond aggregate approximately 180,000 lines.
 
    Investing  activities  of the  Company  also include  equity  investments in
international ventures.  In 1995,  the Company  invested $681  in  international
ventures, primarily investments in Malaysia, the Netherlands, the Czech Republic
and  the United Kingdom.  The Company invested  approximately $444 in developing
international  businesses  in  1994,   including  the  acquisition  of   Thomson
Directories.  The Company anticipates that investments in international ventures
will approximate $400 in  1996. This includes  investments for recently  awarded
licenses  to  provide cellular  service using  digital  technology in  India and
Poland. At December 31, 1995, U S  WEST guaranteed debt in the principal  amount
of approximately $140 related to international ventures.
 
    In  March 1995,  PCS PrimeCo  was awarded  PCS licenses  in 11  markets. The
Company's share of the cost of the licenses was approximately $268, all of which
was funded in 1995. Under the PCS PrimeCo partnership

                    MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF
           FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (CONTINUED)
agreement, U  S  WEST  is required  to  fund  approximately 24  percent  of  PCS
PrimeCo's  operating  and capital  costs, including  licensing  costs. U  S WEST
anticipates that its total  funding obligations to PCS  PrimeCo during the  next
three years will be approximately $400.
 
    In  1994, the Company  received cash proceeds  of $143 from  the sale of its
paging operations. In 1993, cash proceeds of $30 were received from the sale  of
certain  nonstrategic lines of  business. The Company did  not receive cash from
the 1994 partial sale of its joint venture interest in TeleWest or from the 1995
merger. All proceeds from the 1994 sale  have been used by TeleWest for  general
business  purposes, including  financing both  construction and  operations, and
repaying debt.
 
    On February 27,  1996, U S  West announced a  definitive agreement to  merge
with Continental. Continental, the nation's third-largest cable operator, serves
4.2  million domestic customers,  passes more than  seven million domestic homes
and holds significant other domestic and international properties. U S WEST will
purchase all  of Continental's  stock for  approximately $5.3  billion and  will
assume  Continental's debt and other  obligations, which amount to approximately
$5.5 billion.  Consideration for  the $5.3  billion in  equity will  consist  of
approximately  $1  billion in  U S  WEST preferred  stock, convertible  to Media
Stock; and, at U S WEST's option,  between $1 billion and $1.5 billion in  cash,
and  $2.8 billion  to $3.3  billion in shares  of Media  Stock. The transaction,
which is expected to close in the fourth quarter of 1996, is subject to a number
of conditions and approvals,  including approvals from Continental  shareholders
and local franchising and government authorities.
 
FINANCING ACTIVITIES
 
    During  1995, debt increased  $917 primarily due to  the increase in capital
expenditures, new investments in international ventures, cash funding of the PCS
licenses and a reclassification of debt  from net investment in assets held  for
sale.
 
    During  fourth-quarter 1995, U S WEST  issued $130 of exchangeable notes, or
Debt Exchangeable  for  Common  Stock  ("DECS"), due  December  15,  1998.  Upon
maturity,  each DECS  will be mandatorily  exchanged by  U S WEST  for shares of
Enhance Financial Services  Group, Inc. ("Enhance")  or, at U  S WEST's  option,
redeemed  at the  cash equivalent.  The capital  assets segment  currently holds
approximately 31.5 percent of the outstanding Enhance common stock.
 
    These increases in debt were partially offset by reductions of debt  related
to  the  investment in  TWE and  a  refinancing of  commercial paper  by issuing
Company-obligated mandatorily redeemable  preferred securities  of a  subsidiary
trust holding solely Company-guaranteed debentures ("Preferred Securities"). U S
WEST  issued $600 of Preferred  Securities in 1995. The  payment of interest and
redemption amounts to holders  of the securities  are fully and  unconditionally
guaranteed by U S WEST.
 
    During  1995, U S WEST  refinanced $2.6 billion of  commercial paper to take
advantage of favorable long-term interest  rates. In addition to the  commercial
paper,  U S WEST Communications refinanced $145  of long-term debt. In 1993, U S
WEST  Communications  refinanced  $2.7  billion  of  long-term  debt.   Expenses
associated  with  the refinancing  of long-term  debt resulted  in extraordinary
after-tax charges to income of $8 and $77, net of tax benefits of $5 and $48  in
1995 and 1993, respectively.
 
    Debt  increased $739 in 1994, primarily due to the December 1994 acquisition
of the Atlanta Systems,  partially offset by reductions  in debt related to  the
investment in TWE. The cash investment related to the acquisition of the Atlanta
Systems was $745, obtained through short-term borrowing.
 
    Excluding  debt associated  with the  capital assets  segment, the Company's
percentage of  debt to  total capital  at December  31, 1995,  was 50.7  percent
compared with 51.6 percent at December 31, 1994 and 55.1 percent at December 31,
1993.  Including  debt associated  with  the capital  assets  segment, Preferred
Securities and other preferred stock, the Company's percentage of debt to  total
capital was 56.4 percent at

December  31,  1995, 55.7  percent  at December  31,  1994 and  59.7  percent at
December 31, 1993. The decrease in the 1994 percentage of debt to total  capital
is primarily attributable to higher net income and the effects of an increase in
common shares outstanding.
 
    U  S WEST  maintains a commercial  paper program to  finance short-term cash
flow requirements  as well  as to  maintain a  presence in  the short-term  debt
market.   In  addition,  U   S  WEST  maintains   lines  of  credit  aggregating
approximately $1.9 billion,  all of which  was available at  December 31,  1995.
Under  registration statements filed with the SEC,  as of December 31, 1995, U S
WEST is  permitted  to  issue up  to  approximately  $1.5 billion  of  new  debt
securities.
 
    Debt  related to discontinued operations decreased  $487 in 1995 and $213 in
1994. Cash to the capital assets segment of $101 in 1994 primarily reflects  the
payment  of debt, net of $154 in proceeds from the sale of 8.1 million shares of
Financial Security  Assurance  Holdings,  Ltd. ("FSA"),  an  investment  of  the
capital  assets segment.  For financial reporting  purposes debt  of the capital
assets segment is netted against the related assets. See Consolidated  Financial
Statements -- Note 20: Net Investment in Assets Held for Sale.
 
    In  connection with U S  WEST's February 27, 1996  announcement of a planned
merger with Continental,  U S WEST,  Inc.'s credit rating  is being reviewed  by
credit  rating agencies, which may result in a downgrading. The credit rating of
U S  WEST  Communications was  not  placed under  review  by Moody's,  has  been
reaffirmed  by Duff  and Phelps,  and is  under review  by Fitch  and Standard &
Poors.
 
    Subsequent to the  acquisition of  the Atlanta Systems  (See Note  4 to  the
Consolidated  Financial  Statements)  the  Company  announced  its  intention to
purchase U S  WEST common shares  in the open  market up to  an amount equal  to
those  issued in conjunction with the acquisition, subject to market conditions.
In first-quarter 1995, the Company purchased 1,704,700 shares of U S WEST common
stock at an average  price per share  of $37.02. In  December 1994, the  Company
purchased  550,400 shares of U S WEST common stock at an average price per share
of $36.30.
 
RISK MANAGEMENT
 
    The Company is  exposed to  market risks  arising from  changes in  interest
rates  and foreign exchange rates. Derivative  financial instruments are used to
manage these risks. U S WEST  does not use derivative financial instruments  for
trading purposes.
 
INTEREST RATE RISK MANAGEMENT
 
    The  objective of the  interest rate risk management  program is to minimize
the total cost  of debt. Interest  rate swaps are  used to adjust  the ratio  of
fixed-  to variable-rate debt. The market value of the debt portfolio, including
the interest rate swaps, is monitored and compared with predetermined benchmarks
to evaluate the effectiveness of the risk management program.
 
    Notional amounts of  interest rate  swaps outstanding were  $1.6 billion  at
December  31,  1995 and  1994, with  various maturities  extending to  2004. The
estimated effect  of interest  rate derivative  transactions was  to adjust  the
level  of  fixed-rate debt  from  88 percent  to 94  percent  of the  total debt
portfolio at December 31, 1995, and from  73 percent to 82 percent of the  total
debt  portfolio at December 31, 1994 (including debt associated with the capital
assets segment).
 
    In conjunction with the 1993 debt refinancing, the Company executed  forward
contracts  to  sell U.S.  Treasury  bonds to  lock in  the  U. S.  Treasury rate
component of  $1.5 billion  of the  future  debt issue.  At December  31,  1995,
deferred  credits of $8 and deferred charges  of $51 on closed forward contracts
are included as part of the carrying value of the underlying debt. The  deferred
credits  and charges are being recognized as a yield adjustment over the life of
the debt, which matures at various  dates through 2043. The net deferred  charge
is directly offset by the lower coupon rate achieved on the new debt.

                    MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF
           FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (CONTINUED)
 
FOREIGN EXCHANGE RISK MANAGEMENT
 
    U  S WEST has entered into forward and option contracts to manage the market
risks associated with fluctuations in foreign exchange rates after consideration
of offsetting  foreign  exposures among  international  operations. The  use  of
forward  and option  contracts allow U  S WEST  to fix or  cap the  cost of firm
foreign investment commitments in countries with freely convertible  currencies.
The  market  values of  the foreign  exchange  positions, including  the hedging
instruments, are continuously monitored  and compared with predetermined  levels
of acceptable risk.
 
    Notional   amounts  of   foreign  exchange  forward   and  option  contracts
outstanding were $456 and $170 as  of December 31, 1995 and 1994,  respectively,
with  maturities of  one year  or less. These  contracts were  primarily for the
purchase of Dutch  guilders and  British pounds in  1995 and  British pounds  in
1994.
 
    The   Company   had  foreign   exchange  risks   associated  with   a  Dutch
guilder-denominated payable  in  the  translated principal  amount  of  $216  at
December  31, 1995, and British  pound-denominated receivables in the translated
principal amounts of $139 and $48  at December 31, 1995 and 1994,  respectively,
of  which  $63 and  $48 of  these respective  balances are  with a  wholly owned
subsidiary. These positions were hedged in 1995.
 
DISPOSITION OF THE CAPITAL ASSETS SEGMENT
 
    U S WEST announced a  plan of disposition of  the capital assets segment  in
June  1993. See the Consolidated Financial Statements -- Note 20: Net Investment
in Assets Held for Sale. In December 1993, U S WEST sold $2.0 billion of finance
receivables and the business of U S WEST Financial Services, Inc. to NationsBank
Corporation. Proceeds from the sale of  $2.1 billion were used to repay  related
debt.
 
    During 1994, U S WEST reduced its ownership interest in FSA, a member of the
capital  assets segment, to 60.9 percent and its voting interest to 49.8 percent
through a  series of  transactions. In  May and  June 1994,  U S  WEST sold  8.1
million  shares of FSA common  stock and received $154  in net proceeds from the
public offering. In December 1995, FSA merged with Capital Guaranty  Corporation
for  shares of FSA and cash of  $51. The transaction was valued at approximately
$203 and reduced U S  WEST's ownership interest in FSA  to 50.3 percent and  its
voting  interest to 41.7  percent. U S  WEST expects to  monetize and ultimately
reduce its ownership in FSA through the issuance of Debt Exchangeable for Common
Stock ("DECS") in 1996. At maturity, each DECS will be mandatorily exchanged  by
U  S WEST  for FSA  common stock  held by  U S  WEST or,  at U  S WEST's option,
redeemed at the cash equivalent.
 
    On September 2, 1994, U S WEST issued to Fund American Enterprises  Holdings
Inc.  ("FFC") 50,000 shares of cumulative redeemable preferred stock for a total
of $50. The shares are mandatorily redeemable in year ten and, at the option  of
FFC, the preferred stock also can be redeemed for common shares of FSA.
 
    U  S WEST Real Estate, Inc. has  sold various properties totaling $120, $327
and $66 in 1995, 1994  and 1993, respectively. The  sales proceeds were in  line
with  estimates.  Proceeds  from building  sales  were primarily  used  to repay
related debt. U S WEST has  completed construction of existing buildings in  the
commercial   real  estate  portfolio  and   expects  to  substantially  complete
liquidation of this portfolio by 1998.  The remaining balance of assets  subject
to sale is approximately $490, net of reserves, as of December 31, 1995.
 
COMPETITIVE AND REGULATORY ENVIRONMENT
 
THE TELECOMMUNICATIONS ACT OF 1996
 
    On  February 1, 1996,  the House and  Senate approved the Telecommunications
Act of 1996 (the  "1996 Act") which is  intended to promote competition  between
local   telephone  companies,   long-distance  carriers   and  cable  television
operators. The 1996 Act was  signed into law on  February 8, 1996, and  replaces
the  antitrust consent decree that  broke up the "Bell  System" in 1984. A major
provision of the legislation includes  the preemption of state regulations  that
govern competition by allowing local telephone companies,
 
                                      B-22

                    MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF
           FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (CONTINUED)
long-distance  carriers  and cable  television companies  to enter  each other's
lines of business. Consequently, the Regional Bell Operating Companies ("RBOCs")
are immediately permitted to offer wireline interLATA toll services out of their
regions. However, to  participate in the  interLATA long-distance market  within
their   regions,   the  RBOCs   must  first   open   their  local   networks  to
facilities-based competition by satisfying a detailed checklist of requirements,
including requirements related to interconnection and number portability.
 
    Other key provisions of the 1996  Act: (1) eliminate most of the  regulation
of  cable  television  rates  within  three  years  and  eliminate  the  ban  on
cross-ownership between  cable  television  and  telephone  companies  in  small
communities;  (2) permit  the RBOCs  to develop  new, competitive  cable systems
within their regions and to acquire or build wireless cable systems; (3) provide
partial relief from the  ban against manufacturing telecommunications  equipment
by  the  RBOCs; and  (4)  permit wireless  operators  to provide  interLATA toll
service in and out of region without a separate subsidiary and to jointly market
or resell cellular service.
 
    The FCC and state  regulators have been given  latitude in interpreting  and
overseeing   the  implementation  of   this  legislation,  including  developing
universal service funding policy. The  extent and timing of future  competition,
including  the  Communications  Group's  ability  to  offer  in-region interLATA
long-distance services, will  depend in  part on  the implementation  guidelines
determined  by the FCC and state  regulators, and how quickly the Communications
Group can  satisfy  requirements  of the  checklist.  The  Communications  Group
estimates  that fulfillment  of the  checklist requirements  could occur  in the
majority of its states within 12 to 18 months.
 
THE COMMUNICATIONS GROUP
 
    Markets served by  the Communications  Group, including  markets for  local,
access and long-distance services, are being impacted by the rapid technological
and regulatory changes occurring within the telecommunications industry. Current
and  potential  competitors  include  local  telephone  companies, interexchange
carriers, competitive access providers ("CAPs"), cable television companies  and
providers of personal communications services ("PCS").
 
    The  Communications Group  believes that  competitors will  initially target
high-volume business customers in densely  populated urban areas. The  resulting
loss  of local service customers will  affect multiple revenue streams and could
have a material, adverse  effect on the  Communications Group's operations.  The
resulting  revenue losses,  however, could be  at least partially  offset by the
Communications Group's  ability  to  bundle local,  long-distance  and  wireless
services, and provide interconnection services.
 
    The  Communications Group's strategy is  to offer integrated communications,
entertainment, information and transaction services over both wired and wireless
networks to its customers  primarily within its Region.  The key initiatives  to
support this strategy include five key elements:
 
    - Providing superior customer service
 
    - Building customer loyalty
 
    - Enhancing network capability and capacity
 
    - Expanding the product and service portfolio
 
    - Ensuring a fair competitive environment
 
    Strategic initiatives to attract and retain customers include: (1) enhancing
existing  services with products such as caller identification, call waiting and
voice messaging;  (2)  aggressive  expansion  of  data  services;  (3)  pursuing
opportunities  to offer paging, wireless and  cable television services; and (4)
rapid entry into the interLATA long-distance market.

                    MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF
           FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (CONTINUED)
 
    A market trial for a broadband network capable of providing voice, data  and
video  services to  customers commenced  in the Omaha  area in  August 1995. The
Communications Group does not intend to expand this service offering beyond  the
Omaha  area because of service cost and pricing issues. The Communications Group
does plan to  continue to provide  the system that  delivers basic, premium  and
pay-per-view  video  services in  the Omaha  area.  The Communications  Group is
evaluating the relative costs of alternative video technologies, as well as  the
near-term feasibility of interactive services. To satisfy anticipated demand for
combined   video  and  telephony   services  on  a   cost-effective  basis,  the
Communications Group's strategy  may include selective  investments in  wireless
cable technologies.
 
    The  Communications Group is subject to varying degrees of federal and state
regulation. The Communications Group's regulatory strategy includes working to:
 
    - Achieve accelerated capital recovery;
 
    - Reprice local services to cover costs and ensure these services are
      subsidy free, while lowering toll and access rates to meet competition;
      and
 
    - Ensure that the new rules associated with the Telecommunications Act of
      1996 concerning the unbundling of interconnection, resale of services and
      universal service do not advantage one competitor over another.
 
    The Communications Group is currently working with state regulators to  gain
approval of these initiatives.
 
THE MEDIA GROUP
 
    The  Media Group's  strategy is based  on the belief  that communication and
commerce are migrating  from other  mediums to electronic  networks. Over  time,
this   global  phenomenon   will  result   in  networks   replacing  traditional
distribution channels. To meet the needs of this growing market, the Media Group
provides local connections and then integrates market-based service offerings to
meet the needs  of end  users. The Media  Group executes  this strategy  through
three  lines of business -- cable and telecommunications, wireless and directory
and information services -- in selected high-growth markets worldwide.
 
    CABLE AND TELECOMMUNICATIONS   The 1996 Act will  enable the Media Group  to
provide  "one-stop shopping" for voice, video and data services, a key objective
of the Media Group. The Media Group  is currently in the process of  negotiating
reasonable   and  nondiscriminatory  local   interconnection  rates,  terms  and
conditions with BellSouth and is planning on entering the local exchange market,
through the Atlanta Systems, on a competitive basis by the end of 1996.
 
    The Atlanta Systems generally compete for viewer attention with  programming
from  a  variety  of  sources,  including  the  direct  reception  of  broadcast
television signals by the viewer's own antenna, satellite master antenna service
and direct broadcast satellite  services. Cable television  systems are also  in
competition  for  both viewers  and advertising  in  varying degrees  with other
communications and entertainment media. Such  competition may increase with  the
development and growth of new technologies.
 
    The  1996 Act has  amended certain aspects of  the Cable Television Consumer
Protection and Competition Act  of 1992 ("the 1992  Cable Act"). Under the  1996
Act,  cable  rates  are deregulated  effective  March  31, 1999,  or  earlier if
competition exists. In  addition, the provisions  of the 1996  Act simplify  the
process   of  filing  rate  complaints,  relax  uniform  rate  requirements  and
subscriber notice provisions, expand the definition of effective competition and
eliminate certain restrictions  on the  sale of cable  systems. Current  program
access  restrictions applying to cable operators are extended to common carriers
by  the  1996  Act.  The  1996  Act  also  eliminates  certain   cross-ownership
restrictions  between cable operators, broadcasters and multichannel, multipoint
distribution system operators.

           FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (CONTINUED)
 
    Cable television systems  are also  subject to  local regulation,  typically
imposed  through the franchising process. Local officials may be involved in the
initial franchise  selection,  system  design  and  construction,  safety,  rate
regulation,  customer  service standards,  billing  practices, community-related
programming and services, franchise renewal and imposition of franchise fees.
 
    In 1995,  the Georgia  legislature removed  the legal  prohibition on  local
telephone  competition by  authorizing competition  in local  telephone exchange
service. The  Media Group  has received  certification from  the Georgia  Public
Service  Commission to provide local  switched and nonswitched telephone service
in Georgia  and,  with  the  passage of  the  1996  Act,  certain  long-distance
services.
 
    WIRELESS COMMUNICATIONS  There are two competitive cellular licenses in each
market.  Competition is based on  the price of cellular  service, the quality of
the service and the size of the  geographic area served. The development of  PCS
services  will increase the number of  competitors and the level of competition.
The Media Group  is unable to  estimate the  impact of the  availability of  PCS
services on its cellular operations, though it could be significant.
 
    The  wireless operations are subject to regulation by federal and some state
and local authorities. The construction and transfer of cellular systems in  the
United  States are regulated  by the FCC  pursuant to the  Communications Act of
1934. The  FCC regulates  construction  and operation  of cellular  systems  and
licensing  and  technical  standards  for the  provision  of  cellular telephone
service. Pursuant to Congress' 1993  Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act, the  FCC
adopted  rules preempting state  and local governments  from regulating wireless
entry and most rates.
 
    The passage of the 1996 Act eliminates long-distance restrictions imposed by
the Modified Final Judgment ("MFJ"). As a result, the Media Group, including its
wireless partners,  are now  able to  offer integrated  local and  long-distance
services to its wireless customers. The 1996 Act also permits the Media Group to
enter   into  activities  related  to   the  manufacture  of  telecommunications
equipment.
 
    DIRECTORY AND  INFORMATION  SERVICES   The  Media Group  may  face  emerging
competition   in  the   provision  of   interactive  services   from  cable  and
entertainment companies,  on-line  services  and  other  information  providers.
Directory  listings are beginning to be offered via electronic databases through
telephone company and  third party networks.  As such offerings  expand and  are
enhanced   through  interactivity  and  other  features,  the  Media  Group  may
experience heightened competition in  its directory publishing businesses.  With
the  passage of the  1996 Act, the Media  Group will be  able to provide certain
information services across LATA  boundaries. The Media  Group will continue  to
expand  its core  products and develop  and package new  information products to
meet its customers' needs.
 
OTHER ISSUES
 
    The Communications Group's  interstate services have  been subject to  price
cap  regulation  since  January 1991.  Price  caps  are an  alternative  form of
regulation designed  to limit  prices rather  than profits.  However, the  FCC's
price  cap plan includes sharing of earnings  in excess of authorized levels. In
March 1995, the FCC issued an interim  order on price cap regulation. The  price
cap  index for  most services is  annually adjusted  for inflation, productivity
level and exogenous  costs, and has  resulted in reduced  access prices paid  by
interexchange  carriers  to local  telephone companies.  The interim  order also
provides for three productivity options, including a no-sharing option, and  for
increased  flexibility for adjusting prices downward in response to competition.
In 1995, the Communications Group selected the lowest productivity option, while
prior to this interim  order, the Communications Group  used an optional  higher
productivity  factor in determining its prices. Consequently, the Communications
Group expects the order to have no significant near-term impact.
 
    There are pending regulatory actions in local regulatory jurisdictions  that
call  for  price decreases,  refunds or  both.  In one  such instance,  the Utah
Supreme Court has remanded a Utah Public Service Commission ("PSC") order to the
PSC  for   reconsideration,  thereby   establishing   two  exceptions   to   the
 
                                      B-25

           FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (CONTINUED)
rule against retroactive ratemaking: 1) unforeseen and extraordinary events, and
2)   misconduct.  The  PSC's   initial  order  denied   a  refund  request  from
interexchange carriers and other parties related to the Tax Reform Act of  1986.
This  action is still  in the discovery process.  If a formal  filing -- made in
accordance with the remand from the Supreme Court -- alleges that the exceptions
apply, the range of possible risk is $0 to $150.
 
    On September 22, 1995, U S WEST  filed a lawsuit in Delaware Chancery  Court
to  enjoin the proposed merger of Time  Warner and Turner Broadcasting. U S WEST
has alleged  breaches  of  contract  and fiduciary  duties  by  Time  Warner  in
connection  with this proposed merger. Time Warner filed a countersuit against U
S WEST on October 11, 1995,  alleging misrepresentation, breach of contract  and
other  misconduct on  the part of  U S  WEST. Time Warner's  countersuit seeks a
reformation of the  Time Warner  Entertainment partnership  agreement, an  order
that  enjoins U S WEST from breaching the partnership agreement, and unspecified
compensatory damages. U S WEST  has denied each of  the claims in Time  Warner's
countersuit.  The trial for this action concluded on March 22, 1996. A ruling by
the Delaware Chancery Court is expected in June 1996.
 
    On October 2, 1995, union members approved a new three-year contract with  U
S  WEST. The contract provides  for salary increases of  10.6 percent over three
years effective January  1 of each  year. The contract  also provides  employees
with  a lump sum payment of $1,500  in lieu of wage increases becoming effective
in August of each year. This lump sum payment is being recognized over the  life
of  the  contract.  The  agreement  covers  approximately  30,000 Communications
Workers of America ("CWA") members who work for the Communications Group.
 
    On October  15, 1995,  U  S WEST  Direct and  the  CWA reached  a  tentative
agreement on their contract, subject to ratification by the CWA membership. This
contract would provide for salary increases of 10.5 percent over three years and
provides employees with a lump sum payment of $850.

                   NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
              FOR THE YEARS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 1995, 1994 AND 1993
                (DOLLARS IN MILLIONS, EXCEPT PER SHARE AMOUNTS)
 
NOTE 1: RECAPITALIZATION PLAN
    On  October  31,  1995, the  shareholders  of  U S  WEST,  Inc.,  a Colorado
corporation  ("U  S  WEST   Colorado"),  voted  to   approve  a  proposal   (the
"Recapitalization  Plan") adopted by  the Board of  Directors of U  S WEST, Inc.
(the "Board") to  reincorporate in  Delaware and  create two  classes of  common
stock   that  are  intended  to  reflect   separately  the  performance  of  the
communications and  multimedia  businesses.  Under  the  Recapitalization  Plan,
shareholders  approved an Agreement and Plan of Merger between U S WEST Colorado
and U S WEST, Inc., a Delaware  corporation ("U S WEST" or "Company"),  pursuant
to which U S WEST continues as the surviving corporation. In connection with the
merger,  the  Certificate of  Incorporation of  U  S WEST  has been  amended and
restated to designate  two classes of  common stock of  U S WEST,  one class  of
which   is  authorized   as  U   S  WEST   Communications  Group   Common  Stock
("Communications Stock"), and the  other class which is  authorized as U S  WEST
Media Group Common Stock ("Media Stock"). Effective November 1, 1995, each share
of  common stock  of U  S WEST  Colorado was  converted into  one share  each of
Communications Stock and Media Stock.
 
    The Communications  Stock  and Media  Stock  provide shareholders  with  two
distinct  securities that are intended  to reflect separately the communications
businesses  of  U  S  WEST  (the  "Communications  Group")  and  the  multimedia
businesses  of U S WEST (the "Media Group" and, together with the Communications
Group, the "Groups").
 
    The Communications Group is comprised of U S WEST Communications, Inc. ("U S
WEST Communications"), U S WEST Communications Services, Inc., U S WEST  Federal
Services,  Inc., U  S WEST  Advanced Technologies,  Inc. and  U S  WEST Business
Resources,  Inc.   The  Communications   Group  primarily   provides   regulated
communications  services  to  more  than  25  million  residential  and business
customers within a 14 state region.
 
    The Media Group is  comprised of U S  WEST Marketing Resources Group,  Inc.,
which  publishes  White and  Yellow  Pages telephone  directories,  and provides
directory and  information  services, U  S  WEST NewVector  Group,  Inc.,  which
provides  communications  and information  products  and services  over wireless
networks, U S WEST  Multimedia Communications, Inc.,  which owns domestic  cable
television  operations  and investments,  and U  S WEST  International Holdings,
Inc.,  which   primarily   owns   investments   in   international   cable   and
telecommunications, wireless communications and directory publishing operations.
 
    Dividends  to be paid on Communications Stock are initially $0.535 per share
per quarter.  Dividends  on  the  Communications  Stock  will  be  paid  at  the
discretion  of the Board, based primarily on the financial condition, results of
operations and business requirements of the Communications Group and the Company
as a whole.  With regard  to the  Media Stock,  the Board  currently intends  to
retain  future  earnings,  if any,  for  the  development of  the  Media Group's
businesses and does not  anticipate paying dividends on  the Media Stock in  the
foreseeable future.
 
NOTE 2: SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES
 
    BASIS  OF PRESENTATION   The  Consolidated Financial  Statements include the
accounts of U S WEST and its majority-owned subsidiaries, except for the capital
assets segment, which is held for sale. All significant intercompany amounts and
transactions have  been  eliminated.  Investments in  less  than  majority-owned
ventures are accounted for using the equity method.
 
    Certain  reclassifications within the Consolidated Financial Statements have
been made to conform to the current year presentation.

                                 U S WEST, INC.
             NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (CONTINUED)
 
NOTE 2: SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (CONTINUED)
    In third-quarter 1993, U  S WEST discontinued  accounting for its  regulated
telephone  operations,  U S  WEST Communications,  under Statement  of Financial
Accounting Standards ("SFAS")  No. 71,  "Accounting for the  Effects of  Certain
Types of Regulation." (See Note 8 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.)
 
    INDUSTRY  SEGMENTS  U  S WEST consists  of two Groups  -- the Communications
Group and the  Media Group. The  Communications Group operates  in one  industry
segment  (communications and related  services) and the  Media Group operates in
four  industry   segments   (directory  and   information   services,   wireless
communications,  cable and  telecommunications, and the  capital assets segment,
which is held  for sale) as  defined in  SFAS No. 14,  "Financial Reporting  for
Segments of a Business Enterprise."
 
    Prior  to January 1, 1995,  the capital assets segment  was accounted for as
discontinued operations. Effective January 1,  1995, the capital assets  segment
has been accounted for as a net investment in assets held for sale, as discussed
in Note 20 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.
 
    USE OF ESTIMATES  The preparation of financial statements in conformity with
generally  accepted accounting principles requires  management to make estimates
and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and
accompanying notes. Actual results could differ from those estimates.
 
    CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS  Cash  and cash equivalents include highly  liquid
investments  with original maturities  of three months or  less that are readily
convertible into cash and are not subject to significant risk from  fluctuations
in interest rates.
 
    INVENTORIES   AND  SUPPLIES    New  and  reusable  materials  of  U  S  WEST
Communications are carried  at average cost,  except for significant  individual
items  that are valued based on  specific costs. Nonreusable material is carried
at its estimated salvage value. Inventories  of all other U S WEST  subsidiaries
are carried at the lower of cost or market on a first-in, first-out basis.
 
    PROPERTY,  PLANT  AND  EQUIPMENT   The  investment  in  property,  plant and
equipment  is  carried  at  cost,  less  accumulated  depreciation.   Additions,
replacements  and  substantial  betterments are  capitalized.  Costs  for normal
repair and  maintenance  of  property,  plant  and  equipment  are  expensed  as
incurred.
 
    U  S WEST Communications' provision for  depreciation of property, plant and
equipment is based on various straight-line group methods using remaining useful
(economic) lives based on industry-wide studies. Prior to discontinuing SFAS No.
71,  depreciation  was  based  on  lives  specified  by  regulators.  When   the
depreciable  property, plant and equipment of U S WEST Communications is retired
or sold, the original cost  less the net salvage  value is generally charged  to
accumulated depreciation.
 
    The  other  subsidiaries of  U  S WEST  provide  for depreciation  using the
straight-line method. When  such depreciable  property, plant  and equipment  is
retired or sold, the resulting gain or loss is included in income.
 
    Depreciation  expense was $2,215, $2,029 and  $1,941 in 1995, 1994 and 1993,
respectively.
 
    Interest related to qualifying construction projects, including construction
projects of equity method investees, is capitalized and reflected as a reduction
of interest expense. At U S WEST Communications, prior to discontinuing SFAS No.
71, capitalized interest  was included as  an element of  other income.  Amounts
capitalized  by  U  S  WEST were  $72,  $44  and  $20 in  1995,  1994  and 1993,
respectively.
 
    INTANGIBLE ASSETS  Intangible assets are recorded when the cost of  acquired
companies  exceeds  the  fair  value  of their  tangible  assets.  The  costs of
identified   intangible   assets   and    goodwill   are   amortized   by    the
 
                                      B-34

NOTE 2: SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (CONTINUED)
straight-line method over periods ranging from five to forty years. These assets
are evaluated, with other related assets, for impairment using a discounted cash
flow  methodology. Amortization expense was  $76, $23 and $14  in 1995, 1994 and
1993, respectively.
 
    FOREIGN CURRENCY  TRANSLATION    Assets  and  liabilities  of  international
investments  are  translated at  year-end exchange  rates, and  income statement
items  are  translated  at  average  exchange  rates  for  the  year.  Resulting
translation  adjustments are recorded  as a separate  component of equity. Gains
and losses resulting from foreign currency transactions are included in income.
 
    REVENUE RECOGNITION   Local  telephone service,  cellular access  and  cable
television  revenues are generally billed monthly,  in advance, and revenues are
recognized the following month when services are provided. Revenues derived from
other telephone services, including exchange access, long-distance and  cellular
airtime usage, are billed and recorded monthly as services are provided.
 
    Directory  advertising  revenues  and related  directory  costs  of selling,
composition, printing  and distribution  are generally  deferred and  recognized
over  the  period during  which directories  are used,  normally 12  months. For
international operations, directory advertising  revenues and related  directory
costs  are deferred  and recognized  upon publication.  The balance  of deferred
directory costs included in prepaid and other  is $247 and $234 at December  31,
1995 and 1994, respectively.
 
    FINANCIAL  INSTRUMENTS  Net interest received or paid on interest rate swaps
is recognized over the life of the  swaps as an adjustment to interest  expense.
Foreign  exchange  contracts  designated  as hedges  of  firm  equity investment
commitments are  carried at  market value,  with gains  and losses  recorded  in
equity  until sale of the investment.  Forward contracts designated as hedges of
foreign denominated loans are  recorded at market value,  with gains and  losses
recorded in income.
 
    INVESTMENTS  IN DEBT SECURITIES  Debt securities are classified as available
for sale and are carried at fair  market value with unrealized gains and  losses
included in equity.
 
    COMPUTER  SOFTWARE   The  cost of  computer  software, whether  purchased or
developed internally,  is  charged  to  expense  with  two  exceptions.  Initial
operating  systems software  is capitalized and  amortized over the  life of the
related hardware, and initial network  applications software is capitalized  and
amortized  over  three years.  Subsequent upgrades  to capitalized  software are
expensed. Capitalized computer software  of $190 and $146  at December 31,  1995
and  1994,  respectively,  is recorded  in  property, plant  and  equipment. The
Company amortized capitalized  computer software costs  of $70, $62  and $37  in
1995, 1994 and 1993, respectively.
 
    INCOME TAXES  The provision for income taxes consists of an amount for taxes
currently  payable and an amount for tax consequences deferred to future periods
in accordance with SFAS No. 109. U S WEST implemented SFAS No. 109,  "Accounting
for Income Taxes," in 1993. Adoption of the new standard did not have a material
effect  on the financial position or results of operations, primarily because of
the Company's earlier adoption of SFAS No. 96.
 
    For financial  statement  purposes,  investment  tax credits  of  U  S  WEST
Communications  are  being  amortized over  the  economic lives  of  the related
property, plant  and  equipment  in  accordance  with  the  deferred  method  of
accounting for such credits.
 
    EARNINGS  (LOSS) PER COMMON SHARE   For 1995, earnings  per common share for
Communications Stock  and Media  Stock are  presented on  a pro  forma basis  to
reflect  the two classes of stock as  if they had been outstanding since January
1, 1995. For periods  prior to the recapitalization,  the average common  shares
outstanding are assumed to be equal to the average common shares outstanding for
U  S WEST. For 1994  and 1993, earnings (loss) per  common share are computed on
the basis of  the weighted average  number of shares  of U S  WEST common  stock
outstanding during each year.

             NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (CONTINUED)
 
NOTE 2: SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (CONTINUED)
    NEW  ACCOUNTING  STANDARDS   In  1996, U  S WEST  will  adopt SFAS  No. 121,
"Accounting for the Impairment of Long-Lived Assets and for Long-Lived Assets to
be Disposed Of."  SFAS No. 121  requires that long-lived  assets and  associated
intangibles  be  written  down  to  fair  value  whenever  an  impairment review
indicates that the carrying  value cannot be recovered  on an undiscounted  cash
flow  basis.  SFAS  No.  121  also requires  that  a  company  no  longer record
depreciation expense on assets held for sale. U S WEST expects that the adoption
of SFAS No. 121  will not have  a material effect on  its financial position  or
results of operations.
 
    In  1996, U  S WEST  will adopt  SFAS No.  123, "Accounting  for Stock-Based
Compensation." This standard establishes a fair value method for accounting  for
stock-based  compensation plans  either through  recognition or  disclosure. U S
WEST  will  adopt   this  standard  through   compliance  with  the   disclosure
requirements  set forth in SFAS  No. 123. Adoption of  the standard will have no
impact on the financial position or results of operations of U S WEST.
 
NOTE 3: INDUSTRY SEGMENTS
    Industry segment data is  presented for the consolidated  operations of U  S
WEST.  The Company's equity  method investments and  the capital assets segment,
which is held for sale, are included in "Corporate and other."
 
    The businesses  comprising  the Communications  Group  operate in  a  single
industry  segment  -- communications  and  related services.  The Communications
Group primarily  provides  regulated communications  services  to more  than  25
million  residential and business  customers in the  Communications Group region
(the "Region").  The Region  includes the  states of  Arizona, Colorado,  Idaho,
Iowa,  Minnesota,  Montana, Nebraska,  New Mexico,  North Dakota,  Oregon, South
Dakota, Utah, Washington  and Wyoming.  Services offered  by the  Communications
Group  include local telephone services, exchange access services (which connect
customers to the facilities of  carriers, including long-distance providers  and
wireless   operators),  and  long-distance  services  within  Local  Access  and
Transport Areas ("LATAs") in the Region. The Communications Group provides other
products  and  services,  including  custom  calling,  voice  messaging,  caller
identification,  high-speed data  applications, customer  premises equipment and
certain communications services to business customers and governmental  agencies
both inside and outside the Region.
 
    Approximately  97 percent  of the revenues  of the  Communications Group are
attributable  to  the  operations   of  U  S   WEST  Communications,  of   which
approximately  59  percent are  derived from  the  states of  Arizona, Colorado,
Minnesota and Washington.
 
    The Media Group operates  in four industry  segments, including the  capital
assets  segment, which is held for  sale. The directory and information services
segment  consists  of  the  publishing  of  White  and  Yellow  Pages  telephone
directories,  database marketing  services and interactive  services in domestic
and  international  markets.  The   wireless  communications  segment   provides
information  products  and services  over wireless  networks  in 13  western and
midwestern states. The cable and telecommunications segment was created with the

(1)
  Includes  revenue from directory publishing activities  in Europe of $122, $78
  and $7, and identifiable assets of $133, $124 and $4 for 1995, 1994 and  1993,
  respectively.
 
(2)
  Results  of operations have been included since the date of acquisition of the
  Atlanta Systems.
 
(3)
  Includes U S WEST's equity method investments and the capital assets  segment,
  which has been discontinued and is held for sale.
 
(4)
  Includes   pretax  restructuring  charges  of  $880,   $50  and  $70  for  the
  communications and related  services, directory and  information services  and
  wireless communications segments, respectively.
 
    Operating   income  represents  sales  and  other  revenues  less  operating
expenses,  and  excludes  interest  expense,  equity  losses  in  unconsolidated
ventures, other income (expense) and income taxes. Identifiable assets are those
assets  used in  each segment's operations.  Corporate and  other assets consist
primarily of cash, debt securities,  investments in international ventures,  the
investment  in Time Warner Entertainment, the  net investment in assets held for
sale and  other assets.  Corporate and  other operating  losses include  general
corporate  expenses and administrative costs primarily associated with the Media
Group equity investments.
 
    SIGNIFICANT CONCENTRATIONS  The largest volume of the Communications Group's
services are provided to AT&T. During  1995, 1994 and 1993, revenues related  to
those  services provided to  AT&T were $1,085,  $1,130 and $1,159, respectively.
Related accounts receivable at December 31, 1995 and 1994, totaled $91 and  $98,
respectively.  As of December 31, 1995, the Communications Group is not aware of
any other significant  concentration of  business transacted  with a  particular
customer, supplier or lender that could, if suddenly eliminated, severely impact
operations.
 
    To  ensure consistency  and quality  of service,  the wireless  segment uses
Motorola as its primary vendor for infrastructure equipment and cellular  mobile
telephone  equipment  and accessories.  In  addition, Motorola  provides ongoing
technological support for  the infrastructure equipment.  The infrastructure  of
approximately  75  percent  of  the  Media  Group's  major  cellular  markets is
comprised of Motorola equipment.
 
    WIRELESS COMMUNICATIONS SEGMENT  During 1994,  U S WEST signed a  definitive
agreement  with  AirTouch  Communications  to  combine  their  domestic cellular
assets. The initial  equity ownership  of this  cellular joint  venture will  be
approximately  70  percent  AirTouch  and approximately  30  percent  U  S WEST.

NOTE 3: INDUSTRY SEGMENTS (CONTINUED)
The combination will take place  in two phases. During Phase  I, which U S  WEST
entered  effective  November  1, 1995,  the  two companies  are  operating their
cellular properties separately.  A Wireless Management  Company (the "WMC")  has
been  formed  and  is providing  centralized  services  to both  companies  on a
contract basis.  In  Phase II,  AirTouch  and U  S  WEST will  contribute  their
domestic cellular assets to the WMC. In this phase, the Company will reflect its
share  of the combined operating  results of the WMC  using the equity method of
accounting. The recent passage of the Telecommunications Act of 1996 has removed
significant regulatory  barriers  to completion  of  Phase II  of  the  business
combination.  U S WEST expects that Phase II closing could take place by the end
of 1996 or early 1997.
 
NOTE 4: ACQUISITION OF CABLE SYSTEMS
 
    ATLANTA SYSTEMS  On December 6, 1994, U S WEST acquired the stock of Wometco
Cable Corp.  and subsidiaries,  and the  assets of  Georgia Cable  Partners  and
Atlanta  Cable  Partners L.P.  (the  "Atlanta Systems"),  for  cash of  $745 and
12,779,206 U S WEST common shares valued at $459, for a total purchase price  of
approximately $1.2 billion. The Atlanta Systems' results of operations have been
included in the consolidated results of operations of the Company since the date
of  acquisition.  Had  the  acquisition  occurred as  of  January  1,  1994, the
Company's revenue, net income and earnings per common share for 1994 would  have
been $11,143, $1,415 and $3.04, respectively.
 
    The  acquisition was accounted  for using the  purchase method. Accordingly,
the purchase  price  was  allocated to  assets  acquired  (primarily  identified
intangibles)  based on their  estimated fair values.  The identified intangibles
and goodwill are being amortized on a straight-line basis over 25 years.
 
    CONTINENTAL CABLEVISION, INC. (SUBSEQUENT EVENT)  On February 27, 1996,  the
Company  announced a definitive agreement to merge with Continental Cablevision,
Inc. ("Continental"). Continental,  the nation's  third-largest cable  operator,
serves  4.2 million domestic customers, passes  more than seven million domestic
homes and holds  significant other  domestic and international  properties. U  S
WEST will purchase all of Continental's stock for approximately $5.3 billion and
will   assume  Continental's  debt  and   other  obligations,  which  amount  to
approximately $5.5 billion. Consideration  for the $5.3  billion in equity  will
consist  of approximately $1 billion in U S WEST preferred stock, convertible to
Media Stock; and, at U S WEST's  option, between $1 billion and $1.5 billion  in
cash,  and  $2.8  billion  to  $3.3  billion  in  shares  of  Media  Stock.  The
transaction, which  is expected  to close  in  the fourth  quarter of  1996,  is
subject  to  a  number of  conditions  and approvals,  including  approvals from
Continental shareholders and local franchising and government authorities.
 
NOTE 5: INVESTMENT IN TIME WARNER ENTERTAINMENT
 
    On September 15,  1993, U S  WEST acquired 25.51  percent pro-rata  priority
capital  and  residual  equity  interests ("equity  interests")  in  Time Warner
Entertainment Company  L.P.  ("TWE"  or  "Time  Warner  Entertainment")  for  an
aggregate  purchase price of $2.553 billion. TWE owns and operates substantially
all of the  entertainment assets  previously owned  by Time  Warner Inc.  ("Time
Warner"),  consisting primarily of its filmed entertainment, programming-HBO and
cable businesses.
 
    Upon  U  S  WEST's  admission  to  the  partnership,  certain  wholly  owned
subsidiaries  of Time  Warner ("General  Partners") and  subsidiaries of Toshiba
Corporation and ITOCHU Corporation held  pro-rata priority capital and  residual
equity  interests of 63.27,  5.61 and 5.61 percent,  respectively. In 1995, Time
Warner  acquired   the  limited   partnership  interests   previously  held   by
subsidiaries of each of ITOCHU Corporation and Toshiba Corporation.
 
    U  S  WEST has  an  option to  increase  its pro-rata  priority  capital and
residual equity  interests  in  TWE  from 25.51  percent  up  to  31.84  percent
depending upon cable operating performance. The option is

exercisable, in whole or part, between January 1, 1999, and May 31, 2005, for an
aggregate  cash  exercise  price ranging  from  $1.25 billion  to  $1.8 billion,
depending upon the year of exercise. Either TWE  or U S WEST may elect that  the
exercise  price for  the option be  paid with partnership  interests rather than
cash.
 
    Pursuant to the TWE Partnership Agreement, there are four levels of capital.
From the most to least senior, the capital accounts are: senior preferred  (held
by  the General  Partners); pro-rata priority  capital (A preferred  -- held pro
rata by the general and limited partners); junior priority capital (B  preferred
- -- held by the General Partners); and common (residual equity interests held pro
rata  by the general and limited partners). Of the $2.553 billion contributed by
U S WEST,  $1.658 billion  represents A  preferred capital  and $895  represents
common  capital. The TWE Partnership  Agreement provides for special allocations
of income and distributions of  partnership capital. Partnership income, to  the
extent earned, is allocated as follows: (1) to the partners so that the economic
burden  of the  income tax  consequences of  partnership operations  is borne as
though the partnership was taxed  as a corporation ("special tax  allocations");
(2)  to the partners' preferred capital  accounts in order of priority described
above, at various rates of return ranging  from 8 percent to 13.25 percent;  and
(3)  to the  partners' common  capital according  to their  residual partnership
interests. To  the extent  partnership  income is  insufficient to  satisfy  all
special  allocations in a particular accounting  period, the unearned portion is
carried over  until  satisfied out  of  future partnership  income.  Partnership
losses  generally  are  allocated in  reverse  order, first  to  eliminate prior
allocations of  partnership  income, except  senior  preferred and  special  tax
income,  next to  reduce initial capital  amounts, other  than senior preferred,
then to reduce the  senior preferred account and  finally, to eliminate  special
tax allocations.
 
    A  summary of the  contributed capital and priority  capital rates of return
follows:

    Cash distributions are required to be made to the partners to permit them to
pay income taxes at statutory rates based on their allocable taxable income from
TWE  ("Tax Distributions").  The aggregate amount  of such  Tax Distributions is
computed generally by reference to the  taxes that TWE would have been  required
to  pay if it were  a corporation. Tax Distributions  were previously subject to
restrictions until July  1995, and are  now paid  to the partners  on a  current
basis.  For  distributions  other than  those  related  to taxes  or  the senior
preferred, the  TWE Partnership  Agreement  requires certain  cash  distribution
thresholds  be met to  the limited partners before  the General Partners receive
their full share of distributions. No cash  distributions have been made to U  S
WEST.

             NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (CONTINUED)
 
NOTE 5: INVESTMENT IN TIME WARNER ENTERTAINMENT (CONTINUED)
    U  S WEST  accounts for  its investment  in TWE  under the  equity method of
accounting. The  excess  of fair  market  value over  the  book value  of  total
partnership  net  assets  implied by  U  S  WEST's initial  investment  was $5.7
billion. This excess is being amortized on a straight-line basis over 25  years.
The  Company's recorded share of TWE  operating results represents allocated TWE
net income or loss adjusted  for the amortization of  the excess of fair  market
value  over the book  value of the partnership  net assets. As  a result of this
amortization and the special income  allocations described above, the  Company's
recorded  pretax share  of TWE operating  results before  extraordinary item was
$(31), $(18) and $(20)  in 1995, 1994 and  1993, respectively. In addition,  TWE
recorded an extraordinary loss for the early extinguishment of debt in 1995. The
Company's  share of this extraordinary loss was $4, net of an income tax benefit
of $2.
 
    As consideration for its expertise and participation in the cable operations
of TWE, the Company  earns a management  fee of $130 over  five years, which  is
payable  over a four-year period beginning in  1995. Management fees of $26, $26
and $8  were recorded  to other  income in  1995, 1994  and 1993,  respectively.
Included  in the U S WEST Consolidated Balance Sheet is a note payable to TWE of
$169 and $771 and management fee receivables of $50 and $34 at December 31, 1995
and 1994, respectively.

NOTE 5: INVESTMENT IN TIME WARNER ENTERTAINMENT (CONTINUED)
    In early 1995, Time Warner announced its intention to simplify its corporate
structure by establishing an enterprise that will be responsible for the overall
management and financing  of the  cable and  telecommunications properties.  Any
change  in the structure of TWE would require U S WEST's approval in addition to
certain creditors' and regulatory  approvals. (See Note  19 to the  Consolidated
Financial Statements for disclosure related to litigation with Time Warner.)
 
NOTE 6: RESTRUCTURING CHARGE
    The  Company's  1993  results  reflect  a  $1  billion  restructuring charge
(pretax). The related restructuring plan (the "Restructuring Plan") is  designed
to  provide faster, more responsive customer  services, while reducing the costs
of providing these services. As part  of the Restructuring Plan, the Company  is
developing  new systems and enhanced system functionality that will enable it to
monitor networks to reduce the risk of service interruptions, activate telephone
service on demand, rapidly  design and engineer new  services for customers  and
centralize  its service centers.  The Company has  consolidated its 560 customer
service centers into 26 centers in 10  cities and reducing its total work  force
by  approximately  10,000  employees.  This  increased  the  number  of employee
separations to 10,000  from 9,000, and  increased the estimated  total cost  for
employee  separations  to $316,  compared with  $286  in the  original estimate.
Approximately 1,000 employees  that were  originally expected  to relocate  have
chosen  separation or other job assignments and have been replaced. The $30 cost
associated with  these additional  employee  separations was  reclassified  from
relocation to the reserve for employee separations during 1995.
 
    Following  is a  schedule of  the costs  included in  the 1993 restructuring
charge:

service  centers and retraining employees on the methods and systems required in
the new, restructured mode of operation.

    The Restructuring Plan is expected to be substantially completed by the  end
of 1997. Implementation of the Restructuring Plan has been impacted by growth in
the  business and related service  issues, new business opportunities, revisions
to system  delivery  schedules  and  productivity issues  caused  by  the  major
rearrangement  of resources due to restructuring.  These issues will continue to
affect the timing of employee separations.

    In  November 1994, TeleWest plc ("TeleWest") made an initial public offering
of its ordinary shares. Following the offering,  in which U S WEST sold part  of
its 50 percent joint venture interest, U S WEST owned approximately 37.8 percent
of TeleWest. Net proceeds of approximately $650 were used by TeleWest to finance
construction and operating costs, invest in affiliated companies and repay debt.
It  is U S WEST's policy  to recognize as income any  gains or losses related to
the sale of stock to the public. The Company recognized a gain of $105 in  1994,
net of $59 in deferred taxes, for the partial sale of its joint venture interest
in TeleWest.
 
    On  October 2, 1995, TeleWest and SBC  CableComms (UK) completed a merger of
their UK cable television and telecommunications interests, creating the largest
provider of  combined  cable  and  telecommunications  services  in  the  United
Kingdom.  Following completion of the merger,  U S WEST and Tele-Communications,
Inc., the major shareholders, each own 26.8 percent of the combined company. The
Company recognized a gain of $95 in  1995, net of $62 in deferred income  taxes,
in conjunction with the merger.
 
    TeleWest,  which is  the only  equity method  investment for  which a quoted
market price is available, had a market value of $914 at December 31, 1995,  and
$1,004 at December 31, 1994.

    In 1995, U S WEST Communications sold certain rural telephone exchanges with
a cost basis  of $258. U  S WEST Communications  received consideration for  the
sales  of $388, including  $214 in cash.  In 1994, U  S WEST Communications sold
certain rural  telephone  exchanges with  a  cost  basis of  $122  and  received
consideration of $204, including $93 in cash.
 
    The  Media Group  businesses depreciate  buildings between  15 to  35 years,
cellular and  cable distribution  systems between  5 to  15 years,  and  general
purpose  computers and other between 3 to  20 years. See "Discontinuance of SFAS
No. 71" for depreciation rates used by the Communications Group.
 
DISCONTINUANCE OF SFAS NO. 71
 
    U S WEST  Communications incurred  a noncash, extraordinary  charge of  $3.1
billion,  net of an income tax benefit  of $2.3 billion, in conjunction with its
decision to discontinue accounting for the operations of U S WEST Communications
in accordance with SFAS No. 71, "Accounting for the Effects of Certain Types  of
Regulation,"  as  of  September  30,  1993. SFAS  No.  71  generally  applies to
regulated companies that meet certain requirements, including a requirement that
a company be able to recover its costs, notwithstanding competition, by charging
its customers at prices established by its regulators. U S WEST  Communications'
decision  to discontinue application of SFAS No. 71 was based on the belief that
competition, market  conditions and  technological  advances, more  than  prices
established  by regulators, will determine the future  cost recovery by U S WEST
Communications. As a result  of this change,  the remaining asset  lives of U  S
WEST  Communications' plant  were shortened to  more closely  reflect the useful
(economic) lives of such plant.
 
    Following is a list of the major categories of telephone property, plant and
equipment and  the  manner in  which  depreciable  lives were  affected  by  the
discontinuance of SFAS No. 71:

    U  S WEST Communications employed two methods to determine the amount of the
extraordinary charge. The "economic life" method  assumed that a portion of  the
plant-related   effect  is   a  regulatory  asset   that  was   created  by  the
under-depreciation  of  plant   under  regulation.  This   method  yielded   the
plant-related  adjustment that was confirmed by  the second method, a discounted
cash flows analysis.

    The weighted average interest rate on commercial paper was 5.79 percent  and
5.97 percent at December 31, 1995 and 1994, respectively.
 
    The bank loan, in the translated principal amount of $216, is denominated in
Dutch  guilders.  The  loan was  entered  into  in connection  with  U  S WEST's
investment in a cable  television venture in the  Netherlands and was repaid  in
February 1996.
 
    U  S WEST  maintains a commercial  paper program to  finance short-term cash
flow requirements, as  well as  to maintain a  presence in  the short-term  debt
market.  U S WEST is permitted to  borrow up to approximately $1.9 billion under
lines of credit, all of which was available at December 31, 1995.

    Long-term debt consists principally  of debentures, medium-term notes,  debt
associated   with  the  Company's  Leveraged   Employee  Stock  Ownership  Plans
("LESOP"), and zero coupon subordinated notes convertible at any time into equal
shares of Communications  Stock and Media  Stock. The zero  coupon notes have  a
yield  to  maturity of  approximately  7.3 percent.  The  zero coupon  notes are
recorded at a discounted value of $521  and $498 at December 31, 1995 and  1994,
respectively.
 
    In  1995,  U  S WEST  issued  $130  of Debt  Exchangeable  for  Common Stock
("DECS"), due December 15, 1998, in the principal amount of $24.00 per note. The
notes bear interest at 7.625 percent,  of which 1.775 percent has been  included
in  the  assets  held  for  sale  reserve.  Upon  maturity,  each  DECS  will be
mandatorily redeemed by U S WEST for shares of Enhance Financial Services Group,
Inc. ("Enhance") held by U S WEST or the cash equivalent, at U S WEST's  option.
The  number of shares to be delivered at  maturity varies based on the per share
market price of Enhance. If  the market price is $24.00  per share or less,  one
share of Enhance will be delivered for each note; if the market price is between
$24.00 and $28.32 per share, a fractional share equal to $24.00 is delivered; if
the  market value is greater than $28.32  per share, .8475 shares are delivered.
The capital  assets segment  currently owns  approximately 31.5  percent of  the
outstanding Enhance common stock.
 
    During  1995, U S WEST  refinanced $2.6 billion of  commercial paper to take
advantage of favorable long-term interest  rates. In addition to the  commercial
paper,  U S WEST refinanced $145 of long-term debt. Expenses associated with the
refinancing of long-term debt resulted in extraordinary charges to income of $8,
net of an income tax benefit of $5.
 
    During 1993,  U S  WEST refinanced  long-term debt  issues aggregating  $2.7
billion  in principal amount. Expenses  associated with the refinancing resulted
in an extraordinary charge to income of $77, net of a tax benefit of $48.
 
    At December 31, 1995, U  S WEST guaranteed debt  in the principal amount  of
approximately $140, primarily related to international ventures.

NOTE 10: DEBT (CONTINUED)
    Interest  payments, net of amounts capitalized,  were $518, $523 and $670 in
1995, 1994 and 1993,  respectively, of which $87,  $134 and $272,  respectively,
relate to the capital assets segment.
 
INTEREST RATE RISK MANAGEMENT
 
    Interest  rate  swap agreements  are primarily  used to  effectively convert
existing commercial paper to  fixed-rate debt. This allows  U S WEST to  achieve
interest savings over issuing fixed-rate debt directly.
 
    Under  an interest rate swap, U S WEST agrees with another party to exchange
interest payments at specified intervals over a defined term. Interest  payments
are  calculated by  reference to  the notional  amount based  on the  fixed- and
variable-rate terms of the swap agreements. The net interest received or paid as
part of the interest  rate swap is  accounted for as  an adjustment to  interest
expense.
 
    During 1995 and 1994, U S WEST Communications entered into currency swaps to
convert  Swiss franc-denominated debt to dollar-denominated debt. This allowed U
S WEST  Communications  to achieve  interest  savings over  issuing  fixed-rate,
dollar-denominated  debt.  The  currency  swap  and  foreign  currency  debt are
combined and accounted for as if fixed-rate, dollar-denominated debt were issued
directly.
 
    The following table summarizes terms of swaps. Variable rates are indexed to
two- and ten-year constant maturity Treasury and 30-day commercial paper rates.

</TABLE>
 
    In 1993, U  S WEST Communications  executed forward contracts  to sell  U.S.
Treasury  bonds to lock in  the U.S. Treasury rate  component of the future debt
issue. At December 31, 1995, deferred credits of $8 and deferred charges of  $51
on  closed forward contracts are  included as part of  the carrying value of the
underlying debt. The  deferred credits  and charges  are being  recognized as  a
yield  adjustment over  the life  of the  debt, which  matures at  various dates
through 2043. The  net deferred charge  is directly offset  by the lower  coupon
rate  achieved on the  debt issuance. At  December 31, 1995,  there were no open
forward contracts.
 
    The counterparties  to these  interest rate  contracts are  major  financial
institutions.  U S WEST is exposed to credit loss in the event of nonperformance
by these counterparties. U S WEST manages this exposure by monitoring the credit
standing of the counterparty and establishing dollar and term limitations  which
correspond  to the respective credit rating of  each counterparty. U S WEST does
not have  significant  exposure  to  an individual  counterparty  and  does  not
anticipate nonperformance by any counterparty.
 
NOTE 11: FAIR VALUES OF FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS
    Fair  values  of  cash  equivalents, other  current  amounts  receivable and
payable, and short-term debt approximate carrying values due to their short-term
nature.
 
    The fair  values of  mandatorily redeemable  preferred stock  and  long-term
receivables,  based on discounting  future cash flows,  approximate the carrying
values. The fair value of foreign exchange contracts, based on estimated amounts
U S WEST  would receive  or pay to  terminate such  agreements, approximate  the
carrying  values. It is not practicable to  estimate the fair value of financial
guarantees associated with international operations because there are no  quoted
market prices for similar transactions.

NOTE 13: PREFERRED STOCK
    U  S WEST has  200,000,000 authorized shares  of preferred stock, 10,000,000
shares of  which are  designated  as Series  A Junior  Participating  Cumulative
Preferred  Stock,  par value  $1.00 per  share, 10,000,000  shares of  which are
designated as  Series B  Junior Participating  Cumulative Preferred  Stock,  par
value  $1.00 per share,  and 50,000 shares  of which are  designated as Series C
Preferred Stock, par value $1.00 per share.
 
PREFERRED STOCK SUBJECT TO MANDATORY REDEMPTION
 
    On September  2,  1994, the  Company  issued to  Fund  American  Enterprises
Holdings  Inc. ("FFC") 50,000 shares of 7 percent Series C Cumulative Redeemable
Preferred Stock for a total of $50.  (See Note 20 to the Consolidated  Financial
Statements.)  Upon issuance,  the preferred  stock was  recorded at  fair market
value of $51. U S  WEST has the right, commencing  five years from September  2,
1994,  to  redeem the  shares for  one  thousand dollars  per share  plus unpaid
dividends and a  redemption premium.  The shares are  mandatorily redeemable  in
year  ten  at  face value  plus  unpaid dividends.  At  the option  of  FFC, the
preferred stock also  can be redeemed  for common shares  of Financial  Security
Assurance, an investment held by the capital assets segment. The market value of
the  option was $20 and  $22 (based on the  Black-Scholes Model) at December 31,
1995 and 1994, with no carrying value.
 
NOTE 14: COMPANY-OBLIGATED MANDATORILY REDEEMABLE PREFERRED SECURITIES OF
         SUBSIDIARY TRUST HOLDING SOLELY COMPANY-GUARANTEED DEBENTURES
    On September 11, 1995, U S WEST Financing I, a wholly owned subsidiary of  U
S  WEST ("Financing  I"), issued $600  million of 7.96  percent Trust Originated
Preferred Securities (the "Preferred Securities") and $19 of common  securities.
U  S  WEST  holds all  of  the  outstanding common  securities  of  Financing I.
Financing I used  the proceeds  from such  issuance to  purchase from  U S  WEST
Capital  Funding,  Inc.,  a  wholly  owned  subsidiary  of  U  S  WEST ("Capital
Funding"), $619 principal amount of Capital Funding's 7.96 percent  Subordinated
Deferrable  Interest Notes  due 2025  (the "Subordinated  Debt Securities"), the
obligations under which  are fully and  unconditionally guaranteed by  U S  WEST
(the  "Debt Guarantee").  The sole  assets of  Financing I  are and  will be the
Subordinated Debt Securities and the Debt Guarantee.
 
    In addition, U S WEST has guaranteed the payment of interest and  redemption
amounts  to holders of Preferred Securities when Financing I has funds available
for such  payments  (the  "Payment  Guarantee") as  well  as  Capital  Funding's
undertaking  to pay all  of Financing I's costs,  expenses and other obligations
(the "Expense Undertaking"). The Payment Guarantee and the Expense  Undertaking,
including  U S WEST's  guarantee with respect  thereto, considered together with
Capital  Funding's  obligations  under  the  indenture  and  Subordinated   Debt
Securities  and U S WEST's obligations under the indenture, declaration and Debt
Guarantee, constitute  a  full  and  unconditional guarantee  by  U  S  WEST  of
Financing I's obligations under the Preferred Securities. The interest and other
payment dates on the Subordinated Debt Securities correspond to the distribution
and   other   payment  dates   on  the   Preferred  Securities.   Under  certain
circumstances, the  Subordinated  Debt  Securities may  be  distributed  to  the
holders  of  Preferred  Securities  and  common  securities  in  liquidation  of
Financing I. The Subordinated Debt Securities are redeemable in whole or in part
by Capital Funding at any time on  or after September 11, 2000, at a  redemption
price of $25.00 per Subordinated Debt Security plus accrued and unpaid interest.
If  Capital Funding  redeems the  Subordinated Debt  Securities, Financing  I is
required to redeem  the Preferred  Securities concurrently at  $25.00 per  share
plus  accrued  and unpaid  distributions. As  of  December 31,  1995, 24,000,000
Preferred Securities were outstanding.

  Under the Recapitalization Plan, Media Stock was not issued to shareowners who
  elected  to receive  cash rather  than Communications  Stock and  Media Stock.
  Dissenting shareowners were paid $47.9375 per  U S WEST share on December  15,
  1995.
 
     COMMON  STOCK  On  December 6, 1994,  12,779,206 shares of  U S WEST common
stock were issued to, or in the name  of, the holders of Wometco Cable Corp.  in
accordance  with a merger  agreement. (See Note 4  to the Consolidated Financial
Statements.)  In  connection  with  the  settlement  of  shareowner   litigation
("Rosenbaum  v. U S  WEST, Inc. et  al."), the Company  issued approximately 5.5
million shares of U S WEST common stock in March 1994 to class members connected
with  this  litigation.   U  S   WEST  issued,  to   certified  class   members,
nontransferable  rights to  purchase shares  of common  stock directly  from U S
WEST, on a commission-free basis,  at a 3 percent  discount from the average  of
the  high and low trading prices of such stock on the New York Stock Exchange on
February  23,  1994,  the  pricing  date  designated  in  accordance  with   the
settlement. U S WEST received net proceeds of $210 from the offering.

NOTE 15: SHAREOWNERS' EQUITY (CONTINUED)
    During  fourth-quarter 1993, the Company issued 22 million additional shares
of U S WEST common stock for net  cash proceeds of $1,020. The Company used  the
net  proceeds to reduce short-term indebtedness, including indebtedness incurred
from the TWE investment, and for general corporate purposes.
 
    LEVERAGED EMPLOYEE STOCK  OWNERSHIP PLAN  ("LESOP")   U S  WEST maintains  a
defined   contribution  savings  plan  for   substantially  all  management  and
occupational employees of the Company. The Company matches a certain  percentage
of  eligible employee contributions with shares  of Communications Stock and/ or
Media Stock  in accordance  with participant  elections. Participants  may  also
elect  to reallocate past Company contributions between Communications Stock and
Media Stock. In 1989, U S WEST  established two LESOPs to provide Company  stock
for matching contributions to the savings plan. At December 31, 1995, 10,145,485
shares  each of Communications Stock and Media Stock has been allocated from the
LESOP, while  2,839,435 shares  each  of Communications  Stock and  Media  Stock
remained unallocated.
 
    The   borrowings  associated  with  the  LESOP,  which  are  unconditionally
guaranteed by U S  WEST, are included in  the accompanying Consolidated  Balance
Sheets  and corresponding  amounts have  been recorded  as reductions  to common
shareowners' equity.  Contributions from  the Company  as well  as dividends  on
unallocated  shares held by the  LESOP ($8, $11 and $14  in 1995, 1994 and 1993,
respectively) are used  for debt service.  Beginning with the  dividend paid  in
fourth-quarter  1995, dividends on  allocated shares are  being paid annually to
participants. Previously,  dividends  on allocated  shares  were used  for  debt
service with participants receiving additional shares from the LESOP.
 
    U S WEST recognizes expense based on the cash payments method. Total Company
contributions  to the plan (excluding dividends) were  $86, $80 and $75 in 1995,
1994 and 1993, respectively, of which $15, $19 and $24, respectively, have  been
classified as interest expense.
 
    SHAREHOLDER  RIGHTS PLAN   The Board  has adopted a  shareholder rights plan
which, in the event of a takeover attempt, would entitle existing shareowners to
certain preferential  rights.  The rights  expire  on  April 6,  1999,  and  are
redeemable  by  the Company  at any  time prior  to the  date they  would become
effective.
 
    SHARE REPURCHASE  Subsequent to the acquisition of the Atlanta Systems  (See
Note  4  to the  Consolidated Financial  Statements)  the Company  announced its
intention to purchase U S WEST common shares in the open market up to an  amount
equal  to those  issued in conjunction  with the acquisition,  subject to market
conditions. In first-quarter 1995, the Company purchased 1,704,700 shares of U S
WEST common stock at an average price per share of $37.02. In December 1994, the
Company purchased 550,400 shares of  U S WEST common  stock at an average  price
per share of $36.30.
 
NOTE 16: STOCK INCENTIVE PLANS
    U  S WEST maintains stock incentive  plans for executives and key employees,
and nonemployees.  The Amended  1994 Stock  Plan (the  "Plan") was  approved  by
shareowners  on October 31,  1995 in connection  with the Recapitalization Plan.
The Plan is a successor plan to the U S WEST, Inc. Stock Incentive Plan and  the
U  S WEST 1991 Stock Incentive Plan (the "Predecessor Plans"). No further grants
of options or restricted stock may be made under the Predecessor Plans. The Plan
is administered by the Human Resources Committee of the board of directors  with
respect  to officers, executive officers and  outside directors and by a special
committee  with  respect   to  all   other  eligible   employees  and   eligible
nonemployees.
 
    During  calendar year 1995,  up to 2,200,000  shares of Communications Stock
and 1,485,000  shares of  Media  Stock were  available  for grant.  The  maximum
aggregate  number of shares of Communications Stock  and Media Stock that may be
granted in any  other calendar year  for all  purposes under the  Plan is  nine-
tenths  of one  percent (0.90 percent)  and three-quarters of  one percent (0.75
percent), respectively,  of  the shares  of  such class  outstanding  (excluding
shares  held in the Company's treasury) on  the first day of such calendar year.

NOTE 17: EMPLOYEE BENEFITS
 
PENSION PLAN
 
    U S WEST sponsers a defined benefit pension plan covering substantially  all
management  and occupational employees  of the Company.  Management benefits are
based on a final pay  formula, while occupational benefits  are based on a  flat
benefit  formula.  U  S WEST  uses  the  projected unit  credit  method  for the
determination of pension cost for financial reporting purposes and the aggregate
cost method  for funding  purposes.  The Company's  policy  is to  fund  amounts
required  under the  Employee Retirement Security  Act of 1974  ("ERISA") and no
funding was required in 1995, 1994 or 1993.

POSTRETIREMENT BENEFITS OTHER THAN PENSIONS
 
    U S WEST and most of its  subsidiaries provide certain health care and  life
insurance  benefits to retired employees. In conjunction with the Company's 1992
adoption of SFAS  No. 106,  "Employers' Accounting  for Postretirement  Benefits
Other  Than Pensions," U S WEST elected to immediately recognize the accumulated
postretirement benefit obligation for current and future retirees. However,  the
Federal   Communications  Commission  and  certain  state  jurisdictions  permit
amortization of the  transition obligation  over the  average remaining  service
period  of  active  employees  for  regulatory  accounting  purposes  with  most
jurisdictions requiring funding as a stipulation for rate recovery.

    A one-percent increase in the assumed  health care cost trend rate for  each
future  year would have increased the aggregate of the service and interest cost
components of  1995 net  postretirement benefit  cost by  approximately $40  and
increased   the   1995   accumulated   postretirement   benefit   obligation  by
approximately $350.
 
    For U S WEST, the annual funding  amount is based on its cash  requirements,

    The  current portion of the deferred tax asset was $282 and $352 at December
31, 1995 and 1994, respectively, resulting primarily from restructuring  charges
and compensation-related items.
 
    On  August 10,  1993, federal  legislation was  enacted which  increased the
corporate tax rate from 34 percent to 35 percent retroactive to January 1, 1993.
The cumulative effect on deferred taxes of the 1993 increase in income tax rates
was $74, including $20 for the capital assets segment.
 
    The net  deferred tax  liability includes  $686  in 1995  and $678  in  1994
related to the capital assets segment.
 
NOTE 19: CONTINGENCIES
    At  U S  WEST Communications there  are pending regulatory  actions in local
regulatory jurisdictions that call for price decreases, refunds or both. In  one
such  instance,  the  Utah Supreme  Court  has  remanded a  Utah  Public Service
Commission ("PSC") order  to the PSC  for reconsideration, thereby  establishing
two  exceptions to  the rule against  retroactive ratemaking:  1) unforeseen and
extraordinary events, and 2) misconduct. The PSC's initial order denied a refund
request from interexchange carriers and other parties related to the Tax  Reform
Act  of 1986. This action is still in  the discovery process. If a formal filing
- -- made in accordance with the remand from the Supreme Court -- alleges that the
exceptions apply, the range of possible risk to U S WEST Communications is $0 to
$150.
 
    On September 22, 1995, U S WEST  filed a lawsuit in Delaware Chancery  Court
to  enjoin the proposed merger of Time  Warner and Turner Broadcasting. U S WEST
has alleged  breaches  of  contract  and fiduciary  duties  by  Time  Warner  in
connection  with this proposed merger. Time Warner filed a countersuit against U
S WEST on October 11, 1995,  alleging misrepresentation, breach of contract  and
other  misconduct on  the part of  U S  WEST. Time Warner's  countersuit seeks a
reformation of the  Time Warner  Entertainment partnership  agreement, an  order
that  enjoins U S WEST from breaching the partnership agreement, and unspecified
compensatory damages. U S WEST  has denied each of  the claims in Time  Warner's
countersuit.  The trial for this action concluded on March 22, 1996. A ruling by
the Delaware Chancery Court is expected in June 1996.

             NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (CONTINUED)
 
NOTE 20: NET INVESTMENT IN ASSETS HELD FOR SALE
    The Consolidated Financial Statements include the discontinued operations of
the capital assets  segment. During the  second quarter  of 1993, the  U S  WEST
Board  of Directors  approved a  plan to dispose  of the  capital assets segment
through the  sale of  segment assets  and businesses.  Accordingly, the  Company
recorded  an after-tax charge of $100 for  the estimated loss on disposition. An
additional provision of $20  is related to  the effect of  the 1993 increase  in
federal income tax rates. The capital assets segment includes activities related
to  financial  services  and  financial  guarantee  insurance  operations.  Also
included in the segment is U S WEST Real Estate, Inc., for which disposition was
announced in 1991 and a $500  valuation allowance was established to cover  both
carrying costs and losses on disposal of related properties.
 
    Effective January 1, 1995, the capital assets segment has been accounted for
in  accordance with Staff  Accounting Bulletin No. 93,  issued by the Securities
Exchange Commission,  which requires  discontinued  operations not  disposed  of
within  one year of  the measurement date  to be accounted  for prospectively in
continuing operations as  a "net investment  in assets held  for sale." The  net
realizable  value  of  the  assets  is  reevaluated  on  an  ongoing  basis with
adjustments to the existing reserve,  if any, charged to continuing  operations.
No  such adjustment was required  in 1995. Prior to  January 1, 1995, the entire
capital  assets  segment  was  accounted  for  as  discontinued  operations   in
accordance with Accounting Principles Board Opinion No. 30.
 
    During  1994, U S WEST reduced  its ownership interest in Financial Security
Assurance Holdings, Ltd.  ("FSA"), a member  of the capital  assets segment,  to
60.9  percent,  and its  voting interest  to  49.8 percent  through a  series of
transactions. In May and  June 1994, U  S WEST sold 8.1  million shares of  FSA,
including  2  million shares  sold to  Fund  American Enterprises  Holdings Inc.
("FFC"), in an initial public  offering of FSA common  stock. U S WEST  received
$154  in net proceeds from the offering.  The Media Group retained certain risks
in asset-backed obligations related to the commercial real estate portfolio.  On
September 2, 1994, U S WEST issued to FFC 50,000 shares of cumulative redeemable
preferred  stock for a total of $50.  (See Note 13 to the Consolidated Financial
Statements.) In December 1995, FSA merged with Capital Guaranty Corporation  for
shares  of FSA and cash of $51. The transaction was valued at approximately $203
and reduced U S WEST's ownership interest in FSA to 50.3 percent and its  voting
interest to 41.7 percent. U S WEST expects to monetize and ultimately reduce its
ownership  in FSA  through the  issuance of  Debt Exchangeable  for Common Stock
("DECS") in 1996. At maturity,  each DECS will be  mandatorily exchanged by U  S
WEST  for shares of FSA common stock held by  U S WEST or, at U S WEST's option,
redeemed at the cash equivalent.
 
    U S WEST  entered into  a transaction to  reduce its  investment in  Enhance
Financial  Services Group, Inc. ("Enhance") during fourth-quarter 1995. U S WEST
issued DECS due December 15, 1998. Upon maturity, each DECS will be  mandatorily
exchanged  by U  S WEST for  shares of  Enhance common stock  or, at  U S WEST's
option, redeemed at the  cash equivalent. The  capital assets segment  currently
owns  approximately 31.5 percent  of the outstanding  Enhance common stock. (See
Note 10 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.)
 
    U S WEST Real Estate, Inc.  has sold various properties totaling $120,  $327
and  $66 in each of  the three years ended  December 31, 1995, respectively. The
sales proceeds were in  line with estimates. Proceeds  from building sales  were
primarily  used to repay  related debt. U  S WEST has  completed construction of
existing buildings  in  the commercial  real  estate portfolio  and  expects  to
substantially  complete the liquidation of this portfolio by 1998. The remaining
balance of assets subject to sale is approximately $490, net of reserves, as  of
December 31, 1995.
 
    In  December 1993, U S WEST sold $2.0 billion of finance receivables and the
business of U S WEST Financial Services, Inc. to NationsBank Corporation.  Sales
proceeds  of $2.1 billion were used primarily  to repay related debt. The pretax
gain on the sale  of approximately $100,  net of selling  expenses, was in  line

with  management's  estimate  and  was included  in  the  Company's  estimate of
provision for loss on disposal. The management team that previously operated the
entire capital assets segment transferred to NationsBank.
 
    Building sales and  operating revenues  of the capital  assets segment  were
$237,  $553  and  $710  in  1995,  1994  and  1993,  respectively.  Income  from
discontinued operations for 1993 (to June 1) totaled $38. Income (loss) from the
capital assets  segment subsequent  to June  1, 1993  is being  deferred and  is
included within the reserve for assets held for sale.
 
    The  assets  and  liabilities  of  the  capital  assets  segment  have  been
separately classified on the  Consolidated Balance Sheets  as net investment  in
assets held for sale.

* Actual
 
(1)
  1995  net income  includes a  gain of $85  ($0.18 per  share) on  the sales of
  certain rural telephone exchanges and other charges of $16 ($0.03 per  share),
  including  an extraordinary charge of $8  for the early extinguishment of debt
  and $8 for costs associated with  the November 1, 1995 recapitalization.  1994
  net  income includes a gain  of $51 ($0.11 per share)  on the sales of certain
  rural telephone exchanges. 1993 net income was reduced by a $534 restructuring
  charge and  $54  for the  cumulative  effect on  deferred  taxes of  the  1993
  federally  mandated increase  in income  tax rates.  1993 net  income was also
  reduced by extraordinary charges of $3,123 for the discontinuance of Statement
  of Financial  Accounting Standards  ("SFAS")  No. 71  and  $77 for  the  early
  extinguishment  of  debt.  1992  net  income was  reduced  by  $1,745  for the
  cumulative effect  of change  in accounting  principles. 1991  net income  was
  reduced by a $173 restructuring charge.
 
(2)
  Effective  November 1,  1995, each share  of U  S WEST, Inc.  common stock was
  converted into one share  each of U S  WEST Communications Group common  stock
  and  U S WEST  Media Group common  stock. Earnings per  common share have been
  presented on a pro forma basis to reflect the two classes of stock as if  they
  had  been  outstanding  since  January  1,  1994.  For  periods  prior  to the
  recapitalization, the  average common  shares outstanding  are assumed  to  be
  equal to the average common shares outstanding for U S WEST, Inc.
 
(3)
  Earnings   before  interest,  taxes,   depreciation,  amortization  and  other
  ("EBITDA"). EBITDA  also  excludes  the  gain  on  sales  of  rural  telephone
  exchanges and restructuring charges. The Communications Group considers EBITDA
  an  important indicator  of the  operational strength  and performance  of its
  businesses. EBITDA, however,  should not  be considered as  an alternative  to
  operating   or  net  income  as  an   indicator  of  the  performance  of  the
  Communications Group's  businesses or  as an  alternative to  cash flows  from
  operating  activities as  a measure of  liquidity, in each  case determined in
  accordance with generally accepted accounting principles.
 
(4)
  The increases  in  the percentage  of  debt to  total  capital and  return  on
  Communications  Group equity, and the  decrease in Communications Group equity
  since 1992, are primarily due to the  effects of discontinuing SFAS No. 71  in
  1993 and the cumulative effect of change in accounting principles in 1992.
 
(5)
  1995  return  on  Communications  Group  equity  is  based  on  income  before
  extraordinary items. For 1994, there are no adjustments to net income for this
  calculation. 1993 return  on Communications  Group equity is  based on  income
  excluding  extraordinary  items,  a restructuring  charge  and  the cumulative
  effect on deferred taxes of the 1993 federally mandated increase in income tax
  rates. 1992 return on  Communications Group equity is  based on income  before
  cumulative   effect  of  change  in  accounting  principles.  1991  return  on
  Communications Group equity  is based  on income  excluding the  effects of  a
  restructuring charge.

                 FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS
                (DOLLARS IN MILLIONS, EXCEPT PER SHARE AMOUNTS)
THE RECAPITALIZATION PLAN
 
    On  October  31,  1995, the  shareholders  of  U S  WEST,  Inc.,  a Colorado
corporation  ("U  S  WEST   Colorado"),  voted  to   approve  a  proposal   (the
"Recapitalization  Plan") adopted by the Board  of Directors to reincorporate in
Delaware and  create two  classes of  common stock.  Under the  Recapitalization
Plan,  shareholders approved an  Agreement and Plan  of Merger between  U S WEST
Colorado and  U  S  WEST, Inc.,  a  Delaware  corporation ("U  S  WEST"  or  the
"Company"),  pursuant to which U S  WEST continues as the surviving corporation.
In connection with the merger, the Certificate of Incorporation of U S WEST  has
been  amended and restated to designate two classes of common stock of U S WEST,
one class of which is authorized as  U S WEST Communications Group Common  Stock
("Communications  Stock") and the  other class which  is authorized as  U S WEST
Media Group Common Stock ("Media Stock").
 
    The Communications  Stock  and Media  Stock  provide shareholders  with  two
distinct  securities that are intended  to reflect separately the communications
businesses  of  U  S  WEST  (the  "Communications  Group")  and  the  multimedia
businesses  of U S WEST (the "Media Group" and, together with the Communications
Group, the "Groups").
 
THE COMMUNICATIONS GROUP
 
    The  Communications  Group   primarily  provides  regulated   communications
services  to  more than  25 million  residential and  business customers  in the
Communications Group Region (the  "Region"). The Region  includes the states  of
Arizona,  Colorado, Idaho, Iowa, Minnesota, Montana, Nebraska, New Mexico, North
Dakota, Oregon, South Dakota, Utah, Washington and Wyoming. Services offered  by
the  Communications  Group  include local  telephone  services,  exchange access
services (which  connect  customers to  the  facilities of  carriers,  including
long-distance  providers  and  wireless operators),  and  long-distance services
within  Local  Access  and  Transport   Areas  ("LATAs")  in  the  Region.   The
Communications  Group  provides other  products  and services,  including custom
calling  features,  voice  messaging,  caller  identification,  high-speed  data
applications, customer premises equipment and certain communications services to
business customers and governmental agencies both inside and outside the Region.
The  Telecommunications Act of 1996, enacted into  law on February 8, 1996, will
dramatically alter the competitive landscape of the telecommunications  industry
and  will further  change the nature  of services the  Communications Group will
offer. These future service  offerings include interLATA long-distance  service,
wireless  services, cable TV and  interconnection services provided to competing
providers of local services.
 
    The Combined Financial Statements of  the Communications Group include:  (i)
the  combined historical balance sheets, results of operations and cash flows of
the businesses that comprise the Communications Group; (ii) corporate assets and
liabilities  and  related  transactions  of   U  S  WEST  identified  with   the
Communications  Group; and (iii) an allocated  portion of the corporate expenses
of U  S  WEST. All  significant  intra-group financial  transactions  have  been
eliminated.  Transactions between the  Communications Group and  the Media Group
have not been eliminated. For a more complete discussion of U S WEST's corporate
allocation policies, see the  U S WEST  Communications Group Combined  Financial
Statements -- Note 2: Summary of Significant Accounting Policies.
 
    The  following  discussion is  based on  the U  S WEST  Communications Group
Combined Financial  Statements prepared  in accordance  with generally  accepted
accounting  principles ("GAAP").  The discussion  should be  read in conjunction
with the U S WEST, Inc. Consolidated Financial Statements.

- ------------------------------
1 1995  income  before extraordinary  items includes  a gain  of $85  ($0.18 per
  share) on the  sales of certain  rural telephone exchanges  and $8 ($0.01  per
  share) for costs associated with the Recapitalization Plan.
 
2 1994  income  before extraordinary  items includes  a gain  of $51  ($0.11 per
  share) on the sales of certain rural telephone exchanges.
 
3 Earnings per common share have been presented  on a pro forma basis as if  the
  Communications  Stock had been outstanding since  January 1, 1994. For periods
  prior to  the  recapitalization, the  average  common shares  outstanding  are
  assumed to be equal to the average common shares outstanding for U S WEST.
 
    The Communications Group's 1995 income before extraordinary items, excluding
the  effects  of one-time  items described  in Note  1 to  the table  above, was
$1,107, an increase of $8,  or 0.7 percent, compared  with $1,099 in 1994,  also
excluding the effects of one-time items. Total revenue growth of 3.4 percent was
largely  offset  by  significantly  higher costs  incurred  to  improve customer
service and meet greater than expected  business growth. Net income growth  will
also  be  limited in  1996 while  the Communications  Group continues  to commit
significant resources to meet customer service objectives and broaden its  range
of product and service offerings.
 
    Excluding  the effects of  one-time items described  in Note 1  to the table
above, pro forma earnings per common share before extraordinary items ("earnings
per share") were $2.35 in  1995, a decrease of  $0.07, or 2.9 percent,  compared
with  $2.42  in 1994,  similarly adjusted.  Earnings per  share in  1995 reflect
approximately 17 million additional average common shares outstanding, of  which
12.8 million were issued in December 1994.
 
    During  1995, the  Communications Group  refinanced $145  of long-term debt.
Expenses associated with the refinancings  resulted in extraordinary charges  of
$8, net of tax benefits of $5.
 
    Increased  demand  for  services  resulted  in  growth  in  earnings  before
interest, taxes, depreciation, amortization and other ("EBITDA") of 4.8  percent
in  1995. The Communications Group believes  EBITDA is an important indicator of
the operational  strength of  its  businesses. EBITDA,  however, should  not  be
considered  as an  alternative to  operating or  net income  as an  indicator of
performance or as an  alternative to cash flows  from operating activities as  a
measure  of  liquidity, in  each case  determined  in accordance  with generally
accepted accounting principles ("GAAP").

</TABLE>
 
    Approximately 97 percent  of the  revenues of the  Communications Group  are
attributable  to the  operations of  U S  WEST Communications,  Inc. ("U  S WEST
Communications"), of which approximately 59 percent are derived from the  states
of  Arizona, Colorado, Minnesota and Washington. Approximately 29 percent of the
access lines in service are devoted to providing services to business customers.
The access line growth rate for business customers, who tend to be heavier users
of the  network,  has  consistently  exceeded the  growth  rate  of  residential
customers. During 1995, business access lines grew 5.4 percent while residential
access lines increased 2.8 percent.
 
    The  primary factors that influence changes  in revenues are customer demand
for products and services, price changes (including those related to  regulatory
proceedings)  and refunds.  During 1995, revenues  from new  product and service
offerings were  $534,  an increase  of  58  percent compared  with  1994.  These
revenues  primarily  consist  of caller  identification,  voice  messaging, call
waiting and high-speed data network transmission services.
 
    Local service revenues include local telephone exchange, local private  line
and  public  telephone  services.  In  1995,  local  service  revenues increased
principally as a  result of  higher demand for  new and  existing services,  and
demand for second lines. Local service revenues from new services increased $92,
or  78  percent,  compared  with 1994.  Reported  total  access  lines increased
511,000, or  3.6  percent, of  which  161,000  were second  lines.  Second  line
installations  increased 25.5 percent compared with 1994. Access line growth was
4.2 percent adjusted for the sale of approximately 95,000 rural telephone access
lines during the last 12 months.
 
    Access charges are collected primarily from interexchange carriers for their
use of the local exchange network. For interstate access services there is  also
a  fee collected directly from telephone  customers. Approximately 33 percent of
access revenues and  11 percent  of total  revenues are  derived from  providing
access services to AT&T.
 
    Higher  revenues from interstate access services  were driven by an increase
of 9.2  percent  in interstate  billed  access  minutes of  use.  The  increased
business  volume more than  offset the effects of  price reductions and refunds.
The Communications Group reduced prices  for interstate access services in  both
1995  and 1994 as  a result of Federal  Communications Commission ("FCC") orders
and competitive pressures. Intrastate access revenues increased primarily due to
the impact  of  increased  business  volume and  multiple  toll  carrier  plans,
partially offset by the impact of rate changes.
 
    Long-distance   revenues  are  derived  from  calls  made  within  the  LATA
boundaries of  the Region.  During 1995  and 1994,  long-distance revenues  were
impacted  by  the implementation  of multiple  toll  carrier plans  ("MTCPs") in
Oregon and Washington in May and July 1994, respectively. The MTCPs  essentially
allow  independent telephone companies to act  as toll carriers. The 1995 impact
of the  MTCPs was  long-distance  revenue losses  of  $62, partially  offset  by
increases   in  intrastate  access  revenues  of  $12  and  decreases  in  other

operating expenses  (i.e.  access expense)  of  $42 compared  with  1994.  These
regulatory  arrangements have decreased annual  net income by approximately $10.
Similar changes  in other  states could  occur, though  the impact  on 1996  net
income would not be material.
 
    Excluding  the effects of the MTCPs, long-distance revenues decreased by 5.9
percent  in  1995,  primarily  due  to  the  effects  of  competition  and  rate
reductions.  Long-distance revenues have declined over the last several years as
customers have migrated to interexchange carriers that have the ability to offer
these services on both an intraLATA  and interLATA basis. A portion of  revenues
lost  to competition, however,  is recovered through access  charges paid by the
interexchange carriers. Erosion  in long-distance revenue  will continue due  to
the loss of 1+ dialing in Minnesota, effective in February 1996, and in Arizona,
effective  in April 1996. Annual  long-distance revenue losses could approximate
$30 as  a  result  of  these changes.  The  Communications  Group  is  partially
mitigating   competitive  losses   through  competitive   pricing  of  intraLATA
long-distance services.
 
    Revenues from other  services primarily  consist of  billing and  collection
services   provided  to   interexchange  carriers,   voice  messaging  services,
high-speed data transmission  services, sales of  service agreements related  to
inside  wiring and the  provision of customer  premises equipment. Revenues from
other services  also include  directory listings,  customer lists,  billing  and
collection  and other services  provided to the Media  Group. These services are
sold at  market  price.  However,  the  Communications  Group's  accounting  and
reporting for regulatory purposes is in accordance with regulatory requirements.
Revenues for services provided to Media Group were $20 in 1995 and $29 in 1994.
 
    During  1995, revenues  from other  services increased  $44, primarily  as a
result of continued market penetration in voice messaging services and sales  of
high-speed  data transmission  services. Revenue  growth from  other services is
also attributable to maintenance contracts for inside wire services and a  large
contract  related to a wire installation project. These increases were partially
offset by a decrease  of $20 in revenues  from billing and collection  services.
The  decline in  billing and collection  revenues is primarily  related to lower
contract prices and a decrease in the volume of services provided to AT&T.

</TABLE>
 
    Employee-related  expenses  include  basic  salaries  and  wages,  overtime,
benefits  (including pension and health care), payroll taxes and contract labor.
During 1995, improving  customer service  was the  Communications Group's  first
priority.  Overtime payments and contract labor expense associated with customer
service initiatives  increased  employee-related  costs  by  approximately  $168
compared  with 1994.  Expenses related  to the  addition of  approximately 1,700
employees in 1995 and  1,000 employees in  1994 also increased  employee-related
costs. These expenses were incurred to handle the higher than anticipated volume
of  business and to meet new  business opportunities. Partially offsetting these
increases was a $34 reduction in the accrual for postretirement benefits, a  $22
decrease  in travel expense and reduced expenses related to employee separations
under reengineering and streamlining initiatives. The Communications Group  will
continue  to add employees to address customer  service issues and growth in the
core business. Costs related to these work-force additions will partially offset
the benefits  of  employee  separations  achieved  through  restructuring.  (See
"Restructuring Charge.")

    Other operating expenses include access charges (incurred for the routing of
long-distance  traffic through the facilities of independent companies), network
software  expenses  and  other  general  and  administrative  costs,   including
allocated  costs from U S WEST.  During 1995, other operating expenses decreased
primarily due to the effects of the multiple toll carrier plans and a  reduction
in  expenses related  to project funding  at Bell  Communications Research, Inc.
("Bellcore"), of  which U  S  WEST Communications  has a  one-seventh  ownership
interest.  These decreases in other operating  expenses were partially offset by
increases in costs associated with increased sales, including bad debt  expense.
Allocated costs from U S WEST were $116 and $110 in 1995 and 1994, respectively.
 
    Taxes  other than income  taxes, which consist  primarily of property taxes,
decreased  2.1  percent  in  1995,  primarily  due  to  favorable  property  tax
valuations  and  mill  levies  as  compared with  1994.  As  a  result  of these
valuations and  mill  levies,  1995 fourth-quarter  accruals  decreased  by  $20
compared with fourth-quarter 1994.
 
    Increased  depreciation  and amortization  expense  was attributable  to the
effects of a higher depreciable asset  base, partially offset by the effects  of
the sales of certain rural telephone exchanges.
 
    Interest expense increased primarily as a result of an increased use of debt
financing. The average borrowing cost was 6.9 percent in 1995, compared with 6.8
percent  in 1994. (See "Liquidity and Capital Resources.") The increase in other
expense  is  largely   attributable  to   $8  of  costs   associated  with   the
Recapitalization Plan in 1995.

RESTRUCTURING CHARGE
 
    The Communications  Group's 1993  results  reflected an  $880  restructuring
charge  (pretax). The related  restructuring plan (the  "Restructuring Plan") is
designed to provide faster, more responsive customer services while reducing the
costs of  providing these  services.  As part  of  the Restructuring  Plan,  the
Communications Group is developing new systems and enhanced system functionality
that  will  enable  it  to  monitor  networks  to  reduce  the  risk  of service
interruptions, activate telephone service on demand, rapidly design and engineer
products and services  for customers,  and centralize its  service centers.  The
Communications  Group has consolidated its 560  customer service centers into 26
centers in  10 cities  and plans  on reducing  its work  force by  approximately
10,000  employees.  All service  centers are  operational  and supported  by new
systems and enhanced system functionality.
 
    The Restructuring Plan is expected to  be substantially complete by the  end
of 1997. Implementation of the Restructuring Plan has been impacted by growth in
the  business and related service  issues, new business opportunities, revisions
to system  delivery  schedules  and  productivity issues  caused  by  the  major
rearrangement  of resources due to restructuring.  These issues will continue to
affect the timing of employee separations.
 
    The Communications  Group estimates  that full  implementation of  the  1993
Restructuring  Plan will reduce employee-related  expenses by approximately $400
per year. The  savings related to  work-force reductions will  be offset by  the
effects of inflation and a variety of other factors. These factors include costs
related  to the achievement of customer  service objectives and increased demand
for existing services. (See "Costs and Expenses.")

1 Employee separation  costs,  including the  balance  of a  1991  restructuring
  reserve at December 31, 1993, aggregate $311.
 
    Employee  separation costs include  severance payments, health-care coverage
and postemployment  education benefits.  Systems development  costs include  new
systems  and  the  application  of enhanced  system  functionality  to existing,
single-purpose systems to provide integrated, end-to-end customer service.  Real
estate  costs  include  preparation  costs  for  the  new  service  centers. The
relocation and  retraining costs  are related  to moving  employees to  the  new
service  centers and retraining employees on the methods and systems required in
the new, restructured mode of operation.
 
    EMPLOYEE SEPARATION.  Under the Restructuring Plan, the Communications Group
anticipates the separation  of 10,000 employees.  Approximately 1,000  employees
that  were originally expected  to relocate have chosen  separation or other job
assignments and  have  been replaced.  This  increased the  number  of  employee
separations  to 10,000  from 9,000, and  increased the estimated  total cost for
employee separations to $311 from $281, as compared with the original  estimate.
The   $30  cost  associated  with  these  additional  employee  separations  was
reclassified from  relocation to  the reserve  for employee  separations  during
1995.
 
    Annual  employee  separations  and  employee-separation  amounts  under  the
Restructuring Plan follow:

                    MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF
           FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (CONTINUED)
 
    Compared with  the original  estimates, employee  reductions and  separation
amounts  shown above have been reduced by 1,600 employees and $53, respectively,
in 1996, and increased by 4,495 employees and $127, respectively, in 1997.
 
    SYSTEMS DEVELOPMENT.    The  existing information  management  systems  were
largely  developed  to  support  a  monopoly  environment.  These  systems  were
inadequate due to the effects of increased competition, new forms of  regulation
and  changing  technology  that have  driven  consumer demand  for  products and
services  that  can  be  delivered  quickly,  reliably  and  economically.   The
Communications Group believes that improved customer service, delivered at lower
cost,  can  be achieved  by a  combination  of new  systems and  introducing new
functionality to existing systems.  This is a change  from the initial  strategy
which placed more emphasis on the development of new systems.
 
    The  systems development  program involves  new systems  and enhanced system
functionality for systems that support the following core processes:
 
        SERVICE DELIVERY -- to  support service on demand  for all products  and
    services.  These new systems  and enhanced system  functionality will permit
    customer calls to be directed to those service representatives who can  meet
    their  requirements. This process  will provide enhanced  information to the
    service representatives regarding the customer  requests and the ability  of
    the Communications Group to fulfill them.
 
        SERVICE  ASSURANCE -- for  performance monitoring from  one location and
    remote  testing  in  the  new  environment,  including  identification   and
    resolution of faults prior to customer impact.
 
        CAPACITY  PROVISIONING  --  for integrated  planning  of  future network
    capacity,  including  the  installation  of  software  controllable  service
    components.
 
    Certain  of  the new  systems and  enhanced  system functionality  have been
implemented in  the  service centers  and  have simplified  the  labor-intensive
interfaces  between systems  processes in  existence prior  to the Restructuring
Plan. Enhanced  system functionality  introduced  under the  Restructuring  Plan
since its inception includes the following:
 
    - The  ability to determine  facilities' availability while  the customer is
      placing an order;
 
    - Automated engineering of central office facilities and automated  updating
      of central office facilities' records;
 
    - The  ability to track the  status of complex network  design jobs from the
      customer's perspective; and
 
    - Systems that  accurately  diagnose  network problems  and  prepare  repair
      packages to correct the problems identified.
 
    The  direct, incremental and nonrecurring costs of providing new systems and
enhanced system functionality follow:

computers, in  addition to  systems costs  related to  maintenance of  telephone
network  applications.  Other  systems  expenses  are  for  administrative (i.e.
general purpose) systems  which include customer  service, order entry,  billing
and collection, accounts payable, payroll, human resources and property records.
Ongoing  systems costs  comprised approximately  six percent  of total operating
expenses in 1995, 1994 and 1993. The Communications Group expects systems  costs
charged  to  current operations  as  a percent  of  total operating  expenses to
approximate the  current level  throughout 1996.  Systems costs  could  increase
relative  to  other  operating costs  as  the business  becomes  more technology
dependent.

                         U S WEST COMMUNICATIONS GROUP
                    MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF
           FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (CONTINUED)
 
    The Communications  Group's  1994  income  before  extraordinary  items  was
$1,099,  an increase of $120, or 12.3 percent, over 1993, excluding the one-time
effects described  in  Notes 1  and  2 to  the  table above.  The  increase  was
primarily attributable to increased demand for telecommunications services.
 
    In  1993, U  S WEST  Communications incurred  extraordinary charges  for the
discontinuance of Statement of Financial  Accounting Standards ("SFAS") No.  71,
"Accounting  for  the Effects  of Certain  Types of  Regulation," and  the early
extinguishment of debt. An extraordinary, noncash charge of $3.1 billion  (after
tax) was incurred in conjunction with the decision to discontinue accounting for
the  operations of U S WEST Communications  in accordance with SFAS No. 71. SFAS
No. 71 generally applies to regulated companies that meet certain  requirements,
including a requirement that a company be able to recover its costs, competition
notwithstanding,  by  charging  its  customers  at  prices  established  by  its
regulators. This decision  to discontinue  the application  of SFAS  No. 71  was
based  on  the  belief  that competition,  market  conditions  and technological
advances, more than prices established by regulators, will determine the  future
cost  recovery  by U  S WEST  Communications. As  a result  of this  change, the
remaining asset lives of U S WEST Communications' telephone plant were shortened
to more closely  reflect the useful  (economic) lives  of such plant.  U S  WEST
Communications'  accounting  and  reporting  for  regulatory  purposes  were not
affected by the change.
 
    During 1993,  U  S  WEST Communications  refinanced  long-term  debt  issues
aggregating  $2.7 billion  in principal amount.  These refinancings  allowed U S
WEST Communications to take advantage of favorable interest rates. Extraordinary
costs associated with the redemptions reduced 1993 income by $77 (after tax).
 
    Revenue growth, partially  offset by higher  operating expenses, provided  a
7.6 percent increase in EBITDA.

</TABLE>
 
    In  1994, local service revenues increased principally as a result of higher
demand for services. Reported access  lines increased by 3.6 percent.  Excluding
the  sale  of approximately  60,000 rural  telephone  access lines  during 1994,
access line growth was 4.0 percent.
 
    Higher revenues from interstate access services were primarily  attributable
to  an increase of 7.8 percent in interstate billed access minutes of use, which
more than  offset the  effects  of price  decreases. Intrastate  access  charges
increased  primarily as a result of  higher demand, including demand for private
line services.
 
    Long-distance revenues decreased principally due to the effects of the MTCPs
implemented in Oregon  and Washington.  The 1994  impact was  a loss  of $68  in
long-distance revenues, partially offset by a decrease of $48 in other operating
expenses  and an increase of $10  in intrastate access revenue. These regulatory
arrangements decreased net income by approximately $6 in 1994.
 
    During 1994, revenues from  other services increased  due to higher  revenue
from  billing and  collection services and  increased market  penetration of new
service offerings. Partially offsetting the increase in other services  revenues
was  the 1993 sale of telephone equipment distribution operations, completion of
large telephone network installation contracts  and lower revenue from  customer
premises  equipment installations. Revenues  for services provided  to the Media
Group were $29 in 1994 and $26 in 1993.

    In 1994, overtime payments, contract labor and basic salaries and wages, all
related  to  the  implementation  of  major  customer  service  and streamlining
initiatives, increased by $150. A $71 reduction in the amount of pension  credit
allocated  to  the  Communications Group  also  contributed to  the  increase in
employee-related expenses. Actuarial assumptions, which include decreases in the
discount rate  and  the  expected  long-term rate  of  return  on  plan  assets,
contributed   to  the  pension  credit  reduction.  Partially  offsetting  these
increases were the effects  of employees leaving  under the Restructuring  Plan,
lower  health-care  benefit  costs, including  a  reduction in  the  accrual for
postretirement benefits, and lower incentive compensation payments to employees.
 
    Other operating expenses decreased primarily due to the effect of the MTCPs.
Lower customer premises equipment installations  and lower expenses at  Bellcore
also  contributed to the decrease. Allocated costs assigned from U S WEST to the
Communications Group totaled $110 and $117  in 1994 and 1993, respectively.  The
increase  in depreciation and amortization expense was primarily the result of a
higher depreciable asset base and increased rates of depreciation.
 
    Interest expense decreased due to the  effects of refinancing debt at  lower
rates  in 1993 at U S WEST Communications, and a reclassification of capitalized
interest in 1994. Since the discontinuance of SFAS No. 71, interest  capitalized
as  a component of telephone plant construction is recorded as an offset against
interest expense  rather  than  to other  expense.  The  Communications  Group's
average  borrowing cost  was 6.8  percent in 1994  compared with  6.9 percent in
1993.

Effective tax rate......................................................       36.2%        34.7%       --
</TABLE>
 
    The increase in the effective tax  rate resulted primarily from the  effects
of discontinuing SFAS No. 71, an increase in 1994 income before income taxes and
the  1993 restructuring  charge, partially  offset by  the cumulative  effect on
deferred income taxes  of the  1993 federally  mandated increase  in income  tax
rates.
 
LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES -- THREE YEARS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 1995
 
OPERATING ACTIVITIES
 
    Cash from operations increased $210 in 1995 primarily due to the increase in
EBITDA and a decrease in the cash funding for postretirement benefits, partially
offset  by higher payments for restructuring charges. Cash provided by operating
activities decreased by  $168 in 1994  compared with 1993,  largely due to  cash
payments  for restructuring  activities of $279  in 1994, compared  with $120 in
1993. Further details of cash provided  by operating activities are provided  in
the Combined Statements of Cash Flows.

           FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (CONTINUED)
 
    The  future cash needs of the Communications  Group may increase as a result
of new  business opportunities,  including wireless  services, and  requirements
related to the recently enacted Telecommunications Act of 1996.
 
INVESTING ACTIVITIES
 
    Total capital expenditures were $2,739 in 1995, $2,477 in 1994 and $2,226 in
1993. The 1995 capital expenditures exceeded the 1994 and 1993 levels due to the
Communications Group's efforts to improve customer service (including reductions
in held orders) and to accommodate additional line capability in several states.
Capital  expenditures related to the  Restructuring Plan were approximately $190
in 1995 as compared to $265 in 1994. In 1996, capital expenditures are  expected
to  approximate $2.5 billion. Included in the 1996 capital expenditures estimate
are costs to enter  new markets as allowed  under the Telecommunications Act  of
1996.
 
    The  Communications Group received cash proceeds of $214 and $93 in 1995 and
1994, respectively, for the  sales of certain  rural telephone exchanges.  Since
implementing  its  rural telephone  exchange  sales program,  the Communications
Group has  sold  approximately 155,000  access  lines. Planned  sales  of  rural
exchanges for 1996 and beyond aggregate approximately 180,000 lines.
 
FINANCING ACTIVITIES
 
    Debt  increased by $630  in 1995, primarily  due to the  increase in capital
expenditures. The percentage of debt to total capital at year-end 1995 was 66.0.
During 1994, debt increased $451, though the percentage of debt to total capital
declined to 65.8 at year-end  1994 from 67.6 at  year-end 1993. The decrease  in
the  percentage of debt to  total capital in 1994  was primarily attributable to
higher net income and issuances of equity.
 
    During 1995, U S WEST  Communications refinanced $1.5 billion of  commercial
paper  to take advantage  of favorable long-term interest  rates. In addition to
the commercial paper, U S WEST Communications refinanced $145 of long-term debt.
In 1993, U  S WEST  Communications refinanced  $2.7 billion  of long-term  debt.
Expenses   associated  with  the  refinancing  of  long-term  debt  resulted  in
extraordinary after-tax charges to income of $8 and $77, net of tax benefits  of
$5 and $48, in 1995 and 1993, respectively.
 
    U  S WEST and U S WEST  Communications maintain commercial paper programs to
finance short-term cash flow requirements, as well as to maintain a presence  in
the short-term debt market. In addition, U S WEST Communications is permitted to
borrow  up to $600 under short-term lines  of credit, all of which was available
at December 31, 1995. Additional lines of credit aggregating approximately  $1.3
billion  are available to both the Media Group and the nonregulated subsidiaries
in the  Communications Group  in accordance  with their  borrowing needs.  Under
registration  statements  filed  with  the  Securities  and  Exchange Commission
("SEC"), as of December 31, 1995, U S WEST Communications is permitted to  issue
up  to $320 of new debt securities.  An additional $1.2 billion in securities is
permitted to  be issued  under registration  statements filed  with the  SEC  to
support the requirements of the Media Group and the nonregulated subsidiaries in
the Communications Group.
 
    In  connection with U S  WEST's February 27, 1996  announcement of a planned
merger with Continental  Cablevision, U S  WEST, Inc.'s credit  rating is  being
reviewed  by  credit rating  agencies, which  may result  in a  downgrading. The
credit rating of U S WEST Communications was not placed under review by Moody's,
has been reaffirmed by Duff and Phelps and is under review by Fitch and Standard
& Poors.
 
    Financing activities for  the nonregulated  Communications Group  businesses
and  the  Media  Group,  including the  issuance,  repayment  and  repurchase of
short-term and  long-term debt,  and the  issuance and  repurchase of  preferred
securities, are managed by U S WEST on a centralized basis. Notwithstanding such
centralized  management, financing  activities for  U S  WEST Communications are
separately identified and  accounted for  in U  S WEST's  records and  U S  WEST
Communications continues to conduct its own

borrowing  activities. Debt incurred  and investments made  by U S  WEST and its
subsidiaries on behalf of the  nonregulated Communications Group businesses  and
all  debt  incurred  and  investments  made  by  U  S  WEST  Communications  are
specifically  allocated  and  reflected  on  the  financial  statements  of  the
Communications  Group. All other debt incurred and  investments made by U S WEST
and its subsidiaries on behalf of the Media Group are specifically allocated  to
and reflected on the financial statements of the Media Group. Debt incurred by U
S  WEST or a  subsidiary on behalf  of a Group  is charged to  such Group at the
borrowing rate of U S WEST or such subsidiary.
 
INTEREST RATE RISK MANAGEMENT
 
    The Communications Group is exposed to market risks arising from changes  in
interest  rates. Derivative financial instruments are  used to manage this risk.
The Communications  Group  does not  use  derivative financial  instruments  for
trading purposes.
 
    The  objective of the  interest rate risk management  program is to minimize
the total cost  of debt. Interest  rate swaps are  used to adjust  the ratio  of
fixed-to  variable-rate debt. The  market value of  the debt portfolio including
the interest rate swaps is monitored and compared with predetermined  benchmarks
to evaluate the effectiveness of the risk management program.
 
    Notional  amounts of interest  rate swaps outstanding were  $784 and $781 at
December 31, 1995 and 1994,  respectively, with various maturities extending  to
2001.  The estimated effect of U S WEST Communications' interest rate derivative
transactions was to adjust the  level of fixed-rate debt  from 88 percent to  97
percent of the total debt portfolio at December 31, 1995, and from 76 percent to
86 percent of the total debt portfolio at December 31, 1994.
 
    In  conjunction  with the  1993 debt  refinancing, the  Communications Group
executed forward  contracts to  sell U.S.  Treasury bonds  to lock  in the  U.S.
Treasury  rate component of $1.5  billion of the future  debt issue. At December
31, 1995, deferred credits of $8 and  deferred charges of $51 on closed  forward
contracts are included as part of the carrying value of the underlying debt. The
deferred credits and charges are being recognized as a yield adjustment over the
life  of the debt, which matures at various dates through 2043. The net deferred
charge is directly offset by the lower coupon rate achieved on the new debt.
 
COMPETITIVE AND REGULATORY ENVIRONMENT
 
    Markets served by  the Communications  Group, including  markets for  local,
access and long-distance services, are being impacted by the rapid technological
and regulatory changes occurring within the telecommunications industry. Current
and  potential  competitors  include  local  telephone  companies, interexchange
carriers, competitive access providers ("CAPs"), cable television companies  and
providers of personal communications services ("PCS").
 
    On  February 1, 1996,  the House and  Senate approved the Telecommunications
Act of 1996 (the  "1996 Act") which is  intended to promote competition  between
local   telephone  companies,   long-distance  carriers   and  cable  television
operators. The 1996 Act was  signed into law on  February 8, 1996, and  replaces
the  antitrust consent decree that  broke up the "Bell  System" in 1984. A major
provision of the legislation includes  the preemption of state regulations  that
govern competition by allowing local telephone companies, long-distance carriers
and  cable  television  companies  to  enter  each  other's  lines  of business.
Consequently, the Regional  Bell Operating Companies  ("RBOCs") are  immediately
permitted  to  offer  wireline interLATA  toll  services out  of  their regions.
However, to  participate  in the  interLATA  long-distance market  within  their
regions,  the RBOCs  must first  open their  local networks  to facilities-based
competition by  satisfying  a  detailed  checklist  of  requirements,  including
requirements related to interconnection and number portability.
 
    Other  key provisions of the 1996 Act:  (1) eliminate most of the regulation
of  cable  television  rates  within  three  years  and  eliminate  the  ban  on
cross-ownership between cable television and telephone

companies in small communities; (2) permit the RBOCs to develop new, competitive
cable  systems  within their  regions  and to  acquire  or build  wireless cable
systems;  (3)  provide  partial  relief  from  the  ban  against   manufacturing
telecommunications  equipment by the RBOCs; and (4) permit wireless operators to
provide interLATA  toll  service  in  and  out  of  region  without  a  separate
subsidiary and to jointly market or resell cellular service.
 
    The  FCC and state  regulators have been given  latitude in interpreting and
overseeing  the  implementation  of   this  legislation,  including   developing
universal  service funding policy. The extent  and timing of future competition,
including the  Communications  Group's  ability  to  offer  in-region  interLATA
long-distance  services, will  depend in  part on  the implementation guidelines
determined by the FCC and state  regulators, and how quickly the  Communications
Group  can  satisfy  requirements  of the  checklist.  The  Communications Group
estimates that  fulfillment of  the checklist  requirements could  occur in  the
majority of its states within 12 to 18 months.
 
    The  Communications Group  believes that  competitors will  initially target
high-volume business customers in densely  populated urban areas. The  resulting
loss  of local service customers will  affect multiple revenue streams and could
have a material, adverse  effect on the  Communications Group's operations.  The
resulting  revenue losses,  however, could be  at least partially  offset by the
Communications Group's  ability  to  bundle local,  long-distance  and  wireless
services, and provide interconnection services.
 
    The  Communications Group's strategy is  to offer integrated communications,
entertainment, information and transaction services over both wired and wireless
networks to its customers  primarily within its Region.  The key initiatives  to
support this strategy include five key elements:
 
    - Providing superior customer service
 
    - Building customer loyalty
 
    - Enhancing network capability and capacity
 
    - Expanding the product and service portfolio
 
    - Ensuring a fair competitive environment
 
    Strategic initiatives to attract and retain customers include: (1) enhancing
existing  services with products such as caller identification, call waiting and
voice messaging;  (2)  aggressive  expansion  of  data  services;  (3)  pursuing
opportunities  to offer paging, wireless and  cable television services; and (4)
rapid entry into the interLATA long-distance market.
 
    A market trial for a broadband network capable of providing voice, data  and
video  services to  customers commenced  in the Omaha  area in  August 1995. The
Communications Group does not intend to expand this service offering beyond  the
Omaha  area because of service cost and pricing issues. The Communications Group
does plan to  continue to provide  the system that  delivers basic, premium  and
pay-per-view  video  services in  the Omaha  area.  The Communications  Group is
evaluating the relative costs of alternative video technologies, as well as  the
near-term feasibility of interactive services. To satisfy anticipated demand for
combined   video  and  telephony   services  on  a   cost-effective  basis,  the
Communications Group's strategy  may include selective  investments in  wireless
cable technologies.
 
    The  Communications Group is subject to varying degrees of federal and state
regulation. The Communications Group's regulatory strategy includes working to:
 
    - Achieve accelerated capital recovery;
 
    - Reprice local  services  to cover  costs  and ensure  these  services  are
      subsidy  free, while lowering  toll and access  rates to meet competition;
      and

           FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (CONTINUED)
 
    - Ensure that the new  rules associated with  the Telecommunications Act  of
      1996  concerning the unbundling of interconnection, resale of services and
      universal service do not advantage one competitor over another.
 
    The Communications Group is currently working with state regulators to  gain
approval of these initiatives.
 
OTHER REGULATORY ISSUES
 
    The  Communications Group's interstate  services have been  subject to price
cap regulation  since  January 1991.  Price  caps  are an  alternative  form  of
regulation  designed to  limit prices  rather than  profits. However,  the FCC's
price cap plan includes sharing of  earnings in excess of authorized levels.  In
March  1995, the FCC issued an interim  order on price cap regulation. The price
cap index for  most services  is annually adjusted  for inflation,  productivity
level  and exogenous costs,  and has resulted  in reduced access  prices paid by
interexchange carriers  to local  telephone companies.  The interim  order  also
provides  for three productivity options, including a no-sharing option, and for
increased flexibility for adjusting prices downward in response to  competition.
In 1995, the Communications Group selected the lowest productivity option while,
prior  to this interim  order, the Communications Group  used an optional higher
productivity factor in determining its prices. Consequently, the  Communications
Group expects the order to have no significant near-term impact.
 
    There  are pending regulatory actions in local regulatory jurisdictions that
call for  price decreases,  refunds or  both.  In one  such instance,  the  Utah
Supreme Court has remanded a Utah Public Service Commission ("PSC") order to the
PSC for reconsideration, thereby establishing two exceptions to the rule against
retroactive   ratemaking:  1)  unforeseen  and   extraordinary  events,  and  2)
misconduct. The PSC's initial order  denied a refund request from  interexchange
carriers and other parties related to the Tax Reform Act of 1986. This action is
still  in the discovery process.  If a formal filing  -- made in accordance with
the remand from  the Supreme  Court -- alleges  that the  exceptions apply,  the
range of possible risk is $0 to $150.
 
UNION CONTRACT
 
    On  October 2, 1995, union members approved a new three-year contract with U
S WEST. The contract  provides for salary increases  of 10.6 percent over  three
years  effective January  1 of each  year. The contract  also provides employees
with a lump sum payment of $1,500  in lieu of wage increases becoming  effective
in  August of each year. This lump sum payment is being recognized over the life
of the  contract.  The  agreement  covers  approximately  30,000  Communications
Workers of America members who work for the Communications Group.

                     NOTES TO COMBINED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
              FOR THE YEARS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 1995, 1994 AND 1993
                (DOLLARS IN MILLIONS, EXCEPT PER SHARE AMOUNTS)
 
NOTE 1: RECAPITALIZATION PLAN
    On  October  31,  1995, the  shareholders  of  U S  WEST,  Inc.,  a Colorado
corporation  ("U  S  WEST   Colorado"),  voted  to   approve  a  proposal   (the
"Recapitalization  Plan") adopted by  the Board of  Directors of U  S WEST, Inc.
(the "Board") to  reincorporate in  Delaware and  create two  classes of  common
stock   that  are  intended  to  reflect   separately  the  performance  of  the
communications and  multimedia  businesses.  Under  the  Recapitalization  Plan,
shareholders  approved an Agreement and Plan of Merger between U S WEST Colorado
and U S WEST, Inc., a Delaware  corporation ("U S WEST" or "Company"),  pursuant
to which U S WEST continues as the surviving corporation. In connection with the
merger,  the  Certificate of  Incorporation of  U  S WEST  has been  amended and
restated to designate  two classes of  common stock of  U S WEST,  one class  of
which   is  authorized   as  U   S  WEST   Communications  Group   Common  Stock
("Communications Stock"), and the  other class which is  authorized as U S  WEST
Media Group Common Stock ("Media Stock"). Effective November 1, 1995, each share
of  common stock  of U  S WEST  Colorado was  converted into  one share  each of
Communications Stock and Media Stock.
 
    The Communications  Stock  and Media  Stock  provide shareholders  with  two
distinct  securities that are intended  to reflect separately the communications
businesses  of  U  S  WEST  (the  "Communications  Group")  and  the  multimedia
businesses  of U S WEST (the "Media Group" and, together with the Communications
Group, the "Groups").
 
    The Communications Group is comprised of U S WEST Communications, Inc. ("U S
WEST Communications"), U S WEST Communications Services, Inc., U S WEST  Federal
Services,  Inc., U  S WEST  Advanced Technologies,  Inc. and  U S  WEST Business
Resources,  Inc.   The  Communications   Group  primarily   provides   regulated
communications  services  to  more  than  25  million  residential  and business
customers within a 14 state region.
 
    The Media Group is  comprised of U S  WEST Marketing Resources Group,  Inc.,
which  publishes  White and  Yellow  Pages telephone  directories,  and provides
directory and  information  services, U  S  WEST NewVector  Group,  Inc.,  which
provides  communications  and information  products  and services  over wireless
networks, U S WEST  Multimedia Communications, Inc.,  which owns domestic  cable
television  operations  and investments,  and U  S WEST  International Holdings,
Inc.,  which   primarily   owns   investments   in   international   cable   and
telecommunications, wireless communications and directory publishing operations.
 
NOTE 2: SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES
    BASIS  OF  PRESENTATION   The Combined  Financial  Statements of  the Groups
comprise  all  of  the  accounts  included  in  the  corresponding  Consolidated
Financial  Statements  of  U S  WEST.  Investments in  less  than majority-owned
ventures are generally accounted for using the equity method. The separate Group
Combined Financial  Statements have  been prepared  on a  basis that  management
believes  to  be  reasonable  and  appropriate  and  include:  (i)  the combined
historical  balance  sheets,  results  of  operations  and  cash  flows  of  the
businesses  that comprise each  of the Groups,  with all significant intra-group
amounts and  transactions eliminated;  (ii) in  the case  of the  Communications
Group Combined Financial Statements, certain corporate assets and liabilities of
U  S WEST  and related  transactions identified  with the  Communications Group;
(iii) in the case  of the Media Group  Combined Financial Statements, all  other
corporate  assets and liabilities and related transactions of U S WEST; and (iv)
an allocated portion of the corporate expense of U S WEST. Transactions  between
the Communications Group and the Media Group have not been eliminated.
 
    Notwithstanding   the  allocation  of   assets  and  liabilities  (including
contingent liabilities)  and  stockholders' equity  between  the  Communications
Group  and the Media Group for the purpose of preparing the respective financial
statements of such Group,  holders of Communications Stock  and Media Stock  are
subject  to risks associated with an investment in a single company and all of U
S WEST's  businesses, assets  and  liabilities. Such  allocation of  assets  and
liabilities   and   change  in   the  equity   structure  of   U  S   WEST  does

NOTE 2: SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (CONTINUED)
not result  in a  distribution or  spin-off  to shareholders  of any  assets  or
liabilities  of  U  S  WEST  or any  of  its  subsidiaries  or  otherwise affect
responsibility for  the liabilities  of U  S  WEST or  such subsidiaries.  As  a
result,  the rights of the holders of U  S WEST or any of its subsidiaries' debt
are not affected. Financial  effects arising from either  Group that affect U  S
WEST's  results  of operations  or  financial condition  could,  if significant,
affect the results of operations or financial position of the other Group or the
market price of the class of common  stock relating to the other Group. Any  net
losses  of  the  Communications  Group  or the  Media  Group,  and  dividends or
distributions on,  or  repurchases  of  Communications  Stock,  Media  Stock  or
preferred stock, will reduce the funds of U S WEST legally available for payment
of  dividends on both the Communications Stock and Media Stock. Accordingly, the
Communications Group Combined Financial Statements should be read in conjunction
with U S WEST's Consolidated Financial  Statements and the Media Group  Combined
Financial Statements.
 
    The  accounting policies described  herein applicable to  the preparation of
the Combined Financial Statements of the Communications Group may be modified or
rescinded  at  the  sole  discretion  of  the  Board  without  approval  of  the
stockholders,  although there is  no present intention  to do so.  The Board may
also adopt additional policies depending on the circumstances. Any determination
of the Board to modify or rescind such policies, or to add additional  policies,
including  any  decision  that  would have  disparate  impacts  upon  holders of
Communications Stock and Media Stock, would be  made by the Board in good  faith
and  in the honest belief that such decision is in the best interests of all U S
WEST stockholders, including the holders of Communications Stock and the holders
of Media  Stock. In  making  such determination,  the  Board may  also  consider
regulatory requirements imposed on U S WEST Communications by the public utility
commissions  of  various states  and the  Federal Communications  Commission. In
addition, generally accepted  accounting principles require  that any change  in
accounting  policy be  preferable (in  accordance with  such principles)  to the
policy previously established.
 
    Certain reclassifications within the Combined Financial Statements have been
made to conform to the current year presentation.
 
    ALLOCATION OF SHARED SERVICES  Certain costs relating to U S WEST's  general
and administrative services (including certain executive management, legal, tax,
accounting   and  auditing,  treasury,  strategic  planning  and  public  policy
services) are  directly assigned  by U  S WEST  to each  Group based  on  actual
utilization or are allocated based on each Group's operating expenses, number of
employees,  external revenues, average  capital and/or average  equity. U S WEST
charges each Group for such services at fully distributed cost. These direct and
indirect  allocations  were  $116,  $110  and  $117  in  1995,  1994  and  1993,
respectively. In 1995, the direct allocations comprised approximately 37 percent
of the total shared corporate services allocated to the Communications Group. It
is not practicable to provide a detailed estimate of the expenses which would be
recognized if the Communications Group was a separate legal entity. However, U S
WEST  believes that  under the Recapitalization  Plan, each  Group benefits from
synergies with the other, including having  lower operating costs than might  be
incurred if each Group was a separate legal entity.
 
    ALLOCATION OF INCOME TAXES  Federal, state and local income taxes, which are
determined  on a consolidated or combined basis,  are allocated to each Group in
accordance with tax sharing agreements between U S WEST and the entities  within
the  Groups. The  allocations will  generally reflect  each Group's contribution
(positive or  negative)  to consolidated  taxable  income and  consolidated  tax
credits.  A Group will  be compensated only at  such time as,  and to the extent
that, its tax attributes are utilized by U S WEST in a combined or  consolidated
income tax filing. Federal and state tax refunds and carryforwards or carrybacks
of  tax attributes will  generally be allocated  to the group  to which such tax
attributes relate.
 
    GROUP FINANCING   Financing activities for  the nonregulated  Communications
Group  businesses and  the Media  Group, including  the issuance,  repayment and
repurchase of short-term and long-term debt, and the issuance and repurchase  of
preferred  securities are managed by U S  WEST on a centralized basis. Financing

               NOTES TO COMBINED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (CONTINUED)
 
NOTE 2: SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (CONTINUED)
activities for U S WEST  Communications are separately identified and  accounted
for in U S WEST's records and U S WEST Communications conducts its own borrowing
activities.  Debt incurred and investments made by U S WEST and its subsidiaries
on behalf  of the  nonregulated  Communications Group  businesses and  all  debt
incurred  and  investments  made by  U  S WEST  Communications  are specifically
allocated to and  reflected on  the financial statements  of the  Communications
Group.  All debt incurred and investments made  by U S WEST and its subsidiaries
on behalf of the Media Group are specifically allocated to and reflected on  the
financial  statements  of  the Media  Group.  Debt incurred  by  U S  WEST  or a
subsidiary on behalf of a Group is  charged to such Group at the borrowing  rate
of U S WEST or such subsidiary.
 
    As of November 1, 1995, the effective date of the Recapitalization Plan, U S
WEST  does not intend to  transfer funds between the  Groups, except for certain
short-term, ordinary course advances of funds at market rates associated with  U
S  WEST's centralized cash  management program for  the nonregulated businesses.
Such short-term transfers  of funds will  be accounted for  as short-term  loans
between  the  Groups bearing  interest at  the market  rate at  which management
determines the borrowing Group could obtain funds on a short-term basis. If  the
Board,  in its sole discretion, determines that  a transfer of funds between the
Groups should be accounted  for as a long-term  loan, the Board would  establish
the  terms  on which  such  loan would  be  made, including  the  interest rate,
amortization schedule, maturity and redemption terms. Such terms would generally
reflect the then prevailing  terms upon which  management determines such  Group
could  borrow funds on a similar basis.  The financial statements of the lending
Group will be credited, and the financial statements of the borrowing Group will
be charged, with the amount of any such loan, as well as with periodic  interest
accruing  thereon. The  Board may  determine that a  transfer of  funds from the
Communications Group to  the Media Group  should be accounted  for as an  equity
contribution,  in which  case an inter-group  interest (determined  by the Board
based on the then current market value of shares of Media Stock) will either  be
created  or  increased, as  applicable.  Similarly, if  an  inter-group interest
exists, the Board may determine that a transfer of funds from the Media Group to
the Communications  Group  should  be  accounted  for  as  a  reduction  in  the
inter-group interest.
 
    DIVIDENDS    Dividends  on the  Communications  Stock  will be  paid  at the
discretion of the Board based primarily upon the financial condition, results of
operations and business requirements of the Communications Group and U S WEST as
a whole. Dividends will  be payable out of  the lesser of: 1)  the funds of U  S
WEST  legally available for the payment  of dividends; and 2) the Communications
Group Available Dividend Amount.
 
    The Communications Group Available Dividend  Amount on any date, shall  mean
the  excess, if any,  of: 1) the  amount equal to  the fair market  value of the
total assets attributed to the Communications Group less the total amount of the
liabilities attributed  to the  Communications  Group (provided  that  preferred
stock  shall not be  treated as a liability),  in each case as  of such date and
determined  on  a  basis  consistent  with  that  applied  in  determining   the
Communications Group net earnings (loss) over; 2) the aggregate par value of, or
any  greater  amount determined  to be  capital in  respect of,  all outstanding
shares of  Communications Stock  and each  class or  series of  preferred  stock
attributed to the Communications Group.
 
    EARNINGS  PER COMMON SHARE  Earnings per common share for 1995 and 1994 have
been presented on a pro forma basis to reflect the Communications Stock as if it
had  been  outstanding  since  January  1,  1994.  For  periods  prior  to   the
recapitalization,  the average common shares outstanding are assumed to be equal
to the average common shares outstanding for U S WEST.
 
    INDUSTRY SEGMENT  The businesses comprising the Communications Group operate
in a single  industry segment as  defined in Statement  of Financial  Accounting
Standards  ("SFAS")  No. 14,  "Financial Reporting  for  Segments of  a Business
Enterprise."   The   Communications    Group   primarily   provides    regulated
communications  services  to  more  than  25  million  residential  and business
customers in the Communications Group region (the "Region"). The Region includes
the states of Arizona, Colorado, Idaho, Iowa, Minnesota,

NOTE 2: SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (CONTINUED)
Montana, Nebraska,  New  Mexico,  North  Dakota,  Oregon,  South  Dakota,  Utah,
Washington  and Wyoming.  Services offered  by the  Communications Group include
local telephone services, exchange access  services (which connect customers  to
the  facilities  of  carriers, including  long-distance  providers  and wireless
operators), and long-distance services within  Local Access and Transport  Areas
("LATAs")  in the Region.  The Communications Group  provides other products and
services, including  custom  calling, voice  messaging,  caller  identification,
high-speed   data   applications,  customer   premises  equipment   and  certain
communications services  to business  customers and  governmental agencies  both
inside and outside the Region.
 
    Approximately  97 percent  of the revenues  of the  Communications Group are
attributable  to  the  operations   of  U  S   WEST  Communications,  of   which
approximately  59  percent are  derived from  the  states of  Arizona, Colorado,
Minnesota and Washington.
 
    SIGNIFICANT CONCENTRATIONS  The largest volume of the Communications Group's
services are provided to AT&T. During  1995, 1994 and 1993, revenues related  to
those  services provided to  AT&T were $1,085,  $1,130 and $1,159, respectively.
Related accounts receivable at December 31, 1995 and 1994, totaled $91 and  $98,
respectively.  As of December 31, 1995, the Communications Group is not aware of
any other significant  concentration of  business transacted  with a  particular
customer, supplier or lender that could, if suddenly eliminated, severely impact
operations.
 
    USE OF ESTIMATES  The preparation of financial statements in conformity with
generally  accepted accounting principles requires  management to make estimates
and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and
accompanying notes. Actual results could differ from those estimates.
 
    CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS  Cash  and cash equivalents include highly  liquid
investments  with original maturities  of three months or  less that are readily
convertible into cash and are not subject to significant risk from  fluctuations
in interest rates.
 
    INVENTORIES   AND  SUPPLIES    New  and  reusable  materials  of  U  S  WEST
Communications are carried  at average cost,  except for significant  individual
items  that are valued based on  specific costs. Nonreusable material is carried
at its  estimated  salvage  value. Inventories  of  the  Communications  Group's
nontelephone  operations  are  carried at  the  lower  of cost  or  market  on a
first-in, first-out basis.
 
    PROPERTY, PLANT  AND  EQUIPMENT    The investment  in  property,  plant  and
equipment   is  carried  at  cost,  less  accumulated  depreciation.  Additions,
replacements and  substantial  betterments  are capitalized.  Costs  for  normal
repair  and  maintenance  of  property,  plant  and  equipment  are  expensed as
incurred.
 
    U S WEST Communications' provision  for depreciation of property, plant  and
equipment is based on various straight-line group methods using remaining useful
(economic) lives based on industry-wide studies. In third quarter 1993, U S WEST
Communications  discontinued accounting  for its  regulated telephone operations
under SFAS No. 71, "Accounting for the Effects of Certain Types of  Regulation."
(See  Note 5 to the Combined  Financial Statements.) Prior to discontinuing SFAS
No. 71, depreciation was based on lives specified by regulators.
 
    When  the  depreciable   property,  plant   and  equipment  of   U  S   WEST
Communications  is retired or sold, the original cost less the net salvage value
is generally charged to accumulated depreciation. The nontelephone operations of
the Communications  Group  provide  for  depreciation  using  the  straight-line
method.  When such depreciable property, plant and equipment is retired or sold,
the resulting gain or loss is included in income.

               NOTES TO COMBINED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (CONTINUED)
 
NOTE 2: SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (CONTINUED)
    Interest related  to qualifying  construction  projects is  capitalized  and
reflected  as a reduction of interest expense. At U S WEST Communications, prior
to discontinuing SFAS No. 71, capitalized interest was included as an element of
other income. Amounts capitalized by the Communications Group were $39, $36  and
$15 in 1995, 1994 and 1993, respectively.
 
    REVENUE  RECOGNITION  Local telephone  service revenues are generally billed
monthly, in  advance,  and revenues  are  recognized the  following  month  when
services  are provided. Revenues derived  from exchange access and long-distance
services are billed and recorded monthly as services are provided.
 
    FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS  Net interest received or paid on interest rate  swaps
is  recognized over the life of the  swaps as an adjustment to interest expense.
Gains and  losses  on  forward  contracts are  deferred  and  recognized  as  an
adjustment  to interest expense  over the life of  the underlying debt. Currency
swaps entered  into  to convert  foreign  debt to  dollar-denominated  debt  are
combined  with the  foreign currency  debt and  accounted for  as if fixed-rate,
dollar-denominated debt were issued directly.
 
    COMPUTER SOFTWARE   The  cost  of computer  software, whether  purchased  or
developed  internally,  is  charged  to  expense  with  two  exceptions. Initial
operating systems software  is capitalized and  amortized over the  life of  the
related  hardware, and initial network  applications software is capitalized and
amortized over  three years.  Subsequent upgrades  to capitalized  software  are
expensed.  Capitalized computer software  of $183 and $146  at December 31, 1995
and  1994,  respectively,  is  recorded   in  property,  plant  and   equipment.
Amortization  of capitalized computer software costs totaled $69, $61 and $37 in
1995, 1994 and 1993, respectively.
 
    INCOME TAXES  The provision for income taxes consists of an amount for taxes
currently payable and an amount for tax consequences deferred to future  periods
in  accordance with SFAS No. 109.  The Communications Group implemented SFAS No.
109, "Accounting for Income  Taxes," in 1993. Adoption  of the new standard  did
not  have a material effect on the  financial position or results of operations,
primarily because of U S WEST's earlier adoption of SFAS No. 96.
 
    For financial  statement  purposes,  investment  tax credits  of  U  S  WEST
Communications  are  being  amortized over  the  economic lives  of  the related
property, plant  and  equipment  in  accordance  with  the  deferred  method  of
accounting for such credits.
 
    NEW  ACCOUNTING  STANDARDS   In  1996, U  S WEST  will  adopt SFAS  No. 121,
"Accounting for the Impairment of Long-Lived Assets and for Long-Lived Assets to
be Disposed Of."  SFAS No. 121  requires that long-lived  assets and  associated
intangibles  be  written  down  to  fair  value  whenever  an  impairment review
indicates that the carrying  value cannot be recovered  on an undiscounted  cash
flow  basis.  SFAS  No.  121  also requires  that  a  company  no  longer record
depreciation expense on assets held for sale. U S WEST expects that the adoption
of SFAS No. 121  will not have  a material effect on  its financial position  or
results of operations.
 
    In  1996, U  S WEST  will adopt  SFAS No.  123, "Accounting  for Stock-Based
Compensation." This standard establishes a fair value method for accounting  for
stock-based  compensation plans  either through  recognition or  disclosure. U S
WEST  will  adopt   this  standard  through   compliance  with  the   disclosure
requirements  set forth in SFAS  No. 123. Adoption of  the standard will have no
impact on the financial position or results of operations of U S WEST.

NOTE 3: RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS
 
    CUSTOMER LISTS, BILLING  AND COLLECTION SERVICES,  AND OTHER SERVICES   U  S
WEST  Communications sells customer lists,  billing and collection services, and
other services to the domestic publishing  operations of the Media Group.  These
data  and  services  are  sold  at market  price.  However,  the  accounting and
reporting for regulatory purposes is in accordance with regulatory requirements.
U S WEST Communications  charged $20, $29  and $26 for  these services in  1995,
1994 and 1993, respectively.
 
    TELECOMMUNICATIONS    SERVICES       U    S   WEST    Communications   sells
telecommunications network access and usage to the domestic cellular  operations
of  the Media Group. U  S WEST Communications charged $40,  $30 and $24 in 1995,
1994 and 1993, respectively, for these services.
 
    BELL  COMMUNICATIONS  RESEARCH,  INC.  ("BELLCORE")    Charges  relating  to
research,  development  and maintenance  of  existing technologies  performed by
Bellcore, of which U S WEST Communications has a one-seventh ownership interest,
were $84, $111 and $113 in 1995, 1994 and 1993, respectively.
 
NOTE 4: RESTRUCTURING CHARGE
    The Communications  Group's 1993  results  reflected an  $880  restructuring
charge  (pretax). The related  restructuring plan (the  "Restructuring Plan") is
designed to provide faster, more responsive customer services while reducing the
costs of  providing these  services.  As part  of  the Restructuring  Plan,  the
Communications Group is developing new systems and enhanced system functionality
that  will  enable  it  to  monitor  networks  to  reduce  the  risk  of service
interruptions, activate telephone service on demand, rapidly design and engineer
new products and services for customers, and centralize its service centers. The
Communications Group has consolidated its  560 customer service centers into  26
centers  in 10  cities and  plans on  reducing its  work force  by approximately
10,000 employees. Approximately 1,000 employees that were originally expected to
relocate have chosen separation or other job assignments and have been replaced.
This increased the  number of  employee separations  to 10,000  from 9,000,  and
increased  the estimated total  cost for employee  separations to $311, compared
with $281  in  the  original  estimate.  The  $30  cost  associated  with  these
additional  employee separations was reclassified from relocation to the reserve
for employee separations during 1995.
 
    Following is a  schedule of  the costs  included in  the 1993  restructuring
charge:

systems and the application of enhanced system functionality to existing  single
purpose  systems to provide integrated  end-to-end customer service. Real estate
costs include preparation costs for the new service centers. The relocation  and
retraining  costs are related to moving employees to the new service centers and
retraining  employees  on  the  methods   and  systems  required  in  the   new,
restructured mode of operation.

    The  Restructuring Plan is expected to be substantially completed by the end
of 1997. Implementation of the Restructuring Plan has been impacted by growth in
the business and related service  issues, new business opportunities,  revisions
to  system  delivery  schedules  and productivity  issues  caused  by  the major
rearrangement of resources due to  restructuring. These issues will continue  to
affect the timing of employee separations.

NOTE 5: PROPERTY, PLANT AND EQUIPMENT (CONTINUED)
    In 1995, U S WEST Communications sold certain rural telephone exchanges with
a  cost basis of  $258. U S  WEST Communications received  consideration for the
sales of $388, including  $214 in cash.  In 1994, U  S WEST Communications  sold
certain  rural  telephone  exchanges with  a  cost  basis of  $122  and received
consideration of $204, including $93 in cash.
 
DISCONTINUANCE OF SFAS NO. 71
 
    U S WEST  Communications incurred  a noncash, extraordinary  charge of  $3.1
billion,  net of an income tax benefit  of $2.3 billion, in conjunction with its
decision to discontinue accounting for the operations of U S WEST Communications
in accordance with SFAS No. 71, "Accounting for the Effects of Certain Types  of
Regulation,"  as  of  September  30,  1993. SFAS  No.  71  generally  applies to
regulated companies that meet certain requirements, including a requirement that
a company be able to recover its costs, notwithstanding competition, by charging
its customers at prices established by its regulators. U S WEST  Communications'
decision  to discontinue application of SFAS No. 71 was based on the belief that
competition, market  conditions and  technological  advances, more  than  prices
established  by regulators, will determine the future  cost recovery by U S WEST
Communications. As a result  of this change,  the remaining asset  lives of U  S
WEST  Communications' plant  were shortened to  more closely  reflect the useful
(economic) lives of such plant.
 
    Following is a list of the major categories of telephone property, plant and
equipment and  the  manner in  which  depreciable  lives were  affected  by  the
discontinuance of SFAS No. 71:

    U  S WEST Communications employed two methods to determine the amount of the
extraordinary charge. The "economic life" method  assumed that a portion of  the
plant-related   effect  is   a  regulatory  asset   that  was   created  by  the
under-depreciation  of  plant   under  regulation.  This   method  yielded   the
plant-related  adjustment that was confirmed by  the second method, a discounted
cash flows analysis.
 
    Following is a schedule  of the nature and  amounts of the after-tax  charge
recognized  as a result of  U S WEST Communications'  discontinuance of SFAS No.

    U  S WEST and U S WEST  Communications maintain commercial paper programs to
finance short-term cash flow requirements, as well as to maintain a presence  in
the short-term debt market. In addition, U S WEST Communications, which conducts
its own borrowing activities, is permitted to borrow up to $600 under short-term
lines  of credit, all  of which was  available at December  31, 1995. Additional
lines of credit aggregating approximately $1.3 billion are available to both the
Media Group and  the nonregulated  subsidiaries of the  Communications Group  in
accordance with their borrowing needs.

    Long-term  debt consists  principally of  debentures, medium-term  notes and
zero coupon subordinated  notes convertible  at any  time into  equal shares  of
Communications  Stock and  Media Stock.  The zero coupon  notes have  a yield to
maturity of approximately 7.3 percent. The  zero coupon notes are recorded at  a
discounted value of $276 and $264 at December 31, 1995 and 1994, respectively.
 
    During  1995, U S WEST Communications  refinanced $1.5 billion of commercial
paper to take advantage  of favorable long-term interest  rates. In addition  to
the commercial paper, U S WEST Communications refinanced $145 of long-term debt.
Expenses   associated  with  the  refinancing  of  long-term  debt  resulted  in
extraordinary charges to income of $8, net of tax benefits of $5.
 
    During 1993,  U  S  WEST Communications  refinanced  long-term  debt  issues
aggregating  $2.7  billion in  principal  amount. Expenses  associated  with the
refinancing resulted in an extraordinary charge to  income of $77, net of a  tax
benefit of $48.

NOTE 6: DEBT (CONTINUED)
    Interest  payments by the Communications  Group, net of amounts capitalized,

INTEREST RATE RISK MANAGEMENT
 
    U S  WEST  Communications  enters  into interest  rate  swap  agreements  to
effectively  convert existing commercial paper to fixed-rate debt. This allows U
S WEST Communications to achieve  interest savings over issuing fixed-rate  debt
directly.
 
    Under  an interest  rate swap, U  S WEST Communications  agrees with another
party to exchange interest payments at specified intervals over a defined  term.
Interest  payments are calculated  by reference to the  notional amount based on
the fixed- and  variable-rate terms  of the  swap agreements.  The net  interest
received  or paid  as part  of the  interest rate  swap is  accounted for  as an
adjustment to interest expense.
 
    During 1995 and 1994, U S WEST Communications entered into currency swaps to
convert Swiss franc-denominated debt to dollar-denominated debt. This allowed  U
S  WEST  Communications to  achieve  interest savings  over  issuing fixed-rate,
dollar-denominated debt.  The  currency  swap  and  foreign  currency  debt  are
combined and accounted for as if fixed-rate, dollar-denominated debt were issued
directly.
 
    The  following  table  summarizes terms  of  swaps  pertaining to  U  S WEST
Communications as of December 31, 1995  and 1994. Variable rates are indexed  to
two- and ten-year constant maturity Treasury and 30-day commercial paper rates.

    In  1993, U  S WEST Communications  executed forward contracts  to sell U.S.
Treasury bonds to lock in  the U.S. Treasury rate  component of the future  debt
issue.  At December 31, 1995, deferred credits of $8 and deferred charges of $51
on closed forward contracts are  included as part of  the carrying value of  the
underlying  debt. The  deferred credits  and charges  are being  recognized as a
yield adjustment  over the  life of  the debt,  which matures  at various  dates
through  2043. The net  deferred charge is  directly offset by  the lower coupon
rate achieved on the  debt issuance. At  December 31, 1995,  there were no  open
forward contracts.
 
    The  counterparties  to these  interest rate  contracts are  major financial
institutions. U S WEST Communications is exposed to credit loss in the event  of
nonperformance  by  these  counterparties. U  S  WEST manages  this  exposure by
monitoring the credit standing of  the counterparty and establishing dollar  and
term  limitations  which  correspond to  the  respective credit  rating  of each
counterparty. U S WEST Communications does  not have significant exposure to  an
individual   counterparty  and   does  not  anticipate   nonperformance  by  any
counterparty.
 
NOTE 7: FAIR VALUES OF FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS
 
    Fair values  of  cash  equivalents, other  current  amounts  receivable  and
payable, and short-term debt approximate carrying values due to their short-term
nature.
 
    The  fair values of interest  rate swaps are based  on estimated amounts U S
WEST Communications would  receive or  pay to terminate  such agreements  taking
into account current interest rates and creditworthiness of the counterparties.

are covered by  the plan. U  S WEST  matches a percentage  of eligible  employee
contributions  with  shares  of  Communications  Stock  and/or  Media  Stock  in
accordance with participant elections. Participants may also elect to reallocate
past Company  contributions between  Communications Stock  and Media  Stock.  In
1989,  U S  WEST established  two LESOPS to  provide Company  stock for matching
contributions to the savings plan. Shares in the LESOP are released as principal

interest are paid on the debt. At  December 31, 1995, 10,145,485 shares each  of
Communications  Stock and Media  Stock had been allocated  from the LESOP, while
2,839,435  shares  each  of  Communications  Stock  and  Media  Stock   remained
unallocated.
 
    The   borrowings  associated  with  the  LESOP,  which  are  unconditionally
guaranteed by U  S WEST,  are reflected in  the Media  Group Combined  Financial
Statements.  Contributions from the Communications Group and the Media Group, as
well as dividends on unallocated  shares held by the LESOP  ($8, $11 and $14  in
1995,  1994 and 1993,  respectively), are used for  debt service. Beginning with
the dividend  paid in  fourth-quarter 1995,  dividends on  allocated shares  are
being  paid annually to participants.  Previously, dividends on allocated shares
were used for debt  service with participants  receiving additional shares  from
the  LESOP. Tax benefits related to dividend  payments on eligible shares in the
savings plan have  been allocated to  the Communications Group,  which paid  the
dividends.
 
    U S WEST recognizes expense based on the cash payments method. Contributions
to  the plan related to the Communications Group, excluding dividends, were $70,
$68 and $68 in  1995, 1994 and  1993, respectively, of which  $12, $16 and  $20,
respectively, have been classified as interest expense.
 
NOTE 10: STOCK INCENTIVE PLANS
    U  S WEST maintains stock incentive  plans for executives and key employees,
and nonemployees.  The Amended  1994 Stock  Plan (the  "Plan") was  approved  by
shareowners  on October 31,  1995 in connection  with the Recapitalization Plan.
The Plan is a successor plan to the U S WEST, Inc. Stock Incentive Plan and  the
U  S WEST 1991 Stock Incentive Plan (the "Predecessor Plans"). No further grants
of options or restricted stock may be made under the Predecessor Plans. The Plan
is administered by the Human Resources Committee of the board of directors  with
respect  to officers, executive officers and  outside directors and by a special
committee  with  respect   to  all   other  eligible   employees  and   eligible
nonemployees.
 
    During  calendar year 1995,  up to 2,200,000  shares of Communications Stock
were  available  for  grant.   The  maximum  aggregate   number  of  shares   of
Communications  Stock that  may be  granted in any  other calendar  year for all
purposes under the  Plan is  nine-tenths of one  percent (0.90  percent) of  the
shares  of  such  class  outstanding (excluding  shares  held  in  the Company's
treasury) on the first day of such  calendar year. In the event that fewer  than
the  full aggregate number of  shares of either class  available for issuance in
any calendar year are issued  in any such year, the  shares not issued shall  be
added  to the shares of such class available for issuance in any subsequent year
or years. Options  may be exercised  no later than  10 years after  the date  on
which the option was granted.

NOTE 11: EMPLOYEE BENEFITS
 
PENSION PLAN
 
    The Communications  Group and  the Media  Group participate  in the  defined
benefit  pension plan  sponsored by U  S WEST. Substantially  all management and
occupational employees  of the  Communications Group  are covered  by the  plan.
Since  plan assets  are not segregated  into separate accounts  or restricted to
providing benefits to employees of the Communications Group, assets of the  plan
may  be used to provide  benefits to employees of  both the Communications Group
and the Media Group. In the event the single employer pension plan sponsored  by
U  S WEST would be separated into two  or more plans, guidelines in the Internal
Revenue Code dictate how assets of the plan must be allocated to the new  plans.
U S WEST currently has no intention to split the plan. Because of these factors,
U  S WEST believes there is no reasonable  basis to attribute plan assets to the
Communications  Group  as  if  they  had  funded  separately  their  actuarially
determined obligation.

NOTE 11: EMPLOYEE BENEFITS (CONTINUED)
    Management  benefits are  based on  a final  pay formula  while occupational
benefits are based on a flat benefit  formula. U S WEST uses the projected  unit
credit  method for  the determination  of pension  cost for  financial reporting
purposes and the aggregate cost method  for funding purposes. U S WEST's  policy
is to fund amounts required under the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of
1974 ("ERISA") and no funding was required in 1995, 1994 or 1993. Should funding
be   required  in  the  future,  funding  amounts  would  be  allocated  to  the
Communications Group based upon the ratio of service cost of the  Communications
Group to total service cost of plan participants.
 
    The composition of the net pension cost and the actuarial assumptions of the
plan follow:

    ALLOCATION  OF PENSION COSTS  U S  WEST's allocation policy is to: 1) offset
the Company-wide service cost, interest cost  and amortization by the return  on
plan   assets;  and  2)   allocate  the  remaining  net   pension  cost  to  the
Communications Group based on the  ratio of actuarially determined service  cost
of the Communications Group to total service cost of plan participants. U S WEST
believes  allocating net pension cost based  on service cost is reasonable since
service  cost   is  a   primary  factor   in  determining   pension  cost.   Net

NOTE 11: EMPLOYEE BENEFITS (CONTINUED)
pension  costs allocated to the Communications Group  were $(2), $0 and $(71) in
1995, 1994 and 1993, respectively. The  service and interest costs for 1995  and
the  projected  benefit  obligation  at  December  31,  1995  attributed  to the
Communications Group were $149, $529 and $8,021, respectively.
 
POSTRETIREMENT BENEFITS OTHER THAN PENSIONS
 
    The Communications Group and the Media Group participate in plans  sponsored
by  U S WEST  which provide certain  health care and  life insurance benefits to
retired employees. In conjunction with the  Company's 1992 adoption of SFAS  No.
106,  "Employers' Accounting for Postretirement Benefits Other Than Pensions," U
S WEST elected to immediately  recognize the accumulated postretirement  benefit
obligation  for current and future retirees. However, the Federal Communications
Commission and certain state jurisdictions permit amortization of the transition
obligation over the  average remaining  service period of  active employees  for
regulatory  accounting purposes with  most jurisdictions requiring  funding as a
stipulation for rate recovery.
 
    U S WEST  uses the  projected unit credit  method for  the determination  of
postretirement  medical  and life  costs for  financial reporting  purposes. The
composition of  net  postretirement  benefit  costs  and  actuarial  assumptions

</TABLE>
 
- ------------------------------
* Medical cost trend rate gradually declines to an ultimate rate of 5 percent in
  2011.
 
    A one-percent increase in the assumed  health care cost trend rate for  each
future  year would have increased the aggregate of the service and interest cost
components of  1995 net  postretirement benefit  cost by  approximately $40  and
increased   the   1995   accumulated   postretirement   benefit   obligation  by
approximately $350.
 
    Anticipated  future   benefit  changes   have   been  reflected   in   these
postretirement benefit calculations.
 
    PLAN ASSETS  Assets of the postretirement medical and life plans may be used
to  provide benefits to employees of both the Communications Group and the Media
Group since plan  assets are  not legally  restricted to  providing benefits  to
either  Group. In  the event  that either plan  sponsored by  U S  WEST would be
separated into  two or  more plans,  there  are no  guidelines in  the  Internal
Revenue  Code for allocating assets  of the plan. U  S WEST allocates the assets
based on historical contributions for  postretirement medical costs, and on  the
ratio  of  salaries  for life  plan  participants.  U S  WEST  currently  has no
intention to split the plans.
 
    POSTRETIREMENT MEDICAL COSTS   The  service and interest  components of  net
postretirement medical benefit costs are calculated for the Communications Group
based  on  the  population  characteristics  of  the  Group.  Since  funding  of
postretirement medical costs is voluntary, return on assets is attributed to the
Communications Group  based on  historical funding.  The Communications  Group's
annual  funding amount is based on its cash requirements with the funding at U S
WEST Communications based on regulatory accounting requirements.
 
    Net postretirement medical  benefit costs recognized  by the  Communications
Group  for  1995, 1994  and 1993  were  $189, $207  and $238,  respectively. The
percentage of  postretirement medical  assets attributed  to the  Communications
Group   at  December   31,  1995  and   1994,  based   on  historical  voluntary
contributions,  was   96  and   95   percent,  respectively.   The   accumulated
postretirement medical benefit obligation attributed to the Communications Group
was $3,057 at December 31, 1995.
 
    ALLOCATION  OF POSTRETIREMENT LIFE COSTS  Net postretirement life costs, and
funding requirements, if any, are allocated  to the Communications Group in  the
same manner as pensions. U S WEST will generally fund the amount allowed for tax
purposes  and no funding of postretirement life insurance occurred in 1995, 1994
and 1993. U S WEST believes  its method of allocating postretirement life  costs
is reasonable.
 
    Net  postretirement life benefit costs allocated to the Communications Group
for 1995, 1994  and 1993 were  $0, $19  and $14, respectively.  The service  and
interest  costs  for  1995  and  the  accumulated  postretirement  life  benefit
obligation at December 31, 1995 attributed to the Communications Group were  $5,
$29, $425, respectively.

    The  current portion of the deferred tax asset was $259 and $300 at December
31, 1995 and 1994, respectively, resulting primarily from restructuring  charges
and compensation related items.
 
    On  August 10,  1993, federal  legislation was  enacted which  increased the
corporate tax rate from 34 percent to 35 percent retroactive to January 1, 1993.
The cumulative effect on deferred taxes of the 1993 increase in income tax rates
was $54.
 
NOTE 13: CONTINGENCIES
    At U S  WEST Communications there  are pending regulatory  actions in  local
regulatory  jurisdictions that call for price decreases, refunds or both. In one
such instance,  the  Utah Supreme  Court  has  remanded a  Utah  Public  Service
Commission  ("PSC") order to  the PSC for  reconsideration, thereby establishing
two exceptions to  the rule  against retroactive ratemaking:  1) unforeseen  and
extraordinary events, and 2) misconduct. The PSC's initial order denied a refund
request  from interexchange carriers and other parties related to the Tax Reform
Act of 1986. This action is still in the discovery process. If a formal filing -
made in accordance with  the remand from  the Supreme Court  - alleges that  the
exceptions apply, the range of possible risk to U S WEST Communications is $0 to
$150.

                             (DOLLARS IN MILLIONS)
THE RECAPITALIZATION PLAN
 
    On October  31,  1995,  the shareholders  of  U  S WEST,  Inc.,  a  Colorado
corporation   ("U  S  WEST   Colorado"),  voted  to   approve  a  proposal  (the
"Recapitalization Plan") adopted by the  Board of Directors to reincorporate  in
Delaware  and create  two classes  of common  stock. Under  the Recapitalization
Plan, shareholders approved  an agreement and  plan of merger  between U S  WEST
Colorado  and  U  S  WEST, Inc.,  a  Delaware  corporation ("U  S  WEST"  or the
"Company"), pursuant to which U S  WEST continues as the surviving  corporation.
In  connection with the merger, the Certificate of Incorporation of U S WEST has
been amended and restated to designate two classes of common stock of U S  WEST,
one  class of which is authorized as  U S WEST Communications Group Common Stock
("Communications Stock") and  the other class  which is authorized  as U S  WEST
Media Group Common Stock ("Media Stock").
 
    The  Communications  Stock and  Media  Stock provide  shareholders  with two
distinct securities that are intended  to reflect separately the  communications
businesses  of  U  S  WEST  (the  "Communications  Group")  and  the  multimedia
businesses of U S WEST (the "Media Group" and, together with the  Communications
Group, the "Groups").
 
THE MEDIA GROUP
 
    The  Media Group is  comprised of: (i)  cable and telecommunications network
businesses outside of the Communications Group Region and internationally,  (ii)
domestic  and international wireless communications network businesses and (iii)
domestic and international directory and information services businesses.
 
    On February 27,  1996, U S  WEST announced a  definitive agreement to  merge
with  Continental Cablevision,  Inc. ("Continental").  Continental, the nation's
third-largest cable operator, serves 4.2 million domestic customers, passes more
than seven  million domestic  homes  and holds  significant other  domestic  and
international  properties. U S WEST will purchase all of Continental's stock for
approximately  $5.3  billion  and  will  assume  Continental's  debt  and  other
obligations,  which amount to approximately  $5.5 billion. Consideration for the
$5.3 billion in  equity will consist  of approximately  $1 billion in  U S  WEST
preferred  stock, convertible to Media Stock; and, at U S WEST's option, between
$1 billion and $1.5 billion in cash, and $2.8 billion to $3.3 billion in  shares
of  Media  Stock. The  transaction, which  is  expected to  close in  the fourth
quarter of 1996, is subject to  a number of conditions and approvals,  including
approvals  from Continental  shareholders and  local franchising  and government
authorities.
 
    Continental's 4.2 million  domestic customers are  highly clustered in  five
large  markets -- New England, California,  Chicago, Michigan, Ohio and Florida.
Upon closing, U S WEST  will own or share management  of cable systems in 60  of
the  top  100  American  markets  and serve  nearly  one  of  every  three cable
households. In  addition,  Continental  has interests  in  cable  properties  in
Australia, Argentina and Singapore; a 10 percent interest in PRIMESTAR (a direct
broadcast  satellite  service);  telephone  access  businesses  in  Florida  and
Virginia; and interests in programming that include Turner Broadcasting  System,
E! Entertainment Television, the Golf Channel, and the Food Channel.
 
    The Media Group's cable and telecommunications businesses include U S WEST's
investment  in Time  Warner Entertainment  Company L.P.  ("TWE" or  "Time Warner
Entertainment"), the second largest provider of cable television services in the
United States, its cable systems in the Atlanta, Georgia metropolitan area ("the
Atlanta Systems"), and international  cable and telecommunications  investments,
including TeleWest plc ("TeleWest"). In 1995, TeleWest Communications plc merged
its  cable television and  telephony interests with SBC  CableComms (UK) to form
TeleWest, the largest provider of combined cable and telecommunications services
in the  United Kingdom.  The Media  Group also  owns interests  in cable  and/or
telecommunications properties in the Netherlands, Sweden, Norway, Hungary, Czech
Republic, Malaysia and Indonesia.

                    MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF
           FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (CONTINUED)
 
    The   Media  Group  provides   domestic  wireless  communications  services,
including cellular services, in  13 western and midwestern  states to a  rapidly
growing  customer base. During 1994, U S WEST signed a definitive agreement with
AirTouch Communications to combine their  domestic cellular assets. The  initial
equity ownership of this cellular joint venture will be approximately 70 percent
AirTouch  and approximately  30 percent Media  Group. The  combination will take
place in two phases. During Phase I,  which U S WEST entered effective  November
1, 1995, the two companies are operating their cellular properties separately. A
Wireless  Management  Company  (the  "WMC") has  been  formed  and  is providing
centralized services  to  both companies  on  a  contract basis.  In  Phase  II,
AirTouch and U S WEST will contribute their domestic cellular assets to the WMC.
In  this phase, the Media Group will reflect its share of the combined operating
results of the WMC using the equity method of accounting. The recent passage  of
the  Telecommunications Act of 1996  has removed significant regulatory barriers
to completion of Phase  II of the  business combination. U  S WEST expects  that
Phase II closing could take place by the end of 1996 or early 1997.
 
    U  S WEST partnered with AirTouch Communications, Bell Atlantic and NYNEX to
form a strategic  national wireless  alliance and  formed a  venture to  provide
personal  communications services ("PCS"). This  venture, PCS PrimeCo, purchased
11 licenses in the Federal  Communication Commission's (the "FCC") PCS  auction,
covering  57 million people in Chicago, Dallas, Honolulu, Houston, Jacksonville,
Miami, Milwaukee, New Orleans, Richmond, San Antonio and Tampa. The Media  Group
also  provides  wireless  communications  services  internationally  through its
Mercury One 2 One  ("One 2 One")  joint venture, the  world's first PCS  service
located  in the United Kingdom. The Media  Group also owns interests in wireless
properties in Hungary, the Czech  and Slovak Republics, Russia, Malaysia,  India
and Poland.
 
    The  Media Group's directory and information services businesses develop and
package content  and  information  services,  including  telephone  directories,
database  marketing and other interactive services in domestic and international
markets. The  Media  Group  publishes  more than  300  White  and  Yellow  Pages
directories  in 14 western and mid-western  states and nearly 200 directories in
the United Kingdom and Poland. The Media Group also has a 50 percent interest in
Listel, Brazil's largest telephone directory publisher.
 
    The Combined  Financial  Statements  of  the Media  Group  include  the  (i)
combined  historical balance sheets, results of operations and cash flows of the
businesses that  comprise  the  Media  Group;  and  (ii)  corporate  assets  and
liabilities  of  U  S WEST  and  related  transactions not  identified  with the
Communications Group; and (iii) an allocated portion of the corporate expense of
U  S  WEST.  All  significant  intra-group  financial  transactions  have   been
eliminated.  Transactions between the  Media Group and  the Communications Group
have not been eliminated. For a more complete discussion of U S WEST's corporate
allocation policies, see the U S WEST Media Group Combined Financial  Statements

    The  following discussion  is based  on the  U S  WEST Media  Group Combined
Financial Statements prepared in accordance with GAAP. The discussion should  be
read in conjunction with the U S WEST, Inc. Consolidated Financial Statements. A
discussion  of the Media Group's operations on a proportionate basis follows the
GAAP presentation in "Selected Proportionate Financial Data."

</TABLE>
 
- ------------------------------
(1)
  1995  income from continuing  operations before extraordinary  item includes a
  gain of $95 from the  merger of TeleWest with SBC  CableComms (UK) and $9  for
  costs associated with the Recapitalization Plan.
 
(2)
  1994  income from continuing  operations before extraordinary  item includes a
  gain of $105 from  the partial sale  of U S WEST's  joint venture interest  in
  TeleWest and a gain of $41 from the sale of U S WEST's paging operations.
 
(3)
  Percent  ownership represents  pro-rata priority  capital and  residual equity
  interests.
 
(4)
  Primarily includes interest  expense and divisional  expenses associated  with
  equity investments.
 
(5)
  Earnings  per common share have been presented on  a pro forma basis as if the
  Media Stock had been outstanding since  January 1, 1994. For periods prior  to
  the  recapitalization, the average common shares outstanding are assumed to be
  equal to the average common shares outstanding for U S WEST, Inc.
 
    During 1995,  income from  continuing operations  before extraordinary  item
declined  55  percent,  to $59,  excluding  the  effects of  the  one-time items
described in Notes 1 and 2 to the  table above. The decline is due primarily  to
higher  equity losses related to  international growth initiatives and increased
amortization and interest  expense. Interest  expense increases  relate to  debt
issued  in  connection with  the Atlanta  Systems  acquisition and  expansion of
international investments. The declines were partially offset by improvement  in
the domestic cellular and Yellow Pages operations.
 
    During  1995, the Media Group incurred an extraordinary loss of $4, net of a
tax benefit of $2, related to the early retirement of debt by TWE.
 
    DIRECTORY AND INFORMATION SERVICES  Income related to Yellow Pages directory
advertising increased  10 percent  in 1995,  to $307,  due to  pricing,  product
enhancements  and the effect of improved  marketing programs on business volume.
Yellow Pages income was partially offset by net operating losses of $60  related
to   new  products  and  other  growth  initiatives,  including  development  of
interactive services.  The  Media  Group  views  new  service  offerings  as  an
important  part  of its  strategy and  expects investments  in new  products and
services in 1996 will  continue to partially offset  expected income related  to
the Yellow Pages business.
 
    Income  related to directory and information services in 1995 includes $7 in
losses related to  expansion of international  directory publishing  operations.
The international publishing operations were not significant to the 1994 results
of operations.

                    MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF
           FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (CONTINUED)
 
    WIRELESS COMMUNICATIONS  Income related to wireless communications more than
doubled,  to $62 in  1995, excluding the 1994  gain on sale  of paging assets of
$41. The increase in wireless communications income is attributable to continued
strong growth  in cellular  subscribers. The  cellular subscriber  base  reached
1,463,000 at December 31, 1995, a 51 percent increase compared with 1994.
 
    CABLE   AND  TELECOMMUNICATIONS     The  1995  loss  of   $7  in  cable  and
telecommunications  operations  is  primarily  the  result  of  amortization  of
intangible  assets  related  to the  December  1994 acquisition  of  the Atlanta
Systems. The subscriber base of the Atlanta Systems increased 6.7 percent during
the last twelve months, to 527,000 at December 31, 1995.
 
    OPERATING RESULTS OF UNCONSOLIDATED EQUITY INVESTMENTS  The net loss related
to the Media Group's interests in TWE increased in 1995, due primarily to higher
TWE financing  costs and  depreciation charges,  partially offset  by  increased
income  related to cable and programming operations. Cable subscribers served by
TWE increased almost 6 percent compared with last year, excluding the impact  of
recent cable transactions.
 
    On  September 22, 1995, U S WEST  filed a lawsuit in Delaware Chancery Court
to enjoin the proposed merger of Time  Warner and Turner Broadcasting. U S  WEST
has  alleged  breaches  of  contract  and fiduciary  duties  by  Time  Warner in
connection with this proposed merger. Time Warner filed a countersuit against  U
S  WEST on October 11, 1995,  alleging misrepresentation, breach of contract and
other misconduct on  the part of  U S  WEST. Time Warner's  countersuit seeks  a
reformation  of the  Time Warner  Entertainment partnership  agreement, an order
that enjoins U S WEST from breaching the partnership agreement, and  unspecified
compensatory  damages. U S WEST  has denied each of  the claims in Time Warner's
countersuit. The trial for this action concluded on March 22, 1996. A ruling  by
the Delaware Chancery Court is expected in June 1996.
 
    International businesses are experiencing rapid growth associated with their
early  development phases. New investments in  1995 include the acquisition of a
50 percent  interest  in  cable  television  systems  in  the  Netherlands,  the
acquisition  of a 29 percent  interest in cable television  systems in the Czech
Republic and additional capital provided to a 20 percent owned joint venture  in
Malaysia  to  provide  local  wireline and  wireless  communications.  The Czech
Republic venture  incurred significant  start-up losses  in 1995,  of which  the
Media   Group's  share  was  $13.  The   structure  of  this  venture  is  being
renegotiated.
 
    U S WEST ventures  have recently been awarded  licenses to provide  cellular
services  using digital technology in India  and Poland. The Media Group expects
losses related to international ventures will be significant in 1996.
 
    In October 1995, TeleWest completed its merger with SBC CableComms (UK). The
Media Group recognized an after-tax gain related to the merger of $95, and has a
26.8 percent interest in the combined company.
 
    Cable television  subscribers  of  TeleWest and  its  affiliates,  based  on
TeleWest's  equity interest  in affiliated  operations, increased  to 457,000 at
December 31, 1995, an increase of  44 percent compared with 1994, and  telephone
access  lines increased  93 percent during  the last twelve  months, to 527,000.
Both growth rates exclude the one-time impact of the merger.
 
    Subscribers to U S WEST's international wireless joint venture operations in
the United Kingdom, Hungary, the Czech and Slovak Republics, Russia and Malaysia
grew to 682,000 at December 31, 1995, which is almost twice the customer base at
December 31, 1994. One 2 One served  375,000 customers at December 31, 1995,  an
83 percent increase compared with 1994.
 
    Effective January 1, 1995, the capital assets segment is being accounted for
in  accordance with Staff  Accounting Bulletin No. 93,  issued by the Securities
and Exchange  Commission ("SEC"),  which  requires discontinued  operations  not
disposed  of  within  one year  of  the  measurement date  to  be  accounted for

sale. The net realizable value of the assets are reevaluated on an ongoing basis
with  adjustments to the  existing reserve, if any,  being charged to continuing
operations. No adjustment was required in 1995.

</TABLE>
 
- ------------------------------
(1)
  The paging business was sold in June 1994. Results reflect operations for  the
  six months ending June 30, 1994.
 
    Media  Group sales  and other  revenues increased  15 percent,  to $2,374 in
1995, excluding the effects of the  1994 Atlanta Systems acquisition and  paging
sale.  The  increase was  primarily  due to  strong  growth in  cellular service
revenue.
 
    DIRECTORY AND  INFORMATION  SERVICES    Revenues  related  to  Yellow  Pages
directory  advertising increased  6.4 percent, to  $1,026 in 1995,  due to price
increases of  4.5 percent,  higher revenue  per advertiser  and an  increase  in
Yellow Pages advertising volume.
 
    International directory publishing revenues increased $44 in 1995, primarily
due  to  U S  WEST's May  1994  purchase of  Thomson Directories.  The remaining
increase is due to an increase in advertisers and revenue per advertiser.
 
    WIRELESS COMMUNICATIONS  Cellular service revenues increased 34 percent,  to
$845 in 1995, due to a 51 percent increase in subscribers during the last twelve
months  (with  20 percent  of the  additions  occurring in  December), partially
offset by a  13 percent drop  in average  revenue per subscriber  to $60.00  per
month.  The increase  in subscribers relates  to continued growth  in demand for
wireless  services.  The  Media  Group  anticipates  continued  growth  in   its
subscriber base, although at slightly decreased rates.
 
    New distribution programs are being developed which increase availability of
cellular  products and simplify  the cellular service  activation process. These
programs have contributed to the shift  in the customer base from businesses  to
consumers.  This  shift, combined  with competitive  pressures on  pricing, will
cause the average revenue per subscriber to continue to decline.
 
    Cellular equipment  revenues decreased  20 percent,  to $96  in 1995,  as  a
result  of lower cellular equipment costs. These lower equipment costs are being
passed on to retailers and to new customers. The Media Group expects this  trend
to  continue  in 1996  as  the cost  of equipment  continues  to decline  and as
penetration into the consumer market increases.
 
    Revenues related to the paging sales and service operations, which were sold
in 1994, approximated $28 in 1994.

  Primarily includes divisional expenses associated with equity investments.
 
    During 1995, Media  Group operating  income increased 13  percent, to  $467,
excluding  the effects of the 1994  Atlanta Systems acquisition and paging sale.
EBITDA increased approximately 16 percent, to  $716, on a comparable basis.  The
Media  Group considers EBITDA an important indicator of the operational strength
and performance of its  businesses. The increases were  primarily due to  strong
growth in wireless communications operations.
 
    DIRECTORY AND INFORMATION SERVICES  During 1995, operating income related to
domestic  Yellow Pages directory advertising increased $40. Revenue increases of
$61 and general cost savings of  $15, including $8 associated with assuming  the
management   of  certain  data  base  services  from  the  Communications  Group
contributed to the increase. The revenue  gains and cost savings were  partially
offset  by  operating cost  increases of  $36,  primarily due  to an  11 percent
increase in  paper,  printing,  delivery and  distribution  costs.  New  product
development  activities  reduced  domestic  directory  and  information services
operating income  by $38  in 1995.  The decrease  is a  result of  higher  costs
associated  with  the  development  of new  database  marketing  and interactive
services, including a one-time charge of $8 to exit certain product lines.
 
    On October  15, 1995,  U S  WEST Direct  and the  Communications Workers  of
America  ("CWA") reached  a tentative  agreement on  their contract,  subject to
ratification by  the CWA  membership.  This contract  would provide  for  salary
increases  of 10.5 percent over  three years and provides  employees with a lump
sum payment of $850.
 
    EBITDA related  to  domestic  Yellow Pages  directory  advertising  services
increased  9 percent, to $519  in 1995. Expansion of  the business combined with
cost savings led to an EBITDA margin  related to the Yellow Pages operations  of
50.6 percent in 1995 compared with 49.4 percent in 1994.
 
    Operating  income  for  international  directory  publishing  operations was
unchanged from 1994.  The 1995  revenue gains of  $44 were  offset by  increased
operating  expenses,  primarily  associated  with the  May  1994  acquisition of
Thomson Directories and increased costs associated with business volume.
 
    WIRELESS COMMUNICATIONS  Cellular operating income increased 79 percent,  to
$147  in 1995. The increase in operating income is a result of revenue increases
associated with the rapidly expanding subscriber

base combined with efficiency gains. The 1995 decline in revenue per  subscriber
of  13 percent has  been more than offset  by decreases in  the cost incurred to
acquire a customer  ("acquisition costs") and  the cost to  maintain a  customer
("support  costs").  Support  costs  include charges  for  access  and  usage of
land-line telecommunications networks, subscriber billing, customer service  and
general  support costs, as well as costs associated with roaming, intralata toll
calls and fraud. Support costs per subscriber have declined 20 percent in  1995.
The  decline is generally a result of  the efficiencies gained from an expanding
customer base without corresponding  increases in headcount and  infrastructure.
The  acquisition cost  per subscriber  added decreased 6  percent in  1995, as a
result of the  expanding customer base  and shifts in  the distribution  channel
resulting in generally less costly subscriber additions.
 
    Cellular  EBITDA increased 49 percent during  1995, to $268. The business is
realizing operating scale efficiencies  that have resulted in  lower costs on  a
per  subscriber basis.  The efficiencies  have resulted  in an  increase in 1995
cellular service EBITDA margin to 31.7 percent from 28.4 percent in 1994.
 
    CABLE AND TELECOMMUNICATIONS  Cable and telecommunications operating  income
reflects  the  December 1994  acquisition of  the  Atlanta Systems.  The Atlanta
Systems contributed operating income of $23 and EBITDA of $100 in 1995.
 
    OTHER  Other operating  income decreased primarily  due to costs  associated
with growth in international operations.

</TABLE>
 
    Interest  expense increased  $34, or  52 percent,  primarily as  a result of
financing costs associated  with the  December 1994 acquisition  of the  Atlanta
Systems,  new domestic and  international investments and  a reclassification of
debt from net investment in assets held for sale.
 
    Equity losses increased $86 in 1995,  primarily due to costs related to  the
expansion  of  the  network  and  additional  financing  costs  at  TeleWest and
additional costs associated with the significant increase in customers at One  2
One.  Start-up  and  other costs  associated  with new  international  cable and
telecommunications investments  primarily  located  in the  Czech  Republic  and
Malaysia  contributed  to the  increase. These  increased losses  were partially
offset by  earnings  in the  European  wireless operations.  Losses  related  to
domestic  investments in  TWE and  PCS PrimeCo  also increased.  The Media Group
expects the  PCS partnership  to experience  several years  of operating  losses
associated with the start-up phase of the PCS business.
 
    Other  income  decreased  $41,  or  89 percent,  primarily  as  a  result of
increased minority  interest  expense  associated  with  the  domestic  cellular
operations,  costs associated with the Recapitalization  Plan and a 1994 gain on
sale of nonstrategic operations.

lower  pretax  income,  the  effects of  goodwill  amortization  related  to the
acquisition of the Atlanta Systems, higher  state and foreign income taxes,  and
expenses  associated with the Recapitalization Plan. Additionally, a tax benefit
was recorded in 1994 related  to the sale of  paging assets that contributed  to
the increase in the effective tax rate.

- ------------------------------
(1)
  1994 income  from continuing  operations  includes a  gain  of $105  from  the
  partial  sale of U S WEST's joint venture  interest in TeleWest, and a gain of
  $41 from the sale of U S WEST's paging operations.
 
(2)
  1993 income from continuing  operations was reduced  by $76 for  restructuring
  charges;  $31 pertaining to the directory and information services segment and
  $45 pertaining to the wireless segment.
 
(3)
  Percent ownership  represents pro-rata  priority capital  and residual  equity
  interests.
 
(4)
  Primarily  includes interest  expense and divisional  expenses associated with
  equity investments.
 
    During 1994,  income from  continuing operations  decreased 19  percent,  to
$130,  excluding the effects of the one-time items described in Notes 1 and 2 to
the table  above. The  decline in  income  is primarily  a result  of  increased
start-up  losses associated  with international businesses,  partially offset by
income growth in domestic  wireless operations attributable  to rapid growth  in
customer demand.
 
    During  1993, the  Board approved  a plan to  dispose of  the capital assets
segment, which  includes activities  related  to financial  services,  financial
guarantee  insurance  operations and  real estate.  Until  January 1,  1995, the
capital  assets  segment  was  accounted  for  as  discontinued  operations   in
accordance  with Accounting Principles Board Opinion  No. 30, which provides for
the reporting of  the operating  results of  discontinued operations  separately
from  continuing operations. The Media Group recorded a provision of $100 (after
tax) for the estimated  loss on disposal of  the discontinued operations and  an
additional  provision of $20 to reflect  the cumulative effect on deferred taxes
of the  1993  federally mandated  increase  in  income tax  rates.  Income  from
discontinued  operations prior to  June 1, 1993,  was $38, net  of $15 in income
taxes. Income from discontinued operations subsequent to June 1, 1993, is  being
deferred  and was  included within  the provision  for loss  on disposal  of the
capital assets segment.
 
    DIRECTORY AND  INFORMATION  SERVICES    Excluding the  effect  of  the  1993
restructuring  charge  of $31,  income from  directory and  information services
operations decreased  1.6  percent  in  1994, to  $247.  Costs  related  to  the
development  and launching of new products in directory and information services
offset income growth from the Yellow Pages publishing operations.
 
    WIRELESS COMMUNICATIONS  Excluding the effects  of the $41 gain on the  sale
of  paging operations in 1994  and a $45 restructuring  charge in 1993, cellular
income increased $24  to $26 in  1994. The increase  is due to  the addition  of
367,000 subscribers in 1994, a 61 percent increase compared with 1993.

    CABLE AND TELECOMMUNICATIONS  On December 6, 1994, the Media Group purchased
the  Atlanta Systems for $1.2 billion. The  results of operations of the Atlanta
Systems have been included in the Media Group's results of operations since  the
date of acquisition which did not have a material impact on 1994 net income.
 
    OPERATING  RESULTS  OF UNCONSOLIDATED  EQUITY  INVESTMENTS   TWE partnership
losses increased  in 1994  primarily  due to  the  full year  impact  (including
financing  costs) of the TWE investment compared  with three months in 1993. The
effects of lower prices for cable  services also contributed to the higher  loss
in 1994.
 
    In  1994, losses related to international  equity investments increased as a
result of expansion  of the  customer base at  One 2  One and build  out of  the
network at TeleWest.

  The  paging business was sold in June 1994. Results reflect operations for the
  six months ending June 30, 1994.
 
    During 1994, Media Group  sales and other revenues  increased 25 percent  to
$1,862,  excluding the effect of the 1994 Atlanta Systems acquisition and paging
sale. The  increase was  primarily  due to  strong  growth in  cellular  service
revenue.
 
    DIRECTORY  AND  INFORMATION  SERVICES    Revenues  related  to  Yellow Pages
directory advertising increased approximately $59, or 6.5 percent, due primarily
to pricing. Product enhancements and  the effect of improved marketing  programs
on  business volume  also contributed  to the  increase in  revenues. Non-Yellow
Pages revenues increased $11,  including $7 related  to new products.  Partially
offsetting  these  increases  was the  absence  of revenues  related  to certain
publishing, software development and marketing operations that were sold,  which
reduced revenues by $22.
 
    The  increase in international directory publishing revenues is attributable
to U S WEST's May 1994 purchase of Thomson Directories.
 
    WIRELESS COMMUNICATIONS  Cellular service revenues increased 43 percent,  to
$633  in 1994, due to  a 61 percent increase in  subscribers (with 24 percent of
the additions occurring in December), partially  offset by an 8 percent drop  in
average revenue per subscriber to $70.00 per month.
 
    Cellular equipment revenues increased 90 percent, to $120 in 1994, primarily
due  to  an 83  percent  increase in  gross  customer additions,  with  a higher
percentage of those customers purchasing  equipment than in 1993. This  increase
was  partially offset by  a 13 percent  decline in the  average selling price of
wireless phones.

    Media Group operating income increased 7 percent, to $383 in 1994, excluding
the effects of the one-time items described in Notes 1 and 2 to the table above.
Revenue growth, partially offset by higher operating expenses, provided an  10.5
percent increase in 1994 EBITDA, on a comparable basis.
 
    DIRECTORY  AND  INFORMATION  SERVICES   Excluding  the  effect  of  the 1993
restructuring charge  of  $50,  operating income  from  domestic  directory  and
information  services operations decreased $12, or 3 percent, in 1994. Operating
income related to the  domestic Yellow Pages  directory business increased  $20.
The  increase was  driven by strong  revenue growth.  Non-Yellow Pages operating
income  decreased  $32,  primarily  a  result  of  increased  costs  related  to
development of new database marketing and interactive services.
 
    The  increase  in  international directory  publishing  operating  income is
attributable to U S WEST's May 1994 purchase of Thomson Directories.
 
    WIRELESS COMMUNICATIONS   Excluding  the effect  of the  1993  restructuring
charge  of $70,  cellular operating  income doubled  in 1994  to $41.  This is a
result of revenue  increases associated  with the  rapidly expanding  subscriber
base  and decreases in  the costs incurred  to acquire and  maintain a customer.
Cellular EBITDA increased $55,  or 44 percent in  1994. Cellular service  EBITDA
margin was 28.4 percent, essentially unchanged compared with 1993.
 
    OTHER    Other  operating  income  decreased  primarily  due  to  growth  in
international operations and  the inclusion of  administrative costs related  to
the  TWE investment  for the full  year in  1994, compared with  three months in
1993.

    Interest expense  increased  $39,  primarily  as  a  result  of  incremental
financing costs associated with the September 1993 TWE investment.
 
    Equity  losses in  unconsolidated ventures  increased $47,  primarily due to
start-up costs related to the build out of TeleWest's network and costs  related
to the expansion of the customer base at One 2 One.
 
    Other  income increased  $37, primarily  due to an  $18 increase  in the TWE
management fee. This  increase resulted from  owning the investment  for a  full
year  in 1994, compared with three months  in 1993. Other income also includes a
$10 gain on the sale of certain software development and marketing operations in
1994.

LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES --THREE YEARS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 1995
 
OPERATING ACTIVITIES
 
    Cash provided by operating activities increased $89 in 1995, to $640. During
1995,  an  income tax  payment related  to the  1994 partial  sale of  the Media
Group's joint venture interest in  TeleWest reduced cash provided by  operations
by  $60. Adjusted for this  one-time income tax payment,  operating cash flow of
the Media Group increased $149. Growth in operations from the cellular  business
and  acquisition of the  Atlanta Systems contributed to  the increase. Growth in
operating cash flow from directory and information services operations has  been
reduced  by investments related  to its growth  initiatives. Operating cash flow
from Media Group businesses  was partially offset by  a significant increase  in
income  taxes paid in 1995,  primarily due to lower  tax benefits generated from
the investment in TWE.
 
    Cash provided by operating  activities of the Media  Group increased $28  in
1994 compared with 1993 primarily due to expansion of the cellular business.
 
    The  Media Group expects that  cash from operations will  not be adequate to
fund expected cash requirements. Additional  financing will come primarily  from
new debt.
 
INVESTING ACTIVITIES
 
    Total  capital expenditures of the  Media Group were $363,  $349 and $193 in
1995, 1994 and 1993, respectively, the  majority was devoted to enhancement  and
expansion of the cellular network. In 1996, capital expenditures are expected to
exceed  $600,  of which  approximately 50  percent relates  to expansion  of the
cellular network  to  increase coverage  and  capacity, and  nearly  40  percent
relates to enhancement of the Atlanta Systems. The Media Group is in the process
of  upgrading its Atlanta Systems to  750 megahertz capacity, which will provide
more reliability, better  signal quality  and additional  capacity. The  upgrade
will  enable  the  provision  of  enhanced  cable,  data  and telecommunications
services to its Atlanta customers.
 
    Investing activities of the Media  Group also include equity investments  in
international  ventures. In 1995, the Media Group invested $681 in international
ventures, primarily investments in Malaysia, the

           FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (CONTINUED)
Netherlands, the Czech Republic and the United Kingdom. The Media Group invested
approximately $444 in developing international businesses in 1994, including the
acquisition of Thomson Directories. The Media Group anticipates that investments
in  international  ventures  will  approximate  $400  in  1996.  This   includes
investments  for  recently awarded  licenses to  provide cellular  service using
digital technology  in  India  and  Poland.  At December  31,  1995,  U  S  WEST
guaranteed  debt  in  the  principal amount  of  approximately  $140  related to
international ventures.
 
    In March 1995, PCS PrimeCo was awarded PCS licenses in 11 markets. The Media
Group's share of the cost of the  licenses was approximately $268, all of  which
was  funded in 1995.  Under the PCS  PrimeCo partnership agreement,  U S WEST is
required to fund approximately 24 percent of PCS PrimeCo's operating and capital
costs, including licensing costs.  U S WEST anticipates  that its total  funding
obligations  to PCS  PrimeCo during the  next three years  will be approximately
$400.
 
    In 1994, the Media Group received cash proceeds of $143 from the sale of its
paging operations. In 1993, cash proceeds of $30 were received from the sale  of
certain  nonstrategic lines  of business. The  Media Group did  not receive cash
from the 1994 partial sale of its joint venture interest in TeleWest or from the
1995 merger. All  proceeds from the  1994 sale  have been used  by TeleWest  for
general business purposes, including financing both construction and operations,
and repaying debt.
 
    On  February 27, 1996,  U S WEST  announced a definitive  agreement to merge
with Continental. Continental, the nation's third-largest cable operator, serves
4.2 million domestic customers,  passes more than  seven million domestic  homes
and holds significant other domestic and international properties. U S WEST will
purchase  all of  Continental's stock  for approximately  $5.3 billion  and will
assume Continental's debt and other  obligations, which amount to  approximately
$5.5  billion.  Consideration for  the $5.3  billion in  equity will  consist of
approximately $1  billion in  U S  WEST preferred  stock, convertible  to  Media
Stock;  and, at U S WEST's option, between  $1 billion and $1.5 billion in cash,
and $2.8 billion  to $3.3  billion in shares  of Media  Stock. The  transaction,
which is expected to close in the fourth quarter of 1996, is subject to a number
of  conditions and approvals, including  approvals from Continental shareholders
and local franchising and government authorities.
 
FINANCING ACTIVITIES
 
    During 1995,  debt  increased  $287  primarily due  to  new  investments  in
international  ventures, cash funding of the PCS licenses and a reclassification
of debt from net investment in assets held for sale. During fourth-quarter 1995,
U S WEST  issued $130  of exchangeable notes,  or Debt  Exchangeable for  Common
Stock  ("DECS"),  due  December  15,  1998. Upon  maturity,  each  DECS  will be
mandatorily exchanged  by U  S WEST  for shares  of Enhance  Financial  Services
Group,  Inc.  ("Enhance")  or,  at  U S  WEST's  option,  redeemed  at  the cash
equivalent. The  capital  assets  segment  currently  holds  approximately  31.5
percent of the outstanding Enhance common stock.
 
    These  increases in debt were partially offset by reductions of debt related
to the  investment in  TWE and  a  refinancing of  commercial paper  by  issuing
Company-obligated  mandatorily redeemable  preferred securities  of a subsidiary
trust holding solely Company-guaranteed debentures ("Preferred Securities"). U S
WEST issued $600 of  Preferred Securities in 1995.  The payment of interest  and
redemption  amounts to holders  of the securities  are fully and unconditionally
guaranteed by U S WEST.
 
    Excluding debt associated with the capital assets segment, the Media Group's
percentage of  debt to  total capital  at December  31, 1995,  was 29.1  percent
compared  with 29.9 percent at December 31, 1994. Including debt associated with
the capital assets segment, Preferred Securities and other preferred stock,  the
Media  Group's percentage of debt to total  capital was 44.2 percent at December
31, 1995, and 42.8 percent at December 31, 1994.

                    MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF
           FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (CONTINUED)
 
    Debt increased $288 in 1994, primarily due to the December 1994  acquisition
of  the Atlanta Systems, partially  offset by reductions in  debt related to the
investment in TWE. The cash investment related to the acquisition of the Atlanta
Systems was $745, obtained through short-term borrowing.
 
    U S WEST  maintains a commercial  paper program to  finance short-term  cash
flow  requirements, as  well as  to maintain a  presence in  the short-term debt
market. U  S  WEST maintains  lines  of credit  aggregating  approximately  $1.3
billion,  which  is  available to  both  the  Media Group  and  the nonregulated
subsidiaries of  the Communications  Group in  accordance with  their  borrowing
needs.  Under registration  statements filed  with the  SEC, as  of December 31,
1995, U S WEST  is permitted to  issue up to approximately  $1.2 billion of  new
debt  securities,  available  to  both  the  Media  Group  and  the nonregulated
subsidiaries of the Communications Group.
 
    Debt related to discontinued operations decreased  $487 in 1995 and $213  in
1994.  Cash to the capital assets segment of $101 in 1994 primarily reflects the
payment of debt, net of $154 in proceeds from the sale of 8.1 million shares  of
Financial  Security  Assurance  Holdings,  Ltd. ("FSA"),  an  investment  of the
capital assets segment.  For financial  reporting purposes debt  of the  capital
assets  segment is netted  against the related assets.  See Media Group Combined
Financial Statements -- Note 20: Net Investment in Assets Held for Sale.
 
    The Media Group reinvests earnings, if  any, for future growth and does  not
expect to pay dividends on the Media Stock in the foreseeable future.
 
    In connection with U S WEST's announcement on February 27, 1996 of a planned
merger  with Continental, U  S WEST, Inc.'s  credit rating is  being reviewed by
credit rating agencies, which may result in a downgrading.
 
    Financing activities for  the nonregulated  Communications Group  businesses
and  the  Media  Group,  including the  issuance,  repayment  and  repurchase of
short-term and  long-term debt,  and the  issuance and  repurchase of  Preferred
Securities,  is managed by U S WEST on a centralized basis. Financing activities
for U S WEST Communications  is separately identified and  accounted for in U  S
WEST's  records  and  U  S  WEST Communications  continues  to  conduct  its own
borrowing activities. Debt  incurred and investments  made by U  S WEST and  its
subsidiaries  is  specifically  allocated  to  and  reflected  on  the financial
statements of the Media Group except that debt incurred and investments made  by
U S WEST and its subsidiaries on behalf of the nonregulated Communications Group
businesses and all debt incurred and investments made by U S WEST Communications
is  specifically allocated to  and reflected on the  financial statements of the
Communications Group. Debt incurred by U S  WEST or a subsidiary on behalf of  a
Group  is  charged to  such Group  at the  borrowing rate  of U  S WEST  or such
subsidiary.
 
RISK MANAGEMENT
 
    The Media Group is exposed to market risks arising from changes in  interest
rates  and foreign exchange rates. Derivative  financial instruments are used to
manage these risks. U S WEST  does not use derivative financial instruments  for
trading purposes.
 
INTEREST RATE RISK MANAGEMENT
 
    The  objective of the  interest rate risk management  program is to minimize
the total cost  of debt. Interest  rate swaps are  used to adjust  the ratio  of
fixed-  to variable-rate debt. The market value of the debt portfolio, including
the interest rate swaps, is monitored and compared with predetermined benchmarks
to evaluate the effectiveness of the risk management program.
 
    Notional amounts of interest rate swaps outstanding were $825 and $850 as of
December 31, 1995 and 1994, respectively, with various maturities that extend to
2004. The estimated effect of U S WEST's interest

           FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (CONTINUED)
rate derivative transactions was to adjust  the level of fixed-rate debt of  the
Media  Group from  86 percent to  87 percent at  December 31, 1995,  and from 68
percent to  71  percent  of  the  total debt  portfolio  at  December  31,  1994
(including debt associated with the capital assets segment).
 
FOREIGN EXCHANGE RISK MANAGEMENT
 
    U  S WEST has entered into forward and option contracts to manage the market
risks associated with fluctuations in foreign exchange rates after consideration
of offsetting  foreign  exposures among  international  operations. The  use  of
forward  and option  contracts allow U  S WEST  to fix or  cap the  cost of firm
foreign investment commitments in countries with freely convertible  currencies.
The  market  values of  the foreign  exchange  positions, including  the hedging
instruments, are continuously monitored  and compared with predetermined  levels
of acceptable risk.
 
    Notional   amounts  of   foreign  exchange  forward   and  option  contracts
outstanding were $456 and $170 as  of December 31, 1995 and 1994,  respectively,
with  maturities of  one year  or less. These  contracts were  primarily for the
purchase of Dutch  guilders and  British pounds in  1995 and  British pounds  in
1994.
 
    The  Media  Group  had  foreign  exchange  risks  associated  with  a  Dutch
guilder-denominated payable  in  the  translated principal  amount  of  $216  at
December  31, 1995, and British  pound-denominated receivables in the translated
principal amounts of $139 and $48  at December 31, 1995 and 1994,  respectively,
of  which  $63 and  $48 of  these respective  balances are  with a  wholly owned
subsidiary. These positions were hedged in 1995.
 
DISPOSITION OF THE CAPITAL ASSETS SEGMENT
 
    U S WEST announced a  plan of disposition of  the capital assets segment  in
June  1993. See the  Media Group Combined  Financial Statements --  Note 20: Net
Investment in Assets Held for Sale. In December 1993, U S WEST sold $2.0 billion
of finance receivables and the business of U S WEST Financial Services, Inc.  to
NationsBank  Corporation. Proceeds  from the sale  of $2.1 billion  were used to
repay related debt.
 
    During 1994, U S WEST reduced its ownership interest in FSA, a member of the
capital assets segment, to 60.9 percent and its voting interest to 49.8  percent
through  a series  of transactions.  In May  and June  1994, U  S WEST  sold 8.1
million shares of FSA common  stock and received $154  in net proceeds from  the
public  offering. In December 1995, FSA merged with Capital Guaranty Corporation
for shares of FSA and cash of  $51. The transaction was valued at  approximately
$203  and reduced U S  WEST's ownership interest in FSA  to 50.3 percent and its
voting interest to  41.7 percent. U  S WEST expects  to monetize and  ultimately
reduce its ownership in FSA through the issuance of Debt Exchangeable for Common
Stock  ("DECS") in 1996. At maturity, each DECS will be mandatorily exchanged by
U S WEST  for FSA  common stock  held by  U S  WEST or,  at U  S WEST's  option,
redeemed at the cash equivalent.
 
    On  September 2, 1994, U S WEST issued to Fund American Enterprises Holdings
Inc. ("FFC") 50,000 shares of cumulative redeemable preferred stock for a  total
of  $50. The shares are mandatorily redeemable in year ten and, at the option of
FFC, the preferred stock also can be redeemed for common shares of FSA.
 
    U S WEST Real Estate, Inc.  has sold various properties totaling $120,  $327
and  $66 in 1995, 1994  and 1993, respectively. The  sales proceeds were in line
with estimates.  Proceeds  from building  sales  were primarily  used  to  repay
related  debt. U S WEST has completed  construction of existing buildings in the
commercial  real  estate  portfolio   and  expects  to  substantially   complete
liquidation  of this portfolio by 1998.  The remaining balance of assets subject
to sale is approximately $490, net of reserves, as of December 31, 1995.
 
COMPETITIVE STRATEGY
 
    The Media Group's  strategy is based  on the belief  that communication  and

replacing traditional distribution channels. To  meet the needs of this  growing
market,   the  Media  Group  provides  local  connections  and  then  integrates
market-based service offerings to meet the  needs of end users. The Media  Group
executes   this  strategy  through   three  lines  of   business  --  cable  and
telecommunications, wireless  and  directory  and  information  services  --  in
selected high-growth markets worldwide.
 
COMPETITIVE AND REGULATORY ENVIRONMENT
 
    CABLE  AND TELECOMMUNICATIONS  The Telecommunications Act of 1996 (the "1996
Act") opens competition by  permitting local telephone companies,  long-distance
carriers  and cable television companies to  enter each other's businesses. This
legislation will  enable the  Media  Group to  provide "one-stop  shopping"  for
voice,  video and data services,  a key objective of  the Media Group. The Media
Group  is   currently   in   the   process   of   negotiating   reasonable   and
non-discriminatory  local  interconnection  rates,  terms  and  conditions  with
BellSouth and is  planning on entering  the local exchange  market, through  the
Atlanta Systems, on a competitive basis by the end of 1996.
 
    The  Atlanta Systems generally compete for viewer attention with programming
from  a  variety  of  sources,  including  the  direct  reception  of  broadcast
television signals by the viewer's own antenna, satellite master antenna service
and  direct broadcast satellite  services. Cable television  systems are also in
competition for  both viewers  and  advertising in  varying degrees  with  other
communications  and entertainment media. Such  competition may increase with the
development and growth of new technologies.
 
    The 1996 Act has  amended certain aspects of  the Cable Television  Consumer
Protection  and Competition Act of  1992 ("the 1992 Cable  Act"). Under the 1996
Act, cable  rates  are deregulated  effective  March  31, 1999,  or  earlier  if
competition  exists. In  addition, the provisions  of the 1996  Act simplify the
process  of  filing  rate  complaints,  relax  uniform  rate  requirements   and
subscriber notice provisions, expand the definition of effective competition and
eliminate  certain restrictions  on the sale  of cable  systems. Current program
access restrictions applying to cable operators are extended to common  carriers
by   the  1996  Act.  The  1996  Act  also  eliminates  certain  cross-ownership
restrictions between cable operators, broadcasters and multichannel,  multipoint
distribution system operators.
 
    Cable  television systems  are also  subject to  local regulation, typically
imposed through the franchising process. Local officials may be involved in  the
initial  franchise  selection,  system  design  and  construction,  safety, rate
regulation, customer  service  standards, billing  practices,  community-related
programming and services, franchise renewal and imposition of franchise fees.
 
    In  1995, the  Georgia legislature  removed the  legal prohibition  on local
telephone competition  by authorizing  competition in  local telephone  exchange
service.  The Media  Group has  received certification  from the  Georgia Public
Service Commission to provide local  switched and nonswitched telephone  service
in  Georgia  and,  with  the  passage of  the  1996  Act,  certain long-distance
services.

           FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued)
 
    WIRELESS COMMUNICATIONS  There are two competitive cellular licenses in each
market.  Competition is based on  the price of cellular  service, the quality of
the service and the size of the  geographic area served. The development of  PCS
services  will increase the number of  competitors and the level of competition.
The Media Group  is unable to  estimate the  impact of the  availability of  PCS
services on its cellular operations, though it could be significant.
 
    The  wireless operations are subject to regulation by federal and some state
and local authorities. The construction and transfer of cellular systems in  the
United  States are regulated  by the FCC  pursuant to the  Communications Act of
1934. The  FCC regulates  construction  and operation  of cellular  systems  and
licensing  and  technical  standards  for the  provision  of  cellular telephone
service. Pursuant to Congress' 1993  Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act, the  FCC
adopted  rules preempting state  and local governments  from regulating wireless
entry and most rates.
 
    The passage of the 1996 Act eliminates long-distance restrictions imposed by
the Modified Final Judgment ("MFJ"). As a result, the Media Group, including its
wireless partners,  are now  able to  offer integrated  local and  long-distance
services.  The 1996 Act  also permits the  Media Group to  enter into activities
related to the manufacture of telecommunications equipment.
 
    DIRECTORY AND  INFORMATION  SERVICES   The  Media Group  may  face  emerging
competition   in  the   provision  of   interactive  services   from  cable  and
entertainment companies,  on-line  services  and  other  information  providers.
Directory  listings are beginning to be offered via electronic databases through
telephone company and  third party networks.  As such offerings  expand and  are
enhanced   through  interactivity  and  other  features,  the  Media  Group  may
experience heightened competition in  its directory publishing businesses.  With
the  passage of the  1996 Act, the Media  Group will be  able to provide certain
information services across LATA  boundaries. The Media  Group will continue  to
expand  its core  products and develop  and package new  information products to
meet its customers' needs.

    The following table and  discussion is not required  by GAAP or intended  to
replace  the Combined Financial Statements prepared  in accordance with GAAP. It
is presented supplementally because the Media Group believes that  proportionate
financial  and operating data facilitate the understanding and assessment of its
Combined Financial  Statements.  Proportionate  accounting  reflects  the  Media
Group's relative ownership interests in operating revenues and expenses for both
its  consolidated  and  equity  method  investments.  The  financial information
included below departs materially from  GAAP because it aggregates the  revenues
and operating income of entities not controlled by the Media Group with those of
the  consolidated operations  of the Media  Group. The  following table includes
allocations of  Media  Group corporate  activity.  The table  does  not  reflect
financial data of the capital assets segment, which had net assets of $429, $302
and  $554 at December 31, 1995, 1994 and 1993, respectively. Previously reported
amounts have been reclassified to conform with current year presentation.

(1)
  The proportionate results  include the  Media Group's  25.51 percent  pro-rata
  priority  and residual equity interests in  reported TWE results. The reported
  TWE results are prepared in accordance with GAAP and have not been adjusted to
  report  TWE  investments  accounted   for  under  the   equity  method  on   a
  proportionate basis.
 
(2)
  Proportionate  EBITDA  represents the  Media  Group's equity  interest  in the
  entities  multiplied   by  the   entities'   EBITDA.  1993   EBITDA   excludes
  restructuring  charges of  $59 and  $50 related  to the  domestic wireless and
  directory and information services segments, respectively.
 
(3)
  POPs are the estimated  market population multiplied by  U S WEST's  ownership
  interest in the market.
 
PROPORTIONATE RESULTS OF OPERATIONS -- 1995 COMPARED WITH 1994
 
    In  1995, proportionate Media  Group revenue increased  17 percent, to $5.12
billion, and  EBITDA  increased 17  percent,  to $1.15  billion,  excluding  the
one-time  impacts of the 1994 Atlanta Systems acquisition and the sale of paging
operations. Strong  growth in  both domestic  cable and  telecommunications  and
wireless communications contributed to the increases.
 
    CABLE  AND TELECOMMUNICATIONS   During  1995, proportionate  revenue for the
Media Group  domestic  cable  and  telecommunications  operations  increased  12
percent,  to $2,661,  and proportionate  EBITDA increased  11 percent,  to $589,
excluding the one-time impact  of the 1994 acquisition  of the Atlanta  systems.
Proportionate  revenue  and EBITDA  growth is  primarily due  to the  TWE cable,
programming and filmed entertainment operations.  Cable growth is attributed  to
subscriber  growth of nearly six percent, excluding the impact of 1995 TWE cable
transactions, as well as increases in advertising and pay per view revenues.
 
    During  1995,  international  cable  and  telecommunications   proportionate
revenue increased $43, to $128, and proportionate EBITDA decreased $13 to ($55).
Results  for new ventures in the  Czech Republic, Netherlands and Malaysia, have
been included in the proportionate results beginning with the fourth quarter  of
1995.  The new ventures  contributed revenue of  $10 and EBITDA  of ($14), which
reflect the start-up nature of the operations.
 
    WIRELESS COMMUNICATIONS   During 1995, proportionate  revenue for the  Media
Group   domestic  wireless  operations  increased   30  percent,  to  $824,  and
proportionate EBITDA increased 52 percent, to $226,

SELECTED PROPORTIONATE FINANCIAL DATA (CONTINUED)
excluding  the  effect  of  the  paging  business,  which  was  sold  in   1994.
Proportionate  cellular service revenue  increased 39 percent,  to $736 in 1995.
This increase  is due  to a  64 percent  increase in  proportionate  subscribers
partially offset by a decrease in average revenue per subscriber.
 
    During  1995,  international wireless  communications  proportionate revenue
increased $109,  to $295,  and  proportionate EBITDA  increased $28,  to  ($40).
Venture results for Indonesia and Russia have been included in the proportionate
results  beginning with the  fourth quarter of  1995. These ventures contributed
revenue of $9  and EBITDA  of ($4),  which reflect  the start-up  nature of  the
operations.
 
    DIRECTORY  AND  INFORMATION  SERVICES   Proportionate  revenue  for domestic
directory and information services increased 6  percent, to $1,065 in 1995,  and
proportionate  EBITDA increased  3 percent,  to $426.  The proportionate revenue
increase is due to price and volume increases. Revenue increases were  partially
offset  by reinvestments in the business, resulting in the 3 percent increase in
EBITDA.
 
    Proportionate revenue  for  international directories  businesses  increased
$63,  to $142 in 1995, and proportionate EBITDA increased $1, to $3. Results for
Listel, a Brazilian directories operation, have been included in the Media Group
proportionate results beginning with the fourth quarter 1995. Listel contributed
proportionate revenue of $18 and EBITDA of $2.
 
PROPORTIONATE DEBT
 
    Proportionate debt increased $552 in 1995. The increase is primarily related
to the Media  Group's international  investments. Both  TeleWest and  One 2  One
raised  cash  through  the issuance  of  debt  in 1995,  primarily  to  fund the
continued expansion of their businesses.

              FOR THE YEARS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 1995, 1994 AND 1993
                             (DOLLARS IN MILLIONS)
 
NOTE 1: RECAPITALIZATION PLAN
    On  October  31,  1995, the  shareholders  of  U S  WEST,  Inc.,  a Colorado
corporation  ("U  S   WEST  Colorado")   voted  to  approve   a  proposal   (the
"Recapitalization  Plan") adopted by  the Board of  Directors of U  S WEST, Inc.
(the "Board") to  reincorporate in  Delaware and  create two  classes of  common
stock   that  are  intended  to  reflect   separately  the  performance  of  the
communications and  multimedia  businesses.  Under  the  Recapitalization  Plan,
shareholders  approved an Agreement and Plan of Merger between U S WEST Colorado
and U S WEST, Inc., a Delaware  corporation ("U S WEST" or "Company"),  pursuant
to which U S WEST continues as the surviving corporation. In connection with the
merger,  the  Certificate of  Incorporation of  U  S WEST  has been  amended and
restated to designate  two classes of  common stock of  U S WEST,  one class  of
which   is  authorized   as  U   S  WEST   Communications  Group   Common  Stock
("Communications Stock"), and the  other class which is  authorized as U S  WEST
Media Group Common Stock ("Media Stock"). Effective November 1, 1995, each share
of  common stock  of U  S WEST  Colorado was  converted into  one share  each of
Communications Stock and Media Stock.
 
    The Communications  Stock  and Media  Stock  provide shareholders  with  two
distinct  securities that are intended  to reflect separately the communications
businesses  of  U  S  WEST  (the  "Communications  Group")  and  the  multimedia
businesses  of U S WEST (the "Media Group" and, together with the Communications
Group, the "Groups").
 
    The Communications Group is comprised of U S WEST Communications, Inc. ("U S
WEST Communications"), U S WEST Communications Services, Inc., U S WEST  Federal
Services,  Inc., U  S WEST  Advanced Technologies,  Inc. and  U S  WEST Business
Resources,  Inc.   The  Communications   Group  primarily   provides   regulated
communications  services  to  more  than  25  million  residential  and business
customers within a 14 state region.
 
    The Media Group is  comprised of U S  WEST Marketing Resources Group,  Inc.,
which  publishes  White and  Yellow  Pages telephone  directories,  and provides
directory and  information  services, U  S  WEST NewVector  Group,  Inc.,  which
provides  communications  and information  products  and services  over wireless
networks, U S WEST  Multimedia Communications, Inc.,  which owns domestic  cable
television  operations  and investments,  and U  S WEST  International Holdings,
Inc.,  which   primarily   owns   investments   in   international   cable   and
telecommunications, wireless communications and directory publishing operations.
 
NOTE 2: SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES
 
    BASIS  OF  PRESENTATION   The Combined  Financial  Statements of  the Groups
comprise  all  of  the  accounts  included  in  the  corresponding  Consolidated
Financial  Statements  of  U S  WEST.  Investments in  less  than majority-owned
ventures are generally accounted for using the equity method. The separate Group
Combined Financial  Statements have  been prepared  on a  basis that  management
believes  to  be  reasonable  and  appropriate  and  include:  (i)  the combined
historical  balance  sheets,  results  of  operations  and  cash  flows  of  the
businesses  that comprise each  of the Groups,  with all significant intra-group
amounts and  transactions eliminated;  (ii) in  the case  of the  Communications
Group Combined Financial Statements, certain corporate assets and liabilities of
U  S WEST  and related  transactions identified  with the  Communications Group;
(iii) in the case  of the Media Group  Combined Financial Statements, all  other
corporate  assets and liabilities and related transactions of U S WEST; and (iv)
an allocated portion of the corporate expense of U S WEST. Transactions  between
the Communications Group and the Media Group have not been eliminated.
 
    Notwithstanding   the  allocation  of   assets  and  liabilities  (including
contingent liabilities)  and  stockholders' equity  between  the  Communications
Group  and the Media Group for the purpose of preparing the respective financial
statements of such Group,  holders of Communications Stock  and Media Stock  are
subject  to risks associated with an investment in a single company and all of U
S WEST's  businesses, assets  and  liabilities. Such  allocation of  assets  and
liabilities   and   change  in   the  equity   structure  of   U  S   WEST  does

NOTE 2: SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (CONTINUED)
not result  in a  distribution or  spin-off  to shareholders  of any  assets  or
liabilities  of  U  S  WEST  or any  of  its  subsidiaries  or  otherwise affect
responsibility for  the liabilities  of U  S  WEST or  such subsidiaries.  As  a
result, the rights of the holders of U S WEST's or any of its subsidiaries' debt
are  not affected. Financial effects  arising from either Group  that affect U S
WEST's results  of  operations or  financial  condition could,  if  significant,
affect the results of operations or financial position of the other Group or the
market  price of the class of common stock  relating to the other Group. Any net
losses of  the  Communications  Group  or the  Media  Group,  and  dividends  or
distributions  on,  or  repurchases  of  Communications  Stock,  Media  Stock or
preferred stock, will reduce the funds of U S WEST legally available for payment
of dividends on both the Communications Stock and Media Stock. Accordingly,  the
Media Group Combined Financial Statements should be read in conjunction with U S
WEST's  Consolidated Financial Statements and  the Communications Group Combined
Financial Statements.
 
    The accounting policies  described herein applicable  to the preparation  of
the  Combined  Financial  Statements  of  the Media  Group  may  be  modified or
rescinded  at  the  sole  discretion  of  the  Board  without  approval  of  the
stockholders,  although there is  no present intention  to do so.  The Board may
also adopt additional policies depending on the circumstances. Any determination
of the Board to modify or rescind such policies, or to add additional  policies,
including  any  decision  that  would have  disparate  impacts  upon  holders of
Communications Stock and Media Stock, would be  made by the Board in good  faith
and  in the honest belief that such decision is in the best interests of all U S
WEST stockholders, including the holders of Communications Stock and the holders
of Media  Stock. In  making  such determination,  the  Board may  also  consider
regulatory requirements imposed on U S WEST Communications by the public utility
commissions  of  various states  and the  Federal Communications  Commission. In
addition, generally accepted  accounting principles require  that any change  in
accounting  policy be  preferable (in  accordance with  such principles)  to the
policy previously established.
 
    Certain reclassifications within the Combined Financial Statements have been
made to conform to the current year presentation.
 
    ALLOCATION OF SHARED SERVICES  Certain costs relating to U S WEST's  general
and  administrative  services  (including certain  executive  management, legal,
accounting and auditing,  tax, treasury,  strategic planning  and public  policy
services)  are directly assigned by  U S WEST to  each Group, and segment within
the Group, based on  actual utilization or are  allocated based on each  Group's
operating  expenses,  number of  employees,  external revenues,  average capital
and/or average equity. Beginning in 1996, certain shared services will no longer
be allocated to each segment  of the Media Group but  will be retained at  Media
Group  headquarters. U  S WEST  charges each  Group for  such services  at fully
distributed cost. These direct and indirect allocations were $55, $38 and $43 in
1995, 1994 and  1993, respectively.  In 1995, the  direct allocations  comprised
approximately 40 percent of the total shared corporate services allocated to the
Media  Group.  It is  not  practicable to  provide  a detailed  estimate  of the
expenses which would  be recognized  if the Media  Group were  a separate  legal
entity.  However, U  S WEST believes  that under the  Recapitalization Plan each
Group would benefit  from synergy's  with the other,  including lower  operating
costs than might be incurred if each Group was a separate legal entity.
 
    ALLOCATION OF INCOME TAXES  Federal, state and local income taxes, which are
determined  on a consolidated or combined basis,  are allocated to each Group in
accordance with tax sharing agreements between U S WEST and the entities  within
the  Groups. The  allocations will  generally reflect  each Group's contribution
(positive or  negative)  to consolidated  taxable  income and  consolidated  tax
credits.  A Group will  be compensated only at  such time as,  and to the extent
that, its tax attributes are utilized by U S WEST in a combined or  consolidated
income tax filing. Federal and state tax refunds and carryforwards or carrybacks
of  tax attributes will  generally be allocated  to the Group  to which such tax
attributes relate.

                              U S WEST MEDIA GROUP
               NOTES TO COMBINED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (CONTINUED)
 
NOTE 2: SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (CONTINUED)
    The Media Group includes members which operate in states where U S WEST does
not file  consolidated or  combined  state income  tax returns.  Separate  state
income  tax returns are filed by these members in accordance with the respective
states' laws and regulations. The members  record a tax provision on a  separate
company  basis in  accordance with  the requirements  of Statement  of Financial
Accounting Standard ("SFAS") No. 109.
 
    GROUP  FINANCING    Financing  activities  for  the  Media  Group  and   the
nonregulated  Communications Group businesses, including the issuance, repayment
and repurchase of short-term and long-term debt, and the issuance and repurchase
of preferred  securities,  are managed  by  U S  WEST  on a  centralized  basis.
Financing  activities for U S WEST  Communications are separately identified and
accounted for in U S WEST's records and U S WEST Communications conducts its own
borrowing activities. Debt  incurred and investments  made by U  S WEST and  its
subsidiaries  on behalf  of the  Media Group  are specifically  allocated to and
reflected on the  financial statements  of the  Media Group.  Debt incurred  and
investments  made by U S WEST and its subsidiaries on behalf of the nonregulated
businesses of the  Communications Group  and all debt  incurred and  investments
made  by U S WEST Communications are  specifically allocated to and reflected on
the financial statements of the Communications Group. Debt incurred by U S  WEST
or  a subsidiary on behalf of a Group  is charged to such Group at the borrowing
rate of U S WEST or such subsidiary.
 
    As of November 1, 1995, the effective date of the Recapitalization Plan, U S
WEST does not intend  to transfer funds between  the Groups, except for  certain
short-term,  ordinary course advances of funds at market rates associated with U
S WEST's centralized cash management. Such short-term transfers of funds will be
accounted for as  short-term loans between  the Groups bearing  interest at  the
market  rate at  which management  determines the  borrowing Group  could obtain
funds on a short-term  basis. If the Board,  in its sole discretion,  determines
that  a transfer of funds between the Groups  should be accounted for as a long-
term loan, the Board would establish the terms on which such loan would be made,
including the  interest rate,  amortization  schedule, maturity  and  redemption
terms.  Such terms would generally reflect  the then prevailing terms upon which
management determines such  Group could  borrow funds  on a  similar basis.  The
financial  statements of the  lending Group will be  credited, and the financial
statements of the borrowing Group will be  charged, with the amount of any  such
loan,  as  well  as  with  periodic interest  accruing  thereon.  The  Board may
determine that a transfer  of funds from the  Communications Group to the  Media
Group  should  be accounted  for as  an  equity contribution,  in which  case an
inter-group interest (determined by the Board  based on the then current  market
value  of  shares  of Media  Stock)  will  either be  created  or  increased, as
applicable.  Similarly,  if  an  inter-group  interest  exists,  the  Board  may
determine  that a transfer of  funds from the Media  Group to the Communications
Group should be accounted for as a reduction in the inter-group interest.
 
    DIVIDENDS   Under the  Recapitalization Plan,  U S  WEST intends  to  retain
future  earnings of the  Media Group, if  any, for the  development of the Media
Group's businesses and does not anticipate  paying dividends to the Media  Group
shareholders in the foreseeable future.
 
    EARNINGS  PER COMMON SHARE  Earnings per common share for 1995 and 1994 have
been presented on a pro forma basis to reflect the Media Group's Stock as if  it
had   been  outstanding  since  January  1,  1994.  For  periods  prior  to  the
recapitalization, the average common shares outstanding are assumed to be  equal
to the average common shares outstanding for U S WEST.
 
    INDUSTRY SEGMENTS  The businesses comprising the Media Group operate in four
industry  segments, as defined in SFAS No. 14, "Financial Reporting for Segments
of a Business  Enterprise," consisting  of directory  and information  services,
wireless  communications, cable  and telecommunications  and the  capital assets
segment, which is held for sale.

               NOTES TO COMBINED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (CONTINUED)
 
NOTE 2: SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (CONTINUED)
    Prior to January 1,  1995, the capital assets  segment was accounted for  as
discontinued  operations. Effective January 1,  1995, the capital assets segment
has been accounted for as a net investment in assets held for sale, as discussed
in Note 20 to the Media Group Combined Financial Statements.
 
    USE OF ESTIMATES  The preparation of financial statements in conformity with
generally accepted accounting principles  requires management to make  estimates
and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and
accompanying notes. Actual results could differ from those estimates.
 
    CASH  AND CASH EQUIVALENTS  Cash  and cash equivalents include highly liquid
investments with original maturities  of three months or  less that are  readily
convertible  into cash and are not subject to significant risk from fluctuations
in interest rates.
 
    PROPERTY, PLANT  AND  EQUIPMENT    The investment  in  property,  plant  and
equipment   is  carried  at  cost,  less  accumulated  depreciation.  Additions,
replacements and substantial betterments are capitalized. All other repairs  and
maintenance costs are expensed as incurred.
 
    Interest related to qualifying construction projects, including construction
projects of equity method investees, is capitalized and reflected as a reduction
of  interest expense. Amounts capitalized by the Media Group were $33, $8 and $5
in 1995, 1994 and 1993, respectively.
 
    Depreciation  is  calculated  using  the  straight-line  method.  When  such
depreciable property, plant and equipment is retired or sold, the resulting gain
or loss is included in income.
 
    INTANGIBLE  ASSETS  Intangible assets are recorded when the cost of acquired
companies exceeds  the  fair  value  of their  tangible  assets.  The  costs  of
identified  intangible assets  and goodwill  are amortized  by the straight-line
method over  periods  ranging  from  five  to  forty  years.  These  assets  are
evaluated,  with other  related assets, for  impairment using  a discounted cash
flow methodology.
 
    FOREIGN CURRENCY  TRANSLATION    Assets  and  liabilities  of  international
investments  are  translated at  year-end exchange  rates, and  income statement
items are  translated  at  average  exchanges  rates  for  the  year.  Resulting
translation  adjustments are recorded  as a separate  component of equity. Gains
and losses resulting from foreign currency transactions are included in income.
 
    FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS  Net interest received or paid on interest rate  swaps
is  recognized over the life of the  swaps as an adjustment to interest expense.
Foreign exchange  contracts  designated  as hedges  of  firm  equity  investment
commitments  are  carried at  market value,  with gains  and losses  recorded in
equity until sale of the investment.  Forward contracts designated as hedges  of
foreign  denominated loans are  recorded at market value,  with gains and losses
recorded in income.
 
    INVESTMENTS IN DEBT SECURITIES  Debt securities are classified as  available
for  sale and are carried at fair  market value with unrealized gains and losses
included in equity.
 
    REVENUE RECOGNITION AND DEFERRED DIRECTORY COSTS  Cellular access and  cable
television  revenues are generally billed monthly,  in advance, and revenues are
recognized the following month when services are provided. Revenues derived from
wireless airtime usage are billed and recorded monthly as services are provided.
 
    Directory advertising  revenues  and  related directory  costs  of  selling,
composition,  printing and  distribution are  generally deferred  and recognized
over the  period during  which directories  are used,  normally 12  months.  For
international  operations, directory advertising  revenues and related directory
costs are deferred and recognized upon publication.
 
    INCOME TAXES  The provision for income taxes consists of an amount for taxes
currently payable and an amount for tax consequences deferred to future  periods
in accordance with SFAS No. 109. U S WEST

NOTE 2: SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (CONTINUED)
implemented SFAS No. 109, "Accounting for Income Taxes" in 1993. Adoption of the
new standard did not have a material effect on the financial position or results
of operations, primarily because of U S WEST's earlier adoption of SFAS No. 96.
 
    NEW  ACCOUNTING  STANDARDS   In  1996, U  S WEST  will  adopt SFAS  No. 121,
"Accounting for the Impairment of Long-Lived Assets and for Long-Lived Assets to
be Disposed Of."  SFAS No. 121  requires that long-lived  assets and  associated
intangibles  be  written  down  to  fair  value  whenever  an  impairment review
indicates that the carrying  value cannot be recovered  on an undiscounted  cash
flow  basis.  SFAS  No.  121  also requires  that  a  company  no  longer record
depreciation expense on assets held for sale. U S WEST expects that the adoption
of SFAS No. 121  will not have  a material effect on  its financial position  or
results of operations.
 
    In  1996, U  S WEST  will adopt  SFAS No.  123, "Accounting  for Stock-Based
Compensation." This standard establishes a fair value method for accounting  for
stock-based  compensation plans  either through  recognition or  disclosure. U S
WEST  will  adopt   this  standard  through   compliance  with  the   disclosure
requirements  set forth in SFAS  No. 123. Adoption of  the standard will have no
impact on the financial position or results of operations of U S WEST.
 
NOTE 3: RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS
 
    CUSTOMER LISTS, BILLING  AND COLLECTION,  AND OTHER SERVICES   The  domestic
publishing  operations purchase customer lists, billing and collection and other
services from the Communications Group. The  data and services are purchased  at
market price. The charges for these services were $20, $29 and $26 in 1995, 1994
and 1993, respectively.
 
    TELECOMMUNICATIONS  SERVICES    The  domestic  wireless  operations purchase
telecommunications network access and usage  from the Communications Group.  The
charges  for  these services  were  $40, $30  and $24  in  1995, 1994  and 1993,
respectively.
 
NOTE 4: INDUSTRY SEGMENTS
    Industry segment data is presented for the combined operations of the  Media
Group.  U S  WEST's equity  method investments  and the  capital assets segment,
which is held  for sale,  are included  in "Corporate  and other."  Supplemental
Media  Group information on  a proportionate basis  is presented in Management's
Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.
 
    The directory and information services segment consists of the publishing of
White and Yellow  Pages telephone directories,  database marketing services  and
interactive  services  in  domestic  and  international  markets.  The  wireless
communications segment provides information products and services over  wireless
networks  in 13 western and midwestern  states. The cable and telecommunications
segment was created with  the December 6, 1994  acquisition of cable  television
systems  in  the Atlanta  metropolitan  area. (See  Note  5 to  the  Media Group
Combined Financial Statements.)

  Includes revenue from directory publishing  activities in Europe of $122,  $78
  and  $7, operating losses of  $(1), $(1) and $(3),  and identifiable assets of
  $133, $124 and $4 for 1995, 1994 and 1993, respectively.

  Includes  U S WEST's equity method investments and the capital assets segment,

(4)
  Includes pretax restructuring  charges of $50  and $70 for  the directory  and
  information services and wireless communications segments, respectively.
 
    Operating   income  represents  sales  and  other  revenues  less  operating
expenses,  and  excludes  interest  expense,  equity  losses  in  unconsolidated
ventures,  other income and  income taxes. Identifiable  assets are those assets
used in each segment's operations. Corporate and other assets consist  primarily
of  cash, debt securities, investments in international ventures, the investment
in Time Warner  Entertainment, the net  investment in assets  held for sale  and
other  assets. Corporate  and other  operating losses  include general corporate
expenses and  administrative costs  primarily associated  with the  Media  Group
equity investments.
 
    To  ensure consistency  and quality  of service,  the wireless  segment uses
Motorola as its primary vendor for infrastructure equipment and cellular  mobile
telephone  equipment  and accessories.  In  addition, Motorola  provides ongoing
technological support for  the infrastructure equipment.  The infrastructure  of
approximately  75  percent  of  the  Media  Group's  major  cellular  markets is
comprised of Motorola equipment.
 
    During  1994,  U  S  WEST  signed  a  definitive  agreement  with   AirTouch
Communications  to combine  their domestic  cellular assets.  The initial equity
ownership of  this  cellular joint  venture  will be  approximately  70  percent
AirTouch  and approximately  30 percent Media  Group. The  combination will take
place in two phases. During Phase I,  which U S WEST entered effective  November
1, 1995, the two companies are operating their cellular properties separately. A
Wireless  Management  Company  (the  "WMC") has  been  formed  and  is providing
centralized services  to  both companies  on  a  contract basis.  In  Phase  II,

NOTE 4: INDUSTRY SEGMENTS (CONTINUED)
and  U S WEST will contribute their domestic cellular assets to the WMC. In this
phase, the Media Group will reflect its share of the combined operating  results
of  the WMC  using the equity  method of  accounting. The recent  passage of the
Telecommunications Act of  1996 has removed  significant regulatory barriers  to
completion  of Phase II of the business combination. U S WEST expects that Phase
II closing could take place by the end of 1996 or early 1997.
 
NOTE 5: ACQUISITION OF CABLE SYSTEMS
 
    ATLANTA SYSTEMS  On December 6, 1994, U S WEST acquired the stock of Wometco
Cable Corp.  and subsidiaries,  and the  assets of  Georgia Cable  Partners  and
Atlanta  Cable  Partners L.P.  (the  "Atlanta Systems"),  for  cash of  $745 and
12,779,206 U S WEST common shares valued at $459, for a total purchase price  of
approximately $1.2 billion. The Atlanta Systems' results of operations have been
included in the combined results of operations of the Media Group since the date
of  acquisition. Had the acquisition  occurred as of January  1, 1994, the Media
Group revenue  and  net  income  for  1994 would  have  been  $2,098  and  $265,
respectively.
 
    The  acquisition was accounted  for using the  purchase method. Accordingly,
the purchase  price  was  allocated to  assets  acquired  (primarily  identified
intangibles)  based on their  estimated fair values.  The identified intangibles
and goodwill are being amortized on a straight-line basis over 25 years.
 
    CONTINENTAL CABLEVISION, INC. (SUBSEQUENT EVENT)  On February 27, 1996, U  S
WEST  announced a  definitive agreement  to merge  with Continental Cablevision,
Inc. ("Continental"). Continental,  the nation's  third-largest cable  operator,
serves  4.2 million domestic customers, passes  more than seven million domestic
homes and holds  significant other  domestic and international  properties. U  S
WEST will purchase all of Continental's stock for approximately $5.3 billion and
will   assume  Continental's  debt  and   other  obligations,  which  amount  to
approximately $5.5 billion. Consideration  for the $5.3  billion in equity  will
consist  of approximately $1 billion in U S WEST preferred stock, convertible to
Media Stock; and, at U S WEST's  option, between $1 billion and $1.5 billion  in
cash,  and  $2.8  billion  to  $3.3  billion  in  shares  of  Media  Stock.  The
transaction, which  is expected  to close  in  the fourth  quarter of  1996,  is
subject  to  a  number of  conditions  and approvals,  including  approvals from
Continental shareholders and local franchising and government authorities.
 
NOTE 6: INVESTMENT IN TIME WARNER ENTERTAINMENT
    On September 15,  1993, U S  WEST acquired 25.51  percent pro-rata  priority
capital  and  residual  equity  interests ("equity  interests")  in  Time Warner
Entertainment Company  L.P.  ("TWE"  or  "Time  Warner  Entertainment")  for  an
aggregate  purchase price of $2.553 billion. TWE owns and operates substantially
all of the  entertainment assets  previously owned  by Time  Warner Inc.  ("Time
Warner"),  consisting primarily of its filmed entertainment, programming-HBO and
cable businesses.
 
    Upon  U  S  WEST's  admission  to  the  partnership,  certain   wholly-owned
subsidiaries  of Time  Warner ("General  Partners") and  subsidiaries of Toshiba
Corporation and ITOCHU Corporation held  pro-rata priority capital and  residual
equity  interests of 63.27,  5.61 and 5.61 percent,  respectively. In 1995, Time
Warner  acquired   the  limited   partnership  interests   previously  held   by
subsidiaries of each of ITOCHU Corporation and Toshiba Corporation.
 
    U  S  WEST has  an  option to  increase  its pro-rata  priority  capital and
residual equity  interests  in  TWE  from 25.51  percent  up  to  31.84  percent
depending  upon cable operating performance. The option is exercisable, in whole
or part,  between January  1, 1999,  and May  31, 2005,  for an  aggregate  cash
exercise  price ranging from  $1.25 billion to $1.8  billion, depending upon the
year of exercise. Either TWE or U S  WEST may elect that the exercise price  for
the option be paid with partnership interests rather than cash.
 
    Pursuant to the TWE Partnership Agreement, there are four levels of capital.
From  the most to least senior, the capital accounts are: senior preferred (held
by the General Partners); pro-rata priority capital (A

preferred - held pro-rata by the general and limited partners); junior  priority
capital  (B  preferred -  held by  the General  Partners); and  common (residual
equity interests held  pro-rata by  the general  and limited  partners). Of  the
$2.553  billion contributed by  U S WEST, $1.658  billion represents A preferred
capital and  $895  represents  common capital.  The  TWE  Partnership  Agreement
provides  for  special allocations  of income  and distributions  of partnership
capital. Partnership income, to the extent earned, is allocated as follows:  (1)
to  the partners so that  the economic burden of  the income tax consequences of
partnership operations  is  borne as  though  the  partnership was  taxed  as  a
corporation  ("special tax allocations"); (2) to the partners' preferred capital
accounts in  order of  priority  described above,  at  various rates  of  return
ranging from 8 percent to 13.25 percent; and (3) to the partners' common capital
according  to their  residual partnership  interests. To  the extent partnership
income is  insufficient  to satisfy  all  special allocations  in  a  particular
accounting  period, the unearned portion is  carried over until satisfied out of
future partnership income. Partnership losses generally are allocated in reverse
order, first to eliminate prior allocations of partnership income, except senior
preferred and special tax income, next to reduce initial capital amounts,  other
than  senior preferred, then to reduce the senior preferred account and finally,
to eliminate special tax allocations.
 
    A summary of the  contributed capital and priority  capital rates of  return

  The  senior  preferred  is  scheduled  to  be  distributed  in  three   annual
  installments beginning July 1, 1997.
 
(d)
  11.00 percent to the extent concurrently distributed.
 
(e)
  Includes  $300  for  the  September 1995  reacquisition  of  assets previously
  excluded from the partnership (the Time Warner service partnership assets) for
  regulatory reasons.
 
(f)
  11.25 percent to the extent concurrently distributed.
 
    Cash distributions are required to be made to the partners to permit them to
pay income taxes at statutory rates based on their allocable taxable income from
TWE ("Tax Distributions").  The aggregate  amount of such  Tax Distributions  is
computed  generally by reference to the taxes  that TWE would have been required
to pay if it  were a corporation. Tax  Distributions were previously subject  to
restrictions  until July  1995, and are  now paid  to the partners  on a current
basis. For  distributions  other than  those  related  to taxes  or  the  senior
preferred,  the  TWE Partnership  Agreement  requires certain  cash distribution
thresholds be met to  the limited partners before  the General Partners  receive
their  full share of distributions. No cash  distributions have been made to U S
WEST.

               NOTES TO COMBINED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)
 
NOTE 6: INVESTMENT IN TIME WARNER ENTERTAINMENT (CONTINUED)
    U  S WEST  accounts for  its investment  in TWE  under the  equity method of
accounting. The  excess  of fair  market  value over  the  book value  of  total
partnership  net  assets  implied by  U  S  WEST's initial  investment  was $5.7
billion. This excess is being amortized on a straight-line basis over 25  years.
The  Media Group's recorded share of  TWE operating results represents allocated
TWE net income  or loss  adjusted for  the amortization  of the  excess of  fair
market  value over the book value of the  partnership net assets. As a result of
this amortization and the special income allocations described above, the  Media
Group's recorded pretax share of TWE operating results before extraordinary item
was  $(31), $(18) and $(20)  in 1995, 1994 and  1993, respectively. In addition,
TWE recorded an extraordinary loss for the early extinguishment of debt in 1995.
The Media Group's share of this extraordinary loss was $4, net of an income  tax
benefit of $2.
 
    As consideration for its expertise and participation in the cable operations
of TWE, the Media Group earns a management fee of $130 over five years, which is
payable  over a four-year period beginning in  1995. Management fees of $26, $26
and $8 were recorded to other income  in 1995, 1994 and 1993, respectively.  The
Media  Group Combined Balance Sheet  includes a note payable  to TWE of $169 and
$771 and management  fee receivables of  $50 and  $34 at December  31, 1995  and
1994, respectively.

NOTE 6: INVESTMENT IN TIME WARNER ENTERTAINMENT (CONTINUED)
    In early 1995, Time Warner announced its intention to simplify its corporate
structure by establishing an enterprise that will be responsible for the overall
management  and financing  of the  cable and  telecommunications properties. Any
change in the structure of TWE would require U S WEST's approval in addition  to
certain creditors' and regulatory approvals.
 
CONTINGENCIES
 
    On  September 22, 1995, U S WEST  filed a lawsuit in Delaware Chancery Court
to enjoin the proposed merger of Time  Warner and Turner Broadcasting. U S  WEST
has  alleged  breaches  of  contract  and fiduciary  duties  by  Time  Warner in
connection with this proposed merger. Time Warner filed a countersuit against  U
S  WEST on October 11, 1995,  alleging misrepresentation, breach of contract and
other misconduct on  the part of  U S  WEST. Time Warner's  countersuit seeks  a
reformation  of the  Time Warner  Entertainment partnership  agreement, an order
that enjoins U S WEST from breaching the partnership agreement, and  unspecified
compensatory  damages. U S WEST  has denied each of  the claims in Time Warner's
countersuit. The trial for this action concluded on March 22, 1996. A ruling  by
the Delaware Chancery Court is expected in June 1996.

    In November 1994, TeleWest plc ("TeleWest") made an initial public  offering
of  its ordinary shares. Following the offering, in  which U S WEST sold part of
its 50 percent joint venture interest, U S WEST owned approximately 37.8 percent
of TeleWest. Net proceeds of approximately $650 were used by TeleWest to finance
construction and operating costs, invest in affiliated companies and repay debt.
It is U S WEST's  policy to recognize as income  any gains or losses related  to
the  sale of stock to the  public. The Media Group recognized  a gain of $105 in
1994, net of $59 in  deferred taxes, for the partial  sale of its joint  venture
interest in TeleWest.
 
    On  October 2, 1995, TeleWest and SBC  CableComms (UK) completed a merger of
their UK cable television and telecommunications interests, creating the largest
provider of  combined  cable  and  telecommunications  services  in  the  United
Kingdom.  Following completion of the merger,  U S WEST and Tele-Communications,
Inc., the major shareholders, each own 26.8 percent of the combined company. The
Media Group recognized  a gain of  $95 in 1995,  net of $62  in deferred  income
taxes, in conjunction with the merger.
 
    TeleWest,  which is  the only  equity method  investment for  which a quoted
market price is available, had a market value of $914 at December 31, 1995,  and
$1,004 at December 31, 1994.
 
    FOREIGN  CURRENCY TRANSACTIONS  U S WEST  enters into  forward and zero-cost
combination option contracts to  manage foreign currency  risk. Under a  forward
contract,  U S WEST agrees with another party to exchange a foreign currency and
U.S. dollars at a specified price at a future date. Under combination options, U
S WEST combines purchased options to cap the foreign exchange rate to be paid at
a future  date with  written options  to finance  the premium  of the  purchased
options.  The  commitments, forward  contracts and  combination options  are for
periods up to one year.
 
    Forward exchange contracts are carried at  market value. Gains or losses  on
the  portion of  the contracts  designated as  hedges of  firm equity investment
commitments are deferred as a component of Media Group equity and are recognized
in income upon sale  of the investment.  Gains or losses on  the portion of  the
contracts  designated to offset translation of  investee net income are recorded
in income.
 
    Forward contracts are also  used to hedge  foreign denominated loans.  These
contracts are carried at market value with gains or losses recorded in income.

    During 1993, the  Media Group's wireless  subsidiary replaced  substantially
all  of  its  cellular  network equipment,  consisting  primarily  of  cell site
electronics and switching equipment, in certain of its major market areas.
 
    System   development   costs   includes   the   replacement   of   existing,
single-purpose  systems  used  in  the publishing  businesses  with  new systems
designed to provide integrated, end-to-end customer service. Other costs consist
primarily of employee separation costs including severance payments, health care
coverage and postemployment education benefits  and relocation costs. The  Media
Group  expects the  restructuring to  be substantially  completed by  the end of
1996. Management does not anticipate  any material revisions in total  estimated
expenditures.   However,  should  expenditures  exceed  the  remaining  reserve,
additional amounts would be expensed as incurred.

    The weighted average interest rate on commercial paper was 5.79 percent  and
6.04 at December 31, 1995 and 1994, respectively.
 
    The bank loan, in the translated principal amount of $216, is denominated in
Dutch  guilders.  The  loan was  entered  into  in connection  with  U  S WEST's
investment in a cable  television venture in the  Netherlands and was repaid  in
February 1996.
 
    U  S WEST  maintains a commercial  paper program to  finance short-term cash
flow requirements, as  well as  to maintain a  presence in  the short-term  debt
market.  Additional lines of  credit aggregating approximately  $1.3 billion are
available to the  Media Group as  well as the  nonregulated subsidiaries of  the
Communications  Group in accordance with their  borrowing needs. The Media Group
expects that cash  from operations will  not be adequate  to fund expected  cash
requirements. Additional financing will come primarily from new debt.

    Long-term  debt consists principally of  debentures, medium-term notes, debt
associated with U S WEST's  Leveraged Employee Stock Ownership Plans  ("LESOP"),
and  zero coupon subordinated notes convertible at any time into equal shares of
Communications Stock and  Media Stock.  The zero coupon  notes have  a yield  to
maturity  of approximately 7.3 percent and are recorded at a discounted value of
$245 and $234 at December 31, 1995 and 1994, respectively.

NOTE 11: DEBT (CONTINUED)
    In 1995,  U  S  WEST issued  $130  of  Debt Exchangeable  for  Common  Stock
("DECS"),  due December 15, 1998 in the principal amount of $24.00 per note. The
notes bear interest at 7.625 percent,  of which 1.775 percent has been  included
in  the  assets  held  for  sale  reserve.  Upon  maturity,  each  DECS  will be
mandatorily redeemed by U S WEST for shares of Enhance Financial Services Group,
Inc. ("Enhance") held by U S WEST or  the cash equivalent at U S WEST's  option.
The  number of shares to be delivered at  maturity varies based on the per share
market price of Enhance. If  the market price is $24.00  per share or less,  one
share of Enhance will be delivered for each note; if the market price is between
$24.00 and $28.32 per share, a fractional share equal to $24.00 is delivered; if
the  market value is greater than $28.32  per share, .8475 shares are delivered.
The capital  assets segment  currently owns  approximately 31.5  percent of  the
outstanding Enhance common stock.
 
    At  December 31, 1995, U  S WEST guaranteed debt  in the principal amount of
approximately $140, primarily related to international ventures.
 
    Interest payments, net of amounts capitalized, were $140, $167 and $272  for
1995,  1994 and 1993,  respectively, of which $87,  $134 and $272, respectively,
relate to the capital assets segment.
 
INTEREST RATE RISK MANAGEMENT
 
    Interest rate  swap  agreements are  used  to effectively  convert  existing
commercial  paper to fixed-rate debt.  This allows U S  WEST to achieve interest
savings over issuing fixed-rate debt directly.
 
    Under an interest rate swap, U S WEST agrees with another party to  exchange
interest  payments at specified intervals over a defined term. Interest payments
are calculated  by reference  to the  notional amount  based on  the fixed-  and
variable-rate terms of the swap agreements. The net interest received or paid as
part  of the interest  rate swap is  accounted for as  an adjustment to interest
expense.
 
    The following table summarizes terms of swaps. Variable rates are indexed to
the 30-day commercial paper rate.

    The counterparties  to these  interest rate  contracts are  major  financial
institutions.  The  Media  Group is  exposed  to  credit loss  in  the  event of
nonperformance by  these  counterparties. U  S  WEST manages  this  exposure  by
monitoring  the credit standing of the  counterparty and establishing dollar and
term limitations  which  correspond to  the  respective credit  rating  of  each
counterparty.  U  S WEST  does not  have significant  exposure to  an individual
counterparty and does not anticipate nonperformance by any counterparty.
 
NOTE 12: FAIR VALUES OF FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS
    Fair values  of  cash  equivalents, other  current  amounts  receivable  and
payable, and short-term debt approximate carrying values due to their short-term
nature.
 
    The  fair  values of  mandatorily redeemable  preferred stock  and long-term
receivables, based on  discounting future cash  flows, approximate the  carrying
values. The fair value of foreign exchange contracts, based on estimated amounts
U  S WEST  would receive  or pay to  terminate such  agreements, approximate the
carrying values. It is not practicable  to estimate the fair value of  financial
guarantees  associated with international operations because there are no quoted
market prices for similar transactions.

NOTE 14: COMPANY-OBLIGATED MANDATORILY REDEEMABLE PREFERRED SECURITIES
        OF SUBSIDIARY TRUST HOLDING SOLELY COMPANY-GUARANTEED DEBENTURES
    On September 11, 1995, U S WEST Financing I, a wholly owned subsidiary of  U
S  WEST ("Financing  I"), issued $600  million of 7.96  percent Trust Originated
Preferred Securities (the "Preferred Securities") and $19 of common  securities.
U  S  WEST  holds all  of  the  outstanding common  securities  of  Financing I.
Financing I used  the proceeds  from such  issuance to  purchase from  U S  WEST
Capital  Funding,  Inc.,  a  wholly  owned  subsidiary  of  U  S  WEST ("Capital
Funding"), $619 principal amount of Capital Funding's 7.96 percent  Subordinated
Deferrable  Interest Notes  due 2025  (the "Subordinated  Debt Securities"), the
obligations under which  are fully and  unconditionally guaranteed by  U S  WEST
(the  "Debt Guarantee").  The sole  assets of  Financing I  are and  will be the
Subordinated Debt Securities and the Debt Guarantee.
 
    In addition, U S WEST has guaranteed the payment of interest and  redemption
amounts  to holders of Preferred Securities when Financing I has funds available
for such  payments  (the  "Payment  Guarantee") as  well  as  Capital  Funding's
undertaking  to pay all  of Financing I's costs,  expenses and other obligations
(the "Expense Undertaking"). The Payment Guarantee and the Expense  Undertaking,
including  U S WEST's  guarantee with respect  thereto, considered together with
Capital  Funding's  obligations  under  the  indenture  and  Subordinated   Debt
Securities  and U S WEST's obligations under the indenture, declaration and Debt
Guarantee, constitute  a  full  and  unconditional guarantee  by  U  S  WEST  of
Financing I's obligations under the Preferred Securities. The interest and other
payment dates on the Subordinated Debt Securities correspond to the distribution
and   other   payment  dates   on  the   Preferred  Securities.   Under  certain
circumstances, the  Subordinated  Debt  Securities may  be  distributed  to  the
holders  of  Preferred  Securities  and  common  securities  in  liquidation  of

    U S WEST has issued 392,000 shares of Media Stock since the November 1, 1995
recapitalization and has 472,314,000 shares outstanding at December 31, 1995.
 
    Included   in  Media  Group  equity   is  the  cumulative  foreign  currency
translation adjustment of $(38), $(29) and $(35) at December 31, 1995, 1994  and

LEVERAGED EMPLOYEE STOCK OWNERSHIP PLAN ("LESOP")
 
    The  Media Group  and the  Communications Group  participate in  the defined
contribution savings plan sponsored  by U S WEST.  Employees of the Media  Group
are  covered  by  the  plan  except for  Atlanta  Systems  and  foreign national
employees. U S WEST matches a percentage of eligible employee contributions with
shares of Media Stock and/or Communications Stock in accordance with participant
elections. Participants may also elect to reallocate past company  contributions
between  Media Stock and Communications Stock. In 1989, U S WEST established two
LESOPs to provide Company stock for matching contributions to the savings  plan.
Shares in the LESOP are released as principal and interest are paid on the debt.
At  December 31, 1995, 10,145,485 shares  each of Media Stock and Communications
Stock had been allocated from the LESOP to participants accounts while 2,839,435
shares each of Media Stock and Communications Stock remained unallocated.
 
    The  borrowings  associated  with  the  LESOP,  which  are   unconditionally
guaranteed  by U S WEST,  are included in the  accompanying Media Group Combined
Financial Statements. Contributions from the Communications Group and the  Media
Group  as well as dividends on unallocated shares held by the LESOP ($8, $11 and
$14 in 1995, 1994, and 1993, respectively) are used for debt service.  Beginning
with the dividend paid in fourth-quarter 1995, dividends on allocated shares are
being  paid annually to participants.  Previously, dividends on allocated shares
were used for debt  service with participants  receiving additional shares  from
the  LESOP. Tax benefits related to dividend  payments on eligible shares in the
savings plan have  been allocated to  the Communications Group,  which paid  the
dividends.
 
    U S WEST recognizes expense based on the cash payments method. Contributions
to  the plan related to the Media Group were  $16, $12, and $7 in 1995, 1994 and
1993, respectively, of which $3, $3  and $4, respectively, have been  classified
as interest expense.
 
NOTE 17: STOCK INCENTIVE PLANS
    U  S WEST maintains stock incentive  plans for executives and key employees,
and nonemployees.  The Amended  1994 Stock  Plan (the  "Plan") was  approved  by
shareowners  on October 31,  1995 in connection  with the Recapitalization Plan.
The Plan is a successor plan to the U S WEST, Inc. Stock Incentive Plan and  the
U  S WEST 1991 Stock Incentive Plan (the "Predecessor Plans"). No further grants

restricted  stock  may  be  made  under  the  Predecessor  Plans.  The  Plan  is
administered  by the  Human Resources Committee  of the board  of directors with
respect to officers, executive officers and  outside directors and by a  special
committee   with  respect   to  all   other  eligible   employees  and  eligible
nonemployees.
 
    During calendar  year 1995,  up  to 1,485,000  shares  of Media  Stock  were
available  for grant. The maximum aggregate number of shares of Media Stock that
may be granted in  any other calendar  year for all purposes  under the Plan  is
three-quarters  of  one  percent (0.75  percent)  of  the shares  of  such class
outstanding (excluding shares held in the  Company's treasury) on the first  day
of such calendar year. In the event that fewer than the full aggregate number of
shares of either class available for issuance in any calendar year are issued in
any  such year, the shares not issued shall be added to the shares of such class
available for issuance in any subsequent year or years. Options may be exercised
no later than 10 years after the date on which the option was granted.

NOTE 18: EMPLOYEE BENEFITS
 
PENSION PLAN
 
    The  Communications Group  and the  Media Group  participate in  the defined
benefit pension plan sponsored by U S WEST. The employees of the Media Group are
covered by the plan except for  Atlanta Systems and foreign national  employees.
Since  plan assets  are not segregated  into separate accounts  or restricted to
providing benefits to employees of  the Media Group, assets  of the plan may  be
used  to provide benefits to employees of  both the Communications Group and the
Media Group. In the event the single employer pension plan sponsored by U S WEST
would be separated into  two or more plans,  guidelines in the Internal  Revenue
Code dictate how assets of the plan must be allocated to the new plans. U S WEST
currently  has no intentions  to split the  plan. Because of  these factors, U S
WEST believes there is no reasonable basis to attribute plan assets to the Media
Group as if they had funded separately their actuarially determined obligation.
 
    Management benefits  are based  on a  final pay  formula while  occupational
benefits  are based on a flat benefit formula.  U S WEST uses the projected unit
credit method  for the  determination of  pension cost  for financial  reporting
purposes  and  the aggregate  cost method  for  funding purposes.  The Company's
policy is to fund amounts required under the Employee Retirement Income Security
Act of 1974 ("ERISA") and no funding was required in 1995, 1994 or 1993.  Should
funding  be required in  the future, funding  amounts would be  allocated to the
Media Group based upon  the ratio of  service cost of the  Media Group to  total
service cost of plan participants.
 
    The composition of the net pension cost and the actuarial assumptions of the
plan follow:

    Anticipated  future  benefit  changes  have  been  reflected  in  the  above

    ALLOCATION  OF PENSION COSTS   U S WEST's allocation  policy is to 1) offset
the company-wide service cost, interest cost and amortizations by the return  on
plan  assets; and 2) allocate the remaining  net pension cost to the Media Group
based on the ratio of actuarially determined service cost of the Media Group  to
total  service  cost of  plan  participants. U  S  WEST believes  allocating net
pension cost based on service cost is reasonable since service cost is a primary
factor in determining  pension cost. Net  pension costs allocated  to the  Media
Group were $0, $0 and $(9) in 1995, 1994 and 1993, respectively. The service and
interest  costs for  1995 and the  projected benefit obligation  at December 31,
1995 attributed to the Media Group were $24, $29 and $429, respectively.
 
POSTRETIREMENT BENEFITS OTHER THAN PENSIONS
 
    The Communications Group and the Media Group participate in plans  sponsored
by  U S WEST  which provide certain  health care and  life insurance benefits to
retired employees. In conjunction with the  Company's 1992 adoption of SFAS  No.
106,  "Employers' Accounting  for Postretirement Benefits  Other Than Pensions,"
the Company  elected to  immediately  recognize the  accumulated  postretirement
benefit obligation for current and future retirees.
 
    U  S WEST  uses the  projected unit credit  method for  the determination of
postretirement medical  and life  costs for  financial reporting  purposes.  The
composition  of  net  postretirement  benefit  costs  and  actuarial assumptions
underlying plan benefits follow:

- ------------------------------
* Medical cost trend rate gradually declines to an ultimate rate of 5 percent in
  2011.
 
    A  one-percent increase in the assumed health  care cost trend rate for each
future year would have increased the aggregate of the service and interest  cost
components  of 1995  net postretirement  benefit cost  by approximately  $40 and
increased  the   1995   accumulated   postretirement   benefit   obligation   by
approximately $350.
 
    Anticipated   future   benefit  changes   have   been  reflected   in  these
postretirement benefit calculations.
 
    PLAN ASSETS  Assets of the postretirement medical and life plans may be used
to provide benefits to employees of both the Communications Group and the  Media
Group  since plan  assets are  not legally  restricted to  providing benefits to
either Group. In  the event  that either  plan sponsored by  U S  WEST would  be
separated  into  two or  more plans,  there  are no  guidelines in  the Internal
Revenue Code for allocating assets  of the plan. U  S WEST allocates the  assets
based  on historical contributions for postretirement  medical costs, and on the
ratio of  salaries  for  life plan  participants.  U  S WEST  currently  has  no
intention to split the plans.
 
    POSTRETIREMENT  MEDICAL COSTS   The service  and interest  components of net
postretirement medical benefit costs  are calculated for  the Media Group  based
upon   the   population  characteristics   of  the   Group.  Since   funding  of
postretirement medical costs is voluntary, return on assets is attributed to the
Media Group  based upon  historical funding.  The Media  Group has  historically
funded  the maximum annual tax  deductible contribution for management employees
and the amount  of annual expense  for occupational employees.  The Media  Group
periodically  reviews its funding  strategy and future  funding amounts, if any,
will be based upon the cash requirements of the Group.

               NOTES TO COMBINED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (CONTINUED)
 
NOTE 18: EMPLOYEE BENEFITS (CONTINUED)
    Net postretirement medical benefit costs  recognized by the Media Group  for
1995,  1994 and  1993 were  $14, $11  and $11,  respectively. The  percentage of
postretirement medical assets attributed to the Media Group at December 31, 1995
and 1994, based upon  historical voluntary contributions, was  4 and 5  percent,
respectively.   The  accumulated   postretirement  medical   benefit  obligation
attributed to the Media Group was $161 at December 31, 1995.
 
    ALLOCATION OF POSTRETIREMENT LIFE COSTS   Net postretirement life costs, and
funding requirements,  if any,  are allocated  to the  Media Group  in the  same
manner  as pensions.  U S WEST  will generally  fund the amount  allowed for tax
purposes and no funding of postretirement life insurance occurred in 1995,  1994
and  1993. U S WEST believes its  method of allocating postretirement life costs
is reasonable.
 
    Net postretirement life benefit costs allocated to the Media Group for 1995,
1994 and 1993 were $0, $3, and $3, respectively. The service and interest  costs
for  1995 and the accumulated postretirement life benefit obligation at December
31, 1995 attributed to the Media Group were $1, $3 and $45, respectively.

    The  current portion of the  deferred tax asset was  $24 and $52 at December
31, 1995 and 1994, respectively, resulting primarily from restructuring  charges
and compensation-related items.
 
    The  net  deferred tax  liability includes  $686  in 1995  and $678  in 1994
related to the capital assets segment.
 
NOTE 20: NET INVESTMENT IN ASSETS HELD FOR SALE
    The  Combined  Financial   Statements  of  the   Media  Group  include   the
discontinued operations of the capital assets segment. During the second quarter
of  1993, the  U S WEST  Board of  Directors approved a  plan to  dispose of the
capital assets  segment  through the  sale  of segment  assets  and  businesses.
Accordingly,  the  Media Group  recorded  an after-tax  charge  of $100  for the
estimated loss on disposition. An additional provision of $20 is related to  the
effect  of the  1993 increase  in federal income  tax rates.  The capital assets
segment  includes  activities  related  to  financial  services  and   financial
guarantee  insurance operations. Also included  in the segment is  U S WEST Real
Estate, Inc., for which disposition was  announced in 1991 and a $500  valuation
allowance was established to cover both carrying costs and losses on disposal of
related properties.

                              U S WEST MEDIA GROUP
               NOTES TO COMBINED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (CONTINUED)
 
NOTE 20: NET INVESTMENT IN ASSETS HELD FOR SALE (CONTINUED)
    Effective January 1, 1995, the capital assets segment has been accounted for
in  accordance with Staff  Accounting Bulletin No. 93,  issued by the Securities
Exchange Commission,  which requires  discontinued  operations not  disposed  of
within  one year of  the measurement date  to be accounted  for prospectively in
continuing operations as  a "net investment  in assets held  for sale." The  net
realizable  value  of  the  assets  is  reevaluated  on  an  ongoing  basis with
adjustments to the existing reserve,  if any, charged to continuing  operations.
No  such adjustment was required  in 1995. Prior to  January 1, 1995, the entire
capital  assets  segment  was  accounted  for  as  discontinued  operations   in
accordance with Accounting Principles Board Opinion No. 30.
 
    During  1994, U S WEST reduced  its ownership interest in Financial Security
Assurance Holdings, Ltd.  ("FSA"), a member  of the capital  assets segment,  to
60.9  percent,  and its  voting interest  to  49.8 percent  through a  series of
transactions. In May and  June 1994, U  S WEST sold 8.1  million shares of  FSA,
including  2  million shares  sold to  Fund  American Enterprises  Holdings Inc.
("FFC"), in an initial public  offering of FSA common  stock. U S WEST  received
$154  in net proceeds from the offering.  The Media Group retained certain risks
in asset-backed obligations related to the commercial real estate portfolio.  On
September 2, 1994, U S WEST issued to FFC 50,000 shares of cumulative redeemable
preferred  stock for  a total  of $50.  (See Note  15 to  the Combined Financial
Statements.) In December 1995, FSA merged with Capital Guaranty Corporation  for
shares  of FSA and cash of $51. The transaction was valued at approximately $203
and reduced U S WEST's ownership interest in FSA to 50.3 percent and its  voting
interest to 41.7 percent. U S WEST expects to monetize and ultimately reduce its
ownership  in FSA  through the  issuance of  Debt Exchangeable  for Common Stock
("DECS") in 1996. At maturity,  each DECS will be  mandatorily exchanged by U  S
WEST  for shares of FSA common stock held by  U S WEST or, at U S WEST's option,
redeemed at the cash equivalent.
 
    U S WEST  entered into  a transaction to  reduce its  investment in  Enhance
Financial  Services Group, Inc. ("Enhance") during fourth-quarter 1995. U S WEST
issued DECS due December 15, 1998. Upon maturity, each DECS will be  mandatorily
exchanged  by U  S WEST for  shares of  Enhance Common Stock  or, at  U S WEST's
option, redeemed at the  cash equivalent. The  capital assets segment  currently
owns  approximately 31.5 percent  of the outstanding  Enhance common stock. (See
Note 11 to the Combined Financial Statements.)
 
    U S WEST Real Estate, Inc.  has sold various properties totaling $120,  $327
and  $66 in each of  the three years ended  December 31, 1995, respectively. The
sales proceeds were in  line with estimates. Proceeds  from building sales  were
primarily  used to repay  related debt. U  S WEST has  completed construction of
existing buildings  in  the commercial  real  estate portfolio  and  expects  to
substantially  complete the liquidation of this portfolio by 1998. The remaining
balance of assets subject to sale is approximately $490, net of reserves, as  of
December 31, 1995.
 
    In  December 1993, U S WEST sold $2.0 billion of finance receivables and the
business of U S WEST Financial Services, Inc. to NationsBank Corporation.  Sales
proceeds  of $2.1 billion were used primarily  to repay related debt. The pretax
gain on the sale  of approximately $100,  net of selling  expenses, was in  line
with  management's estimate  and was included  in the Media  Group's estimate of
provision for loss on disposal. The management team that previously operated the
entire capital assets segment transferred to NationsBank.
 
    Building sales and  operating revenues  of the capital  assets segment  were
$237,  $553  and  $710  in  1995,  1994  and  1993,  respectively.  Income  from
discontinued operations for 1993 (to June 1) totaled $38. Income (loss) from the
capital assets  segment subsequent  to June  1, 1993  is being  deferred and  is
included within the reserve for assets held for sale.
 
    The  assets  and  liabilities  of  the  capital  assets  segment  have  been
separately classified on the Combined Balance Sheets as net investment in assets
held for sale.

    Finance receivables  primarily  consist  of  contractual  obligations  under
long-term  leases  that U  S WEST  intends  to run  off. These  long-term leases
consist mostly of  leveraged leases related  to aircraft and  power plants.  For
leveraged  leases, the cost  of the assets leased  is financed primarily through
nonrecourse debt which is netted against the related lease receivable.

SUPPLEMENTARY SELECTED PROPORTIONATE RESULTS OF OPERATIONS
 
    The Media Group believes that  proportionate financial data facilitates  the
understanding and assessment of its Combined Financial Statements. The following
proportionate accounting table reflects the relative weight of the Media Group's
ownership  interest in its  domestic and international  investments in cable and
telecommunications, wireless and directory and information services  operations.
The  financial  information  included below  departs  materially  from generally
accepted accounting principles ("GAAP") because  it aggregates the revenues  and
operating income of entities not controlled by the Media Group with those of the
consolidated  operations  of the  Media  Group. This  table  is not  intended to
replace the  Combined Financial  Statements prepared  in accordance  with  GAAP.
Supplemental  Media Group information  on a proportionate  basis is presented in
Management's Discussion and Analysis.

of the entire Board.  Only such business as is specified in the notice of any
special meeting of the stockholders shall come before such meeting.

         SECTION 4.  NOTICE OF MEETINGS.  Except as otherwise provided by law,
written notice of each meeting of the stockholders, whether annual or special,
shall be given, either by personal delivery or by mail, not less than 10 nor

entitled to notice of the meeting.  If mailed, such notice shall be deemed given
when deposited in the United States mail, postage prepaid, directed to the
stockholder at such stockholder's address as it appears on the records of the
Corporation.  Each such notice shall state the place, date and hour of the
meeting, and the purpose or purposes for which the meeting is called.  Notice of
any meeting of stockholders shall not be required to be given to any stockholder

Certificate, the holders of a majority of the votes entitled to be cast by the

stockholders of a particular class shall constitute a quorum for the transaction
of business by such class.

         SECTION 6.  ADJOURNMENTS.  The chairman of the meeting or the holders
of a majority of the votes entitled to be cast by the stockholders who are
present in person or by proxy may adjourn the meeting from time to time whether
or not a quorum is present.  In the event that a quorum does not exist with
respect to any vote to be taken by a particular class, the chairman of the
meeting or the holders of a majority of the votes entitled to be cast by the
stockholders of such class who are present in person or by proxy may adjourn the
meeting with respect to the vote(s) to be taken by such class.  At such
adjourned meeting at which a quorum may be present, any business may be
transacted which might have been transacted at the meeting as originally called.

         SECTION 7.  ORDER OF BUSINESS.  (a)  At each meeting of the
stockholders, the Chairman of the Board or, in the absence of the Chairman of
the Board, such person as shall be selected by the Board shall act as chairman
of the meeting.  The order of business at each such meeting shall be as
determined by the chairman of the meeting.  The chairman of the meeting shall
have the right and authority to prescribe such rules, regulations and procedures
and to do all such acts and things as are necessary or desirable for the proper
conduct of the meeting, including, without limitation, the establishment of
procedures for the maintenance of order and safety, limitations on the time
allotted to questions or comments on the affairs of the Corporation,
restrictions on entry to such meeting after the time prescribed for the
commencement thereof, and the opening and closing of the voting polls.

         (b)  At any annual meeting of stockholders, only such business shall
be conducted as shall have been brought before the annual meeting (i) by or at
the direction of the chairman of the meeting, (ii) pursuant to the notice
provided for in this Section 4 of this Article II or (iii) by any stockholder
who is a holder of record at the time of the giving of such notice provided for
in this Section 7, who is entitled to vote at the meeting and who complies with
the procedures set forth in this Section 7.

         (c)  For business properly to be brought before an annual meeting by a
stockholder, the stockholder must have given timely notice thereof in proper
written form to the Secretary of the Corporation (the "Secretary").  To be
timely, a stockholder's notice must be delivered to or mailed and received at
the principal executive offices of the Corporation not less than 60 days prior
to the date of an annual meeting of stockholders.  To be in proper written form,
a stockholder's notice to the Secretary shall set forth in writing as to each
matter the stockholder proposes to bring before the annual meeting:  (i) a brief
description of the business desired to be brought before the annual meeting and
the reasons for conducting such business at the annual meeting; (ii) the name
and address of the stockholder proposing such business and all persons or
entities acting in concert with the stockholder; (iii) the class and number of
shares of the Corporation which are beneficially owned by the stockholder and
all persons or entities acting in concert with such stockholder; and (iv) any
material interest of the stockholder in such business.  The foregoing notice
requirements shall be deemed satisfied by a stockholder if the stockholder has
notified the Corporation of his or her intention to present a proposal at an
annual meeting and such stockholder's proposal has been included in a proxy
statement that has been prepared by management of the Corporation to solicit
proxies for such annual meeting; PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that if such stockholder
does not appear or send a qualified representative to present such proposal at
such annual meeting, the Corporation need not present such proposal for a vote
at such meeting, notwithstanding that proxies in respect of such vote may have
been received by the Corporation.  Notwithstanding anything in the bylaws to the
contrary, no business shall be conducted at any annual meeting except in
accordance with the procedures set forth in this Section 7.  The chairman of an
annual meeting shall, if the facts warrant, determine that business was not
properly brought before the annual meeting in accordance with the provisions of
this Section 7 and, if the chairman should so determine, the chairman shall so
declare to the annual meeting and any such business not properly brought before
the annual meeting shall not be transacted.

         SECTION 8.  LIST OF STOCKHOLDERS.  It shall be the duty of the
Secretary or other officer who has charge of the stock ledger to prepare and
make, at least 10 days before each meeting of the stockholders, a complete list
of the stockholders entitled to vote thereat, arranged in alphabetical order,
and showing the address of each stockholder and the number of shares registered
in such stockholder's name.  Such list shall be produced and kept available at
the times and places required by law.

         SECTION 9.  VOTING.  (a) Except as otherwise provided by law or by the
Certificate, each stockholder of record of any class or series of capital stock
of the Corporation shall be entitled at each meeting of stockholders to such
number of votes for each share of such stock as may be fixed in the Certificate
or in the resolution or resolutions adopted by the Board providing for the
issuance of such stock, registered in such stockholder's name on the books of
the Corporation:

         (1)  on the date fixed pursuant to Section 6 of Article VII of these
    bylaws as the record date for the determination of stockholders entitled to
    notice of and to vote at such meeting; or

         (2)  if no such record date shall have been so fixed, then at the
    close of business on the day next preceding the day on which notice of such
    meeting is given, or, if notice is waived, at the close of business on the
    day next preceding the day on which the meeting is held.

         (b)  Each stockholder entitled to vote at any meeting of stockholders
may authorize not in excess of three persons to act for such stockholder by
proxy.  Any such proxy shall be delivered to the secretary of such meeting at or
prior to the time designated for holding such meeting.  No such proxy shall be
voted or acted upon after three years from its date, unless the proxy provides

                                   INDEMNIFICATION

         SECTION 1.  SCOPE OF INDEMNIFICATION. (a) The Corporation shall
indemnify an indemnified representative against any liability incurred in
connection with nay proceeding in which the indemnified representative may be
involved as a party or otherwise, by reason of the fact that such person is or
was serving in an indemnified capacity, except to the extent that any such
indemnification against a particular liability is expressly prohibited by
applicable law or where a judgment or other final adjudication adverse to the
indemnified representative establishes, or where the Corporation determines,
that his or her acts or omissions (i) were in breach of such person's duty of
loyalty to the Corporation or its stockholders, (ii) were not in good faith or
involved intentional misconduct or a knowing violation of law, or (iii) resulted
in receipt by such person of an improper personal benefit. The rights granted by
this Article shall not be deemed exclusive of any other rights to which those
seeking indemnification, contribution, or advancement of expenses may be
entitled under any statue, certificate of incorporation, agreement contract of
insurance, vote of stockholders or disinterested directors, or otherwise. The
rights of indemnification and advancement of expenses provided by or granted
pursuant to this Article shall continue as to a person who has ceased to be an
indemnified representative in respect of matters arising prior to such time and
shall inure to the benefit of the heirs, executors, administrators and personal
representatives of such a person.

         (b)  If an indemnified representative is not entitled to
indemnification with respect to a portion of any liabilities to which such
person may be subject, the Corporation shall nonetheless indemnify such
indemnified representative to the maximum extent for the remaining portion of
the liabilities.

         (c)  The termination of a proceeding by judgment, order, settlement,
conviction, or upon a plea of nolo contendere or its equivalent shall not, of
itself, create a resumption that the indemnified representative is not entitled
to indemnification.

         (d)  To the extent permitted by law, the payment of indemnification
provided for by this Article, including the advancement of expenses pursuant to
Section 2 of this Article VI, with respect to proceedings other than those
brought by or in the right of the Corporation, shall be subject to the
conditions that the indemnified representative shall give the Corporation prompt
notice of any proceeding, that the Corporation shall have complete charge of the
defense of such proceeding and the right to select counsel for the indemnified
representative, and that the indemnified representative shall assist and
cooperate fully in all matters respecting the proceeding and its defense or
settlement. The Corporation may waive any or all of the conditions set forth in
the preceding sentence. Any such waiver shall be applicable only to the specific
payment for which the waiver is made and shall not in any way obligate the
Corporation to grant such waiver at any future time. In the event of a conflict
of interest between the indemnified representative and the

                                          13

<PAGE>

Corporation that would disqualify the Corporation's counsel from representing
the indemnified representative under the rules of professional conduct
applicable to attorneys, it shall be the policy of the Corporation to waive any
or all of the foregoing conditions subject to such limitations or conditions as
the Corporation shall deem to be reasonable in the circumstances.

         (e)  For purposes of this Article:

         (1) "indemnified capacity" means any and all past, present, or future
services by an indemnified representative in one or more capacities as a
director, officer, employee, or agent of the Corporation or, at the request of
the Corporation, as a director, officer, employee, agent, fiduciary, or trustee
of another corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust, employee benefit
plan, or other entity or enterprise; any indemnified representative serving an
affiliate of the Corporation in any capacity shall be deemed to be doing so at
the request of the Corporation;

         (2) an "affiliate of the Corporation" means an entity that directly or
indirectly, through one or more intermediaries, controls, or is controlled by,
or is under common control with, the Corporation;

         (3) "indemnified representative" means any and all directors,
officers, and employees of the Corporation and any other person designated as an
indemnified representative by the Board;

         (4) "liability" means any damage, judgment, amount paid in settlement,
fine, penalty, punitive damage, excise tax assessed with respect to an employee
benefit plan, or cost or expense of any nature (including, without limitation,
expert witness fees, costs of investigation, litigation and appeal costs,
attorneys' fees, and disbursements); and

         (5)   "proceeding" means any threatened, pending, or completed action,
suit, appeal, or other proceeding of any nature, whether civil, criminal,
administrative, or investigative, whether formal or informal, whether external
or internal to the Corporation, and whether brought by or in the right of the
Corporation, a class of its security holders or otherwise.

         SECTION 2. ADVANCING EXPENSES.  All reasonable expenses incurred in
good faith by an indemnified representative in advance of the final disposition
of a proceeding described in Section 1 of this Article VI shall be advanced to
the indemnified representative by the Corporation.  Before making any such
advance payment of expenses, the Corporation shall receive an undertaking by or
on behalf of the indemnified representative to repay such amount if it shall
ultimately be determined that such indemnified representative is not entitled to
be indemnified by the Corporation pursuant to this Article VI.  No advance shall
be made by the Corporation if a determination is reasonably and promptly made by
a majority vote of disinterested directors, even if the disinterested directors
constitute less than a quorum, or (if such a quorum is not obtainable or, even

                                          14

<PAGE>

if obtainable, a quorum of disinterested directors so directs) by independent
legal counsel in a written opinion, that, based upon the facts known to the
Board or counsel at the time such determination is made, the indemnified
representative has acted in such a manner as to permit or require the denial of
indemnification pursuant to the provisions of Section 1 of this Article VI.

                                     ARTICLE VII

each class shall be signed by, or in the name of, the Corporation by the
Chairman of the Board or the President, any Vice President and by the Secretary

countersigned by a transfer agent or registrar.  Although any officer, transfer
agent or registrar whose manual or facsimile signature is affixed to such a
certificate ceases to be such officer, transfer agent or registrar before such
certificate has been issued, it may nevertheless be issued by the Corporation
with the same effect as if such officer, transfer agent or registrar were still
such at the date of its issue.

         (b) The stock ledger and blank share certificates shall be kept by the
Secretary or by a transfer agent or by a registrar or by any other officer or
agent designated by the Board.

         SECTION 2. TRANSFER OF SHARES. Transfers of shares of stock of each
class of the Corporation shall be made only on the books of the Corporation by
the holder thereof, or by such holder's attorney thereunto authorized by a power
of attorney duly executed and filed with the Secretary or a transfer agent for
such stock, if any, and on surrender of the certificate or certificates, if any,
for such shares properly endorsed or accompanied by a duly executed stock
transfer power (or by proper evidence of succession, assignment or authority to
transfer) and the payment of any taxes thereon; PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that the
Corporation shall be entitled to recognize and enforce any lawful restriction on
transfer.  The person in whose name shares are registered on the books of the
Corporation shall be deemed the owner thereof for all purposes as regards the
Corporation; PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that whenever any transfer of shares shall be
made for collateral security and not absolutely, and written notice thereof
shall be given to the Secretary or to such transfer agent, such fact shall be
stated in the entry of the transfer.  No transfer of shares shall be valid as
against the Corporation, its stockholders and creditors for any purpose, except
to render the transferee liable for the debts of the Corporation to the extent
provided by law, until it shall have been entered in the stock records of the
Corporation by an entry showing from and to whom transferred.

         SECTION 3. REGISTERED STOCKHOLDERS AND ADDRESSES OF STOCKHOLDERS.  (a)
The Corporation shall be entitled to recognize the exclusive right of a person
registered on its records as the owner of shares of stock to receive dividends
and to vote as such owner, shall be entitled to hold liable for calls and
assessments a person registered on its records as the owner of shares of stock,
and shall not be bound to recognize any equitable or other claim to or interest
in such share or shares of stock on the part of any other person, whether or not
it shall have express or other notice thereof, except as otherwise provided by
the laws of Delaware.

         (b) Each stockholder shall designate to the Secretary or transfer
agent of the Corporation an address at which notices of meetings and all other
corporate notices may be delivered or mailed to such person, and, if any
stockholder shall fail to designate such address, corporate notices may be
delivered to such person by mail directed to such person at such person's post
office address, if any, as the same appears on the stock record books of the
Corporation or at such person's last known post office address.

         SECTION 4. LOST, DESTROYED AND MUTILATED CERTIFICATES.  The
Corporation may issue to any holder of shares of stock the certificate for which
has been lost, stolen, destroyed or mutilated a new certificate or certificates
for shares, upon the surrender of the mutilated certificate or, in the case of
loss, theft or destruction of the certificate, upon satisfactory proof of such
loss, theft or destruction.  The Board, or a committee designated thereby, or
the transfer agents and registrars for the stock, may, in their discretion,
require the owner of the lost, stolen or destroyed certificate, or such person's
legal representative, to give the Corporation a bond in such sum and with such
surety or sureties as they may direct to indemnify the Corporation and said
transfer agents and registrars against any claim that may be made on account of
the alleged loss, theft or destruction of any such certificate or the issuance
of such new certificate.

         SECTION 5. REGULATIONS. The Board may make such additional rules and
regulations as it may deem expedient concerning the issue and transfer of
certificates representing shares of stock of each class of the Corporation and
may make such rules and take such action as it may deem expedient concerning the
issue of certificates in lieu of certificates claimed to have been lost,
destroyed, stolen or mutilated.

         SECTION 6. FIXING DATE FOR DETERMINATION OF STOCKHOLDERS OF RECORD.
In order that the Corporation may determine the stockholders entitled to notice
of or to vote at any meeting of stockholders or any adjournment thereof, or
entitled to receive payment of any dividend or other distribution or allotment
or any rights, or entitled to exercise any rights in respect of any change,
conversion or exchange of stock or for the purpose of any other lawful action,
the Board may fix, in advance, a record date, which shall not be more than 60
nor less than 10 days before the date of such meeting, nor more than 60 days
prior to any other action.  A determination of stockholders entitled to notice
of or to vote at a meeting of the stockholders shall apply to any adjournment of
the meeting; PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that the Board may fix a new record date for the
adjourned meeting.

                                          16

         SECTION 7.  TRANSFER AGENTS AND REGISTRARS.  The Board may appoint, or
authorize any officer or officers to appoint, one or more transfer agents and
one or more registrars.

                                     ARTICLE VIII

                                         SEAL

         The Board shall provide a corporate seal, which shall be in the form
of a circle and shall bear the full name of the Corporation and the words and
figures of "Corporate Seal Delaware", or such other words or figures as the
Board may approve and adopt.  The seal may be used by causing it or a facsimile
thereof to be impressed or affixed or in any other manner reproduced.

                                      AMENDMENTS

         Any bylaw may be adopted, repealed, altered or amended by two-thirds
of the entire Board at any meeting thereof.  The stockholders of the Corporation
shall have the power to amend, alter or repeal any provision of these bylaws
only to the extent and in the manner provided in the Certificate.

                    [FORM OF NON-QUALIFIED STOCK OPTION AGREEMENT]

                                    U S WEST, INC.

                         NON-QUALIFIED STOCK OPTION AGREEMENT

                               [EXECUTIVE HRC VERSION]

    THIS AGREEMENT is made between U S WEST, Inc. (the "Company") and the
Optionee ("Optionee") named in the letter attached to and made part of this
Agreement (the "Letter"), as of the date set forth in the Letter.

    Pursuant to the U S WEST, Inc. 1994 Stock Plan as amended effective
November 1, 1995 (the "Plan"), the Human Resources Committee of the Company's
Board of Directors (the "Committee") has approved the granting to Optionee of an
option to purchase shares of Common Stock (the "Option"), without par value on
the terms and conditions set forth in this Agreement, as a matter of separate
inducement in connection with Optionee's engagement with the Company or a
Related Entity, and not in lieu of salary or other compensation for Optionee's
services.

    In consideration of the foregoing and of the mutual covenants set forth
herein, and other good and valuable consideration, the Company and Optionee
agree as follows:

    1.    INCORPORATION OF PLAN AND DEFINED TERMS. The Option is granted
pursuant to the Plan, the terms of which are incorporated by reference and apply
to this Agreement as if they were fully set forth herein. Terms used in this
Agreement and not otherwise defined shall have the meanings set forth in the
Plan.

    2.  SHARES OPTIONED; OPTION PRICE. Optionee may purchase all or any part
(in whole shares) of an aggregate of the number of shares of Common Stock, at a
purchase price per share (which is not less than the Fair Market Value on the
date of this Agreement) as specified in the Letter, on the terms and conditions
set forth herein.

    3.  OPTION TERM; VESTING; TIMES OF EXERCISE. The Option shall become Vested
in one-third increments upon each of the first three (3) anniversaries following
the date hereof. The vesting on any such increment shall be subject to the
continuous employment of Optionee until the anniversary date on which such
increment is scheduled to vest, and provided further that the Option shall
expire and shall no longer be exercisable following ten (10) years from the date
of this Agreement (the "Expiration Date"). Except as otherwise specifically set
forth below and elsewhere in this Agreement, the Option shall become Vested only
to the extent that the foregoing continuous employment requirement is satisfied,
regardless of the circumstances under which Optionee's employment is terminated.

<PAGE>

         (i) DEATH. In the event of the death of Optionee, the Option shall
    become Vested and the estate of the Optionee shall have the right, at any
    time and from time to time within one year after the date of death or such
    longer period, if any, as the Committee in its sole discretion shall
    determine (but not after the Expiration Date), to exercise all or any
    portion of the Option. 

         (ii) DISABILITY. Except as otherwise set forth in this Agreement, if
    the employment of Optionee is terminated because of Disability, the Option
    shall be retained by Optionee, and the Option, if not then Vested, shall
    become Vested as set forth in the vesting schedule in Paragraph 3 of this
    Agreement. Upon vesting, Optionee shall have the right to exercise the
    Option, at any time and from time to time, but not after the Expiration
    Date.

         (iii) RETIREMENT. Except as otherwise set forth in this Agreement,
    upon Optionee's Retirement, the Option shall be retained by Optionee, and
    the Option, if not then Vested, shall become Vested as set forth in the
    vesting schedule in Paragraph 3 of this Agreement, unless the Committee, in
    its sole discretion, determines otherwise; provided, however, that the
    continuation of vesting shall be contingent upon Optionee's execution and
    delivery to the Company, on or prior to the effective date of Optionee's
    Retirement, of the Company's standard form of "Waiver & Release" of claims,
    available from the Human Resources Department of the Company. Upon vesting,
    Optionee shall have the right to exercise the Option, at any time and from
    time to time, until the Expiration Date, unless otherwise provided in this
    Agreement.

         (iv) OTHER TERMINATION. If Optionee's employment with the Company or a
    Related Entity is terminated for any reason other than for death,
    Disability or Retirement and other than "for cause," as such term is
    defined in the Plan, Optionee shall have the right to exercise all or any
    portion of the Option, if the Option is then Vested, at any time and from
    time to time within ninety (90) days of termination or such other period,
    if any, as the Committee in its sole discretion shall determine (but not
    after the Expiration Date). 

         (v) EXECUTIVE SEVERANCE AGREEMENT. If Optionee has executed an
    Executive Severance Agreement with the Company, the Option will be Vested
    in accordance with the terms of the Executive Severance Agreement if
    Optionee becomes entitled to the receipt of "Severance Benefits," as set
    forth in that Executive Severance Agreement and sixteen (16) days have
    passed following the execution of a standard form of "Waiver & Release" of
    claims and compliance with the "Conditions" by Optionee as set forth in the
    Company's standard Executive Severance Agreement.

         (vi) CHANGE OF CONTROL. Upon the occurrence of a Change of Control,
    the Option shall be Vested immediately. For purposes of this paragraph,
    "Change of Control" shall have the identical meaning as set forth in the
    Change of Control Agreement, if any, that Optionee has executed with the
    Company. To ensure parallel application, for purposes of this paragraph
    only, defined terms contained in the definition of "Change of Control" set
    forth in Optionee's Change of Control Agreement shall have the same meaning
    here as

                                          2

<PAGE>

    set forth in that Change of Control Agreement. If Optionee has not executed
    any such Change of Control Agreement, "Change of Control" shall have the
    identical meaning as set forth in the Plan.

         (vii) TERMINATION FOR CAUSE. Notwithstanding any other provision in
    this Agreement, if Optionee's employment is terminated by the Company or
    any Related Entity "for cause," as such term is defined in the Plan,
    Optionee shall forfeit immediately all rights under the Option except as to
    the shares of Common Stock already purchased prior to such termination. 

    4.  EXERCISE:  PAYMENT FOR AND DELIVERY OF STOCK. The Option may be
exercised only by Optionee or his or her transferee(s) by last will and
testament or the laws of descent and distribution. The Option may be exercised
by giving written notice of exercise to the Company specifying the number of
shares (minimum of 100, unless the unexercised balance of the Option is less
than 100) to be purchased and the total purchase price, accompanied by cashier's
check or other certified funds or shares of Common Stock in payment of the
purchase price. Any shares of Common Stock so tendered shall be valued as of the
Option exercise date. 

    5.  NON-TRANSFERABILITY OF OPTION. The Option is not transferable otherwise
than by last will and testament or the laws of descent and distribution. The
Option shall not be otherwise transferred or assigned, pledged, hypothecated or
otherwise disposed of in any way, whether by operation of law or otherwise, and
shall not be subject to execution, attachment or similar process. The Option
shall not be assignable or transferable pursuant to a domestic relations order.
During the lifetime of Optionee, the Option shall be exercisable only by
Optionee, or Optionee's guardian or legal representative. Upon any attempt to
transfer the Option otherwise than by last will and testament or the laws of
descent and distribution, or to assign, pledge, hypothecate or otherwise dispose
of the Option, or upon the levy of any execution, attachment or similar process
upon the Option, the Option shall immediately terminate and become null and
void. 

    6.   PERFORMANCE FOR COMPETITORS. If at any time following the date of this
Agreement and before the Option is Vested, regardless of whether Optionee has
Retired, Optionee directly or indirectly receives payment for services rendered
to, or is otherwise employed by, any person, firm or corporation that is in
competition with the Company or engaged in providing any goods or services that
are substantially the same as any goods or services provided or under
development by the Company, Optionee immediately shall forfeit all rights under
the Option, unless the Committee in its sole discretion determines otherwise, or
unless Optionee is in full compliance with the Company's Policy on Service on
Outside Boards of Directors, as interpreted solely by the Company's Senior
Management Compliance Committee. If at any time Optionee renders services to or
becomes otherwise employed by any person, firm or corporation that is in
competition with the Company or engaged in providing any goods or services that
are substantially the same as goods or services provided or under development by
the Company, Optionee shall have ninety (90) days after the date of such
employment to exercise any Vested and non-expired Option. Any determination
under this Paragraph 6, including whether a person, firm or corporation is "in
competition with" the Company or providing "substantially the same"

                                          3

<PAGE>

goods or services as the Company provides or is developing, will be subject to
the sole discretion of the Committee or its designee. 

    7. NON-SOLICITATION OF EMPLOYEES. Optionee agrees that he or she will not
for a period of one (1) year immediately following the termination of his or her
employment with the Company for any reason, either on Optionee's own account or
in conjunction with or on behalf of any other person or entity whatsoever,
directly or indirectly induce, solicit, or entice away any person who, at any
time during the three (3) months immediately preceding Optionee's termination of
employment, is a managerial level employee of the Company (including, but not
limited to, any Officer, Executive Director or director-level employee, or any
equivalent or successor term for any such employees). If Optionee engages in any
conduct contrary to the provisions of this Paragraph 7, Optionee shall forfeit
the Option to the extent the Option has not Vested, unless the Committee
determines otherwise. Such forfeiture is in addition to any other remedies
available under law.

    8.  CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION AND TRADE SECRETS Optionee agrees that any
inventions, discoveries, creations (including without limitation software,
writings, drawings and other works), improvements, confidential information or
other intellectual property that he or she may develop or create, or assist in
developing or creating, during his or her employment with the Company, whether
or not patentable or eligible for copyright, that relate to the actual, planned,
or foreseeable business or other activities of the Company, or that result from
his or her work for the Company, are the exclusive property of the Company.
Optionee agrees to disclose promptly such property to the Company and will, both
during and after his or her employment, and without additional compensation,
execute all assignments and other documents and do all things reasonably
necessary to secure and enforce U.S. and foreign intellectual property rights
for the Company, including patents and copyrights. Such forfeiture is in
addition to any other remedies available under law.

    Optionee agrees to hold in a fiduciary capacity for the benefit of the
Company all confidential, legal, financial, marketing, business, technical, or
other information, including specifically but not exclusively, information that
Optionee prepared, caused to be prepared, or received in connection with
Optionee's employment with the Company, such as management and business plans,
business strategies, software, software evaluations, trade secrets, personnel
information, marketing methods and techniques, and any of the above-recited
information as it relates to the Company that shall have been obtained and/or
learned during his or her employment and that shall not be public knowledge.
After termination of Optionee's employment with the Company, Optionee will not,
without prior written consent of the Company, communicate or divulge any such
information, knowledge or data to anyone other than the Company or its
designated representatives. This provision does not apply to (a) information or
knowledge that already is or subsequently may come into the public domain after
the termination of employment other than by way of unauthorized disclosure by
Optionee, or (b) information or knowledge that Optionee is required to disclose
by order of a court or governmental agency after timely notice is provided to
the Company to allow the Company to take legal action with respect to the
matter. If Optionee engages in any conduct contrary to the provisions of this
Paragraph 8, Optionee shall forfeit the Option to the extent the Option has not
Vested, unless the Committee determines otherwise.

                                          4

<PAGE>

    9.  DECISIONS OF COMMITTEE. Any decision, interpretation or other action
made or taken in good faith by the Committee arising out of or in connection
with the Plan or the Option shall be final, binding and conclusive on the
Company and Optionee and any respective heir, executor, administrator, successor
or assign. 

    10.  ARBITRATION. Any claim, controversy or dispute between Optionee and
the Company, whether sounding in contract, statute, tort, fraud,
misrepresentation, discrimination or any other legal theory, including, but not
limited to, disputes relating to the interpretation of this Agreement; claims
under Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, as amended; claims under the
Civil Rights Act of 1991; claims under the Age Discrimination in Employment Act
of 1967, as amended; claims under 42 U.S.C. Section 1981, Section 1981a,
Section 1983, Section 1985, or Section 1988; claims under the Family and Medical
Leave Act of 1993; claims under the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990, as
amended; claims under the Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938, as amended; claims
under the Employees Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, as amended; claims
under the Colorado Anti-Discrimination Act; or claims under any other similar
federal, state or local law or regulation, whenever brought, shall be resolved
by arbitration. The only legal claims between Optionee and the Company that are
not included for arbitration within this Agreement are claims by Optionee for
workers' compensation or unemployment compensation benefits and/or claims for
benefits under any Company benefit plan, if the plan does not provide for
arbitration of such disputes. BY SIGNING THIS AGREEMENT, OPTIONEE VOLUNTARILY,
KNOWINGLY AND INTELLIGENTLY WAIVES ANY RIGHT HE OR SHE MAY OTHERWISE HAVE TO
SEEK REMEDIES IN COURT OR OTHER FORUMS, INCLUDING THE RIGHT TO A JURY TRIAL AND
THE RIGHT TO RECOVER PUNITIVE DAMAGES ON ANY COMMON LAW AND/OR CONTRACT CLAIMS.
The Federal Arbitration Act, 9 U.S.C. Sections  1-16 ("FAA") shall govern the
arbitrability of all claims, provided that they are enforceable under the FAA,
as it may be amended from time to time. In the event the FAA does not govern,
the Colorado Uniform Arbitration Act shall apply. Additionally, the substantive
law of Colorado, to the extent it is consistent with the terms stated in this
Agreement for arbitration, shall apply to any common law claims. This Agreement
for arbitration supersedes any other arbitration agreement between Optionee and
the Company to the extent they are inconsistent.

         A single arbitrator engaged in the practice of law shall conduct the
arbitration under the applicable rules and procedures of the American
Arbitration Association ("AAA"). Any dispute, that relates directly or
indirectly to Optionee's employment with the Company or to the termination of
Optionee's employment will be conducted under the AAA Employment Dispute
Resolution Rules, effective November 1993. The arbitrator shall be chosen from a
state other than Optionee's state of residence and other than Colorado. Other
than as set forth herein, the arbitrator shall have no authority to add to,
detract from, change, amend, or modify existing law. All arbitration
proceedings, including without limitation, settlements and awards, under this
Agreement will be confidential. The parties shall share equally the hourly fees
of the arbitrator. The Company shall pay the expenses (such as travel and
lodging) of the arbitrator. The prevailing party in any arbitration may be
entitled to receive reasonable attorneys' fees. The arbitrator's decision and
award shall be final and binding, as to all claims that were, or could have
been, raised in the arbitration, and judgment upon the award rendered by the
arbitrator may be entered to any court having jurisdiction thereof. If any party
hereto files a judicial or administrative action asserting claims subject to
this arbitration provision, and another party

                                          5

<PAGE>

successfully stays such action and/or compels arbitration of such claims, the
party filing said action shall pay the other party's costs and expenses incurred
in seeking such stay and/or compelling arbitration, including reasonable
attorneys' fees.

    11.  MISCELLANEOUS.  

         (i) NOTICES. Any notice to be given to the Company shall be personally
delivered to or addressed to its Vice President - Law & Human Resources, and any
notice to be given to Optionee shall be addressed to him or her at the address
given beneath his or her signature below or such other address as the Company
reasonably believes to be his or her most current address. Any notice to the
Company is deemed given when received on behalf of the Company by the Vice
President - Law & Human Resources, of the Company at 188 Inverness Drive West,
Suite 800, Englewood, Colorado 80112. Any notice to Optionee is deemed given
when personally delivered or enclosed in a properly sealed envelope addressed as
aforesaid and deposited, postage prepaid, in a post office or branch post office
regularly maintained by the United States Postal Service. 

              (II) EMPLOYMENT. THE COMPANY MAY TERMINATE OPTIONEE'S EMPLOYMENT
AT ANY TIME, WITH OR WITHOUT CAUSE, UNLESS THE TERM OF EMPLOYMENT IS COVERED BY
SEPARATE CONDITIONS CONTAINED IN ANOTHER AUTHORIZED WRITTEN AGREEMENT SIGNED BY
BOTH PARTIES, AND NOTHING CONTAINED IN THIS AGREEMENT CREATES OR IMPLIES AN
EMPLOYMENT CONTRACT OR TERM OF EMPLOYMENT OR ANY PROMISE OF SPECIFIC TREATMENT
UPON WHICH THE OPTIONEE MAY RELY. 

         (iii) GOVERNING LAW. This Agreement shall be construed and enforced in
accordance with the laws of the State of Colorado. 

         (iv) AMENDMENTS. The Company may at any time propose to amend this
Agreement, but any such alteration or amendment shall be effective only if in
writing, signed by a duly authorized officer of the Company and by Optionee.

                         [FORM OF RESTRICTED STOCK AGREEMENT]

                                    U S WEST, INC.

                              RESTRICTED STOCK AGREEMENT

    THIS AGREEMENT is entered into between U S WEST, Inc. (the "Company") and
the Grantee ("Grantee") named in the Letter attached hereto and made a part of
this Agreement (the "Letter"), as of the date set forth in the Letter.

    Pursuant to the U S WEST, Inc. 1994 Stock Plan as amended effective
November 1, 1995 (the "Plan"), the Human Resources Committee of the Board of
Directors (the "Committee") has granted to Grantee restricted shares of Common
Stock ("Restricted Shares") on the terms and conditions set forth in this
Agreement, as a matter of separate inducement in connection with Grantee's
engagement with the Company or a Related Entity, and not in lieu of salary or
other compensation for Grantee's services.

    In consideration of the foregoing and of the mutual covenants set forth
herein and other good and valuable consideration, the Company and Grantee agree
as follows:

    1.  INCORPORATION OF PLAN AND DEFINED TERMS.  The Restricted Stock is
granted pursuant to the Plan, the terms of which are incorporated by reference
and apply to this Agreement as though they were fully set forth herein.  Terms
used in this Agreement and not otherwise defined shall have the meanings set
forth in the Plan.

    2.  GRANT OF RESTRICTED STOCK.  On the terms and conditions set forth in
this Agreement, the Company hereby grants to Grantee the aggregate number of
shares of Restricted Stock set forth in the Letter.

    3.  RESTRICTED PERIOD.  The Restricted Stock shall become Vested in
accordance with the schedule set forth in the Letter (the "Restricted Period").
Except as specifically set forth below and elsewhere in this Agreement, the
Restricted Stock shall not become Vested before the expiration of the Restricted
Period, regardless of the circumstances under which Grantee's employment is
terminated, and the Restricted Stock shall consequently remain subject to
forfeiture during the Restricted Period.

         (i)  DEATH.  In the event of the death of Grantee, the Restricted
Stock shall no longer be subject to any restriction and shall be Vested
immediately.


<PAGE>

         (ii)  DISABILITY.  Except as otherwise set forth in this Agreement, if
Grantee's employment with the Company or a Related Entity is terminated because
of Disability, the Restricted Stock shall no longer be subject to any
restriction and shall be Vested immediately.

         (iii)  RETIREMENT.  Except as otherwise set forth in this Agreement,
if the Restricted Stock is not Vested upon Grantee's Retirement, the Restricted
Period shall continue and all restrictions respecting such Restricted Stock
shall lapse as of the date(s) such Restricted Stock is scheduled to Vest, unless
the Committee, in its sole discretion, determines otherwise.  The continuation
of the Restricted Period after Retirement shall be contingent upon Grantee's
execution and delivery to the Company, on or prior to the effective date of
Grantee's Retirement, of the Company's standard form of "Waiver & Release" of
claims, available from the Human Resources Department of the Company.

         (iv)  OTHER TERMINATION.  If Grantee's employment with the Company or
a Related Entity is terminated for any reason other than for death, Disability,
or Retirement, the Restricted Stock shall be forfeited immediately unless (i)
such forfeiture is contrary to the terms of an Executive Severance Agreement
executed by Grantee and an authorized officer of the Company, or (ii) the
Committee, in its sole discretion, determines that such Restricted Stock then is
Vested or sets alternative terms on which such Restricted Stock may become
Vested.

         (v)  EXECUTIVE SEVERANCE AGREEMENT.  If Grantee has executed an
Executive Severance Agreement with the Company, the restrictions on the
Restricted Stock will lapse in accordance with the terms of the Executive
Severance Agreement if Grantee becomes entitled to the receipt of "Severance
Benefits," as set forth in that Executive Severance Agreement and sixteen (16)
days have passed following the execution of the Company's standard "Waiver &
Release" of claims and compliance with the "Conditions" by Grantee as set forth
in that Executive Severance Agreement.

         (vi)  CHANGE OF CONTROL.  Upon the occurrence of a Change of Control,
the Restricted Stock shall no longer be subject to restrictions and shall be
Vested immediately.  For purposes of this paragraph, "Change of Control" shall
have the identical meaning as set forth in the Change of Control Agreement that
Grantee has executed with the Company, as may be amended with the consent of
both parties.  To ensure parallel application, for purposes of this paragraph
only, defined terms contained in the definition of "Change of Control" set forth
in Grantee's Change of Control Agreement shall have the same meaning here as set
forth in that Change of Control Agreement.  If Grantee has not executed any such
Change of Control Agreement, then "Change of Control" shall have the identical
meaning as set forth in the Plan.

    4.  CUSTODY; VOTING AND DIVIDENDS.  The Company shall hold the Restricted
Stock in an account on behalf of Grantee.  Grantee shall execute and return the
attached Stock Power in favor of the Company, to be exercised by the Company
only in the case of the forfeiture or other return of the Restricted Stock to
the Company as provided in this Agreement.  Grantee shall receive such dividends
as may be declared on such Restricted Stock and shall be entitled to voting
privileges associated with such Restricted Stock.

    5.  NON-TRANSFERABILITY OF RESTRICTED STOCK.  The Restricted Stock is not
transferable other than by last will and testament or the laws of descent and
distribution.  The Restricted Stock shall not be otherwise transferred or
assigned, pledged, hypothecated or otherwise disposed of in any way, whether by
operation of law or otherwise, and shall not be subject to execution, attachment
or similar process.  The Restricted Stock shall not be assignable or
transferable pursuant to a domestic relations order.  Upon any attempt to
transfer the Restricted Stock other than by last will and testament or the laws
of descent and distribution, or to assign, pledge, hypothecate or otherwise
dispose of the Restricted Stock, or upon the levy of any execution, attachment
or similar process upon the Restricted Stock, the Restricted Stock shall be
canceled immediately.

    6.  PERFORMANCE FOR COMPETITORS.  If at any time following the date of this
Agreement and before the Restricted Stock is Vested, whether or not Grantee is
Retired, Grantee directly or indirectly receives payment for services rendered
to, or is otherwise employed by, any person, firm or corporation that is in
competition with the Company or engaged in providing any goods or services that
are substantially the same as goods or services provided or under development by
the Company, Grantee immediately shall forfeit all rights under the Restricted
Stock, unless the Committee in its sole discretion determines otherwise, or
unless Grantee is in full compliance with the Company's Policy on Service on
Outside Boards of Directors, as interpreted solely by the Company's Senior
Management Compliance Committee.  Any determination under this Paragraph 6,
including whether a person, firm or corporation is "in competition with" the
Company or providing "substantially the same" goods or services as the Company
provides or is developing, will be subject to the sole discretion of the
Committee.

    7.  NON-SOLICITATION OF EMPLOYEES.  Grantee agrees that he or she will not
for a period of one (1) year immediately following the termination of his or her
employment with the Company for any reason, either on Grantee's own account or
in conjunction with or on behalf of any other person or entity whatsoever,
directly or indirectly induce, solicit, or entice away any person who is a
managerial level employee of the Company (including, but not limited to, any
Officer, Executive Director or director-level employee, or any equivalent or
successor term for any such employees) at any time during the three (3) months
immediately preceding Grantee's termination of employment.  If Grantee engages
in any conduct contrary to the provisions of this Paragraph 7, Grantee shall
forfeit the Restricted Stock to the extent the Restricted Stock has not Vested,
unless the Committee determines otherwise.  Such forfeiture shall be in addition
to any other remedies available under law.

    8.  CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION AND TRADE SECRETS.  Grantee agrees that any
inventions, discoveries, creations (including without limitation software,
writings, drawings and other works), improvements, confidential information or
other intellectual property that he or she may develop or create, or assist in
developing or creating, during his or her employment with the Company, whether
or not patentable or eligible for copyright, that relate to the actual, planned,
or foreseeable business or other activities of the Company, or that result from
his or her work for the Company, are the exclusive property of the Company.
Grantee agrees to disclose promptly such property to the Company and will, both
during and after his or her employment, and without additional compensation,
execute all assignments and other documents and do all things


                                          3

<PAGE>

reasonably necessary to secure and enforce U.S. and foreign intellectual
property rights for the Company, including patents and copyrights.

    Grantee agrees to hold in a fiduciary capacity for the benefit of the
Company all confidential, legal, financial, marketing, business, technical, or
other information, including specifically but not exclusively, information that
Grantee prepared, caused to be prepared, or received in connection with
Grantee's employment with the Company, such as management and business plans,
business strategies, software, software evaluations, trade secrets, personnel
information, marketing methods and techniques, and any of the above-recited
information as it relates to the Company that shall have been obtained and/or
learned during his or her employment and that shall not be public knowledge.
After termination of Grantee's employment with the Company, Grantee will not,
without prior written consent of the Company, communicate or divulge any such
information, knowledge or data to anyone other than the Company or its
designated representatives.  This provision does not apply to (a) information or
knowledge that already is or subsequently may come into the public domain after
the termination of employment other than by way of unauthorized disclosure by
Grantee, or (b) information or knowledge that Grantee is required to disclose by
order of a court or governmental agency after timely notice is provided to the
Company to allow the Company to take legal action with respect to the matter. If
Grantee engages in any conduct contrary to the provisions of this Paragraph 8,
Grantee shall forfeit the Restricted Stock to the extent the Restricted Stock
has not Vested, unless the Committee determines otherwise.  Such forfeiture
shall be in addition to any other remedies available under law.

    9.  DECISIONS OF COMMITTEE.  Any decision, interpretation or other action
made or taken in good faith by the Committee arising out of or in connection
with the Plan or the Restricted Stock shall be final, binding and conclusive on
the Company and Grantee and any respective heir, executor, administrator,
successor or assign.

    10.  ARBITRATION.  Any claim, controversy or dispute between Grantee and
the Company, whether sounding in contract, statute, tort, fraud,
misrepresentation, discrimination or any other legal theory, including, but not
limited to, disputes relating to the interpretation of this Agreement; claims

Civil Rights Act of 1991; claims under the Age Discrimination in Employment Act

federal, state or local law or regulation, whenever brought, shall be resolved
by arbitration. The only legal claims between Grantee and the Company that are
not included for arbitration within this Agreement are claims by Grantee for
workers' compensation or unemployment compensation benefits and/or claims for
benefits under any Company benefit plan, if the plan does not provide for
arbitration of such disputes. BY SIGNING THIS AGREEMENT, GRANTEE VOLUNTARILY,
KNOWINGLY AND INTELLIGENTLY WAIVES ANY RIGHT HE OR SHE MAY OTHERWISE HAVE TO
SEEK REMEDIES IN COURT OR OTHER FORUMS, INCLUDING THE RIGHT TO A JURY TRIAL AND
THE RIGHT TO RECOVER PUNITIVE DAMAGES ON ANY

COMMON LAW AND/OR CONTRACT CLAIMS. The Federal Arbitration Act, 9 U.S.C.
Sections  1-16 ("FAA") shall govern the arbitrability of all claims, provided
that they are enforceable under the FAA, as it may be amended from time to time.
In the event the FAA does not govern, the Colorado Uniform Arbitration Act shall
apply.  Additionally, the substantive law of Colorado, to the extent it is
consistent with the terms stated in this Agreement for arbitration, shall apply
to any common law claims.  This Agreement for arbitration supersedes any other
arbitration agreement between Grantee and the Company to the extent they are
inconsistent.

         A single arbitrator engaged in the practice of law shall conduct the
arbitration under the applicable rules and procedures of the American
Arbitration Association ("AAA").  Any dispute, that relates directly or
indirectly to Grantee's employment with the Company or to the termination of
Grantee's employment will be conducted under the AAA Employment Dispute
Resolution Rules, effective November, 1993.  The arbitrator shall be chosen from
a state other than Grantee's state of residence and other than Colorado.  Other
than as set forth herein, the arbitrator shall have no authority to add to,
detract from, change, amend, or modify existing law.  All arbitration
proceedings, including without limitation, settlements and awards, under this
Agreement will be confidential.  The parties shall share equally the hourly fees
of the arbitrator.  The Company shall pay the expenses (such as travel and
lodging) of the arbitrator. The prevailing party in any arbitration may be
entitled to receive reasonable attorneys' fees. The arbitrator's decision and
award shall be final and binding, as to all claims that were, or could have
been, raised in the arbitration, and judgment upon the award rendered by the
arbitrator may be entered to any court having jurisdiction thereof.  If any
party hereto files a judicial or administrative action asserting claims subject
to this arbitration provision, and another party successfully stays such action
and/or compels arbitration of such claims, the party filing said action shall
pay the other party's costs and expenses incurred in seeking such stay and/or
compelling arbitration, including reasonable attorneys' fees.

    11.  MISCELLANEOUS.

         (i)  NOTICES.  Any notice to be given to the Company shall be
personally delivered to or addressed to its Vice President - Law and Human
Resources, and any notice to be given to Grantee shall be addressed to him/her
at the address given beneath his/her signature below, or such other address as
the Company reasonably believes to be his/her most current address.  Any notice
to the Company is deemed given when received on behalf of the Company by its
Vice President - Law and Human Resources at 188 Inverness Drive West, Suite 800,

         (ii)  EMPLOYMENT.  THE COMPANY MAY TERMINATE ANY GRANTEE'S EMPLOYMENT
AT ANY TIME, WITH OR WITHOUT CAUSE, UNLESS THE TERM OF EMPLOYMENT IS COVERED BY

IMPLIES AN EMPLOYMENT CONTRACT OR TERM OF EMPLOYMENT OR ANY PROMISE OF SPECIFIC
TREATMENT UPON WHICH GRANTEE MAY RELY.

 EXHIBIT 10y

                   [FORM OF EXECUTIVE CHANGE OF CONTROL AGREEMENT]


                                  February 12, 1996


[Name]
[Title]
[Company]
7800 East Orchard Road
Englewood, Colorado 80111

Dear [Name]: 

         U S WEST, Inc. (the "Company"), on behalf of itself, its subsidiaries
and its shareholders, wishes to encourage your continued service and dedication
in the performance of your duties, notwithstanding the possibility, threat or
occurrence of a Change of Control (as defined in Subsection I(h)) of the
Company. The Board of Directors of the Company (the "Board") believes that the
prospect of a pending or threatened Change of Control inevitably creates
distractions and personal risks and uncertainties for its executives, and that
it is in the best interests of the Company to minimize such distractions to
certain executives and the Company. The Board further believes that it is in the
best interests of the Company to encourage its executives' full attention and
dedication to their duties, both currently and in the event of any threatened or
pending Change of Control. 

         Accordingly, the Board has determined that appropriate steps should be
taken to reinforce and encourage the continued retention of certain members of
the Company's management, including yourself, and the attention and dedication
of management to their assigned duties without distraction in the face of
potentially disturbing circumstances arising from the possibility of a Change of
Control of the Company. 

         In order to induce you (the "Executive") to remain in the employ of
the Company and in consideration of your continued service to the Company, the
Company agrees that you shall receive the benefits set forth in this letter
agreement (the "Agreement") in the event that your employment with the Company
is terminated subsequent to a Change of Control of the Company in the
circumstances hereinafter described. For purposes of this Agreement, references
to employment with the Company shall include employment with a Subsidiary of the
Company (as defined in Subsection I(w)).

         solely for fractional shares); 

              (iv) the shareholders of the Company approve a merger, plan of
         reorganization, consolidation or share exchange with any other
         corporation, and immediately following such merger, plan of

         unless an equivalent alternative compensation arrangement (embodied in
         an ongoing substitute or alternative plan) has been provided to the
         Executive, or the failure by the Company to continue the Executive's
         participation in any such incentive or stock option plan on
         substantially the same basis, both in terms of the amount of benefits
         provided and the level of the Executive's participation relative to
         other participants, as existed immediately prior to the time of the
         Change of Control; 

              (vi) (A) Except as required by law, the failure by the Company to
         continue to provide to the Executive benefits substantially

         the qualified and non-qualified employee benefit and welfare plans of
         the Company, including, without limitation, any pension, life
         insurance, medical, dental, health and accident, disability,
         retirement or savings plans in which the Executive was eligible to
         participate immediately prior to the Change of Control; (B) the taking
         of any action by the Company which would directly or indirectly
         materially reduce or deprive the Executive of any other perquisite
         enjoyed by the Executive immediately prior to the Change of Control
         (including Company-paid and/or reimbursed club memberships, financial
         counseling fees and the like); or (C) the failure by the Company or
         its successor to treat the Executive under the Company's vacation
         policy, past practice or special agreement in the same manner and to
         the same extent as was in effect immediately prior to the Change of
         Control; 

              (vii) The failure of the Company or any successor to obtain a
         satisfactory written agreement from any successor to assume and agree
         to perform this Agreement, as contemplated in Subsection VI(a); or

              (viii) Any purported termination of the Executive's employment
         that is not effected pursuant to a Notice of Termination satisfying
         the requirements of Subsection III(b) or, if

<PAGE>

         applicable, Subsection I(g). For purposes of this Agreement, no such
         purported termination shall be effective except as constituting Good
         Reason. 

The Executive's continued employment shall not constitute consent to, or a
waiver of rights with respect to, any circumstances constituting Good Reason
hereunder. 

         (r) GROSS-UP PAYMENT. The meaning of this term is set forth in
Subsection IV(e)(i). 

         (s) NOTICE OF TERMINATION. The meaning of this term is set forth in
Subsection III(b). 

         (t) OTHER PAYMENTS. The meaning of this term is set forth in
Subsection IV(e)(i). 

         (u) PAYMENTS. The meaning of this term is set forth in Subsection
IV(e)(i). 

         (v) RETIREMENT. For purposes of this Agreement, "Retirement" shall
mean the Executive's voluntary termination of employment with the Company, other
than for Good Reason, and in accordance with the Company's retirement policy
generally applicable to its employees or in accordance with any prior or

is owned directly or indirectly by the Company.

         (x) TAX COUNSEL. The meaning of this term is set forth in Subsection

III(a). 

         (z) TERMINATION DATE. For purposes of this Agreement, "Termination
Date" shall mean: 

              (i) If the Executive's employment is terminated for Disability,
         thirty (30) days after Notice of Termination is given (provided that
         the Executive shall not have returned to the full-time performance of
         his duties during such thirty-day period); and 

              (ii) If the Executive's employment is terminated for Cause or
         Good Reason or for any reason other than death or Disability, the date
         specified in the Notice of Termination (which in the case of a
         termination for Cause shall not be less than thirty (30) days and in
         the case of a termination for Good Reason shall not be less than
         thirty (30) days nor more than sixty (60) days, respectively, from the
         date such Notice of Termination is given).  

II. TERM OF AGREEMENT

         (a) GENERAL. Upon execution by the Executive, this Agreement shall
commence as of February 12, 1996. This Agreement shall continue in effect
through December 31, 1999; provided, however, that commencing on January 1,
2000, and every third January 1 thereafter, the term of this Agreement shall
automatically be extended for three additional years unless, not later than
ninety days prior to the January 1 on which this Agreement would otherwise
automatically be extended, the Company shall have given notice that it does not
wish to extend this Agreement; provided further, however, that if a Change of

term of this Agreement, this Agreement shall continue in effect for a period of
thirty-six months beyond the month in which the Change of Control occurred.

                                          5

<PAGE>

         (b) DISPOSITION OF EMPLOYER. In the event the Executive is employed by
a Subsidiary, the terms of this Agreement shall expire if such Subsidiary is
sold or otherwise disposed of prior to a Change of Control unless the Executive
continues in employment with the Controlled Group after such sale or other
disposition. If the Executive's Employer is sold or disposed of following a
Change of Control, this Agreement shall continue through its original term or
any extended term then in effect. 

         (c) DEEMED CHANGE OF CONTROL. If the Executive's employment with the
Employer is terminated prior to the date on which a Change of Control occurs,
and such termination was at the request of a third party who has taken steps to
effect a Change of Control or was otherwise caused by the Change of Control,
then for all purposes of this Agreement, a Change of Control shall be deemed to
have occurred prior to such termination. 

         (d) EXPIRATION OF AGREEMENT. No termination or expiration of this
Agreement shall affect any rights, obligations or liabilities of either party
that shall have accrued on or prior to the date of such termination or
expiration. 

III. TERMINATION FOLLOWING CHANGE OF CONTROL

         (a) ENTITLEMENT TO BENEFITS. If a Change of Control of the Company
shall have occurred, the Executive shall be entitled to the benefits provided in
Section IV hereof upon the subsequent termination of her employment with the
Company within three years after the date of the Change of Control unless such
termination is (i) a result of the Executive's death or Retirement, (ii) for
Cause, (iii) a result of the Executive's Disability, or (iv) by the Executive
other than for Good Reason. A termination of the Executive's employment which is
not as a result of the Executive's death, Retirement or Disability and (x) if by
the Company, is not for Cause, or (y) if by the Executive, is for Good Reason,
shall be referred to hereinafter as a "Termination." 

         (b) NOTICE OF TERMINATION. Any purported termination of the
Executive's employment by the Company or by the Executive shall be communicated
by written Notice of Termination to the other party hereto in accordance with
Section VIII. For purposes of this Agreement, a "Notice of Termination" shall
mean a notice which shall indicate the specific provision of this Agreement
relied upon and shall set forth in reasonable detail the facts and circumstances
claimed to provide a basis for termination of the Executive's employment under
the provision so indicated. If the Executive's employment shall be terminated
for Cause or by the Executive for other than Good Reason, the Company shall pay
the Executive his full base salary through the Termination Date at the rate in
effect at the time Notice of Termination is given and shall pay any amounts to
be paid to the Executive pursuant to any other compensation plans, programs or
employment agreements then in effect, and the Company shall have no further
obligations to the Executive under this Agreement. 

         If within thirty (30) days after any Notice of Termination is given,
the party receiving such Notice notifies the other party that a dispute exists
concerning the grounds for termination, then, notwithstanding the meaning of
"Termination Date" set forth in Subsection I(z), the Termination Date shall be
the date on which the dispute is finally resolved, whether by mutual written
agreement of the parties or by a decision rendered pursuant to Section XI;
provided that the Termination Date shall be extended by a notice of dispute only
if such notice is given in good faith and the party giving such notice pursues
the resolution of such dispute with reasonable diligence. Notwithstanding the
pendency of any such dispute, the Company will continue to pay the Executive his
full compensation in effect when the notice giving rise to the dispute was
given, and continue the Executive as a participant in all benefits plans or
perquisites in which the Executive was participating or which he was enjoying
when the Notice of Termination giving rise to the dispute was given, until the
dispute is finally resolved. Amounts paid under this Subsection III(b) are in 

                                          6

<PAGE>

addition to all other amounts due under this Agreement and shall not be offset
against or reduce any other amounts due under this Agreement. 

IV. COMPENSATION UPON A TERMINATION

         Following a Change of Control of the Company, upon a Termination of
the Executive's employment, the Executive shall be entitled to the following
benefits, provided that the Termination occurs during the three-year period
immediately following the date of the Change of Control: 

         (a) STANDARD BENEFITS. The Company shall pay the Executive his full
base salary through the Termination Date at the rate in effect at the time the
Notice of Termination is given, no later than the second day following the
Termination Date, plus all other amounts to which the Executive is entitled
under any compensation plan of the Company applicable to the Executive at the
time such payments are due. Without limitation, amounts payable pursuant to this
Subsection IV(a) shall include, pursuant to the express terms of the short-term
incentive plan in which the Executive participates or otherwise, the Executive's
annual bonus under such short-term incentive plan, pro-rated to the Termination
Date. 

         (b) ADDITIONAL BENEFITS. The Company shall pay to the Executive as
additional pay ("Additional Pay"), the product of (i) the lesser of (x) three
(3) or (y) the difference between sixty-five (65) and the Executive's age as of
the date of the Notice of Termination (calculated to the nearest twelfth of a
year), multiplied by (ii) the sum of (x) the Executive's annual base salary rate
in effect immediately prior to the Termination Date and (y) the Executive's
annual bonus amount under the short-term incentive plan in which the Executive
participates, such bonus amount to be calculated on the basis of the extent to
which the performance factors targeted by the Human Resources Committee of the
Board have been achieved (for this purpose, the Company's performance through
the Termination Date shall be annualized based upon the actual number of days
elapsed from the beginning of the fiscal year in which the Termination occurs
through the Termination Date over a year of 360 days), which shall be deemed to
be 100% unless the performance actually achieved is greater than 100%, in which
case the actual performance levels shall be utilized. The Company shall pay to
the Executive the Additional Pay in a lump sum, in cash, not later than the
fifteenth day following the Termination Date. 

         (c) RETIREMENT PLAN BENEFITS. If not already vested, the Executive
shall be deemed fully vested in all Company retirement plans and/or other
written agreements relating to pay upon retirement in which the Executive was a
participant, party or beneficiary immediately preceding a Change of Control, and
any additional plans and/or agreements in which such Executive became a
participant, party or beneficiary thereafter. In addition to the foregoing, for
purposes of determining the amounts to be paid to the Executive under such plans
and/or agreements, the years of service with the Company and the age of the
Executive under all such plans and agreements shall be deemed increased by the
lesser of thirty-six (36) months or such shorter period of time as would render
the Executive sixty-five (65) years of age. For purposes of this Subsection
IV(c), "plans" include, without limitation, the Company's qualified pension
plan, non-qualified and mid-career retirement plans, and "agreements" encompass
the terms of any offer letters leading to the Executive's employment with the
Company where the Executive was a signatory thereto and any written amendments
to the foregoing. In the event that the terms of the plans referenced in this
Subsection IV(c) do not for any reason (e.g., if plan amendments would cause
disqualification of qualified plans) coincide with the provisions of this
Subsection IV(c), the Executive shall be entitled to receive from the Company
under the terms of this Agreement an amount equivalent to all amounts he would
have received had all such plans continued in existence as in effect on the date
of this Agreement after being amended to coincide with the terms of this
Subsection IV(c). 

                                          7

<PAGE>

         (d) HEALTH BENEFITS. Following the Termination Date, the Company shall
continue to provide health, vision and dental benefits to the Executive and the
Executive's eligible dependents on terms substantially equivalent to those on
which the Company provides such benefits to retired employees who were service
pension-eligible at the time of the Change of Control and whose retirement date
most closely approximates the date of the Change of Control. The eligibility of
the Executive's dependents shall be determined by the terms of the health,
vision and dental benefit plans in effect prior to the Change of Control. 

         (e) GROSS-UP PAYMENTS. 

              (i) In the event that any payment or the value of any benefit
         received or to be received by the Executive in connection with the
         Executive's Termination or contingent upon a Change of Control of the
         Company (whether received or to be received pursuant to the terms of
         this Agreement (the "Agreement Payments") or of any other plan,
         arrangement or agreement of the Company, its successors, any person
         whose actions result in a Change of Control of the Company or any
         person affiliated with any of them (or which, as a result of the
         completion of the transactions causing a Change of Control, will
         become affiliated with any of them) ("Other Payments" and, together
         with the Agreement Payments, the "Payments")) would be subject to the
         excise tax imposed by Section 4999 of the Internal Revenue Code of
         1986, as amended (the "Code") or any comparable federal, state or
         local excise tax (such excise tax, together with any interest and
         penalties, are hereinafter collectively referred to as the "Excise
         Tax"), as determined as provided below, the Company shall pay to the
         Executive an additional amount (the "Gross-Up Payment") such that the
         net amount retained by the Executive, after deduction of the Excise
         Tax on Agreement Payments and Other Payments and any federal, state
         and local income tax and Excise Tax upon the payment provided for by
         this Subsection IV(e)(i), and any interest, penalties or additions to
         tax payable by the Executive with respect thereto shall be equal to
         the total present value of the Agreement Payments and Other Payments
         at the time such Payments are to be made. The intent of the parties is
         that the Company shall be solely responsible for and shall pay, any
         Excise Tax on any Payments and Gross-Up Payment and any income and
         employment taxes (including, without limitation, penalties and
         interest) imposed on any Gross-Up Payments as well as any loss of
         deduction caused by the Gross-Up Payment. 

              (ii) All determinations required to be made under this Subsection
         IV(e), including, without limitation, whether and when a Gross-Up
         Payment is required and the amount of such Gross-Up Payment and the
         assumptions to be utilized in arriving at such determinations, shall
         be made by tax counsel selected by the Company and reasonably
         acceptable to the Executive ("Tax Counsel"). The Company shall cause
         the Tax Counsel to provide detailed supporting calculations to the
         Company and the Executive within fifteen (15) business days after
         notice is given by the Executive to the Company that any or all of the
         Payments have occurred, or such earlier time as is requested by the
         Company. Within two (2) business days after such notice is given to
         the Company, the Company shall instruct the Tax Counsel to timely
         provide the data required by this Subsection IV(e) to the Executive.
         All fees and expenses of the Tax Counsel shall be paid solely by the
         Company. Any Excise Tax as determined pursuant to this Subsection
         IV(e) shall be paid by the Company to the Internal Revenue Service
         and/or other appropriate taxing authority on the Executive's behalf
         within five (5) days after receipt of the Tax Counsel's determination.
         If the Tax Counsel determines that there is substantial authority
         (within the meaning of Section 6662 of the Code) that no Excise Tax is
         payable by the Executive, the Tax Counsel shall furnish the Executive
         with a written opinion that failure to disclose or report the Excise
         Tax on the Executive's federal income tax return will not constitute a
         substantial understatement of tax or be reasonably likely to result in
         the imposition of a negligence or similar penalty. Any determination
         by the Tax Counsel shall be binding upon the

                                          8

<PAGE>

         Company and the Executive in the absence of material mathematical or
         legal error. As a result of the uncertainty in the application of
         Section 4999 of the Code at the time the initial determination by the
         Tax Counsel hereunder, it is possible that Gross-Up Payments will not
         have been made by the Corporation that should have been made or that
         Gross-Up Payments have been made that should not have been made, in
         each case, consistent with the calculations required to be made
         hereunder. In the event the Company exhausts its remedies pursuant to
         Subsection IV(e)(iii) below and the Executive is thereafter required
         to make a payment of any Excise Tax, the Tax Counsel shall determine
         the amount of underpayment of Excise Taxes that has occurred and any
         such underpayment shall be promptly paid by the Company to the
         Internal Revenue Service or other appropriate taxing authority on the
         Executive's behalf or, if such underpayment has been previously paid
         by the Executive, to the Executive. In the event that the Tax Counsel
         determines that an overpayment of Gross-Up Payments has occurred, any
         such overpayment shall be treated for all purposes as a loan to the
         Executive with interest at the applicable federal rate provided for in
         Section 7872(f)(2) of the Code, due and payable within ninety (90)
         days after written demand to the Executive by the Company; provided,
         however, that the Executive shall have no duty or obligation
         whatsoever to repay such loan unless the Executive's receipt of the
         overpayment, or any portion thereof, is includible in the Executive's
         income and the Executive's repayment of the same is not deductible by
         the Executive for federal and state income tax purposes. 

              (iii) The Executive shall notify the Company in writing of any
         claim by the Internal Revenue Service or state or local taxing
         authority, that, if successful, would result in any Excise Tax or an
         underpayment of Gross-Up Payments. Such notice shall be given as soon
         as practicable but no later than fifteen (15) business days after the
         Executive is informed in writing of the claim and shall inform the
         Company of the nature of the claim, the administrative or judicial
         appeal period, and the date on which any payment of the claim must be
         paid. The Executive shall not pay any portion of the claim prior to
         the expiration of the thirty (30) day period following the date on
         which the Executive gives such notice to the Company (or such shorter
         period ending on the date that any amount under the claim is due). If
         the Company notifies the Executive in writing prior to the expiration
         of such thirty (30) day period that it desires to contest the claim,
         the Executive shall: 

                   (A) give the Company any information reasonably requested by
              the Company relating to the claim; 

                   (B) take such action in connection with contesting the claim
              as the Company shall reasonably request in writing from time to
              time, including, without limitation, accepting legal
              representation concerning the claim by an attorney selected by
              the Company who is reasonably acceptable to the Executive; and 

                   (C) cooperate with the Company in good faith in order to
              effectively contest the claim; provided, however, that the
              Company shall bear and pay directly all costs and expenses
              (including, without limitation, additional interest and penalties
              and attorneys' fees) incurred in such contests and shall
              indemnify and hold the Executive harmless, on an after-tax basis,
              for any Excise Tax or income tax (including, without limitation,
              interest and penalties thereon) imposed as a result of such
              representation. Without limitation upon the foregoing provisions
              of this Subsection IV(e) (iii), except as provided below, the
              Company shall control all proceedings concerning such contest
              and, in its sole opinion, may pursue or forego any and all
              administrative appeal, proceedings, hearings and conferences with
              the taxing authority pertaining to the claim. At the written
              request of the Company and upon payment to the Executive of an
              amount at least equal to the claim plus any

                                          9

<PAGE>

              additional amount necessary to obtain the jurisdiction of the
              appropriate tribunal and/or court, the Executive shall pay the
              same and sue for a refund. The Executive agrees to prosecute any
              contest of a claim to a determination before any administrative
              tribunal, in a court of initial jurisdiction and in one or more
              appellate courts, as the Company shall determine; provided,
              however, that if the Company requests the Executive to pay the
              claim and sue for a refund, the Company shall advance the amount
              of such payment to the Executive, on an interest-free basis, and
              shall indemnify and hold the Executive harmless on an after-tax
              basis, from any Excise Tax or income tax (including, without
              limitation, interest and penalties thereon) imposed on such
              advance or for any imputed income on such advance. Any extension
              of the statute of limitations relating to assessment of any
              Excise Tax for the taxable year of the Executive which is the
              subject of the claim is to be limited solely to the claim.
              Furthermore, the Company's control of the contest shall be
              limited to issues for which a Gross-Up Payment would be payable
              hereunder. The Executive shall be entitled to settle or contest,
              as the case may be, any other issue raised by the Internal
              Revenue Service or any other taxing authority. 

              (iv) If, after the receipt by the Executive of an amount advanced
         by the Company pursuant to Subsection IV(e)(iii) above, the Executive
         receives any refund of a claim and/or any additional amount that was
         necessary to obtain jurisdiction, the Executive shall promptly pay to
         the Company the amount of such refund (together with any interest paid
         or credited thereon after taxes applicable thereto). If, after the
         receipt by the Executive of an amount advanced by the Company pursuant
         to Subsection IV(e)(iii) above, a determination is made that the
         Executive shall not be entitled to any refund of the claim and the
         Company does not notify the Executive in writing of its intent to
         contest such denial of refund of a claim prior to the expiration of
         thirty (30) days after such determination, then the portion of such
         advance attributable to a claim shall be forgiven and shall not be
         required to be repaid. The amount of such advance attributable to a
         claim shall offset, to the extent thereof, the amount of the
         underpayment required to be paid by the Company to the Executive. 

              (v) If, after the advance by the Company of an additional amount
         necessary to obtain jurisdiction, there is a final determination made
         by the taxing authority that the Executive is not entitled to any
         refund of such amount, or any portion thereof, then such nonrefundable
         amount shall be repaid to the Company by the Executive within thirty
         (30) days after the Executive receives notice of such final
         determination. A final determination shall occur when the period to
         contest or otherwise appeal any decision by an administrative tribunal
         or court of initial jurisdiction has been waived or the time for
         contesting or appealing the same has expired. 

         (f) LEGAL FEES AND EXPENSES. The Company shall pay to the Executive
all legal fees and expenses as and when incurred by the Executive in connection
with this Agreement, including all such fees and expenses, if any, incurred in
contesting or disputing any Termination or in seeking to obtain or enforce any
right or benefit provided by this Agreement, regardless of the outcome, unless,
in the case of a legal action brought by or in the name of the Executive, a
decision is rendered pursuant to Section X that such action was not brought by
the Executive in good faith. 

         (g) NO MITIGATION. The Executive shall not be required to mitigate the
amount of any payment provided for in this Section IV by seeking other
employment or otherwise, nor shall the amount of any payment or benefit provided

the result of employment by another employer or by retirement or other benefits
received after the Termination Date or otherwise, except as specifically
provided in this Section IV. The Company's obligation to make payments provided
for in this Agreement and otherwise to perform its obligations hereunder shall

V. DEATH AND DISABILITY BENEFITS

         In the event of the death or Disability of the Executive after a
Change of Control of the Company, the Executive, or in the case of death, the
Executive's beneficiaries, shall receive the benefits to which they are entitled
under the retirement plans, disability policies and other applicable plans or
agreements of the Company. 

VI. SUCCESSORS; BINDING AGREEMENT

         (a) OBLIGATIONS OF SUCCESSORS. The Company will require any successor
(whether direct or indirect, by purchase, merger, consolidation or otherwise) to
all or substantially all of the business and/or assets of the Company to
expressly assume and agree to perform this Agreement in the same manner and to
the same extent that the Company is required to perform it. Failure of the
Company to obtain such assumption and agreement prior to the effectiveness of
any such succession shall be a breach of this Agreement and shall entitle the
Executive to compensation from the Company in the same amount and on the same
terms as the Executive would be entitled hereunder if the Executive had
terminated employment for Good Reason following a Change of Control of the
Company, except that for purposes of implementing the foregoing, the date on
which any such succession becomes effective shall be deemed the Termination
Date. As used in this Agreement, the "Company" shall mean the Company as
hereinabove defined and any successor to its business and/or assets as aforesaid
which assumes and agrees to perform this Agreement by operation of law, or
otherwise. 

         (b) ENFORCEABLE BY BENEFICIARIES. This Agreement shall inure to the 
benefit of and be enforceable by the Executive's personal or legal 
representatives, executors, administrators, successors, heirs, distributees, 
devisees and legatees (the "Beneficiaries"). In the event of the death of the 
Executive while any amount would still be payable hereunder if such death had 
not occurred, all such amounts, unless otherwise provided herein, shall be 
paid in accordance with the terms of this Agreement to the Executive's 
Beneficiaries.

         (c) EMPLOYMENT. Except in the event of a Change of Control and,
thereafter, only as specifically set forth in this Agreement, nothing in this
Agreement shall be construed to (i) limit in any way the right of the Company or
a Subsidiary to terminate the Executive's employment at any time for any reason
or for no reason; or (ii) be evidence of any agreement or understanding,
expressed or implied, that the Company or a Subsidiary will employ the Executive
in any particular position, on any particular terms or at any particular rate of
remuneration. 


VII. CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION. 

         The Executive shall hold in fiduciary capacity for the benefit of the
Company all secret or confidential information, knowledge or data relating to
the Company, the Subsidiaries and their respective businesses, which shall have
been obtained during the Executive's employment by the Employer and which shall
not be public knowledge (other than by acts by the Executive or his
representatives in violation of this Agreement). After termination of the
Executive's employment with the Company or any Employer within the Controlled
Group, the Executive shall not, without prior written consent of the Company or
the Employer, communicate or divulge any such information, knowledge or data to
anyone other than the Company, the Employer or those designated by them. In no
event shall an asserted violation of this Section VII constitute a basis for
deferring or withholding any amounts otherwise payable to the Executive under
this Agreement.

IX. MISCELLANEOUS

         No provision of this Agreement may be modified, waived or discharged
unless such waiver, modification or discharge is agreed to in writing and signed
by the Executive and the Company's Chief Executive Officer. No waiver by either
party hereto at any time of any breach by the other party hereto of, or
compliance with, any conditions or provision of this Agreement to be performed
by such other party shall be deemed a waiver of similar or dissimilar provisions
or conditions at the same or at any prior or subsequent time. No agreements or
representations, oral or otherwise, express or implied, with respect to the
subject matter hereof have been made by either party which are not expressly set
forth in this Agreement. The validity, interpretation, construction and

deemed also to refer to any successor provisions of such sections. Any payments
provided for hereunder shall be paid net of any applicable withholding required
under federal, state or local law. The obligations of the Company under Sections
IV and V shall survive the expiration of the term of this Agreement. 

X. VALIDITY

         The invalidity or unenforceability of any provision of this Agreement
shall not affect the validity or enforceability of any other provision of this
Agreement, which shall remain in full force and effect. 

XI. ARBITRATION

         The Executive may agree in writing with the Company (in which case
this Article XI shall have effect but not otherwise) that any dispute that may
arise directly or indirectly in connection with this Agreement, the Executive's
employment or the termination of the Executive's employment, whether arising in
contract, statute, tort, fraud, misrepresentation, or other legal theory, shall
be determined solely by

                                          12

<PAGE>

arbitration in Denver, Colorado under the rules of the AAA. The only legal
claims between the Executive, on the one hand, and the Company or any
Subsidiary, on the other, that would not be included in this agreement to
arbitration are claims by the Executive for workers' compensation or
unemployment compensation benefits, claims for benefits under a Company or
Subsidiary benefit plan if the plan does not provide for arbitration of such
disputes, and claims by the Executive that seek judicial relief in the form of
specific performance of the right to be paid until the Termination Date during
the pendency of any dispute or controversy arising under or Subsection III(b).
If this Article XI is in effect, any claim with respect to this Agreement, the
Executive's employment or the termination of the Executive's employment must be
established by a preponderance of the evidence submitted to the impartial
arbitrator. A single arbitrator engaged in the practice of law shall conduct any
arbitration under the then current procedures of the American Arbitration
Association (the "AAA") and under the AAA's then current Model Employment
Arbitration Rules. The arbitrator shall have the authority to order a pre-
hearing exchange of information by the parties including, without limitation,
production of requested documents, and examination by deposition of parties and
their authorized agents. If this Article XI is in effect, the decision of the
arbitrator (i) shall be final and binding, (ii) shall be rendered within ninety
(90) days after the impanelment of the arbitrator, and (iii) shall be kept
confidential by the parties to such arbitration. The arbitration award may be
enforced in any court of competent jurisdiction. The Federal Arbitration Act, 9
U.S.C. 1-15, not state law, shall govern the arbitrability of all claims. 
         If this letter sets forth our agreement on the subject matter hereof,
kindly sign both originals of this letter and return to the Vice President - Law
and Human Resources of the Company one of the fully executed originals of this
letter which will then constitute our agreement on this subject. 


Sincerely,

 EXHIBIT 10Z

          [FORM OF CHANGE OF CONTROL AGREEMENT FOR CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER]







                             February 12, 1996



[Name]
Chairman, President and
  Chief Executive Officer
U S WEST, Inc.
7800 East Orchard Road
Englewood, Colorado  80111

Dear [Name]:

         U S WEST, Inc. (the "Company"), on behalf of itself, its subsidiaries
and its shareholders, wishes to encourage your continued service and dedication
in the performance of your duties, notwithstanding the possibility, threat or
occurrence of a Change of Control (as defined in Subsection I(h)) of the
Company.  The Board of Directors of the Company (the "Board") believes that the
prospect of a pending or threatened Change of Control inevitably creates
distractions and personal risks and uncertainties for its executives, and that
it is in the best interests of the Company to minimize such distractions to
certain executives and the Company.  The Board further believes that it is in
the best interests of the Company to encourage its executives' full attention
and dedication to their duties, both currently and in the event of any
threatened or pending Change of Control.  

         Accordingly, the Board has determined that appropriate steps should be
taken to reinforce and encourage the continued retention of certain members of
the Company's management, including yourself, and the attention and dedication
of management to their assigned duties without distraction in the face of
potentially disturbing circumstances arising from the possibility of a Change of
Control of the Company.  

         In order to induce you (the "Executive") to remain in the employ of
the Company and in consideration of your continued service to the Company, the
Company agrees that you shall receive the benefits set forth in this letter
agreement (the "Agreement") in the event that your employment with the Company
is terminated for any reason subsequent to a Change of Control of the Company. 
For purposes of this Agreement, references to employment with the Company shall
include employment with a Subsidiary of the Company (as defined in Subsection
I(w)).

automatically be extended, the Company shall have given notice that it does not
wish to extend this Agreement; provided further, however, that if a Change of
Control of the Company shall have occurred during the original or any extended
term of this Agreement, this Agreement shall continue in effect for a period of
thirty-six months beyond the month in which the Change of Control occurred.  

         (b) DISPOSITION OF EMPLOYER.  In the event the Executive is employed
by a Subsidiary, the terms of this Agreement shall expire if such Subsidiary is
sold or otherwise disposed of prior to a Change of Control unless the Executive
continues in employment with the Controlled Group after such sale or other
disposition.  If the Executive's Employer is sold or disposed of following a
Change of Control, this Agreement shall continue through its original term or
any extended term then in effect.  

         (c) DEEMED CHANGE OF CONTROL.  If the Executive's employment with the
Employer is terminated prior to the date on which a Change of Control occurs,
and such termination was at the request of a third party who has taken steps to
effect a Change of Control or was otherwise caused by the Change of Control,
then for all purposes of this Agreement, a Change of Control shall be deemed to
have occurred prior to such termination.  

         (d) EXPIRATION OF AGREEMENT.  No termination or expiration of this
Agreement shall affect any rights, obligations or liabilities of either party
that shall have accrued on or prior to the date of such termination or
expiration.  

III.  TERMINATION FOLLOWING CHANGE OF CONTROL

         (a) ENTITLEMENT TO BENEFITS.  If a Change of Control (other than a
Change of Control within the meaning of Subsection I(h)(v)) of the Company shall
have occurred, the Executive shall be entitled to the benefits provided in
Section IV hereof upon the subsequent termination of his employment with the
Company for any reason within three years after the date of the Change of
Control.  If a Change of Control within the meaning of Subsection I(h)(v) shall
have occurred, the Executive shall be entitled to the benefits provided in
Section IV hereof upon the subsequent termination of his employment with the
Company within three years after the date of the Change of Control unless such
termination is (i) a result of the Executive's death or Retirement, (ii) for
Cause, (iii) a result of the Executive's Disability, or (iv) by the Executive
other than for Good Reason.  A termination of the Executive's employment that
entitles the Executive to the payment of benefits under Section IV hereof shall
be referred to hereinafter as a "Termination."

                                          6
<PAGE>

         (b) NOTICE OF TERMINATION.  Any purported termination of the
Executive's employment by the Company or by the Executive shall be communicated
by written Notice of Termination to the other party hereto in accordance with
Section VIII.  For purposes of this Agreement, a "Notice of Termination" shall
mean a notice form a party to this Agreement that purports to terminate the
Executive's employment, unless such notice follows a Change of Control solely
within the meaning of Subsection I(h)(v), in which case a "Notice of
Termination" shall mean a notice that shall indicate the specific provision of
this Agreement relied upon and shall set forth in reasonable detail the facts
and circumstances claimed to provide a basis for termination of the Executive's
employment under the provision so indicated.  

         Once a Notice of Termination is given (other than following a Change
of Control solely within the meaning of Subsection I(h)(v)), the Company shall
pay the Executive his full base salary through the Termination Date at the rate
in effect at the time Notice of Termination is given and shall pay any amounts
to be paid to the Executive pursuant to any other compensation plans, programs
or employment agreements then in effect.  If, following a Change of Control
solely within the meaning of Subsection I(h)(v), the Executive's employment
shall be terminated for Cause or by the Executive for other than Good Reason,
the Company shall pay the Executive his full base salary through the Termination
Date at the rate in effect at the time Notice of Termination is given and shall
pay any amounts to be paid to the Executive pursuant to any other compensation
plans, programs or employment agreements then in effect, and the Company shall
have no further obligations to the Executive under this Agreement.  

         If within thirty (30) days after any Notice of Termination is given,
the party receiving such Notice notifies the other party that a dispute exists
concerning the grounds for termination, then, notwithstanding the meaning of
"Termination Date" set forth in Subsection I(z), the Termination Date shall be
the date on which the dispute is finally resolved, whether by mutual written
agreement of the parties or by a decision rendered pursuant to Section XI;
provided that the Termination Date shall be extended by a notice of dispute only
if such notice is given in good faith and the party giving such notice pursues
the resolution of such dispute with reasonable diligence.  Notwithstanding the
pendency of any such dispute, the Company will continue to pay the Executive his
full compensation in effect when the notice giving rise to the dispute was
given, and continue the Executive as a participant in all benefits plans or
perquisites in which the Executive was participating or which he was enjoying
when the Notice of Termination giving rise to the dispute was given, until the
dispute is finally resolved.  Amounts paid under this Subsection III(b) are in
addition to all other amounts due under this Agreement and shall not be offset
against or reduce any other amounts due under this Agreement.  

IV.  COMPENSATION UPON A TERMINATION

         Following a Change of Control of the Company, upon a Termination of
the Executive's employment, the Executive shall be entitled to the following
benefits, provided that the Termination occurs during the three-year period
immediately following the date of the Change of Control:  

         (a) STANDARD BENEFITS.  The Company shall pay the Executive his full
base salary through the Termination Date at the rate in effect at the time the
Notice of Termination is given, no later than the second day following the
Termination Date, plus all other amounts to which the Executive is entitled
under any compensation plan of the Company applicable to the Executive at the
time such payments are due.  Without limitation, amounts payable pursuant to
this Subsection IV(a) shall include, pursuant to the express terms of the
short-term incentive plan in which the Executive participates or otherwise, the
Executive's annual bonus under such short-term incentive plan, pro-rated to the
Termination Date.  

                                          7
<PAGE>

         (b) ADDITIONAL BENEFITS.  The Company shall pay to the Executive as
additional pay ("Additional Pay"), the product of (i) the lesser of (x) three
(3) or (y) the difference between sixty-five (65) and the Executive's age as of
the date of the Notice of Termination (calculated to the nearest twelfth of a
year), multiplied by (ii) the sum of (x) the Executive's annual base salary rate
in effect immediately prior to the Termination Date and (y) the Executive's
annual bonus amount under the short-term incentive plan in which the Executive
participates, such bonus amount to be calculated on the basis of the extent to
which the performance factors targeted by the Human Resources Committee of the
Board have been achieved (for this purpose, the Company's performance through
the Termination Date shall be annualized based upon the actual number of days
elapsed from the beginning of the fiscal year in which the Termination occurs
through the Termination Date over a year of 360 days), which shall be deemed to
be 100% unless the performance actually achieved is greater than 100%, in which
case the actual performance levels shall be utilized.  The Company shall pay to
the Executive the Additional Pay in a lump sum, in cash, not later than the
fifteenth day following the Termination Date.  

         (c) RETIREMENT PLAN BENEFITS.  If not already vested, the Executive
shall be deemed fully vested in all Company retirement plans and/or other
written agreements relating to pay upon retirement in which the Executive was a
participant, party or beneficiary immediately preceding a Change of Control, and
any additional plans and/or agreements in which such Executive became a
participant, party or beneficiary thereafter.  In addition to the foregoing, for
purposes of determining the amounts to be paid to the Executive under such plans
and/or agreements, the years of service with the Company and the age of the
Executive under all such plans and agreements shall be deemed increased by the
lesser of thirty-six (36) months or such shorter period of time as would render
the Executive sixty-five (65) years of age.  For purposes of this Subsection
IV(c), "plans" include, without limitation, the Company's qualified pension
plan, non-qualified and mid-career retirement plans, and "agreements" encompass
the terms of any offer letters leading to the Executive's employment with the
Company where the Executive was a signatory thereto and any written amendments
to the foregoing.  In the event that the terms of the plans referenced in this
Subsection IV(c) do not for any reason (e.g., if plan amendments would cause
disqualification of qualified plans) coincide with the provisions of this
Subsection IV(c), the Executive shall be entitled to receive from the Company
under the terms of this Agreement an amount equivalent to all amounts he would
have received had all such plans continued in existence as in effect on the date
of this Agreement after being amended to coincide with the terms of this
Subsection IV(c).  

         (d) HEALTH BENEFITS.  Following the Termination Date, the Company
shall continue to provide health, vision and dental benefits to the Executive
and the Executive's eligible dependents on terms substantially equivalent to
those on which the Company provides such benefits to retired employees who were
service pension-eligible at the time of the Change of Control and whose
retirement date most closely approximates the date of the Change of Control. 
The eligibility of the Executive's dependents shall be determined by the terms
of the health, vision and dental benefit plans in effect immediately prior to
the Change of Control.  

         (e) GROSS-UP PAYMENTS.  

              (i) In the event that any payment or the value of any benefit
         received or to be received by the Executive in connection with the
         Executive's Termination or contingent upon a Change of Control of the
         Company (whether received or to be received pursuant to the terms of
         this Agreement (the "Agreement Payments") or of any other plan,
         arrangement or agreement of the Company, its successors, any person
         whose actions result in a Change of Control of the Company or any
         person affiliated with any of them (or which, as a result of the
         completion of the transactions causing a Change of Control, will
         become affiliated with any of them) ("Other Payments" and,

                                          8
<PAGE>

         together with the Agreement Payments, the "Payments")) would be
         subject to the excise tax imposed by Section 4999 of the Internal
         Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the "Code") or any comparable
         federal, state or local excise tax (such excise tax, together with any
         interest and penalties, are hereinafter collectively referred to as
         the "Excise Tax"), as determined as provided below, the Company shall
         pay to the Executive an additional amount (the "Gross-Up Payment")
         such that the net amount retained by the Executive, after deduction of
         the Excise Tax on Agreement Payments and Other Payments and any
         federal, state and local income tax and Excise Tax upon the payment
         provided for by this Subsection IV(e)(i), and any interest, penalties
         or additions to tax payable by the Executive with respect thereto
         shall be equal to the total present value of the Agreement Payments
         and Other Payments at the time such Payments are to be made.  The
         intent of the parties is that the Company shall be solely responsible
         for and shall pay, any Excise Tax on any Payments and Gross-Up Payment
         and any income and employment taxes (including, without limitation,
         penalties and interest) imposed on any Gross-Up Payments as well as
         any loss of deduction caused by the Gross-Up Payment.  

              (ii) All determinations required to be made under this Subsection
         IV(e), including, without limitation, whether and when a Gross-Up
         Payment is required and the amount of such Gross-Up Payment and the
         assumptions to be utilized in arriving at such determinations, shall
         be made by tax counsel selected by the Company and reasonably
         acceptable to the Executive ("Tax Counsel").  The Company shall cause
         the Tax Counsel to provide detailed supporting calculations to the
         Company and the Executive within fifteen (15) business days after
         notice is given by the Executive to the Company that any or all of the
         Payments have occurred, or such earlier time as is requested by the
         Company.  Within two (2) business days after such notice is given to
         the Company, the Company shall instruct the Tax Counsel to timely
         provide the data required by this Subsection IV(e) to the Executive. 
         All fees and expenses of the Tax Counsel shall be paid solely by the
         Company.  Any Excise Tax as determined pursuant to this Subsection
         IV(e) shall be paid by the Company to the Internal Revenue Service
         and/or other appropriate taxing authority on the Executive's behalf
         within five (5) days after receipt of the Tax Counsel's determination. 
         If the Tax Counsel determines that there is substantial authority
         (within the meaning of Section 6662 of the Code) that no Excise Tax is
         payable by the Executive, the Tax Counsel shall furnish the Executive
         with a written opinion that failure to disclose or report the Excise
         Tax on the Executive's federal income tax return will not constitute a
         substantial understatement of tax or be reasonably likely to result in
         the imposition of a negligence or similar penalty.  Any determination
         by the Tax Counsel shall be binding upon the Company and the Executive
         in the absence of material mathematical or legal error.  As a result
         of the uncertainty in the application of Section 4999 of the Code at
         the time the initial determination by the Tax Counsel hereunder, it is
         possible that Gross-Up Payments will not have been made by the
         Corporation that should have been made or that Gross-Up Payments have
         been made that should not have been made, in each case, consistent
         with the calculations required to be made hereunder.  In the event the
         Company exhausts its remedies pursuant to Subsection IV(e)(iii) below
         and the Executive is thereafter required to make a payment of any
         Excise Tax, the Tax Counsel shall determine the amount of underpayment
         of Excise Taxes that has occurred and any such underpayment shall be
         promptly paid by the Company to the Internal Revenue Service or other
         appropriate taxing authority on the Executive's behalf or, if such
         underpayment has been previously paid by the Executive, to the
         Executive.  In the event that the Tax Counsel determines that an
         overpayment of Gross-Up Payments has occurred, any such overpayment
         shall be treated for all purposes as a loan to the Executive with
         interest at the applicable federal rate provided for in Section
         7872(f)(2) of the Code, due and payable within ninety (90) days after
         written demand to the Executive by the Company; provided, however,
         that the Executive shall have no duty or obligation whatsoever to
         repay such loan unless the Executive's receipt of the overpayment, or
         any portion

                                          9

<PAGE>



         thereof, is includible in the Executive's income and the Executive's
         repayment of the same is not deductible by the Executive for federal
         and state income tax purposes.  

              (iii) The Executive shall notify the Company in writing of any
         claim by the Internal Revenue Service or state or local taxing
         authority, that, if successful, would result in any Excise Tax or an
         underpayment of Gross-Up Payments.  Such notice shall be given as soon
         as practicable but no later than fifteen (15) business days after the
         Executive is informed in writing of the claim and shall inform the
         Company of the nature of the claim, the administrative or judicial
         appeal period, and the date on which any payment of the claim must be
         paid.  The Executive shall not pay any portion of the claim prior to
         the expiration of the thirty (30) day period following the date on
         which the Executive gives such notice to the Company (or such shorter
         period ending on the date that any amount under the claim is due).  If
         the Company notifies the Executive in writing prior to the expiration
         of such thirty (30) day period that it desires to contest the claim,
         the Executive shall:  

                   (A) give the Company any information reasonably requested by
              the Company relating to the claim; 

                   (B) take such action in connection with contesting the claim
              as the Company shall reasonably request in writing from time to
              time, including, without limitation, accepting legal
              representation concerning the claim by an attorney selected by
              the Company who is reasonably acceptable to the Executive; and 

                   (C) cooperate with the Company in good faith in order to
              effectively contest the claim; provided, however, that the
              Company shall bear and pay directly all costs and expenses
              (including, without limitation, additional interest and penalties
              and attorneys' fees) incurred in such contests and shall
              indemnify and hold the Executive harmless, on an after-tax basis,
              for any Excise Tax or income tax (including, without limitation,
              interest and penalties thereon) imposed as a result of such
              representation.  Without limitation upon the foregoing provisions
              of this Subsection IV(e) (iii), except as provided below, the
              Company shall control all proceedings concerning such contest
              and, in its sole opinion, may pursue or forego any and all
              administrative appeal, proceedings, hearings and conferences with
              the taxing authority pertaining to the claim. At the written
              request of the Company and upon payment to the Executive of an
              amount at least equal to the claim plus any additional amount
              necessary to obtain the jurisdiction of the appropriate tribunal
              and/or court, the Executive shall pay the same and sue for a
              refund.  The Executive agrees to prosecute any contest of a claim
              to a determination before any administrative tribunal, in a court
              of initial jurisdiction and in one or more appellate courts, as
              the Company shall determine; provided, however, that if the
              Company requests the Executive to pay the claim and sue for a
              refund, the Company shall advance the amount of such payment to
              the Executive, on an interest-free basis, and shall indemnify and
              hold the Executive harmless on an after-tax basis, from any
              Excise Tax or income tax (including, without limitation, interest
              and penalties thereon) imposed on such advance or for any imputed
              income on such advance.  Any extension of the statute of
              limitations relating to assessment of any Excise Tax for the
              taxable year of the Executive which is the subject of the claim
              is to be limited solely to the claim.  Furthermore, the Company's
              control of the contest shall be limited to issues for which a
              Gross-Up Payment would be payable hereunder.  The Executive shall
              be entitled to settle or contest, as the case may be, any other
              issue raised by the Internal Revenue Service or any other taxing
              authority.  

                                          10

<PAGE>

              (iv) If, after the receipt by the Executive of an amount advanced
         by the Company pursuant to Subsection IV(e)(iii) above, the Executive
         receives any refund of a claim and/or any additional amount that was
         necessary to obtain jurisdiction, the Executive shall promptly pay to
         the Company the amount of such refund (together with any interest paid
         or credited thereon after taxes applicable thereto).  If, after the
         receipt by the Executive of an amount advanced by the Company pursuant
         to Subsection IV(e)(iii) above, a determination is made that the
         Executive shall not be entitled to any refund of the claim and the
         Company does not notify the Executive in writing of its intent to
         contest such denial of refund of a claim prior to the expiration of
         thirty (30) days after such determination, then the portion of such
         advance attributable to a claim shall be forgiven and shall not be
         required to be repaid.  The amount of such advance attributable to a
         claim shall offset, to the extent thereof, the amount of the
         underpayment required to be paid by the Company to the Executive.  

              (v) If, after the advance by the Company of an additional amount
         necessary to obtain jurisdiction, there is a final determination made
         by the taxing authority that the Executive is not entitled to any
         refund of such amount, or any portion thereof, then such nonrefundable
         amount shall be repaid to the Company by the Executive within thirty
         (30) days after the Executive receives notice of such final
         determination.  A final determination shall occur when the period to
         contest or otherwise appeal any decision by an administrative tribunal
         or court of initial jurisdiction has been waived or the time for
         contesting or appealing the same has expired.  

         (f) LEGAL FEES AND EXPENSES.  The Company shall pay to the Executive
all legal fees and expenses as and when incurred by the Executive in connection
with this Agreement, including all such fees and expenses, if any, incurred in
contesting or disputing any Termination or in seeking to obtain or enforce any
right or benefit provided by this Agreement, regardless of the outcome, unless,
in the case of a legal action brought by or in the name of the Executive, a
decision is rendered pursuant to Section X that such action was not brought by
the Executive in good faith.  

         (g) NO MITIGATION.  The Executive shall not be required to mitigate
the amount of any payment provided for in this Section IV by seeking other
employment or otherwise, nor shall the amount of any payment or benefit provided
for in this Section IV be reduced by any compensation earned by the Executive as
the result of employment by another employer or by retirement or other benefits
received after the Termination Date or otherwise, except as specifically
provided in this Section IV.  The Company's obligation to make payments provided
for in this Agreement and otherwise to perform its obligations hereunder shall
not be affected by any set-off, counterclaim, recoupment, defense or other
claim, right or action which the Company or Employer may have against the
Executive or other parties.  

V.  DEATH AND DISABILITY BENEFITS

         In the event of the death or Disability of the Executive after a
Change of Control of the Company, the Executive, or in the case of death, the
Executive's beneficiaries, shall receive the benefits to which they are entitled
under the retirement plans, disability policies and other applicable plans or
agreements of the Company.  

VI.  SUCCESSORS; BINDING AGREEMENT

         (a) OBLIGATIONS OF SUCCESSORS.  The Company will require any successor
(whether direct or indirect, by purchase, merger, consolidation or otherwise) to
all or substantially all of the business and/or assets of the Company to
expressly assume and agree to perform this Agreement in the same manner and to
the same extent that the Company is required to perform it.  Failure of the
Company to obtain such assumption and 

                                          11

<PAGE>

agreement prior to the effectiveness of any such succession shall be a breach of
this Agreement and shall entitle the Executive to compensation from the Company
in the same amount and on the same terms as the Executive would be entitled
hereunder if the Executive had terminated his employment following a Change of
Control of the Company, except that for purposes of implementing the foregoing,
the date on which any such succession becomes effective shall be deemed the
Termination Date.  As used in this Agreement, the "Company" shall mean the
Company as hereinabove defined and any successor to its business and/or assets
as aforesaid which assumes and agrees to perform this Agreement by operation of
law, or otherwise.  

         (b) ENFORCEABLE BY BENEFICIARIES.  This Agreement shall inure to the
benefit of and be enforceable by the Executive's personal or legal
representatives, executors, administrators, successors, heirs, distributees,
devisees and legatees (the "Beneficiaries").  In the event of the death of the
Executive while any amount would still be payable hereunder if such death had
not occurred, all such amounts, unless otherwise provided herein, shall be paid
in accordance with the terms of this Agreement to the Executive's Beneficiaries.


         (c) EMPLOYMENT.  Except in the event of a Change of Control and,
thereafter, only as specifically set forth in this Agreement, nothing in this
Agreement shall be construed to (i) limit in any way the right of the Company or
a Subsidiary to terminate the Executive's employment at any time for any reason
or for no reason; or (ii) be evidence of any agreement or understanding,
expressed or implied, that the Company or a Subsidiary will employ the Executive
in any particular position, on any particular terms or at any particular rate of
remuneration.  

VII.  CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION.  

         The Executive shall hold in fiduciary capacity for the benefit of the
Company all secret or confidential information, knowledge or data relating to
the Company, the Subsidiaries and their respective businesses, which shall have
been obtained during the Executive's employment by the Employer and which shall
not be public knowledge (other than by acts by the Executive or his
representatives in violation of this Agreement).  After termination of the
Executive's employment with the Company or any Employer within the Controlled
Group, the Executive shall not, without prior written consent of the Company or
the Employer, communicate or divulge any such information, knowledge or data to
anyone other than the Company, the Employer or those designated by them.  In no
event shall an asserted violation of this Section VII constitute a basis for
deferring or withholding any amounts otherwise payable to the Executive under
this Agreement.  

VIII.  NOTICE

         All notices and communications hereunder shall be in writing and shall
be given by hand delivery to the other party, by registered or certified mail,
return receipt requested, postage prepaid, or by overnight mail, addressed as
follows:

         If to the Company:  

         U S WEST, Inc.
         7800 East Orchard Road
         Englewood, Colorado  80111
         Attn.:  Vice President - Law and Human Resources

or to such other address as either party shall have furnished to the other in
writing in accordance herewith.  Notice and communications shall be effective
when actually received by the addressee.  

IX.  MISCELLANEOUS

         No provision of this Agreement may be modified, waived or discharged
unless such waiver, modification or discharge is agreed to in writing and signed
by the Executive and the Chairman of the Human Resources Committee of the Board
of Directors.  No waiver by either party hereto at any time of any breach by the
other party hereto of, or compliance with, any conditions or provision of this
Agreement to be performed by such other party shall be deemed a waiver of
similar or dissimilar provisions or conditions at the same or at any prior or
subsequent time.  No agreements or representations, oral or otherwise, express
or implied, with respect to the subject matter hereof have been made by either
party which are not expressly set forth in this Agreement.  The validity,
interpretation, construction and performance of this Agreement shall be governed
by the laws of the State of Colorado.  All references to sections of the Code or
the Exchange Act shall be deemed also to refer to any successor provisions of
such sections.  Any payments provided for hereunder shall be paid net of any
applicable withholding required under federal, state or local law.  The
obligations of the Company under Sections IV and V shall survive the expiration
of the term of this Agreement.  

X.  VALIDITY

         The invalidity or unenforceability of any provision of this Agreement
shall not affect the validity or enforceability of any other provision of this
Agreement, which shall remain in full force and effect.  

XI.  ARBITRATION

         The Executive may agree in writing with the Company (in which case
this Article XI shall have effect but not otherwise) that any dispute that may
arise directly or indirectly in connection with this Agreement, the Executive's
employment or the termination of the Executive's employment, whether arising in
contract, statute, tort, fraud, misrepresentation, or other legal theory, shall
be determined solely by arbitration in Denver, Colorado under the rules of the
AAA.  The only legal claims between the Executive, on the one hand, and the
Company or any Subsidiary, on the other, that would not be included in this
agreement to arbitration are claims by the Executive for workers' compensation
or unemployment compensation benefits, claims for benefits under a Company or
Subsidiary benefit plan if the plan does not provide for arbitration of such
disputes, and claims by the Executive that seek judicial relief in the form of
specific performance of the right to be paid until the Termination Date during
the pendency of any dispute or controversy arising under or Subsection III(b). 
If this Article XI is in effect, any claim with respect to this Agreement, the
Executive's employment or the termination of the Executive's employment must be
established by a preponderance of the evidence submitted to the impartial
arbitrator.  A single arbitrator engaged in the practice of law shall conduct
any arbitration under the then current procedures of the American Arbitration
Association (the "AAA") and under the AAA's then current Model Employment
Arbitration Rules.  The arbitrator shall have the authority to order a
pre-hearing exchange of information by 

                                          13

<PAGE>

the parties including, without limitation, production of requested documents,
and examination by deposition of parties and their authorized agents.  If this
Article XI is in effect, the decision of the arbitrator (i) shall be final and
binding, (ii) shall be rendered within ninety (90) days after the impanelment of
the arbitrator, and (iii) shall be kept confidential by the parties to such
arbitration.  The arbitration award may be enforced in any court of competent
jurisdiction.  The Federal Arbitration Act, 9 U.S.C. 1-15, not state law, shall
govern the arbitrability of all claims.  

         If this letter sets forth our agreement on the subject matter hereof,
kindly sign both originals of this letter and return to the Vice President - Law
and Human Resources of the Company one of the fully executed originals of this
letter which will then constitute our agreement on this subject.  


Sincerely,

U S WEST, Inc.

 EXHIBIT 10AA

                [FORM OF GROUP EXECUTIVE CHANGE OF CONTROL AGREEMENT]





                             February 12, 1996



[Name]
[Title]
[Company]
7800 East Orchard Road
Englewood, Colorado  80111

Dear [Name]:

    U S WEST, Inc. (the "Company"), on behalf of itself, its subsidiaries and
its shareholders, wishes to encourage your continued service and dedication in
the performance of your duties, notwithstanding the possibility, threat or
occurrence of a Change of Control (as defined in Subsection I(h)) of the
Company.  The Board of Directors of the Company (the "Board") believes that the
prospect of a pending or threatened Change of Control inevitably creates
distractions and personal risks and uncertainties for its executives, and that
it is in the best interests of the Company to minimize such distractions to
certain executives and the Company.  The Board further believes that it is in
the best interests of the Company to encourage its executives' full attention
and dedication to their duties, both currently and in the event of any
threatened or pending Change of Control.

    Accordingly, the Board has determined that appropriate steps should be
taken to reinforce and encourage the continued retention of certain members of
the Company's management, including yourself, and the attention and dedication
of management to their assigned duties without distraction in the face of
potentially disturbing circumstances arising from the possibility of a Change of
Control of the Company.

    In order to induce you (the "Executive") to remain in the employ of the
Company and in consideration of your continued service to the Company, the
Company agrees that you shall receive the benefits set forth in this letter
agreement (the "Agreement") in the event that your employment with the Company
is terminated subsequent to a Change of Control of the Company in the
circumstances hereinafter described.  For purposes of this Agreement, references
to employment with the Company shall include employment with a Subsidiary of the
Company (as defined in Subsection I(w)).

II.  TERM OF AGREEMENT

    (a) GENERAL.  Upon execution by the Executive, this Agreement shall
commence as of February 12, 1996.  This Agreement shall continue in effect
through December 31, 1999; provided, however, that

                                          5
<PAGE>

commencing on January 1, 2000, and every third January 1 thereafter, the term of
this Agreement shall automatically be extended for three additional years
unless, not later than ninety days prior to the January 1 on which this
Agreement would otherwise automatically be extended, the Company shall have
given notice that it does not wish to extend this Agreement; provided further,
however, that if a Change of Control of the Company shall have occurred during
the original or any extended term of this Agreement, this Agreement shall
continue in effect for a period of thirty-six months beyond the month in which
the Change of Control occurred.

    (b) DISPOSITION OF EMPLOYER.  In the event the Executive is employed by a
Subsidiary, the terms of this Agreement shall expire if such Subsidiary is sold
or otherwise disposed of prior to a Change of Control unless the Executive
continues in employment with the Controlled Group after such sale or other
disposition.  If the Executive's Employer is sold or disposed of following a
Change of Control, this Agreement shall continue through its original term or
any extended term then in effect.

    (c) DEEMED CHANGE OF CONTROL.  If the Executive's employment with the
Employer is terminated prior to the date on which a Change of Control occurs,
and such termination was at the request of a third party who has taken steps to
effect a Change of Control or was otherwise caused by the Change of Control,
then for all purposes of this Agreement, a Change of Control shall be deemed to
have occurred prior to such termination.

    (d) EXPIRATION OF AGREEMENT.  No termination or expiration of this
Agreement shall affect any rights, obligations or liabilities of either party
that shall have accrued on or prior to the date of such termination or
expiration.

III.  TERMINATION FOLLOWING CHANGE OF CONTROL

    (a) ENTITLEMENT TO BENEFITS.  If a Change of Control of the Company shall
have occurred, the Executive shall be entitled to the benefits provided in
Section IV hereof upon the subsequent termination of his employment with the
Company, except as otherwise set forth below in this Subsection III(a), within
three years after the date of the Change of Control unless such termination is
(i) a result of the Executive's death or Retirement, (ii) for Cause, (iii) a
result of the Executive's Disability, or (iv) by the Executive other than for
Good Reason.  A termination of the Executive's employment which is not as a
result of the Executive's death, Retirement or Disability and (x) if by the
Company, is not for Cause, or (y) if by the Executive, is for Good Reason, shall
be referred to hereinafter as a "Termination."  The Executive shall not be
entitled to the benefits provided in Section IV hereof in the event of a Change
of Control as defined in Subsection I(h)(v)(A), I(h)(v)(B) or I(h)(v)(D), unless
that Change of Control also results in the termination of the Executive's
employment with the corporation that is created as a result of the events
leading to that Change of Control.  For purposes of the foregoing sentence only,
"termination" shall have the same definition as Termination, defined above,
except that the reference to the "Company" in subclause (x) shall mean the
corporation created by the events leading to the Change of Control.  If, in the
event of a Change of Control under Subsection I(h)(v)(A), I(h)(v)(B) or
I(h)(v)(D), the Executive's employment continues with the Company, his
entitlement to benefits shall be determined in accordance with the first
sentence of this Subsection III(a).

    (b) NOTICE OF TERMINATION.  Any purported termination of the Executive's
employment by the Company or by the Executive shall be communicated by written
Notice of Termination to the other party hereto in accordance with Section VIII.
For purposes of this Agreement, a "Notice of Termination" shall mean a notice
which shall indicate the specific provision of this Agreement relied upon and
shall set forth in reasonable detail the facts and circumstances claimed to
provide a basis for termination of the Executive's

                                          6
<PAGE>


employment under the provision so indicated.  If the Executive's employment
shall be terminated for Cause or by the Executive for other than Good Reason,
the Company shall pay the Executive his full base salary through the Termination
Date at the rate in effect at the time Notice of Termination is given and shall
pay any amounts to be paid to the Executive pursuant to any other compensation
plans, programs or employment agreements then in effect, and the Company shall
have no further obligations to the Executive under this Agreement.

    If within thirty (30) days after any Notice of Termination is given, the
party receiving such Notice notifies the other party that a dispute exists
concerning the grounds for termination, then, notwithstanding the meaning of
"Termination Date" set forth in Subsection I(z), the Termination Date shall be
the date on which the dispute is finally resolved, whether by mutual written
agreement of the parties or by a decision rendered pursuant to Section XI;
provided that the Termination Date shall be extended by a notice of dispute only
if such notice is given in good faith and the party giving such notice pursues
the resolution of such dispute with reasonable diligence.  Notwithstanding the
pendency of any such dispute, the Company will continue to pay the Executive his
full compensation in effect when the notice giving rise to the dispute was
given, and continue the Executive as a participant in all benefits plans or
perquisites in which the Executive was participating or which he was enjoying
when the Notice of Termination giving rise to the dispute was given, until the
dispute is finally resolved.  Amounts paid under this Subsection III(b) are in
addition to all other amounts due under this Agreement and shall not be offset
against or reduce any other amounts due under this Agreement.

IV.  COMPENSATION UPON A TERMINATION

    Following a Change of Control of the Company, upon a Termination of the
Executive's employment, the Executive shall be entitled to the following
benefits, provided that the Termination occurs during the three-year period
immediately following the date of the Change of Control:

    (a) STANDARD BENEFITS.  The Company shall pay the Executive his full base
salary through the Termination Date at the rate in effect at the time the Notice
of Termination is given, no later than the second day following the Termination
Date, plus all other amounts to which the Executive is entitled under any
compensation plan of the Company applicable to the Executive at the time such
payments are due.  Without limitation, amounts payable pursuant to this
Subsection IV(a) shall include, pursuant to the express terms of the short-term
incentive plan in which the Executive participates or otherwise, the Executive's
annual bonus under such short-term incentive plan, pro-rated to the Termination
Date.

    (b) ADDITIONAL BENEFITS.  The Company shall pay to the Executive as
additional pay ("Additional Pay"), the product of (i) the lesser of (x) three
(3) or (y) the difference between sixty-five (65) and the Executive's age as of
the date of the Notice of Termination (calculated to the nearest twelfth of a
year), multiplied by (ii) the sum of (x) the Executive's annual base salary rate
in effect immediately prior to the Termination Date and (y) the Executive's
annual bonus amount under the short-term incentive plan in which the Executive
participates, such bonus amount to be calculated on the basis of the extent to
which the performance factors targeted by the Human Resources Committee of the
Board have been achieved (for this purpose, the Company's performance through
the Termination Date shall be annualized based upon the actual number of days
elapsed from the beginning of the fiscal year in which the Termination occurs
through the Termination Date over a year of 360 days), which shall be deemed to
be 100% unless the performance actually achieved is greater than 100%, in which
case the actual performance levels shall be utilized.  The Company shall pay to
the Executive the Additional Pay in a lump sum, in cash, not later than the
fifteenth day following the Termination Date.

                                          7

<PAGE>


    (c) RETIREMENT PLAN BENEFITS.  If not already vested, the Executive shall
be deemed fully vested in all Company retirement plans and/or other written
agreements relating to pay upon retirement in which the Executive was a
participant, party or beneficiary immediately preceding a Change of Control, and
any additional plans and/or agreements in which such Executive became a
participant, party or beneficiary thereafter.  In addition to the foregoing, for
purposes of determining the amounts to be paid to the Executive under such plans
and/or agreements, the years of service with the Company and the age of the
Executive under all such plans and agreements shall be deemed increased by the
lesser of thirty-six (36) months or such shorter period of time as would render
the Executive sixty-five (65) years of age.  For purposes of this Subsection
IV(c), "plans" include, without limitation, the Company's qualified pension
plan, non-qualified and mid-career retirement plans, and "agreements" encompass
the terms of any offer letters leading to the Executive's employment with the
Company where the Executive was a signatory thereto and any written amendments
to the foregoing.  In the event that the terms of the plans referenced in this
Subsection IV(c) do not for any reason (e.g., if plan amendments would cause
disqualification of qualified plans) coincide with the provisions of this
Subsection IV(c), the Executive shall be entitled to receive from the Company
under the terms of this Agreement an amount equivalent to all amounts he would
have received had all such plans continued in existence as in effect on the date
of this Agreement after being amended to coincide with the terms of this
Subsection IV(c).

    (d) HEALTH BENEFITS.  Following the Termination Date, the Company shall
continue to provide health, vision and dental benefits to the Executive and the
Executive's eligible dependents on terms substantially equivalent to those on
which the Company provides such benefits to retired employees who were service
pension-eligible at the time of the Change of Control and whose retirement date
most closely approximates the date of the Change of Control.  The eligibility of
the Executive's dependents shall be determined by the terms of the health,
vision and dental benefit plans in effect prior to the Change of
Control.

    (e) GROSS-UP PAYMENTS.

         (i) In the event that any payment or the value of any benefit received
    or to be received by the Executive in connection with the Executive's
    Termination or contingent upon a Change of Control of the Company (whether
    received or to be received pursuant to the terms of this Agreement (the
    "Agreement Payments") or of any other plan, arrangement or agreement of the
    Company, its successors, any person whose actions result in a Change of
    Control of the Company or any person affiliated with any of them (or which,
    as a result of the completion of the transactions causing a Change of
    Control, will become affiliated with any of them) ("Other Payments" and,
    together with the Agreement Payments, the "Payments")) would be subject to
    the excise tax imposed by Section 4999 of the Internal Revenue Code of
    1986, as amended (the "Code") or any comparable federal, state or local
    excise tax (such excise tax, together with any interest and penalties, are
    hereinafter collectively referred to as the "Excise Tax"), as determined as
    provided below, the Company shall pay to the Executive an additional amount
    (the "Gross-Up Payment") such that the net amount retained by the
    Executive, after deduction of the Excise Tax on Agreement Payments and
    Other Payments and any federal, state and local income tax and Excise Tax
    upon the payment provided for by this Subsection IV(e)(i), and any
    interest, penalties or additions to tax payable by the Executive with
    respect thereto shall be equal to the total present value of the Agreement
    Payments and Other Payments at the time such Payments are to be made.  The
    intent of the parties is that the Company shall be solely responsible for
    and shall pay, any Excise Tax on any Payments and Gross-Up Payment and any
    income and employment taxes (including, without limitation, penalties and
    interest) imposed on any Gross-Up Payments as well as any loss of deduction
    caused by the Gross-Up Payment.

                                          8

<PAGE>

         (ii) All determinations required to be made under this Subsection
    IV(e), including, without limitation, whether and when a Gross-Up Payment
    is required and the amount of such Gross-Up Payment and the assumptions to
    be utilized in arriving at such determinations, shall be made by tax
    counsel selected by the Company and reasonably acceptable to the Executive
    ("Tax Counsel").  The Company shall cause the Tax Counsel to provide
    detailed supporting calculations to the Company and the Executive within
    fifteen (15) business days after notice is given by the Executive to the
    Company that any or all of the Payments have occurred, or such earlier time
    as is requested by the Company.  Within two (2) business days after such
    notice is given to the Company, the Company shall instruct the Tax Counsel
    to timely provide the data required by this Subsection IV(e) to the
    Executive.  All fees and expenses of the Tax Counsel shall be paid solely
    by the Company.  Any Excise Tax as determined pursuant to this Subsection
    IV(e) shall be paid by the Company to the Internal Revenue Service and/or
    other appropriate taxing authority on the Executive's behalf within five
    (5) days after receipt of the Tax Counsel's determination.  If the Tax
    Counsel determines that there is substantial authority (within the meaning
    of Section 6662 of the Code) that no Excise Tax is payable by the
    Executive, the Tax Counsel shall furnish the Executive with a written
    opinion that failure to disclose or report the Excise Tax on the
    Executive's federal income tax return will not constitute a substantial
    understatement of tax or be reasonably likely to result in the imposition
    of a negligence or similar penalty.  Any determination by the Tax Counsel
    shall be binding upon the Company and the Executive in the absence of
    material mathematical or legal error.  As a result of the uncertainty in
    the application of Section 4999 of the Code at the time the initial
    determination by the Tax Counsel hereunder, it is possible that Gross-Up
    Payments will not have been made by the Corporation that should have been
    made or that Gross-Up Payments have been made that should not have been
    made, in each case, consistent with the calculations required to be made
    hereunder.  In the event the Company exhausts its remedies pursuant to
    Subsection IV(e)(iii) below and the Executive is thereafter required to
    make a payment of any Excise Tax, the Tax Counsel shall determine the
    amount of underpayment of Excise Taxes that has occurred and any such
    underpayment shall be promptly paid by the Company to the Internal Revenue
    Service or other appropriate taxing authority on the Executive's behalf or,
    if such underpayment has been previously paid by the Executive, to the
    Executive.  In the event that the Tax Counsel determines that an
    overpayment of Gross-Up Payments has occurred, any such overpayment shall
    be treated for all purposes as a loan to the Executive with interest at the
    applicable federal rate provided for in Section 7872(f)(2) of the Code, due
    and payable within ninety (90) days after written demand to the Executive
    by the Company; provided, however, that the Executive shall have no duty or
    obligation whatsoever to repay such loan unless the Executive's receipt of
    the overpayment, or any portion thereof, is includible in the Executive's
    income and the Executive's repayment of the same is not deductible by the
    Executive for federal and state income tax purposes.

         (iii) The Executive shall notify the Company in writing of any claim
    by the Internal Revenue Service or state or local taxing authority, that,
    if successful, would result in any Excise Tax or an underpayment of Gross-
    Up Payments.  Such notice shall be given as soon as practicable but no
    later than fifteen (15) business days after the Executive is informed in
    writing of the claim and shall inform the Company of the nature of the
    claim, the administrative or judicial appeal period, and the date on which
    any payment of the claim must be paid.  The Executive shall not pay any
    portion of the claim prior to the expiration of the thirty (30) day period
    following the date on which the Executive gives such notice to the Company
    (or such shorter period ending on the date that any amount under the claim
    is due).  If the Company notifies the Executive in writing prior to the
    expiration of such thirty (30) day period that it desires to contest the
    claim, the Executive shall:

                                          9

<PAGE>

              (A) give the Company any information reasonably requested by the
         Company relating to the claim;

              (B) take such action in connection with contesting the claim as
         the Company shall reasonably request in writing from time to time,
         including, without limitation, accepting legal representation
         concerning the claim by an attorney selected by the Company who is
         reasonably acceptable to the Executive; and

              (C) cooperate with the Company in good faith in order to
         effectively contest the claim;

    provided, however, that the Company shall bear and pay directly all costs
    and expenses (including, without limitation, additional interest and
    penalties and attorneys' fees) incurred in such contests and shall
    indemnify and hold the Executive harmless, on an after-tax basis, for any
    Excise Tax or income tax (including, without limitation, interest and
    penalties thereon) imposed as a result of such representation.  Without
    limitation upon the foregoing provisions of this Subsection IV(e) (iii),
    except as provided below, the Company shall control all proceedings
    concerning such contest and, in its sole opinion, may pursue or forego any
    and all administrative appeal, proceedings, hearings and conferences with
    the taxing authority pertaining to the claim. At the written request of the
    Company and upon payment to the Executive of an amount at least equal to
    the claim plus any additional amount necessary to obtain the jurisdiction
    of the appropriate tribunal and/or court, the Executive shall pay the same
    and sue for a refund.  The Executive agrees to prosecute any contest of a
    claim to a determination before any administrative tribunal, in a court of
    initial jurisdiction and in one or more appellate courts, as the Company
    shall determine; provided, however, that if the Company requests the
    Executive to pay the claim and sue for a refund, the Company shall advance
    the amount of such payment to the Executive, on an interest-free basis, and
    shall indemnify and hold the Executive harmless on an after-tax basis, from
    any Excise Tax or income tax (including, without limitation, interest and
    penalties thereon) imposed on such advance or for any imputed income on
    such advance.  Any extension of the statute of limitations relating to
    assessment of any Excise Tax for the taxable year of the Executive which is
    the subject of the claim is to be limited solely to the claim.
    Furthermore, the Company's control of the contest shall be limited to
    issues for which a Gross-Up Payment would be payable hereunder.  The
    Executive shall be entitled to settle or contest, as the case may be, any
    other issue raised by the Internal Revenue Service or any other taxing
    authority.

         (iv) If, after the receipt by the Executive of an amount advanced by
    the Company pursuant to Subsection IV(e)(iii) above, the Executive receives
    any refund of a claim and/or any additional amount that was necessary to
    obtain jurisdiction, the Executive shall promptly pay to the Company the
    amount of such refund (together with any interest paid or credited thereon
    after taxes applicable thereto).  If, after the receipt by the Executive of
    an amount advanced by the Company pursuant to Subsection IV(e)(iii) above,
    a determination is made that the Executive shall not be entitled to any
    refund of the claim and the Company does not notify the Executive in
    writing of its intent to contest such denial of refund of a claim prior to
    the expiration of thirty (30) days after such determination, then the
    portion of such advance attributable to a claim shall be forgiven and shall
    not be required to be repaid.  The amount of such advance attributable to a
    claim shall offset, to the extent thereof, the amount of the underpayment
    required to be paid by the Company to the Executive.

         (v) If, after the advance by the Company of an additional amount
    necessary to obtain jurisdiction, there is a final determination made by
    the taxing authority that the Executive is not


                                          10
<PAGE>

    entitled to any refund of such amount, or any portion thereof, then such
    nonrefundable amount shall be repaid to the Company by the Executive within
    thirty (30) days after the Executive receives notice of such final
    determination.  A final determination shall occur when the period to
    contest or otherwise appeal any decision by an administrative tribunal or
    court of initial jurisdiction has been waived or the time for contesting or
    appealing the same has expired.

    (f) LEGAL FEES AND EXPENSES.  The Company shall pay to the Executive all
legal fees and expenses as and when incurred by the Executive in connection with
this Agreement, including all such fees and expenses, if any, incurred in
contesting or disputing any Termination or in seeking to obtain or enforce any
right or benefit provided by this Agreement, regardless of the outcome, unless,
in the case of a legal action brought by or in the name of the Executive, a
decision is rendered pursuant to Section X that such action was not brought by
the Executive in good faith.

    (g) NO MITIGATION.  The Executive shall not be required to mitigate the
amount of any payment provided for in this Section IV by seeking other
employment or otherwise, nor shall the amount of any payment or benefit provided
for in this Section IV be reduced by any compensation earned by the Executive as
the result of employment by another employer or by retirement or other benefits
received after the Termination Date or otherwise, except as specifically
provided in this Section IV.  The Company's obligation to make payments provided
for in this Agreement and otherwise to perform its obligations hereunder shall
not be affected by any set-off, counterclaim, recoupment, defense or other
claim, right or action which the Company or Employer may have against the
Executive or other parties.

V.  DEATH AND DISABILITY BENEFITS

    In the event of the death or Disability of the Executive after a Change of
Control of the Company, the Executive, or in the case of death, the Executive's
beneficiaries, shall receive the benefits to which they are entitled under the
retirement plans, disability policies and other applicable plans or agreements
of the Company.

VI.  SUCCESSORS; BINDING AGREEMENT

    (a) OBLIGATIONS OF SUCCESSORS.  The Company will require any successor
(whether direct or indirect, by purchase, merger, consolidation or otherwise) to
all or substantially all of the business and/or assets of the Company to
expressly assume and agree to perform this Agreement in the same manner and to
the same extent that the Company is required to perform it.  Failure of the
Company to obtain such assumption and agreement prior to the effectiveness of
any such succession shall be a breach of this Agreement and shall entitle the
Executive to compensation from the Company in the same amount and on the same
terms as the Executive would be entitled hereunder if the Executive had
terminated employment for Good Reason following a Change of Control of the
Company, except that for purposes of implementing the foregoing, the date on
which any such succession becomes effective shall be deemed the Termination
Date.  As used in this Agreement, the "Company" shall mean the Company as
hereinabove defined and any successor to its business and/or assets as aforesaid
which assumes and agrees to perform this Agreement by operation of law, or
otherwise.

    (b) ENFORCEABLE BY BENEFICIARIES.  This Agreement shall inure to the
benefit of and be enforceable by the Executive's personal or legal
representatives, executors, administrators, successors, heirs, distributees,
devisees and legatees (the "Beneficiaries").  In the event of the death of the
Executive while any amount would still be payable hereunder if such death had
not occurred, all such amounts, unless


                                          11
<PAGE>

otherwise provided herein, shall be paid in accordance with the terms of this
Agreement to the Executive's Beneficiaries.

    (c) EMPLOYMENT.  Except in the event of a Change of Control and,
thereafter, only as specifically set forth in this Agreement, nothing in this
Agreement shall be construed to (i) limit in any way the right of the Company or
a Subsidiary to terminate the Executive's employment at any time for any reason
or for no reason; or (ii) be evidence of any agreement or understanding,
expressed or implied, that the Company or a Subsidiary will employ the Executive
in any particular position, on any particular terms or at any particular rate of
remuneration.

VII.  CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION.

    The Executive shall hold in fiduciary capacity for the benefit of the
Company all secret or confidential information, knowledge or data relating to
the Company, the Subsidiaries and their respective businesses, which shall have
been obtained during the Executive's employment by the Employer and which shall
not be public knowledge (other than by acts by the Executive or his
representatives in violation of this Agreement).  After termination of the
Executive's employment with the Company or any Employer within the Controlled
Group, the Executive shall not, without prior written consent of the Company or
the Employer, communicate or divulge any such information, knowledge or data to
anyone other than the Company, the Employer or those designated by them.  In no
event shall an asserted violation of this Section VII constitute a basis for
deferring or withholding any amounts otherwise payable to the Executive under
this Agreement.

VIII.  NOTICE

    All notices and communications hereunder shall be in writing and shall be
given by hand delivery to the other party, by registered or certified mail,
return receipt requested, postage prepaid, or by overnight mail, addressed as

IX.  MISCELLANEOUS

    No provision of this Agreement may be modified, waived or discharged unless
such waiver, modification or discharge is agreed to in writing and signed by the
Executive and the Company's Chief Executive Officer.  No waiver by either party
hereto at any time of any breach by the other party hereto of, or compliance
with, any conditions or provision of this Agreement to be performed by such
other party shall be deemed a waiver of similar or dissimilar provisions or
conditions at the same or at any prior or subsequent time.  No agreements or
representations, oral or otherwise, express or implied, with respect to the
subject matter hereof have been made by either party which are not expressly set
forth in this Agreement.  The validity, interpretation, construction and
performance of this Agreement shall be governed by the laws of the State of
Colorado.  All references to sections of the Code or the Exchange Act shall be
deemed also to refer to any successor provisions of such sections.  Any payments
provided for hereunder shall be paid net of any applicable withholding required
under federal, state or local law.  The obligations of the Company under
Sections IV and V shall survive the expiration of the term of this Agreement.

X.  VALIDITY

    The invalidity or unenforceability of any provision of this Agreement shall
not affect the validity or enforceability of any other provision of this
Agreement, which shall remain in full force and effect.

XI.  ARBITRATION

    The Executive may agree in writing with the Company (in which case this
Article XI shall have effect but not otherwise) that any dispute that may arise
directly or indirectly in connection with this Agreement, the Executive's
employment or the termination of the Executive's employment, whether arising in
contract, statute, tort, fraud, misrepresentation, or other legal theory, shall
be determined solely by arbitration in Denver, Colorado under the rules of the
AAA.  The only legal claims between the Executive, on the one hand, and the
Company or any Subsidiary, on the other, that would not be included in this
agreement to arbitration are claims by the Executive for workers' compensation
or unemployment compensation benefits, claims for benefits under a Company or
Subsidiary benefit plan if the plan does not provide for arbitration of such
disputes, and claims by the Executive that seek judicial relief in the form of
specific performance of the right to be paid until the Termination Date during
the pendency of any dispute or controversy arising under or Subsection III(b).
If this Article XI is in effect, any claim with respect to this Agreement, the
Executive's employment or the termination of the Executive's employment must be
established by a preponderance of the evidence submitted to the impartial
arbitrator.  A single arbitrator engaged in the practice of law shall conduct
any arbitration under the then current procedures of the American Arbitration
Association (the "AAA") and under the AAA's then current Model Employment
Arbitration Rules.  The arbitrator shall have the authority to order a pre-
hearing exchange of information by the parties including, without limitation,
production of requested documents, and examination by deposition of parties and
their authorized agents.  If this Article XI is in effect, the decision of the
arbitrator (i) shall be final and binding, (ii) shall be rendered within ninety
(90) days after the impanelment of the arbitrator, and (iii) shall be kept
confidential by the parties to such arbitration.  The arbitration award may be
enforced in any court of competent jurisdiction.  The Federal Arbitration Act, 9
U.S.C. 1-15, not state law, shall govern the arbitrability of all claims.

with the CONDITIONS, the U S WEST company that Executive is employed by
immediately prior to his DISCHARGE FROM EMPLOYMENT shall pay Executive in United
States dollars in the United States the SEVERANCE PAYMENT, as applicable, in
appreciation for his many years of service to U S WEST, substantially all of
which service was rendered by Executive over many years in the United States.

Applicable state and federal withholding taxes will be deducted from the gross
amount of this severance.  None of the payments pursuant to this paragraph shall
be included in the calculation of Executive's pension or savings benefits with U
S WEST.

          2.   Within thirty (30) days after the CONDITIONS have been satisfied,
the U S WEST company that Executive is employed by immediately prior to his
DISCHARGE FROM EMPLOYMENT shall pay to Executive a sum equal to (a) a pro rata
portion of the amount that would have been payable to Executive, if any, under
the STIP at target and (b) a pro rata portion of the cash value, if any, of the
amount that would have been payable to Executive under the LTIP at target.  In
the event any of such plans have been modified or amended prior to the date of
DISCHARGE FROM EMPLOYMENT, the terms of the modified or amended plans shall
control.  In determining the "target" for the 1996 LTIP,  it will be assumed
that the 1996 LTIP Total Shareowners' Return ("TSR") is 13.5 %. The amount of
the STIP payments payable hereunder may be determined by U S WEST in accordance
with any criteria then in place.  The amount of any STIP payments made to
Executive pursuant to this Agreement will be included in the calculation of
Executive's nonqualified pension benefits.

          3.   Within  thirty (30) days after the CONDITIONS  are satisfied, the
U S WEST company that Executive is employed by immediately prior to his
DISCHARGE FROM EMPLOYMENT shall pay to the Executive (less applicable taxes), an
amount equal to the balance available to Executive for financial counseling
services for the remainder of the year of the Executive's termination and will
pay to Executive (less applicable taxes), the amount available for financial
counseling services for the following year.  In the alternative, if U S WEST is
providing financial counseling services to the Executive at a group rate, U S
WEST will maintain in place the level of financial counseling services paid for
by U S WEST for the remainder of the year of Executive's termination and for the
following year.

                             Stock and Stock Options

          4.   All restrictions applicable to any stock granted by U S WEST  to
Executive under the LTIP shall lapse sixteen (16) days after execution of the
WAIVER & RELEASE and the CONDITIONS are satisfied. All restrictions applicable
to any stock granted by U S WEST to executive under the STOCK PLAN after
February 15, 1996, shall lapse in accordance with the terms of such grants and,
if applicable, sixteen (16) days after execution of the WAIVER & RELEASE and the
CONDITIONS are satisfied.

          5.   (a)  Pursuant to the terms of the STOCK PLAN, the Human Resources
Committee of the U S WEST, Inc. Board of Directors has the sole discretion to
alter or amend the vesting schedule of any stock options or stock appreciation
rights granted under the STOCK PLAN prior to October 31, 1995.  A pro rata
portion of stock options and stock appreciation rights (rounded up to the
nearest whole option) issued to Executive on or after October 31, 1995 under the
STOCK PLAN that are not exercisable on the date of DISCHARGE FROM EMPLOYMENT
shall become fully exercisable sixteen  (16) days after execution of the WAIVER
& RELEASE by Executive and after the CONDITIONS are satisfied. Such pro rata
portion shall be determined on a monthly basis by multiplying the number of
options in any grant by a fraction, the numerator of which is the number


                                        4
<PAGE>


of full months from grant date to the date of termination and the denominator of
which is the original vesting schedule of the grant.

               (b)  If Executive's DISCHARGE FROM EMPLOYMENT is concurrent with
Executive's retirement from employment as defined in the STOCK PLAN, Executive
shall have the right to elect to have Executive's stock options governed by the
provisions of II. H. 5. (a) above or by the terms of the agreement under which
the options were granted. If Executive fails to make such an election within
thirty (30) days after the notice of Executive's DISCHARGE FROM EMPLOYMENT,  the
stock options will be governed by II. H. 5 (a) above.

          6.   Provided Executive does not go into business in competition with
U S WEST or become employed by a firm engaged in such competition, as determined
in the sole discretion of the Human Resources Committee of the Board of
Directors of U S WEST, Inc. or its designee, Executive shall have the right, at
any time  up to three (3)  years after  the date of his DISCHARGE FROM
EMPLOYMENT (but in no event after the expiration date of the applicable stock
options and stock appreciation rights), to exercise stock options and stock
appreciation rights held as of the date of DISCHARGE FROM EMPLOYMENT.  In the
event Executive does go into business in competition with U S WEST or becomes
employed by a firm that is engaged in such competition within the three (3) year
period, Executive shall have ninety (90) days after the date that he becomes
employed in the competitive position to exercise any stock options and stock
appreciation rights that have not previously expired to the extent that such
stock options and stock appreciation rights are then otherwise exercisable.

                       Medical, Dental and Vision Benefits

          7.   The U S WEST company that Executive is an employee of immediately
prior to his DISCHARGE FROM EMPLOYMENT shall take such steps as are necessary to
permit the Executive to continue, in full force and effect and "AT U S WEST'S
EXPENSE" for the "APPLICABLE PERIOD," medical, dental and vision benefits for
Executive and the Executive's dependents on the same basis as if Executive had
remained an active employee during such applicable period; provided, however,
that all rights to such benefits (except the right to continue health plan
coverage at the Executive's own expense under COBRA) shall terminate if the
CONDITIONS are not satisfied within ninety (90) days after the date of
Executive's DISCHARGE FROM EMPLOYMENT with U S WEST.

                            Career Guidance Services

          8.   The U S WEST company that Executive is an employee of immediately
prior to his DISCHARGE FROM EMPLOYMENT shall take such steps as are necessary to
provide career guidance services to Executive through an outside consulting firm
selected by U S WEST; provided, however, that U S WEST may terminate such
services if the CONDITIONS are not satisfied within ninety (90) days of the date
of his DISCHARGE FROM EMPLOYMENT.  U S WEST will have sole discretion to
determine the exact amounts of career guidance services that will be provided,
and Executive does not have any right to receive a cash payment in lieu of
career guidance services.

<PAGE>


any time during the three (3) months immediately preceding Executive's
termination of employment.

     F.   ARBITRATION OF  DISPUTES.

          1.   Any claim, controversy or dispute between Executive and U S WEST,
whether sounding in contract, statute, tort, fraud, misrepresentation,
discrimination or any other legal theory, including, but not limited to,
disputes relating to the interpretation of this Agreement; claims under Title
VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, as amended; claims under the Civil Rights
Act of 1991; claims under the Age Discrimination in Employment Act of 1967, as
amended; claims under 42 U.S.C. Section 1981, Section 1981a, Section 1983,
Section 1985, or Section 1988; claims under the Family and Medical Leave Act of
1993; claims under the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990, as amended;
claims under the Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938, as amended; claims under the
Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, as amended; claims under the
Colorado Anti-Discrimination Act; or claims under any other similar federal,
state or local law or regulation, whenever brought, shall be resolved by
arbitration. The only legal claims between Executive and U S WEST that are not
included for arbitration within this Agreement are claims by Executive for
workers' compensation or unemployment compensation benefits and/or claims for
benefits under  any U S WEST benefit plan, if the plan does not provide for
arbitration of such disputes. BY SIGNING THIS AGREEMENT, EXECUTIVE VOLUNTARILY,
KNOWINGLY AND INTELLIGENTLY WAIVES ANY RIGHT HE MAY OTHERWISE HAVE TO SEEK
REMEDIES IN COURT OR OTHER FORUMS, INCLUDING THE RIGHT TO A JURY TRIAL AND THE
RIGHT TO RECOVER PUNITIVE DAMAGES ON ANY COMMON LAW AND/OR CONTRACT CLAIMS. The
Federal Arbitration Act, 9 U.S.C. Sections 1-16 ("FAA") shall govern the
arbitrability of all claims, provided that they are enforceable under the FAA,
as it may be amended from time to time.  In the event the FAA does not govern,
the Colorado Uniform Arbitration Act shall apply.  Additionally, the substantive
law of Colorado, to the extent it is consistent with the terms stated in this
Agreement for arbitration, shall apply to any common law claims.  This Agreement
for arbitration supersedes any other arbitration agreement Executive and U S
WEST to the extent they are inconsistent.

          2.   A single arbitrator engaged in the practice of law shall conduct
the arbitration under the applicable rules and procedures of the American
Arbitration Association ("AAA").  Any dispute, that relates directly or
indirectly Executive's employment with U S WEST or to the termination of
Executive's employment will be conducted under the AAA Employment Dispute
Resolution Rules, effective November 1993.  The arbitrator shall be chosen from
a state other than Executive's state of residence and other than Colorado.
Other than as set forth herein, the arbitrator shall have no authority to add
to, detract from, change, amend, or modify existing law.  All arbitration
proceedings, including without limitation, settlements and awards, under this
Agreement will be confidential.  The parties shall share equally the hourly fees
of the arbitrator. U S WEST shall pay the expenses (such as travel and lodging)
of the arbitrator. The prevailing party in any arbitration may be entitled to
receive reasonable attorneys' fees. The arbitrator's decision and award shall be
final and binding, as to all claims that were, or could have been, raised in the
arbitration, and judgment upon the award rendered by the arbitrator may be
entered to any court having jurisdiction thereof.  If any party hereto files a
judicial or administrative action asserting claims subject to this arbitration
provision, and another


                                        9
<PAGE>


party successfully stays such action and/or compels arbitration of such claims,
the party filing said action shall pay the other party's costs and expenses
incurred in seeking such stay and/or compelling arbitration, including
reasonable attorneys' fees.

                            IV. ADDITIONAL PROVISIONS

     A.   BINDING EFFECT.  This Agreement shall bind and benefit the heirs, 
personal representatives, administrators, successors, subsidiaries, 
affiliates and assigns of U S WEST and Executive.

     B.   CHANGE OF CONTROL.  If Executive and U S WEST, Inc. have entered into
a Change of Control Agreement that is in force on the date that a "change of
control" (as defined in the Change of Control Agreement) of U S WEST, Inc.
occurs and Executive is entitled to and elects to receive benefits under the
Change of Control Agreement, the terms of the Change of Control Agreement shall
supersede this Agreement, whether the Change of Control Agreement was signed
prior to or subsequent to the execution of this Agreement, and Executive will
not be entitled to SEVERANCE BENEFITS under this Agreement.

     C.   ENTIRE UNDERSTANDING.  This Agreement contains the entire
understanding of the parties with respect to the matters addressed herein and
supersedes all prior representations, understandings and agreements of the
parties with respect thereto, with the following exception.  In the event a
court declares the arbitration provisions of this Agreement to be unenforceable
for any reason, any prior agreement by Executive to submit employment disputes
to arbitration shall remain enforceable.  This Agreement may be modified only by
a written agreement executed by both Executive and an authorized officer of U S
WEST.

     D.   GOVERNING LAW. Except as otherwise specifically stated for any
provision of this Agreement, the substantive law of Colorado, only to the extent
it is consistent with the terms stated herein, shall apply to any claims between
the parties to the extent not preempted by ERISA or other applicable federal
law.

     E.   NOTICES.  All notices and communications required by this Agreement
shall be in writing and delivered by hand delivery, by registered or certified
mail, return receipt requested, postage prepaid, or by overnight mail, addressed
as follows:

          To Executive:

          _______________________________
          _______________________________
          _______________________________

          To U S WEST:

          7800 East Orchard Road, Room 200
          Englewood, CO  80111

or to such other address as either party shall have furnished to the other in
writing in accordance herewith.  Notice and communications shall be effective
when actually received by the addressee.

     F.   AVAILABILITY OF INJUNCTIVE RELIEF.  The parties agree that U S WEST
would suffer irreparable injury if Executive breaches his responsibilities
relating to the return and protection of COMPANY INFORMATION or COMPANY PROPERTY
and that the injury would not be compensable fully in monetary damages.
Accordingly, in the event Executive breaches or threatens to breach that
condition, the arbitration provisions of this Agreement shall not prevent
U S WEST or Executive from obtaining injunctive relief from a court of competent
jurisdiction to enforce the obligations relating to the return and protection of
COMPANY INFORMATION or COMPANY PROPERTY, pending decision on the merits by the
arbitrator.

     G.   WAIVER OF BREACH.  The waiver by either U S WEST or Executive of a
breach of any provision of this Agreement shall not operate or be construed as a
waiver of any prior or subsequent breach by either party.

     H.   SEVERABILITY.

          1.    In case any one or more of the provisions of this Agreement
shall be found to be invalid, illegal or unenforceable for any reason, the
validity, legality and enforceability of the remaining provisions and/or clauses
contained herein shall not in any way be affected or impaired thereby.  Any
clause and/or provision that is found to be invalid, illegal or unenforceable
shall be deemed, without further action on the part of the parties hereto, to be
modified, amended and/or limited to the minimum extent necessary to render such
clauses and/or provisions valid and enforceable.  A claim by either party that
any provision of this Agreement is invalid, illegal or unenforceable shall be
determined by an arbitrator under the arbitration provisions of this Agreement.
In the event an arbitrator determines that any provision of this Agreement is
invalid, illegal or unenforceable for any reason, it is the mutual desire of the
parties that the arbitrator reform the Agreement to the minimum extent necessary
to render such provision valid and enforceable and direct the parties to comply
with the requirements of this Agreement as modified.

          2.   To the extent the arbitration provisions of any prior agreement
between the parties are inconsistent with the arbitration provisions in the
Agreement or incorporated herein, the arbitration provisions of this Agreement
shall supersede the conflicting terms, with the sole exception of the
arbitration provisions contained in any change of control Agreement between the
parties that is governed by section IV(B) of this Agreement. In the event a
court or arbitrator concludes that the arbitration provisions of this Agreement
are not enforceable, then any agreement executed by the parties prior to the
execution of this Agreement that provides for the arbitration of disputes shall
be fully enforceable.

     I.   EXPATRIATE AGREEMENTS. This Agreement shall control if there is any
conflict between the terms of the Expatriate Agreement and this Agreement with
the exception of any


                                       11
<PAGE>


specially negotiated and duly executed short or long term incentive agreements.
Executive agrees that this Agreement provides the only severance benefits and
compensation for the Executive in the event of Executive's DISCHARGE FROM
EMPLOYMENT and supersedes and replaces the obligations of U S WEST in the
"Company initiated termination" or similar provisions under any Expatriate
Agreement.

                                        17

par value $1.00 per share, of Acquiror (the "Series D Preferred Stock"), having

            (x)  for each such share of Class B Common Stock with respect to
      which an election to receive cash has been effectively made and not
      revoked, pursuant to Sections 3.2(c), (d) and (e) (a "Cash Election"), the
      right to receive an amount in cash from Acquiror, without interest, equal

of the holder thereof, at the Effective Time all shares of Company Common Stock
shall cease to be outstanding and shall be cancelled and retired and shall cease

(a "Company Certificate").  The Media Stock and Series D Preferred Stock
comprising part of the Merger Consideration, when issued to the holders of
Company Common Stock, will be duly authorized, validly issued, fully paid,
non-assessable and not subject to preemptive rights created by statute,
Acquiror's Restated Certificate of Incorporation or Bylaws or any agreement to
which Acquiror is a party or by which Acquiror is bound.

            (d)   CERTAIN ADJUSTMENTS AND DETERMINATIONS. (i)If, between the
date of this Agreement and the Effective Time, the outstanding shares of Media
Stock, Series D Preferred Stock or Company Common Stock shall have been changed
into a different number of shares or a different class, by reason of any stock
dividend, subdivision, reclassification, recapitalization, split, combination or
exchange of shares, the Common Conversion Number and the Preferred Conversion
Number correspondingly shall be adjusted to reflect such stock dividend,
subdivision, reclassification, recapitalization, split, combination or exchange
of shares.

            (ii)  The Class A Common Conversion Number and Class B Common
Conversion Number shall be determined in the following manner:

            (A)   If the Determination Price is greater than or equal to the
Floor Price and less than or equal to the Cap Price, (x) the Class A Common
Conversion Number shall be equal to the quotient of (1) the product of (i) the
Class A Common Percentage multiplied by (ii) the Share Price divided by (2) the
Determination Price (rounded to the nearest hundredth, or if there shall not be
a nearest hundredth, to the next lowest hundredth) and (y) the Class B Common
Conversion Number shall be equal to the quotient of (1) the product of (i) the
Class B Common Percentage multiplied by (ii) the Share Price divided by (2) the
Determination Price (rounded to the nearest hundredth, or if there shall not be
a nearest hundredth, to the next lowest hundredth).

            (B)   If the Determination Price is less than the Floor Price, (x)
the Class A Common Conversion Number shall be equal to the quotient of (1) the
product of (I) the Class A Common Percentage multiplied by (II) the Share Price
divided by (2) the Floor Price (rounded to the nearest hundredth, or if there
shall not be a nearest hundredth, to the next lowest hundredth) and (y) the
Class B Common Conversion Number shall be equal to the quotient of (1) the


                                        19 

<PAGE>

product of (I) the Class B Common Percentage multiplied by (II) the Share Price
divided by (2) the Floor Price (rounded to the nearest hundredth, or if there
shall not be a nearest hundredth, to the next lowest hundredth); PROVIDED,
HOWEVER, that in such event Acquiror shall have the right to give written
notice to the Company (the "Floor Top-Up Intent Notice") that the board of
directors of Acquiror elects to increase both (x) the Class A Common Conversion
Number to the quotient of (1) the product of (I) the Class A Common Percentage
multiplied by (II) the Share Price divided by (2) the Determination Price
(rounded to the nearest hundredth, or if there shall not be a nearest hundredth,
to the next lowest hundredth) and (y) the Class B Common Conversion Number to
the quotient of (1) the product of (I) the Class B Common Percentage multiplied
by (II) the Share Price divided by (2) the Determination Price (rounded to the
nearest hundredth, or if there shall not be a nearest hundredth, to the next
lowest hundredth).  The Floor Top-Up Intent Notice shall be delivered to the
Company no later than 2:00 p.m. on the second Business Day prior to the Closing
Date.  If, in such case, Acquiror does not deliver a Floor Top-Up Intent Notice,
the Company shall have the right to give written notice to Acquiror (the
"Company Termination Notice") that the Company  elects to terminate this
Agreement.  The Company Termination Notice shall be delivered to Acquiror no
later than 2:00 p.m. on the Business Day prior to the Closing Date.

            (c)  If the Determination Price is greater than the Cap Price, (x)
the Class A Common Conversion Number shall be equal to the quotient of (1) the
product of (I) the Class A Common Percentage multiplied by (II) the Share Price
divided by (2) the Cap Price (rounded to the nearest hundredth, or if there
shall not be a nearest hundredth, to the next lowest hundredth) and (y) the
Class B Common Conversion Number shall be equal to the quotient of (1) the
product of (I) the Class B Common Percentage multiplied by (II) the Share Price
divided by (2) the Cap Price (rounded to the nearest hundredth, or if there
shall not be a nearest hundredth, to the next lowest hundredth); PROVIDED,
HOWEVER,  that in such event, the Company shall have the right to give written
notice to Acquiror (the "Cap Top-Up Intent Notice") that the Board of Directors
elects to decrease both (x) the Class A Common Conversion Number to the quotient
of (1) the product of (I) the Class A Common Percentage multiplied by (II) the
Share Price divided by (2) the Determination Price (rounded to the nearest
hundredth, or if there shall not be a nearest hundredth, to the next lowest
hundredth) and


                                        20 

<PAGE>

(y) the Class B Common Conversion Number to the quotient of (1) the product of
(I) the Class B Common Percentage multiplied by (II) the Share Price divided by
(2) the Determination Price (rounded to the nearest hundredth, or if there shall
not be a nearest hundredth, to the next lowest hundredth).  The Cap Top-Up
Intent Notice shall be delivered to Acquiror no later than 2:00 p.m. on the
second Business Day prior to the Closing Date.  If, in such case, the Company
does not deliver a Cap Top-Up Intent Notice, Acquiror shall have the right to
give written notice to the Company (the "Acquiror Termination Notice") that
Acquiror elects to terminate this Agreement.  The Acquiror Termination Notice
shall be delivered to the Company no later than 2:00 p.m. on the Business Day
prior to the Closing Date.

            3.2   COMPANY COMMON STOCK ELECTIONS; EXCHANGE FUND.  (a)  Each
Person who, at the Effective Time, is a record holder of shares of Class B
Common Stock (other than holders of shares of Class B Common Stock to be
cancelled as set forth in Section 3.1(b) or subject to Section 3.5 or 3.6) shall
have the right to submit an Election Form (as defined in Section 3.2(c))
specifying the number of shares of Class B Common Stock that such Person desires
to have converted into the right to receive the Class B Stock Consideration (the
"Stock Election") and the number of shares of Class B Common Stock that such
Person desires to have converted into the right to receive the Class B Cash
Consideration pursuant to the Class B Cash Election.

            (b)  Promptly after the Allocation Determination (as defined in
Section 3.2(d)), (i) Acquiror shall deposit (or cause to be deposited) with a
bank or trust company to be designated by Acquiror and reasonably acceptable to
the Company (the "Exchange Agent"), for the benefit of the holders of shares of
Class B Common Stock, for exchange in accordance with this Article III, cash in
the amount sufficient to pay the aggregate Class B Cash Consideration and (ii)
Acquiror shall deposit (or cause to be deposited) with the Exchange Agent, for
the benefit of holders of shares of Company Common Stock, certificates
representing the shares of Media Stock and Series D Preferred Stock ("Acquiror
Certificates") for exchange in accordance with this Article III (the cash and
shares deposited pursuant to clauses (i) and (ii) being hereinafter referred to
as the "Exchange Fund").  The Media Stock and Series D Preferred Stock into
which Company Common Stock shall be converted


                                        21 

<PAGE>

pursuant to the Merger shall be deemed to have been issued at the Effective
Time.

            (c)  As soon as reasonably practicable after the Effective Time, the
Exchange Agent shall mail to each holder of record of Company Common Stock
immediately prior to the Effective Time (excluding any shares of Company Common
Stock which will be cancelled pursuant to Section 3.1(b) or which are subject to
Section 3.5 or 3.6) (A) a letter of transmittal (the "Company Letter of
Transmittal") (which shall specify that delivery shall be effected, and risk of
loss and title to the Company Certificates shall pass, only upon delivery of
such Company Certificates to the Exchange Agent and shall be in such form and
have such other provisions as Acquiror shall specify) and (B) instructions for
use in effecting the surrender of the Company Certificates in exchange for the
Class A Merger Consideration or Class B Merger Consideration, as applicable,
with respect to the shares of Company Common Stock formerly represented thereby.
The Exchange Agent shall also mail to holders of Class B Common Stock, together
with the items specified in the preceding sentence, an election form (the
"Election Form") providing for such holders to make the Cash Election or the
Stock Election.  The Election Form shall include information as to the Share
Price, the Class B Common Conversion Number, the Class B Preferred Conversion
Number and the Cash Consideration Amount and state the pricing terms of the
Series D Preferred Stock.  As of the Election Deadline (as hereinafter defined)
all holders of Class B Common Stock immediately prior to the Effective Time that
shall not have submitted to the Exchange Agent or shall have properly revoked an
effective, properly completed Election Form shall be deemed to have made a Stock
Election.

            (d)  Any Cash Election or Stock Election (other than a deemed Stock
Election) shall have been validly made only if the Exchange Agent shall have
received by 5:00 p.m. New York, New York time on a date (the "Election
Deadline") to be mutually agreed upon by Acquiror and the Company (which date
shall not be later than the twentieth Business Day after the Effective Time), an
Election Form properly completed and executed (with the signature or signatures
thereof guaranteed to the extent required by the Election Form) by such holder
accompanied by such holder's Company Certificates, or by an appropriate
guarantee of delivery of such Company Certificates from a member of any
registered national securities exchange or of the National Association


                                        22 

<PAGE>

of Securities Dealers, Inc. or a commercial bank or trust company in the United
States as set forth in such Election Form.  Any holder of Class B Common Stock
(other than a holder who has submitted an irrevocable election) who has made an
election by submitting an Election Form to the Exchange Agent may at any time
prior to the Election Deadline change such holder's election by submitting a
revised Election Form, properly completed and signed that is received by the
Exchange Agent prior to the Election Deadline.  Any holder of Class B Common
Stock may at any time prior to the Election Deadline revoke such holder's
election by written notice to the Exchange Agent received by the Close of
business on the day prior to the Election Deadline.  As soon as practicable
after the Election Deadline, the Exchange Agent shall determine the allocation
of the cash portion of the Class B Merger Consideration and the stock portion of
the Class B Merger Consideration and shall notify Acquiror of its determination
(the "Allocation Determination").

            (e)  Upon surrender of a Company Certificate for cancellation to the
Exchange Agent, together with the Company Letter of Transmittal, duly executed,
and such other documents as Acquiror or the Exchange Agent shall reasonably
request, the holder of such Company Certificate shall be entitled to receive
promptly after the Election Deadline in exchange therefor (A) a certified or
bank cashier's check in the amount equal to the cash, if any, which such holder
has the right to receive pursuant to the provisions of this Article III
(including any cash in lieu of fractional shares of Media Stock and Series D
Preferred Stock pursuant to Section 3.4(c)), and (B) Acquiror Certificates
representing that number of shares of Media Stock and Series D Preferred Stock,
if any, which such holder has the right to receive pursuant to this Article III
(in each case less the amount of any required withholding taxes, if any,
determined in accordance with Section 3.4(g)), and the Company Certificate so
surrendered shall forthwith be cancelled.  Until surrendered as contemplated by
this Section 3.3, each Company Certificate shall be deemed at any time after the
Effective Time to represent only the right to receive the Class A Merger
Consideration or Class B Merger Consideration, as applicable, with respect to
the shares of Company Common Stock formerly represented thereby.

            (f)  Acquiror shall have the right to make reasonable rules, not
inconsistent with the terms of this Agreement, governing the validity of the
Election Forms, the


                                        23 

<PAGE>

manner and extent to which Cash Elections or Stock Elections are to be taken
into account in making the determinations prescribed by Section 3.3, the
issuance and delivery of certificates for Media Stock and Series D Preferred
Stock into which shares of Class B Common Stock are converted in the Merger, and
the payment of cash for shares of Class B Common Stock converted into the right
to receive cash in the Merger.

            3.3   PRORATION.  (a)  The aggregate amount of cash to be paid to
holders of Class B Common Stock (the "Cash Cap") shall not exceed the Cash
Consideration Amount.

            (b)  In the event that the aggregate amount of cash represented by
the Cash Elections received by the Exchange Agent (the "Requested Cash Amount")
exceeds the Cash Cap, each holder making a Cash Election shall receive, for each
share of Class B Common Stock for which a Cash Election has been made, (x) cash
in an amount equal to the product of the Class B Cash Consideration and a
fraction, the numerator of which is the Cash Cap and the denominator of which is
the Requested Cash Amount (such product, the "Prorated Cash Amount"), (y) a
number of shares of Media Stock equal to the product of the Class B Common
Percentage and a fraction, the numerator of which is equal to the Share Price
minus the Prorated Cash Amount and the denominator of which is the Calculation
Price and (z) a number of shares of Series D Preferred Stock equal to the
product of the Class B Preferred Percentage and a fraction, the numerator of
which is equal to the Share Price minus the Prorated Cash Amount and the
denominator of which is equal to the Liquidation Value.

            (c)  In the event the Requested Cash Amount is less than the Cash
Cap, each holder making a Stock Election (other than as set forth in Section
3.5) shall receive for each share of Class B Common Stock for which a Stock
Election has been made, (x) cash in an amount equal to the quotient of (1) the
excess of the Cash Cap over the Requested Cash Amount divided by (2) the number
of shares of Class B Common Stock for which such Stock Elections have been made
or have been deemed to have been made (such quotient, the "Excess Cash Amount"),
(y) a number of shares of Media Stock equal to the product of the Class B Common
Percentage and a fraction, the numerator of which is equal to the difference
between the Share Price and the Excess Cash Amount and the denominator of which
is equal to the Calculation Price and (z) a number of shares of Series D

<PAGE>

Preferred Stock equal to the product of the Class B Preferred Percentage and a
fraction, the numerator of which is equal to the difference between the Share
Price and the Excess Cash Amount and the denominator of which is equal to the
Liquidation Value.

            3.4   DIVIDENDS, FRACTIONAL SHARES, ETC. (a) Notwithstanding any
other provisions of this Agreement, no dividends or other distributions declared
after the Effective Time on Media Stock or Series D Preferred Stock shall be
paid with respect to any whole shares of Media Stock or Series D Preferred Stock
represented by a Company Certificate until such Company Certificate is
surrendered for exchange as provided herein.  Subject to the effect of
Applicable Laws, following surrender of any such Company Certificate, there
shall be paid to the holder of the Acquiror Certificates issued in exchange
therefor, without interest, (i) at the time of such surrender, the amount of
dividends or other distributions with a record date after the Effective Time
theretofore payable with respect to such whole shares of Media Stock and Series
D Preferred Stock and not paid, less the amount of any withholding taxes which
may be required thereon, and (ii) at the appropriate payment date, the amount of
dividends or other distributions with a record date after the Effective Time but
prior to surrender and a payment date subsequent to surrender payable with
respect to such whole shares of Media Stock and Series D Preferred Stock, less
the amount of any withholding taxes which may be required thereon.

            (b)  At or after the Effective Time, there shall be no transfers on
the stock transfer books of the Company of the shares of Company Common Stock
which were outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time.  If, after the
Effective Time, certificates representing any such shares are presented to the
Surviving Corporation, they shall be cancelled and exchanged for certificates
for the consideration, if any, deliverable in respect thereof pursuant to this
Agreement in accordance with the procedures set forth in this Article III.
Company Certificates surrendered for exchange by any Person constituting an
"affiliate" of the Company for purposes of Rule 145(c) under the Securities Act
shall not be exchanged until Acquiror has received a written agreement from such
Person as provided in Section 7.13.

            (c)  (i)  No certificates or scrip evidencing fractional shares of
Media Stock or Series D Preferred Stock


                                        25 

<PAGE>

shall be issued upon the surrender for exchange of Company Certificates, and
such fractional share interests will not entitle the owner thereof to vote or to
any rights of a stockholder of Acquiror.  In lieu of any such fractional shares,
the Exchange Agent shall, on behalf of all holders of fractional shares of Media
Stock and Series D Preferred Stock, as soon as practicable after the Effective
Time, aggregate all such fractional interests (collectively, the "Fractional
Shares") and, at Acquiror's option, such Fractional Shares shall be purchased by
Acquiror or otherwise sold by the Exchange Agent as agent for the holders of
such Fractional Shares, in either case at the then prevailing price on the NYSE,
all in the manner provided hereinafter.  Until the net proceeds of such sale or
sales have been distributed to the holders of Fractional Shares, the Exchange
Agent shall retain such proceeds in trust for the benefit of such holders.
Acquiror shall pay all commissions, transfer taxes and other out-of-pocket
transaction costs, including expenses and compensation of the Exchange Agent,
incurred in connection with such sale of the Fractional Shares.

            (ii)  To the extent not purchased by Acquiror, the sale of the
Fractional Shares by the Exchange Agent shall be executed on the NYSE or through
one or more member firms of the NYSE and will be executed in round lots to the
extent practicable.  In either case, the Exchange Agent will determine the
portion, if any, of the net proceeds of such sale to which each holder of
Fractional Shares is entitled, by multiplying the amount of the aggregate net
proceeds of the sale of the Fractional Shares, by a fraction, the numerator of
which is the amount of Fractional Shares to which such holder is entitled and
the denominator of which is the aggregate amount of Fractional Shares to which
all holders of Fractional Shares are entitled.

            (iii)  As soon as practicable after the determination of the amount
of cash, if any, to be paid to holders of Fractional Shares in lieu of such
Fractional Shares, the Exchange Agent shall mail such amounts, without interest,
to such holders; PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that no such amount will be paid to any
holder of such Fractional Shares prior to the surrender by such holder of the
Company Certificates formerly representing such holder's shares of Company
Common Stock.

            (d)   Any portion of the Exchange Fund that remains undistributed to
the holders of Company Common Stock for six


                                        26 

<PAGE>

months after the Effective Time shall be delivered to Acquiror, upon demand, and
any holders of Company Common Stock who have not theretofore complied with this
Article III shall thereafter look only to Acquiror for the Class A Merger
Consideration or Class B Merger Consideration, as applicable, net cash proceeds
from the sale of Fractional Shares and unpaid dividends and distributions on the
Media Stock and Series D Preferred Stock to which they are entitled.  All
interest accrued in respect of the Exchange Fund shall inure to the benefit of
and be paid to Acquiror.

            (e)   None of Acquiror, the Company or the Exchange Agent shall be
liable to any holder of shares of Company Common Stock for any cash, shares of
Media Stock or Series D Preferred Stock, net cash proceeds from the sale of
Fractional Shares or unpaid dividends or distributions with respect to Media
Stock or Series D Preferred Stock from the Exchange Fund delivered to a public
official pursuant to any applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar law.
If any Company Certificates shall not have been surrendered prior to seven years
after the Effective Time (or immediately prior to such earlier date on which any
cash, shares of Media Stock or Series D Preferred Stock, net cash proceeds from
the sale of Fractional Shares or unpaid dividends or distributions with respect
to Media Stock or Series D Preferred Stock in respect of such Company
Certificates would otherwise escheat to or become the property of any
Governmental Authority), any such cash, shares or unpaid dividends or
distributions in respect of such Company Certificates shall, to the extent
permitted by Applicable Laws, become the property of the Surviving Corporation;
PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that any holder of Company Common Stock shall thereafter
have the right to demand from Acquiror any such cash, shares or unpaid dividends
or distributions.

            (f)  In the event that any Company Certificate shall have been lost,
stolen or destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the Person
claiming such Company Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed and, if
required by Acquiror, the posting by such Person of a bond in such reasonable
amount as Acquiror may direct as indemnity against any claim that may be made
against it with respect to such Company Certificate, the Exchange Agent (or
Acquiror, as the case may be) will issue in exchange for such lost, stolen or
destroyed Company Certificate the Class A Merger Consideration or Class B Merger
Consideration, as applicable, cash in lieu of fractional


                                        27 

<PAGE>

shares, and unpaid dividends and distributions on shares of Media Stock and
Series D Preferred Stock deliverable in respect thereof pursuant to this
Agreement.

            (g)   Acquiror shall be entitled to, or shall be entitled to cause
the Exchange Agent to, deduct and withhold from the consideration otherwise
payable pursuant to this Agreement to any holder of shares of Company Common
Stock such amounts as are required to be deducted and withheld with respect to
the making of such payment under the Code, or any provision of state, local or
foreign tax law.  To the extent that amounts are so withheld by Acquiror or the
Exchange Agent, as the case may be, such withheld amounts shall be treated for
all purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the holder of the shares
of Company Common Stock in respect of which such deduction and withholding was
made by Acquiror.

            3.5   RESTRICTED STOCK.  To the extent any Company Common Stock
that is unvested and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time is
subject to the terms and conditions of a Restricted Stock Purchase Agreement
("RSPA") between the Company and any current or former employee of the Company
("Restricted Company Common Stock"), (i) the holder of such Restricted Company
Common Stock shall not be entitled to make a Cash Election in respect of such
Restricted Company Common Stock nor shall it receive cash pursuant to Section
3.3 and (ii) any Media Stock or Series D Preferred Stock received with respect
to such Restricted Company Common Stock shall be subject to the terms of such
RSPA, as amended by an Amendment to Restricted Stock Purchase Agreement
substantially in the form set forth in Section 3.5 of the Company Disclosure
Letter.

            3.6   DISSENTING SHARES.  Notwithstanding any other provisions of
this Agreement to the contrary, shares of Company Common Stock that are
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time and that are held by
stockholders who shall have not voted in favor of the Merger or consented
thereto in writing and who shall have demanded properly in writing appraisal for
such shares in accordance with Section 262 of the DGCL (collectively, the
"Dissenting Shares") shall not be converted into or represent the right to
receive the Class A Merger Consideration or Class B Merger Consideration, as
applicable.  Such stockholders shall be entitled to receive payment of the
appraised value of such shares of Company Common Stock held by them in
accordance with the provisions of such Section 262, except that all


                                        28 

<PAGE>

Dissenting Shares held by stockholders who shall have failed to perfect or who
effectively shall have withdrawn or lost their rights to appraisal of such
shares of Company Common Stock under such Section 262 shall thereupon be deemed
to have been converted into and to have become exchangeable, as of the Effective
Time, for the right to receive, without any interest thereon, the Class A Merger
Consideration or Class B Merger Consideration, as applicable, upon surrender in
the manner provided in this Article III, of the Company Certificate or Company
Certificates that formerly evidenced such shares of Class B Common Stock.

            3.7  SHARE PRICE ADJUSTMENT.  If the Closing shall not have
occurred on or prior to January 3, 1997, the Share Price shall be increased at a
rate equal to 8% per annum from and including January 1, 1997 to and excluding
the Closing Date calculated on the basis of the actual number of days in the
period (such amount being the "Additional Amount"); PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that
no such amount shall be added to the Share Price if (i) the Closing has not
occurred on or prior to January 3, 1997 and the last of the conditions set forth
in Article VIII to be fulfilled is the condition set forth in Section 8.2(h) or
the condition set forth in Section 8.1(a), other than, in each case as a result
of any action taken or not taken by Acquiror or (ii) the Company has taken any
action that would result in any of the conditions to the consummation of the
Merger set forth herein not being satisfied at such time; PROVIDED, FURTHER,
that upon satisfaction of the conditions described in clause (i) above if either
such condition is the last condition to be fulfilled, the Additional Amount
shall be added to the Share Price and shall be calculated commencing five
Business Days after the date of such satisfaction.

systems", as defined in Section 602(7) of the Cable Act, owned and operated by
the Company and its Subsidiaries in the United States.  The Franchises and any
related regulatory ordinances contain all material commitments, obligations and
rights of the Company and its Subsidiaries with respect to each of the
Governmental Authorities granting such Franchises, in connection with the
construction, ownership and operation of the Systems.  The Franchises enable the
Company and its Subsidiaries to operate, and, subject to obtaining the Franchise
Consents and License Consents, immediately following the Closing will enable the
Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries to continue to operate all of the
Systems as and where they are presently operated.  To the Knowledge of the
Company, each


                                        43 

<PAGE>

Franchise is valid under all Federal, state and local laws and is validly held
by the Company or its Subsidiaries, as the case may be.  The Company and its
Subsidiaries have complied with the material terms and conditions of the
Franchises and the same will not be subject to revocation or nonrenewal as a
result of the execution and delivery of this Agreement or the Transaction
Documents, or the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby and
thereby, subject to obtaining the Franchise Consents and License Consents.
Except as set forth in Section 4.12 of the Company Disclosure Letter, there are
no lawsuits, revocation proceedings or disputes pending with respect to any of
the Franchises or Systems that would material affect the right of the Company or
any Subsidiary to operate a System, and no Governmental Authority or other
Person has notified the Company or any of its Subsidiaries in writing of its
intention to conduct or initiate the same.  Neither the Company nor any of its
Subsidiaries has received any written notice that any such Franchise is under
consideration to be revoked nor, except for Franchises that are subject to
renewal negotiations, to be modified in any material respect.

            (b)  Except as set forth in Section 4.12 of the Company Disclosure
Letter, no Person other than certain municipalities (a list of which will be

to acquire any interest in any of the Systems, or to designate any other person
or entity to acquire any interest in any of the Systems (including, without
limitation, any right of first refusal or similar right to purchase any interest
in the Systems), which right has not been validly, properly and irrevocably

pursuant to Article IX hereof) waived by the party entitled to assert such
right.

            (c)  Section 4.12 of the Company Disclosure Letter lists the date on
which each Franchise will expire or has expired.  Except as set forth in Section
4.12 of the Company Disclosure Letter, there are not now pending any proceedings
of any Governmental Authority with respect to any proposal for renewal of any
Franchise.  There exists no fact or circumstance that makes it likely that any
Franchise will not be renewed or extended on commercially reasonable terms.
Except where the Company or its Subsidiaries are proceeding under informal
renewal procedures as provided for by the Cable Act, the Company and its
Subsidiaries have timely


                                        44 

<PAGE>

filed with the appropriate Governmental Authority all appropriate requests for
renewal within 30 to 36 months under the Cable Act.  Section 4.12 of the Company
Disclosure Letter sets forth those Franchises serving 25,000 or more Subscribers
("Material Franchises") where the Company or a Subsidiary has not filed a
written renewal notice pursuant to Section 626(a)(1) of the Cable Act. Except
as set forth in Section 4.12 of the Company Disclosure Letter, as to any
Franchise that has expired prior to the date hereof, the Company is currently
operating such Franchise under duly authorized extensions, and the Company has
no reason to believe that such extensions will not be renewed until such time
as the Franchise itself has been renewed for an additional term.

businesses of the Company and its Subsidiaries are, and have been, operated in

regulations of the FCC or other Governmental Authorities with jurisdiction.
Except as set forth in Section 4.12 of the Company Disclosure Letter, the
operation of the Systems has been, and is, in compliance with the rules and
regulations of the FCC or other Governmental Authorities with jurisdiction and
the Company and its Subsidiaries have not received any written notice from the
FCC or other Governmental Authorities with jurisdiction with respect to any
material violation of its rules and regulations or from any other Governmental
Authorities with jurisdiction with respect to any material violation of any
Franchise.

            (e)  To the Company's Knowledge, for each relevant semi-annual
reporting period, the Company has timely filed with the United States Copyright
Office all required Statements of Account in true and correct form in all
material respects, and has paid when due all required copyright royalty fee
payments in the correct amount, relating to the Systems' carriage of television
broadcast signals and appropriately classifying the applicable tiers on which
the Systems carry television broadcast signals.  To the Company's Knowledge,
carriage of all broadcast signals is in compliance with the Copyright Act of
1976, as amended (the "Copyright Act") and the rules and regulations of the
Copyright Office and is eligible for the compulsory license under Section 111 of
the Copyright Act.  Except as set forth


                                        45

in Section 4.12 of the Company Disclosure Letter, neither the Company nor any of
its Subsidiaries has received any inquiry from the Copyright Office or any Third
Party challenging or questioning the information submitted in any Statement of
Account or the amount of any royalty payment, for which the Company has not
provided adequate reserves in its reasonable business judgment, nor are the
Company or its Subsidiaries aware of any basis for such inquiry.  Except as set
forth in Section 4.12 of the Company Disclosure Letter, to the Company's
Knowledge, no claim or copyright infringement has been made against the Company
or any of its Subsidiaries that has not been settled, nor is any such claim
pending or threatened.

Disclosure Letter, neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries is subject to
any FCC proceeding challenging the rights of the Company or its Subsidiaries to
carry or not carry any signal, nor has the Company or any of its Subsidiaries
received any written notice or demand to carry or not carry any signal, the
carriage or non-carriage of which could have a material adverse effect on any
System.

            (g)  The Systems (other than the Recently Acquired Systems) are, and
have been, operated in material compliance with the Social Contract Order and
the Company and its Subsidiaries have submitted to the FCC and any relevant
Governmental Authority all forms, notices and other written material required
thereunder for implementation of the Social Contract.  Each such filing has been
prepared and filed in compliance with the Social Contract Order and is complete
and accurate in all material respects.  Neither the Company nor any Subsidiary
has received written notice from the FCC as to any non-compliance with the
Social Contract Order.  The Company shall use its reasonable best efforts to
seek amendment of the Social Contract Order to bring the Recently Acquired
Systems under terms substantially the same as those contained in the proposed
Social Contract Amendment.

            (h)  Section 4.12 of the Company Disclosure Letter lists each of 
the Governmental Authorities that (i) has been certified by the FCC pursuant 
to 47 C.F.R Section 76.910 to regulate Basic Cable Service and associated 
equipment of a System or  (ii) has petitioned the FCC to regulate the rates 
for Basic Cable Basic Cable Service and associated equipment pursuant to 47 
C.F.R Section 76.913; Section 4.12 of the Company Disclosure Letter also

Social Contract Order.  Of those listed, the Form 329 complaints pertaining to
the Recently Acquired Systems would be settled by the proposed Social Contract
Amendment.

            (i)  To the extent that the Company's and/or its Subsidiaries' rates
have not been settled pursuant to the Social Contract or would not be settled by
the proposed Social Contract Amendment, the Company and/or its Subsidiaries are
in compliance in all material respects with FCC rate requirements.

            (j)   Except as set forth in Section 4.12 of the Company Disclosure
Letter, neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries (x) is under any
investigation by the FCC or any Governmental Authority with respect to any of
its rates for Basic Cable Service or any Cable Programming Service (including
but not limited to rates for associated equipment) or (y) is a party to any
proceeding before the FCC or any other Governmental Authority the collective
outcome of which could result in the Company or any of its Subsidiaries being
ordered to make refunds to Subscribers in excess of $2,000,000 (exclusive of
potential Social Contract Amendment refunds) or reduce the rates currently
charged to Subscribers when netted against any increases to which the Company is
entitled.

            (k)   Section 4.12 of the Company Disclosure Letter lists each
System, and the Franchise(s) by which it is authorized, that is subject to

connection with any such action.

            (b)   None of the information supplied or to be supplied by the
Company, on the one hand, or Acquiror, on the other hand, for inclusion or
incorporation by reference in (i) the Form S-4 will, at the time the Form S-4 is
filed with the SEC, at any time it is amended or supplemented or at the time it
becomes effective under the Securities Act, contain any untrue statement of a
material fact or omit to state any material fact required to be stated therein

Act, as the case may be.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, (i) no representation
is made by the Company with respect to statements made or incorporated by
reference therein based on information supplied in writing by Acquiror
specifically for inclusion or incorporation by reference in the Proxy Statement
and (ii) no representation is made by Acquiror with respect to statements made
or incorporated by reference therein based on information supplied in writing by
the Company specifically for inclusion or incorporation by reference in the Form

            (c)   The Company and Acquiror shall cooperate with each other and
provide to each other all information necessary in order to prepare the Proxy

occur (i) any event with respect to the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, or
with respect to other information supplied by the Company for inclusion in the
Proxy Statement or (ii) any event with respect to Acquiror, or with respect to
information supplied by Acquiror for inclusion in the Form S-4, in either case
which event is required to be described in an amendment of, or a supplement to,
the Proxy Statement or Form S-4, such event shall be so described, and such
amendment or supplement shall be promptly filed with the SEC and, as required by
law, disseminated to the stockholders of the Company.  Acquiror shall notify the
Company promptly upon (i) the declaration by the SEC of the effectiveness of the
Form S-4, (ii) the issuance or threatened issuance of any stop order or other
order preventing or suspending the use of any prospectus relating to the Form

threatened to be commenced by the SEC or any state securities commission that
might result in the issuance of a stop order or other order or suspension of use
or (v) any request by the SEC to supplement or amend any prospectus relating to
the Form S-4 after the effectiveness thereof.  Acquiror and, to the extent
applicable, the Company, shall use its reasonable best efforts to prevent or
promptly remove any stop order or other order preventing or suspending the use
of any prospectus relating to the Form S-4 and to comply with any such request
by the SEC or any state securities commission to amend or supplement the Form
S-4 or the prospectus relating thereto.

            (d)   The Company shall, as promptly as practicable, duly call, give
notice of, convene and hold a meeting of its stockholders (the "Initial

The


                                        68 

<PAGE>

Company shall use its reasonable best efforts to hold such meeting as soon as
practicable.  In the event the Charter Amendment is not approved at the Initial
Stockholders' Meeting, the Company shall, as promptly as practicable following
the date of the Initial Stockholders' Meeting, duly call, give notice of,
convene and hold another meeting of its stockholders (the "Additional
Stockholders' Meeting" and, together with the Initial Stockholders' Meeting,
collectively, the "Stockholders' Meetings" and individually, a "Stockholders'
Meeting") for the purpose of obtaining the Stockholder Approvals.  The Company
shall, as promptly as practicable after the date of the Initial Stockholders'
Meeting, hold the Additional Stockholders' Meeting.  Subject to the fiduciary
duties of the Board of Directors of the Company under Applicable Laws and to
Section 9.1(g), the Company shall, through the Board of Directors, recommend to
its stockholders adoption of this Agreement, the Charter Amendment and the other
transactions contemplated hereby and shall use its best efforts to solicit from
stockholders proxies in favor of adoption of this Agreement and the Charter
Amendment and to take all other action necessary to secure the Stockholder
Approvals at the Initial Stockholders' Meeting or the Additional Stockholders'
Meeting, as the case may be.  Without limiting the generality of the foregoing,
the Company agrees that its obligations pursuant to the first and third
sentences of this Section 7.1(d) shall not be altered by the commencement,
public proposal or communication to the Company of any Acquisition Proposal (as
defined in Section 7.10).

            (e)   Subject to receipt of the Stockholder Approvals, the Company
shall take all actions necessary to cause the Charter Amendment to be executed,
acknowledged and filed and to become effective no later than immediately prior
to the Effective Time in accordance with the DGCL as soon as practicable after

its reasonable best efforts to cause to be delivered to Acquiror letters of (i)
Deloitte & Touche LLP, the Company's independent public accountants and (ii) any
other independent public accountants whose reports are


                                        69 

<PAGE>

included or incorporated by reference in the Form S-4, each dated a date within
two business days before the date on which the Form S-4 shall become effective
and addressed to Acquiror, in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to
Acquiror and customary in scope and substance for letters delivered by
independent public accountants in connection with registration statements
similar to the Form S-4.

            7.3   LETTER OF ACQUIROR'S ACCOUNTANTS.  Acquiror shall use its
reasonable best efforts to cause to be delivered to the Company a letter of
Coopers & Lybrand L.L.P., Acquiror's independent public accountants, dated a

satisfactory to the Company and customary in scope and substance for letters
delivered by independent public accountants in connection with registration
statements similar to the Form S-4.

            7.4   REASONABLE BEST EFFORTS.  Subject to the terms and
conditions of this Agreement, including, without limitation, Section 7.6, each
of the parties hereto agrees to use its reasonable best efforts to take, or
cause to be taken, all action and to do, or cause to be done, all things
necessary, proper or advisable under Applicable Laws and regulations to
consummate and make effective the transactions contemplated by this Agreement
(including the execution of the Transaction Documents to which they or any of
their Affiliates are a party), subject to the Stockholder Approval, including
(a) the obtaining of all necessary actions or nonactions, waivers, consents and
approvals from Governmental Authorities and the making of it all necessary
registrations and filings (including filings with Governmental Authorities, if
any), and the taking of all reasonable steps as may be necessary to obtain an
approval or waiver from, or to avoid an action or proceeding by, any
Governmental Authorities, (b) the obtaining of all necessary consents, approvals
or waivers from Third Parties and (c) the execution and delivery of any
additional instruments necessary to consummate the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement and the Transaction Documents.  In furtherance of the foregoing,
Acquiror and the Company each shall furnish to the other such necessary
information and reasonable assistance as the other may request in connection
with obtaining any consents required to be obtained by it hereunder.


                                        70 

<PAGE>

            7.5   FRANCHISE AND LICENSE CONSENTS.  (a)  Without limiting the
generality of Section 7.4, the Company and Acquiror shall each use their
respective reasonable best efforts to obtain all Franchise Consents and License
Consents, including taking the actions specified herein.  In order to secure the
Franchise Consents and License Consents from Governmental Authorities and the
FCC, the Company shall proceed immediately in good faith and using its
reasonable best efforts, to prepare, file and prosecute each Franchise Consent
and License Consent from the relevant Governmental Authority and the FCC, with
the full right of participation by Acquiror including, without limitation, the
right of prior review and approval of correspondence or forms of transfer
resolutions, applications, ordinances or agreements to be submitted to
Governmental Authorities and the FCC (which approval shall not be unreasonably
withheld or delayed) and to be represented at all meetings or hearings as may be
scheduled to consider such submissions.  The Company shall send notice of the
transactions contemplated in this Agreement to all Governmental Authorities.
The Company shall submit to each Governmental Authority whose consent is
required a form of ordinance or resolution, as appropriate, relating to the
transfer of the Franchise, which ordinance or resolution shall be in a form
reasonably acceptable to Acquiror and the Company.  The Company shall consult
with Acquiror and promptly and regularly notify Acquiror with regard to all
material developments of the Franchise Consent and License Consent process, and
shall give Acquiror reasonable prior notice of all meetings scheduled with the
Governmental Authorities and the FCC.  Acquiror shall use its reasonable best
efforts to promptly assist the Company and shall take such prompt and
affirmative actions as may reasonably be necessary in obtaining such approvals
and shall cooperate with the Company in the preparation, filing and prosecution
of such applications as may reasonably be necessary, including the preparation,
filing and prosecution of any joint applications required to be filed with the
Governmental Authorities or the FCC, and agrees to use its reasonable best
efforts to furnish all information as is reasonably or as is customarily
required by the approving entity, and, if required by a Governmental Authority
or the FCC upon reasonable notice, Acquiror shall have the obligation to be
represented at such meetings or hearings as may be scheduled to consider such
applications.  Any administrative filing fees imposed or expenses for which
reimbursement is required by the Governmental Authority in connection with
obtaining the Franchise Consents or the License Consents shall be


                                        71 

<PAGE>

borne by the Company and each of the parties shall bear its own legal fees or
other costs of professional advisors incurred in the filing and prosection of
such applications.  If, in connection with obtaining Franchise Consents or the
License Consents from a Governmental Authority or the FCC, a Governmental
Authority or the FCC impose new, material Franchise or license conditions as a
condition to granting its consent, Acquiror and the Company shall negotiate
jointly with such Governmental Authority or the FCC with respect to such
conditions, with such conditions to be accepted only if consented to by Acquiror
and the Company, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld.  Acquiror
agrees that prior to the Closing Date, it will not, without the prior written
consent of the Company, seek amendments, modifications or other changes to
Franchises and shall not institute any discussions with Governmental Authorities
or the FCC without the prior written consent of the Company and without offering
a representative of the Company an opportunity to participate or observe such
discussions.  To the extent such request would not, in the reasonable judgment
of the Company, delay or impair the ability to obtain any Franchise Consents,
any application to any Governmental Authority for any Franchise Consent
necessary for the transfer of control of any Franchise shall request that the
relevant Governmental Authority also agree that no further Franchise Consent
shall be required for the subsequent transfer of control of, or assignment of,
such Franchise to a specified Person identified in such application who is an
Affiliate of Acquiror to which Acquiror intends to transfer or assign the
Franchise immediately prior to Closing.  In addition, the Company will use
reasonable best efforts to obtain necessary transfers of all private mobile
radio service licenses.

            (b)   To the extent that any Franchise Consents listed in Section
4.6 of the Company Disclosure Letter have not been obtained by Final Order prior
to Closing (such Franchises hereinafter referred to as the "Non-Required
Franchises"), Acquiror and Company shall enter into negotiations to determine
the disposition of the Non-Required Franchises after Closing.  In the event that
the parties agree to transfer any part of a System which includes, in part,
areas covered by a Non-Required Franchise (hereinafter the "Non-Required
Systems"), the parties shall continue to be subject to Section 7.5(a) until such
time as all Franchise Consents are obtained and the Non-Required Franchises are
transferred to Acquiror.

the DOJ the notification and report form required for the transactions
contemplated hereby and any supplemental information requested in connection
therewith pursuant to the HSR Act.  Each of Acquiror and the Company shall
furnish to each other's counsel such necessary information and reasonable
assistance as the other may request in connection with its preparation of any
filing or submission that is necessary under the HSR Act.  The Company and
Acquiror acknowledge that more than one filing may be required under the HSR Act
in order to consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, and
agree to cooperate and furnish to each other's counsel such necessary
information and reasonable assistance as the other may request in connection
with its preparation of any subsequent filing.

            (b)   The Company and Acquiror shall keep each other apprised of the
status of any communications with, and any inquiries or requests for additional
information from, the FTC and the DOJ and shall comply promptly with any such
inquiry or request.

            (c)   Each of the Company and Acquiror shall use its reasonable best
efforts to obtain any clearance required under the HSR Act for the consummation
of the Merger, which efforts, for purposes of this Agreement shall not, except
as provided in Section 7.6(d), require Acquiror in order to obtain any consent
or clearance from the DOJ or any other Governmental Authority to (i) hold
separate, sell or otherwise dispose of any assets, including assets of the
Company, the effect of any of which, in the reasonable judgment of Acquiror,
would be to materially impair the value of the Merger to Acquiror or (ii)
contest any suit brought or threatened by the FTC or DOJ or attempt to lift or
rescind any injunction or restraining order obtained by the FTC or DOJ adversely
affecting the ability of the parties hereto to consummate the transactions
contemplated hereby.

            (d)   For purposes of Section 7.6(c), "reasonable best efforts"
shall include entry into a consent decree in any action brought by the DOJ or
into a consent order with the FTC where such decree or order requires the
divestiture of the Designated Assets and of the assets set forth in Section
7.6(d) of the Company Disclosure Letter, if and only


                                        73 

<PAGE>

if, such decree or order does not require, either absolutely or conditionally,
the divestiture of any other assets or of the stock of any other corporation, or
(except for reasonable and customary compliance and other requirements ancillary
to the required divestiture) impose any additional requirement or limitation on
Acquiror, on its ability to operate its current and contemplated businesses, or
on its ability to acquire assets or stock in any corporation; and only if such
decree or order provides that Acquiror shall have a period of at least 12 months
to effect such divestiture itself and an additional 12 months to divest pursuant
to a reasonable and customary trusteeship provision.

            7.7   CERTAIN ACTIONS.  (a)  Except as otherwise specifically
limited by this Agreement, each of the Company and Acquiror agrees to use its
reasonable best efforts and to take, or cause to be taken, all actions and to
do, or cause to be done, all things necessary, proper or advisable to ensure
that there shall be no regulatory impediments, pursuant to the Communications
Act, the rules and regulations of the FCC, or otherwise, to the closing of the
transactions contemplated hereby and the Company agrees not to acquire any
assets or engage in any activities prior to the Closing of a type which Acquiror
would be precluded from acquiring or engaging in pursuant to the Communications
Act, the rules and regulations of the FCC or otherwise.

            (b)   On or prior to the Closing Date, the Company shall sell,
distribute to stockholders or otherwise dispose of the properties of the Company
and its Subsidiaries listed in Section 7.7 of the Company Disclosure Letter (the
"Designated Assets") in a manner acceptable to Acquiror, in its sole discretion.

            (c)   Not later than one hundred and twenty (120) days following the
date hereof, the Company and Acquiror shall agree to the fair market value of
the Designated Assets (the "Designated Asset Fair Market Value").  In the event
of a sale or other disposition of the Designated Assets for an amount less than
the Designated Asset Fair Market Value, the Share Price shall be reduced by the
quotient of (i) the excess of (x) the Designated Asset Fair Market Value over
(y) the amount of consideration received by the Company in respect of such sale
or disposition divided by (ii) the number of shares of Company Common Stock
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time on a fully diluted basis,
including giving effect to the


                                        74 

<PAGE>

conversion of all outstanding shares of Company Preferred Stock.  In the event
of a distribution of the Designated Assets to the stockholders of the Company,
the Share Price shall be reduced by an amount equal to the quotient of (i) the
Designated Asset Fair Market Value divided by (ii) the number of shares of
Company Common Stock outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time on a
fully diluted basis, including giving effect to the conversion of all
outstanding shares of Company Preferred Stock.  The amount of any adjustment to
the Share Price pursuant to this Section 7.7(c) shall be referred to as the "Per
Share Adjustment Amount" and the Cash Consideration Amount shall be reduced by
the Per Share Adjustment Amount multiplied by the number of shares of Company
Common Stock outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time on a fully
diluted basis, including giving effect to the conversion of all outstanding
shares of Company Preferred Stock.

            7.8   SUPPLEMENTAL DISCLOSURE.  The Company shall confer on a
regular and frequent basis with Acquiror, report on operational matters and
promptly notify Acquiror of, and furnish Acquiror with, any information it may
reasonably request with respect to, any event or condition or the existence of
any fact that would cause any of the conditions to Acquiror's obligation to
consummate the Merger not to be completed, and Acquiror shall promptly notify
the Company of, and furnish the Company any information it may reasonably
request with respect to, any event or condition or the existence of any fact
that would cause any of the conditions to the Company's obligation to consummate
the Merger not to be completed.

            7.9   ANNOUNCEMENTS.  Prior to the Closing, neither the Company
nor Acquiror will issue any press release or otherwise make any public statement
with respect to this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby without
the prior consent of the other (which consent shall not be unreasonably
withheld), except as may be required by Applicable Law or stock exchange
regulations (including, without limitation, pursuant to the United States
Federal securities laws in connection with any registration statement or report
filed thereunder), in which event the party required to make the release or
announcement shall, if possible, allow the other party reasonable time to
comment on such release or announcement in advance of such issuance.

            7.10  NO SOLICITATION.  (a)  From the date hereof until the
Effective Time, the Company shall not, nor shall it permit any of its
Subsidiaries to, nor shall it authorize or permit any of its officers,
directors, employees, agents, investment bankers, attorneys, financial advisors
or other representatives or those of any of its Subsidiaries (collectively,
"Company Representatives") to, directly or indirectly, solicit, initiate or
encourage (including by way of furnishing information or assistance) or take
other action to facilitate any inquiries or the making of any proposal that
constitutes or may reasonably be expected to lead to, an Acquisition Proposal
from any Third Party, or engage in any discussions or negotiations relating
thereto or in furtherance thereof or accept or enter any agreement with respect
to any Acquisition Proposal; PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that, notwithstanding
anything to the contrary in this Agreement, (i) prior to the approval of this
Agreement by the Stockholders of the Company, the Company may engage in
discussions or negotiations with, and may furnish information concerning the
Company and its business, properties and assets to, a Third Party who, without
any solicitation, initiation, encouragement, discussion or negotiation, directly
or indirectly, by or with the Company or any Company Representatives, or in
furtherance thereof makes a written, bona fide Acquisition Proposal that is not
subject to any material contingencies relating to financing and that is
reasonably capable of being financed and is financially superior to the
consideration to be received by the Company's stockholders pursuant to the
Merger (as determined in good faith by the Board of Directors after consultation
with the Company's financial advisors) if (1) the Board of Directors determines
in its good faith, after receipt of written advice of the Company's outside
legal counsel, that such action is advisable for the Board of Directors to act
in a manner consistent with its fiduciary duties under Applicable Law and (2)
prior to furnishing information with respect to the Company and its Subsidiaries
to, such Third Party, the Company shall receive from such Third Party an
executed confidentiality agreement in reasonably customary form on terms not
more favorable to such Person or entity than the terms contained in the
Confidentiality Agreements, or (ii) the Board of Directors may take and disclose
to the Company's stockholders a position with regard to a tender offer or
exchange offer to the extent required by Rule 14e-2(a) under the Exchange Act.
Without limiting the foregoing, it is understood that any violation of the
restrictions set forth in the preceding sentence by any investment banker or
financial advisor


                                        76 

<PAGE>

retained by the Company, whether or not such Person is purporting to act of
behalf of the Company of any of its Subsidiaries or otherwise, shall constitute
a breach of this Section 7.10 by the Company.

            (b)   The Company shall promptly notify Acquiror orally and in
writing of any Acquisition Proposal or any inquiry with respect to or which
could lead to any Acquisition Proposal, within 24 hours of the receipt thereof,
including the identity of the Third Party making any such Acquisition Proposal
or inquiry and the material terms and conditions of any Acquisition Proposal,
and if such Acquisition Proposal or inquiry is in writing, shall deliver to
Acquiror a copy of such Acquisition Proposal or inquiry.  The Company shall keep
Acquiror informed of the status and details of any such Acquisition Proposal or
inquiry.

            (c)   The Company shall immediately cease and cause to be terminated
any existing solicitation, initiation, encouragement, activity, discussion or
negotiation with any parties conducted heretofore by the Company or any Company
Representatives with respect to any of the foregoing.

            (d)   As used in this Agreement, "Acquisition Proposal" shall mean
any proposal or offer, other than a proposal or offer by Acquiror or any of its
Affiliates, for a tender or exchange offer, merger, consolidation or other
business combination involving the Company or any of its material Subsidiaries
or any proposal to acquire in any manner a substantial equity interest in or a
substantial portion of the assets of the Company or any of its material
Subsidiaries; PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that, the term "Acquisition Proposal" shall
not include any acquisition by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries of any
assets, businesses or entities in any transaction or series of related
transactions in exchange for other assets, businesses or entities of any Third
Party.

            7.11  INDEMNIFICATION; DIRECTORS' AND OFFICERS INSURANCE.  (a)
The Restated Certificate of Incorporation and Bylaws of the Surviving
Corporation at the Effective Time shall not be amended, repealed or otherwise
modified for a period of six years after the Effective Time in any manner that
would adversely affect the rights thereunder of individuals who at any time
prior to the Effective Time were directors or officers of the Company or its
Subsidiaries in respect of actions or omissions occurring at or prior to the


                                        77 

<PAGE>

Effective Time (including, without limitation, the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement), unless such modification is required by law.

            (b)   From and after the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation
shall, indemnify, defend and hold harmless each Person who is now, or has been
at any time prior to the date hereof or who becomes prior to the Effective Time,
an officer or director of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries (the
"Indemnified Parties") against all losses, claims, damages, costs, expenses
(including attorneys' fees and expenses), liabilities or judgments or amounts
that are paid in settlement with the approval of the indemnifying party (which
approval shall not be unreasonably withheld) of or in connection with any
threatened or actual claim, action, suit, proceeding or investigation based in
whole or in part on or arising in whole or in part out of the fact that such
Person is or was a director or officer of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries
or served as a director of any Third Party on behalf of the Company or any of
its Subsidiaries whether pertaining to any matter existing or occurring at or
prior to the Effective Time and whether asserted or claimed prior to, or at or
after, the Effective Time ("Indemnified Liabilities"), including, without
limitation, all Indemnified Liabilities based in whole or in part on, or arising
in whole or in part out of, or pertaining to this Agreement or the transactions
contemplated hereby, in each case to the fullest extent a corporation is
permitted under the DGCL to indemnify its own directors or officers as the case
may be (and the Company or the Surviving Corporation, as the case may be, will
pay expenses in advance of the final disposition of any such action or
proceeding to each Indemnified Party to the full extent permitted by law).

            (c)   The provisions of this Section 7.11 are intended to be for the
benefit of, and shall be enforceable by, each Indemnified Party, his or her
heirs and his or her personal representatives and shall be binding on all
successors and assigns of Acquiror and the Company.

            7.12  NYSE LISTING.  Acquiror shall use its best efforts to cause
the shares of Media Stock and Series D Preferred Stock to be issued in the
Merger to be approved for listing on the NYSE, subject only to notice of
official issuance, prior to the Effective Time.  If, for any reason, Acquiror
shall not be able to list the shares of the Series D Preferred Stock to be
issued in the Merger on the NYSE,


                                        78 

<PAGE>

Acquiror shall use its best efforts to, prior to the Effective Date, list such
shares on such other stock exchange, or cause such shares to be eligible for
trading on such other trading facility, as the Company may request.

            7.13  AFFILIATES.  Prior to the Closing Date, the Company shall
deliver to Acquiror a letter identifying all Persons who are, at the time this
Agreement is submitted to the stockholders of the Company, "affiliates" of the
Company for purposes of Rule 145 under the Securities Act.  The Company shall
use its best efforts to cause each such Person to deliver to Acquiror on or
prior to the Closing Date a written agreement substantially in the form attached
as Exhibit D.

            7.14  EMPLOYEE BENEFITS.  (a)  For a period of one year following
the Effective Time, Acquiror shall maintain in effect for employees of the
Company and its Subsidiaries benefits (other than RSPAs or similar benefits) no
less favorable in the aggregate than the benefits offered by the Company
immediately prior to the Effective Time.  Acquiror agrees to honor and perform
all severance, employment and similar agreements of the Company disclosed in
Section 4.11 of the Company Disclosure Letter and each RSPA and related Tax
Liability Financing Agreement.

            (b)  Following the date hereof, the Company shall, after
consultation with Acquiror, be permitted to (i) forgive up to $35.7 million
principal amount of outstanding loans made by the Company to employees to enable
such employees to pay income Taxes incurred by such employees as a result of the
purchase of shares of Company Common Stock by such employees pursuant to the
RSPAs in accordance with the terms of an amendment to the Tax Liability
Financing Agreement substantially in the form set forth in Section 7.14 of the
Company Disclosure Letter; PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that any loan to an employee
of the Company who is, or reasonably can be expected to become, a "covered
employee" (within the meaning of Section 162(m) of the Code) shall in no event
be forgiven, in whole or in part, prior to the day following the Closing Date,
(ii) issue up to 350,000 shares of Company Common Stock pursuant to RSPAs
substantially in the form heretofore provided to Acquiror to employees of the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries; and PROVIDED, FURTHER, that, in each
case, such forgiveness or issuance acts as incentive for the purpose of
retaining and motivating such employee to continue in the employment of the
Company following the


                                        79 

<PAGE>

Effective Time and is implemented in a manner consistent with such purpose.

            (c)   If, following the Effective Time, the termination of the
employee's employment with the Company or any of its Subsidiaries results in the
acceleration of the vesting of an award under any RSPA or the forgiveness of a
loan related to an RSPA pursuant to a Tax Liability Financing Agreement (other
than as a result of termination of employment by reason of the employee's death
or disability) (an "Acceleration Event") and as a result of such Acceleration
Event, the employee either (i) becomes subject to an excise tax (the "Excise
Tax") under Section 4999 of the Code that such employee would not have been
subject to without the occurrence of such Acceleration Event or (ii) the amount
of the Excise Tax imposed on such employee is greater than the amount of the
Excise Tax that would have been imposed without the occurrence of such
Acceleration Event (the "Incremental Excise Tax"), Acquiror shall pay or shall
cause to be paid to the employee, at the time specified below, an additional
amount (the "Additional Payment") sufficient to (a) in the case of clause (i)
above, reimburse the employee for the Excise Tax and in the case of clause (ii)
above, reimburse the employee for the Incremental Excise Tax and (b) in either
case, reimburse the employee for any federal, state or local income tax or any
additional excise tax under Section 4999 of the Code payable with respect to any
Additional Payment made pursuant to this Section 7.14(c).  The Additional
Payment provided for in this Section 7.14(c) shall be made no later than the due
date for the Excise Tax or Incremental Excise Tax (as the case may be) imposed.
In the event of any dispute in the calculations made pursuant to this Section
7.14(c), an independent big six accounting firm shall be selected to resolve any
such dispute and the decision of such accounting firm shall be final and binding
on the Company and the employee.  The fees and costs of such accounting firm
shall be shared equally among the Company and the employee.

            7.15  REGISTRATION RIGHTS AGREEMENT.  Acquiror shall execute and
deliver to the other parties thereto the Registration Rights Agreement at or
prior to the Closing.

            7.16  TAX TREATMENT.  (a)  Each of Acquiror and the Company shall
use its reasonable best efforts to cause the Merger to qualify as a
reorganization under the provisions of Sections 368(a) of the Code and to obtain
the opinions of counsel referred to in Sections 8.2(c) and 8.3(c).


                                        80 

<PAGE>

            (b)   The Company and Acquiror agree that if a ruling satisfactory
to the Company, Acquiror and The Providence Journal Company is obtained from the
IRS, this Agreement shall be amended to permit the creation of a newly-formed
holding company to acquire the capital stock of the Company and Acquiror.

            7.17  SERIES D PREFERRED STOCK.  Prior to the Effective Time,
Acquiror shall file with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware a
Certificate of Designation, in the form of Exhibit C hereto, with respect to the
shares of Series D Preferred Stock issuable pursuant to Section 3.1.

            7.18  COMPANY INDEBTEDNESS.  The Company shall assist Acquiror,
and shall take such actions as Acquiror may reasonably request at Acquiror's
sole expense in order to facilitate with respect to the amendment, repayment,
redemption, refinancing or other restructuring of outstanding Indebtedness of
the Company on or after the Effective Time in connection with the Merger.

            7.19  AUTHORIZATION OF ISSUANCE OF MERGER CONSIDERATION.  Acquiror
shall obtain any authorizations and consents necessary, and shall take such
further actions as may be required, for the issuance of the Media Stock and the
Series D Preferred Stock to holders of Company Common Stock pursuant to the
terms of this Agreement.

            7.20  ATTRIBUTION.  Following the Effective Time, the board of
directors of Acquiror shall attribute all of the assets and liabilities of the
Company and its Subsidiaries to the Media Group pursuant to Sections 2.5.1 and
2.6.15 of Article V of the Restated Certificate of Incorporation of Acquiror as
in effect as of the date hereof.

            7.21  FURTHER ASSURANCES.  Each of the parties hereto shall
execute such documents and other instruments and take such further actions as
may be reasonably required or desirable to carry out the provisions hereof and
consummate and evidence the transactions contemplated hereby or, at and after
the Closing Date, to evidence the consummation of the transactions contemplated
by this Agreement.  Upon the terms and subject to the conditions hereof, each of
the parties hereto shall take or cause to be taken all actions and to do or
cause to be done all other things necessary, proper or advisable to consummate

and approvals and to effect all necessary registrations and filings.

conditions, any or all of which may be waived in whole or in part by Acquiror:

            (a)   REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES.  There shall be no breach of
      any representation or warranty of the Company made hereunder that,
      individually or together with all other such breaches, results in a
      Material Adverse Effect with respect to the Company.  Acquiror shall have
      received a certificate from the Company dated the Closing Date signed by
      an authorized officer of the Company certifying to the fulfillment of this
      condition.

      of Acquiror and the Company should be a party to the reorganization within
      the meaning of Section 368(b) of the Code; and (iii) no gain or loss

      In rendering such opinion, Weil, Gotshal & Manges LLP may receive and rely
      upon representations contained in certificates of the


                                        83 

<PAGE>

      Company, Acquiror, and certain stockholders of the Company.

            (d)   LETTERS FROM AFFILIATES.  Acquiror shall have received from
      each Person in the letter referred to in Section 7.13 an executed copy of
      an agreement substantially in the form of Exhibit D.

            (e)   CONSENTS.  All Company Consents (other than Franchise
      Consents) and Acquiror Consents shall have been obtained, except where the
      failure to obtain any such consent would not have a Material Adverse
      Effect with respect to the Company or Acquiror, as the case may be.

            (f)   TRANSACTION DOCUMENTS.  Each of the Transaction Documents
      which were not executed on the date hereof shall have been duly authorized
      and executed by the parties thereto other than Acquiror.

      in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to it, that the number of
      Dissenting Shares shall constitute no greater than 10% of the total number
      of shares of Company Common Stock (assuming conversion of the Company
      Preferred Stock) outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time.

            (h)   OTHER ACTIONS.  The Company shall have disposed of the
      Designated Assets as provided in Section 7.7.

            (i)   LITIGATION.  Except as described in Section 7.6(c), there
      shall not be pending or threatened by any Governmental Authority any suit,
      action or proceeding, (i) seeking to restrain or prohibit the Merger or
      seeking to obtain from Acquiror or the Company or any of their respective
      Subsidiaries in connection with the Merger any material damages, (ii)
      seeking to prohibit or limit the ownership or operation by Acquiror, the
      Company or any of their respective Subsidiaries of any material portion of
      the business or assets of Acquiror and its Subsidiaries taken as a whole
      or the Company and its Subsidiaries taken as a whole, or to compel
      Acquiror, the Company or any of their respective Subsidiaries to dispose
      of or hold separate any material portion of the business or assets of
      Acquiror and its Subsidiaries taken as a whole or the Company


                                        84 

<PAGE>

      and its Subsidiaries taken as a whole, in each case as a result of the
      Merger or any of the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement or
      the Transaction Documents, (iii) seeking to impose limitations on the
      ability of Acquiror to acquire or hold, or exercise full rights of
      ownership of, the shares of Company Capital Stock, including the right to
      vote such shares of Company Capital Stock on all matters properly
      presented to the stockholders of the Company or (iv) seeking to prohibit
      Acquiror from effectively controlling in any material respect any portion
      of the business or operations of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries
      taken as a whole, which, in each case, has a reasonable likelihood of
      success and if determined in a manner adverse to the Company or Acquiror,

      Company.

            (d)   CONSENTS.  All Company Consents and Acquiror Consents shall
      have been obtained, except where the failure to obtain any such consent

      waived by Acquiror, or if the Company shall breach in any material respect
      any of its representations, warranties or obligations hereunder and such
      breach shall not have been cured in all material respects or waived and
      the Company shall not have provided reasonable assurance that such breach
      will be cured in all material respects on or before the Closing Date, but
      only if such breach, singly or together with all other such breaches,
      would have a Material Adverse Effect with respect to the Company;

            (c)   by the Company, if any of the conditions set forth in Section
      8.1 or 8.3 shall have become incapable of fulfillment, and shall not have
      been waived by the Company, or if Acquiror shall breach in any material
      respect any of its representations, warranties or obligations hereunder

      8.1(b), 8.1(c), 8.2(e), 8.2(h), 8.2(i) and 8.2(j)) have been satisfied at
      the Termination Date, either Acquiror or the Company may, by notice to the
      other prior to such date, extend the Termination Date to the latest date
      so extended by either party but in no event later than December 31, 1997;

            (e)   by either the Company or Acquiror if the Stockholder Approvals
      shall not have been obtained by reason of the failure to obtain the
      required vote upon a vote held at the Stockholders' Meetings (including


                                        88 

<PAGE>

      any postponements or adjournments thereof); PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that
      if the Stockholder Approvals are not obtained at the Initial Stockholders'
      Meeting solely by reason of a failure to obtain approval of the Charter
      Amendment, then this Agreement shall not be terminable unless the
      Stockholder Approvals shall not have been obtained by reason of a failure
      to obtain the required vote upon a vote held at the Additional
      Stockholders' Meeting;

            (f)   by Acquiror, if the Company shall have (i) withdrawn or

      stockholders of the Company, if the Board of Directors shall approve, and

      implementation of an Acquisition Proposal; PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that (i)
      the Company is not then in breach of Section 7.10, (ii) prior to such
      termination, the Company has negotiated with Acquiror in good faith to
      make such adjustments in the terms and conditions of this Agreement as
      would enable the Company to proceed with the transactions contemplated
      hereby and (iii) the Board of Directors, has determined in good faith (on
      the basis of the terms of such Acquisition Proposal and the terms of this
      Agreement, after giving effect to any concessions offered by Acquiror
      pursuant to clause (ii) above), after receipt of written advice from the
      Company's outside legal counsel, that such termination is advisable for
      the Board of Directors to act in a manner consistent with its fiduciary
      duties to stockholders under Applicable Law and (iv) the Company shall
      provide to Acquiror prior written notice of such termination, which notice
      shall advise Acquiror of the matters described in clauses (ii) and (iii)

the transactions contemplated by this Agreement shall be terminated, without
further action by any party.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, nothing in this

compel specific performance of the other party of its or their obligations under
this Agreement.

            9.3   FEES AND EXPENSES.  In order to induce Acquiror to, among

amended, modified or supplemented only by written agreement of Acquiror and the
Company at any time prior to the Effective Time with respect to any of the terms
contained herein; PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that, after this Agreement is approved
by the Company's stockholders, no such amendment or modification shall  (i)
alter or change the amount or kind of consideration to be delivered to the
stockholders of the Company or (ii) alter or change any of the terms and

waiver of such rights nor in any way effect the validity of this Agreement or
any part hereof or the right of such party thereafter to enforce each and every
provision of this Agreement.  No waiver of any breach of or non-compliance with
this Agreement shall be held to be a waiver of any other or subsequent breach or
non-compliance.

            10.1  FRUSTRATION OF THE CLOSING CONDITIONS.  Neither the Company
nor Acquiror may rely on the failure of any condition precedent set forth in

consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement in accordance with
Section 7.4.

Applicable Law, each party waives any objection to the imposition of such

as a defense or otherwise, in any such action, suit or proceeding any claim that
it is not subject personally to the jurisdiction of such court, that the action,
suit or proceeding is brought in an inconvenient forum, that the venue of the
action, suit or proceeding is improper or that this Agreement, any Transaction
Document, any other agreement or transaction or the subject matter hereof or
thereof may not be enforced in or by such court.  Each party hereto further and
irrevocably submits to the jurisdiction of such court in any action, suit or
proceeding.

<PAGE>

Statement covering such Registrable Securities has been declared effective under

            3.  PIGGY-BACK REGISTRATION RIGHTS.  (a)  Whenever Acquiror shall

the public offering of Media Stock for cash (other than pursuant to a
Registration Statement on Form S-4 or Form S-8 or any successor forms thereto,
or filed in connection with an exchange offer or an offering of securities
solely to existing stockholders or employees of Acquiror and other than pursuant
to a Registration Statement filed in connection with an offering by Acquiror of
securities convertible into or exchangeable for Media Stock) for sale for its
own account, Acquiror shall (i) give written notice at least fifteen Business
Days prior to the filing thereof to each Holder then outstanding, specifying the
approximate date on which Acquiror proposes to file such Registration Statement
and the intended method of distribution in connection therewith, and advising
such Holder of such Holder's right to have any or all of the Registrable
Securities then held by such Holder included among the securities to be covered
thereby and (ii) at the written request of any such Holder given to Acquiror at
least two Business Days prior to the proposed filing date, include among the
securities covered by such Registration Statement the number of Registrable
Securities that such Holder shall have requested be so included.  Subject to
reduction in accordance with paragraph (b) of this Section 3, Acquiror shall
cause the Registration Statement to include the Registrable Securities requested
to be included in the Registration Statement for such offering in the case of
Registrable Securities which are Media Stock, on the same terms and conditions
as the shares of Media Stock included therein and in the case of Registrable
Securities which are Series D Preferred Stock, on terms which would not conflict
or interfere with in any material respect (including, without limitation,
adversely affect the pricing of) the offering by Acquiror of Media Stock.



                                        5 
<PAGE>

            (b)  If the lead managing underwriter selected by Acquiror for an
underwritten offering pursuant to Section 3(a) determines in writing that
marketing factors require a limitation on the number of shares of Media Stock
and/or Series D Preferred Stock (or other securities convertible into or
exchangeable for Media Stock) to be offered and sold by stockholders of Acquiror
in such offering, there shall be included in the offering, first, all securities
proposed by Acquiror to be sold for its account and, second, only that number of
shares of Media Stock and Series D Preferred Stock (and other securities
convertible into or exchangeable for Media Stock), if any, requested to be
included in such Registration Statement by stockholders of Acquiror that such
lead managing underwriter reasonably and in good faith believes will not
substantially interfere with (including, without limitation, adversely affect
the pricing of) the offering of all the shares of Media Stock that the Company
desires to sell for its own account.  In such event and provided the managing
underwriter has so notified Acquiror in writing, the number of shares of Media
Stock and Series D Preferred Stock (and other securities of Acquiror convertible
into or exchangeable for Media Stock) to be offered and sold by stockholders of
Acquiror, including Holders of Registrable Securities, desiring to participate
in such offering shall be allocated among such stockholders of Acquiror on a pro
rata basis based upon the number of shares of Media Stock (assuming conversion
of the Series D Preferred Stock and other securities convertible into or
exchangeable for Media Stock held by such stockholders) each such stockholder
beneficially owns.

            (c)  Nothing in this Section 3 shall create any liability on the
part of Acquiror to the Holders of Registrable Securities if Acquiror for any
reason should decide not to file a Registration Statement proposed to be filed
under Section 3(a) or to withdraw such Registration Statement subsequent to its
filing, regardless of any action whatsoever that a Holder may have taken,
whether as a result of the issuance by Acquiror of any notice hereunder or
otherwise.

            (d)  A request by Holders to include Registrable Securities in a
proposed offering pursuant to Section 3(a) shall not be deemed to be a request
for a demand registration pursuant to Section 4.

            4.     DEMAND REGISTRATION RIGHTS.  (a)  Upon the written request
(the "Initial Request") of Holders of at


                                        6 
<PAGE>

least a majority in number of the Registrable Securities (assuming conversion of
all Series D Preferred Stock held by Holders) that Acquiror effect the
registration with the SEC under and in accordance with the provisions of the
Securities Act of all or part of such Holder's or Holders' Registrable
Securities and specifying the aggregate number of shares of Registrable
Securities requested to be so registered, Acquiror will promptly give written
notice of such requested registration to all other Holders.  Within 15 days
after receipt of Acquiror's notice (such 15 day period being the "Additional
Request Period"), each such other Holder shall notify Acquiror in writing as to
whether such Holder wishes to have any or all of its Registrable Securities
included in such requested registration.  Thereupon, subject to Section 4(f),
Acquiror shall use its best efforts to file a Registration Statement as
expeditiously as practicable (the terms of any underwritten offering or other
distribution to be determined by the Holders of a majority of the Registrable
Securities so requested to be registered); PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that Acquiror
shall not be required to take any action pursuant to this Section 4:

            (i)   if prior to the date of such request Acquiror shall have
      effected four registrations pursuant to this Section 4;

            (ii)  if Acquiror has effected a registration pursuant to this
      Section 4 within the 90-day period next preceding such request;

            (iii)  if Acquiror shall at the time have effective a Shelf
      Registration pursuant to which the Holder or Holders that requested
      registration could effect the disposition of such Registrable Securities
      pursuant to an underwritten offering or such other method of distribution
      requested by such Holder or Holders;

            (iv)  if the Registrable Securities that Acquiror shall have been
      requested to register shall have a then current market value of less than
      $100,000,000, unless such registration request is for all remaining
      Registrable Securities; or

            (v)   during the pendency of any Blackout Period;



                                        7 
<PAGE>

and PROVIDED, FURTHER, that Acquiror shall be permitted to satisfy its
obligations under this Section 4(a) by amending (to the extent permitted by
applicable law) any Shelf Registration previously filed by Acquiror under the
Securities Act so that such Shelf Registration (as amended) shall permit the
disposition (in accordance with the intended methods of disposition specified as
aforesaid) of all of the Registrable Securities for which a demand for
registration has been made under this Section 4(a).  If Acquiror shall so amend
a previously filed Shelf Registration, it shall be deemed to have effected a
registration for purposes of this Section 4.

            (b)  A registration requested pursuant to this Section 4 shall not
be deemed to be effected for purposes of this Section 4:  (i) if it has not been
declared effective by the SEC or become effective in accordance with the
Securities Act, (ii) if after it has become effective, such registration is
materially interfered with by any stop order, injunction or similar order or
requirement of the SEC or other governmental agency or court for any reason not
attributable to any of the Holders and has not thereafter become effective, or
(iii) if the conditions to closing specified in the underwriting agreement, if
any, entered into in connection with such registration are not satisfied or
waived, other than by reason of a failure on the part of any of the Holders.

            (c)  Should a Registration Statement filed pursuant to this Section
4 not become effective due to the failure of the Holders to perform their
obligations under this Agreement or the inability of the Holders to reach
agreement with the underwriters on price or other customary terms for such
transaction, or in the event the Holders of a majority in number of the
Registrable Securities (assuming conversion of all Series D Preferred Stock held
by Holders) determine to withdraw or do not pursue a request for registration
pursuant to this Section 4 (in each of the foregoing cases, provided that at
such time Acquiror is in compliance in all material respects with its
obligations under this Agreement), then (subject to the last sentence of this
Section 4(c)) such registration shall be deemed to have been effected for
purposes of this Section 4.  In such event, the Holders of Registrable
Securities who requested registration shall reimburse Acquiror for all its
out-of-pocket expenses incurred in the preparation, filing and processing of the
Registration Statement.  If such reimbursement is made within 30 Business Days
following a


                                        8 
<PAGE>

request therefor, such registration shall not be deemed to have been effected
for purposes of this Section 4.

            (d)  Acquiror will not include any securities that are not
Registrable Securities in any Registration Statement (including a Shelf
Registration referred to in the second proviso of Section 4(a)) filed pursuant
to a demand made under this Section 4 without the prior written consent of the
Holders of a majority in number of the Registrable Securities covered by such
Registration Statement (including a Shelf Registration referred to in the second
proviso of Section 4(a)).

            (e)  If the lead managing underwriter of an underwritten offering
made pursuant to this Section 4 shall advise Acquiror in writing (with a copy to
the Holders of Registrable Securities participating in such offering) that, in
its opinion, the number of Registrable Securities requested to be included in
such registration exceeds the number which can be sold in such offering within a
price range acceptable to the Holders of a majority in number of the Registrable
shares requested to be included in such offering, Acquiror will reduce to the
number which Acquiror is so advised can be sold in such offering within such
price range the Registrable Securities requested to be included in such
offering.  If, as a result of any such reduction, the number of Registrable
Securities requested to be included in such registration by the Holders of
Registrable Securities participating in such offering is reduced by twenty-five
percent (25%) or more, then notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained
in this Agreement, a registration will not be deemed to have been effected for
purposes of this Section 4; PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that the provisions of this
sentence shall only apply to the first request made by Holders for a
registration pursuant to this Section 4.  In the case of such a registration
which would have been deemed to be a registration for purposes of this Section 4
but for the application of the immediately preceding sentence, Acquiror
nonetheless shall pay the Registration Expenses in connection with such
registration.

            (f)  Prior to the filing by Acquiror of a Registration Statement
pursuant to Section 4(a), Acquiror shall have the right, exercisable for the ten
day period following the end of the Additional Request Period, upon written
notice to the Holders requesting registration, to purchase for cash from such
Holders on a pro rata basis all of the Registrable Securities which such Holders
requested


                                        9 
<PAGE>

to be registered pursuant to such Registration Statement (the "Purchased
Securities").  The exercise of such right shall constitute Acquiror's legal and
binding commitment to purchase the Purchased Securities in accordance with this
Section 4(f).  The closing of the purchase by Acquiror of the Purchased
Securities shall take place within 30 days of delivery of such notice and the
purchase price per Purchased Security shall be equal to the Current Market Price
of such Purchased Security on the date of the Initial Request, less the amount
of any customary discounts and commissions that would be payable by Acquiror or
a similar issuer in connection with an underwritten offering of similar
securities (which discounts and commissions shall not exceed 5% of such Current
Market Price).  At the closing of the sale of the Purchased Securities, the
Holders shall deliver to Acquiror certificates representing the Purchased
Securities and Acquiror shall deliver to the Holders the purchase price of the
Purchased Securities by wire transfer of immediately available funds.  Following
the purchase of the Purchased Shares by Acquiror, a registration shall be deemed
to have been effected for purposes of this Section 4.

            5.  SELECTION OF UNDERWRITERS.  In connection with any offering
pursuant to a Registration Statement filed pursuant to a demand made in
accordance with Section 4, Acquiror shall have the right to select a managing
underwriter or underwriters to administer the offering, so long as such managing
underwriter or underwriters shall be reasonably satisfactory to Holders of a
majority in number of the Registrable Securities to be included in such offering
(assuming conversion of all Series D Preferred Stock held by Holders);
PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that such Holders shall have the right to select one
co-managing underwriter, so long as such co-managing underwriter shall be
reasonably satisfactory to Acquiror.  The managing underwriter or underwriters
selected by Acquiror shall be deemed reasonably satisfactory to Holders of a
majority in number of the Registrable Securities to be included in such offering
(assuming conversion of all Series D Preferred Stock held by Holders) unless
such Holders sends a written notice of objection to Acquiror within 10 days of
receipt of notice from Acquiror of the appointment of a managing underwriter or
underwriters and the co-managing underwriter selected by such Holders shall be
deemed to be reasonably satisfactory to Acquiror unless Acquiror sends a written
notice of objection to such Holders within 10 days of receipt of notice from
such Holders of the appointment of a co-managing underwriter.

            6.  BLACKOUT PERIODS.  (a)  If Acquiror determines in good faith
that the registration and distribution of Registrable Securities (or the use of
the Registration Statement or related Prospectus) would interfere with any
pending financing, acquisition, corporate reorganization or any other corporate
development involving Acquiror or any of its subsidiaries (or would require
premature disclosure thereof) and promptly gives the Holders of Registrable
Securities written notice of such determination, Acquiror shall be entitled to
(i) postpone the filing of the Registration Statement otherwise required to be
prepared and filed by Acquiror pursuant to Section 3 or 4, or (ii) elect that
the Registration Statement not be used, in either case for a reasonable period
of time, but not to exceed 90 days (a "Section 6(a) Period").  Any such written
notice shall contain a general statement of the reasons for such postponement or
restriction on use and an estimate of the anticipated delay. Acquiror shall
promptly notify each Holder of the expiration or earlier termination of a
Section 6(a) Period.

            (b)  If (i) during the Effective Period, Acquiror shall file a
registration statement (other than in connection with the registration of
securities issuable pursuant to an employee stock option, stock purchase or
similar plan on Form S-8 or pursuant to a merger, exchange offer or a
transaction of the type specified in Rule 145(a) under the Securities Act) with
respect to any Related Securities and (ii) with reasonable written prior notice,
(A) Acquiror (in the case of a non-underwritten offering pursuant to such
registration statement) advises the Holders in writing that a sale or
distribution of Registrable Securities would adversely affect such offering or
(B) the managing underwriter or underwriters (in the case of an underwritten
offering) advise Acquiror in writing (in which case Acquiror shall notify the
Holders), that a sale or distribution of Registrable Securities would adversely
impact such offering, then each Holder shall, to the extent not inconsistent
with Applicable Law, refrain from effecting any sale or distribution of
Registrable Securities, including sales pursuant to Rule 144 under the
Securities Act, during the 10-day period prior to, and during the 90-day period
beginning on, the effective date of such registration statement (a "Section 6(b)
Period").

            (c)  The Effective Period and, in the case where the use of an
effective Registration Statement is prohibited under Section 6(a), the period
for which a Registration


                                        11 
<PAGE>

Statement shall be kept effective pursuant to Section 7(b), as the case may be,
shall be extended by a number of days equal to the number of days of any
Blackout Period occurring during such period.  Except as provided below, the
beginning of any Blackout Period shall be at least 120 days after the end of any
prior Blackout Period; PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that once during any consecutive
12 months during the Effective Period a Section 6(b) Period may begin on or
within five days of the last day of a Section 6(a) Period.  Notwithstanding
anything to the contrary contained herein, the aggregate number of days included
in all Blackout Periods during any consecutive 18 months during the Effective
Period shall not exceed 180 days.

            (d)  During the five day period prior to, and during the 30 day
period commencing on, the effective date of a registration statement filed by
Acquiror on behalf of Holders in connection with an underwritten offering
pursuant to Section 4(a), Acquiror hereby agrees not to effect (except pursuant
to employee benefit plans, the U S WEST Shareowner Investment Plan or a similar
plan) any public sale or distribution of (i) Media Stock, if the Registrable
Securities included in such registration include shares of Media Stock, and (ii)
preferred stock convertible into Media Stock, if the Registrable Securities
included in such registration include shares of Series D Preferred Stock.

            7.  REGISTRATION PROCEDURES.  If and whenever Acquiror is required
to use its best efforts to effect or cause the registration of any Registrable
Securities under the Securities Act as provided in this Agreement, Acquiror
shall, as expeditiously as possible:

            (a)   prepare and file with the SEC a Registration Statement with
      respect to such Registrable Securities on any form for which Acquiror then
      qualifies or that counsel for Acquiror shall deem appropriate, and which
      form shall be available for the sale of the Registrable Securities in
      accordance with the intended methods of distribution thereof, and use its
      best efforts to cause such Registration Statement to become and remain
      effective;

            (b)   prepare and file with the SEC amendments and post-effective
      amendments to such Registration Statement and such amendments and
      supplements to the Prospectus used in connection therewith as may be
      necessary to maintain the effectiveness of such


                                        12 
<PAGE>

      registration or as may be required by the rules, regulations or
      instructions applicable to the registration form utilized by Acquiror or
      by the Securities Act for a Shelf Registration or otherwise necessary to
      keep such Registration Statement effective for at least 90 days and cause
      the Prospectus as so supplemented to be filed pursuant to Rule 424 under
      the Securities Act, and to otherwise comply with the provisions of the
      Securities Act with respect to the disposition of all securities covered
      by such Registration Statement until the earlier of (x) such 90th day and
      (y) such time as all Registrable Securities covered by such Registration
      Statement have ceased to be Registrable Securities (it being understood
      that Acquiror at its option may determine to maintain such effectiveness
      for a longer period, whether pursuant to a Shelf Registration or
      otherwise); PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that a reasonable time before filing a
      Registration Statement or Prospectus, or any amendments or supplements
      thereto (other than reports required to be filed by it under the Exchange
      Act), Acquiror shall furnish to the Holders, the managing underwriter and
      their respective counsel for review and comment, copies of all documents
      proposed to be filed and shall not file any such documents (other than as
      aforesaid) to which any of them reasonably object prior to the filing
      thereof;

            (c)   furnish to each Holder of such Registrable Securities and to
      any underwriter in connection with an underwritten offer such number of
      conformed copies of such Registration Statement and of each amendment and
      post-effective amendment thereto (in each case including all exhibits) and
      such number of copies of any Prospectus or Prospectus supplement and such
      other documents as such Holder or underwriter may reasonably request in
      order to facilitate the disposition of the Registrable Securities by such
      Holder or underwriter (Acquiror hereby consenting to the use (subject to
      the limitations set forth in the last paragraph of this Section 7) of the
      Prospectus or any amendment or supplement thereto in connection with such
      disposition);

            (d)   use its best efforts to register or qualify such Registrable
      Securities covered by such Registration Statement under such other
      securities or "blue sky" laws of such jurisdictions as each Holder


                                        13 
<PAGE>

      shall reasonably request, except that Acquiror shall not for any such
      purpose be required to qualify generally to do business as a foreign
      corporation in any jurisdiction where, but for the requirements of this
      Section 7(d), it would not be obligated to be so qualified, to subject
      itself to taxation in any such jurisdiction, or to consent to general
      service of process in any such jurisdiction;

            (e)   notify each Holder of any such Registrable Securities covered
      by such Registration Statement, at any time when a Prospectus relating
      thereto is required to be delivered under the Securities Act within the
      appropriate period mentioned in Section 7(b), of Acquiror's becoming aware
      that the Prospectus included in such Registration Statement, as then in
      effect, includes an untrue statement of a material fact or omits to state
      a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the
      statements therein not misleading in light of the circumstances then
      existing, and at the request of any such Holder, prepare and furnish to
      such Holder a reasonable number of copies of an amendment or supplement to
      such Registration Statement or related Prospectus as may be necessary so
      that, as thereafter delivered to the purchasers of such Registrable
      Securities, such Prospectus shall not include an untrue statement of a
      material fact or omit to state a material fact required to be stated
      therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading in
      light of the circumstances then existing;

            (f)   notify each Holder covered by such Registration Statement at
      any time:

                  (i)   when the Prospectus or any Prospectus supplement or
            post-effective amendment has been filed, and, with respect to the
            Registration Statement or any post-effective amendment, when the
            same has become effective;

                  (ii)  of any request by the SEC for amendments or supplements
            to the Registration Statement or the Prospectus or for additional
            information;

                  (iii)  of the issuance by the SEC of any stop order suspending
            the effectiveness of the Registration Statement or any order
            preventing the


                                        14 
<PAGE>

            use of a related Prospectus, or the initiation (or any overt
            threats) of any proceedings for such purposes;

                  (iv)  of the receipt by Acquiror of any written notification
            of the suspension of the qualification of any of the Registrable
            Securities for sale in any jurisdiction or the initiation (or overt
            threats) of any proceeding for that purpose); and

                  (v)   if at any time the representations and warranties of
            Acquiror contemplated by paragraph (i)(1) below cease to be true and
            correct in all material respects;

            (g)   otherwise use its best efforts to comply with all applicable
      rules and regulations of the SEC, and make available to its security
      holders an earnings statement that shall satisfy the provisions of Section
      11(a) of the Securities Act, provided that Acquiror shall be deemed to
      have complied with this paragraph if it has complied with Rule 158 of the
      Securities Act;

            (h)   use its best efforts to cause all such Registrable Securities
      to be listed on any securities exchange on which the class of Registrable
      Securities being registered is then listed, if such Registrable Securities
      are not already so listed and if such listing is then permitted under the
      rules of such exchange, and to provide a transfer agent and registrar for
      such Registrable Securities covered by such Registration Statement no
      later than the effective date of such Registration Statement;

            (i)   enter into agreements (including an underwriting agreement in
      the form customarily entered into by Acquiror in a comparable underwritten
      offering) and take all other appropriate and all commercially reasonable
      actions in order to expedite or facilitate the disposition of such
      Registrable Securities and in such connection, whether or not an
      underwriting agreement is entered into and whether or not the registration
      is an underwritten registration:

                  (i)   make such representations and warranties to the Holders
            of such Registrable Securities and the underwriters, if any, in
            form, substance and


                                        15 
<PAGE>

            scope as are customarily made by Acquiror to underwriters in
            comparable underwritten offerings;

                  (ii)  obtain opinions of counsel to Acquiror and updates
            thereof (which counsel and opinions shall be reasonably satisfactory
            (in form, scope and substance) to the managing underwriters, if any,
            and the Holders of a majority in number of the Registrable
            Securities being sold) addressed to such Holders and the
            underwriters covering the matters customarily covered in opinions
            requested in comparable underwritten offerings by Acquiror;

                  (iii)  obtain "cold comfort" letters and updates thereof from
            Acquiror's independent certified public accountants addressed to the
            selling Holders of Registrable Securities and the underwriters, if
            any, such letters to be in customary form and covering matters of
            the type customarily covered in "cold comfort" letters by
            independent accountants in connection with comparable underwritten
            offerings on such date or dates as may be reasonably requested by
            the managing underwriter;

                  (iv)  provide the indemnification in accordance with the
            provisions and procedures of Section 10 hereof to all parties to be
            indemnified pursuant to such Section; and

                  (v)   deliver such documents and certificates as may be
            reasonably requested by the Holders of a majority in number of the
            Registrable Securities being sold and the managing underwriters, if
            any, to evidence compliance with clause (f) above and with any
            customary conditions contained in the underwriting agreement or
            other agreement entered into by Acquiror;

            (j)   cooperate with the Holders of Registrable Securities covered
      by such Registration Statement and the managing underwriter or
      underwriters to facilitate, to the extent reasonable under the
      circumstances, the timely preparation and delivery of certificates (not
      bearing any restrictive legends) representing the securities to be sold
      under such Registration Statement, and enable such securities to be in
      such denominations and registered in such names as the


                                        16 
<PAGE>

      managing underwriter or underwriters, if any, or such Holders may request
      and/or in a form eligible for deposit with the Depository Trust Company;

            (k)   make available for inspection by any Holder included in such
      Registration Statement, any underwriter participating in any disposition
      pursuant to such Registration Statement, and any attorney, accountant or
      other agent retained by any such Holder or underwriter (collectively, the
      "Inspectors"), reasonable access to appropriate officers of Acquiror and
      Acquiror's subsidiaries to ask questions and to obtain information
      reasonably requested by such Inspector and all financial and other records
      and other information, pertinent corporate documents and properties of any
      of Acquiror and its subsidiaries and affiliates (collectively, the
      "Records"), as shall be reasonably necessary to enable them to exercise
      their due diligence responsibility; PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that the
      Records that Acquiror determines, in good faith, to be confidential and
      which it notifies the Inspectors in writing are confidential shall not be
      disclosed to any Inspector unless such Inspector signs a confidentiality
      agreement reasonably satisfactory to Acquiror or either (i) the disclosure
      of such Records is necessary to avoid or correct a misstatement or
      omission of a material fact in such Registration Statement or (ii) the
      release of such Records is ordered pursuant to a subpoena or other order
      from a court of competent jurisdiction; PROVIDED, FURTHER, that any
      decision regarding the disclosure of information pursuant to subclause (i)
      shall be made only after consultation with counsel for the applicable
      Inspectors; and PROVIDED, FURTHER, that each Holder agrees that it
      will, promptly after learning that disclosure of such Records is sought in
      a court having jurisdiction, give notice to Acquiror and allow Acquiror,
      at Acquiror's expense, to undertake appropriate action to prevent
      disclosure of such Records; and

            (l)   in the event of the issuance of any stop order suspending the
      effectiveness of the Registration Statement or of any order suspending or
      preventing the use of any related Prospectus or suspending the
      qualification of any Registrable Securities included in the Registration
      Statement for sale in any jurisdiction, Acquiror will use all commercially
      reasonable efforts promptly to obtain its withdrawal.


                                        17 
<PAGE>



            Acquiror may require each Holder as to which any registration is
being effected to furnish Acquiror with such information regarding such Holder
and pertinent to the disclosure requirements relating to the registration and
the distribution of such securities as Acquiror may from time to time reasonably
request in writing.

            Each Holder agrees that, upon receipt of any notice from Acquiror of
the happening of any event of the kind described in Section 7(e), such Holder
shall forthwith discontinue disposition of Registrable Securities pursuant to
the Prospectus or Registration Statement covering such Registrable Securities
until such Holder's receipt of the copies of the supplemented or amended
Prospectus contemplated by Section 7(e), and, if so directed by Acquiror, such
Holder will deliver to Acquiror (at Acquiror's expense) all copies, other than
permanent file copies then in such Holder's possession, of the Prospectus
covering such Registrable Securities current at the time of receipt of such
notice.  In the event Acquiror shall give any such notice, the Effective Period
and the period mentioned in Section 7(b) shall be extended by the number of days
during the period from the date of the giving of such notice pursuant to Section
7(e) and through the date when each seller of Registrable Securities covered by
such Registration Statement shall have received the copies of the supplemented
or amended Prospectus contemplated by Section 7(e).

            8.  REGISTRATION EXPENSES.  Acquiror shall pay all Registration
Expenses in connection with all registrations of Registrable Securities pursuant
to Sections 3 and 4 and each Holder shall pay (x) all fees and expenses of
counsel to such Holder and any counsel to the Holders and (y) all underwriting
discounts and commissions and transfer taxes, if any, relating to the sale or
disposition of such Holder's Registrable Securities pursuant to the Registration
Statement.

            9.  RULE 144.  Acquiror agrees that it shall timely file the
reports required to be filed by it under the Securities Act or the Exchange Act
(including, without limitation, the reports under sections 13 and 15 (d) of the
Exchange Act referred to in paragraph (c)(1) of Rule 144 under the Securities
Act), and shall take such further actions as any Holder may reasonably request,
all to the extent required to enable Holders to sell Registrable


                                        18 
<PAGE>

Securities, from time to time, pursuant to the resale limitations of (a) Rule
144 under the Securities Act, as such rule may be hereafter amended, or (b) any
similar rules or regulations hereafter adopted by the SEC.  Upon the written
request of any Holder, Acquiror shall deliver to such Holder a written statement
verifying that it has complied with such requirements.

            10.  INDEMNIFICATION; CONTRIBUTION.  (a)  INDEMNIFICATION BY
ACQUIROR.  Acquiror agrees to indemnify and hold harmless each Holder included
in any registration of Registrable Securities pursuant to this Agreement, its
trustees, officers and directors and each Person who controls such Holder
(within the meaning of Section 15 of the Securities Act or Section 20 of the
Exchange Act), and any agent or investment adviser thereof against all losses,
claims, damages, liabilities and expenses (including reasonable attorneys' fees
and expenses) incurred by such party pursuant to any actual or threatened
action, suit, proceeding or investigation arising out of or based upon (i) any
untrue or alleged untrue statement of material fact contained in any
Registration Statement, any Prospectus or preliminary Prospectus, or any
amendment or supplement to any of the foregoing or (ii) any omission or alleged
omission to state therein a material fact required to be stated therein or
necessary to make the statements therein (in the case of a Prospectus or a
preliminary Prospectus, in light of the circumstances then existing) not
misleading, except in each case insofar as the same arise out of or are based
upon, any such untrue statement or omission made in reliance on and in
conformity with information with respect to such Holder furnished in writing to
Acquiror by such Holder or its counsel expressly for use therein.  In connection
with an underwritten offering, Acquiror will indemnify the underwriters thereof,
their officers, directors and agents and each Person who controls such
underwriters (within the meaning of Section 15 of the Securities Act or Section
20 of the Exchange Act) to the same extent as provided above with respect to the
indemnification of the Holders. Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of this
Section 10(a), Acquiror will not be liable to any Holder, any Person who
participates as an underwriter in the offering or sale of Registrable Securities
or any other Person, if any, who controls such Holder or underwriter (within the
meaning of Section 15 of the Securities Act or Section 20 of the Exchange Act),
under the indemnity agreement in this Section 10(a) for any such loss, claim,
damage, liability (or action or proceeding in


                                        19 
<PAGE>

respect thereof) or expense that arises out of such Holder's or other Person's
failure to send or deliver a copy of a final Prospectus to the Person asserting
an untrue statement or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission
at or prior to the written confirmation of the sale of the Registrable
Securities to such Person if such statement or omission was corrected in such
final Prospectus and Acquiror has previously furnished copies thereof to such
Holder in accordance with this Agreement.

            (b)   INDEMNIFICATION BY HOLDERS OF REGISTRABLE SECURITIES.  In
connection with the any registration of Registrable Securities pursuant to this
Agreement, each Holder included in such registration shall furnish to Acquiror
and any underwriter in writing such information, including the name, address and
the amount of Registrable Securities held by such Holder, as Acquiror or any
underwriter reasonably requests for use in the Registration Statement relating
to such registration or the related Prospectus and agrees to indemnify and hold
harmless Acquiror, all other Holders and any underwriter, each such party's
officers and directors and each Person who controls each such party (within the
meaning of Section 15 of the Securities Act or Section 20 of the Exchange Act),
and any agent or investment adviser thereof against all losses, claims, damages,
liabilities and expenses (including reasonable attorneys' fees and expenses)
incurred by each such party pursuant to any actual or threatened action, suit,
proceeding or investigation arising out of or based upon (i) any untrue or
alleged untrue statement of material fact contained in any Registration
Statement, any Prospectus or preliminary Prospectus, or any amendment or
supplement to any of the foregoing or (ii) any omission or alleged omission to
state therein a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make
the statements therein (in the case of a Prospectus or a preliminary Prospectus,
in light of the circumstances then existing) not misleading, but only to the
extent that any such untrue statement or omission is made in reliance on and in
conformity with information with respect to such Holder furnished in writing to
Acquiror or any underwriter by such Holder or its counsel specifically for
inclusion therein.

            (c)   CONDUCT OF INDEMNIFICATION PROCEEDINGS.  Any Person entitled
to indemnification hereunder agrees to give prompt written notice to the
indemnifying party after the receipt by such indemnified party of any written
notice of the commencement of any action, suit, proceeding or


                                        20 
<PAGE>

investigation or threat thereof made in writing for which such indemnified party
may claim indemnification or contribution pursuant to this Section 10 (provided
that failure to give such notification shall not affect the obligations of the
indemnifying party pursuant to this Section 10 except to the extent the
indemnifying party shall have been actually prejudiced as a result of such
failure). In case any such action shall be brought against any indemnified party
and it shall notify the indemnifying party of the commencement thereof, the
indemnifying party shall be entitled to participate therein and, to the extent
that it shall wish, jointly with any other indemnifying party similarly
notified, to assume the defense thereof, with counsel satisfactory to such
indemnified party (who shall not, except with the consent of the indemnified
party, be counsel to the indemnifying party), and after notice from the
indemnifying party to such indemnified party of its election so to assume the
defense thereof, the indemnifying party shall not be liable to such indemnified
party under these indemnification provisions for any legal expenses of other
counsel or any other expenses, in each case subsequently incurred by such
indemnified party, in connection with the defense thereof other than reasonable
costs of investigation.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, if (i) the indemnifying
party shall not have employed counsel reasonably satisfactory to such
indemnified party to take charge of the defense of such action within a
reasonable time after notice of commencement of such action (so long as such
failure to employ counsel is not the result of an unreasonable determination by
such indemnified party that counsel selected pursuant to the immediately
preceding sentence is unsatisfactory), or (ii) the actual or potential
defendants in, or targets of, any such action include both the indemnifying
party and such indemnified party and such indemnified party shall have
reasonably concluded that there may be legal defenses available to it which are
different from or additional to those available to the indemnifying party which,
if the indemnifying party and such indemnified party were to be represented by
the same counsel, could result in a conflict of interest for such counsel or
materially prejudice the prosecution of the defenses available to such
indemnified party, then such indemnified party shall have the right to employ
separate counsel, in which case the fees and expenses of one counsel or firm of
counsel (plus one local or regulatory counsel or firm of counsel) selected by a
majority in interest of the indemnified parties shall be borne by the
indemnifying party and the fees and expenses of all other counsel retained by


                                        21 
<PAGE>

the indemnified parties shall be paid by the indemnified parties.  No
indemnified party shall consent to entry of any judgment or enter into any
settlement without the consent (which consent, in the case of an action, suit,
claim or proceeding exclusively seeking monetary relief, shall not be
unreasonably withheld) of each indemnifying party.

            (d)   CONTRIBUTION.  If the indemnification from the indemnifying
party provided for in this Section 10 is unavailable to an indemnified party
hereunder in respect of any losses, claims, damages, liabilities or expenses
referred to therein, then the indemnifying party, in lieu of indemnifying such
indemnified party, shall contribute to the amount paid or payable by such
indemnified party as a result of such losses, claims, damages, liabilities and
expenses in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect the relative fault of
the indemnifying party and indemnified party in connection with the actions
which resulted in such losses, claims, damages, liabilities and expenses, as
well as any other relevant equitable considerations.  The relative fault of such
indemnifying party and indemnified party shall be determined by reference to,
among other things, whether any action in question, including any untrue or
alleged untrue statement of a material fact or omission or alleged omission to
state a material fact, has been made by, or relates to information supplied by,
such indemnifying party or indemnified party, and the parties' relative intent,
knowledge, access to information and opportunity to correct or prevent such
action.  The amount paid or payable by a party as a result of the losses,
claims, damages, liabilities and expenses referred to above shall be deemed to
include, subject to the limitations set forth in Section 10(c), any legal and
other fees and expenses reasonably incurred by such indemnified party in
connection with any investigation or proceeding.

            The parties hereto agree that it would not be just and equitable if
contribution pursuant to this Section 10(d) were determined by pro rata
allocation or by any other method of allocation which does not take account of
the equitable considerations referred to in the immediately preceding paragraph.
Notwithstanding the provisions of this Section 10(d), no underwriter shall be
required to contribute any amount in excess of the amount by which the total
price at which the Registrable Securities underwritten by it and distributed to
the public were offered to the public exceeds the amount of any damages which
such underwriter has otherwise been required to pay by reason of


                                        22 
<PAGE>

such untrue or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission and no
Holder shall be required to contribute any amount in excess of the amount by
which the total price at which the Registrable Securities of such Holder were
offered to the public exceeds the amount of any damages which such Holder has
otherwise been required to pay by reason of such untrue or alleged untrue
statement or omission or alleged omission.  No Person guilty of fraudulent
misrepresentation (within the meaning of Section 11(f) of the Securities Act)
shall be entitled to contribution from any Person who was not guilty of such
fraudulent misrepresentation.

            If indemnification is available under this Section 10, the
indemnifying parties shall indemnify each indemnified party to the fullest
extent provided in Section 10(a) or (b), as the case may be, without regard to
the relative fault of such indemnifying parties or indemnified party or any
other equitable consideration provided for in this Section 10(d).

            (e)   The provisions of this Section 10 shall be in addition to any
liability which any party may have to any other party and shall survive any
termination of this Agreement.  The indemnification provided by this Section 10
shall remain in full force and effect irrespective of any investigation made by
or on behalf of an indemnified party, so long as such indemnified party does not
act in a fraudulent, reckless or grossly negligent manner.

            11.   PARTICIPATION IN UNDERWRITTEN OFFERINGS.  No Holder may
participate in any underwritten offering hereunder unless such Holder (a) in the
case of a registration pursuant to Section 3, agrees to sell such Holder's
securities on the basis provided in any underwriting arrangements approved by
Acquiror in its reasonable discretion and (b) completes and executes all
questionnaires, powers of attorney, indemnities, underwriting agreements and
other documents reasonably required under the terms of such underwriting
arrangements.

            12.   MISCELLANEOUS.  (a)  REMEDIES.  Each Holder, in addition
to being entitled to exercise all rights granted by law, including recovery of
damages, will be entitled to specific performance of its rights under this
Agreement.

            (b)   AMENDMENTS AND WAIVERS.  Except as otherwise provided
herein, the provisions of this Agreement may not be


                                        23 
<PAGE>

amended, modified or supplemented, and waivers or consents to departures from
the provisions hereof may not be given, unless Acquiror has obtained the written
consent of Holders of at least a majority in number of the Registrable
Securities then outstanding.

            (c)   NOTICES. Notices, requests, permissions, waivers, and other
communications hereunder shall be in writing and shall be deemed to have been
duly given if signed by the respective Persons giving them (in the case of any
corporation the signature shall be by an officer thereof) and delivered by hand,
deposited in the United States mail (registered or certified, return receipt
requested), properly addressed and postage prepaid, or delivered by telecopy:

         2.   DIVIDENDS.

              2.1  The holders of the outstanding Series D Stock shall be
entitled to receive dividends, as and when declared by the Board of Directors
out of funds legally


                                          8

<PAGE>

available therefor, and any dividends declared by the Board of Directors out of
funds legally available therefor in accordance with Section 3.6(d).  Each
dividend shall be at the annual rate equal to ____% per share of Series D Stock
(which is equivalent to $__________ quarterly and $__________ annually per
share). (1)  All dividends shall be

- -------------------------

1.  The dividend rate (the "Dividend Rate") shall be equal to the sum of 4.375%
(the "Base Dividend Rate") plus the Adjustment Amount (as defined below).  If
the Calculation Price (as defined in the Merger Agreement) is less than $24.50,
the Corporation shall have the right, in its sole discretion, to (i) increase
the Base Dividend Rate to 6.00% and (ii) increase the Conversion Rate pursuant
to footnote 2.

    The Base Dividend Rate shall be subject to adjustment in the following
manner:

     (i) If the Adjustment Amount is less than seven basis points in absolute
         terms, then the Adjustment Amount shall be deemed to be zero and the
         Dividend Rate shall equal the Base Dividend Rate.

    (ii) If the Adjustment Amount is greater than or equal to seven basis
         points in absolute terms, then the Dividend Rate shall be equal to the
         Base Dividend Rate plus the Adjustment Amount, rounded to the nearest
         multiple of 0.125%.

    "Adjustment Amount" shall be equal to the product of (x) the sum of (1) the
Change In Weighted Average Yield plus (2) the Change In Credit Spread multiplied
by (y) the Discount Factor.

    "Change In Weighted Average Yield" shall equal the sum (whether positive or
negative) of the following, based upon the average market closing levels of
Treasury securities for the 10 Trading Days ending 5 Trading Days prior to the
Effective Time:

     (i) the change (whether positive or negative) since February 27, 1996 in
         basis points in 3-year Treasury yields x 0.25;

                                                                  (continued...)


                                          9

<PAGE>

payable in cash on or about the first day of November, February, May and August
in each year, beginning on the first such date that is more than 15 days after
the Effective Time, as fixed by the Board of Directors, or such other dates as
are fixed by the Board of Directors (each a "Dividend Payment Date"), to the
holders of record of Series D Stock at the close of business on or about the
15th day of the month next preceding such first day of January, April, July or
October as the case may be, as fixed by the

- -------------------------

1.  (...continued)
    (ii) the change (whether positive or negative) since February 27, 1996 in
         basis points in 5-year Treasury yields x 0.25;

   (iii) the change (whether positive or negative) since February 27, 1996 in
         basis points in 10-year Treasury yields x 0.25; and

    (iv) the change (whether positive or negative) since February 27, 1996 in
         basis points in 20-year Treasury yields x 0.25.

    "Change In Credit Spread" shall equal (whether positive or negative) the
average credit spread measured in basis points on U S WEST Financing I's 7.96%
Trust Originated Preferred Securities (based upon the closing market price
expressed as a stripped current yield) over the 30-year Treasury "pricing bond"
for the 10 Trading Days ending 5 Trading Days prior to the Effective Time minus
159.5 basis points.

    "Discount Factor" shall equal 0.55.

    For example, if (i) the Base Dividend Rate is 4.375%, (ii) the average
3-year Treasury, 5-year Treasury, 10-year Treasury and 20-year Treasury yields
are each 20 basis points lower at the Effective Time than they are on February
27, 1996 and (iii) the Change In Credit Spread is fifty basis points, then the
Adjustment Amount shall equal 16.5 basis points ((-20 basis points + fifty basis
points) x 0.55).  Because such Adjustment Amount is greater than seven basis
points, the Dividend Rate would be equal to the Base Dividend Rate plus the
Adjustment Amount (or 4.540%), rounded to the yield which is at the nearest
multiple of 0.125% (or 4.500%).


                                          10

Board of Directors, or such other dates as are fixed by the Board of Directors
(each a "Record Date").  Such dividends shall accrue on each share cumulatively
on a daily basis, whether or not there are unrestricted funds legally available
for the payment of such dividends and whether or not earned or declared, from
and after the day immediately succeeding the Effective Time and any such
dividends that become payable for any partial dividend period shall be computed
on the basis of the actual days elapsed in such period.  All dividends that
accrue in accordance with the foregoing provisions shall be cumulative from and
after the day immediately succeeding the Effective Time.  The per share dividend
amount payable to each holder of record of Series D Stock on any Dividend
Payment Date shall be rounded to the nearest cent.  The dividend rate per share
of this Series shall be appropriately adjusted from time to time to reflect any
split or combination of the shares of this Series.

              2.2  Except as hereinafter provided in this Section 2.2 and
except for redemptions by the Corporation pursuant to Sections 4.1(b), 4.1(c) or
4.1(d), unless all dividends on the outstanding shares of Series D Stock and any
Parity Stock that shall have accrued through any prior Dividend Payment Date
shall have been paid, or declared and funds set apart for payment thereof, no
dividend or other distribution (payable other than in shares of Junior Stock)
shall be paid to the holders of Junior Stock or Parity Stock, and no shares of
Series D Stock, Parity Stock or Junior Stock shall be purchased, redeemed or
otherwise acquired by the Corporation or any of its subsidiaries (except by
conversion into or exchange for Junior Stock), nor shall any monies be paid or
made available for a purchase, redemption or sinking fund for the purchase or
redemption of any Series D Stock, Junior Stock or Parity Stock.  When dividends
are not paid in full upon the shares of this Series and any Parity Stock, all
dividends declared upon shares of this Series and all Parity Stock shall be
declared pro rata so that the amount of dividends declared per share on this
Series and all such Parity Stock shall in all cases bear to each other the same
ratio that accrued dividends per share on the shares of this Series and all such
Parity Stock bear to each other.  No interest, or sum of money in lieu of
interest, shall be payable in respect of any dividend payment or payments on
this Series which may be in arrears.

         3.   CONVERSION RIGHTS.

              3.1  (a)  Subject to Section 3.1(b), each holder of a share of
this Series shall have the right at any time to convert such share into a number
of shares of Media Stock equal to [   ] shares of Media Stock for each share of
this Series, subject to adjustment as provided in this Section 3 (such rate, as
so adjusted from time to time, is herein called the "Conversion Rate"; and the
"Conversion Price" at any time shall mean the Liquidation Value per share
divided by the Conversion Rate in effect at such time (rounded to the nearest
one hundredth of a cent)) (2).


              (b)  The right of a holder of a share of this Series called for
redemption or exchange pursuant to Sections 4.1(a) or 4.1(c) to convert such
share into Media Stock (or such other class or series of common stock into which
shares of this Series are then convertible) pursuant to Section 3.1(a) shall
terminate at the close of business on the Redemption Date unless the Corporation
defaults in the payment of the Redemption Price or Exchange Rate or, in the case
of a redemption or exchange pursuant to Section 4.1(a), the Corporation
exercises its right to rescind such redemption or exchange pursuant to Section
4.5, in which case such right of conversion shall not terminate at the close of
business on such date.  The right of a holder of a share of this Series called
for redemption pursuant to Section 4.1(b):  (i) in connection with a Media Group
Subsidiary Redemption, a Media Group Tender or Exchange Offer or a Media Group
Disposition Redemption involving a Disposition of all (not merely substantially
all) of the properties and assets attributed to the Media Group, to convert such
share into Media Stock pursuant to Section 3.1(a) shall terminate at the close
of business on the Redemption Date; (ii) in connection with a Media Group
Disposition Dividend or Media Group Special Dividend, to

- -------------------------

2.  The Conversion Rate shall be equal to the quotient of (x) $50 divided by
(y) the product of (I) 1.25 multiplied by (II) the Calculation Price (as defined
in the Merger Agreement).  If the Calculation Price is less than $24.50, the
Corporation shall have the right, in its sole discretion, to (i) set the
Conversion Rate equal to the quotient of (x) $50 divided by (y) the product of
(I) 1.40 multiplied by (II) the Calculation Price and (ii) increase the Base
Dividend Rate in accordance with footnote 1.


                                          12

<PAGE>

convert such share into Media Stock pursuant to Section 3.1(a) shall terminate
at the close of business on the record date for determining holders entitled to
receive such dividend; and (iii) in connection with a Media Group Disposition
Redemption involving a Disposition of substantially all (but not all) of the
properties and assets attributed to the Media Group, to convert such share into
Media Stock shall terminate at the close of business on the date on which shares
of Media Stock are selected to be redeemed in such Media Group Disposition
Redemption, unless, in any of the foregoing cases, the Corporation defaults in
the payment of the Redemption Price or the conditions to such redemption set
forth in the last sentence of Section 4.1(b) shall not have been satisfied, in
which event such right of conversion shall not terminate at the close of
business on such date.  In the event the Corporation converts all of the
outstanding shares of Media Stock into shares of Communications Stock (or, if
the Communications Stock is not Publicly Traded at such time and shares of any
other class or series of common stock of the Corporation (other than Media
Stock) are then Publicly Traded, of such other class or series of common stock
as has the largest Market Capitalization), the right of a holder of a share of
this Series called for redemption pursuant to Section 4.1(d) in connection with
an event substantially similar to a Media Group Special Event to convert such
share into Communications Stock (or such other class or series of common stock)
shall terminate on a date comparable to the date specified in the preceding
sentence with respect to a Media Group Special Event substantially similar to
such event.


              3.2  If any shares of this Series are surrendered for conversion
subsequent to the Record Date preceding a Dividend Payment Date but on or prior
to such Dividend Payment Date (except shares called for redemption or exchange
on a Redemption Date between such Record Date and Dividend Payment Date and with
respect to which such redemption or exchange has not been rescinded), the
registered holder of such shares at the close of business on such Record Date
shall be entitled to receive the dividend, if any, payable on such shares on
such Dividend Payment Date notwithstanding the conversion thereof.  Except as
provided in this Section 3.2, no adjustments in respect of payments of dividends
on shares surrendered for conversion or any dividend on the Media Stock issued
upon conversion shall be made upon the conversion of any shares of this Series.


                                          13

<PAGE>

              3.3  The Corporation may, but shall not be required to, in
connection with any conversion of shares of this Series, issue a fraction of a
share of Media Stock, and if the Corporation shall determine not to issue any
such fraction, the Corporation shall, subject to Section 3.6(g), make a cash
payment (rounded to the nearest cent) equal to such fraction multiplied by the
Closing Price of the Media Stock on the last Trading Day prior to the date of
conversion.

              3.4  Any holder of shares of this Series electing to convert such
shares into Media Stock shall surrender the certificate or certificates for such
shares at the office of the transfer agent or agents therefor (or at such other
place in the United States as the Corporation may designate by notice to the
holders of shares of this Series) during regular business hours, duly endorsed
to the Corporation or in blank, or accompanied by instruments of transfer to the
Corporation or in blank, or in form satisfactory to the Corporation, and shall
give written notice to the Corporation at such office that such holder elects to
convert such shares of this Series.  The Corporation shall, as soon as
practicable and in any event within five Trading Days (subject to Section
3.6(g)) after such surrender of certificates for shares of this Series,
accompanied by the written notice above prescribed issue and deliver at such
office to the holder for whose account such shares were surrendered, or to his
nominee, (i) certificates representing the number of shares of Media Stock to
which such holder is entitled upon such conversion and (ii) if less than the
full number of shares of this Series represented by such certificate or
certificates is being converted, a new certificate of like tenor representing
the shares of this Series not converted.

              3.5  Conversion shall be deemed to have been made immediately
prior to the close of business as of the date that certificates for the shares
of this Series to be converted, and the written notice prescribed in Section
3.4, are received by the transfer agent or agents for this Series (such date
being referred to herein as the "Conversion Date"). The Person entitled to
receive the Media Stock issuable upon such conversion shall be treated for all
purposes as the record holder of such Media Stock as of the close of business on
the Conversion Date and such conversion shall be at the Conversion Rate in
effect on such date.  Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein,


                                          14

<PAGE>

in the event the Corporation shall have rescinded a redemption or exchange of
shares of this Series pursuant to Section 4.5, any holder of shares of this
Series that shall have surrendered shares of this Series for conversion
following the day on which notice of the redemption or exchange shall have been
given but prior to the later of (a) the close of business on the Trading Day
next succeeding the date on which public announcement of the rescission of such
redemption or exchange shall have been made and (b) the date which is three
Trading Days following the mailing of the notice of rescission required by
Section 4.5 (a "Converting Holder") may rescind the conversion of such shares
surrendered for conversion by (i) properly completing a form prescribed by the
Corporation and mailed to holders of shares of this Series (including Converting
Holders) with the Corporation's notice of rescission, which form shall provide
for the certification by any Converting Holder rescinding a conversion on behalf
of any beneficial owner (within the meaning of Rule 13d-3 under the Exchange
Act) of shares of this Series that the beneficial ownership (within the meaning
of such Rule) of such shares shall not have changed from the date on which such
shares were surrendered for conversion to the date of such certification and
(ii) delivering such form to the Corporation no later than the close of business
on that date which is fifteen (15) Trading Days following the date of the
mailing of the Corporation's notice of rescission.  The delivery of such form by
a Converting Holder shall be accompanied by (x) any certificates representing
shares of Media Stock issued to such Converting Holder upon a conversion of
shares of this Series that shall be rescinded by the proper delivery of such
form (the "Surrendered Shares"), (y) any securities, evidences of indebtedness
or assets (other than cash) distributed by the Corporation to such Converting
Holder by reason of such Converting Holder's being a record holder of the
Surrendered Shares and (z) payment in New York Clearing House funds or other
funds acceptable to the Corporation of an amount equal to the sum of (I) any
cash such Converting Holder may have received in lieu of the issuance of
fractional shares upon conversion and (II) any cash paid or payable by the
Corporation to such Converting Holder by reason of such Converting Holder being
a record holder of the Surrendered Shares.  Upon receipt by the Corporation of
any such form properly completed by a Converting Holder and any certificates,
securities, evidences of indebtedness, assets or cash payments required to be
returned or made by such Converting Holder to the Corporation as set forth


                                          15

<PAGE>

above, the Corporation shall instruct the transfer agent or agents for shares of
Media Stock and shares of this Series to cancel any certificates representing
the Surrendered Shares (which Surrendered Shares shall be deposited in the
treasury of the Corporation) and reissue certificates representing shares of
this Series to such Converting Holder (which shares of this Series shall,
notwithstanding their surrender for conversion, be deemed to have been
outstanding at all times).  The Corporation shall, as promptly as practicable,
and in no event more than five (5) Trading Days, following the receipt of any
such properly completed form and any such certificates, securities, evidences of
indebtedness, assets or cash payments required to be so returned or made, pay to
the Converting Holder or as otherwise directed by such Converting Holder any
dividend or other payment made on such shares of this Series during the period
from the time such shares shall have been surrendered for conversion to the
rescission of such conversion.  All questions as to the validity, form,
eligibility (including time of receipt) and acceptance of any form submitted to
the Corporation to rescind the conversion of shares of this Series, including
questions as to the proper completion or execution of any such form or any
certification contained therein, shall be resolved by the Corporation, whose
good faith determination shall be final and binding.  The Corporation shall not
be required to deliver certificates for shares of Media Stock while the stock
transfer books for such stock or for this Series are duly closed for any purpose
(but not for a period in excess of two Trading Days) or during any period
commencing at a Redemption Rescission Event and ending at either (i) the time
and date at which the Corporation's right of rescission shall expire pursuant to
Section 4.5 if the Corporation shall not have exercised such right or (ii) the
close of business on that day which is fifteen (15) Trading Days following the
date of the mailing of a notice of rescission pursuant to Section 4.5 if the
Corporation shall have exercised such right of rescission, but certificates for
shares of Media Stock shall be delivered as soon as practicable after the
opening of such books or the expiration of such period.

              3.6  The Conversion Rate shall be adjusted from time to time as
follows for events occurring after the Effective Time:

              (a)  In case the Corporation shall, at any time or from time to
    time, (i) pay a dividend or make a


                                          16

<PAGE>

    distribution in shares of Media Stock, (ii) combine the outstanding shares
    of Media Stock into a smaller number of shares, or (iii) subdivide or
    reclassify the outstanding shares of Media Stock, then the Conversion Rate
    in effect immediately before such action shall be adjusted so that
    immediately following such event the holders of the Series D Stock shall be
    entitled to receive upon conversion thereof the kind and amount of shares
    of capital stock of the Corporation which they would have owned or been
    entitled to receive upon or by reason of such event if such shares of
    Series D Stock had been converted immediately before the record date (or,
    if no record date, the effective date) for such event.  An adjustment made
    pursuant to this Section 3.6(a) shall become effective immediately after
    the opening of business on the day next following the record date in the
    case of a dividend or distribution and shall become effective immediately
    after the opening of business on the day next following the effective date
    in the case of a subdivision, combination or reclassification.  For the
    purposes of this Section 3.6(a), if holders of Media Stock are entitled to
    elect the kind or amount of securities receivable upon the payment of any
    such divided, subdivision, combination or reclassification, each holder of
    Series D Stock shall be deemed to have failed to exercise any such right of
    election (provided that if the kind or amount of securities receivable upon
    such dividend, distribution, subdivision, combination or reclassification
    is not the same for each nonelecting share, then the kind and amount of
    securities receivable upon such dividend, distribution, subdivision,
    combination or reclassification for each nonelecting share shall be deemed
    to be the kind and amount so receivable per share by a plurality of the
    nonelecting shares).

              (b)  If the Corporation shall issue rights, warrants or options
    to all holders of Media Stock entitling them (for a period not exceeding 45
    days from the record date referred to below) to subscribe for or purchase
    shares of Media Stock at a price per share less than the Current Market
    Price (determined as of the record date for the determination of
    stockholders entitled to receive such rights, warrants or options), then,
    in any such event, the Conversion Rate shall be adjusted by multiplying the
    Conversion Rate in effect


                                          17

<PAGE>

    immediately prior to the opening of business on such record date by a
    fraction, the numerator of which shall be the number of shares of Media
    Stock outstanding on such record date plus the maximum number of additional
    shares of Media Stock offered for subscription pursuant to such rights,
    warrants or options, and the denominator of which shall be the number of
    shares of Media Stock outstanding on such record date plus the maximum
    number of additional shares of Media Stock which the aggregate offering
    price of the maximum number of shares of Media Stock so offered for
    subscription or purchase pursuant to such rights, warrants or options would
    purchase at such Current Market Price (determined by multiplying such
    maximum number of shares by the exercise price of such rights, warrants or
    options (plus any other consideration received by the Corporation upon the
    issuance or exercise of such rights, warrants or options) and dividing the
    product so obtained by such Current Market Price).  Such adjustment shall
    become effective at the opening of business on the day next following the
    record date for the determination of stockholders entitled to receive such
    rights, warrants or options.  To the extent that shares of Media Stock are
    not delivered after the expiration of such rights, warrants or options, the
    Conversion Rate shall be readjusted to the Conversion Rate which would then
    be in effect had the adjustments made upon the record date for the
    determination of stockholders entitled to receive such rights, warrants or
    options been made upon the basis of delivery of only the number of shares
    of Media Stock actually delivered and the amount actually paid therefor.
    In determining whether any rights, warrants or options entitle the holders
    to subscribe for or purchase shares of Media Stock at a price per share
    less than such Current Market Price, there shall be taken into account any
    consideration received by the Corporation upon issuance and upon exercise
    of such rights, warrants or options.  The value of such consideration, if
    other than cash, shall be determined by the good faith business judgment of
    the Board of Directors, whose determination shall be conclusive.

              (c)  If the Corporation shall pay a dividend or make a
    distribution to all holders of outstanding shares of Media Stock, of
    capital stock, cash, evidences of its indebtedness or other assets of the


                                          18

<PAGE>

    Corporation (but excluding (x) any cash dividends or distributions (other
    than Extraordinary Cash Distributions) and (y) dividends or distributions
    referred to in Section 3.6(a)), then the Conversion Rate shall be adjusted
    by multiplying the Conversion Rate in effect immediately prior to the
    opening of business on the record date for the determination of
    stockholders entitled to receive such dividend or distribution by a
    fraction, the numerator of which shall be the Current Market Price
    (determined as of such record date), and the denominator of which shall be
    such Current Market Price less either (A) the fair market value (as
    determined by the good faith business judgment of the Board of Directors,
    whose determination shall be conclusive), as of such record date, of the
    portion of the capital stock, assets or evidences of indebtedness to be so
    distributed applicable to one share of Media Stock or (B), if applicable,
    the amount of the Extraordinary Cash Distribution to be distributed per
    share of Media Stock.  The adjustment pursuant to the foregoing provisions
    of this Section 3.6(c) shall become effective at the opening of business on
    the day next following the record date for the determination of
    stockholders entitled to receive such dividend or distribution.

              (d)  In lieu of making an adjustment to the Conversion Rate
    pursuant to Sections 3.6(a), 3.6(b) or 3.6(c) above for a dividend or
    distribution or an issue of rights, warrants or options, the Corporation
    may distribute out of funds legally available therefor to the holders of
    shares of this Series, or reserve for distribution out of funds legally
    available therefor with each share of Media Stock delivered to a person
    converting a share of this Series pursuant to this Section 3, such dividend
    or distribution or such rights, warrants or options; PROVIDED, HOWEVER,
    that in the case of such a reservation, on the date, if any, on which a
    person converting a share of this Series would no longer be entitled to
    receive such dividend or distribution or receive or exercise such rights,
    warrants or options, such dividend or distribution shall be deemed to have
    occurred, or such rights, warrants or options shall be deemed to have
    issued, and the Conversion Rate shall be adjusted as provided in Section
    3.6(a), 3.6(b) or 3.6(c), as the case may be (with such termination date
    being the relevant date of


                                          19

<PAGE>

    determination for purposes of determining the Current Market Price).

              (e)  The Corporation shall be entitled to make such additional
    increases in the Conversion Rate, in addition to the adjustments required
    by subsections 3.6(a) through 3.6(c), as shall be determined by the Board
    of Directors to be necessary in order that any dividend or distribution in
    Media Stock, any subdivision, reclassification or combination of shares of
    Media Stock or any issuance of rights or warrants referred to above, shall
    not be taxable to the holders of Media Stock for United States Federal
    income tax purposes.

              (f)  To the extent permitted by applicable law, the Corporation
    may from time to time increase the Conversion Rate by any amount for any
    period of time if the period is at least 20 Trading Days, the increase is
    irrevocable during such period and the Board of Directors shall have made a
    determination that such increase would be in the best interests of the
    Corporation, which determination shall be conclusive.

              (g)  In any case in which this Section 3.6 shall require that any
    adjustment be made effective as of or immediately following a record date,
    the Corporation may elect to defer (but only for five (5) Trading Days
    following the occurrence of the event which necessitates the filing of the
    statement referred to in Section 3.9(a)) issuing to the holder of any
    shares of this Series converted after such record date (i) the shares of
    Media Stock and other capital stock of the Corporation issuable upon such
    conversion over and above the shares of Media Stock and other capital stock
    of the Corporation issuable upon such conversion on the basis of the
    Conversion Rate prior to adjustment and (ii) paying to such holder any
    amount in cash in lieu of any fraction thereof pursuant to Section 3.3;
    PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that the Corporation shall deliver to such holder a due
    bill or other appropriate instrument evidencing such holder's right to
    receive such additional shares upon the occurrence of the event requiring
    such adjustment.

              (h)  All calculations under this Section 3 shall be made to the
    nearest cent, one-hundredth of a


                                          20

<PAGE>

    share or, in the case of the Conversion Rate, one hundred-thousandth.
    Notwithstanding any other provision of this Section 3, the Corporation
    shall not be required to make any adjustment of the Conversion Rate unless
    such adjustment would require an increase or decrease of at least 1.00000%
    of such Conversion Rate.  Any lesser adjustment shall be carried forward
    and shall be made at the time of and together with the next subsequent
    adjustment which, together with any adjustment or adjustments so carried
    forward, shall amount to an increase or decrease of at least 1.00000% in
    such rate.  Any adjustments under this Section 3 shall be made successively
    whenever an event requiring such an adjustment occurs.

              (i)  If the Corporation shall take a record of the holders of
    Media Stock for the purpose of entitling them to receive a dividend or
    other distribution, and shall thereafter and before the distribution to
    stockholders thereof legally abandon its plan to pay or deliver such
    dividend or distribution, then thereafter no adjustment in the Conversion
    Rate then in effect shall be required by reason of the taking of such
    record.

              (j)  Subject to Section 3.6(e) hereof, no adjustment shall be
    made pursuant to this Section 3.6 with respect to any share of Series D
    Stock that is converted prior to the time such adjustment otherwise would
    be made.

              3.7  In case of (a) any consolidation or merger to which the
Corporation is a party, other than a merger or consolidation in which the
Corporation is the surviving or continuing corporation and which does not result
in any reclassification of, or change (other than a change in par value or from
par value to no par value or from no par value to par value, or as a result of a
subdivision or combination) in, outstanding shares of Media Stock (or such other
class or series of common stock into which shares of this Series are then
convertible) or (b) any sale or conveyance of all or substantially all of the
property and assets of the Corporation, then lawful provision shall be made as
part of the terms of such transaction whereby the holder of each share of Series
D Stock which is not converted into the right to receive stock or other
securities and property in connection with such


                                          21

<PAGE>

transaction shall have the right thereafter, during the period such share shall
be convertible, to convert such share into the kind and amount of shares of
stock or other securities and property receivable upon such consolidation,
merger, sale or conveyance by a holder of the number of shares of Media Stock
(or such other class or series of common stock into which shares of this Series
are then convertible) into which such shares of this Series could have been
converted immediately prior to such consolidation, merger, sale or conveyance,
subject to adjustment which shall be as nearly equivalent as may be practicable
to the adjustments provided for in this Section 3.  If holders of Media Stock
(or such other class or series of common stock into which shares of this Series
are then convertible) are entitled to elect the kind or amount of securities or
other property receivable upon such consolidation, merger, sale or conveyance,
all adjustments made pursuant to this Section 3.7 shall be based upon (i) the
election, if any, made in writing to the Secretary of the Corporation by the
record holder of the largest number of shares of Series D Stock prior to the
earlier of (x) the last date on which a holder of Media Stock (or such other
class or series of common stock) may make such an election and (y) the date
which is five (5) Trading Days prior to the record date for determining the
holders of Media Stock (or such other class or series of common stock) entitled
to participate in the transaction (or if no such record date is established, the
effective date of such transaction) or (ii) if no such election is timely made,
an assumption that such holder of Media Stock (or such other class or series of
common stock) failed to exercise such rights of election (provided that if the
kind or amount of securities or other property receivable upon such
consolidation, merger, sale or conveyance is not the same for each nonelecting
share, then the kind and amount of securities or other property receivable upon
such consolidation, merger, sale or conveyance for each nonelecting share shall
be deemed to be the kind and amount so receivable per share by a plurality of
the nonelecting shares).  Concurrently with the mailing to holders of Media
Stock (or such other class or series of common stock) of any document pursuant
to which such holders may make an election regarding the kind or amount of
securities or other property that will be receivable by such holder in any
transaction described in clause (a) or (b) of the first sentence of this Section
3.7, the Corporation shall mail a copy thereof to the holders of shares of the
Series D Stock.  The Corporation shall not enter into any of


                                          22

<PAGE>

the transactions referred to in clauses (a) or (b) of the first sentence of this
Section 3.7 unless, prior to the consummation thereof, effective provision shall
be made in a certificate or articles of incorporation or other constituent
document or written instrument of the Corporation or the entity surviving the
consolidation or merger, if other than the Corporation, or the entity acquiring
the Corporation's assets, unless, in either case, such entity is a direct or
indirect subsidiary of another entity, in which case such provision shall be
made in the certificate or articles of incorporation or other constituent
document or written instrument of such other entity (any such entity or other
entity being the "Surviving Entity") so as to assume the obligation to deliver
to each holder of shares of Series D Stock such stock or other securities and
property and otherwise give effect to the provisions set forth in this Section
3.7.  The provisions of this Section 3.7 shall apply similarly to successive
consolidations, mergers, sales or conveyances.

              3.8  After the date, if any, on which all outstanding shares of
Media Stock (or such other class or series of common stock into which shares of
this Series are then convertible) are converted into or exchanged for shares of
another class or series of common stock of the Corporation, each share of this
Series shall thereafter be convertible into or exchangeable for the number of
shares of such other class or series of common stock receivable upon such
conversion or exchange by a holder of that number of shares or fraction thereof
of Media Stock (or such other class or series of common stock into which shares
of this Series are then convertible) into which one share of this Series was
convertible immediately prior to such conversion or exchange.  From and after
any such conversion or exchange, Conversion Rate adjustments as nearly
equivalent as may be practicable to the adjustments pursuant to Sections 3.6 and
3.7 which, prior to such exchange, were made in respect of Media Stock (or such
other class or series of common stock into which shares of this Series are then
convertible) shall instead be made pursuant to such Sections 3.6 and 3.7 in
respect of shares of such other class or series of common stock.

              3.9  Whenever the Conversion Rate is adjusted as provided in this
Section 3, the Corporation (or, in the case of Section 3.7, the Corporation or
the Surviving Entity, as the case may be, shall forthwith place on file


                                          23

<PAGE>

with its transfer agent or agents for this Series a statement signed by a duly
authorized officer of the Corporation or the Surviving Entity, as the case may
be, stating the adjusted Conversion Rate determined as provided herein.  Such
statements shall set forth in reasonable detail such facts as shall be necessary
to show the reason for and the manner of computing such adjustment.  Promptly
after the adjustment of the Conversion Rate, the Corporation or the Surviving
Entity, as the case may be, shall mail a notice thereof to each holder of shares
of this Series.  Whenever the Conversion Rate is increased pursuant to Section
3.6(f), such notice shall be mailed to each holder of shares of this Series as
promptly as possible after the Corporation shall have determined to effect such
increase and, in any event, at least 15 Trading Days prior to the date such
increased Conversion Rate takes effect, and such notice shall state such
increased Conversion Rate and the period during which it will be in effect.
Where appropriate, the notice required by this Section 3.9(a) may be given in
advance and included as part of the notice required pursuant to Section 3.9(b)
or 3.9(c).

              (b)  Subject to the provisions of Section 3.9(c), if: (i) the 
Corporation takes any action that would require an adjustment of the 
Conversion Rate pursuant to Sections 3.6 through 3.8; (ii) there shall be any 
consolidation or merger to which the Corporation is a party and for which 
approval of any stockholders of the Corporation is required, or the sale or 
transfer of all or substantially all of the assets of the Corporation; or 
(iii) there shall occur the voluntary or involuntary liquidation, dissolution 
or winding up of the Corporation, then the Corporation shall, as promptly as 
possible, but at least 10 Trading Days prior to the record date or other date 
set for definitive action if there shall be no record date, a notice stating 
the action or event for which such notice is being given and the record date 
for and the anticipated effective date of such action or event.  Failure to 
give or receive such notice or any defect therein shall not affect the 
legality or validity of the related transaction.

              (c)  If the Corporation intends to convert all of the 
outstanding shares of Media Stock into shares of Communications Stock (or, if 
the Communications Stock is not Publicly Traded at such time and shares of 
any other class or series of common stock of the Corporation (other than 
Media Stock) are then Publicly Traded, of such other class

                                          24

<PAGE>

or series of common stock as has the largest Market Capitalization) (as provided
in Section 2.4 of Article V of the Certificate of Incorporation), then the
Corporation shall, not earlier than the 35th Trading Day and not later than the
45th Trading Day prior to the date of such conversion, cause notice to be filed
with the transfer agent or agents for this Series and given to each record
holder of shares of this Series, setting forth:  (1) a statement that all
outstanding shares of Media Stock shall be converted; (2) the date of such
conversion; (3) the per share number of shares of Communications Stock (or such
other class or series of common stock) to be received with respect to each share
of Media Stock, including details as to the calculation thereof; (4) the place
or places where certificates for shares of Media Stock, properly endorsed or
assigned for transfer (unless the Corporation shall waive such requirement), are
to be surrendered for delivery of certificates for shares of Communications
Stock (or such other class or series of common stock); (5) the number of shares
of Media Stock outstanding and the number of shares of Media Stock into or for
which outstanding Convertible Securities are then convertible, exchangeable or
exercisable and the conversion, exchange or exercise price thereof, including
the number of outstanding shares of this Series and the Conversion Price; (6) a
statement to the effect that, subject to Section 2.4.5(I) of Article V of the
Certificate of Incorporation, dividends on shares of such Media Stock shall
cease to be paid as of the date of such conversion; (7) that a holder of shares
of this Series shall be entitled to receive shares of Communications Stock (or
such other class or series of common stock) pursuant to such conversion if such
holder converts shares of this Series on or prior to the date of such
conversion; and (8) a statement as to what such holder will be entitled to
receive pursuant to the terms of Section 3.8 if such holder thereafter properly
converts shares of this Series.  In addition, from and after any conversion of
Media Stock effected in accordance with Section 2.4 of Article V of the
Certificate of Incorporation, if (x) a class or series of common stock of the
Corporation exists in addition to the class or series of common stock into which
the Media Stock was converted and (y) the Corporation intends to convert the
class or series of common stock into which the Media Stock was converted into
another such class or series of common stock of the Corporation, then the
Corporation shall give notice comparable to the notice described in the
preceding  sentence of its intention to effect such a conversion.    In


                                          25

<PAGE>

the event of any conflict between the notice provisions of this Section 3.9(c)
and Section 3.9(b), the notice provisions of this Section 3.9(c) shall govern.

              3.10  There shall be no adjustment of the Conversion Rate in case
of the issuance of any stock of the Corporation in a reorganization, acquisition
or other similar transaction except as specifically set forth in this Section 3.
If any action or transaction would require adjustment of any Conversion Rate
established hereunder pursuant to more than one paragraph of this Section 3,
only the adjustment which would result in the largest increase of such
Conversion Rate shall be made.

              3.11  The Corporation shall at all times reserve and keep
available, free from preemptive rights, out of its authorized but unissued
stock, for the purpose of effecting the conversion of the shares of this Series,
such number of its duly authorized shares of Media Stock (or, if applicable, any
other shares of Capital Stock of the Corporation) as shall from time to time be
sufficient to effect the conversion of all outstanding shares of this Series
into such Media Stock (or such other shares of Capital Stock) at any time;
PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that nothing contained herein shall preclude the Corporation
from satisfying its obligations in respect of the conversion of the shares by
delivery of purchased shares of Media Stock (or such other shares of Capital
Stock) that are held in the treasury of the Corporation.  All shares of Media
Stock (or such other shares of Capital Stock of the Corporation) which shall be
deliverable upon conversion of the shares of this Series shall be duly and
validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable.  For purposes of this Section 3,
the number    of shares of Media Stock or any other class or series of common
stock of the Corporation at any time outstanding shall not include any shares of
Media Stock or such other class or series of common stock then owned or held by
or for the account of Corporation or any subsidiary of the Corporation.

              3.12  If any shares of Media Stock (or such other class or series
of common stock into which shares of this Series are then convertible) which
would be issuable upon conversion of shares of this Series hereunder require
registration with or approval of any governmental authority before such shares
may be issued upon conversion, the Corporation will in good faith and as
expeditiously as


                                          26

<PAGE>

possible cause such shares to be duly registered or approved, as the case may
be.  The Corporation will endeavor to list the shares of (or depositary shares
representing fractional interests in) Media Stock (or such other class or series
of common stock into which shares of this Series are then convertible) required
to be delivered upon conversion of shares of this Series prior to such delivery
upon the principal national securities exchange upon which the outstanding Media
Stock (or such other class or series of common stock) is listed at the time of
such delivery.

              3.13  The Corporation shall pay any and all issue, stamp,
documentation, transfer or other taxes that may be payable in respect of any
issue or delivery of shares of Media Stock (or such other class or series of
common stock into which shares of this Series are then convertible) on
conversion of shares of this Series pursuant hereto.  The Corporation shall not,
however, be required to pay any tax which is payable in respect of any transfer
involved in the issue or delivery of Media Stock (or such other class or series
of common stock) in a name other than that in which the shares of this Series so
converted were registered, and no such issue or delivery shall be made unless
and until the Person requesting such issue has paid to the Corporation the
amount of such tax, or has established, to the satisfaction of the Corporation,
that such tax has been paid.

         4.   REDEMPTION OR EXCHANGE.
              4.1  (a)  Except as provided in Section 4.1(b), the shares of
this Series shall not be redeemable by the Corporation prior to the third
anniversary of the Effective Time.  The Corporation may, at its sole option,
subject to Section 2.2 hereof, from time to time on and after the third
anniversary of the Effective Time and prior to the fifth anniversary of the
Effective Time, exchange shares of Media Stock (or such other class or series of
common stock into which shares of this Series are then convertible) for all or
any part of the outstanding shares of this Series at the Exchange Rate;
PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that such an exchange may only be effected if the Closing
Price shall be greater than the product of (x) the Conversion Price multiplied
by (y) 1.35, on 20 of the 30 Trading Days immediately prior to the date of the
notice delivered by the Corporation pursuant to Section 4.3(a) to holders of
shares of this Series to be exchanged.  The Corporation may, at its sole option,
subject to Section 2.2 hereof, from time to


                                          27

<PAGE>

time on and after the fifth anniversary of the Effective Time, at its election
either:  (i) redeem, out of funds legally available therefor, all or any part of
the outstanding shares of this Series at the Redemption Price; (ii) exchange
shares of Media Stock (or such other class or series of common stock into which
shares of this Series are then convertible) for all or any part of the
outstanding shares of this Series at the Exchange Rate; or (iii) effect a
combination of the options described in the foregoing clauses (i) and (ii) (in
which event each holder of shares of this Series which are selected for
redemption and exchange pursuant to Section 4.2 shall receive the same
proportion of cash and shares of Media Stock (or such other class or series of
common stock into which shares of this Series are then convertible) (except for
cash paid in lieu of fractional shares) paid to other holders of shares of this
Series selected for redemption and exchange).

              (b)  The Corporation shall redeem, out of funds legally available
therefor, all of the outstanding shares of this Series, at the Redemption Price,
if any of the following events with respect to the Media Group occur (such
events being collectively referred to herein as the "Media Group Special
Events"):

              (i)  (A)  the Corporation redeems all of the outstanding shares
    of Media Stock in exchange for shares of common stock of the Media Group
    Subsidiaries as provided in Section 2.4.3 of Article V of the Certificate
    of Incorporation (the "Media Group Subsidiary Redemption") or (B) following
    a Disposition of all or substantially all of the properties and assets
    attributed to the Media Group, the Corporation either (1) pays a dividend
    on the Media Stock in an amount equal to the product of the Outstanding
    Media Fraction multiplied by the Fair Value of the Net Proceeds of such
    Disposition as provided in Section 2.4.1(A)(1)(a) of Article V of the
    Certificate of Incorporation (the "Media Group Disposition Dividend"), or
    (2) redeems shares of Media Stock for an amount equal to the product of the
    Outstanding Media Fraction multiplied by the Fair Value of the Net Proceeds
    of such Disposition as provided in Section 2.4.1(A)(1)(b) of Article V of
    the Certificate of Incorporation (the "Media Group Disposition
    Redemption"); or


                                          28

<PAGE>

              (ii) the Corporation pays a dividend on, or the Corporation or
    any of its subsidiaries consummates a tender offer or exchange offer for,
    shares of Media Stock and the aggregate amount of such dividend or the
    consideration paid in such tender offer or exchange offer is an amount
    equal to the Fair Value of all or substantially all of the properties and
    assets attributed to the Media Group (the "Media Group Special Dividend" or
    the "Media Group Tender or Exchange Offer", respectively); PROVIDED,
    HOWEVER, that the calculation of the Fair Value of all or substantially all
    of the properties and assets attributed to the Media Group shall be made
    without giving effect to any money borrowed by the Corporation or any of
    its subsidiaries in connection with such dividend or tender offer or
    exchange offer, as the case may be.

The Redemption Date for shares of this Series to be redeemed by the Corporation
pursuant to this Section 4.1(b) shall be, if the applicable Media Group Special
Event is (I) the Media Group Subsidiary Redemption, the date of such exchange,
(II) the Media Group Disposition Dividend or the Media Group Special Dividend,
the date of payment of such dividend, (III) the Media Group Disposition
Redemption, the date of such redemption or (IV) the Media Group Tender or
Exchange Offer, the date such tender offer or exchange offer is consummated.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Section 4.1(b), any
redemption pursuant to this Section 4.1(b) shall be conditioned upon the actual
redemption of Media Stock for shares of common stock of the Media Group
Subsidiaries, payment of the Media Group Disposition Dividend or the amount due
as a result of the Media Group Disposition Redemption (in each case in the
required kind of capital stock, cash, securities and/or other property), payment
of the Media Group Special Dividend or the consummation of the Media Group
Tender or Exchange Offer, as the case may be.

              (c)  The Corporation shall, on the twentieth anniversary of the
Effective Time, at its election either:  (i) redeem, out of funds legally
available therefor, all of the outstanding shares of this Series at the
Redemption Price; (ii) exchange shares of Media Stock (or such other class or
series of common stock into which shares of this Series are then convertible)
for all of the outstanding shares of this Series at the Exchange Rate; or (iii)
effect a combination of the options described in the foregoing


                                          29

<PAGE>

clauses (i) and (ii) (in which event each holder of shares of this Series shall
receive the same proportion of cash and shares of Media Stock (or such other
class or series of common stock into which shares of this Series are then
convertible) (except for cash paid in lieu of fractional shares) paid to other
holders of shares of this Series).

              (d)  The Corporation shall redeem, out of funds legally available
therefore, all of the outstanding shares of this Series at the Redemption Price,
if (i) the Corporation converts all of the outstanding shares of Media Stock
into shares of Communications Stock (or, if the Communications Stock is not
Publicly Traded at such time and shares of any other class or series of common
stock of the Corporation (other than Media Stock) are then Publicly Traded, of
such other class or series of common stock as has the largest Market
Capitalization) as provided in Section 2.4 of Article V of the Certificate of
Incorporation and (ii) at any time following such conversion (A) an event
substantially similar to any Media Group Special Event occurs in respect to the
Communications Stock (or such other class or series of common stock) and (B) at
the time of such event shares of another class or series of common stock of the
Corporation (other then Communications Stock or such other class or series of
common stock) are then Publicly Traded.  The Redemption Date for, and the
conditions to, any such redemption shall be determined in a manner consistent
with the Redemption Date and conditions set forth in Section 4.1(b) for a
redemption resulting from a substantially similar Media Group Special Event.

              (e)  The Corporation shall be entitled to effect an exchange of
shares of Media Stock (or such other class or series of common stock into which
shares of this Series are then convertible) for shares of Series D Stock
pursuant to Section 4.1(a) or 4.1(c) only to the extent Media Stock (or such
other class or series of common stock) shall be available for issuance
(including delivery of previously issued shares of Media Stock (or such other
class or series) held in the Corporation's treasury on the Redemption Date).
The Corporation may, but shall not be required to, in connection with any
exchange of shares of this Series pursuant to Section 4.1(a) or 4.1(c), issue a
fraction of a share of Media Stock (or such other class or series of common
stock into which shares of this Series are then convertible), and if the
Corporation shall determine not to issue any such fraction, the Corporation
shall make a


                                          30

<PAGE>

cash payment (rounded to the nearest cent) equal to such fraction multiplied by
the Closing Price of the Media Stock (or such other class or series of common
stock) on the last Trading Day prior to the Redemption Date.

              4.2  In the event that fewer than all of the outstanding shares
of this Series are to be redeemed and/or exchanged pursuant to Section 4.1(a),
subject to clause (iii) of the third sentence of Section 4.1(a), the aggregate
number of shares of this Series held by each holder which will be redeemed
and/or exchanged shall be determined by the Corporation by lot or pro rata or by
any other method as may be determined by the Board of Directors in its sole

without interest and, in the case of an exchange, the right to receive from the
Corporation the Exchange Rate without interest) shall cease (including any right
to receive dividends otherwise payable on any Dividend Payment Date that would

                                          38

case of a redemption, defaults in the payment of the Redemption Price and, in

of an exchange, certificates representing the shares of Media Stock to be
exchanged on the Redemption Date, in trust, with irrevocable instructions that
such money or shares be applied to the redemption or exchange of shares of this
Series so called for redemption or exchange.  Any money or certificates so

so redeemed or exchanged (properly endorsed or assigned for transfer, if the
Corporation shall so require and the notice of redemption or exchange shall so
state), such shares shall be redeemed by the Corporation at the Redemption Price
or exchanged by the Corporation at the Exchange Rate, as applicable (unless, in
the case of a redemption or exchange pursuant to Section 4.1(a), the Corporation
shall have exercised its right to rescind such redemption or exchange pursuant
to Section 4.5 or, in the case of a redemption pursuant to Section 4.1(b) or
4.1(d), the conditions to such redemption shall not have been satisfied).  In
case fewer than all the shares represented by any such certificate are to be
redeemed or exchanged, a new certificate shall be issued representing the
unredeemed and unexchanged shares (or fractions thereof as provided in Section
7.4), without cost to the holder thereof.  Subject to applicable escheat laws,
any moneys or shares so set aside by the Corporation and unclaimed at the end of
two years from the Redemption Date shall revert to


                                          39

<PAGE>

the general funds of the Corporation, after which reversion the holders of such
shares so called for redemption or exchange shall look only to the Corporation
for the payment of the Redemption Price or the Exchange Rate, as the case may
be, without interest.  Any interest accrued on any funds so deposited shall be
paid to the Corporation from time to time.

              4.5  If notice of redemption or exchange pursuant to Section
4.1(a) shall have been given by the Corporation pursuant to Section 4.3(a), in
the event that a Redemption Rescission Event shall occur following the date of
such notice but at or prior to the Redemption Date, the Corporation may, at its
sole option, at any time prior to the earlier of (i) the close of business on
that day which is five (5) Trading Days following such Redemption Rescission
Event and (ii) the Redemption Date, rescind such redemption or exchange by
making a public announcement of such rescission (the date on which such public
announcement shall have been made being hereinafter referred to as the
"Rescission Date").  The Corporation shall be deemed to have made such
announcement if it shall issue a release to the Dow Jones News Service and
Reuters Information Services or any successor news wire service.  From and after
the making of such announcement, the Corporation shall have no obligation to
effect such redemption or exchange or to pay the Redemption Price or Exchange
Rate therefor and all rights of holders of shares of this Series shall be
restored as if notice of redemption or exchange had not been given.  The
Corporation shall give notice of any such rescission by first-class mail,
postage prepaid, mailed as promptly as practicable, but in no event later than
the close of business on that date which is five (5) Trading Days following the
Rescission Date to each record holder of shares of this Series at the close of
business on the Rescission Date and to any other Person or entity that was a
record holder of shares of this Series and that shall have surrendered shares of
this Series for conversion following the giving of notice of the subsequently
rescinded redemption or exchange.  Each notice of rescission shall (w) state
that such redemption or exchange has been rescinded, (x) state that any
Converting Holder shall be entitled to rescind the conversion of shares of this
Series surrendered for conversion following the day on which notice of such
redemption or exchange was given but on or prior to the later of (I) the close
of business on the Trading Day next succeeding the date on which public
announcement of the


                                          40

<PAGE>

rescission of such redemption or exchange shall have been made and (II) the date
which is three Trading Days following the mailing of the Corporation's notice of
rescission, (y) be accompanied by a form prescribed by the Corporation to be
used by any Converting Holder rescinding the conversion of shares so surrendered
for conversion (and instructions for the completion and delivery of such form,
including instructions with respect to payments that may be required to
accompany such delivery in accordance with Section 3.5) and (z) state that such
form must be properly completed and received by the Corporation no later than
the close of business on a date that shall be fifteen (15) Trading Days
following the date of the mailing of such notice of rescission.

Certificate or the Certificate of Incorporation, so as in any such case to
materially and adversely affect the voting powers, designations, preferences and

limitations or restrictions of the shares of this Series; PROVIDED, HOWEVER,
that an amendment which effects a split of this Series or which effects a
combination of the shares of this Series into a fewer number of Shares shall not
be deemed to have any such material adverse effect.

              (b)  No vote or consent of holders of shares of this Series shall
be required for (i) the creation of any indebtedness of any kind of the
Corporation, (ii) the authorization or issuance of any class of Junior Stock

              5.2  (a)  If and whenever at any time or times dividends payable
on shares of this Series shall have been in arrears and unpaid in an aggregate
amount equal to or exceeding the amount of dividends payable thereon for six
quarterly dividend periods, then the number of directors constituting the Board
of Directors shall be automatically increased by two and the holders of shares
of this Series, together with the holders of any shares of any Parity Stock as
to which in each case dividends are in arrears and unpaid in an aggregate amount
equal to or exceeding the amount of dividends payable thereon for six quarterly
dividend periods, shall have the exclusive right, voting separately as a class
with such other series, to elect two directors of the Corporation.

              (b)  Such voting right may be exercised initially either by
written consent or at a special meeting of the holders of the Preferred Stock
having such voting right, called as hereinafter provided, or at any annual
meeting of stockholders held for the purpose of electing directors, and
thereafter at each such annual meeting until such time as all dividends in
arrears on the shares of this Series shall have been paid in full and all
dividends payable on the shares of this Series on four subsequent consecutive
Dividend Payment Dates shall have been paid in full on such dates or funds shall
have been set aside for the payment thereof, at which time such voting right and
the term of the directors elected pursuant to Section 5.2(a) shall terminate.

              (c)  At any time when such voting right shall have vested in
holders of shares of such series of Preferred Stock described in Section 5.2(b),
and if such right shall not already have been exercised by written consent, a
proper officer of the Corporation may call, and, upon the written request,
addressed to the Secretary of the Corporation, of the record holders of either
(i) shares representing twenty-five percent (25%) of the voting power of the
shares then outstanding of the Series D Stock or (ii) shares representing
twenty-five percent (25%) of the voting power of shares of all series of
Preferred Stock having such voting right, shall call, a special meeting of the

annual meetings of stockholders of the Corporation, or, if none, at a place

Section 5.2(c), no such special meeting shall be called during a period within
60 days immediately preceding the date fixed for the next annual meeting of
stockholders.

              (d)  At any meeting held for the purpose of electing directors at

directors as provided herein, the presence in person or by proxy of the holders
of shares representing more than fifty percent (50%) in voting power of the then
outstanding shares of such Preferred Stock having such right shall be required
and shall be sufficient to constitute a quorum of such class for the election of
directors by such class.

              (e)  Any director elected by holders of Preferred Stock pursuant
to the voting right created under this Section 5.2 shall hold office until the
next annual meeting of stockholders (unless such term has previously terminated
pursuant to Section 5.2(b)) and any vacancy in respect of any such director
shall be filled only by vote of the remaining director so elected, or if there
be no such remaining director, by the holders of such Preferred Stock entitled
to elect such director or directors by written consent or at a special meeting
called in accordance with the procedures set forth in Section 5.2(c), or, if no
special meeting is called or written consent executed, at the next annual
meeting of stockholders.

                              [Form of Affiliate Letter]

U S WEST, Inc.
7800 East Orchard Road
Englewood, Colorado  80111

Ladies and Gentlemen:

         I have been advised that as of the date of this letter I may be deemed
to be an "affiliate" of Continental Cablevision, Inc., a Delaware corporation
(the "Company"), as such term is (i) defined for purposes of paragraphs (c) and
(d) of Rule 145 of the rules and regulations (the "Rules and Regulations") of
the Securities and Exchange Commission (the "Commission") under the Securities
Act of 1933, as amended (the "Securities Act"), or (ii) used in and for purposes
of Accounting Series Releases 130 and 135, as amended, of the Commission.
Pursuant to the terms of the Agreement and Plan of Merger, dated as of February
27, 1996 (as amended from time to time, the "Merger Agreement"), between U S
WEST, Inc., a Delaware corporation ("Acquiror"), and the Company, the Company
will be merged with and into Acquiror (the "Merger"), with Acquiror continuing
as the surviving corporation.

         Pursuant to the Merger, each share of Class A Common Stock, par value
$.01 per share, of the Company owned by me, if any, and each share of Class B
Common Stock, par value $.01 per share, of the Company ("Class B Common Stock")
owned by me will be converted into the right to receive, at my election, either
(i) cash (in the case of shares of Class B Common Stock only) or (ii) shares of
U S WEST Media Group Common Stock, par value $.01 per share, of Acquiror (the
"Media Stock") and shares of Series D Convertible Preferred Stock, par value
$1.00 per share, of Acquiror (the "Series D Preferred Stock").

<PAGE>

         I represent, warrant and covenant to Acquiror that, with respect
to all Media Stock and Series D Preferred Stock received by me as a result of
the Merger:

         1.   I shall not make any sale, transfer or other disposition of Media
Stock or Series D Preferred Stock in violation of the Securities Act or the
Rules and Regulations.

         2.   I have carefully read this letter and the Merger Agreement and
discussed the requirements of such documents and any other applicable
limitations upon my ability to sell, transfer or otherwise dispose of Media
Stock or Series D Preferred Stock to the extent I felt necessary, with my
counsel or counsel for the Company.

         3.   I have been advised that the issuance of Media Stock and Series D
Preferred Stock to me pursuant to the Merger has been registered with the
Commission under the Securities Act.  However, I have also been advised that,
since at the time the Merger Agreement was submitted for a vote of the
stockholders of the Company, I may be deemed to have been an "affiliate" of the
Company and the distribution by me of Media Stock and Series D Preferred Stock
has not been registered under the Act, I may not sell, transfer or otherwise
dispose of Media Stock and Series D Preferred Stock issued to me in the Merger
unless (i) such sale, transfer or other disposition has been registered under
the Securities Act or is made in conformity with Rule 145 under the Securities
Act, or (ii) in the opinion of counsel reasonably acceptable to Acquiror, or
pursuant to a "no action" letter obtained by me from the staff of the
Commission, such sale, transfer or other disposition is otherwise exempt from
registration under the Securities Act.

         4.   I understand, that, except as may be provided in a registration
rights agreement, if any, to be entered into by Acquiror and me as contemplated
by the Merger Agreement, Acquiror is under no obligation to register under the
Securities Act the sale, transfer or other disposition of Media Stock or
Series D Preferred Stock by me or on my behalf or to take any other action
necessary in order to make compliance with an exemption from such registration
available.

         5.   I understand that Acquiror will give stop transfer instructions
to Acquiror's transfer agents with respect to the Media Stock and Series D
Preferred Stock and

                                          2

<PAGE>

that the certificates for the Media Stock and Series D Preferred Stock issued to
me, or any substitutions therefor, will bear a legend substantial to the
following effect:

    "THE SECURITIES REPRESENTED BY THIS CERTIFICATE WERE ISSUED IN A
    TRANSACTION TO WHICH RULE 145 PROMULGATED UNDER THE SECURITIES ACT OF 1933
    APPLIES.  THE SECURITIES REPRESENTED BY THIS CERTIFICATE MAY ONLY BE
    TRANSFERRED IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE TERMS OF AN AGREEMENT, DATED _________
    __, 1996, BETWEEN THE REGISTERED HOLDER HEREOF AND U S WEST, INC., A COPY
    OF WHICH AGREEMENT IS ON FILE AT THE PRINCIPAL OFFICES OF U S WEST, INC."

         6.   I also understand that unless the transfer by me of my Media
Stock or Series D Preferred Stock has been registered under the Securities Act
or is a sale made in conformity with the provisions of Rule 145, Acquiror
reserves the right to place the following legend on the certificates issued to
any transferee:

    "THE SECURITIES REPRESENTED BY THIS CERTIFICATE HAVE NOT BEEN REGISTERED
    UNDER THE SECURITIES ACT OF 1933 AND WERE ACQUIRED FROM A PERSON WHO
    RECEIVED SUCH SECURITIES IN A TRANSACTION TO WHICH RULE 145 PROMULGATED
    UNDER THE SECURITIES ACT OF 1933 APPLIES.  THE SECURITIES HAVE NOT BEEN
    ACQUIRED BY THE HOLDER WITH A VIEW TO, OR FOR RESALE IN CONNECTION WITH,
    ANY DISTRIBUTION THEREOF WITHIN THE MEANING OF THE SECURITIES ACT OF 1933
    AND MAY NOT BE SOLD, TRANSFERRED OR OTHERWISE DISPOSED OF EXCEPT PURSUANT
    TO AN EFFECTIVE REGISTRATION STATEMENT OR IN ACCORDANCE WITH AN EXEMPTION
    FROM THE REGISTRATION REQUIREMENTS OF THE SECURITIES ACT OF 1933."

         It is understood and agreed that the legends set forth in paragraphs 5
and 6 above shall be removed by delivery of substitute certificates without such
legend if such legend is not required for purposes of the Securities Act.  It is
understood and agreed that such legends and the stop orders referred to above
will be removed if (i) two years shall have elapsed from the date I acquired
Media Stock and Series D Preferred Stock received in the Merger and the
provisions of Rule 145(d)(2) are then available to me, (ii) three years shall
have elapsed from the date I acquired Media Stock and Series D Preferred Stock
received in the Merger and the provisions of Rule 145(d)(3) are then available
to me, or (iii) Acquiror has received either an



                                          3

<PAGE>

opinion of counsel, which opinion and counsel shall be reasonably satisfactory
to Acquiror, or a "no-action" letter obtained by me from the staff of the
Commission, to the effect that the restrictions imposed by Rule 145 under the
Securities Act no longer apply to me.

         Execution of this letter should not be considered an admission on my
part that I am an "affiliate" of the Company as described in the first paragraph
of this letter  or as a waiver of any rights that I may have to object to any
claim that I am such an affiliate on or after the date of this letter.

                             Sincerely,



                             ______________________________

         Pursuant to Section 151 of the General Corporation Law of the State of
Delaware, Continental Cablevision, Inc. (the "Corporation"), a corporation
organized and existing under the General Corporation Law of the State of
Delaware, in accordance with the provisions of Section 103 thereof, DOES HEREBY

         That pursuant to the authority conferred upon the Board of Directors
of the Corporation by Article FOURTH of the Restated Certificate of
Incorporation of the Corporation (as in effect on the date hereof and as amended
from time to time in accordance with its terms, the "Restated Certificate of
Incorporation"), and in accordance with the provisions of Section 151 of the

of Preferred Stock designated as Series B Convertible Preferred Stock:

         RESOLVED that, pursuant to the authority vested in the Board of
Directors of the Corporation in accordance with the provisions of the Restated
Certificate of Incorporation, a series of the class of authorized Preferred
Stock, par value $.01 per share, of the Corporation is hereby created and that
the designation and number of shares thereof and the voting powers, preferences
and relative, participating, optional and other special rights of the shares of
such series, and the qualifications, limitations and restrictions thereof are as
follows:

         Section 1.  DESIGNATION AND NUMBER.
(a)  The shares of such series shall be designated as "Series B Convertible
Preferred Stock" (the "Series B Preferred Stock" or "this Series").  The number
of shares initially constituting the Series B Preferred Stock shall be
5,650,000, which

<PAGE>

number may be decreased (but not increased) by the Board of Directors without a
vote of stockholders; PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that such number may not be decreased

Notwithstanding any other provision in this Certificate of Designation, the
Corporation shall not be required to issue fractional shares of the Series B
Preferred Stock.

         Section 2.  RANKING.  The Series B Preferred Stock shall, with respect
to dividend rights and rights on liquidation, dissolution or winding up, rank
pari passu with the Series A Preferred Stock and prior to or pari passu with all

preferred stock that is not convertible into or exchangeable for any class or
series of the Corporation's equity securities or for any other property,
including without limitation securities other than the Corporation's equity
securities referred to herein) and prior to all classes of the Common Stock, par
value $.01 per share, of the Corporation (the "Common Stock").

         Section 3.  DIVIDENDS AND DISTRIBUTIONS.
(a)  The holders of shares of Series B Preferred Stock shall be entitled to
receive as and when declared by the Board of Directors out of funds legally
available therefor, cash dividends at the rate (the "Dividend Rate") of________
________ percent (_____%) per annum (1),____________________________.

(1)      The Dividend Rate shall be subject to an adjustment such that the
final Dividend Rate equals the sum of 5.875%, (the "Based Dividend Rate") plus
the Adjustment Amount (as defined below).

         The Base Dividend Rate shall be subject to adjustment in the following
manner:

         (i)  If the Adjustment Amount is less than seven basis points in
absolute terms, then the Adjustment Amount shall be deemed to be zero and the
Dividend Rate shall equal the Base Dividend Rate.

                                                 (Cont'd on following page)

                                          2

<PAGE>

____________________________
(Cont'd from preceding page)

         (ii) If the Adjustment Amount is greater than or equal to seven basis
points in absolute terms, then the Dividend Rate shall be equal to the Base
Dividend Rate plus the Adjustment Amount (whether positive or negative), rounded
to the nearest multiple of 0.125%.

         "Adjustment Amount" shall be equal to the product of (x) the sum of
(1) the Change In Weighted Average Yield plus (2) the Credit Spread multiplied
by (y) the Discount Factor.

         "Average Credit Spread"  shall be equal to the average of the
difference between the closing bid-side yield of the Corporation's 8.30% senior
unsecured notes due 2006 and the 10-year Treasury yield, calculated for each of
the 10 Trading Days after announcement of the termination of the transactons
contemplated by the Merger Agreement (as defined in Section 12).

         "Change in Weighted Average Yield" shall equal the sum (whether
positive or negitive) of the folowing, based upon the average market closing
levels of Treasury securities for the 10 Trading Days after announcement of the
termination of the transactons contemplated by the Merger Agreement:

         (i)  the change (whether positive or negative) since February 27, 1996
in basis points in 3-year Treasury yields x 0.25;

         (ii) the change (whether positive or negative) since February 27, 1996
in basis points in 5-year Treasury yields x 0.25;

         (iii) the change (whether positive or negative) since February 27,
1996 in basis points in 10-year Treasury yields x 0.25; and

         (iv)  the change (whether positive or negative) since February 27,
1996 in basis points in 20-year Treasury yields x 0.25.

                                                 (Cont'd on following page)

                                          3

<PAGE>

through and including the date on which such Series B Preferred Stock is no
longer issued and outstanding, which dividends shall be payable in equal
quarterly installments on________,_________,________and_______each year (each
such date, regardless of whether any dividends have been paid or declared and
set aside for payment on such date, being a "Dividend Payment Date") to holders
of record as they appear on the stock books on such record dates as are fixed by
the Board of Directors, but only when, as and if declared by the Board of
Directors out of funds at the time legally available for the payment of
dividends.  For purposes of calculation of such cash dividends, the Series B
Preferred Stock shall be valued at the Stated Value (as defined in Section 12).
Such dividends shall begin to accrue on outstanding shares of Series B Preferred
Stock from the date of issuance and shall be deemed to accrue from day to day
whether or not earned or declared until paid; PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that dividends
accrued or deemed to have accrued for any period shorter than the full three-
month period between Dividend Payment

____________________________
(Cont'd from preceding page)

         "Credit Spread" shall equal the difference between (A) the product of
1.87234 multiplied by the Average Credit Spread minus (B) 440 basis points.

                      "Discount Factor" shall equal 0.55.

For example, if (i) the Base Dividend Rate is 5.875%, (ii) the average 3-year
Treasury, 5-Year Treasury, 10-year Treasury and 20-Year Treasury yields are each
20 basis points lower at closing than they are currently and (iii) the Average
Credit Spread is 260 basis points, the Credit Spread would be equal to 47 basis
points ((260 x 1.87234) - 440).  The resulting Adjustment Amount would be equal
to 14.85 basis points ((-20 + 47) x 0.55).  Because such Adjustment Amount is
greater than seven basis points, the Dividend Rate would be equal to the Base
Dividend Rate plus the Adjustment Amount of (6.0235%), rounded to the yield
which is at the nearest multiple of 0.125% (or 6.00%).

                                          4

<PAGE>

Dates shall be computed based on the actual number of days elapsed in the three-
month period for which such dividends are payable.  Dividends on the Series B
Preferred Stock shall be cumulative.  The Dividend Rate per share of Series B
Preferred Stock shall be appropriately adjusted from time to time to reflect any
split or combination of the shares of the Series B Preferred Stock.

         (b)  No dividends or other distributions, other than dividends or
other distributions payable solely in shares of capital stock ranking junior
(both as to dividends and upon liquidation, dissolution or winding up) to the
Series B Preferred Stock (or cash in lieu of fractional shares with respect to
such dividends or distributions) and liquidating distributions which are subject
to the provisions of Section 8 hereof, shall be paid or set aside for payment
on, and no purchase, redemption or other acquisition shall be made of, any
shares of capital stock of the Corporation (other than any class or series of
Preferred Stock that, in accordance with Section 2 hereof, (i) ranks senior to
the Series B Preferred Stock or (ii) is Parity Stock (as defined in Section 12),
so long as any dividend payments per share on Parity Stock as a percentage of
accrued and unpaid dividends per share on Parity Stock do not exceed
contemporaneous dividend payments per share on the Series B Preferred Stock as a
percentage of accrued and unpaid dividends per share on the Series B Preferred
Stock), unless and until all accrued and unpaid dividends on the Series B
Preferred Stock for any prior quarterly dividend period shall have been declared
and paid or a sum sufficient for the payment thereof set aside for such
purposes.  No interest, or sum of money in lieu of interest, shall be payable in
respect of any dividend payment or payments on the Series B Preferred Stock
which may be in arrears.

         (c)  Any reference to "distribution" contained in this Section 3 shall
not be deemed to include any stock dividend or distributions made in connection
with any liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the Corporation, whether
voluntary or involuntary.

                                          5

entitled to receive any dividends or other distributions with respect to such
shares except as provided herein.

         Section 4.  VOTING.  (a)  The holders of record of shares of Series B
Preferred Stock shall have no voting rights except as required by law or as set
forth below; PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that the rights set forth in Section 4(c) hereof
may be exercised only to the extent that such exercise would not result in a
Legal Prohibition or any violation of applicable law or regulation.

              (b)  (i)  So long as any shares of Series B Preferred Stock
remain outstanding, unless a greater percentage shall then be required by law,
the Corporation shall not, without the affirmative vote at a meeting or the
written consent with or representing at least 51% of the shares of Series B
Preferred Stock then outstanding (A) authorize any Senior Stock or reclassify
any Junior Stock or Parity Stock as Senior Stock or (B) amend, alter or repeal
any of the provisions of the Certificate or the Restated Certificate of
Incorporation, so as in any such case to materially and adversely affect the
voting powers, designations, preferences and relative, participating, optional
or other special rights, and qualifications, limitations or restrictions of the
Series B Preferred Stock; PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that an amendment which effects a
split of Series B Preferred Stock or which effects a combination of the shares
of Series B Preferred Stock into a fewer number of shares shall not be deemed to
have any such material adverse effect.

                   (ii)  No vote or consent of holders of shares of Series B
Preferred Stock shall be required for (A) the creation of any indebtedness of
any kind of the Corporation, (B) the authorization or issuance of any class of
Junior Stock (including any class or series of common stock of the Corporation)
or Parity Stock, (C) the authorization, designation or issuance of additional
shares of Series B Preferred Stock  or (D) subject to Section 4(b)(i), the
authorization or issuance of any other shares of Preferred Stock.

              (c)  (i)  If and whenever at any time or times dividends payable
on shares of this Series shall have been in arrears and unpaid in an aggregate
amount equal to or exceeding the amount of dividends payable thereon for six
quarterly dividend periods, then the number of directors

                                          6

<PAGE>

constituting the Board of Directors shall be automatically increased by two and
the holders of shares of Series B Preferred Stock, together with the holders of
any shares of any Parity Stock as to which in each case dividends are in arrears
and unpaid in an aggregate amount equal to or exceeding the amount of dividends
payable thereon for six quarterly dividend periods, shall have the exclusive
right, voting separately as a class with the holders of any such Parity Stock,
to elect two directors of the Corporation.

                   (ii)  Such voting right may be exercised initially either by
written consent or at a special meeting of the holders of Preferred Stock having
such voting right, called as hereinafter provided, or at any annual meeting of
stockholders held for the purpose of electing directors, and thereafter at each
such annual meeting until such time as all dividends in arrears on the shares of
this Series shall have been paid in full and all dividends payable on the shares
on this Series on four subsequent consecutive Dividend Payment Dates shall have
been paid in full on such dates or funds shall have been set aside for the
payment thereof, at which time such voting right and the term of the directors
elected pursuant to Section 4(c)(i) shall terminate.

                   (iii)  At any time when such voting right shall have vested
in holders of shares of such series of Preferred Stock described in Section
4(c)(ii), and if such right shall not already have been exercised by written
consent, a proper officer of the Corporation may call, and, upon the written
request, addressed to the Secretary of the Corporation, of the record holders of
either (A) shares representing twenty-five percent (25%) of the voting power of
the shares then outstanding of Series B Preferred Stock or (B) shares
representing twenty-five percent (25%) of the voting power of shares of all
series of Preferred Stock having such voting right, shall call, a special
meeting of the holders of all such series of Preferred Stock having such voting
right.  Such meeting shall be held at the earliest practicable date upon the
notice required for annual meetings of stockholders at the place for holding
annual meetings of stockholders of the Corporation, or, if none, at a place
designated by the Board of Directors.  Notwithstanding the provisions of this
Section 4(c)(iii), no such special meeting shall be called during a period
within 60 days immediately preceding the date fixed for the next annual meeting
of stockholders.

                   (iv)  At any meeting held for the purpose of electing
directors at which the holders of such Preferred Stock shall have the right to
elect directors as provided herein, the presence in person or by proxy of the
holders of shares representing more than fifty percent (50%) in voting power of
the then outstanding shares of such Preferred Stock having such right shall be
required and shall be sufficient to constitute a quorum of such class for the
election of directors by such class.

                   (v)  Any director elected by holders of such Preferred Stock
pursuant to the voting right created under this Section 4(c) shall hold office
until the next annual meeting of stockholders (unless such term has previously
terminated pursuant to Section 4(c)(ii)) and any vacancy in respect of any such
director shall be filled only by vote of the remaining director so elected, or
if there be no such remaining director, by the holders of such Preferred Stock
entitled to elect such director or directors by written consent or at a special
meeting called in accordance with the procedures set forth in Section 4(c)(iii),
or, if no special meeting is called or written consent executed, at the next
annual meeting of stockholders.

                   (vi)  In exercising the voting rights set forth in this
Section 4(c), each share of Series B Preferred Stock shall have one vote per
share.

         Section 5.  CERTAIN RESTRICTIONS.
(a)  Whenever dividends or distributions payable on shares of Series B Preferred
Stock as provided in Section 3 for any prior quarterly dividend period are not
paid in full, thereafter and until all such unpaid dividends or distributions
payable, whether or not declared, on the outstanding shares of Series B
Preferred Stock shall have been paid in full or declared and set apart for
payment, the Corporation shall not: (i) redeem, purchase or otherwise acquire
for consideration any shares of Junior Stock or Parity Stock pursuant to any
mandatory redemption, put, sinking fund or other similar obligation; PROVIDED
that (A) the Corporation may at any time redeem, purchase or otherwise acquire
shares of Junior Stock or Parity Stock, in exchange for any shares of Common
Stock or for other capital stock of the Corporation ranking junior (both as to
dividends and upon liquidation, dissolution or winding up) to the Series B
Preferred Stock and (B) the Corporation

                                          8
<PAGE>

may accept shares of any Parity Stock for conversion; or (ii) redeem or purchase
or otherwise acquire for consideration any shares of Series B Preferred Stock;
PROVIDED that the Corporation may accept shares of Series B Preferred Stock
surrendered for conversion into shares of capital stock of the Corporation
pursuant to Section 9.

         (b)  The Corporation shall not permit any Subsidiary of the
Corporation to purchase or otherwise acquire for consideration any shares of
capital stock of the Corporation or to make or extend any loan or advance
specified in clause (iii) of Section 5(a) unless the Corporation could, pursuant
to paragraph (a) of this Section 5, purchase such shares at such time and in
such manner or make or extend such loan or advance at such time, as the case may
be.

         Section 6.  REDEMPTION OR EXCHANGE. 
(a)  The Corporation shall not have any right to redeem any shares of Series B
Preferred Stock prior to the third anniversary of the Issue Date (as defined in
Section 12).  The Corporation may, at its sole option, subject to Section 3(b)
hereof, from time to time on and after the third anniversary of the Issue Date,
at its election either: (i) redeem, out of funds legally available therefor, all
or any part of the outstanding shares of the Series B Preferred Stock at the
Redemption Price (as defined in Section 12); (ii) subject to Section 6(f)
hereof, exchange shares of Class A Common Stock (or such other class or series
of common stock into which shares of this Series are then convertible) for all
or any part of the outstanding shares of this Series at the Exchange Price (as
defined in Section 12); or (iii) subject to Section 6(f) hereof, effect a
combination of the options described in the foregoing clauses (i) and (ii) (in
which event each holder of shares of this Series which are selected for
redemption and exchange pursuant to Section 6(e) shall receive the same
proportion of cash and shares of Class A Common Stock (or such other class or
series of common stock into which shares of this Series are then convertible)
(except for cash paid in lieu of fractional shares) paid to other holders of
shares of this Series selected for redemption and exchange); PROVIDED, HOWEVER,
that shares of Series

                                          9
<PAGE>

B Preferred Stock shall not be redeemable by the Corporation prior to the fifth
anniversary of the Issue Date unless the Current Market Price (as defined in
Section 12) shall be greater than the product of (x) the Conversion Price (as
defined in Section 9) multiplied by (y) 1.35 , on at least 20 of the 30 Trading
Days immediately prior to the date of the notice delivered by the Corporation to
holders of shares of Series B Preferred Stock to be redeemed pursuant to
paragraph (d) of this Section 6.

         (b)  Not more than 60 nor less than 15 Trading Days prior to the
Redemption Date, the Corporation shall, if the Series B Preferred Stock is
listed on any national securities exchange or traded in the over-the-counter
market, give notice by publication in a newspaper of general circulation in the
Borough of Manhattan, The City of New York, that the Corporation has elected in
accordance with paragraph (a) of this Section 6 to redeem and/or exchange any or
all shares of the Series B Preferred Stock.  The notice shall also specify (i)
the percentage of the Series B Preferred Stock to be redeemed and/or exchanged,
if less than all, (ii) if more than one form of consideration has been elected
by the Corporation, the portion of such shares to be redeemed and the portion of
such shares to be exchanged, (iii) the Redemption Price and the manner in which
the Exchange Price shall be calculated prior to the Redemption Date, and (iv)
the procedures to be followed to receive payment of the Redemption Price and/or
the Exchange Price, as the case may be; and, a similar notice shall be mailed
concurrently to each record holder of shares of Series B Preferred Stock, at
such holder's address as it appears on the transfer books of the Corporation;
PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that if the Series B Preferred Stock is owned of record by 50
or fewer holders or groups of affiliated holders, the Corporation shall publicly
announce the information contained in the notice by issuance of a press release
and such notice shall be mailed in not more than 60 or less than 15 Trading Days
prior to the Redemption Date, and shall set forth the information contained
above.

         (c)  On or before the Redemption Date, the Corporation shall deposit
for the benefit of the

                                          10

<PAGE>

holders of shares of Series B Preferred Stock, in the case of a redemption, the
funds necessary for such redemption and, in the case of an exchange,
certificates representing the shares of Class A Common Stock to be exchanged,
with a bank or trust company in the Borough of Manhattan, The City of New York,
or in the City of Boston, in either case having a capital and surplus of at
least $2,000,000,000.  Any moneys or certificates so deposited by the
Corporation and unclaimed at the end of two years from the date designated for
such redemption or exchange shall be released from any such deposit and revert
to the general funds of the Corporation.  After such conversion, any such bank
or trust company shall, upon demand, pay over to the Corporation such unclaimed
amounts or certificates, as the case may be, and thereupon such bank or trust
company shall be relieved of all responsibility in respect thereof and any
holder of shares of Series B Preferred Stock to be redeemed shall look only to
the Corporation for the payment of the Redemption Price.  In the event that
moneys or certificates are deposited pursuant to this paragraph (c) in respect
of shares of Series B Preferred Stock that are converted in accordance with the
provisions of Section 9, such moneys or certificates, as the case may be, shall,
upon such conversion, be released from any such deposit and revert to the
Corporation.  After such reversion, any such bank or trust company shall pay
over to the Corporation such moneys or certificates and shall be relieved of all
responsibility to the holders of such converted shares in respect thereof.  Any
interest accrued on funds deposited pursuant to this paragraph (c) shall be paid
from time to time to the Corporation.

         (d)  Notice of redemption or exchange having been given as aforesaid,
upon the deposit of funds or certificates, as the case may be, pursuant to
paragraph (c) in respect of shares of Series B Preferred Stock to be redeemed or
exchanged pursuant to this Section 6, notwithstanding that any certificates for
such shares to be redeemed or exchanged shall not have been surrendered for
cancellation, from and after the Redemption Date (i) the shares represented
thereby shall no longer be deemed outstanding, (ii) the rights to receive
dividends thereon shall cease and terminate and

                                          11
<PAGE>

dividends on the Series B Preferred Stock shall cease to accrue and (iii) all
rights of the holders of shares of Series B Preferred Stock to be redeemed or
exchange shall cease and terminate, excepting only the right to receive the
Redemption Price and/or Exchange Price therefor, without any interest thereon.

         (e)  In the event that fewer than all of the outstanding shares of
this Series are to be redeemed and/or exchanged pursuant to Section 6(a),
subject to clause (iii) of the second sentence of section 6(a), the aggregate
number of shares of this Series held by each holder which will be redeemed
and/or exchanged shall be determined by the Corporation by lot or pro rata or by
any other method as may be determined by the Board of Directors in its sole
discretion to be equitable, and the certificate of the Corporation's Secretary
or an Assistant Secretary filed with the transfer agent or transfer agents for
this Series in respect of such determination by the Board of Directors shall be
conclusive.

         (f)  Notwithstanding anything contained herein to the contrary, the
Corporation shall not be permitted to exchange any shares of Class A Common
Stock (or such other class or series of common stock into which shares of this
Series are convertible) for all or any part of the outstanding shares of this
Series if such stock which the Corporation seeks to exchange for shares of this
Series is not listed or admitted for trading on any national securities exchange
or the Nasdaq National Market.  In connection with the exchange of any shares of
this Series, the Corporation may, but shall not be required to, issue a fraction
of a share of Class A Common Stock (or such other class or series of common
stock into which shares of this Series are then convertible) and, if the
Corporation shall determine not to issue such fraction, the Corporation shall
pay a cash payment (rounded to the nearest cent) equal to such fraction
multiplied by the Current Market Price per share of Class A Common Stock (or
such other class or series of common stock into which shares of this Series are
then convertible) on the last Trading Day prior to the Redemption Date.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, this Section 6(f) shall in no way

                                          12
<PAGE>

restrict or limit the Corporation's right to redeem all or any part of the
outstanding shares of this Series for cash at the Redemption Price.

         Section 7.  REACQUIRED SHARES.  Any shares of Series B Preferred Stock
converted, redeemed, purchased or otherwise acquired by the Corporation in any
manner whatsoever shall be retired and canceled promptly after the acquisition
thereof.  All such shares of Series B Preferred Stock shall upon their
cancellation, and upon the filing of an appropriate certificate with the
Secretary of State of the State of Delaware, become authorized but unissued
shares of Preferred Stock, par value $.01 per share, of the Corporation and may
be reissued as part of another series of Preferred Stock, par value $.01 per
share, of the Corporation subject to the conditions or restrictions on issuance
set forth herein.

         Section 8.  LIQUIDATION, DISSOLUTION OR WINDING UP.  (a)  Upon the
liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the Corporation, whether voluntary or
involuntary, no distribution shall be made (i) to the holders of shares of
Junior Stock upon liquidation, dissolution or winding up unless, prior thereto,
the holders of shares of Series B Preferred Stock, subject to Section 9, shall
have received the Liquidation Preference (as defined in Section 12 with respect
to each share, or (ii) to the holders of shares of Parity Stock upon
liquidation, dissolution or winding up, except distributions made ratably on all
such Parity Stock and the Series B Preferred Stock in proportion to the total
amounts to which the holders of all shares of such Parity Stock and the Series B
Preferred Stock are entitled upon such liquidation, dissolution or winding up.

         (b)  Neither the consolidation, merger or other business combination
of the Corporation with or into any other Person or Persons nor the sale of all
or substantially all the assets of the Corporation shall be deemed to be a
liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the Corporation for purposes of this
Section 8.

         Section 9.  CONVERSION.  (a)  Each holder of shares of Series B
Preferred Stock may, at its

                                          13
<PAGE>

option at any time and from time to time, upon surrender of the certificates
therefor, convert any or all of its shares of Series B Preferred Stock into
Common Stock as follows.  The number of fully paid and nonassessable shares of
Class A Common Stock deliverable on conversion of a share of Series B Preferred
Stock is referred to as the "Conversion Ratio".  The Conversion Ratio shall
initially be equal to the quotient of $50 per share divided by the Conversion
Price and shall be subject to adjustment from time to time pursuant to paragraph
(f) of this Section 9.  The "Conversion Price" shall be equal to the product of
1.25 multiplied by the greater of: (i) $20 per share, (ii) if shares of Class A
Common Stock are publicly traded on the New York Stock Exchange, then over the
fifteen Trading Days beginning the first Trading Day after the announcement of
the termination of the Merger Agreement (the "Measurement Period"), (a) if the
average of the daily volume of Class A Common Stock traded during the
Measurement Period exceeds or is equal to 100,000 shares per day, the average of
the Current Market Price of Class A Common Stock over the Measurement Period, or
(b) if the average of the daily volume of Class A Common Stock traded during the
Measurement Period is less than 100,000 shares per day, the product of .925
multiplied by the average of the Current Market Price of Class A Common Stock
over the Measurement Period, or (iii) if shares of Class A Common Stock are
publicly traded on the Nasdaq National Market, over the Measurement Period, (a)
if the average of the daily volume of Class A Common Stock traded during the
Measurement Period exceeds or is equal to 200,000 shares per day, the average of
the Current Market Price of Class A Common Stock over the Measurement Period, or
(b) if the average of the daily volume of Class A Common Stock traded during the
Measurement Period is less than 200,000 shares per day, the product of .925
multiplied by the average of the Current Market Price of Class A Common Stock
over the Measurement Period.

         (b)  Conversion of the Series B Preferred Stock may be effected by any
such holder upon the surrender to the Corporation at the principal office of the
Corporation in the Commonwealth of Massachusetts (the "Transfer Agent") or at
the

                                          14
<PAGE>

office of any agent or agents of the Corporation, as may be designated by the
Board of Directors of the Corporation, of the certificate for such Series B
Preferred Stock to be converted at any time after the Issue Date accompanied by
a written notice stating that such holder elects to convert all or a specified
whole number of such shares in accordance with the provisions of this Section 9
and specifying the name or names in which such holder wishes the certificate or
certificates for shares of Common Stock to be issued.  In case such notice shall
specify a name or names other than that of such holder, such notice shall be
accompanied by payment of all issue, stamp, documentation and transfer taxes
payable upon the issuance of shares of Common Stock in such name or names.
Other than such taxes, the Corporation will pay any and all issue, stamp,
documentation, transfer and other taxes (other than taxes based on gross or net
income) that may be payable in respect of any issue or delivery of shares of
Common Stock on conversion of Series B Preferred Stock pursuant hereto.  As
promptly as practicable, and in any event within five Business Days after the
surrender of such certificate or certificates and the receipt of such notice
relating thereto and, if such notice shall specify a name or names other than
that of such holder, (a) payment of all transfer taxes (or the demonstration to
the satisfaction of the Corporation that such taxes have been paid), and (b)
unless such issuance is registered under the Securities Act and all applicable
state securities laws, the holder of the applicable shares of Series B Preferred
Stock which are to be converted into Class A Common Stock hereunder shall have
furnished to the Corporation evidence satisfactory to it that such issuance is
exempt from registration under the Securities Act and all applicable state
securities laws, the Corporation shall deliver or cause to be delivered (i)
certificates representing the number of validly issued, fully paid and non
assessable full shares of Class A Common Stock to which the holder of shares of
Series B Preferred Stock being converted shall be entitled and (ii) if less than
the full number of shares of Series B Preferred Stock evidenced by the
surrendered certificate or certificates is being converted, a new certificate or
certificates, of like tenor, for the number of shares evidenced by such
surrendered certificate or

                                          15
<PAGE>

certificates less the number of shares being converted.  Such conversion shall
be deemed to have been made at the close of business on the date of receipt of
such notice and of such surrender of the certificate or certificates
representing the shares of Series B Preferred Stock to be converted so that the
rights of the holder thereof as to the shares being converted shall cease except
for the right to receive shares of Class A Common Stock in accordance herewith,
and the person entitled to receive the shares of Class A Common Stock shall be
treated for all purposes as having become the record holder of such shares of
Class A Common Stock at such time.  The Corporation shall not be required to
convert, and no surrender of shares of Series B Preferred Stock shall be
effective for that purpose, while the transfer books of the Corporation for the
Common Stock are closed for any purpose (but not for any period in excess of 2
days); but the surrender of shares of Series B Preferred Stock for conversion
during any period while such books are so closed shall become effective for
conversion immediately upon the reopening of such books, as if the conversion
had been made on the date such shares of Series B Preferred Stock were
surrendered, and at the Conversion Ratio in effect at the date of such
surrender.

         (c)  In case any shares of Series B Preferred Stock are to be redeemed
pursuant to Section 6, the right of conversion under this Section 9 shall cease
and terminate as to the shares of Series B Preferred Stock to be redeemed at the
close of business on the second Business Day next preceding the Redemption Date
unless the Corporation shall default in the payment of the Redemption Price.

         (d)  In connection with the conversion of any shares of Series B
Preferred Stock, no fractions of shares of Class A Common Stock shall be issued,
but in lieu thereof the Corporation shall pay a cash adjustment in respect of
such fractional interest in an amount equal to such fractional interest
multiplied by the Current Market Price per share of Class A Common Stock on the
Trading Day on which such shares of Series B Preferred Stock are deemed to have
been converted.

                                          16

<PAGE>

If more than one share of Series B Preferred Stock shall be surrendered for
conversion by the same holder at the same time, the number of full shares of
Class A Common Stock issuable on conversion thereof shall be computed on the
basis of the total number of shares of Series B Preferred Stock so surrendered.

         (e)  The Corporation shall at all times reserve and keep available for
issuance upon the conversion of the Series B Preferred Stock, such number of its
authorized but unissued shares of Class A Common Stock as will from time to time
be sufficient to permit the conversion of all outstanding shares of Series B
Preferred Stock, and shall take all action required to increase the authorized
number of shares of Class A Common Stock if necessary to permit the conversion
of all outstanding shares of Series B Preferred Stock.

         (f)  The Conversion Ratio shall be subject to adjustment from time to
time as follows:

         (i)  In case the Corporation shall (i) declare a dividend or make a
    distribution on the outstanding shares of its Common Stock in shares of its
    Common Stock, (ii) subdivide its outstanding shares of Common Stock into a
    greater number of shares, or (iii) combine its outstanding shares of Common
    Stock into a smaller number of shares, the Conversion Price in effect at the
    time of the record date for such dividend or distribution or the effective
    date of such subdivision or combination shall be proportionately adjusted so
    that the holder of any shares of Series B Preferred Stock surrendered for
    conversion after such time shall be entitled to receive the aggregate number
    of shares of Class A Common Stock which the holder would have owned or been
    entitled to receive had such shares of Series B Preferred Stock been
    converted immediately prior to such record date or effective date and the
    resulting Common Stock  had been subject to such dividend, distribution,
    subdivision or combination.  An adjustment made pursuant to this clause (i)
    shall become effective (x) in the case of any such dividend or distribution,
    immediately after the close of business on the record date

                                          17
<PAGE>

    for the determination of holders of shares of Common Stock entitled to
    receive such dividend or distribution, or (y) in the case of any such
    subdivision, combination, consolidation or reclassification, at the close
    of business on the day upon which such corporate action becomes effective.

         (ii) If the Corporation shall issue rights, warrants or options to all
    holders of Class A Common Stock entitling them (for a period not exceeding
    45 days from the record date referred to below) to subscribe for or
    purchase shares of Class A Common Stock at a price per share less than the
    Current Market Price (determined over the Value Period (as defined in
    Section 12) as of the date of determination of stockholders entitled to
    receive such rights, warrants or options), then, in any such event, the
    Conversion Ratio shall be adjusted by multiplying the Conversion Ratio in
    effect immediately prior to the opening of business on such record date by
    a fraction, the numerator of which shall be the number of shares of Class A
    Common Stock outstanding on such record date plus the maximum number of
    additional shares of Class A Common Stock offered for subscription pursuant
    to such rights, warrants or options, and the denominator of which shall be
    the number of shares of Class A Common Stock outstanding on such record
    date plus the maximum number of additional shares of Class A Common Stock
    which the aggregate offering price of the maximum number of shares of Class
    A Common Stock so offered for subscription or purchase pursuant to such
    rights, warrants or options would purchase at such Current Market Price
    (determined by multiplying such maximum number of shares by the exercise
    price of such rights, warrants or options (plus any other consideration
    received by the Corporation upon the issuance or exercise of such rights,
    warrants or options) and dividing the product so obtained by such Current
    Market Price).  Such adjustment shall become effective at the opening of
    business on the day next following the record date for the determination of
    stockholders entitled to receive such rights, warrants or options.  To the
    extent that shares

                                          18

<PAGE>

    of Class A Common Stock are not delivered after the expiration of such
    rights, warrants or options, the Conversion Ratio shall be readjusted to
    the Conversion Ratio which would then be in effect had the adjustments made
    upon the record date for the determination of stockholders entitled to
    receive such rights, warrants or options been made upon the basis of
    delivery of only the number of shares of Class A Common Stock actually
    delivered and the amount actually paid therefor.  In determining whether
    any rights, warrants or options entitle the holders to subscribe for or
    purchase shares of Class A Common Stock at a price per share less than such
    Current Market Price, there shall be taken into account any consideration
    received by the Corporation upon issuance and upon exercise of such rights,
    warrants or options.  The value of such consideration, if other than cash,
    shall be determined by the good faith business judgment of the Board of
    Directors, whose determination shall be conclusive.

         (iii)  If the Corporation shall pay a dividend or make a distribution
    to all holders of outstanding shares of Class A Common Stock, of capital
    stock, cash, evidences of its indebtedness or other assets of the
    Corporation (but excluding (x) any cash dividends or distributions (other
    than Extraordinary Cash Distributions) and (y) dividends or distributions
    referred to in Section 9(f)(i)), then the Conversion Ratio shall be
    adjusted by multiplying the Conversion Ratio in effect immediately prior to
    the opening of business on the record date for the determination of
    stockholders entitled to receive such dividend or distribution by a
    fraction, the numerator of which shall be the Current Market Price
    (determined over the Value Period as of such record date), and the
    denominator of which shall be such Current Market Price less either (A) the
    fair market value (as determined by the good faith business judgment of the
    Board of Directors, whose determination shall be conclusive), as of such
    record date, of the portion of the capital stock assets or evidences of
    indebtedness to be so distributed

                                          19
<PAGE>

    applicable to one share of Class A Common Stock or (B), if applicable, the
    amount of the Extraordinary Cash Distribution to be distributed per share
    of Class A Common Stock.  The adjustment pursuant to the foregoing
    provisions of this Section 9(f)(iii) shall become effective at the opening
    of business on the day next following the record date for the determination
    of stockholders entitled to receive such dividend or distribution.

         (iv) In lieu of making an adjustment to the Conversion Ratio pursuant
    to Sections 9(f)(i), 9(f)(ii) or 9(f)(iii) above for a dividend or
    distribution or an issue or rights, warrants or options, the Corporation
    may distribute to the holders of shares of Series B Preferred Stock, or
    reserve for distribution with each share of Class A Common Stock delivered
    to a person converting a share of Series B Preferred Stock pursuant to this
    Section 9, such dividend or distribution or such rights, warrants or
    options; PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that in the case of such a reservation, on the
    date, if any, on which a person converting a share of Series B Preferred
    Stock would no longer be entitled to receive such dividend or distribution
    or to receive or exercise such rights, warrants or options, such dividend
    or distribution shall be deemed to have occurred, or such rights, warrants
    or options shall be deemed to have issued, and the Conversion Ratio shall
    be adjusted as provided in Section 9(f)(i), 9(f)(ii) or 9(f)(iii), as the
    case may be (with such termination date being the relevant date of
    determination for purposes of determining the Current Market Price).

         (v)  The Corporation shall be entitled to make such additional
    increases in the Conversion Ratio, in addition to those required by
    subsections 9(f)(i) thorough 9(f)(iii), as shall be determined by the Board
    of Directors to be necessary in order that any dividend or distribution in
    Class A Common Stock, any subdivision, reclassification or combination of
    shares of Class A Common Stock or any issuance of rights or warrants
    referred to above, shall not be taxable to the holders of Class A Common

    Stock for United States Federal income tax purposes.

         (vi)   To the extent permitted by applicable law, the Corporation may
    from time to time increase the Conversion Ratio by any amount for any
    period of time if the period is at least 20 Trading Days, the increase is
    irrevocable during such period and the Board of Directors shall have made a
    determination that such increase would be in the best interests of the
    Corporation, which determination shall be conclusive.

         (vii)  In any case in which this Section 9(f) shall require that any
    adjustment be made effective as of or immediately following a record date,
    the Corporation may elect to defer (but only for five (5) Trading Days
    following the occurrence of the event which necessitates the filing of the
    statement referred to in Section 10) issuing to the holder of any shares of
    this Series converted after such record date (i) the shares of Class A
    Common Stock and other capital stock of the Corporation issuable upon such
    conversion over and above the shares of Class A Common Stock and other
    capital stock of the Corporation issuable upon such conversion on the basis
    of the Conversion Ratio prior to adjustment and (ii) paying to such holder
    any amount in cash in lieu of any fraction thereof pursuant to Section
    9(d); PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that the Corporation shall deliver to such holder
    a due bill or other appropriate instrument evidencing such holder's right
    to receive such additional shares upon the occurrence of the event
    requiring such adjustment.

         (viii) For purposes of this paragraph (f), the number of shares of
    Common Stock at any time outstanding shall not include any shares of Common
    Stock then owned or held by or for the account of the Corporation or a
    Subsidiary of the Corporation.

         (xi) The certificate of any firm of independent public accountants of
    recognized standing selected by the Board of Directors of

                                          21
<PAGE>

    the Corporation (which may be the firm of independent public accountants
    regularly employed by the Corporation) shall be presumptively correct for
    any computation made under this paragraph (f).

         (x)  If the Corporation shall take a record of the holders of its
    Common Stock for the purpose of entitling them to receive a dividend or
    other distribution, and shall thereafter and before the distribution to
    stockholders thereof legally abandon its plan to pay or deliver such
    dividend or distribution, then thereafter no adjustment in the number of
    shares of Common Stock issuable upon exercise of the right of conversion
    granted by this paragraph (f) or in the Conversion Ratio then in effect
    shall be required by reason of the taking of such record.

         (g)  In case of any capital reorganization or reclassification of
outstanding shares of Common Stock (other than a reclassification covered by
paragraph (f)(i) of this Section 9), or in case of any consolidation or merger
of the Corporation with or into another corporation, or in case of any sale or
conveyance to another corporation of the property of the Corporation as an
entirety or substantially as an entirety (each of the foregoing being referred
to as a "Transaction"), each share of Series B Preferred Stock then outstanding
shall thereafter be convertible into, in lieu of the Class A Common Stock
issuable upon such conversion prior to the consummation of such Transaction, the
kind and amount of shares of stock and other securities and property (including
cash) receivable upon the consummation of such Transaction by a holder of that
number of shares of Class A Common Stock into which one share of Series B
Preferred Stock was convertible immediately prior to such Transaction
(including, on a pro rata basis, the cash, securities or property received by
holders of Class A Common Stock in any tender or exchange offer that is a step
in such Transaction).  In any such case, if necessary, appropriate adjustment
(as determined by the Board of Directors) shall be made in the application of
the provisions set forth in this Section 9 with respect to rights and interests
thereafter of the holders of shares of Series B

                                          22
<PAGE>

Preferred Stock to the end that the provisions set forth herein for the
protection of the conversion rights of the Series B Preferred Stock shall
thereafter be applicable, as nearly as reasonably may be, to any such other
shares of stock and other securities and property deliverable upon conversion of
the shares of Series B Preferred Stock remaining outstanding.  In case
securities or property other than Class A Common Stock shall be issuable or
deliverable upon conversion as aforesaid, then all references in this Section 9
shall be deemed to apply, so far as appropriate and as nearly as may be, to such
other securities or property.

         Notwithstanding anything contained herein to the contrary, the
Corporation will not effect any Transaction unless, prior to the consummation
thereof, the Surviving Person (as defined in Section 12) thereof shall assume,
by written instrument mailed to each record holder of shares of Series B
Preferred Stock at the addresses of each as shown on the books of the
Corporation maintained by the Transfer Agent thereof if such shares are held by
50 or fewer holders or groups of affiliated holders or to each Transfer Agent
for the shares of Series B Preferred Stock at the addresses of each as shown on
the books of the Corporation maintained by the Transfer Agent thereof, if such
shares are held by a greater number of holders, the obligation to deliver to
such holder such cash and such securities to which, in accordance with the
foregoing provisions, such holder is entitled and such Surviving Person shall
have mailed to each record holder of shares of Series B Preferred Stock at the
addresses of each as shown on the books of the Corporation maintained by the
Transfer Agent thereof, if such shares are held by 50 or fewer holders or groups
of affiliated holders, or to each Transfer Agent for the shares of Series B
Preferred Stock, if such shares are held by a greater number of holders, an
opinion of independent counsel for such Person stating that such assumption
agreement is a valid, binding and enforceable agreement of the Surviving Person
(subject to customary exceptions).

         (h)  In case at any time or from time to time the Corporation shall
pay any dividend or make any other distribution to the holders of its Common

                                          23
<PAGE>

Stock, or shall offer for subscription pro rata to the holders of its Common
Stock any additional shares of stock of any class or any other right, or there
shall be any capital reorganization or reclassification of the Common Stock of
the Corporation or consolidation or merger of the Corporation with or into
another corporation, or any sale or conveyance to another corporation of the
property of the Corporation as an entirety or substantially as an entirety, or
there shall be a voluntary or involuntary dissolution, liquidation or winding up
of the Corporation, then, in any one or more of said cases the Corporation shall
give at least 10 days' prior written notice (the time of mailing of such notice
shall be deemed to be the time of giving thereof) to the record holders of the
Series B Preferred Stock at the addresses of each as shown on the books of the
Corporation maintained by the Transfer Agent thereof of the date on which (i)
the books of the Corporation shall close or a record shall be taken for such
stock dividend, distribution or subscription rights or (ii) such reorganization,
reclassification, consolidation, merger, sale or conveyance, dissolution,
liquidation or winding up shall take place, as the case may be, provided that in
the case of any Transaction to which paragraph (g) of this Section 9 applies the
Corporation shall give at least 30 days' prior written notice as aforesaid.
Such notice shall also specify the date as of which the holders of the Common
Stock and of the Series B Preferred Stock of record shall participate in said
dividend, distribution or subscription rights or shall be entitled to exchange
their Common Stock or Series B Preferred Stock for securities or other property
deliverable upon such reorganization, reclassification, consolidation, merger,
sale or conveyance or participate in such dissolution, liquidation or winding
up, as the case may be.  Failure to give such notice shall not invalidate any
action so taken.

         (i)  The Corporation will at no time effect conversion of any Series B
Preferred Stock pursuant to this Section 9, and any purported conversion of any
Series B Preferred Stock shall be null and void, if such conversion would result
in

                                          24
<PAGE>

the violation of a Legal Prohibition (as defined in Section 12).

         (j)  All calculations under this Section 9 shall be made to the
nearest cent or to the nearest one one-hundredth of a share of Common Stock as
the case may be.  Notwithstanding any other provision of this Section 9, the
Corporation shall not be required to make any adjustment of the Conversion Ratio
unless such adjustment would require an increase or decrease of at least 1.00%
of such Conversion Ratio.  Any lesser adjustment shall be carried forward and
shall be made at the time of and together with the next subsequent adjustment
which, together with any adjustment or adjustments so carried forward, shall
amount to an increase or decrease of at least 1.00% in the Conversion Ratio.
Any adjustments under this Section 9 shall be made successively whenever an
event requiring such an adjustment occurs.

         (k)  Upon the surrender of certificates representing shares of Series
B Preferred Stock in accordance with the terms hereof, the Person converting or
exchanging shall be deemed to be the holder of record at such time of the shares
of Class A Common Stock and other securities or property issuable on such
conversion or exchange and all rights with respect to the shares of Series B
Preferred Stock surrendered shall forthwith terminate except the right to
receive the shares of Class A Common Stock or other securities or property
issuable on such conversion or exchange, as the case may be.  If any shares of
Series B Preferred Stock are surrendered for conversion or exchange subsequent
to the record date preceding a Dividend Payment Date but on or prior to such
Dividend Payment Date (except shares called for redemption or exchange on a
Redemption Date between such record date and Dividend Payment Date), the
registered holder of such shares at the closed of business on such record date
shall be entitled to receive the dividend, if any, payable on such shares on
such Dividend Payment Date notwithstanding the conversion thereof.  Except as
provided in this Section 9, no adjustments in respect of payments of dividends
on shares surrendered for conversion or exchange or any dividend on the Common
Stock issued upon conversion

                                          25
<PAGE>

or exchange shall be made upon the conversion or exchange of any shares of this
Series.

         (l)  The Corporation will endeavor to list the shares of (or
depositary shares representing fractional interests in) Class A Common Stock
required to be delivered upon conversion of shares of Series B Preferred Stock
prior to such delivery upon the principal national securities exchange upon
which the outstanding Class A Common Stock is listed at the time of such
delivery.

         Section 10.  REPORTS AS TO ADJUSTMENTS.  Upon any adjustment of the
Conversion Ratio then in effect and any increase or decrease in the number of
shares of Common Stock issuable upon the operation of the conversion set forth
in Section 9, then, and in each such case, the Corporation shall promptly
deliver to the Transfer Agent of the Series B Preferred Stock and Common Stock a
certificate signed by the President or a Vice President and by the Treasurer or
an Assistant Treasurer or the Secretary or an Assistant Secretary of the
Corporation setting forth in reasonable detail the event requiring the
adjustment and the method by which such adjustment was calculated and specifying
the Conversion Ratio then in effect following such adjustment and the increased
or decreased number of shares issuable upon the conversion set forth in Section
9.  The Corporation shall also promptly after the making of such adjustment give
written notice to the record holders of the Series B Preferred Stock at the
address of each holder as shown on the books of the Corporation maintained by
the Transfer Agent thereof, which notice shall state the Conversion Ratio then
in effect, as adjusted, and the increased or decreased number of shares issuable
upon the exercise of the right of conversion granted by Section 9, and shall set
forth in reasonable detail the method of calculation of each and a brief
statement of the facts requiring such adjustment.  Where appropriate, such
notice to record holders of the Series B Preferred Stock may be given in advance
and included as part of the notice required under the provisions of Section
9(h).

<PAGE>

                                      AGREEMENT

    NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the foregoing recitals and the mutual
covenants contained herein, and of other good and valuable consideration, the
receipt and sufficiency of which are hereby acknowledged, the Company and the
Holder, intending to be legally bound, each hereby agrees as follows:


                                      ARTICLE 1

                          REGISTRATION UNDER SECURITIES ACT

    Section 1.01  REGISTRATION UPON REQUEST.  (a)  REQUEST.  Subject to
the provisions of this Agreement (including Section 4.11 hereof), upon the
written request of the Holder requesting that the Company effect the
registration under the Securities Act of Registrable Securities (as hereinafter
defined), which request shall specify in reasonable detail the number of
Registrable Securities to be registered and the intended method of distribution
thereof, the Company shall use its best efforts to register under the Securities
Act (a "DEMAND REGISTRATION"), including by means of a shelf registration
pursuant to Rule 415 under the Securities Act if so requested in such request
and if the Company is then eligible to use such a registration, as expeditiously
as may be practicable, the Registrable Securities which the Company has been
requested to register by the Holder, all to the extent requisite to permit the
disposition of such Registrable Securities in accordance with the plan of
distribution set forth in the applicable registration statement.  In the case of
such Demand Registration, the Holder must request registration of Registrable
Securities representing not less than such number of Registrable Securities the
Expected Proceeds of which, on the date of the aforementioned written request,
would equal at least $100 million unless such registration request is for all
remaining Registrable Securities.

         (b)  REGISTRATION OF OTHER SECURITIES.  Whenever the Company shall
effect a registration pursuant to this Section 1.01 in connection with an
underwritten offering by the Holder of Registrable Securities, no securities
(other than Registrable Securities) shall be included among the securities
covered by such registration if the managing underwriter, if any, of such
offering shall have advised the Holder and the Company in writing


                                         -2-

<PAGE>

of its belief that the inclusion of such other securities would substantially
interfere with such offering.

         (c)  REGISTRATION STATEMENT FORM.  Registrations under this Section
1.01 shall be on such appropriate registration form of the Commission as shall
be selected by the Company and available to it under the Securities Act.  The
Company agrees to include in any such registration statement all information
which, in the opinion of counsel to the Holder and counsel to the Company, is
reasonably required to be included therein under the Securities Act.

         (d)  LIMITATIONS ON REGISTRATION; EXPENSES.  The Company will not be
required to effect more than two (2) Demand Registrations pursuant to this
Section 1.01.  Subject to the provisions of Sections 1.01(h) and 1.02(b) hereof,
the Company shall pay the Registration Expenses in connection with such Demand
Registration.

         (e)  EFFECTIVE REGISTRATION STATEMENT.  Subject to the provisions of
Section 1.01(i) hereof, a registration requested pursuant to this Section 1.01
shall not be deemed to have been effected (i) unless a registration statement
with respect thereto has become effective, (ii) if after it has become
effective, such registration is materially interfered with by any stop order,
injunction or similar order or requirement of the Commission or other
governmental agency or court for any reason not attributable to any of the
Holder and has not thereafter become effective, or (iii) if the conditions to
closing specified in the underwriting agreement, if any, entered into in
connection with such registration are not satisfied or waived, other than by
reason of a failure on the part of the Holder.

         (f)  SELECTION OF UNDERWRITERS.  In the case of such Demand
Registration, the selection of any managing underwriter(s) shall be made by the
Company (with the consent of the Holder, which consent shall not be unreasonably
withheld), PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that (i) the Holder shall be entitled to select
(with the consent of the Company, which consent shall not be unreasonably
withheld) one (1) managing underwriter other than the lead managing underwriter,
and (ii) the selection of the underwriters (other than the managing
underwriter(s)) shall be made by the mutual agreement of the Company and the
Holder.

         (g)  CERTAIN REQUIREMENTS IN CONNECTION WITH REGISTRATION RIGHTS.  In
the case of such Demand Registration, if the Holder has determined to enter into
one or more underwriting agreements in connection therewith, no Person may
participate in such Demand Registration unless such Person agrees to sell his or
its securities on the basis provided in the underwriting arrangements and
completes all questionnaires, powers of attorney, indemnities, underwriting
agreements and other documents which are reasonable and customary under the
circumstances.

         (h)  PRIORITY IN DEMAND REGISTRATION.  If the managing underwriter of
any underwritten offering shall advise the Company in writing (with a copy to
the Holder) that, in its opinion, the number of Registrable Securities requested
to be included in such registration exceeds the number which can be sold in such
offering within a price range acceptable to the Holder, the Company will reduce
to the number which the Company is so advised can be sold in such offering
within such price range (the "Actual Number of Securities to be Registered"),
the Registrable Securities requested to be included in such registration.  If,
as a result of any such reduction, the number of Registrable Securities
requested to be included in such registration by the Holder of the Registrable
Securities is reduced by twenty-five percent (25%) or more, then notwithstanding
anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, a Demand Registration in
connection with such registration will not be deemed to have been effected under
Section 1.01(e) hereof; PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that the provisions of this sentence
shall apply to and be operative in respect of only the first request in writing
made by the Holder under this Section 1.01 for the registration of Registrable
Securities.  In the case of such a registration which would have been deemed to
be a Demand Registration under Section 1.01(e) hereof but for the application of
the immediately preceding sentence of this Section 1.01(h), (i) the Company
nonetheless shall pay the Registration Expenses of the Holder in connection with
such registration, and (ii) no securities other than Registrable Securities
shall be covered by such registration.

         (i)  CERTAIN OTHER MATTERS.  For purposes of Section 1.01(e)(i)
hereof, should a Demand Registration not become effective due to the failure of
the Holder to perform its obligations under this Agreement or the inability of
the Holder to reach agreement with the underwriters on price or other


                                         -4-

<PAGE>

customary terms for such transaction, or in the event the Holder withdraws or
does not pursue the request for the Demand Registration (in each of the
foregoing cases, provided that at such time the Company is in compliance in all
material respects with its obligations under this Agreement), then, except as
otherwise provided in the last sentence of this Section 1.01(i), such Demand
Registration shall be deemed to have been effected.  In such event, the Holder
shall reimburse the Company for all of the Registration Expenses (other than the
Registration Expenses referred to in clause (a) of the definition of
Registration Expenses) incurred by the Company in the preparation, filing and
processing of such registration.  If such reimbursement is made within thirty
(30) business days following a request therefor, a Demand Registration shall not
be deemed to have been effected for purposes of this Section 1.01.

    Section 1.02  INCIDENTAL REGISTRATION.  (a)  RIGHTS TO INCLUDE.  Subject to
the provisions of this Agreement (including Section 4.11 hereof)and the rights
of the holders of the CP/BV Registrable Securities under the BV Agreement or the
CP Agreement, if at any time the Company proposes to register the offering for
cash of any shares of Class A Common Stock under the Securities Act on Form S-1,
S-2 or S-3 (or any successor or similar form thereto) for the account of the
Company, the Company shall furnish prompt written notice to the Holder of its
intention to effect such registration and the intended method of distribution in
connection therewith.  Upon the written request of the Holder made to the
Company within fifteen (15) business days after the delivery of the
aforementioned notice by the Company, which request shall specify the number of
shares of Registrable Securities intended to be registered, the Company shall
include such Registrable Securities in such registration, subject however to the
following sentence of this Section 1.02(a) and to the provisions of Section
1.02(c) hereof.  If the Company shall thereafter determine in its sole
discretion not to register or to delay the registration of such securities, the
Company may, at its election, provide written notice of such determination to
the Holder and, (i) in the case of a determination not to effect a registration,
shall thereupon be relieved of the obligation to register such Registrable
Securities (but, under such circumstances, the Company shall pay any
Registration Expenses reasonably incurred by the Holder until such time as the
Holder received the Company's written notice) and, (ii) in the case of a
determination to delay a registration, shall thereupon be permitted to delay
registering any Registrable Securities for the


                                         -5-

<PAGE>

same period as the delay in respect of securities being registered for the
Company's own account.  No incidental registration effected pursuant to this
Section 1.02 shall be deemed to have been effected or otherwise relieve the
Company of any of its obligations to the Holder pursuant to Section 1.01 hereof.

         (b)  In connection with any incidental registration as provided in
Section 1.02(a) hereof, the Company shall pay the Registration Expenses for the
registration in question.

         (c)  PRIORITY IN INCIDENTAL REGISTRATIONS.  If the lead managing
underwriter of any underwritten offering shall inform the Company by letter of
its belief that the number of Registrable Securities requested to be included in
such registration would substantially interfere with (including without
limitation adversely affect the pricing of) such offering, then the Company will
include in such registration, to the extent of the number and type which the
Company is so advised can be sold in (or during the time of) such offering
without such substantial interference, FIRST, all securities proposed by the
Company to be sold for its own account, SECOND, subject to the provisions of
Section 4.11 hereof, all securities of the Company ranking senior to or on a
parity with (as to rights to dividends and upon liquidation) the Company's
Series A Participating Convertible Preferred Stock ("Senior Securities") and
CP/BV Registrable Securities requested to be included in such registration (such
securities to be included in such registration pro rata on the basis of the
Expected Proceeds from the sale thereof), and THIRD, any other securities of the
Company requested to be included in such registration.


    Section 1.03  REGISTRATION PROCEDURES.  If and whenever the Company is
required by the provisions of this Agreement to effect or cause the registration
of any Registrable Securities under the Securities Act as provided in this
Agreement, the Company shall, as expeditiously as practicable:

         (a)  In the case of a Demand Registration, use its best efforts to
prepare and file with the Commission and obtain the effectiveness of a
registration statement on such form as is available for the sale of Registrable
Securities by the Holder in accordance with the plan of distribution set forth
in such registration statement; PROVIDED, HOWEVER, if a request for


                                         -6-

<PAGE>

registration pursuant to Section 1.01 hereof is made within sixty (60) days
before the end of the Company's fiscal year and the Company is not then eligible
to effect a registration under the Securities Act by use of Form S-3 (or other
comparable short-form registration statement), the Company shall be entitled to
delay the filing of such registration statement until the earlier of (i) such
time as the Company receives audited financial statements for such fiscal year
and (ii) the expiration of 90 days after the last day of such fiscal year; and
PROVIDED, FURTHER, that if the Company shall furnish to the Holder a certificate
signed by the President of the Company stating that, in the good faith judgment
of the Board of Directors of the Company, it would be seriously detrimental to
the Company and its stockholders for such registration statement to be filed on
the date filing would be required under this Agreement because such registration
would require premature disclosure of any acquisition, corporate reorganization
or other material transaction involving the Company and that it is therefore
essential to defer taking action with respect to the filing of such registration
statement, then the Company may direct that such request for registration be
delayed for a period not to exceed ninety (90) days, such right to delay a
request to be exercised by the Company not more than once in any 12-month
period.

         (b)  Prepare and file with the Commission such amendments, post-
effective amendments and supplements to such registration statement and the
prospectus used in connection therewith as may be necessary to keep such
registration statement effective for up to ninety (90) days (unless the
Registrable Securities registered thereunder have been sold or disposed of prior
to the expiration of such 90-day period); and to comply with the provisions of
the Securities Act applicable to the Company with respect to the disposition of
all securities covered by such registration statement during such time as such
registration statement is effective.

         (c)  Furnish to the Holder and each underwriter of the Registrable
Securities being sold, as the Holder and such underwriter may reasonably request
in order to facilitate the disposition of Registrable Securities in accordance
with the plan of distribution set forth in such registration statement, (i) such
number of copies (including manually executed and conformed copies) of such
registration statement and of each such amendment thereof and supplement thereto
(including all annexes,


                                         -7-

<PAGE>

appendices, schedules and exhibits), (ii) such number of copies of the
prospectus used in connection with such registration statement (including each
preliminary prospectus and the final prospectus filed pursuant to Rule 424(b)
under the Securities Act), and (iii) such other documents incident thereto.

         (d)  Use its best efforts to register or qualify the Registrable
Securities covered by such registration statement under the securities or "blue
sky" laws of such jurisdictions in which an exemption is not available as the
Holder and the managing underwriter shall reasonably request, and do any and all
other reasonable acts and things which may be necessary or advisable to permit
the offering and disposition of Registrable Securities in such jurisdictions in
accordance with the plan of distribution set forth in the registration
statement; PROVIDED, HOWEVER, the Company shall not be required to qualify
generally to do business as a foreign corporation, subject itself to taxation,
or consent to general service of process, in any jurisdiction wherein it would
not, but for the requirements of this Section 1.03, be obligated to do so.

         (e)  Use its best efforts to cause the Registrable Securities covered
by such registration statement to be registered with, or approved by, such other
public, governmental or regulatory authorities as may be necessary in the
reasonable judgment of counsel for the Holder and the Company to facilitate the
disposition of such Registrable Securities in accordance with the plan of
distribution set forth in such registration statement.

         (f)  Notify the Holder and the managing underwriter, if any, promptly
and, if requested by any such Person, confirm such notification in writing, (i)
when a prospectus or any prospectus supplement has been filed with the
Commission, and, with respect to such registration statement or any post-
effective amendment thereto, when the same has been declared effective by the
Commission, (ii) of any request by the Commission for amendments or supplements
to such registration statement or related prospectus, or any written request by
the Commission for additional information, (iii) of the issuance by the
Commission of any stop order or the receipt of notice of the initiation of any
proceedings for such or a similar purpose (and the Company shall make every
reasonable effort to obtain the withdrawal of any such order at the earliest
possible moment and the Holder shall cooperate in all reasonable respects in
such efforts), (iv)


                                         -8-

<PAGE>

of the receipt by the Company of any notification with respect to the suspension
of the qualification of any of the Registrable Securities for sale in any
jurisdiction or the receipt of notice of the initiation or threatening of any
proceeding for such purpose (and the Company shall make every reasonable effort
to obtain the withdrawal of any such suspension at the earliest possible moment
and the Holder shall cooperate in all reasonable respects in such efforts), (v)
of the occurrence of any event during the period when a prospectus with respect
to the Registrable Securities is required to be delivered under the Securities
Act which requires the making of any changes to such registration statement or
related prospectus so that such documents will not contain any untrue statement
of a material fact or omit to state any material fact required to be stated
therein or necessary to make the statements therein, in light of the
circumstances under which they were made, not misleading (and the Company shall
promptly prepare and furnish to the Holder and any managing underwriter a
reasonable number of copies of a supplemented or amended prospectus or
preliminary prospectus such that, as thereafter delivered to the purchasers of
such Registrable Securities, such prospectus or preliminary prospectus shall not
include an untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state a material fact
required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein, in
light of the circumstances under which they are made, not misleading), and (vi)
of the Company's determination that the filing of a post-effective amendment to
such registration statement shall be necessary or appropriate.  The Holder shall
be deemed to have agreed by its acquisition of Registrable Securities that upon
the receipt of any notice from the Company of the occurrence of any event of the
kind described in clause (v) of this Section 1.03(f), the Holder shall forthwith
discontinue the Holder's offer and disposition of Registrable Securities until
the Holder shall have received copies of an appropriately supplemented or
amended prospectus or preliminary prospectus and, if so directed by the Company,
shall deliver to the Company, at its expense, all copies (other than permanent
file copies) of the prospectus or preliminary prospectus covering such
Registrable Securities which are then in the Holder's possession.  In the event
the Company shall provide any notice of the type referred to in the preceding
sentence, the 90-day period mentioned in Section 1.03(b) hereof shall be
extended by the number of days from and including the date such notice is
provided to and including the date when each seller of any Registrable
Securities covered by such registration statement and the managing underwriter
shall have received copies


                                         -9-

<PAGE>

of the corrected prospectus contemplated by clause (v) of this Section 1.03(f),
plus an additional seven (7) days.  The underwriters or, if there are no
underwriters, the Holder shall deliver such supplemented or amended prospectus
or preliminary prospectus to all purchasers or offerees of the Registrable
Securities sold by it to which such delivery may be required or advisable under
the Securities Act and any applicable state securities or "blue sky" laws.

         (g)  Otherwise use its best efforts in connection with each
registration and offering of Registrable Securities hereunder to comply with all
applicable rules and regulations of the Commission, as the same may hereafter be
amended, including section 11(a) of the Securities Act and Rule 158 thereunder.

         (h)  Use its best efforts to cause all such Registrable Securities
covered by such registration statement to be listed on each securities exchange
on which the same class of securities issued by the Company are then listed, if
the listing of such Registrable Securities is then permitted under the rules and
regulations of such exchange and, if requested by the Holder, cause all such
Registrable Securities that are of a different class or series than those
Company securities already listed or traded to be listed on one (but not more
than one) securities exchange reasonably requested by the Holder.

         (i)  Engage and provide a transfer agent and registrar for all
Registrable Securities covered by such registration statement not later than the
effective date of such registration statement.

         (j)  Furnish to the Holder a signed counterpart of an opinion from
counsel to the Company, and a "cold comfort" letter from the Company's
independent certified public accounting firm covering such matters of the type
customarily covered by such opinions and "cold comfort" letters as any managing
underwriter and the Holder shall reasonably request.

         (k)  Subject to confidentiality restrictions reasonably required by
the Company, at reasonable times and upon reasonable notice, and as necessary to
permit a reasonable investigation with respect to the Company and its business
in connection with the preparation and filing of such registration statement,
make available for inspection by the Holder, by any managing underwriter or
other underwriters participating in any


                                         -10-

<PAGE>

disposition of Registrable Securities, and by any attorney, accountant or other
agent, representative or advisor retained by any such seller or underwriters,
all pertinent financial and other records and corporate documents of the
Company; and cause all of the Company's officers, directors and employees to
discuss pertinent aspects of the Company's business with the Holder and any such
underwriter, accountant, agent, representative or advisor in connection with
such registration statement; PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that the Company shall not be
obligated pursuant to this Section 1.03(k) to provide access to any information
which it reasonably considers to be a trade secret or similar confidential
information.

         (l)  Permit the Holder, if the Holder, in the judgment of its counsel,
might be deemed to be a "control person" of the Company (within the meaning of
section 15 of the Securities Act or section 20 of the Exchange Act), to
participate in the preparation of such registration statement and include
therein material, furnished to the Company in writing which, in the reasonable
judgment of the Holder and its counsel, is required to be included therein; and

         (m)  If any registration statement refers to the Holder by name or
otherwise as the holder of any securities of the Company, and if the Holder
reasonably believes it is or may be deemed to be a control person in relation
to, or an Affiliate of, the Company, then the Holder shall have the right to
require (i) the insertion in such registration statement of language, in form
and substance reasonably satisfactory to the Holder, to the effect that the
ownership by the Holder of such securities is not to be construed as and is not
intended to be a recommendation by the Holder of the investment quality of, or
the relative merits and risks attendant to the purchase of, the Company's
securities covered thereby, and that such ownership does not imply that the
Holder will assist in meeting any future financial or operating requirements of
the Company, or (ii) in the case where the reference to the Holder by name or
otherwise is not required by the Securities Act or any similar federal or state
statute then in effect, the deletion of the reference to the Holder.

    Section 1.04  UNDERWRITTEN OFFERINGS. (a)  REQUESTED UNDERWRITTEN
OFFERINGS.  If requested by the underwriters for any underwritten offering by
the Holder of Registrable Securities pursuant to a Demand Registration, the
Company and the Holder will use their best efforts to enter into an underwriting


                                         -11-

<PAGE>

agreement with such underwriters for such offering, such agreement (i) to be
reasonably satisfactory in substance and form to the Company, the Holder and the
underwriters and (ii) to contain such representations and warranties by the
Company and such other terms as are reasonable and customary in the
circumstances on the part of an issuer in agreements of that type, including,
without limitation, indemnities to the effect and to the extent provided in
Article 2 hereof.  The Holder shall cooperate with the Company in the
negotiation of the underwriting agreement, and shall be party to such
underwriting agreement and may, at its option, require that any or all of the
representations and warranties by, and the other agreements on the part of, the
Company to and for the benefit of such underwriters shall also be made to and
for the benefit of the Holder and that any or all of the conditions precedent to
the obligations of such underwriters under such underwriting agreement be
conditions precedent to the obligations of the Holder.  The Company shall notify
the Holder if at any time the representations and warranties contemplated by
such underwriting agreement cease to be true and correct in all material
respects.  The Holder shall not be required to make any representations or
warranties to or agreements with the Company other than representations,
warranties or agreements regarding the Holder, the Holder's Registrable
Securities and the Holder's intended method of distribution as otherwise
required by law.

         (b)  INCIDENTAL UNDERWRITTEN OFFERINGS.  If the Company proposes to
register any of its securities under the Securities Act as contemplated by
Section 1.02 hereof and such securities are distributed by or through one or
more underwriters, the Holder of Registrable Securities to be distributed by
such underwriters shall be party to the underwriting agreement between the
Company and such underwriters and may, at its option, require that any or all of
the representations and warranties by, and the other agreements on the part of,
the Company to and for the benefit of such underwriters shall also be made to
and for the benefit of the Holder and that any or all of the conditions
precedent to the obligations of such underwriters under such underwriting
agreement be conditions precedent to the obligations of the Holder.  The Company
shall notify the Holder if at any time the representations and warranties
contemplated by such underwriting agreement cease to be true and correct in all
material respects.  The Holder shall not be required to make any representations
or warranties to or agreements with the Company or the underwriters other than
representations, warranties or


                                         -12-

<PAGE>

agreements regarding the Holder, the Holder's Registrable Securities and the
Holder's intended method of distribution or as otherwise required by law.

         (c)  LIMITATIONS ON SALE OR DISTRIBUTION OF OTHER SECURITIES.
Anything herein to the contrary notwithstanding (including Section 1.01(a)
hereof), if the Company shall file a registration statement with respect to any
of the Company's securities, whether or not for its own account, by means of an
underwritten offering, the Holder agrees not to effect any public sale or
distribution of any Registrable Securities, including any resale pursuant to
Rule 144 under the Securities Act, and to use the Holder's best efforts not to
effect any such public sale or distribution (other than as part of such
underwritten offering) of any other securities which, with notice, lapse of time
and/or payment of monies, are exchangeable or exercisable for or convertible
into any Registrable Securities, during the 15-day period prior to, and during
the 120-day period (or such longer period as shall have been requested by the
managing underwriters) commencing on, the effective date of the registration
statement filed with the Commission in connection with such underwritten
offering.

         (d)  In order to ensure compliance with the provisions of Section
1.04(c) hereof, the Company hereby agrees to notify the Holder as to the status
and proposed effective date of any registration statement of the Company which
is filed with the Commission.

         (e)  The Company hereby agrees not to effect, except pursuant to
employee benefit plans, any public sale or distribution of any securities of the
same class as (or otherwise similar to) the Registrable Securities, or any
securities which, with notice, lapse of time and/or payment of monies, are
exchangeable or exercisable for or convertible into any such securities during
the 15-day period prior to, and during the 90-day period commencing on, the
effective date of a registration statement filed with the Commission in
connection with an underwritten offering effected pursuant to Section 1.01 of
this Agreement, except to the extent otherwise required by the CP Agreement, the
BV Agreement or the ProJo Agreement.

         (f)  Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the provisions
of Section 1.04(c) hereof shall not apply to the


                                         -13-

<PAGE>

Holder if the Holder is prevented by statute or other applicable regulation from
agreeing to such provisions.

    Section 1.05   CERTAIN AGREEMENTS OF THE COMPANY AND HOLDER.  (a)  The
Holder, in connection with any registration of Registrable Securities, shall
furnish to the Company such information regarding the Holder and the plan of
distribution proposed by the Holder as the Company may reasonably request and as
shall reasonably be required in connection with any registration, qualification
or compliance referred to in this Agreement.  In the case of a Demand
Registration, the Company agrees that any plan of distribution included in the
registration statement (which plan relates to the Holder) shall be as reasonably
specified by the Holder.

         If requested by the Company, information with respect to the Holder
required, in the opinion of counsel for the Company, to be included pursuant to
the Securities Act in any registration statement or prospectus for an offering
of Registrable Securities shall be furnished to the Company promptly by the
Holder in writing in a form specifically and expressly for use in such
registration statement or prospectus.

         (b)  If at the time of any transfer of any Registrable Securities,
such Registrable Securities shall not have been theretofore registered under the
Securities Act, the Company may require, as a condition of allowing such
transfer, that the Holder or the Holder's transferee furnish to the Company (i)
such information as is necessary in order to establish that such transfer may be
made without registration under the Securities Act; and (ii) at the expense of
the Holder or the Holder's transferee, an opinion of legal counsel designated by
the Holder or the Holder's transferee to the effect that such transfer may be
made without registration under the Securities Act, except that nothing
contained in this Section 1.05(b) shall relieve the Company from complying with
any request for registration, qualification or compliance made pursuant to the
other provisions of this Agreement.

         (c)  The Holder agrees that it will keep confidential and will not
disclose or divulge any confidential, proprietary or secret information that the
Holder may obtain from the Company, and that the Company has marked
"Confidential", "Proprietary" or "Secret" or has otherwise identified as being
such, pursuant to financial information, reports and other materials and


                                         -14-

<PAGE>

discussions with officers, directors, employees or agents made available by the
Company as required hereunder unless such information is or becomes known to the
Holder from a Person other than the Company (other than as a result of a breach
of a duty of confidentiality owed to the Company by such Person) or is or
becomes publicly known other than as a result of a breach of this provision, or
unless the Company gives its written consent to the Holder's release of such
information, except that no such written consent shall be required (and the
Holder shall be free to release such information) if such information is to be
provided to the Holder's counsel or accountant, or to an officer, director,
employee, advisor or partner of the Holder, PROVIDED that the Holder shall
inform the recipient of the confidential nature of such information, and shall
require the recipient to treat the information as confidential to the same
extent as the  Holder.

         (d)  The Holder agrees to perform any further acts and to execute and
deliver any further documents that may reasonably be requested or necessary to
confirm, or to carry out, the provisions of this Agreement (including the
provisions of Article 2 of this Agreement).

                                      ARTICLE 2

                                   INDEMNIFICATION

    Section 2.01  INDEMNIFICATION.  (a)  With respect to each registration of
Registrable Securities pursuant to this Agreement, the Company hereby
indemnifies, to the fullest extent permitted by law, the Holder, its officers
and directors, if any, and each Person, if any, who controls the Holder within
the meaning of section 15 of the Securities Act and section 20 of the Exchange
Act, against all losses, claims, damages, liabilities (or proceedings in respect
thereof) and reasonable expenses (under the Securities Act, common law and
otherwise), joint or several, caused by (i) any untrue statement or alleged
untrue statement of a material fact contained in the applicable registration
statement or prospectus or any omission or alleged omission to state therein a
material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements
therein, in light (in the case of a prospectus) of the circumstances under which
they were made, not misleading, or (ii) any untrue statement or alleged untrue
statement of a material fact contained in any preliminary prospectus or any
omission or alleged omission to


                                         -15-

<PAGE>

state therein a material fact necessary in order to make the statements therein,
in light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading if used
prior to the effective date of such registration statement (unless such
statement or omission is corrected in the final prospectus and the Company has
previously furnished copies thereof to the Holder included in such registration
which is seeking such indemnification and to the underwriters of the
registration in question); PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that such indemnification shall
not extend to any such losses, claims, damages, liabilities (or proceedings in
respect thereof) or expenses which are caused (x) by any untrue statement or
alleged untrue statement contained in, or by any omission or alleged omission
from, information furnished in writing to the Company by the Holder or any
underwriter thereof specifically and expressly for use in any such registration
statement or prospectus or (y) any failure by the Holder or any underwriter to
deliver a prospectus or preliminary prospectus (or amendment or supplement
thereto) as and when required under the Securities Act after such prospectus has
been timely furnished by the Company.

         (b)  In the case of an underwritten offering in which the registration
statement covers Registrable Securities, the Company agrees to indemnify the
underwriters, their officers and directors, if any, and each Person, if any, who
controls such underwriters within the meaning of section 15 of the Securities
Act and section 20 of the Exchange Act, to the extent customary in the
circumstances for an issuer in an underwritten public offering.

         (c)  In connection with any written information furnished to the
Company or any underwriter of any underwritten offering specifically and
expressly for use in a registration statement with respect to the Holder, the
Holder hereby indemnifies severally (but not jointly), to the fullest extent
permitted by law, the Company, its officers and directors and each Person, if
any, who controls the Company within the meaning of section 15 of the Securities
Act and section 20 of the Exchange Act, against any losses, claims, damages,
liabilities (or proceedings in respect thereof) and expenses caused by (i) any
untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of a material fact contained in the
applicable registration statement, prospectus or preliminary prospectus or any
omission or alleged omission to state therein a material fact required to be
stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein, in light (in the
case of a prospectus) of the circumstances under which they


                                         -16-

<PAGE>

were made, not misleading; PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that the indemnification set forth
in this Section 2.01(c) shall only apply if, and the Holder shall be liable
hereunder if and only to the extent that, any such loss, claim, damage or
liability arises solely out of or is based solely upon an untrue statement or
alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission, made in reliance upon
and in conformity with information pertaining to the Holder, which is furnished
in writing to the Company or any underwriter of any underwritten offering by the
Holder expressly for use in any such registration statement or prospectus.

         (d)  In the case of an underwritten offering of Registrable
Securities, the Holder shall agree to indemnify such underwriters, their
officers and directors, if any, and each Person, if any, who controls such
underwriters within the meaning of section 15 of the Securities Act and section
20 of the Exchange Act, to the extent customary in the circumstances for a
selling stockholder in an underwritten public offering.

    Section 2.02  NOTICES OF CLAIMS.   (a)  Any Person seeking indemnification
under the provisions of this Article 2 shall, promptly after receipt by such
Person of notice of the existence of such claim or of the commencement of any
action, suit, claim or proceeding, notify each party against whom
indemnification is to be sought in writing of the existence or commencement
thereof; PROVIDED, HOWEVER, the failure so to notify an indemnifying party shall
not relieve the indemnifying party from any liability which it may have under
this Article 2 or from any liability which the indemnifying party may otherwise
have (except if and to the extent that it has been prejudiced in any material
respect by such failure).  In case any such action, suit, claim or proceeding is
brought against any indemnified party, and it notifies an indemnifying party of
the commencement thereof, the indemnifying party shall be entitled to
participate therein and, to the extent it may elect by written notice delivered
to the indemnified party promptly after receiving the aforesaid notice from such
indemnified party, to assume the defense thereof with counsel reasonably
satisfactory to such indemnified party, except as otherwise provided in Section
2.02(c) hereof.  Upon delivery of such notice by the Company (if it is the
indemnifying party) to such indemnified party and approval of such counsel by
such indemnified party, the Company will not be liable under this Article 2 for
any legal or other expenses subsequently incurred by the Holder in connection
with the defense of such action,


                                         -17-

<PAGE>

suit, claim or proceeding, except as otherwise provided in Section 2.02(b)
hereof.

         (b)  Notwithstanding the foregoing, the indemnified party shall have
the right to employ its own counsel in any such case, but the fees and expenses
of such counsel shall be at the expense of such indemnified party unless (i) the
employment of such counsel shall have been authorized in writing by the
indemnifying party in connection with the defense of such suit, action, claim or
proceeding, (ii) the indemnifying party shall not have employed counsel
(reasonably satisfactory to the indemnified party) to take charge of the defense
of such action, suit, claim or proceeding within a reasonable time after notice
of commencement of the action, suit, claim or proceeding, or (iii) such
indemnified party shall have reasonably concluded that there may be defenses
available to it which are different from or additional to those available to the
indemnifying party which, if the indemnifying party and the indemnified party
were to be represented by the same counsel, could result in a conflict of
interest for such counsel or materially prejudice the prosecution of the
defenses available to such indemnified party.  If any of the events specified in
clauses (ii) or (iii) of the preceding sentence shall have occurred or such
clauses shall otherwise be applicable, then the fees and expenses of one counsel
or firm of counsel, plus one local or regulatory counsel or firm of counsel,
selected by a majority in interest of the indemnified parties shall be borne by
the indemnifying party.

         (c)  If, in any case, the indemnified party employs separate counsel,
the indemnifying party shall not have the right to direct the defense of such
action, suit, claim or proceeding on behalf of the indemnified party.

         (d)  Anything in this Article 2 to the contrary notwithstanding, an
indemnifying party shall not be liable for any settlement or compromise of, or
consent to entry of any judgment with respect to, any action, suit, claim or
proceeding effected without its prior written consent (which consent in the case
of an action, suit, claim or proceeding exclusively seeking monetary relief
shall not be unreasonably withheld).  Such indemnification shall remain in full
force and effect irrespective of any investigation made by or on behalf of an
indemnified party.

    Section 2.03  CONTRIBUTION.  (a)  If the indemnification from the
indemnifying party as provided in this Article 2 is unavailable or is otherwise
insufficient to hold harmless an indemnified party in respect of any losses,
claims, damages, liabilities or expenses referred to therein, then the
indemnifying party shall, to the fullest extent permitted by law, contribute to
the amount paid or payable by such indemnified party as a result of such losses,
claims, damages, liabilities or expenses in such proportion as is appropriate to
reflect the relative fault of the indemnifying party and indemnified parties in
connection with the actions which resulted in such losses, claims, damages,
liabilities or expenses, as well as any other relevant equitable considerations,
subject to the provisions of Section 2.03(b) hereof.  The relative fault of such
indemnifying party shall be determined by reference to, among other things,
whether any action in question, including any untrue or alleged untrue statement
of a material fact or omission or alleged omission to state a material fact, has
been made, or relates to information supplied by such indemnifying party, and
the parties, relative intent, knowledge, access to information and opportunity
to correct or prevent such action.  The amount paid or payable by a party as a
result of the losses, claims, damages, liabilities and expenses referred to
above shall be deemed to include, subject to the limitations set forth in
Section 2.02 hereof, any legal or other fees or expenses reasonably incurred by
such party in connection with any investigation or proceeding.  The parties
hereto agree that it would not be just and equitable if contribution pursuant to
this Article 2 were determined by pro rata allocation or by any other method of
allocation which does not take account of the equitable considerations referred
to in this Section 2.03(a).  Notwithstanding the provisions of this Section
2.03, no underwriter shall be required to contribute any amount in excess of the
amount by which the total price at which the Registrable Securities underwritten
by it and offered to the public exceeds the amount of any damages for which such
underwriter has otherwise been held liable by reason of such untrue statement or
alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission; and the Holder shall
not be required to contribute any amount in excess of the amount by which the
total price at which the Registrable Securities offered to the public exceeds
the amount of any damages for which the Holder has otherwise been held liable by
reason of such untrue statement or alleged untrue statement or omission or
alleged omission.


                                         -19-

<PAGE>

         (b)  No Person guilty of fraudulent misrepresentation (within the
meaning of section 11(f) of the Securities Act) shall be entitled to
contribution from any Person who was not guilty of such fraudulent
misrepresentation.

         (c)  If indemnification is available under this Article 2, the
indemnifying parties shall indemnify each indemnified party to the fullest
extent provided in Section 2.01 and Section 2.02 hereof without regard to the
relative fault of said indemnifying party or indemnified party or any other
equitable consideration provided for in this Section 2.03.

    Section 2.04  INDEMNIFICATION PAYMENTS.  The indemnification and
contribution required by this Article 2 shall be made by periodic payments of
the amount thereof during the course of the investigation or defense, as and
when bills are received or expense, loss, damage or liability is incurred.

                                      ARTICLE 3

entire agreement and understanding among the parties hereto with respect to the
subject matter hereof and supersedes any and all prior oral and written
agreements, arrangements and understandings among the parties hereto with

reference to this Agreement signed by the Company and the Holder.

    Section 4.05  PARAGRAPH HEADINGS, ETC.  The paragraph headings contained in
this Agreement are for general reference purposes only and shall not affect in

    Section 4.06  APPLICABLE LAW.  This Agreement shall be governed by,

performed wholly within such state and, in any case, without regard to the
conflicts of law principles of such state.

    Section 4.07  SEVERABILITY.  If at any time subsequent to the date hereof,
any provision of this Agreement shall be held by any court of competent
jurisdiction to be illegal, void or


                                         -25-

<PAGE>

unenforceable, such provision shall be of no force and effect, but the
illegality or unenforceability of such provision shall have no effect upon and
shall not impair the enforceability of any other provision of this Agreement.

    Section 4.08  EQUITABLE REMEDIES.  The parties hereto agree that
irreparable harm would occur in the event that any of the agreements and
provisions of this Agreement were not performed fully by the parties hereto in
accordance with their specific terms or conditions or were otherwise breached,
and that money damages are an inadequate remedy for breach of this Agreement
because of the difficulty of ascertaining and quantifying the amount of damage
that will be suffered by the parties hereto in the event that this Agreement is
not performed in accordance with its terms or conditions or is otherwise
breached.  It is accordingly hereby agreed that the parties hereto shall be
entitled to an injunction or injunctions to restrain, enjoin and prevent
breaches of this Agreement by the other parties and to enforce specifically the

having jurisdiction, such remedy being in addition to and not in lieu of, any
other rights and remedies to which the other parties are entitled to at law or
in equity.

    Section 4.09  NO WAIVER.  The failure of any party at any time or times to
require performance of any provision hereof shall not affect the right at a
later time to enforce the same.  No waiver by any party of any condition, and no
breach of any provision, term, covenant, representation or warranty contained in
this Agreement, whether by conduct or otherwise, in any one or more instances,
shall be deemed to be construed as a further or continuing waiver of any such
condition or of the breach of any other provision, term, covenant,
representation or warranty of this Agreement.

    Section 4.10  COUNTERPARTS.  This Agreement may be executed in two or more
counterparts, each of which shall be deemed an original, but all of which
together shall constitute but one and the same original instrument.

Anything in this Agreement to the contrary notwithstanding:


                                         -26-

number of shares (adjusted appropriately downward or upward to reflect any stock
dividends, splits, combinations, exchange, reorganization, recapitalization or
reclassification involving Class A Common Stock of the Company or pursuant to a
merger or consolidation or similar transaction involving the Company or the like
after the date hereof) of Registrable Securities issuable at the date hereof
upon conversion of the Preferred Securities.

and each of the other transactions contemplated thereby and any action required

fiduciary duties as a director of the Company.

            In furtherance of the foregoing, (i) each Stockholder hereby

            5.4  COUNTERPARTS.  This Agreement may be executed in one or more

            5.5  APPLICABLE LAW.  This Agreement shall be governed by, and
construed in accordance with, the laws of the State of Delaware without
reference to choice of law principles, including all matters of construction,
validity and performance.

            5.6  SEVERABILITY; ENFORCEMENT.  The invalidity of any portion
hereof shall not affect the validity, force or effect of the remaining portions
hereof.  If it is ever held that any restriction hereunder is too broad to
permit enforcement of such restriction to its fullest extent, each party agrees
that a court of competent jurisdiction may enforce such restriction to the
maximum extent permitted by law, and each party hereby consents and agrees that
such scope may be judicially modified accordingly in any proceeding brought to
enforce such restriction.  In furtherance of the foregoing, if any court
construes any of the provisions of Section 3.6, or any part thereof, to be
unreasonable because of the duration of such provision or the geographic scope
thereof, such court shall have the power to reduce the duration or restrict the
geographic


                                        16

scope of such provision and to enforce such provision as so reduced or
restricted.

deliver such additional documents as may be necessary or desirable to consummate
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

            5.8  PARTIES IN INTEREST; ASSIGNMENT.  Neither this Agreement nor
any of the rights, interest or obligations hereunder shall be assigned by any of
the parties hereto without the prior written consent of the other parties.

            5.9  ENTIRE AGREEMENT.  This Agreement and the Merger Agreement
and the Transaction Documents contain the entire understanding of the parties
hereto and thereto with respect to the subject matter contained herein and
therein, and supersede and cancel all prior agreements, negotiations,
correspondence, undertakings and communications of the parties, oral or written,
respecting such subject matter.  There are no restrictions, promises,
representations, warranties, agreements or undertakings of any party hereto or
to the Merger Agreement or any of the Transaction Documents with respect to the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement and the Merger Agreement and the
Transaction Documents other than those set forth herein or therein or made
hereunder or thereunder.

            5.10  SPECIFIC PERFORMANCE.  The parties hereto agree that the
remedy at law for any breach of this Agreement will be inadequate and that any
party by whom this Agreement is enforceable shall be entitled to specific
performance in addition to any other appropriate relief or remedy.  Such party
may, in its sole discretion, apply to a court of competent jurisdiction for
specific performance or injunctive or such other relief as such court may deem
just and proper in order to enforce this Agreement or prevent any violation
hereof and, to the extent permitted by applicable law, each party waives any
objection to the imposition of such relief.

All years have been restated to exclude the Capital Assets segment which was
discontinued as of June 1, 1993.

The 1993 ratio is based on earnings from continuing operations before
extraordinary charges associated with the decision to discontinue accounting for
the operations of the Company in accordance with SFAS No. 71 of $3,123 and the
early extinguishment of debt of $77. The 1993 and 1991 ratios include
restructuring charges of $1,000 and $364, respectively. Excluding the
restructuring charges the 1993 and 1991 ratios of earnings to fixed charges
would have been 4.22 and 3.75, respectively.

The 1992 ratio is based on earnings before the cummulative effect of change in
accounting principles which reduced net income by  $1,793.
