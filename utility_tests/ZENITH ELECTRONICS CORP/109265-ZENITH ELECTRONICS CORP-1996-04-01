                                  PART I


ITEM 1. BUSINESS

The company was founded in 1918 and has been a leader in consumer 
electronics, first in radio and later in monochrome and color television 
and other video products.  The company's operations involve a dominant 
industry segment, the design, development, and manufacture and 
marketing of video products (including color TV sets and other consumer 
products) along with parts and accessories for such products.  These 
products, along with purchased VCRs, are sold principally to retail 
dealers in the United States and Canada and to retail dealers and 
wholesale distributors in other foreign countries.  The company also sells 
directly to buying groups, private label customers and customers in the 
lodging, health care and rent-to-own industries.  The company's video 
products also include color picture tubes that are produced for and sold to 
other manufacturers and Network Systems products, such as cable and 
telecommunication set-top devices, interactive TV and data 
communication products which are sold primarily to cable TV operators 
and other commercial users of these products.
    The company has sold or downsized its non-core business 
activities.  The company sold its monochrome video monitor business in 
1993 and its power supply business in 1994.  Its activities in color video 
monitors sold to computer manufacturers ceased in 1995 and its activities 
in high-security electronic equipment have been discontinued.
    The company has incurred losses in all but one of the years since 
1985.  These results reflected the cumulative effect of frequent and 
significant color TV price reductions during the 1980s and 1990s, and 
also reflected earlier recessionary conditions in the United States.  In 
addition, the company has invested significant amounts in engineering and 
research in recent years, which amounts have been expensed as incurred.
    On November 8, 1995, a change in control of the company 
occurred, in which LG Electronics, Inc., a corporation organized under the 
laws of the Republic of Korea ("LGE"), purchased shares of the company 
pursuant to a combined tender offer and purchase of newly issued shares 
of common stock from the company. After giving effect to the 
transactions, LGE is the beneficial owner of 36,569,000 shares of 
common stock of the company which represents approximately 57.7 
percent of the outstanding common stock.

Raw Materials
Many materials, such as copper, plastic, steel, wood, glass, aluminum and 
zinc, are essential to the business.  Adequate sources of supply exist for 
these materials.

Patents
The company is licensed under a number of patents which are of 
importance to its business, and holds numerous patents.  The company 
has patents and patent applications for numerous high-definition TV 
("HDTV") related inventions.  To the extent these inventions are 
incorporated into the HDTV standard to be adopted by the Federal 
Communications Commission, the company expects to receive royalties 
from these patents.  In addition, royalties have been and may be received 
from these patents for non-HDTV applications as well.  In addition, major 
manufacturers of TV sets and VCRs agreed during 1992 to take licenses 
under some of the company's U.S. tuning system patents (the licenses 
expire in 2003).  Based on 1995 U.S. industry unit sales levels and 
technology, more than $25 million in annual royalty income is expected 
through the licensing period. While in the aggregate its patents and 
licenses are valuable, the business of the company is not materially 
dependent on them.

Seasonal Variations in Business
Sales of the company's consumer electronics products are generally at a 
higher level during the second half of the year.  Sales of consumer 
electronics products typically increase in the fall, as the summer vacation 
season ends and people spend more time indoors with the new fall 
programming on TV and during the Christmas holiday season.  During 
1995, 1994 and 1993, 57 percent, 59 percent and 54 percent, respectively, 
of the company's net sales were recorded in the second half of the year and 
approximately 30 percent of the company's net sales were recorded in the 
fourth quarter of each of the three years ended December 31, 1995.

Major Customer
Sales to a single customer amounted to $172.1 million (14 percent of total 
sales) in 1995 and $180.8 million (12 percent of total sales) in 1994. No 
other customer accounted for 10 percent or more of net sales.

Competitive Conditions
Competitive factors in North America include price, performance, quality, 
variety of products and features offered, marketing and sales capabilities, 
manufacturing costs, and service and support.  The company believes it 
competes well with respect to each of these factors.
    The company's major product areas, including the color TV 
market, are highly competitive.  The company's major competitors are 
significantly larger foreign-owned companies, generally with greater 
worldwide TV volume and overall resources.  In efforts to increase market 
share or achieve higher production volumes, the company's competitors 
have aggressively lowered their selling prices in the past several years.

Research and Development
During 1995 expenditures for company-sponsored engineering and 
research relating to new products and services and to improvements of 
existing products and services amounted to $43.6 million.  Amounts 
expended in 1994 and 1993 were $45.4 million and $47.8 million, 
respectively.

Environmental Matters
Compliance with Federal, State and local environmental protection 
provisions is not expected to have a material effect on capital 
expenditures, earnings or the competitive position of the company.  
Further information regarding environmental compliance is set forth under 
Item 3 of this report.

Number of Employees
At the end of December 1995, the company employed approximately 
18,100 people, of whom approximately 13,100 are hourly workers 
covered by collective bargaining agreements.  Approximately 4,600 of the 
company's employees are located in the Chicago, Illinois, area, of whom 
approximately 3,000 are represented by unions.  Approximately 13,200 of 
the company's employees are located in Mexico, of whom approximately 
10,100 are represented by unions.  Mexican labor contracts expire every 
two years and wages are renegotiated annually or more frequently under 
rapid devaluation or high inflation periods. The company believes that its 
relations with its employees are good.

Financial Information about Foreign and Domestic Operations and Export Sales
The North American Free Trade Agreement ("NAFTA"), which took 
effect on January 1, 1994, significantly reduced duty costs in 1995 and 
1994.  NAFTA also improved the company's ability to compete against 
imports in North America and increased sales of the company's color TV 
sets in Canada and in Mexico during 1994 and in Canada during 1995.
    Information regarding foreign operations is included in "Note Six 
- - Geographic Segment Data" on page 29 of this report.  Export sales are 
less than 10% of consolidated net sales.
    The company's product lines are dependent on the continuing 
operations of the company's manufacturing and assembly facilities located 
in Mexico.



ITEM 2. PROPERTIES

The company utilizes a total of approximately 5.6 million square feet for 
manufacturing, warehousing, engineering and research, administration and 
distribution, as described below.

and anticipated requirements.  None of the real property owned by the 
company is mortgaged


ITEM 3.  LEGAL PROCEEDINGS

The company is involved in various legal actions, environmental matters, 
and other proceedings relating to a wide range of matters that are 
incidental to the conduct of its business.  The company believes, after 
reviewing such matters with the company's counsel, that any liability 
which may ultimately be incurred with respect to these matters is not 
expected to have a material effect on either the company's consolidated 
financial position or results of operations.
    In October 1989, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency 
("EPA") filed a civil action against certain generator and owner/operator 
defendants under the Comprehensive Environmental Response, 
Compensation, and Liabilities Act of 1980 ("CERCLA"), seeking 
reimbursement for the EPA's response costs in connection with an 
environmental cleanup at a site known as Moyer Landfill located at 
Collegeville, Pennsylvania.  One of the original defendants to the EPA 
case brought a third party action for contribution against a number of 
third party defendants, including Ford Electronics and Refrigeration 
Corporation ("FERCO").  FERCO sought $600,000 in contribution from 
the company on the ground that FERCO is being held liable in part 
because it hauled certain waste from the company's former Lansdale, 
Pennsylvania picture tube plant.  The company recently entered into an 
agreement with FERCO and agreed to contribute $300,000 toward a 
settlement with the federal government and the Commonwealth of 
Pennsylvania, subject to negotiation of an acceptable consent decree. 
    Numerous lawsuits against major computer and peripheral 
equipment manufacturers are pending in the U.S. District Court, Eastern 
District of New York, the U.S. District Court of New Jersey and the New 
York State courts, as well as other federal courts.  These lawsuits seek 
several billion dollars in damages from various defendants for repetitive 
stress injuries claimed to have been caused by the use of word processor 
equipment.  The company has been named as a defendant in twenty-seven 
of these cases which relate to keyboards allegedly manufactured by the 
company for its former subsidiary, Zenith Data Systems Corporation.  
Plaintiffs in the company's cases seek to recover $31 million actual and 
$321 million punitive damages from the company.  The company believes 
it has meritorious defenses to the cases.
    The company was served with summons and complaint in an 
action entitled Linn-Faysville Aquifer Preservation Association, et al v. 
Republic Waste Industries, Inc., et al. No. C-4430-95F, filed August 31, 
1995, in the state court, Hidalgo County, Texas.  The suit alleges that the 
company and others had contaminated groundwater that has the potential 
to enter and contaminate an aquifer by, in the case of the company and 
several of the other defendants, dumping hazardous wastes from their 
maquiladoras at a landfill in Edinberg, Texas.  Plaintiffs are an 
association and a number of individuals.  Defendants are the 
owner/operators of the landfill and alleged "dumpers."  Unspecified 
damages are sought for a variety of alleged harms to persons and 
property.  In addition, the plaintiffs seek the cleanup and closing of the 
landfill.  Discovery is ongoing.  A trial date has not yet been set.
    On June 27, 1995, the EPA sent a letter notifying the company 
that it was one of the potentially responsible parties under Section 107(a) 
of CERCLA, with respect to the North Penn Area Seven Superfund Site 
in Lansdale, Montgomery County, Pennsylvania.  Hazardous substances 
consisting of volatile organic material ("VOM") were discovered in the 
aquifer.  The company does not believe that it has contributed to the 
contamination.  At this time, the company has no knowledge of the extent 
of the contamination or the cost of cleanup.
    In June 1992, the company retained an environmental consultant 
to conduct a survey of its air emission sources and to test for VOM 
emissions at its picture tube facility in Melrose Park, Illinois.  The survey 
disclosed that the company needed certain additional operating permits 
from the Illinois EPA relating to air emission sources and needed to 
comply with certain federal and state air quality regulations regarding 
VOM emissions.  The company promptly reported the results of the 
survey to the Illinois EPA and to the EPA.  The company retained an 
environmental engineering firm to complete installation of pollution 
control equipment to address the emissions.  The capital costs for 
installing appropriate capture and control equipment was $600,000 and 
the company installed the equipment in 1995.  In 1995, the Illinois 
Attorney General sent the company a penalty demand for $1.4 million, 
which demand was subsequently reduced to $660,000.  The company is 
contesting the penalty.
    On December 6, 1995, the company received notice that it has 
been named as a third-party defendant in a contribution action entitled SC 
Holdings, Inc. v. A.A.A. Realty Co., et al, U.S. District Court, District of 
New Jersey, Civil Action No. 95-947(GEB), filed November 30, 1995.  
The company is one of over 100 parties involved in this litigation.  The 
litigation concerns the Cinnaminson Groundwater Contamination Site 
located in the Township of Cinnaminson in Burlington County, New 
Jersey.  The site is a former sanitary landfill.  The EPA has designated the 
site a "Superfund" site and has placed the site on the National Priorities 
List.  Very little information is available at this time.  However, there is 
an allegation that the company disposed of 40 drums of solvents at the 
site.  The facility that allegedly generated the solvents was not identified.  
The company has answered the complaint and is attempting to obtain 
more specific information from third-party plaintiffs.
    In 1994, the company notified its 15 independent distributors of 
its intent to change to direct-to-retail distribution on a nationwide basis 
during 1995. In February 1995, one of the independent distributors filed 
suit challenging the company's right to discontinue the distributorship 
relationship and alleging that it had been damaged by certain of the 
company's practices. The lawsuit sought injunctive relief, actual damages 
of $8 million and punitive damages of $20 million. In October 1995 
summary judgment dismissing the case on all counts was entered. The 
plaintiff has filed notice of appeal. Another suit arising in connection with 
this change in distribution was filed in April 1995 by another independent 
distributor. The lawsuit seeks approximately $13 million in damages 
under the Wisconsin Fair Dealership Law. In January 1996 the court 
denied the company's motion for summary judgment and granted the 
plaintiff's motion for summary judgment, finding the company is liable. A 
jury trial setting the amount of the plaintiff's damages, if any, is expected 
in April 1996.
    In July 1995, plaintiff Gwynne L. Horwits, SEP IRA, filed a 
purported class action in the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware 
in and for New Castle County against the company, its directors and LG 
Electronics Inc. (LGE) alleging that the company's directors breached 
their fiduciary duties and failed to exercise loyalty, good faith, due care 
and complete disclosure toward the company and the stockholders of the 
company in connection with the LGE acquisition of a controlling interest 
in the company.  The company, the members of the board of directors, and 
LGE denied, and continue to deny, that they committed any violations of 
law or breaches of duty as alleged in the complaint, but entered a 
memorandum of understanding and a stipulation of settlement solely 
because a proposed settlement would eliminate the burden and expense of 
further litigation and facilitated the consummation of the proposed 
transaction with LGE.  In agreeing to disclose additional information, the 
company does not admit the materiality of that information or that the 
materials previously filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission 
were in any way deficient.  In connection with the proposed settlement, it 
is anticipated that counsel for the plaintiff will apply to the court for an 
aggregate award of attorneys' fees and expenses in an amount not to 
exceed $300,000.  As a condition of settlement, the company has agreed 
to pay plaintiff's counsel the amount awarded by the court, up to 
$300,000.  Before the proposed settlement is finally approved by the 
court, notice of the proposed terms and conditions of the settlement will be 
mailed to all members of any class certified by the court, who will be 
afforded an opportunity to opt out of and object to the settlement.


ITEM 4.  SUBMISSION OF MATTERS TO A VOTE OF SECURITY HOLDERS

A special meeting of stockholders of the company was held on November 
7, 1995, to approve a Stock Purchase Agreement, dated as of July 17,

ITEM 7.  MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION
         AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

RESULTS OF OPERATIONS
- ---------------------

The statements of consolidated operations summarize operating results for 
the last three years. This section of Management's Discussion and 
Analysis highlights the main factors affecting the changes in operating 
results during the three-year period.

Revenues  
Sales were $1,274 million in 1995, a decrease of 13 percent 
from 1994. Sales in 1994 were $1,469 million, an increase of 20 percent 
over 1993 sales of $1,228 million.
    The company's core business - the development, manufacture 
and distribution of a broad range of products for the delivery of video 
entertainment - is composed of two major product areas, Consumer 
Electronics (which includes color picture tube operations) and Network 
Systems. 
    In Consumer Electronics, the color TV market remains extremely 
competitive. Consumer Electronics sales decreased 14 percent in 1995 
from 1994 primarily due to lower selling prices, soft domestic demand for 
direct-view color TV sets, reduced VCR revenues (partially due to a 
change in distribution method) and significantly lower color TV unit sales 
in Mexico, due to the December 1994 devaluation of the Mexican peso.
    Price competition continued during 1995 forcing the company to 
reduce color TV prices by $66 million from 1994 to maintain sales 
volumes and market share. The company expects continued erosion in 
domestic color TV selling prices during 1996 mainly due to persisting 
competition for market share and excess industry inventories. This price 
competition may continue to adversely affect the company's performance. 
    As a result of soft industry conditions during 1995, particularly 
during the traditionally strong fourth quarter, domestic industry color TV 
unit sales to dealers (including projection television) decreased by 4 
percent to 26.2 million units (following increases of 10 percent to 27.4 
million units in 1994 and 11 percent to 25.0 million units in 1993). While 
it remains one of the top three U.S. color TV brands, the company's 
market share declined slightly during 1995 due to slow shipments early in 
the first quarter caused by start-up problems associated with a new 
finished-goods warehouse. The company expects that industry color TV 
unit sales to dealers will continue to decline somewhat in 1996.
    In Mexico, the company's and industry TV sales to dealers were 
curtailed in 1995 due to devaluation of the peso. The value of the peso 
appears to have stabilized, and management expects a gradual recovery in 
demand for color TV sets in Mexico.
    The North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA), which 
took effect on January 1, 1994, helped to increase sales of the company's 
color TV sets in Canada and in Mexico during 1994 and in Canada during 
1995.
    During 1994, Consumer Electronics sales increased by 25 percent 
over 1993, due primarily to higher unit volume and despite lower product 
pricing of $46 million. The company's unit sales increase in 1994 was 
significantly higher than the industry growth rate, indicating a rise in 
market share. The company's sales increases were especially strong in key 
industry growth categories, such as projection and large-screen TV 
models and TV-VCR combination products. The company's sales growth 
in VCRs in 1994 exceeded the industry's sales growth rate of 6 percent.
    In color picture tube operations, NAFTA contributed to continued 
strong demand for the company's domestically-produced color picture 
tubes. Sales of picture tubes to other manufacturers increased 33 percent 
in 1995 from 1994, and the number of units sold was up 29 percent. Sales 
of picture tubes increased 20 percent in 1994 from 1993, and the number 
of units sold was up 12 percent.
    In Network Systems, which includes the design and manufacture 
of set-top boxes and data modems sold primarily to the cable TV industry, 
sales increased 12 percent in 1995 from 1994, reflecting the continuing 
strength of the industry and the popularity of the company's high-
performance analog set-top units. Sales also were aided by a multi-
million-dollar agreement with the Malaysian pay television operation 
Mega TV to provide as many as 200,000 wireless cable decoders. The 
company anticipates that the analog set-top market will continue to grow 
in 1996.
    During 1994, Network Systems sales increased by 38 percent 
over 1993, reflecting benefits of reorganization and new product 
development, as well as an improved industry environment.
    Sales of non-core products, primarily power supplies and display 
monitors, decreased by 77 percent in 1995 from 1994, to less than 1 
percent of total sales. These businesses were phased out or sold during 
1994, although the company continued to manufacture power supplies for 
the purchaser of the magnetics business until April 1995.
    During 1994, sales of non-core products decreased by 72 percent 
over 1993 as the company eliminated non-core operations. During the 
year, production of both monochrome and color monitors ceased.

Costs and Expenses  
In light of the company's net losses, the competitive 
environment and inflationary cost pressures, the company has undertaken 
major cost reduction programs in each of the last three years, generating 
savings of approximately $75 million in 1995, $40 million in 1994 and 
$75 million in 1993. These programs included cost control and profit 
improvement initiatives; design, manufacturing, logistics and distribution 
improvements; and business consolidations. The company continues to 
seek ongoing additional cost reduction opportunities; however, there can 
be no assurance that any such cost reductions will be achieved. The 
Mexican peso devaluation, which began in December 1994, lowered peso-
denominated costs - including wages and salaries, utilities, supplies and 
materials - by approximately $36 million in 1995. In addition, NAFTA 
regulations reduced duty costs by $19 million in 1994 over 1993. These 
cost savings were offset by inflationary increases for purchased material 
and labor costs (Mexican labor contracts expire every two years and 
wages are renegotiated annually or more frequently under rapid 
devaluation or high inflation periods). These inflationary increases totaled 
$43 million in 1995, $22 million in 1994 and $20 million in 1993.
    Selling, general and administrative expenses were $118 million in 
1995, $117 million in 1994 and $93 million in 1993. These expenses as a 
percent of revenues were 9 percent in 1995 and 8 percent in 1994 and 
1993. In 1995, as compared to 1994, the amount of these expenses was 
constant but the decline in sales caused the ratio to increase. In 1994, as 
compared to 1993, these expenses increased primarily due to increased 
advertising costs in the United States and Mexico in support of the higher 
sales volume.
    Amounts that the company spends each year on engineering and 
research relating to new products and services and to improvements of 
existing products and  services are expensed as incurred. These amounts 
were $44 million in 1995, $45 million in 1994 and $48 million in 1993. 
These expenses as a percentage of revenues were 3 percent in 1995 and 
1994, and 4 percent in 1993.

Other Operating Expense (Income)  
Other operating expense (income) is primarily composed of royalty 
income received from manufacturers of TV sets and VCRs who have taken 
licenses under some of the company's U.S. tuning system patents. Royalty 
income from tuning system patents was $26 million in 1995, $28 million 
in 1994 and $26 million in 1993. Also included in Other operating 
expense (income) are foreign exchange gains and losses. These amounts 
have traditionally not been material, but in 1994 the company recorded $4 
million of foreign exchange gain, mainly as a result of the Mexican peso 
devaluation.

Restructuring and Other Charges  
During 1995, the company recorded $22 million of Restructuring and other 
charges. The main component of this was a second-quarter charge of 
$18 million primarily to restructure its core Consumer Electronics and 
Network Systems business. The charge was primarily composed of provisions 
made in anticipation of cash expenditures that were paid in the 
second half of 1995 or will be paid in the first half of 1996. The major 
elements of the restructuring related to severance expenses ($10 million) 
associated with employment reductions (mostly in the company's U.S. 
salaried workforce) and costs associated with realigned distribution 
activities ($3 million) as the company changed to direct-to-retail 
distribution on a nationwide basis. The remaining charges related to 
other non-recurring items, including certain environmental, legal and other 
regulatory matters, along with trade receivable write-offs (primarily for 
accounts in Mexico as a result of the peso devaluation). The reduction in 
the salaried workforce, together with other initiatives, are expected to 
reduce annual costs by about $20 million.
    The remainder of the 1995 charges related to fourth-quarter 
charges totaling $4 million that were incurred as a consequence of the LG 
Electronics, Inc. (LGE) purchase of common stock.  
    During 1993, the company recorded $31 million of Restructuring 
and other charges. This was driven by a fourth-quarter charge primarily to 
restructure certain product areas and re-engineer its core business. The 
restructuring affected computer monitors and magnetics, product areas 
that were phased out or sold in 1994. Major elements of this charge were 
the non-cash writedown of fixed assets and inventory ($23 million) as well 
as re-engineering and severance costs ($6 million) that were substantially 
paid during 1994. As expected, the restructuring actions reduced 1994 
compensation expense by approximately $10 million and reduced 
depreciation expense by approximately $4 million. No material changes 
have occurred or are anticipated in these programs or in the estimated 
costs or benefits of the programs.

Gain (Loss) on Asset Sales  
In 1995, the company realized a loss of $2 million related to various 
property sale transactions. During 1994 the company realized a gain of $11 
million on asset sales, including more than 3 million square feet of excess 
plant and office space, 98 acres of vacant land, and assets related to the 
magnetics business. There were no material property sales during 1993.

Interest Expense  
The $4 million increase in interest expense in 1995 resulted 
from higher funding requirements (at higher interest rates) for 
company operations. To assist in funding these requirements, the company 
entered into a $40 million Term Loan Agreement in May 1995. Interest 
expense between 1994 and 1993 was relatively constant.

Income Taxes  
In 1995, the company recorded an income tax credit of $8 million 
(including interest) that related to a tax refund due the company as 
a result of certain foreign tax credit issues in audits of prior years. Due 
to the company's continuing losses there have been essentially no provisions 
made for income taxes during the last three years.

Net Income  
As a result of the factors described above, net losses were $92 
million in 1995, $14 million in 1994 and $97 million in 1993. 
Corresponding losses per share were $1.88 in 1995, $.34 in 1994 and 
$3.01 in 1993.
    Market prices for color TV sets in the beginning of 1996 were 
substantially lower than a year ago and pricing is not expected to improve 
during the rest of the year. The company selectively reduced color TV 
prices in February 1996 in order to maintain market share. Although the 
company continues to seek more than $75 million in additional cost 
reduction opportunities for 1996, the decline in color TV pricing along 
with inflationary cost pressures are expected to have a negative impact on 
the company's financial results for 1996.

CASH FLOWS
- ----------

The statements of consolidated cash flows reflect the changes in cash for 
the last three years by classifying transactions into three major categories; 
Operating, Investing and Financing activities.

Operating Activities  
A principal use of the company's liquidity is the cash used by 
operating activities which consists of the company's net loss 
as adjusted for non-cash operating items and the changes in current assets 
and liabilities such as receivables, inventories and payables.
    In 1995, $33 million of cash was used by operating activities 
principally to fund $59 million of net losses from operations as adjusted 
for depreciation and a loss on asset sales. A decrease in current accounts 
provided $22 million of cash and was principally composed of a $53 
million decrease in inventories offset by a $38 million decrease in 
accounts payable and accrued expenses. The decreases in inventories and 
accounts payable were due in part to lower levels of color TV production 
caused by lower sales levels. Inventories also were reduced as a result of 
process improvements implemented during 1995.
    In 1994, $42 million of cash was used by operating activities 
primarily to fund a $52 million change in current accounts offset by $4 
million in net income from operations as adjusted for depreciation and 
gains on the sales of assets. The change in current accounts was composed 
primarily of a $46 million increase in receivables (due to higher sales) and 
a $43 million increase in inventories (due mainly to increased levels of 
color television production in support of higher sales), partially offset by a 
$40 million increase in accounts payable and accrued expenses. In 
addition, the company reduced cash used by operating activities by issuing 
common stock to the profit-sharing retirement plans to fulfill the 1994 
obligation to salaried employees and some hourly employees. This 
issuance increased stockholders' equity by $6 million. 
    In 1993, $28 million of cash was used by operating activities 
principally to fund $45 million of net losses from operations as adjusted 
for depreciation and fixed asset writedowns as a part of restructuring. A 
decrease in current accounts provided $3 million of cash and was 
composed of a $15 million decrease in receivables offset by an $8 million 
increase in inventories and a $4 million decrease in accounts payable and 
accrued expenses. The decrease in receivables was due to lower sales. 
Also, the company reduced cash used by operating activities by issuing 
common stock to the profit-sharing retirement plans to fulfill both the 
1992 obligation to salaried employees and the 1993 obligation to salaried 
employees and some hourly employees. These issuances increased 
stockholders' equity by $15 million. 

Investing Activities  
The principal recurring investing activity is the addition of 
property, plant and equipment. These expenditures are primarily 
for equipment and tooling related to product improvements, more 
efficient production methods and replacement for normal wear. In 
1995, investing activities used $49 million of cash which consisted of 
capital additions of $52 million offset by $3 million of proceeds from 
asset sales. In 1994, investing activities used $32 million of cash which 
consisted of capital additions of $59 million offset by $27 million of 
proceeds from asset sales. In 1993, investing activities used $26 million of 
cash for capital additions. 
    The level of capital additions in 1995 was consistent with the 
additions in 1994. Capital additions in 1995 included a new production 
line for projection TV picture tubes in the company's Juarez, Mexico, 
plant and new industrial robotics to perform labor-intensive production 
processes in the company's Melrose Park, Illinois, plant. Capital additions 
in 1994 were higher than in 1993 due to investments in plastic injection 
molding operations in Reynosa, Mexico, modernization of a mill room in 
Juarez, and process re-engineering activities throughout the Consumer 
Electronics business. 
    The company is planning significant capital investment projects 
during 1996 and 1997, primarily in the color picture tube area, which 
include the expansion of production capacity for color TV picture tubes, 
new automated production processes and the addition of new production 
lines for computer display tubes and color picture tubes for large-screen 
direct-view color TV sets.

Financing Activities  
Financing activities provided cash of $167 million in 1995, $62 
million in 1994 and $69 million in 1993. The 1995 increase 
in cash provided was due to the company selling $171 million of common 
stock to investors, principally the sale at $10 per share of 16.5 million 
shares to LGE in November. In addition, the company sold 1.3 million 
shares to investors under a shelf registration statement for 6.5 million 
shares of common stock. Cash was also provided during 1995 as the 
company entered into a Term Loan Agreement for $40 million. Cash was 
used during 1995 as the company repurchased $43 million principal 
amount of its 8.5% Convertible Senior Subordinated Debentures due 2000 
and 2001, at par plus accrued interest. This repurchase resulted from the 
exercise by certain holders of the debentures of the right to require 
repurchase of all or a portion of the debentures following a change of 
control of the company, which occurred upon the purchase of a 
controlling interest in the company by LGE.
    In 1994, financing activities provided $62 million of cash which 
included $84 million provided from sales of the company's common stock 
and $12 million from the sale of 8.5% Senior Subordinated Convertible 
Debentures due 2001. This was offset by $35 million of cash used to 
redeem the company's outstanding 12-1/8% Notes due January 1995 at a 
redemption price equal to par value (plus accrued interest).
    In 1993, financing activities provided $69 million of cash which 
included $55 million provided from the sale of 8.5% Senior Subordinated 
Convertible Debentures due 2000 and $24 million provided from sales of 
the company's common stock. This was offset by $10 million of cash used 
to repay borrowings under the company's Credit Agreement.

FINANCIAL CONDITION
- -------------------

As of December 31, 1995, the company had $93 million of cash and had 
interest-bearing obligations that consisted of $169 million of long-term 
debt, the current portion ($9 million) of the Term Loan Agreement and $9 
million of extended-term payables with LGE. The company's long-term 
debt is composed of $115 million of 6-1/4% Convertible Subordinated 
Debentures due 2011 that require annual sinking fund payments of $5.8 
million beginning in 1997, $24 million aggregate principal amount of 
8.5% Senior Subordinated Convertible Debentures due 2000 and 2001, 
and the long-term portion of the Term Loan Agreement ($30 million). The 
Term Loan Agreement requires scheduled quarterly principal payments 
over the life of the loan with a balloon payment of $17 million due on the 
termination date of the loan, June 30, 1998.
    In November 1995, the company entered into a Second Amended 
and Restated Credit Agreement and a First Amended and Restated Term 
Loan Agreement. These agreements replaced similar agreements with the 
same group of lenders and were amended as a result of the purchase by 
LGE, of a controlling interest in the company. These agreements contain 
restrictive financial covenants that must be maintained as of the end of 
each fiscal quarter, including a liabilities to net worth ratio and a 
minimum net worth amount. In addition, these agreements restrict the 
amount of capital expenditures by the company in each fiscal year. The 
Amendments increased the required minimum net worth as of December 
31, 1995 and for each quarter thereafter and also improved the interest 
rate and interest rate options.
    The maximum commitment of funds available for borrowing 
under the Credit Agreement is $110 million, but is limited by a defined 
borrowing base formula related to eligible receivables and eligible 
inventory. The Credit Agreement terminates on June 30, 1998 at which 
time all outstanding indebtedness thereunder would have to be refinanced. 
As of December 31, 1995, no borrowings were outstanding under the 
Credit Agreement in keeping with the seasonal nature of the company's 
working capital needs.
    As discussed in Investing Activities, the company is planning 
significant capital investment projects over the next two years. The 
company is exploring options for additional financing that will be required 
to support these projects. Because these planned capital investment 
projects would exceed the permitted expenditures allowed under the Credit 
Agreement and Term Loan Agreement, the company will need to seek 
amendments to these agreements. There can be no assurance that the 
company will be able to find the additional financing required to support 
these projects nor can there be any assurance that the lenders under the 
Credit Agreement and Term Loan Agreement will approve amendments, if 
requested by the company.
    Although the company believes that its Credit Agreement, 
together with extended-term payables expected to be available from LGE 
and the company's efforts to obtain other financing sources, will be 
adequate to meet its seasonal working capital, capital expenditure and 
other requirements during 1996, there can be no assurance that the 
company will not experience liquidity problems in the future because of 
adverse market conditions or other unfavorable events. 

FASB ACTIONS
- ------------

The Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued Statement No. 
121, "Accounting for the Impairment of Long-Lived Assets and for Long-
Lived Assets to be Disposed Of," in March 1995. The new accounting 
standard (which is effective beginning in 1996) requires that long-lived 
assets be reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in 
circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be 
recoverable. The new accounting standard also requires that long-lived 
assets to be disposed of be reported at the lower of carrying amount or 
fair value less cost to sell. The company has not yet quantified the impact, 
if any, on the consolidated financial position or results of operations of the 
company as a result of the new standard.
    FASB issued Statement No. 123, "Accounting for Stock-Based 
Compensation," in October 1995. The new accounting standard will 
require the company to value all stock-based compensation based on the 
estimated fair value at the grant date and spread the deemed cost over the 
vesting period. The standard permits a choice of whether to charge 
operations or disclose the calculated cost, as pro forma information. The 
new standard requires disclosure, beginning in 1996 of the deemed cost 
effective with 1995 grants. The company has not yet quantified its cost or 
determined its method of compliance with the new standard.

 (b) Reports on Form 8-K

    A report on Form 8-K dated October 19, 1995, was filed by the 
company stating under Item 5 that on October 19, 1995, the company 
issued a press release announcing third-quarter 1995 results.
    A report on Form 8-K dated December 21, 1995, was filed by the 
company stating under Item 5 that on December 21, 1995, the company 
repurchased $42.7 million principal amount of its 8.5 percent Convertible 
Senior Subordinated Debentures due 2000 and 2001, at par plus accrued 
interest, of which an aggregate of $67 million principal amount had been 
previously outstanding.  This repurchase resulted from the right of such 
holders to require repurchase of all or a portion of the debentures 
following a change of control of the company, which change of control 
occurred upon the purchase of a controlling interest in the company by 
LG Electronics, Inc. and its affiliate LG Semicon Ltd., on November 8, 
1995.

The accompanying Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements are an integral 
part of these statements. 


Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements
- --------------------------------------------

Note One - Significant Accounting Policies:  Principles of 
consolidation: The consolidated financial statements include the accounts 
of Zenith Electronics Corporation and all domestic and foreign 
subsidiaries (the company). All significant intercompany balances and 
transactions have been eliminated.
    Use of estimates:  The preparation of financial statements in 
conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires 
management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported 
amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and 
the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting 
period. Actual results could differ from those estimates.
    Statements of consolidated cash flows:  The company considers 
time deposits, certificates of deposit and all highly liquid investments 
purchased with an original maturity of three months or less to be cash. 
    Inventories:  Inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market. 
Costs are determined for all inventories except picture tube inventories 
using the first-in, first-out (FIFO) method. Picture tube inventories are 
valued using the last-in, first-out (LIFO) method.
    Properties and depreciation:  Additions of plant and equipment 
with lives of eight years or more are depreciated by the straight-line 
method over their useful lives. Accelerated methods are used for 
depreciation of virtually all other plant and equipment items, including 
high technology equipment that may be subject to rapid economic 
obsolescence. 
    Property held for disposal is stated at the lower of cost or 
estimated net realizable value. As of December 31, 1995,  and 1994, $3.4 
million and $4.6 million, respectively, of property held for disposal was 
included in Other noncurrent assets and included certain facilities and land 
no longer used in the company's operations.
    Most tooling expenditures are charged to expense in the year 
acquired, except for picture tube tooling, which is amortized over four 
years. Certain production fixtures are capitalized as machinery and 
equipment.
    Rental expenses under operating leases were $15.3 million, $13.6 
million and $9.0 million in 1995, 1994 and 1993, respectively. 
Commitments for lease payments in future years are not material.
    The company capitalizes interest on major capital projects. Such 
interest has not been material.
    Engineering, research, product warranty and other costs:  
Engineering and research costs are expensed as incurred. Estimated costs 
for product warranties are provided at the time of sale based on 
experience factors. The costs of co-op advertising and merchandising 
programs are also provided at the time of sale.
    Foreign currency:  The company uses the U.S. dollar as the 
functional currency for all foreign subsidiaries. Foreign exchange gains 
and losses are included in Other operating expense (income) and netted to 
a $3.6 million gain in 1994. These amounts were not material in 1995 and 
1993.
    Earnings per share:  Primary earnings per share are based upon 
the weighted average number of shares outstanding and common stock 
equivalents, if dilutive. Fully diluted earnings per share, assuming 
conversion of the 6 1/4 percent convertible subordinated debentures and 
the 8.5 percent convertible senior subordinated debentures, are not 
presented because the effect of the assumed conversion is antidilutive. The 
number of shares used in the computation were 49.2 million, 42.0 million 
and 32.3  million in 1995, 1994 and 1993, respectively. 

Note Two - Financial Results and Liquidity:  The company has 
incurred net losses of $92.4 million, $14.2 million and $97.0 million in 
1995, 1994 and 1993, respectively. For many years the company's major 
competitors, many with greater resources, have aggressively lowered their 
selling prices in an attempt to increase market share. Although the 
company has benefited from cost reduction programs, these lower color 
television prices together with inflationary cost increases have more than 
offset such cost reduction benefits.
    The company's Credit Agreement (see Note Ten) expires on June 
30, 1998. The maximum commitment of funds available for borrowing 
under the Credit Agreement is $110 million, but is limited by a defined 
borrowing base formula related to eligible receivables and eligible 
inventory. 
    The company is planning significant capital investment projects 
during 1996 and 1997, primarily in the color picture tube area, which 
include the expansion of production capacity for color TV picture tubes, 
new automated production processes and the addition of new production 
lines for computer display tubes and color picture tubes for large-screen 
direct-view color TV sets. The company is exploring options for 
additional financing that will be required to support these projects. 
Because these planned capital investment projects would exceed the 
permitted expenditures allowed under the Credit Agreement and Term 
Loan Agreement, the company will need to seek amendments to these 
agreements. There can be no assurance that the company will be able to 
find the additional financing required to support these projects nor can 
there be any assurance that the lenders under the Credit Agreement and 
Term Loan Agreement will approve amendments, if requested by the 
company.
    Although the company believes that its Credit Agreement, 
together with extended-term payables expected to be available from LG 
Electronics, Inc. (LGE) and the company's efforts to obtain other 
financing sources, will be adequate to meet its seasonal working capital, 
capital expenditure and other requirements during 1996, there can be no 
assurances that the company will not experience liquidity problems in the 
future because of adverse market conditions or other unfavorable events.

Note Three - Related Party:  On November 8, 1995, LGE purchased 
18,619,000 shares of common stock of the company pursuant to LGE's 
tender offer at $10.00 per share, and purchased 16,500,000 newly issued 
shares of common stock from the company at $10.00 per share. After 
giving effect to such transactions, LGE beneficially owns 36,569,000 
shares of common stock, which represents approximately 57.7 percent of 
the outstanding common stock.
    LGE is a leading international brand-name manufacturer of five 
main groups of products: televisions; audio and video equipment; home 
appliances; computers and office automation equipment; and other 
products, including video displays, telecommunication products and 
components, and magnetic media.
    Because LGE owns a majority of the issued and outstanding 
common stock, it effectively controls the outcome of any matter requiring 
action by a majority of the company's stockholders, including the election 
of a majority of the company's directors and any future change in control 
of the company.
    The following represent the most significant transactions between 
the company and LGE during 1995, all of which, in the opinion of 
management, were made at an arms-length basis:
    Product purchases: In the ordinary course of business, the 
company purchases VCRs, TV-VCR combinations and components from 
LGE and its affiliates. The company purchased $87.2 million of these 
items in 1995. Sales of products purchased from LGE and its affiliates 
contributed $92.5 million to sales and $5.3 million to gross margin in 
1995.
    Product and other sales: The company sells CRT tubes and 
yokes and other manufactured subassemblies to LGE and its affiliates at 
prices that equate to amounts charged by the company to its major 
customers. Sales in 1995 by the company to LGE and its affiliates were 
$31.7 million with a contribution of $2.8 million to gross margin. 
    Technical agreements: The company and LGE are currently 
operating under several technology agreements and licenses, including: 
LGE engineering support for HDTV development and related technical 
and intellectual property; technology and patent licenses to LGE to 
develop FTM products; and agreements granting LGE the right to use the 
company's patents on TV tuners. LGE's net payment in 1995 to the 
company under these agreements and licenses was $1.1 million.
    As of December 31, 1995, receivables included $7.7 million from 
LGE and its affiliates and accounts payable included $8.9 million to LGE 
and its affiliates.

Note Four - Restructuring and Other Charges:  During the fourth 
quarter of 1995, the company recorded charges totaling $3.6 million that 
were incurred as a consequence of the LGE purchase of common stock as 
described in Note Three.
    During the second quarter of 1995, the company recorded a 
charge of $18.0 million primarily to restructure its core Consumer 
Electronics and Network Systems business. The major elements of the 
restructuring related to severance expenses associated with employment 
reductions, primarily in the company's U.S. salaried workforce and costs 
associated with realigned distribution activities as the company changed to 
direct-to-retail distribution on a nationwide basis. The remaining charges 
related to other non-recurring items, including certain environmental, legal 
and other regulatory matters, along with trade receivable write-offs 
(primarily for accounts in Mexico as a result of the December 1994 peso 
devaluation).
    During the fourth quarter of 1993, the company recorded a charge 
of $31.0 million primarily to restructure certain product areas and re-
engineer its core business. The restructuring affected computer monitors 
and magnetics, product areas that were phased out or sold in 1994. The 
fourth-quarter charge was primarily for non-cash fixed asset and 
inventory write-downs, as well as severance costs, and was designed to 
reduce fixed costs and operating expenses.

Note Five - Income Taxes:  The components of income taxes (credit)

    The valuation allowance was established since the realization of 
these assets cannot be reasonably assured, given the company's recurring 
losses.
    As of December 31, 1995, the company had $412.2 million of 
total net operating loss carryforwards (NOLs) available for federal 
income tax purposes (which expire from 2004 through 2010) and unused 
tax credits of $3.6 million (which expire from 2000 through 2002).
    The stock purchase by LGE described in Note Three created an 
"ownership change" of the company for federal income tax purposes, with 
the effect that the company's annual usage of its NOLs will be limited to 
approximately $27 million, which represents the product of (i) a tax-
exempt rate of return announced monthly by the Internal Revenue Service 
(5.75 percent for ownership changes occurring in the month of November 
1995) and (ii) the value of the company immediately before the ownership 
change, as determined under applicable tax regulations. This limitation, 
appropriately modified, will also apply to the company's utilization of 
most of its tax credit carryovers. The effect of this annual limit will 
depend upon the generation of sufficient taxable income in the future and 
certain other factors.

Note Six - Geographic Segment Data:  The company's operations 
involve a dominant industry segment the design, development, 
manufacture and distribution of video products, including color TV sets, 
VCRs and other consumer electronics products, color picture tubes, cable 
TV products and parts and accessories for these products.
    Financial information, summarized by geographic area, is as

    Foreign operations consist of manufacturing and sales 
subsidiaries in Mexico, a distribution subsidiary in Canada and a 
purchasing office in Taiwan. Sales to affiliates are principally accounted 
for at amounts based on local costs of production plus a reasonable 
return.
    Sales to a single customer amounted to $172.1 million (14 
percent) in 1995 and $180.8 million (12 percent) in 1994. No other 
customer accounted for 10 percent or more of net sales.

Note Seven - Other Operating Expense (Income):  Major 
manufacturers of TVs and VCRs agreed during 1992 to take licenses 
under some of the company's U.S. tuning system patents (the licenses 
expire in 2003). Royalty income related to the tuning system patents was 
$25.9 million, $27.9 million and $25.7 million in 1995, 1994 and 1993, 
respectively, and is included in Other operating expense (income).

    During 1994 the company recorded $11.0 million of net gain on 
asset sales. Included in this amount is a $5.4 million gain on the sale of a 
warehouse in Northlake, Illinois, and a $3.6 million gain on the sale of 
vacant land adjacent to its Glenview, Illinois, headquarters. The company 
also sold a facility in Lenexa, Kansas, its power supply business, a 
facility in Chicago, Illinois, and a facility in Springfield, Missouri.

Note Ten - Short-term Debt and Credit Arrangements:  The company 
entered into a Second Amended and Restated Credit Agreement dated as 
of November 6, 1995, with a lending group led by General Electric 
Capital Corporation, for working capital purposes. The Credit Agreement 
replaced a similar credit agreement with the same group of lenders. 
    Borrowings under the Credit Agreement, similar to the former 
agreement, are secured by accounts receivable, inventory, general 
intangibles and trademarks of the company. The Credit Agreement is 
scheduled to expire on June 30, 1998. The maximum commitment of 
funds available for borrowing under the Credit Agreement is $110 million, 
but is limited by a defined borrowing base formula related to eligible 
receivables and eligible inventory. Net proceeds arising from material 
asset transactions will result in a partial reduction in the maximum 
commitment of the lenders thereunder. Interest on borrowings is based on 
market rates with a commitment fee of 3/8 percent per annum payable 
monthly on the unused balance of the facility. As of December 31, 1995, 
no borrowings were outstanding under the Credit Agreement.
    The Credit Agreement contains restrictive financial covenants that 
must be maintained as of the end of each fiscal quarter, including a 
liabilities to net worth ratio and a minimum net worth amount. As of 
December 31, 1995, the ratio of liabilities to net worth was required to be 
not greater than 3.50 to 1.0 and was actually 1.25 to 1.0, and net worth 
was required to be equal to or greater than $251.0 million and was 
actually $307.1 million. At the end of each fiscal quarter through April 4, 
1998, the liabilities to net worth ratio is required to be maintained at 4.00 
to 1.0, and minimum net worth is required to be $245.0 million. The 
Credit Agreement restricts the amount of capital expenditures by the 
company in each fiscal year. For the fiscal years 1995, 1996, 1997 and 
each fiscal year thereafter the company is permitted to make capital 
expenditures (as defined in the Credit Agreement) of up to $80.0 million, 
$142.0 million, $87.0 million and $60.0 million, respectively. As the 
company plans to undertake capital investment projects that would exceed 
the permitted expenditures, the company will need to seek an amendment 
to the Credit Agreement. There can be no assurance that the lenders under 
the Credit Agreement will approve an amendment, if requested by the 
company.
    In addition, there are restrictions regarding investments, 
acquisitions, guaranties, transactions with affiliates, sales of assets, 
mergers and additional borrowings, along with limitations on liens. The 
Credit Agreement prohibits dividend payments on the company's common 
stock, restricts dividend payments on any of its preferred stock, if issued, 
and prohibits the redemption or repurchase of stock.

outstanding and included in Accounts payable.

     Total long-term debt                           $168.8     $182.0
                                                  =======================	

    The company entered into a First Amended and Restated Term 
Loan Agreement dated as of November 6, 1995, with a lending group led 
by General Electric Capital Corporation. The Term Loan replaced a 
similar term loan agreement with the same group of lenders. The Term 
Loan was in the initial principal amount of $40 million, and requires 
scheduled quarterly principal payments over the life of the loan with a 
balloon payment of $17.5 million due on the termination date of the loan, 
June 30, 1998, and additional mandatory prepayment in certain events. 
The borrowing under the Term Loan Agreement is secured by the tuning 
system patent license agreements of the company and a second security 
interest in the accounts receivable, inventory, general intangibles and 
trademarks of the company. The Term Loan Agreement contains the same 
financial covenants and other restrictions that are contained in the Credit 
Agreement (see Note Ten). Interest on the borrowing is based on market 
rates.
    The 6 1/4 percent convertible subordinated debentures are 
unsecured general obligations, subordinate in right of payment to certain 
other debt obligations, and are convertible into common stock at $31.25 
per share. Terms of the debenture agreement include annual sinking-fund 
payments of $5.8 million beginning in 1997. The debentures are 
redeemable at the option of the company, in whole or in part, at specified 
redemption prices at par or above.
    The 8.5 percent debentures due 2000 and 2001 are unsecured 
general obligations, subordinate in right of payment to certain other debt 
obligations, and are convertible into shares of common stock at an initial 
conversion price of $9.76 per share and $10.00 per share, respectively. 
The debentures due 2000 and 2001 are redeemable at the option of the 
company, in whole or in part, at any time on or after November 19, 1997 
and January 18, 1998, respectively, at specified redemption prices at par 
or above.
    On December 21, 1995, the company repurchased $42.7 million 
principal amount of the 8.5 percent debentures, at par plus accrued 
interest. This repurchase resulted from the exercise by certain holders of 
the debentures of the right to require repurchase of all or a portion of the 
debentures following a change of control of the company, which occurred 
upon the purchase of a controlling interest in the company by LGE.
    The fair value of long-term debt is $130.6 million as of December 
31, 1995, as compared to the carrying amount of $168.8 million. The fair 
value of the 6 1/4 percent convertible subordinated debentures is based on 
the quoted market price from the New York Stock Exchange. The fair 
value of the 8.5 percent convertible senior subordinated debentures is 
based on the quoted price obtained from third party financial institutions. 
The fair value of the Term Loan approximates the carrying value as 
interest on the loan is based on market rates. Currently, the company's 
Credit Agreement and Term Loan Agreement would not allow the 
company to extinguish the long-term debt through purchase and thereby 
realize the gain.

                                        ====================================	

    In November 1995, the Company sold 16.5 million shares of 
authorized but unissued shares of common stock to LGE for a price of 
$10 per share. See Note Three for further discussion.
    During 1995, 1994 and 1993 the company sold 1.3 million 
shares, 8.6 million shares and 3.4 million shares, respectively, of 
authorized but unissued shares of common stock to investors under 
registration statements that had been filed with the Securities and 
Exchange Commission.
    Pursuant to a Rights Agreement (as amended), a "right" entitling 
the holder thereof to purchase under certain conditions, one-half of one 
share of common stock at an exercise price of $37.50, subject to 
adjustment, was distributed with respect to each outstanding share of 
common stock in 1986, and with respect to each additional share of 
common stock that has become outstanding since then. 
    The rights will become exercisable upon the earlier to occur of (i) 
the 10th day after a public announcement that a third party has become 
the beneficial owner of 25 percent or more of the outstanding common 
stock (an "acquiring person") or (ii) the 10th day after the commencement 
of, or the announcement of an intention to commence, an offer the 
consummation of which would result in a third party beneficially owning 
25 percent or more of the common stock.
    In the event any person becomes an acquiring person, each holder 
of a right (other than the acquiring person) will thereafter have the right to 
receive upon exercise that number of shares of common stock having a 
market value of two times the exercise price of the right. The rights, which 
have no voting rights, expire in 1996. The rights may be redeemed at the 
option of the company at any time prior to such time as any person 
becomes an acquiring person. Under certain conditions and following a 
stockholder vote, the rights shall be redeemed by the company. In either 
case, the redemption price will be $.05 per right, subject to adjustment.
    The Rights Agreement also provides that under certain 
circumstances at any time after any person has become an acquiring 
person, the Board of Directors may exchange the rights (other than rights 
owned by such person) in whole or in part, for common stock at an 
exchange ratio of one-half of a share of common stock per right, subject 
to adjustment. In connection with the LGE transaction, LGE is not 
considered to be a third party.
    At the company's Annual Meeting of Stockholders in April 1995, 
the stockholders voted to amend the company's Restated Certificate of 
Incorporation to increase the authorized common stock of the company 
from 100,000,000 shares to 150,000,000 shares.
    At the company's Annual Meeting of Stockholders in May 1993, 
the stockholders approved the authorization of 8 million shares of 
preferred stock of which none are issued or outstanding as of December 
31, 1995. The Board of Directors of the company is authorized to issue 
the preferred stock from time to time in one or more series and to 
determine all relevant terms of each such series, including but not limited 
to the following (i) whether and upon what terms, the shares of such series 
would be redeemable; (ii) whether a sinking fund would be provided for 
the redemption of the shares of such series and, if so, the terms thereof; 
and (iii) the preference, if any, to which shares of such series would be 
entitled in the event of voluntary or involuntary liquidation of the 
company.

Note Thirteen - Stock Options and Awards:  The 1987 Stock Incentive 
Plan authorizes the granting of incentive and non-qualified stock options, 
restricted stock awards and stock appreciation rights to key management 
personnel. The purchase price of shares under option is the market price 
of the shares on the date of grant. Options expire 10 years from the date 
granted.

    Transactions in 1995 and 1994 are summarized below:

                                                  1995          1994

   Outstanding at December 31                 6 3/8 - 13     6 3/8 - 13

    The company had 9,339 and 189,108 restricted stock awards 
issued and outstanding as of December 31, 1995 and 1994, respectively. 
The market value of the restricted shares is deferred in the additional paid-
in capital account and is generally amortized over the years the 
restrictions lapse. The 1995 decrease was caused primarily by restrictions 
being lifted as a consequence of the change in control of the company. 
Total compensation expense in 1995 and 1994, related to these awards, 
was not material.

Note Fourteen - Retirement Plans and Employee Benefits:  Virtually 
all employees in the United States and Canada are eligible to participate in 
noncontributory profit-sharing retirement plans after completing one full 
year of service. The plans provide for a minimum annual contribution of 6 
percent of employees' eligible compensation. Contributions above the 
minimum could be required based upon profits in excess of a specified 
return on net worth. Profit-sharing contributions were $8.8 million, $9.7 
million and $9.7 million in 1995, 1994 and 1993, respectively. The 1994 
and 1993 contributions were partially funded through the issuance of 
approximately 547,000 and 1,021,000 shares, respectively, of the 
company's common stock.
    Employees in Mexico are covered by government-mandated plans, 
the costs of which are accrued by the company. 
    Benefits payable to employees when they leave the company other 
than by reason of retirement did not have a material effect on the financial 
statements of the company, nor is it expected to have a material effect on 
future results of operations.

Note Fifteen - Contingencies:  The company is involved in various legal 
actions, environmental matters, patent claims, and other proceedings 
relating to a wide range of matters that are incidental to the conduct of its 
business. In addition, the company remains liable for certain retained 
obligations of a discontinued business, principally income and other taxes 
prior to the closing of the sale. 
    In 1994, the company notified its 15 independent distributors of 
its intent to change to direct-to-retail distribution on a nationwide basis 
during 1995. In February 1995, one of the independent distributors filed 
suit challenging the company's right to discontinue the distributorship 
relationship and alleging that it had been damaged by certain of the 
company's practices. The lawsuit sought injunctive relief, actual damages 
of $8 million and punitive damages of $20 million. In October 1995 
summary judgment dismissing the case on all counts was entered. The 
plaintiff has filed notice of appeal. Another suit arising in connection with 
this change in distribution was filed in April 1995 by another independent 
distributor. The lawsuit seeks approximately $13 million in damages 
under the Wisconsin Fair Dealership Law. In January 1996 the court 
denied the company's motion for summary judgment and granted the 
plaintiff's motion for summary judgment, finding the company is liable. A 
jury trial setting the amount of the plaintiff's damages, if any, is expected 
in April 1996.
    The company believes, after reviewing such matters and 
consulting with the company's counsel, that any liability that may 
ultimately be incurred with respect to all of the above matters is not 
expected to have a material effect on either the company's consolidated 
financial position or results of operations.



               REPORT OF INDEPENDENT PUBLIC ACCOUNTANTS



To the Stockholders of Zenith Electronics Corporation: 

We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Zenith 
Electronics Corporation (a Delaware corporation) and subsidiaries as of 
December 31, 1995 and 1994, and the related statements of consolidated 
operations and retained earnings and cash flows for each of the three years 
in the period ended December 31, 1995. These financial statements are the 
responsibility of the company's management. Our responsibility is to 
express an opinion on these financial statements based on our audits.
    We conducted our audits in accordance with generally accepted auditing 
standards. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to 
obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are 
free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test 
basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial 
statements. An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles 
used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating 
the overall financial statement presentation. We believe that our audits 
provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.
    In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above 
present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of Zenith 
Electronics Corporation and subsidiaries as of December 31, 1995 and 
1994, and the results of their operations and their cash flows for each of 
the three years in the period ended December 31, 1995, in conformity with 
generally accepted accounting principles.
