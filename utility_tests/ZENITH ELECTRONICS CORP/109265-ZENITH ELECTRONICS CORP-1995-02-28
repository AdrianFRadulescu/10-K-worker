                                  PART I
ITEM 1. BUSINESS

  The company was founded in 1918 and has been a leader in consumer 
electronics, first in radio and later in monochrome and color television and 
other video products. The company's operations involve a dominant 
industry segment, the design, development, and manufacture of video 
products (including color television sets and other consumer products) along 
with parts and accessories for such products. These products along with 
purchased video cassette recorders are sold principally to major retail 
dealers and independent and wholly-owned regional wholesale distributors 
in the United States, Canada and other foreign countries. The company intends 
to changeover to an entirely direct-to-retail distribution organization during
1995. The company also sells directly to buying groups and private label 
customers in the lodging, health care and rent-to-own industries.
  The company's video products also include color picture tubes that are 
produced for and sold to other manufacturers and Network Systems 
products such as cable and telecommunication set-top devices, interactive 
television and data communication products which are sold primarily to 
cable television operators and other commercial users of these products.
   The company has sold or downsized its non-core business activities. The 
company sold its monochrome video monitor business in 1993 and its 
power supply business in April 1994. Its activities in color video monitors 
sold to computer manufacturers have been scaled back in 1994 and will 
cease in the near future; its activities in high-security electronic equipment 
have been discontinued.
   The company has reported substantial losses from its continuing 
operations for each of the last ten years. These results reflect the cumulative 
effect of frequent and significant color TV price reductions during the 
1980s and, in the early 1990s, also reflected recessionary conditions in the 
United States. In addition, the company has invested significant amounts in 
engineering and research in recent years, which amounts have been 
expensed as incurred.

Raw Materials
  Many materials, such as copper, plastic, steel, wood, glass, aluminum and 
zinc, are essential to the business. Adequate sources of supply exist for 
these materials, although picture tube glass shortages did occur in 1993 (due 
to a continuing industry glass shortage). During 1994 the company's picture 
tube production was not limited by this continuing industry glass shortage.

Patents
  The company is licensed under a number of patents which are of 
importance to its business, and holds numerous patents that expire at 
various times through 2011.  The company has patents and patent 
applications for numerous high-definition television (HDTV) related 
inventions. To the extent these inventions are incorporated into the HDTV 
standard to be adopted by the Federal Communications Commission, the 
company expects to receive royalties from these patents. In addition, 
royalties have been and may be received from these patents for non-HDTV 
applications as well. In addition, major manufacturers of televisions and 
video cassette recorders agreed during 1992 to take licenses under some of 
the company's U.S. tuning system patents (the licenses expire in 2003). 
While in the aggregate its patents and licenses are valuable, the business
of the company is not materially dependent on them. Based on 1994 U.S. 
industry unit sales levels and technology, more than $25 million in annual
royalty income is expected through the licensing period.

Seasonal Variations in Business
  Sales of the company's consumer electronics products are generally at a 
higher level during the second half of the year. Sales of consumer 
electronics products typically increase in the fall, as the summer vacation 
season ends and people spend more time indoors with the new fall 
programming on television and during the Christmas holiday season. 
During 1994, 1993 and 1992, 59 percent, 54 percent and 56 percent, 
respectively, of the company's net sales were recorded in the second half 
of the year and approximately 30 percent of the company's net sales were 
recorded in the fourth quarter of each of the three years ended 
December 31, 1994.

Competitive Conditions
  Competitive factors in North America include price, performance, quality, 
variety of products and features offered, marketing and sales capabilities, 
manufacturing costs, and service and support.  The company believes it 
competes well with respect to each of these factors.
  The company's major product areas, including the color television market, 
are highly competitive. The company's major competitors are foreign-
owned global giants, generally with greater worldwide television volume and 
overall resources. In efforts to increase market share or achieve higher 
production volumes, the company's competitors have aggressively lowered 
their selling prices in the past several years. During 1994, the company 
continued to pursue efforts to reduce unfair competition from television 
imports.

Research and Development
  During 1994 expenditures for company-sponsored engineering and 
research relating to new products and services and to improvements of 
existing products and services amounted to $45.4 million.  Amounts 
expended in 1993 and 1992 were $47.8 million and $55.4 million, 
respectively.

Environmental Issues
  Compliance with Federal, State and local environmental protection 
provisions is not expected to have a material effect on capital expenditures, 
earnings or the competitive position of the company.  Further information 
regarding environmental compliance is set forth under Item 3 of this report.

Number of Employees
  At the end of December 1994, the company employed approximately 
22,500 people, of whom approximately 16,200 are hourly workers covered 
by collective bargaining agreements. Approximately 4,700 of the company's 
employees are located in the Chicago, Illinois area, of whom approximately 
3,100 are represented by unions. Approximately 16,800 of the company's 
employees are located in Mexico, of whom approximately 12,800 are 
represented by unions. Mexican labor contracts expire every two years and 
wages are renegotiated annually or more frequently under rapid devaluation 
or high inflation periods. The company believes that its relations with its 
employees are good.

Financial Information about Foreign and Domestic Operations and Export Sales
  The North American Free Trade Agreement ("NAFTA"), which took 
effect on January 1, 1994, significantly reduced duty costs in 1994. The 
NAFTA also improved the company's ability to compete against Asian 
imports in North America and increased sales of the company's color 
television receivers in Mexico and Canada and color picture tube production 
in the U.S. Since the passage of the NAFTA, the company has added 
approximately 300 U.S. jobs that are directly related to increased demand 
for U.S. picture tubes.
  Information regarding foreign operations is included in "Note Five - 
Geographic Segment Data" on page 33 of this report.  Export sales are less 
than 10% of consolidated net sales.
  The company's product lines are dependent on the continuing operations 
of the company's manufacturing and assembly facilities located in Mexico.



ITEM 2. PROPERTIES

  The company utilizes a total of approximately 6.0 million square feet for 
manufacturing, warehousing, engineering and research, administration and

included in the above table.

  The company's facilities are suitable and adequate to meet current and 
anticipated requirements. None of the real property owned by the company 
is mortgaged


ITEM 3.  LEGAL PROCEEDINGS

The company is involved in various legal actions, environmental matters, 
and other proceedings relating to a wide range of matters that are incidental 
to the conduct of its business.  The company believes, after reviewing such 
matters with the company,s counsel, that any liability which may ultimately  
be incurred with respect to these matters is not expected to have a material 
effect on either the company's consolidated financial position or results of 
operations.
   On April 27, 1993, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency ("EPA") 
sent written notices to all potentially responsible parties, advising the 
parties of the EPA's proposed plan of remediation at the American Chemical 
Services site near Griffith, Indiana.  The EPA notified the parties that they 
would be expected to make a good faith offer to perform the remedial 
action and thereafter to negotiate and enter into a consent decree with the 
agency.  The EPA estimates that the cost of remedial action could range 
from $38 to $64 million, depending upon the type of remedy actually 
needed to effect the cleanup.  The company is alleged to have contributed 
less than one-tenth of one percent of the hazardous waste identified at the 
site.  The company and other de minimus waste generators entered into a de 
minimus settlement with the EPA in July 1994.  In January 1995, the 
company paid $114,000 as its share of the settlement.
   In October 1989, the EPA filed a civil action against certain generator 
and owner/operator defendants under the Comprehensive Environmental Response,
Compensation and Liabilities Act seeking reimbursement for the EPA's 
response costs in connection with an environmental cleanup at a site 
known as Moyer Landfill located at Collegeville, Pennsylvania.  One of the 
original defendants to the EPA case brought a third party action for 
contribution against a number of third party defendants, including Ford 
Electronics and Refrigeration Corporation ("FERCO").  FERCO sought 
$600,000 in contribution from the company on the ground that FERCO is 
being held liable in part because it hauled certain waste from the company's 
former Lansdale, Pennsylvania picture tube plant.  The company recently 
entered into an agreement with FERCO and agreed to contribute $300,000 
toward a settlement with the federal government and the Commonwealth of 
Pennsylvania, subject to negotiation of an acceptable consent decree. 
   Numerous lawsuits against major computer and peripheral equipment 
manufacturers are pending in the U.S. District Court, Eastern District of 
New York, the U.S. District Court of New Jersey and the New York State 
courts, as well as other federal courts.  These lawsuits seek several billion 
dollars in damages from various defendants for repetitive stress injuries 
claimed to have been caused by the use of word processor equipment.  The 
company has been named as a defendant in twenty-seven of these cases 
which relate to keyboards allegedly manufactured by the company for its 
former subsidiary, Zenith Data Systems Corporation.  Plaintiffs in the 
company's cases seek to recover $31 million actual and $321 million 
punitive damages from the company.  The company believes it has 
meritorious defenses to the cases.
   In April, 1993, a group of 47 plaintiffs, individually and on behalf of 
certain minors and decedents, filed suit in the District Court of Cameron 
County, Texas against approximately 130 defendants, including the 
company's subsidiaries, Zenith Electronics Corporation of Texas and 
Electro Partes de Matamoros, S.A. de C.V. alleging that plaintiffs suffered 
injuries or death as a result of defendants' negligence, negligent design for 
and implemented practices of managing, handling, storage, transportation, 
utilization and disposal of toxic compounds.  Plaintiffs seek judgment for 
actual and punitive damages against defendants, jointly and severally, in an 
unspecified amount.  The company's two subsidiaries filed answers denying 
the material allegations of the complaint.  The parties are presently in 
discovery and the trial is currently scheduled for August 14, 1995.
   In December, 1994, the company notified its 15 remaining independent 
wholesale distributors of color television and other consumer electronics 
products of its intent to change to "one-step" (direct-to-retail) distribution 
on a nationwide basis during the first half of 1995.  The company offered 
to extend its 1994 agreement with each distributor for a negotiated period 
up to six months ending June 30, 1995.  These independent distributors 
currently distribute the company's products in certain areas of the U.S.  
Through the early 1970s, independent distributors located throughout the 
U.S. handled most of the company's consumer electronics business.  
Currently, however, following industry trends, the majority of the 
company's sales are made directly to retail customers.  In February, 1995, 
one of the independent distributors, Electrical Distributing, Inc. ("EDI"), 
based in Portland, Oregon, filed suit in the Oregon state court challenging 
the company's right to cease its relationship with EDI and alleging that 
certain company practices during the course of the relationship have 
damaged EDI.  The EDI lawsuit seeks injunctive relief, actual damages of 
$8 million, and punitive damages of $20 million.  The company believes it 
has the right to change its method of distribution and has met all of its legal 
obligations to EDI.  Accordingly, the company intends to defend itself 
vigorously.

ITEM 4.  SUBMISSION OF MATTERS TO A VOTE OF SECURITY HOLDERS

  No matter was submitted to a vote of security holders during the fourth 
quarter of 1994, through the solicitation of proxies or otherwise.

Operating Results -- 1994 vs. 1993

The operating loss before restructuring and other charges was $10 million in 
1994 and $51 million in 1993.
   Consolidated sales in 1994 were $1,469 million, up 20 percent from 
$1,228 million in 1993. The significant increase was principally due to 
higher unit volume in the core business, Consumer Electronics and Network 
Systems, which was partially offset by lower sales in the non-core product 
areas and lower Consumer Electronics product pricing.
   As in previous years, substantial cost reductions were realized company-
wide. These savings, about $40 million in 1994, resulted from continued 
process and design improvements, improved efficiencies, re-engineering 
and continued consolidations. In addition, the implementation of the North 
American Free Trade Agreement ("NAFTA") reduced the company's duty 
costs by $19 million. These cost reductions were offset by $46 million of 
consumer product price reductions that were implemented throughout the 
year, and $22 million of inflationary cost increases.
   Even with the continued industry-wide picture tube glass shortage, 
industry color TV unit sales to dealers increased by 10 percent in 1994 
(following two successive years of 11 percent increases) to a record 27.4 
million units. The company's unit sales increase was significantly higher 
than the industry growth rate, which resulted in an improved market share 
for the company. The company's increase was especially strong in key 
industry-growth categories, such as projection TV, large-screen table 
models and combination TV-VCR products. Industry sales of video cassette 
recorders to dealers increased 6 percent in 1994 and, again, the company's 
volume increased even more.
   In 1994, picture tube production was up 21 percent facilitated by the late 
1993 conversion of a monitor tube production line to television tube 
production. Unit sales of picture tubes to other TV manufacturers were up 
12 percent as demand remained strong due to the industry growth and the 
NAFTA advantage associated with using North American picture tubes. 
The remaining production increase supported the company's own television 
set production. The company's picture tube production was not limited by the 
continuing industry glass shortage.
   Dollar sales increased about 40 percent in the company's Network 
Systems product line, which included the design and manufacture of set-top 
boxes and other products primarily for cable TV operators. The results in 
1994 reflect the effort to refocus this core product line through a 
reorganization and new product offerings as well as an improved industry 
environment. At year-end 1994, the company recorded a $4 million reserve 
related to the replacement of defective integrated circuits in some cable 
decoders.
   Sales of other products decreased by $59 million in 1994 as the company 
continued to phase-out or sell its non-core businesses. Corporate operating 
results improved as these businesses were scaled back and eliminated. 
During the year, production of both monochrome and color monitors 
ceased. The magnetics business was sold in April 1994, although the 
company will continue to manufacture power supplies for the purchaser of 
the business until April 1995.
   The company realized a gain of $11 million on 1994 asset sales, including 
more than 3 million square feet of excess plant and office space, 98 acres of 
vacant land, and assets related to the magnetics business.
   Engineering and research expenses were $45 million in 1994, compared 
with $48 million in 1993, with reductions principally in non-core product 
areas. Selling, general and administrative expenses increased to $117 million 
in 1994 from $93 million in 1993, primarily due to increased advertising 
costs in the United States and Mexico in support of the higher sales volume.
   Other operating income (net) increased to $34 million in 1994 from $25 
million in 1993, principally as a result of increased royalty income 
(primarily for tuning system license agreements due to the growth in the 
domestic industry) and foreign exchange gains caused by the Mexican peso 
devaluation.


Operating Results -- 1993 vs. 1992

The operating loss before restructuring and other charges was $51 million in 
1993 and $61 million in 1992.
   Consolidated sales in 1993 were $1,228 million, down 1 percent from 
$1,244 million in 1992.  The decline was principally due to lower sales in 
the non-core product areas and lower consumer product pricing, largely 
offset by higher unit volume in the consumer product line.
   The effect on operating results of unit volume increases in consumer 
products was offset by volume declines in the non-core product areas. 
Substantial cost reductions in all product areas of about $75 million resulted 
from process and design improvements, consolidation of operations in 
Mexico, headcount reductions and other operating changes. These cost 
reductions were offset by $42 million in consumer products price reductions 
that had been implemented throughout 1992 and early 1993, and $20 
million of inflationary cost increases, primarily labor costs in Mexico.
   Despite the adverse impact of an industry glass shortage, industry color 
TV unit sales to dealers rose 11 percent in 1993 (following an 11 percent 
increase in 1992) to set a new record. The company's unit sales increase 
outpaced the industry growth, leading to an increase in market share. While 
industry unit sales to dealers of video cassette recorder decks remained 
about equal to 1992, the company's volume increased.
   Unit sales of color picture tubes to other TV manufacturers decreased in 
1993 because the company used more of its capacity to support increased 
sales of the company's color TVs and because of an industry glass shortage, 
which also adversely impacted the company's color TV sales. Additional 
picture tube capacity became available in late 1993 when the dedicated flat 
tension mask tube production line was converted to be able to produce both 
television and monitor picture tubes.
   Operating results were improved by the full year effect of certain 
manufacturing operations that were consolidated in Mexico during 1992, as 
well as continued efforts to reduce headcounts and  product costs.
   Sales of Network Systems products declined in 1993 as a new product for 
a major contract manufacturing customer was delayed. However, due to 
major cost savings associated with headcount reductions and consolidations 
of manufacturing operations, operating results improved compared to 1992.
   Sales of other products decreased in 1993 as the company downsized its 
non-core magnetics and monitor product areas. However, the cost 
structures of these areas were improved so that operating results in 1993 
were somewhat better than 1992.  During the year, the monochrome 
monitor business was sold (production ended in early 1994) and the 
company reached an agreement to sell the power supply business in early 
1994.
   Engineering and research expenses were $48 million in 1993, compared 
to $55 million in 1992, with reductions principally in non-core product 
areas. Selling, general, and administrative expenses declined slightly to $93 
million in 1993 from $94 million.  These improvements were primarily the 
result of headcount reductions initiated in late 1992.
   Other operating income (net) increased to $25 million in 1993 from $24 
million in 1992, as a result of increased royalty income from new licensing 
activities. Royalty income arising from licensing of the company's patented 
tuning-system technology to other color TV and VCR manufacturers was 
about $26 million in both 1993 and 1992 and is included in other operating 
income (net).
   Interest expense (net) of $15 million in 1993 was higher than 1992's $13 
million as a result of increased average borrowings.
   The income tax credit in 1992 consisted principally of the reversal of 
previously accrued tax reserves no longer required in connection with 
earnings of a foreign subsidiary, and net operating loss carryback 
applications.


Restructuring and Other Charges

   During the fourth quarter of 1993, the company recorded a charge of $31 
million primarily to restructure certain product areas and re-engineer its core 
Consumer Electronics and Network Systems business. The restructuring 
affected computer monitors and magnetics, product areas that were phased-
out or sold in 1994. Major elements of this charge were the non-cash 
writedown of fixed assets and inventory ($23 million) as well as re-
engineering and severance costs ($6 million) that were substantially paid 
during 1994. As expected, the restructuring actions reduced 1994 
compensation expense by approximately $10 million and reduced depreciation 
expense by approximately $4 million. No material changes have occurred or are 
anticipated in these programs or in the estimated costs or benefits of the
programs.
   The 1992 results also included restructuring and other charges of $48 
million. Included in the actions were manufacturing consolidations and 
related employment reductions in Mexico; consolidation of company-owned 
distribution; and salaried employment reductions throughout the company. 
In addition to valuation reserves for inventories and manufacturing 
equipment ($22 million) and severance and relocation costs ($18 million)  
which were substantially paid in 1993 and 1994, the special charges also 
provided for trade-receivable write-offs ($6 million).

Liquidity

Cash decreased by $27 million during the three-year period of 1992-1994. 
The decrease consisted of $86 million of cash used by operating activities 
and $83 million used to purchase fixed assets, net of proceeds from asset 
sales. These uses of cash were offset by $142 million of cash provided from 
financing activities which included sales of the company's common stock 
and the issuance of  long-term debt offset by cash used for the redemption 
of the company's 12-1/8% notes due January 1995, in early 1994.
   Operating activities:  In 1994, $42 million of cash was used by operating 
activities principally to fund a $52 million change in current accounts offset 
by $4 million in net income from operations as adjusted for depreciation 
and gains on the sales of assets. The change in current accounts was 
composed primarily of a $46 million increase in receivables (due to higher 
sales) and a $43 million increase in inventories, (due mainly to increased 
levels of color television production in support of higher sales), partially 
offset by a $40 million increase in accounts payable and accrued expenses. 
In addition, the company reduced cash used by operating activities by 
issuing common stock to the profit-sharing retirement plans to fulfill the 
1994 obligation to salaried employees and a portion of the hourly 
employees. This issuance increased stockholders' equity by $6 million. 
   In 1993, $28 million of  cash was used by operating activities principally 
to fund $45 million of net losses from operations as adjusted for 
depreciation and fixed asset write downs as a part of  restructuring and 
other charges. A decrease in current accounts provided $3 million of cash 
and was composed of a $15 million decrease in receivables offset by an $8 
million increase in inventories and a $4 million decrease in accounts payable 
and accrued expenses.  The decrease in receivables was due to lower sales. 
Also, the company  reduced cash used by operating activities by issuing 
common stock to the profit-sharing retirement plans to fulfill both the 1992 
obligation to salaried employees and the 1993 obligation to salaried  
employees and a portion of the hourly employees. These issuances 
increased stockholders' equity by $15 million.  
   In 1992, $16 million of cash was used by operating activities principally to 
fund $64 million of net losses from operations as adjusted for depreciation, 
fixed asset write downs as a part of a restructuring and a loss on the 
disposition of properties. This was offset by cash provided from a $41 
million decrease in current accounts composed of a $39 million decrease in 
inventories and a  $21 million decrease in receivables, offset by a $15 
million decrease in net income taxes payable and a $4 million decrease in 
accounts payable and accrued expenses. The company reduced cash used 
by operating activities by issuing common stock to the profit-sharing 
retirement plan to fulfill the 1991 obligation to salaried employees, 
increasing stockholders' equity by $6 million.
   Investing activities:  In 1994, investing activities used $32 million of 
cash which consisted of capital additions of $59 million offset by $27 
million of proceeds from asset sales. Capital additions in 1994 were 
significantly higher than in 1993 due mainly to investments in a new plastic 
injection molding operation, modernizing a wood cabinet mill room and re-
engineering activities related to the core Consumer Electronics business. In 
1993, investing activities used $26 million of cash  for capital additions. In 
1992, $25 million of cash was used which consisted of capital additions of 
$32 million offset by $7 million of  proceeds from a 1991 property sale. 
   Financing activities:  In 1994, financing activities provided $62 million of 
cash which included $84 million provided from sales of the company's 
common stock (including stock option exercises) and $12 million from the 
sale of 8.5% senior subordinated convertible debentures due 2001. This 
was offset by $35 million of cash used to redeem the company's outstanding 
12-1/8% notes due January 1995 at a redemption price equal to par value 
(plus accrued interest). In 1993, financing activities provided $69 million of 
cash which included $55 million provided from the sale of  8.5% senior 
subordinated convertible debentures and $24 million provided from sales of 
the company's common stock (including stock option exercises). This was 
offset by $10 million of cash used to repay  borrowings under the 
company's working capital Credit Agreement with a lending group led by 
General Electric Capital Corporation (the "Credit Agreement"). In 1992, 
financing activities provided $11 million of cash which included $10 million 
provided from borrowings under the company's revolving credit and 
security agreement and $1 million provided from the exercise of stock 
options. 

Capital Resources

As of December 31, 1994, total interest-bearing obligations of the company 
consisted of $182 million of long-term debt and $19 million of extended-
term payables with a foreign supplier. The company's long-term debt is 
composed of $115 million of 6 1/4% convertible subordinated debentures 
due 2011 that require annual sinking fund payments of $6 million beginning 
in 1997, $55 million aggregate principal amount of 8.5% senior 
subordinated convertible debentures due 2000 that were issued and sold 
during 1993 in a private placement and $12 million aggregate principal 
amount of 8.5% senior subordinated convertible debentures due 2001 that 
were issued and sold during 1994 in a private placement. 
   In May 1993, the company entered into its current Credit Agreement. 
The maximum commitment of funds available for borrowing under the 
Credit Agreement is $90 million, but is limited by a defined borrowing base 
formula related to eligible accounts and inventory (each as defined in the 
Credit Agreement). The Credit Agreement terminates on June 30, 1996 
(unless extended by agreement of the lenders), at which time all outstanding 
indebtedness thereunder would have to be refinanced. There can be no 
assurance that the Credit Agreement will be extended or refinanced. The 
Credit Agreement contains restrictive financial covenants that must be 
maintained as of the end of each fiscal quarter, including a liabilities to net 
worth ratio and a minimum net worth amount. In addition, the Credit 
Agreement restricts the amount of capital expenditures by the company in 
each fiscal year. As of December 31, 1994, no borrowings were 
outstanding under the Credit Agreement in keeping with the seasonal nature 
of the company's working capital needs.
   A Registration Statement was filed with the Securities and Exchange 
Commission in December 1994 covering 6.5 million shares of common 
stock and became effective in February 1995. The shares of common stock 
may be sold by the company in an at-the-market equity offering(s) or on a 
negotiated or competitive bid basis through underwriters or dealers or 
directly to other purchasers or through agents.
   Although the company believes that its Credit Agreement, together with 
extended-term payables expected to be available from a foreign supplier and 
its continuing efforts to obtain other financing sources, including sales of 
common stock as discussed above, will be adequate to meet its seasonal 
working capital, capital expenditure and other requirements in 1995, there 
can be no assurance that the company will not experience liquidity problems 
in the future because of adverse market conditions or other unfavorable 
events. In such event, the company would be required to seek other sources 
of liquidity, if available. In addition, the company is reviewing possible 
capital investment projects over the next three years (which may require an 
amendment to the Credit Agreement) and options for additional financing 
that would be required to support these projects. If undertaken, the projects 
are expected to reduce the costs and increase production capacity primarily 
in the company's picture tube operations. There can be no assurance that 
these projects will be undertaken (or that such Credit Agreement 
amendment will be obtained, if requested).


Outlook

   The company's major product areas, including the color television market, 
are highly competitive. The company's major competitors are foreign-
owned global giants, generally with greater worldwide television volume and 
overall resources. In efforts to increase market share or achieve higher 
production volumes, the company's competitors have aggressively lowered 
their selling prices in the past several years. Price competition continued in 
1994 and early 1995, and the company selectively reduced color television 
prices to maintain its historical competitive price position. There can be no 
assurance that such competition will not continue to adversely affect the 
company's performance or that the company will be able to maintain its 
market share in the face of such competition. 
   The North American Free Trade Agreement, which took effect on 
January 1, 1994, significantly reduced duty costs in 1994. This improved 
the company's ability to compete against Asian imports in North America 
and increased sales of the company's color television receivers in Mexico 
and Canada and color picture tube production in the U.S. However, in 
December 1994 the Mexican peso devalued by almost 50 percent. The company 
expects that this devaluation will negatively impact the company's sales 
in Mexico, but that any negative impact from the reduced sales will be 
more than offset by the effect on peso denominated expenses in its Mexican 
subsidiaries.
   In light of the company's losses from continuing operations, competitive 
environment and inflationary cost pressures (including purchased material 
as well as labor costs in Mexico where labor contracts expire every two 
years and wages are renegotiated annually or more frequently under rapid 
devaluation or high inflation periods), the company has undertaken major 
cost reduction programs each year. In 1994, the company reduced costs by 
about $40 million from continued process and design improvements, 
improved efficiencies, re-engineering and continued consolidations. The 
company continues to seek additional cost reduction opportunities for 1995 
and beyond, although there can be no assurance that any such cost 
reductions will be achieved. As a part of these cost reduction efforts, the 
company plans significant headcount reductions in the first half of 1995 
which will result in costs associated with severance liabilities. Also, as in 
1994 and 1993, the company may experience an adverse impact as 
shortages of certain components may continue in 1995.
   The goals of the company's business strategy are to improve profitability, 
to introduce new products, to develop new products (such as digital cable 
products incorporating the company-developed transmission technology 
selected in February 1994 by the HDTV Grand Alliance and the FCC 
Advisory Committee review panel), and to re-engineer operations including 
the change over to an entirely direct-to-retail distribution organization. This 
strategy is expected to continue to involve significant expenditures by the 
company in 1995 and beyond.
   The company expects that a number of unusual factors will have an 
adverse effect on first-quarter 1995 results:

* Start-up problems in January and early February at the company's new 
finished-goods warehouse in Ft. Worth, Texas, caused shipments to be 
missed. Those problems have now been resolved.

* TV shipments by the industry and the company to the Mexican market 
were almost completely curtailed after the peso devaluation.  The 
company believes that Mexican dealers are selling off their pre-
devaluation inventory.  With dealer costs up by 40-50 percent in 
pesos, the company expects the Mexican market to recover slowly.

* The company anticipates significant cost reduction benefits in 1995 as a 
result of the peso devaluation.  However, the devaluation impact is expected
to be limited in the first quarter as manufacturing costs flow through 
inventory before being reflected in operating results. 
 
* The company's year-end finished goods inventory was higher than 
target.  This, coupled with reduced shipments from the first two factors 
above, caused the company to cut first-quarter television set production 
by about 17 percent to bring inventories into line.  This will result in a 
first-quarter production rate lower than that expected for the rest of the 
year, with attendant higher per-unit overhead costs.

* The first-quarter is expected to include severance costs related to 
significant headcount reductions in Mexico planned for the first half of 
the year, as well as start-up costs and duplicate overheads to support the 
changeover to an entirely direct-to-retail distribution organization.

    These unusual factors, along with an $11 million effect from price
reductions implemented in 1994 and in early 1995, are expected to result in 
first-quarter 1995 operating results that will be significantly below the 1994 
first-quarter results.
    There can be no assurance that the company will achieve the goals of its 
business strategy, including efforts to improve financial results later in 1995.

The accompanying Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements are an integral 
part of these statements. 


Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements
- ------------------------------------------

Note One - Significant Accounting Policies:
Principles of consolidation: The consolidated financial statements include the 
accounts of Zenith Electronics Corporation and all domestic and foreign 
subsidiaries (the company). All significant intercompany balances and 
transactions have been eliminated.

Statements of consolidated cash flows: The company considers time deposits, 
certificates of deposit and all highly liquid investments purchased with an 
original maturity of three months or less to be cash. 

Inventories: Inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market. Costs are 
determined for all inventories except picture tube inventories using the first-
in, first-out (FIFO) method. Picture tube inventories are valued using the 
last-in, first-out (LIFO) method.

Properties and depreciation: Additions of plant and equipment with lives of 
eight years or more are depreciated by the straight-line method over their 
useful lives. Accelerated methods are used for depreciation of virtually all 
other plant and equipment items, including high technology equipment that may 
be subject to rapid economic obsolescence.
  Property held for disposal is stated at the lower of cost or estimated net 
realizable value. As of December 31, 1994 and 1993, $4.6 million and $5.9 
million, respectively, of property held for disposal was included in Other 
Noncurrent Assets and included certain facilities and land no longer used in 
the company's operations.
  Most tooling expenditures are charged to expense in the year acquired, except 
for picture tube tooling which is amortized over four years. Certain production 
fixtures are capitalized as machinery and equipment.
  Rental expenses under operating leases were $13.6 million, $9.0 million and 
$8.8 million in 1994, 1993 and 1992, respectively. Commitments for lease 
payments in future years are not material.
  The company capitalizes interest on major capital projects. Such interest has 
not been material.

Engineering, research, product warranty and other costs: Engineering and 
research costs are expensed as incurred. Estimated costs for product warranties 
are provided at the time of sale based on experience factors. The costs of 
co-op advertising and merchandising programs are also provided at the time of 
sale.

Foreign currency: The company uses the U.S. dollar as the functional currency 
for all foreign subsidiaries. Foreign exchange gains and losses are included in 
Other operating expense (income) and netted to a $3.6 million gain in 1994. 
These amounts were not material in 1993 and 1992.

Earnings per share: Primary earnings per share are based upon the weighted 
average number of shares outstanding and common stock equivalents, if dilutive. 
Fully diluted earnings per share, assuming conversion of the 6 1/4% convertible 
subordinated debentures and the 8.5% convertible senior subordinated 
debentures, are not presented because the effect of the assumed conversion is 
antidilutive. The number of shares used in the computation were 42.0 million, 
32.3 million and 29.5 million in 1994, 1993 and 1992, respectively. 


Note Two - Financial Results and Liquidity:
The company has incurred losses from operations of $14.2 million, $97.0 million 
and $105.9 million in 1994, 1993 and 1992, respectively. For many years the 
company's major competitors, many with greater resources, have aggressively 
lowered their selling prices in an attempt to increase market share. Although 
the company has benefited from cost reduction programs, these lower color 
television prices together with inflationary cost increases have more than 
offset such cost reduction benefits.
  The company's Credit Agreement (see Note Nine) expires on June 30, 1996. 
The maximum commitment for funds available for borrowing under the Credit 
Agreement is $90 million, but is limited by a defined borrowing base formula 
related to eligible accounts receivable and inventory. Although the company 
believes that its Credit Agreement, together with extended-term payables 
expected to be available from a foreign supplier and its continuing efforts to 
obtain other financing sources, will be adequate to meet its seasonal working 
capital, capital expenditure and other requirements in 1995, there can be no 
assurances that the company will not experience liquidity problems in the 
future because of adverse market conditions or other unfavorable events.
  In addition, the company is reviewing possible significant capital investment 
projects over the next three years (which may require an amendment to the 
Credit Agreement) and options for additional financing that would be required 
to support these projects. If undertaken, the projects are expected to reduce 
the costs and increase production capacity primarily in the company's picture 
tube operations.

Note Three - Restructuring and Other Charges:
During the fourth quarter of 1993, the company recorded a charge of $31.0 
million primarily to restructure certain product areas and re-engineer its core 
Consumer Electronics and Network Systems business.  The restructuring 
affected computer monitors and magnetics, product areas that were phased-out or 
sold in 1994.  The fourth-quarter charge was primarily for non-cash fixed asset 
and inventory write-downs, as well as severance costs, and was designed to 
reduce fixed costs and operating expenses.
  During 1992, the company recorded $48.1 million of restructuring and other 
charges. These included provisions for severance, inventory valuation and other 
restructuring costs, along with write-offs of trade receivables. Designed to 
reduce fixed costs and operating expenses, the restructuring actions included 
manufacturing consolidations and related employment reductions in Mexico, 
consolidation of company-owned distribution and other activities, and salaried 
employment reductions throughout the company. 

Note Four - Income Taxes:
In the fourth quarter of 1992, the company elected early adoption of Statement 
of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 109, "Accounting for Income 
Taxes." The adoption had no effect on the financial statements of the company 
because the related net deferred tax assets were offset by a valuation 
allowance. The valuation allowance was established since the realization of 
these assets cannot be reasonably assured, given the company's recurring losses.
 
 The components of income taxes (credit) were:

  The $15.9 million income tax credit in 1992, resulted from the reversal of 
$10.0 million of previously accrued tax reserves no longer required in 
connection with earnings of a foreign subsidiary and $5.9 million of net 
operating loss carryback applications which resulted in cash refunds.

  As of December 31, 1994, the company had $388.5 million of net operating 
loss carryforwards (NOLs) available for financial statement purposes. For 
federal income tax purposes, the company had net operating loss carryforwards
of $389.3 million (which expire from 2004 through 2009) and unused tax credits 
of $5.6 million (which expire from 1995 through 2002).
  The company expects these NOLs and tax credits to be available in the future
to reduce the Federal income tax liability of the company. However, should
there occur a 50% "ownership change" of the company as defined under Section
382 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, the company's ability to utilize
the NOLs and available tax credits would be materially and adversely affected.
  A Registration Statement was filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission
in December 1994 covering 6.5 million shares of common stock which became
effective in February 1995 (the Offering). The Offering is not expected to
give rise to an ownership change of the company. The company has knowledge
of increases in the ownership of the company's common stock by 5% stockholders
aggregating approximately 35% in the three years ended December 31, 1994 (on
a pro forma basis, giving effect to the Offering, but without regard to
acquisitions of shares of common stock in the Offering by persons who might 
thereby become separate 5% stockholders). However, acquisitions of significant
interests in the company's common stock have occurred in the past, and future
stock transactions, which may not be within the control of the company, may
result in an ownership change when aggregated with the Offering and these other
past common stock transactions. 

Note Five - Geographic Segment Data:
The company's operations involve a dominant industry segment - the design, 
development, manufacture and sale of video products, including color television 
sets, video cassette recorders and other consumer electronics products, color 
picture tubes, cable TV products, computer monitors and parts and accessories 
for these products.
  
 Financial information, summarized by geographic area, is as follows:

   Foreign operations consist of manufacturing and sales subsidiaries in 
Mexico, a distribution subsidiary in Canada and a purchasing office in Taiwan. 
Sales to affiliates are principally accounted for at amounts based on local 
costs of production plus a reasonable return.

Note Six - Other Operating Expense (Income):
Major manufacturers of televisions and video cassette recorders agreed during 
1992 to take licenses under some of the company's U.S. tuning system patents 
(the licenses expire in 2003). Royalty income related to the tuning system 
patents (after deducting legal expenses) was $27.9 million, $25.7 million and 
$26.0 million in 1994, 1993 and 1992, respectively, and is included in Other 
operating expense (income). The $26.0 million in 1992 included $5.3 million of 
past royalties.

   During 1994 the company recorded $11.0 million of net gain on asset sales. 
Included in this amount is a $5.4 million gain on the sale of a warehouse in 
Northlake, Illinois, and a $3.6 million gain on the sale of vacant land 
adjacent to its Glenview, Illinois, headquarters. The company also sold a 
facility in Lenexa, Kansas, its power supply business, a facility in Chicago,
Illinois, and a facility in Springfield, Missouri. 

Note Nine - Short-term Debt and Credit Arrangements: 
The company entered into a Credit Agreement dated as of May 21, 1993, with a 
lending group led by General Electric Capital Corporation, for working capital 
purposes. Borrowings under the Credit Agreement are secured by accounts 
receivable, inventory, general intangibles, trademarks and the tuning system 
patent license agreements of the company and certain of its domestic 
subsidiaries. The Credit Agreement is scheduled to expire on June 30, 1996. The 
maximum commitment of funds available for borrowing under the Credit 
Agreement is $90 million, but is limited by a defined borrowing base formula 
related to eligible receivables and eligible inventory. Net proceeds arising 
from material asset transactions will result in a partial reduction in the 
maximum commitment of the lenders thereunder.  Interest on borrowings is based
on market rates with a commitment fee of 1/2 % per annum payable monthly on 
the unused balance of the facility. As of December 31, 1994, no borrowings 
were outstanding under the Credit Agreement.
  The Credit Agreement contains restrictive financial covenants that must be 
maintained as of the end of each fiscal quarter, including a liabilities to net 
worth ratio and a minimum net worth amount. The ratio of liabilities to net 
worth and minimum net worth amount varies from quarter to quarter. As of 
December 31, 1994, the ratio of liabilities to net worth was required to be not 
greater than 3.50 to 1.0 and was actually 1.86 to 1.0, and net worth was 
required to be equal to or greater than $158.0 million and was actually $228.3 
million. At the end of each fiscal quarter through March 30, 1996, the 
liabilities to net worth ratio is required to be maintained at various levels 
ranging from a high of 4.40 to 1.0 to a low of 3.50 to 1.0, and minimum net 
worth is required to be maintained at amounts ranging from a high of $166.0 
million to a low of $143.0 million. The Credit Agreement restricts the amount 
of capital expenditures by the company in each fiscal year. For the fiscal 
years 1994 and 1995, the company is permitted to make capital expenditures 
(as defined in the Credit Agreement) of up to $68.0 million and $38.0 million, 
respectively. In the event the company plans to undertake capital investment 
projects in 1995 which would exceed the permitted expenditures, the company 
would need to seek an amendment to the Credit Agreement. There can be no 
assurance that the lenders under the Credit Agreement will approve such an 
amendment, if requested by the company. 
  In addition, there are restrictions regarding investments, acquisitions, 
guaranties, transactions with affiliates, sales of assets, mergers and 
additional borrowings, along with limitations on liens. The Credit Agreement 
prohibits dividend payments on the company's common stock, restricts dividend 
payments on any of its preferred stock, if issued, and prohibits the 
redemption or repurchase of stock.

                                      ====================	

   In January 1994, the company redeemed its outstanding 12 1/8% notes due 
1995 at a redemption price equal to par value, totaling $34.5 million, plus 
accrued interest.
   The 6 1/4% convertible subordinated debentures are unsecured general 
obligations, subordinate in right of payment to certain other debt obligations, 
and are convertible into common stock at $31.25 per share. Terms of the 
debenture agreement include annual sinking-fund payments of $5.8 million 
beginning in 1997. The debentures are redeemable at the option of the company, 
in whole or in part, at specified redemption prices at par or above. 
   In November 1993 and January 1994, the company sold to certain institutional 
investors $55 million and $12 million, respectively, of 8.5% senior 
subordinated convertible debentures due 2000 and 2001, respectively. The 
debentures are unsecured general obligations, subordinate in right of payment
to certain other debt obligations, and are convertible into shares of common 
stock at an initial conversion price of  $9.76 per share and $10.00 per 
share, respectively. The debentures are redeemable at the option of the 
company, in whole or in part, at any time on or after November 19, 1997 and 
January 18, 1998, respectively, at specified redemption prices at par or above. 
   The fair value of long-term debt is $167.5 million as of December 31, 1994, 
as compared to the carrying amount of $182.0 million. The fair value of the 
6 1/4% convertible subordinated debentures is based on the quoted market price 
from the New York Stock Exchange. The fair value of the 8.5% convertible senior 
subordinated debentures is based on the quoted price obtained from third party 
financial institutions. Currently, the company's Credit Agreement would not 
allow the company to extinguish the long-term debt through purchase and 
thereby realize the gain.

                                      ======================================

  During 1994 and 1993 the company sold 8.6 million shares and 3.4 million 
shares, respectively, of authorized but unissued shares of common stock to 
investors under registration statements that had been filed with the Securities 
and Exchange Commission. A Registration Statement was filed with the Securities 
and Exchange Commission in December 1994 covering 6.5 million shares of 
common stock which became effective in February 1995. The shares of common 
stock may be sold by the company in an at-the-market equity offering(s) or on a 
negotiated or competitive bid basis through underwriters or dealers or directly 
to other purchasers or through agents.
  Pursuant to a Rights Agreement (as amended), a "right" entitling the holder 
thereof to purchase under certain conditions, one-half of one share of common 
stock at an exercise price of $37.50, subject to adjustment, was distributed 
with respect to each outstanding share of common stock in 1986, and with respect
to each additional share of common stock that has become outstanding since 
then. 
   The rights will become exercisable upon the earlier to occur of (i) the 10th 
day after a public announcement that a third party has become the beneficial 
owner of 25% or more of the outstanding common stock (an "acquiring person") 
or (ii) the 10th day after the commencement of, or the announcement of an 
intention to commence, an offer the consummation of which would result in 
a third party beneficially owning 25% or more of the common stock.
   In the event any person becomes an acquiring person, each holder of a right 
(other than the acquiring person) will thereafter have the right to receive 
upon exercise that number of shares of common stock having a market value of 
two times the exercise price of the right. The rights, which have no voting 
rights, expire in 1996. The rights may be redeemed at the option of the company 
at any time prior to such time as any person becomes an acquiring person. 
Under certain conditions and following a stockholder vote, the rights shall be 
redeemed by the company. In either case, the redemption price will be $.05 
per right, subject to adjustment. 
   The Rights Agreement also provides that under certain circumstances at any 
time after any person has become an acquiring person, the Board of Directors 
may exchange the rights (other than rights owned by such person) in whole or in 
part, for common stock at an exchange ratio of one-half of a share of common 
stock per right, subject to adjustment.
   At the company's Annual Meeting of Stockholders in May 1993, the 
stockholders approved the authorization of 8 million shares of preferred stock 
of which none are issued or outstanding as of December 31, 1994. The Board of 
Directors of the company is authorized to issue the preferred stock from time 
to time in one or more series and to determine all relevant terms of each such 
series, including but not limited to the following (i) whether and upon what 
terms, the shares of such series would be redeemable; (ii) whether a sinking 
fund would be provided for the redemption of the shares of such series and, 
if so, the terms thereof; and (iii) the preference, if any, to which shares of 
such series would be entitled in the event of voluntary or involuntary 
liquidation of the company.


Note Twelve - Stock Options and Awards:
The 1987 Stock Incentive Plan authorizes the granting of incentive and non-
qualified stock options, restricted stock awards and stock appreciation rights 
to key management personnel. The purchase price of shares under option is the 
market price of the shares on the date of grant. Options expire 10 years from 
the date granted.
   Transactions in 1994 and 1993 are summarized below:

                                         1994              1993

 Outstanding at December 31           6 3/8 - 13        6 3/8 -  9 3/4

   The company had 189,108 and 63,837 restricted stock awards issued and 
outstanding as of December 31, 1994 and 1993, respectively. The market value 
of the restricted shares is deferred in the additional paid-in capital account 
and amortized over the years the restrictions lapse. Total compensation 
expense in 1994 and 1993, related to these awards, was not material.

Note Thirteen - Retirement Plans and Employee Benefits: 
Virtually all employees in the United States and Canada are eligible to 
participate in noncontributory profit-sharing retirement plans after completing 
one full year of service. The plans provide for a minimum annual contribution 
of 6% of employees' eligible compensation. Contributions above the minimum 
could be required based upon profits in excess of a specified return on net 
worth. Profit-sharing contributions were $9.7 million, $9.7 million and $11.1 
million in 1994, 1993 and 1992, respectively. The 1994, 1993 and 1992 
contributions were partially funded through the issuance of approximately 
547,000, 1,021,000 and 982,000 shares, respectively, of the company's common 
stock.
   Employees in Mexico are covered by government-mandated plans, the costs of 
which are accrued by the company. 
   In the fourth quarter of 1993, the company elected early adoption of SFAS 
No.112, "Employers' Accounting for Postemployment Benefits." This statement 
requires that the company follow an accrual method of accounting for the 
benefits payable to employees when they leave the company other than by reason 
of retirement. Since most of these benefits were already accounted for by the 
company by the accrual method, adoption of SFAS No. 112 did not have a 
material effect on the financial statements of the company, nor is it expected 
to have a material effect on future results of operations.
   Presently, the company does not offer any postretirement benefits; as a 
result, the 1992 adoption of SFAS No. 106, "Employers' Accounting for 
Postretirement Benefits other than Pensions" did not have any effect on the 
financial statements of the company.


Note Fourteen - Contingencies:

In 1994, the company notified its 15 independent distributors of its intent to 
change to direct-to-retail distribution on a nationwide basis during the first 
half of 1995. In February 1995, one of the independent distributors filed suit 
challenging the company's right to discontinue the distributorship relationship 
and alleging that it has been damaged by certain of the company's practices. 
The lawsuit seeks injunctive relief, actual damages of $8 million, and punitive 
damages of $20 million.
   The company is involved in various other legal actions, environmental 
matters, patent claims, and other proceedings relating to a wide range of 
matters that are incidental to the conduct of its business. In addition, the 
company remains liable for certain retained obligations of a discontinued 
business, principally income and other taxes prior to the closing of the sale. 
The company believes, after reviewing such matters and consulting with the 
company's counsel, that any liability which may ultimately be incurred with 
respect to all of the above matters is not expected to have a material effect 
on either the company's consolidated financial position or results of 
operations.





                   REPORT OF INDEPENDENT PUBLIC ACCOUNTANTS



To the Stockholders of Zenith Electronics Corporation: 

We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Zenith 
Electronics Corporation (a Delaware corporation) and subsidiaries as of 
December 31, 1994 and 1993, and the related statements of consolidated 
operations and retained earnings and cash flows for each of the three years 
in the period ended December 31, 1994. These financial statements are the 
responsibility of the company's management. Our responsibility is to express 
an opinion on these financial statements based on our audits.
   We conducted our audits in accordance with generally accepted auditing 
standards. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain 
reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of 
material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence 
supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. An audit 
also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant 
estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial 
statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis 
for our opinion.
   In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above 
present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of Zenith 
Electronics Corporation and subsidiaries as of December 31, 1994 and 1993, 
and the results of their operations and their cash flows for each of the three 
years in the period ended December 31, 1994, in conformity with generally 
accepted accounting principles.

                       FINANCIAL STATEMENT SCHEDULE



To the Stockholders of Zenith Electronics Corporation:

We have audited, in accordance with generally accepted auditing standards, 
the consolidated financial statements included in Zenith Electronics 
Corporation's annual report to stockholders included in this Form 10-K, and 
have issued our report thereon dated February 14, 1995. Our audit was 
made for the purpose of forming an opinion on those statements taken as a 
whole. The following schedule is the responsibility of the Company's 
management and is presented for purposes of complying with the Securities 
and Exchange Commission's rules and is not part of the basic consolidated 
financial statements. This schedule has been subjected to the auditing 
procedures applied in the audit of the basic consolidated financial 
statements and, in our opinion, fairly states in all material respects the 
financial data required to be set forth therein in relation to the basic 
consolidated financial statements taken as a whole.

                            Zenith Electronics Corporation
                           1987 Zenith Stock Incentive Plan
                            Restricted Stock Award Agreement


THIS AGREEMENT, effective July 26, 1994, between Zenith Electronics 
Corporation, a Delaware corporation (the "Company"), and Jerry K. 
Pearlman (the "Participant"), is made pursuant to the provisions of the 1987 
Zenith Stock Incentive Plan (the "Plan").  The capitalized terms appearing 
in this Agreement shall have the definitions ascribed to them in the Plan 
unless specifically defined herein or in Attachment A to this Agreement.  In 
the event there is any inconsistency between the terms of this Agreement 
and the terms of the Plan, the terms of the Plan shall completely supersede 
and replace the terms of this Agreement.  In consideration of the premises 
set forth below, including the grant made herein, the parties hereto agree as 
follows:

    1.  This Agreement sets forth the terms and provisions of the grant to 
Participant of Forty Three Thousand Five Hundred Eighty One (43,581) 
shares of Company stock, subject to restrictions (the "Restricted Stock").  
Except as specifically provided otherwise herein, the shares of Restricted 
Stock shall be governed by the terms of the Plan.

    2.  Employment by the Company.  This Restricted Stock is awarded on 
the condition that the Participant satisfy the employment conditions set 
forth herein.

    However, neither such conditions nor the award of this Restricted Stock 
shall impose upon the Company any obligation to retain the Participant in 
its employ for any given period of time or upon any specific terms of 
employment nor interfere in anyway with the Company's right to 
terminate his employment at any time.

    3.  Restrictions. 

    (a)  Each certificate (or uncertificated account with the Company's 
transfer agent) representing shares of Restricted Stock hereunder shall bear 
(or be subject to) the following legend or restriction:

    "The shares of common stock represented by this certificate are subject 
to forfeiture under certain circumstances and may not be sold, assigned, 
transferred, pledged, or otherwise alienated by the registered holder except 
as permitted by the terms of the 1987 Zenith Stock Incentive Plan and a 
Restricted Stock Award Agreement dated July 26, 1994 between Zenith 
Electronics Corporation and Jerry K. Pearlman. A copy of the Plan and 
such Restricted Stock Award Agreement is on file with the Secretary of 
Zenith Electronics Corporation."

    (b)  Any Restricted Stock shall not be transferable by the Participant, 
whether voluntarily or involuntarily, by operation of law or otherwise, so 
long as it is subject to the restrictions of this paragraph.

    4.  Removal of Restrictions.

    (a)  Except as otherwise provided in Section 4(b) of this Agreement, Two 
Thousand Nine Hundred Five (2,905) shares of Restricted Stock governed 
by this Agreement shall become freely transferable by the Participant on 
each of the first through the fourteenth anniversaries of the Participant's 
sixty-fifth (65th) birthday and Two Thousand Nine Hundred Eleven (2,911) 
shares of Restricted Stock governed by the Agreement shall become freely 
transferable by the Participant on the fifteenth anniversary of the 
Participant's sixty-fifth (65th) birthday. 

    (b)  If the Participant shall notify the Secretary of the company, in 
writing, no later than the last business day of the calendar year immediately 
preceding the calendar year in which the Participant's sixty fifth (65th) 
birthday shall occur, that the Participant elects to receive on his sixty-fifth 
(65th) birthday one hundred percent (100%) of the shares of Stock 
governed by this Agreement free of all restrictions, then all of the shares of 
Restricted Stock governed by this Agreement shall become freely 
transferable by the Participant on the Participant's sixty-fifth (65th) 
birthday.

    (c)  When the shares are released from the restrictions and become fully 
transferable by the Participant in accordance with the terms of this 
Agreement, the Participant shall be entitled to receive a certificate or 
certificates representing such shares without the legend or restriction 
required by Section 3 herein.

    5.  Consulting Duties.  Beginning on the later to occur of: (i) the 
Participant's sixty-fifth (65th) birthday; or (ii) the Participant's 
termination of employment following his sixty-fifth (65th) birthday (other 
than by reason of death), and continuing until the Participant's eighty-first
(81st) birthday, the Participant agrees that he will, whenever reasonably 
requested by the Company, render assistance to the Company in the form of 
furnishing information to and cooperating with the Company in any matter 
relating to the business of the Company for not more than one (1) day 
during any calendar month, provided that inability of the Participant to 
render such assistance to the Company due to the Participant's physical or 
mental disability shall excuse the Participant of the obligation to render 
such assistance and shall not be deemed a breach of this Agreement and 
provided, further, that the refusal of the Participant to render such 
assistance beyond a twenty (20) mile radius of the Company's present 
offices in Glenview, Illinois shall not be deemed a breach of this 
Agreement.

    The Participant further agrees that during the twenty-four (24) calendar 
months beginning with the calendar month during which the Participant's 
termination of employment occurs, he will not, without the express written 
consent of the Company, engage in or render services of any kind in any 
capacity for any business that is competitive with the business of the 
Company or any entity controlled by the Company, and that he will not 
render assistance of any kind to or supply information to any such 
competitive business.

    In the event the Participant does not satisfy the consulting duties 
described in this Section 5, or if he violates the noncompetition covenant, 
all unvested shares of Restricted Stock shall immediately be forfeited to the 
Company.

    6.  Voting Rights and Dividends.  The Participant may exercise full 
voting rights and is entitled to receive all dividends and other distributions 
paid with respect to the shares of Restricted Stock while they are held in 
the name of Participant. If any such dividends or distributions are paid in 
shares of Common Stock of the Company, the shares shall be subject to 
the same restrictions on transferability as the shares of Restricted Stock 
with respect to which they were paid.

    7.   Termination By Reason of Death or Disability. In the event the 
Participant's employment is terminated by reason of death or Disability 
prior to the Participant's 65th birthday and prior to the time when all shares 
of Restricted Stock governed by this Agreement are all vested, then all 
shares of Restricted Stock subject to this Agreement shall immediately vest 
and as soon as administratively practicable, the stock certificates 
representing such shares of Restricted Stock without the restrictions or 
legend required by Section 3 herein, shall be delivered by the Company to 
the Participant or the Participant's beneficiary or estate, as the case may be.

     8.  Termination of Employment Prior to Age 65 for Other Reasons. 
Except as otherwise provided in Section 9 herein, in the event the 
Participant's employment is terminated for reasons other than those 
described in Section 7 prior to the Participant's sixty-fifth (65th) birthday, 
all shares of Restricted Stock subject to this Agreement shall immediately 
be forfeited to the Company by the Participant. 

    9.  Change in Control. In the event of a Qualifying Termination which 
occurs within the two (2) year period following a Change in Control, the 
restrictions imposed pursuant to Section 3 herein on shares of Restricted 
Stock subject to this Agreement shall lapse, and within ten (10) business 
days after the occurrence of the Qualifying Termination, the stock 
certificates representing the shares of Restricted Stock, without the 
restrictions or legend required by Section 3 herein thereon, shall be 
delivered by the Company to the Participant.

    10.  Adjustments for Changes in Capitalization. Appropriate adjustment 
shall be made by the Committee in the number of shares of Restricted 
Stock governed subject to this Agreement to give effect to any stock splits, 
stock dividends, and any other relevant changes in capitalization occurring 
after the effective date of this Agreement.

    11.  Administration. This Agreement and the rights of the Participant 
hereunder are subject to all the terms and conditions of the Plan, as the 
same may be amended from time to time, as well as to such rules and 
regulations as the Committee may adopt for administration of the Plan. It is 
expressly understood that the Committee is authorized to administer, 
construe, and make all determinations necessary or appropriate to the 
administration of the Plan and this Agreement, all of which shall be binding 
upon the Participant.

    12.  Miscellaneous.

     (a)  The Company shall have the authority to deduct or withhold, or 
require the Participant to remit to the Company, an amount sufficient to 
satisfy Federal, state, and local taxes (including the Participant's FICA 
obligation) required by law to be withheld with respect to any provision of 
this Agreement.

    (b)  This Agreement shall be subject to all applicable laws, rules, and 
regulations, and to such approvals by any governmental agencies or 
national securities exchanges as may be required.

    (c)  This Agreement shall be governed by, and construed in accordance 
with the laws of the State of Illinois (other than those relating to conflicts 
of law) to the extent not preempted by Federal law.

IN WITNESS WHEREOF, the parties have caused this Agreement 
to be executed this 17th day of January, 1995.

                               ATTACHMENT A

    1.  Change in Control.

    For purposes of this Agreement, "change in control of the Company" 
shall take place when either of the following events will have occurred:

        (a)  A third person, including a "group" as defined in Section l3(d)(3) 
of the Securities Exchange Act of l934, acquires shares of capital stock of 
the Company having twenty-five percent (25%) or more of the total 
number of votes that may be cast for the election of directors of the 
Company; or

        (b)  As a result of any tender or exchange offer, merger or other 
business combination, sale of assets or contested election, or any 
combination of the foregoing transactions (a "transaction") the persons 
who were directors of the Company before the transaction shall during any 
two consecutive years thereafter cease to constitute a majority of the Board 
of Directors of the Company.

    2.  Qualifying Termination.

        If a change or changes in control of the Company occurs, and within 
twenty-four (24) months from the date of any such change in control the 
Participant's employment is terminated, unless such termination is:

        A.  Because of the Participant's death, Retirement or Disability;

        B.  By the Company for Cause; or

        C.  By the Participant other than for Good Reason.

            (1)  Disability; Retirement.

                (a)  Termination by the Company of employment based on 
"Disability" shall mean termination because of the Participant's absence 
from his duties with the Company on a full-time basis for one hundred 
eighty (180) consecutive business days, as a result of incapacity due to 
injury or physical or mental illness.

                (b)  Termination by the Company or the Participant of 
employment based on "Retirement" shall, for the purposes of this 
Agreement, mean retirement at age seventy (70) or voluntary earlier 
retirement with the written consent of the Participant.

            (2)  Cause.

                Termination by the Company of employment for "Cause" shall 
mean termination upon:

                (a)  The willful and continued failure by the Participant to 
substantially perform his duties with the Company (other than any such 
failure resulting from his incapacity due to injury or physical or mental 
illness) after a demand for substantial performance is delivered to the 
Participant by the Company which specifically identifies the manner in 
which the Company believes that the Participant has not substantially 
performed his duties; or

                (b)  The willful engaging by the Participant in misconduct 
demonstrably injurious to the Company monetarily or otherwise.

                For purposes of this subparagraph (2), no act, or failure to 
act on the Participant's part, shall be considered "willful" unless done, or 
omitted to be done, by the Participant not in good faith and without reasonable 
belief that his action or omission was in the best interest of the Company.

                Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Participant shall not be 
deemed to have been terminated for Cause unless and until there shall have 
been delivered to the Participant a copy of a written Notice of Termination 
from the Company, after reasonable notice to the Participant and an 
opportunity for the Participant, together with his counsel, to be heard 
before the Board of Directors, finding that in the good faith opinion of the 
Board of Directors Cause existed and specifying the particulars thereof in 
detail.

            (3)  Good Reason.

                Termination by the Participant of employment for "Good 
Reason" shall mean termination based on any of the following which 
occurs within twenty-four (24) months from the date of a change in 
control:

                (a)  Without the Participant's express written consent, the 
assignment to the Participant of any duties materially inconsistent with the 
Participant's positions, duties, responsibilities and status with the Company 
immediately prior to a change in control, or a change (other than a bona 
fide promotion) in the Participant's title or office from that in effect 
immediately prior to a change in control, or any removal of the Participant 
from or any failure to re-elect the Participant to any of such positions, 
except in connection with the termination of his employment for Cause, 
Disability or Retirement or by death or by the Participant other than for 
Good Reason;

                (b)  A reduction by the Company in the Participant's salary 
as in effect on the date hereof or as the same may be increased from time to 
time, unless such reduction results from a blanket reduction of general 
applicability to exempt salaried personnel; or the failure by the Company 
to increase such base salary for the year in which a change of control 
occurs and each year thereafter by an amount which at least equals, on a 
percentage basis, the mean average percentage increase in base salary for 
all officers of the Company during the two full calendar years immediately 
preceding a change in control of the Company unless such failure is of 
general applicability to exempt salaried personnel;

                (c)  A failure by the Company to continue the Company's bonus 
incentive plans (the "Incentive Plans") as the same may be modified from 
time to time but substantially in the form in effect immediately prior to the 
change in control or a failure by the Company to continue the Participant 
as a participant in the Incentive Plans on at least the basis of his 
participation immediately prior to the change in control or to pay the 
Participant any installment of a previous award under the Incentive Plans;

				(d)	Without the Participant's 
express written consent, the Company requiring the Participant to 
be based anywhere other than within fifty (50) miles of his present 
office location, except for required travel on Company business to 
an extent substantially consistent with the Participant's business 
travel obligations immediately prior to such change in control;

                (e)  The failure by the Company to continue in effect any 
benefit or compensation plan, stock ownership, stock purchase or stock option 
plan, pension plan, life insurance plan, health and accident plan or long-
term disability plan in which the Participant is participating at the time of a 
change in control of the Company (or plans providing the Participant with 
substantially similar benefits) or the taking of any action by the Company 
which would materially adversely affect participation by the Participant in 
or materially reduce the Participant's benefits under any of such plans or 
deprive the Participant of any material fringe benefit enjoyed by the 
Participant at the time of the change in control;

                (f)  Any purported termination of the Participant's employment 
which is not effective pursuant to a Notice of Termination satisfying the 
requirements of subparagraph (4) below (and, if applicable, subparagraph 
(2) above).

                Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Participant agrees that in 
the event a third person begins a tender or exchange offer, circulates a proxy 
statement to shareholders or takes steps to effect a change in control of the 
Company, as defined in Section 1 hereof, the Participant will not thereafter 
voluntarily leave the employ of the Company until the third person has 
abandoned or terminated such efforts to effect a change in control; or if 
such efforts are successful, for ninety (90) days after a change in control of 
the Company shall have occurred.

            (4)  Notice of Termination.

                Any termination by the Company pursuant to subparagraphs (l) 
or (2) above or by the Participant pursuant to subparagraph (3) above shall 
be communicated by written "Notice of Termination" to the other party 
hereto.  For purposes of the Agreement, a "Notice of Termination" shall 
mean a notice which shall indicate the specific termination provision in the 
Agreement relied upon and shall set forth in reasonable detail the facts and 
circumstances claimed to provide a basis for termination of the Participant's 
employment under the provision so indicated.

            (5)  Date of Termination.

                "Date of Termination" shall mean:

                (a)  If the Participant's employment is terminated by reason of 
his death or Retirement, the date of death or retirement;

                (b)  If the Participant's employment is terminated for 
Disability, thirty (30) days after Notice of Termination is given (provided 
that the Participant shall not have returned to the performance of his 
duties on a full-time basis during such thirty (30) day period);

                (c)  If the Participant's employment is terminated by the 
Company for Cause pursuant to subparagraph (2) above, the date specified 
in the Notice of Termination;

                (d)  If the Participant's employment is terminated by the 
Participant for Good Reason, the date specified in the Notice of 
Termination; and

                (e)  If the Participant's employment is terminated for any 
other reason, the date on which a Notice of Termination is given.

                Notwithstanding the foregoing, if within thirty (30) days 
after any Notice of Termination is given the party receiving such Notice of 
Termination notifies the other party that a dispute exists concerning the 
termination, the Date of Termination shall be the date on which the dispute 
is finally determined, either by mutual written agreement of the parties or 
by a binding and final arbitration award or by a final judgment, order or 
decree of a court of competent jurisdiction entered upon such arbitration 
award (the time for appeal from such judgment, order or decree having 
expired and no appeal having been perfected).

terminate his employment at any time.

    3.  Restrictions. 

    (a)  Each certificate (or uncertificated account with the Company's 
transfer agent) representing shares of Restricted Stock hereunder shall bear 
(or be subject to) the following legend or restriction:

        "The shares of common stock represented by this certificate are 
subject to forfeiture under certain circumstances and may not be sold, 
assigned, transferred, pledged, or otherwise alienated by the registered 
holder except as permitted by the terms of the 1987 Zenith Stock Incentive 
Plan and a Restricted Stock Award Agreement dated July 26, 1994 between

Agreement is on file with the Secretary of Zenith Electronics Corporation."

    (b)  Any Restricted Stock shall not be transferable by the Participant, 
whether voluntarily or involuntarily, by operation of law or otherwise, so 
long as it is subject to the restrictions of this paragraph.

    4.  Removal of Restrictions.

    (a)  Except as otherwise provided in Section 4(b) of this Agreement,

    (b)  If the Participant shall notify the Secretary of the company, in

governed by this Agreement free of all restrictions, then all of the shares of 
Restricted Stock governed by this Agreement shall become freely 
transferable by the Participant on the Participant's sixty-fifth (65th)

(81st) birthday, the Participant agrees that he will, whenever reasonable 
requested by the Company, render assistance to the Company in the form of 
furnishing information to and cooperating with the Company in any matter 
relating to the business of the Company for not more than one (1) day 
during any calendar month, provided that inability of the Participant to 
render such assistance to the Company due to the Participant's physical or 
mental disability shall excuse the Participant of the obligation to render 
such assistance and shall not be deemed a breach of this Agreement and 
provided, further, that the refusal of the Participant to render such 
assistance beyond a twenty (20) mile radius of the Company's present 
offices in Glenview, Illinois shall not be deemed a breach of this 
Agreement.

    The Participant further agrees that during the twenty-four (24) calendar 
months beginning with the calendar month during which the Participant's 
termination of employment occurs, he will not, without the express written 
consent of the Company, engage in or render services of any kind in any 
capacity for any business that is competitive with the business of the 
Company or any entity controlled by the Company, and that he will not 
render assistance of any kind to or supply information to any such 
competitive business.

    In the event the Participant does not satisfy the consulting duties 
described in this Section 5, or if he violates the noncompetition covenant, 
all unvested shares of Restricted Stock shall immediately be forfeited to the 
Company.

    6.  Voting Rights and Dividends.  The Participant may exercise full 
voting rights and is entitled to receive all dividends and other distributions 
paid with respect to the shares of Restricted Stock while they are held in 
the name of Participant. If any such dividends or distributions are paid in 
shares of Common Stock of the Company, the shares shall be subject to 
the same restrictions on transferability as the shares of Restricted Stock 
with respect to which they were paid.

    7.  Termination By Reason of Death or Disability. In the event the 
Participant's employment is terminated by reason of death or Disability 
prior to the Participant's 65th birthday and prior to the time when all shares 
of Restricted Stock governed by this Agreement are all vested, then all 
shares of Restricted Stock subject to this Agreement shall immediately vest 
and as soon as administratively practicable, the stock certificates 
representing such shares of Restricted Stock without the restrictions or 
legend required by Section 3 herein, shall be delivered by the Company to 
the Participant or the Participant's beneficiary or estate, as the case may be.

    8.  Termination of Employment Prior to Age 65 for Other Reasons. 
Except as otherwise provided in Section 9 herein, in the event the 
Participant's employment is terminated for reasons other than those 
described in Section 7 prior to the Participant's sixty-fifth (65th) birthday, 
all shares of Restricted Stock subject to this Agreement shall immediately 
be forfeited to the Company by the Participant. 

    9.  Change in Control. In the event of a Qualifying Termination which 
occurs within the two (2) year period following a Change in Control, the 
restrictions imposed pursuant to Section 3 herein on shares of Restricted 
Stock subject to this Agreement shall lapse, and within ten (10) business 
days after the occurrence of the Qualifying Termination, the stock 
certificates representing the shares of Restricted Stock, without the 
restrictions or legend required by Section 3 herein thereon, shall be 
delivered by the Company to the Participant.

    10.  Adjustments for Changes in Capitalization. Appropriate adjustment 
shall be made by the Committee in the number of shares of Restricted 
Stock governed subject to this Agreement to give effect to any stock splits, 
stock dividends, and any other relevant changes in capitalization occurring 
after the effective date of this Agreement.

    11.  Administration. This Agreement and the rights of the Participant 
hereunder are subject to all the terms and conditions of the Plan, as the 
same may be amended from time to time, as well as to such rules and 
regulations as the Committee may adopt for administration of the Plan. It is 
expressly understood that the Committee is authorized to administer, 
construe, and make all determinations necessary or appropriate to the 
administration of the Plan and this Agreement, all of which shall be binding 
upon the Participant.

    12.  Miscellaneous.

    (a)  The Company shall have the authority to deduct or withhold, or 
require the Participant to remit to the Company, an amount sufficient to 
satisfy Federal, state, and local taxes (including the Participant's FICA 
obligation) required by law to be withheld with respect to any provision of 
this Agreement.

    (b)  This Agreement shall be subject to all applicable laws, rules, and 
regulations, and to such approvals by any governmental agencies or 
national securities exchanges as may be required.

    (c)  This Agreement shall be governed by, and construed in accordance 
with the laws of the State of Illinois (other than those relating to conflicts 
of law) to the extent not preempted by Federal law.

IN WITNESS WHEREOF, the parties have caused this Agreement to be 
executed this 7th day of February, 1995

                                ATTACHMENT A

    1.  Change in Control.

    For purposes of this Agreement, "change in control of the Company" 
shall take place when either of the following events will have occurred:

        (a)  A third person, including a "group" as defined in Section l3(d)(3) 
of the Securities Exchange Act of l934, acquires shares of capital stock of 
the Company having twenty-five percent (25%) or more of the total 
number of votes that may be cast for the election of directors of the 
Company; or

        (b)  As a result of any tender or exchange offer, merger or other 
business combination, sale of assets or contested election, or any 
combination of the foregoing transactions (a "transaction") the persons 
who were directors of the Company before the transaction shall during any 
two consecutive years thereafter cease to constitute a majority of the Board 
of Directors of the Company.

    2.  Qualifying Termination.

        If a change or changes in control of the Company occurs, and within 
twenty-four (24) months from the date of any such change in control the 
Participant's employment is terminated, unless such termination is:

        A.  Because of the Participant's death, Retirement or Disability;

        B.  By the Company for Cause; or

        C.  By the Participant other than for Good Reason.

            (1)  Disability; Retirement.

                (a)  Termination by the Company of employment based on 
"Disability" shall mean termination because of the Participant's absence 
from his duties with the Company on a full-time basis for one hundred 
eighty (180) consecutive business days, as a result of incapacity due to 
injury or physical or mental illness.

                (b)  Termination by the Company or the Participant of 
employment based on "Retirement" shall, for the purposes of this 
Agreement, mean retirement at age seventy (70) or voluntary earlier 
retirement with the written consent of the Participant.

            (2)  Cause.

                Termination by the Company of employment for "Cause" shall 
mean termination upon:

                (a)  The willful and continued failure by the Participant to 
substantially perform his duties with the Company (other than any such 
failure resulting from his incapacity due to injury or physical or mental 
illness) after a demand for substantial performance is delivered to the 
Participant by the Company which specifically identifies the manner in 
which the Company believes that the Participant has not substantially 
performed his duties; or

                (b)  The willful engaging by the Participant in misconduct 
demonstrably injurious to the Company monetarily or otherwise.

                For purposes of this subparagraph (2), no act, or failure to 
act on the Participant's part, shall be considered "willful" unless done, or 
omitted to be done, by the Participant not in good faith and without reasonable 
belief that his action or omission was in the best interest of the Company.

                Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Participant shall not be 
deemed to have been terminated for Cause unless and until there shall have 
been delivered to the Participant a copy of a written Notice of Termination 
from the Company, after reasonable notice to the Participant and an 
opportunity for the Participant, together with his counsel, to be heard 
before the Board of Directors, finding that in the good faith opinion of the 
Board of Directors Cause existed and specifying the particulars thereof in 
detail.

            (3)  Good Reason.

                Termination by the Participant of employment for "Good 
Reason" shall mean termination based on any of the following which 
occurs within twenty-four (24) months from the date of a change in 
control:

                (a)  Without the Participant's express written consent, the 
assignment to the Participant of any duties materially inconsistent with the 
Participant's positions, duties, responsibilities and status with the Company 
immediately prior to a change in control, or a change (other than a bona 
fide promotion) in the Participant's title or office from that in effect 
immediately prior to a change in control, or any removal of the Participant 
from or any failure to re-elect the Participant to any of such positions, 
except in connection with the termination of his employment for Cause, 
Disability or Retirement or by death or by the Participant other than for 
Good Reason;

                (b)  A reduction by the Company in the Participant's salary 
as in effect on the date hereof or as the same may be increased from time to 
time, unless such reduction results from a blanket reduction of general 
applicability to exempt salaried personnel; or the failure by the Company 
to increase such base salary for the year in which a change of control 
occurs and each year thereafter by an amount which at least equals, on a 
percentage basis, the mean average percentage increase in base salary for 
all officers of the Company during the two full calendar years immediately 
preceding a change in control of the Company unless such failure is of 
general applicability to exempt salaried personnel;

                (c)  A failure by the Company to continue the Company's bonus 
incentive plans (the "Incentive Plans") as the same may be modified from 
time to time but substantially in the form in effect immediately prior to the 
change in control or a failure by the Company to continue the Participant 
as a participant in the Incentive Plans on at least the basis of his 
participation immediately prior to the change in control or to pay the 
Participant any installment of a previous award under the Incentive Plans;

                (d)  Without the Participant's express written consent, the 
Company requiring the Participant to be based anywhere other than within 
fifty (50) miles of his present office location, except for required travel on 
Company business to an extent substantially consistent with the 
Participant's business travel obligations immediately prior to such change 
in control;

                (e)  The failure by the Company to continue in effect any 
benefit or compensation plan, stock ownership, stock purchase or stock option 
plan, pension plan, life insurance plan, health and accident plan or long-
term disability plan in which the Participant is participating at the time of a 
change in control of the Company (or plans providing the Participant with 
substantially similar benefits) or the taking of any action by the Company 
which would materially adversely affect participation by the Participant in 
or materially reduce the Participant's benefits under any of such plans or 
deprive the Participant of any material fringe benefit enjoyed by the 
Participant at the time of the change in control;

                (f)  Any purported termination of the Participant's employment 
which is not effective pursuant to a Notice of Termination satisfying the 
requirements of subparagraph (4) below (and, if applicable, subparagraph 
(2) above).

                Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Participant agrees that in 
the event a third person begins a tender or exchange offer, circulates a proxy 
statement to shareholders or takes steps to effect a change in control of the 
Company, as defined in Section 1 hereof, the Participant will not thereafter 
voluntarily leave the employ of the Company until the third person has 
abandoned or terminated such efforts to effect a change in control; or if 
such efforts are successful, for ninety (90) days after a change in control of 
the Company shall have occurred.

            (4)  Notice of Termination.

                Any termination by the Company pursuant to subparagraphs (l) 
or (2) above or by the Participant pursuant to subparagraph (3) above shall 
be communicated by written "Notice of Termination" to the other party 
hereto.  For purposes of the Agreement, a "Notice of Termination" shall 
mean a notice which shall indicate the specific termination provision in the 
Agreement relied upon and shall set forth in reasonable detail the facts and 
circumstances claimed to provide a basis for termination of the Participant's 
employment under the provision so indicated.

            (5)  Date of Termination.

                "Date of Termination" shall mean:

                (a)  If the Participant's employment is terminated by reason 
of his death or Retirement, the date of death or retirement;

                (b)  If the Participant's employment is terminated for 
Disability, thirty (30) days after Notice of Termination is given (provided 
that the Participant shall not have returned to the performance of his duties 
on a full-time basis during such thirty (30) day period);

                (c)  If the Participant's employment is terminated by the 
Company for Cause pursuant to subparagraph (2) above, the date specified 
in the Notice of Termination;

                (d)  If the Participant's employment is terminated by the 
Participant for Good Reason, the date specified in the Notice of 
Termination; and

                (e)  If the Participant's employment is terminated for any 
other reason, the date on which a Notice of Termination is given.

                Notwithstanding the foregoing, if within thirty (30) days 
after any Notice of Termination is given the party receiving such Notice of 
Termination notifies the other party that a dispute exists concerning the 
termination, the Date of Termination shall be the date on which the dispute 
is finally determined, either by mutual written agreement of the parties or 
by a binding and final arbitration award or by a final judgment, order or 
decree of a court of competent jurisdiction entered upon such arbitration 
award (the time for appeal from such judgment, order or decree having 
expired and no appeal having been perfected).

                          Zenith Electronics Corporation
                         1987 Zenith Stock Incentive Plan
                          Restricted Stock Award Agreement


THIS AGREEMENT, effective July 26, 1994, between Zenith Electronics 
Corporation, a Delaware corporation (the "Company"), and Gerald M. 
McCarthy (the "Participant"), is made pursuant to the provisions of the 
1987 Zenith Stock Incentive Plan (the "Plan").  The capitalized terms 
appearing in this Agreement shall have the definitions ascribed to them in 
the Plan unless specifically defined herein or in Attachment A to this 
Agreement.  In the event there is any inconsistency between the terms of 
this Agreement and the terms of the Plan, the terms of the Plan shall 
completely supersede and replace the terms of this Agreement.  In 
consideration of the premises set forth below, including the grant made 
herein, the parties hereto agree as follows:

    1.  This Agreement sets forth the terms and provisions of the grant to 
Participant of Twenty Two Thousand Four Hundred Thirty Two (22,432) 
shares of Company stock, subject to restrictions (the "Restricted Stock").  
Except as specifically provided otherwise herein, the shares of Restricted 
Stock shall be governed by the terms of the Plan.

    2.  Employment by the Company.  This Restricted Stock is awarded on 
the condition that the Participant satisfy the employment conditions set 
forth herein.

    However, neither such conditions nor the award of this Restricted Stock 
shall impose upon the Company any obligation to retain the Participant in 
its employ for any given period of time or upon any specific terms of 
employment nor interfere in anyway with the Company's right to 
terminate his employment at any time.

    3.  Restrictions. 

    (a)  Each certificate (or uncertificated account with the Company's 
transfer agent) representing shares of Restricted Stock hereunder shall bear 
(or be subject to) the following legend or restriction:

        "The shares of common stock represented by this certificate are 
subject to forfeiture under certain circumstances and may not be sold, 
assigned, transferred, pledged, or otherwise alienated by the registered 
holder except as permitted by the terms of the 1987 Zenith Stock Incentive 
Plan and a Restricted Stock Award Agreement dated July 26, 1994 between 
Zenith Electronics Corporation and Gerald M. McCarthy. A copy of the 
Plan and such Restricted Stock Award Agreement is on file with the 
Secretary of Zenith Electronics Corporation."

    (b)  Any Restricted Stock shall not be transferable by the Participant, 
whether voluntarily or involuntarily, by operation of law or otherwise, so 
long as it is subject to the restrictions of this paragraph.

    4.  Removal of Restrictions.

    (a)  Except as otherwise provided in Section 4(b) of this Agreement, One 
Thousand Four Hundred Ninety Five (1,495) shares of Restricted Stock 
governed by this Agreement shall become freely transferable by the 
Participant on each of the first through the fourteenth anniversaries of the 
Participant's sixty-fifth (65th) birthday and One Thousand Five Hundred 
Two (1,502) shares of Restricted Stock governed by the Agreement shall 
become freely transferable by the Participant on the fifteenth anniversary 
of the Participant's sixty-fifth (65th) birthday. 

    (b)  If the Participant shall notify the Secretary of the day of the 
calendar year immediately preceding the calendar year in which the 
Participant's sixty fifth (65th) birthday shall occur, that the Participant
elects to receive on his sixty-fifth (65th) birthday one hundred percent 
(100%) of the shares of Stock governed by this Agreement free of all 
restrictions, then all of the shares of Restricted Stock governed by this 
Agreement shall become freely transferable by the Participant on the 
Participant's sixty-fifth (65th) birthday.

    (c)  When the shares are released from the restrictions and become fully 
transferable by the Participant in accordance with the terms of this 
Agreement, the Participant shall be entitled to receive a certificate or 
certificates representing such shares without the legend or restriction 
required by Section 3 herein.

    5.  Consulting Duties.  Beginning on the later to occur of: (i) the 
Participant's sixty-fifth (65th) birthday; or (ii) the Participant's 
termination of employment following his sixty-fifth (65th) birthday (other 
than by reason of death), and continuing until the Participant's eighty-first
(81st) birthday, the Participant agrees that he will, whenever reasonably 
requested by the Company, render assistance to the Company in the form of 
furnishing information to and cooperating with the Company in any matter 
relating to the business of the Company for not more than one (1) day 
during any calendar month, provided that inability of the Participant to 
render such assistance to the Company due to the Participant's physical or 
mental disability shall excuse the Participant of the obligation to render 
such assistance and shall not be deemed a breach of this Agreement and 
provided, further, that the refusal of the Participant to render such 
assistance beyond a twenty (20) mile radius of the Company's present 
offices in Glenview, Illinois shall not be deemed a breach of this 
Agreement.

    The Participant further agrees that during the twenty-four (24) calendar 
months beginning with the calendar month during which the Participant's 
termination of employment occurs, he will not, without the express written 
consent of the Company, engage in or render services of any kind in any 
capacity for any business that is competitive with the business of the 
Company or any entity controlled by the Company, and that he will not 
render assistance of any kind to or supply information to any such 
competitive business.

    In the event the Participant does not satisfy the consulting duties 
described in this Section 5, or if he violates the noncompetition covenant, 
all unvested shares of Restricted Stock shall immediately be forfeited to the 
Company.

    6.  Voting Rights and Dividends.  The Participant may exercise full 
voting rights and is entitled to receive all dividends and other distributions 
paid with respect to the shares of Restricted Stock while they are held in 
the name of Participant. If any such dividends or distributions are paid in 
shares of Common Stock of the Company, the shares shall be subject to 
the same restrictions on transferability as the shares of Restricted Stock 
with respect to which they were paid.

    7.   Termination By Reason of Death or Disability. In the event the 
Participant's employment is terminated by reason of death or Disability 
prior to the Participant's 65th birthday and prior to the time when all shares 
of Restricted Stock governed by this Agreement are all vested, then all 
shares of Restricted Stock subject to this Agreement shall immediately vest 
and as soon as administratively practicable, the stock certificates 
representing such shares of Restricted Stock without the restrictions or 
legend required by Section 3 herein, shall be delivered by the Company to 
the Participant or the Participant's beneficiary or estate, as the case may be.

    8.  Termination of Employment Prior to Age 65 for Other Reasons. 
Except as otherwise provided in Section 9 herein, in the event the 
Participant's employment is terminated for reasons other than those 
described in Section 7 prior to the Participant's sixty-fifth (65th) birthday, 
all shares of Restricted Stock subject to this Agreement shall immediately 
be forfeited to the Company by the Participant. 

    9.  Change in Control. In the event of a Qualifying Termination which 
occurs within the two (2) year period following a Change in Control, the 
restrictions imposed pursuant to Section 3 herein on shares of Restricted 
Stock subject to this Agreement shall lapse, and within ten (10) business 
days after the occurrence of the Qualifying Termination, the stock 
certificates representing the shares of Restricted Stock, without the 
restrictions or legend required by Section 3 herein thereon, shall be 
delivered by the Company to the Participant.

    10.  Adjustments for Changes in Capitalization. Appropriate adjustment 
shall be made by the Committee in the number of shares of Restricted 
Stock governed subject to this Agreement to give effect to any stock splits, 
stock dividends, and any other relevant changes in capitalization occurring 
after the effective date of this Agreement.

    11.  Administration. This Agreement and the rights of the Participant 
hereunder are subject to all the terms and conditions of the Plan, as the 
same may be amended from time to time, as well as to such rules and 
regulations as the Committee may adopt for administration of the Plan. It is 
expressly understood that the Committee is authorized to administer, 
construe, and make all determinations necessary or appropriate to the 
administration of the Plan and this Agreement, all of which shall be binding 
upon the Participant.

    12.  Miscellaneous.

require the Participant to remit to the Company, an amount sufficient to 
satisfy Federal, state, and local taxes (including the Participant's FICA 
obligation) required by law to be withheld with respect to any provision of 
this Agreement.

                                 ATTACHMENT A

    1.  Change in Control.

    For purposes of this Agreement, "change in control of the Company" 
shall take place when either of the following events will have occurred:

        (a)  A third person, including a "group" as defined in Section l3(d)(3) 
of the Securities Exchange Act of l934, acquires shares of capital stock of 
the Company having twenty-five percent (25%) or more of the total 
number of votes that may be cast for the election of directors of the 
Company; or

        (b)  As a result of any tender or exchange offer, merger or other 
business combination, sale of assets or contested election, or any 
combination of the foregoing transactions (a "transaction") the persons 
who were directors of the Company before the transaction shall during any 
two consecutive years thereafter cease to constitute a majority of the Board 
of Directors of the Company.

    2.  Qualifying Termination.

        If a change or changes in control of the Company occurs, and within 
twenty-four (24) months from the date of any such change in control the 
Participant's employment is terminated, unless such termination is:

        A.  Because of the Participant's death, Retirement or Disability;

        B.  By the Company for Cause; or

        C.  By the Participant other than for Good Reason.

                (1)  Disability; Retirement.

                (a)  Termination by the Company of employment based on 
"Disability" shall mean termination because of the Participant's absence 
from his duties with the Company on a full-time basis for one hundred 
eighty (180) consecutive business days, as a result of incapacity due to 
injury or physical or mental illness.

                (b)  Termination by the Company or the Participant of 
employment based on "Retirement" shall, for the purposes of this 
Agreement, mean retirement at age seventy (70) or voluntary earlier

                Termination by the Company of employment for "Cause" shall 
mean termination upon:

                (a)  The willful and continued failure by the Participant to 
substantially perform his duties with the Company (other than any such 
failure resulting from his incapacity due to injury or physical or mental 
illness) after a demand for substantial performance is delivered to the 
Participant by the Company which specifically identifies the manner in 
which the Company believes that the Participant has not substantially 
performed his duties; or

                (b)  The willful engaging by the Participant in misconduct 
demonstrably injurious to the Company monetarily or otherwise.

                For purposes of this subparagraph (2), no act, or failure to 
act on the Participant's part, shall be considered "willful" unless done, or 
omitted to be done, by the Participant not in good faith and without reasonable 
belief that his action or omission was in the best interest of the Company.

                Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Participant shall not be

assignment to the Participant of any duties materially inconsistent with the 
Participant's positions, duties, responsibilities and status with the Company 
immediately prior to a change in control, or a change (other than a bona 
fide promotion) in the Participant's title or office from that in effect 
immediately prior to a change in control, or any removal of the Participant 
from or any failure to re-elect the Participant to any of such positions, 
except in connection with the termination of his employment for Cause, 
Disability or Retirement or by death or by the Participant other than for 
Good Reason;

                (b)  A reduction by the Company in the Participant's salary 
as in effect on the date hereof or as the same may be increased from time to 
time, unless such reduction results from a blanket reduction of general 
applicability to exempt salaried personnel; or the failure by the Company 
to increase such base salary for the year in which a change of control 
occurs and each year thereafter by an amount which at least equals, on a 
percentage basis, the mean average percentage increase in base salary for 
all officers of the Company during the two full calendar years immediately 
preceding a change in control of the Company unless such failure is of 
general applicability to exempt salaried personnel;

                (c)  A failure by the Company to continue the Company's bonus 
incentive plans (the "Incentive Plans") as the same may be modified from 
time to time but substantially in the form in effect immediately prior to the 
change in control or a failure by the Company to continue the Participant 
as a participant in the Incentive Plans on at least the basis of his 
participation immediately prior to the change in control or to pay the 
Participant any installment of a previous award under the Incentive Plans;

                (d)  Without the Participant's express written consent, the 
Company requiring the Participant to be based anywhere other than within 
fifty (50) miles of his present office location, except for required travel on 
Company business to an extent substantially consistent with the 
Participant's business travel obligations immediately prior to such change 
in control;

                (e)  The failure by the Company to continue in effect any 
benefit or compensation plan, stock ownership, stock purchase or stock option 
plan, pension plan, life insurance plan, health and accident plan or long-
term disability plan in which the Participant is participating at the time of a 
change in control of the Company (or plans providing the Participant with 
substantially similar benefits) or the taking of any action by the Company 
which would materially adversely affect participation by the Participant in 
or materially reduce the Participant's benefits under any of such plans or 
deprive the Participant of any material fringe benefit enjoyed by the 
Participant at the time of the change in control;

                (f)  Any purported termination of the Participant's employment 
which is not effective pursuant to a Notice of Termination satisfying the 
requirements of subparagraph (4) below (and, if applicable, subparagraph 
(2) above).

                Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Participant agrees that in 
the event a third person begins a tender or exchange offer, circulates a proxy 
statement to shareholders or takes steps to effect a change in control of the 
Company, as defined in Section 1 hereof, the Participant will not thereafter 
voluntarily leave the employ of the Company until the third person has 
abandoned or terminated such efforts to effect a change in control; or if 
such efforts are successful, for ninety (90) days after a change in control of 
the Company shall have occurred.

            (4)  Notice of Termination.

                Any termination by the Company pursuant to subparagraphs (l) 
or (2) above or by the Participant pursuant to subparagraph (3) above shall 
be communicated by written "Notice of Termination" to the other party 
hereto.  For purposes of the Agreement, a "Notice of Termination" shall 
mean a notice which shall indicate the specific termination provision in the 
Agreement relied upon and shall set forth in reasonable detail the facts and 
circumstances claimed to provide a basis for termination of the Participant's 
employment under the provision so indicated.

            (5)  Date of Termination.

                "Date of Termination" shall mean:

                (a)  If the Participant's employment is terminated by reason of 
his death or Retirement, the date of death or retirement;

                (b)  If the Participant's employment is terminated for 
Disability, thirty (30) days after Notice of Termination is given (provided 
that the Participant shall not have returned to the performance of his duties
on a full-time basis during such thirty (30) day period);

                (c)  If the Participant's employment is terminated by the 
Company for Cause pursuant to subparagraph (2) above, the date specified 
in the Notice of Termination;

                (d)  If the Participant's employment is terminated by the 
Participant for Good Reason, the date specified in the Notice of 
Termination; and

                (e)  If the Participant's employment is terminated for any 
other reason, the date on which a Notice of Termination is given.

                Notwithstanding the foregoing, if within thirty (30) days after 
any Notice of Termination is given the party receiving such Notice of 
Termination notifies the other party that a dispute exists concerning the 
termination, the Date of Termination shall be the date on which the dispute 
is finally determined, either by mutual written agreement of the parties or 
by a binding and final arbitration award or by a final judgment, order or 
decree of a court of competent jurisdiction entered upon such arbitration 
award (the time for appeal from such judgment, order or decree having 
expired and no appeal having been perfected).

and shall mean a Participant's total annual base salary, without taking into

to the Plan Date, and if such shares are specifically designated by the

shall be deemed to be included within the Restricted Stock Offset.  
However, in the event any or all of such shares of restricted stock described 
in this Section 2.18 are or have been forfeited by a Participant on or before 
Retirement, the value attributable to such forfeited shares shall not be 
deemed to be included within the definition of the term "Restricted Stock 
Offset."

        5.2  Forfeiture.

        a)  Less than 10 Years of Credited Service. Regardless of a 
Participant's age upon a termination of his or her employment, the 
Participant shall forfeit his or her right to any and all benefits set forth in 
this Plan unless, at the time of such termination, the Participant has 
completed at least ten (10) years of Credited Service.

        b)  Prior to Age 55. In the event that a Participant's employment 
terminates prior to age fifty-five (55) for any reason, then such Participant

this Plan.

        c)  Termination For Cause Prior to Age 65. In the event that a 
Participant's employment terminates for Cause prior to age sixty-five (65), 
such Participant shall forfeit his or her right to receive any and all benefits 
under this Plan.

not limited to, the ten- (10-) year minimum Credited Service requirement, a 
Participant's right to receive the benefits set forth in this Plan shall be 
nonforfeitable following such Participant's attainment of age sixty-five (65).

Article 6. Amount, Form, and Payment of Supplemental Benefit
        6.1  Normal Retirement Benefit. Subject to the terms of the Plan, the 
Normal Retirement Benefit shall be the lump sum payable (regardless of 
the form in which such benefit actually is paid) in connection with 
Retirement at Normal Retirement Age, and will equal the amount specified 
in (a) less (b) below:

        a)  The lump-sum Actuarial Equivalent at Normal Retirement Age of a 
straight-life annuity where each annual payment equals fifty percent (50%) 
of the Participant's Final Average Earnings; multiplied by  a fraction, the 
numerator of which is the Participant's total number of years of Credited 
Service (up to a maximum of twenty-five (25) years), and the denominator 
of which is twenty-five (25); less

        b)  The Participant's Other Retirement Income.

    This amount will be payable in a lump sum or other payment schedule 
having the same Actuarial Equivalent value as such lump sum, as specified 
in Section 6.4. All calculations hereunder shall be made by the Committee 
or its designate.

        6.2  Early Retirement Benefit. Subject to the terms of this Plan, the

form in which such benefit actually is paid) in connection with Retirement 
at Early Retirement Age, and shall equal (a) less (b) below:

        a)  The amount specified in Section 6.1(a) herein, reduced by one-
fourth of one percent for each full calendar month by which the 
Participant's date of termination of employment precedes his or her sixty-
fifth (65th) birthday (provided that such reduction shall apply only for a 
maximum of thirty-six (36) months), and by five-twelfths of one percent 
for each full calendar month by which the Participant's date of termination 
of employment precedes his or her sixty-second (62nd) birthday; less

        b)  The Participant's Other Retirement Income 

        6.3  Commencement of Benefits. Benefits payable in accordance with 
Section 6.1 or 6.2 herein shall commence on the first day of the month 
following the effective date of the Participant's employment termination, 
and shall continue to be paid as set forth in Section 6.4 herein. 

        6.4  Form of Benefit. Each Participant shall make an irrevocable 
election designating the form of payment he or she desires with respect to 
his or her benefits hereunder. Such election shall be effective only in the 
event it is delivered to the Company within a calendar year which precedes 
the calendar year in which the Participant Retires.  In the event such 
election is not made in a calendar year prior to the calendar year in which 
the Participant Retires, the Participant's benefit shall be paid as set forth
in Section 6.4(b) herein.  The aggregate payments under each of the payment 
alternatives shall represent approximately the same Actuarial Equivalent 
value, determined at the sole discretion of the Committee. The following 
payment alternatives are available:

        (a)  Lump Sum. A cash lump-sum payment, as set forth in Section 6.1 
or 6.2 herein, as applicable. In the event this payment alternative is 
selected, the Company shall make the cash lump-sum payment to the Participant 
within thirty (30) days following the date on which the benefits become 
due and payable.
        (b)  Fifteen-Year Certain. In the event this payment alternative is 
selected, the Participant, shall receive equal monthly payments, each of 
which equals one-one hundred eightieth (1/180th) of the Actuarial 
Equivalent of the benefits set forth in this Article 6, as if they were payable 
for the lifetime of the Participant pursuant to a straight-life annuity, 
determined at the discretion of the Committee or its designate. Such 
payments shall begin within thirty (30) days following the date on which 
the benefits become due and payable, and shall continue for the entire 
fifteen- (15-) year period. In the event this payment alternative is selected, 
the Participant shall designate a beneficiary to whom remaining payments 
will be made in the event of his or her death prior to the end of such 
fifteen- (15-) year period.

Article 7. Rights of Participants
        7.1  Contractual Obligation. The Plan shall create a contractual 
obligation on the part of the Company to make the payments described 
under the Plan. Such payments shall be made out of the general funds of 
the Company.

        7.2  Unsecured Interest. No Participant or party claiming an interest 
under the Plan shall have any interest whatsoever in any specific asset of 
the Company. To the extent that any party acquires a right to receive 
payments under the Plan, such right shall be equivalent to that of an 
unsecured general creditor of the Company.


    The Company may establish one or more trusts, with such trustee as the 
Committee or its designate may approve, for the purpose of providing for 
the payment of benefits hereunder. Such trust or trusts may be irrevocable, 
but the assets thereof shall be subject to the claims of the Company's 
general creditors. To the extent any benefits payable under the Plan are 
actually paid from any such trust, the Company shall have no further 
obligation with respect thereto, but to the extent not so paid, such benefits 
shall remain the obligation of, and shall be paid by, the Company.

        7.3  Employment. Nothing in the Plan shall interfere with nor limit in 
any way the right of the Company to terminate any Participant's 
employment at any time, nor confer upon any Participant any right to 
continue in the employ of the Company.

        7.4  Participation. No Employee shall have the right to be selected as 
a Participant. 

Article 8. Withholding of Taxes
    The Company shall have the authority to deduct or withhold, or require 
Participants to remit to the Company an amount sufficient to satisfy 
Federal, state, and local withholding tax requirements (including the 
Participant's FICA obligation) required by law to be withheld with respect 
to any provision of this Plan.

Article 9. Amendment and Termination
    The Company hereby reserves the right to amend, modify, or terminate 
the Plan at any time by action of the Committee. Except as described 
below in this Article 9, no such amendment or termination shall in any 
material manner adversely affect any Participant's rights to benefits payable 
hereunder, without the consent of the Participant.

    The Plan is intended to be an unfunded plan maintained primarily to 
provide deferred compensation benefits for a select group of "management 
or highly compensated employees" within the meaning of Sections 201, 
301, and 401 of ERISA, and therefore to be exempt from the provisions of 
Parts 2, 3, and 4 of Title I of ERISA. Accordingly, the Committee may 
terminate the Plan and commence termination payout for all or certain 
Participants, or remove certain Employees as Participants, if it is 
determined by the United States Department of Labor or a court of 
competent jurisdiction that the Plan constitutes an employee pension 
benefit plan within the meaning of Section 3(2) of ERISA which is not so 
exempt. If payout is commenced pursuant to the operation of this Article 9, 
the payment of such amounts shall be made in the manner, and at the 
times selected by the Committee; provided, however, that such payment 
shall not be extended for a longer period of time than would have been the 
case had the account balance payouts occurred as scheduled immediately 
prior to such accelerated payout.

Article 10. Beneficiaries
    Each Participant shall be entitled to designate one (1) or more 
beneficiaries of the Participant under this Plan. All designations shall be 
signed by the Participant, and shall be in such form as prescribed by the 
Committee or its designate. Each designation shall be effective as of the 
date received by the Company. 

    Participants may change their designations of beneficiary on such form 
as prescribed by the Committee or its designate. The payment of amounts 
payable under the Plan shall be in accordance with the last unrevoked 
written designation of beneficiary that has been signed by the Participant 
and delivered by the Participant to the Company prior to the Participant's 
death.

    In the event that all the beneficiaries named by a Participant pursuant to 
this Article 10 predecease the Participant, the amounts that would have 
been paid to the Participant or the Participant's beneficiaries under this Plan 
shall be paid to the Participant's estate.

    In the event a Participant does not designate a beneficiary, or for any 
reason such designation is ineffective, in whole or in part, the amounts that 
otherwise would have been paid to the Participant or the Participant's 
beneficiaries under the Plan shall be paid to the Participant's estate.

Article 11. Miscellaneous
    11.1  Notice. Any notice or filing required or permitted to be given to the 
Company under the Plan shall be sufficient if in writing and hand 
delivered, or sent by registered or certified mail to the Corporate Secretary 
of the Company. Notice to the Corporate Secretary of the Company, if 
mailed, shall be addressed to the principal executive offices of the 
Company. Notice mailed to a Participant shall be at such address as is 
given in the records of the Company. Notices shall be deemed given as of 
the date of delivery or, if delivery is made by mail, as of the date shown on 
the postmark on the receipt for registration or certification.

    11.2  Nontransferability. Except as provided in Article 10 herein, 
Participants' rights to amounts payable under the Plan may not be sold, 
transferred, assigned, or otherwise alienated or hypothecated, other than by 
will or by the laws of descent and distribution. In no event shall the 
Company make any payment under the Plan to any assignee or creditor of 
a Participant.

    11.3  Severability. In the event any provision of the Plan shall be held 
illegal or invalid for any reason, the illegality or invalidity shall not 
affect the remaining parts of the Plan, and the Plan shall be construed and 
enforced as if the illegal or invalid provision had not been included.

    11.4  Gender and Number. Except where otherwise indicated by the 
context, any masculine term used herein also shall include the feminine; 
the plural shall include the singular, and the singular shall include the 
plural.

    11.5  Costs of the Plan. All costs of implementing and administering the 
Plan shall be borne by the Company.

    11.6  Applicable Law. The Plan shall be governed by and construed in 
accordance with the laws of the state of 
Illinois.

    11.7 Successors. All obligations of the Company under the Plan shall be 
binding on any successor to the Company, whether the existence of such 
successor is the result of a direct or indirect purchase, merger, 
consolidation, or otherwise, of all or substantially all of the business and/or 
assets of the Company.

Article 3. Administration

Committee. Subject to the provisions herein, the Committee shall have full 
power to select employees for participation in the Plan; to determine the 
terms and conditions of each employee's participation in the Plan; to 
construe and interpret the Plan and any agreement or instrument entered 
into under the Plan; to establish, amend, or waive rules and regulations for 
the Plan's administration; to amend (subject to the provisions of Article 8 
herein) the terms and conditions of the Plan and any agreement entered 
into under the Plan; and to make any other determinations which may be 
necessary or advisable for the administration of the Plan.

    The Committee may delegate any of the following of its authorities 
granted under the Plan to any officer or employee of the Company:

    (a)  The authority to construe and interpret the Plan and any agreement 
or instrument entered into under the Plan;

    (b)  The authority to establish, amend, or waive rules and regulations for

    3.2  Decisions Binding. All determinations and decisions made by the

all related orders or resolutions of the Committee and/or its designate shall 
be final, conclusive, and binding on all persons, including the Company, its 
stockholders, employees, Participants, and their estates and beneficiaries.

Article 4. Eligibility and Participation
    Persons eligible to participate in the Plan include key employees of the 
Company, as selected by the Committee, at its sole discretion. It is the 
intent of the Company to extend eligibility only to those employees who 
comprise a select group of management or highly compensated employees.

    In the event a Participant no longer meets the requirements for 
participation in the Plan, such Participant shall become an inactive 
Participant, retaining all the rights described under the Plan, except the 
right to receive further Company contributions under Article 5 herein, 
until such time that the Participant again becomes an active Participant.

Article 5. Profit Sharing Plan Restoration
    5.1  Company Contributions. For each Year in which an employee is a 
Participant, the Company will credit to each Participant's account in the 
Plan an amount equal to (a) minus (b) where:

    (a)  Is the amount which would have been credited to the Participant's 
retirement and optional accounts under the Profit Sharing Plan from 
employer contributions and forfeitures for such Year had the amounts not 
been limited by Sections 415 and 401(a)(17) of the Code; and

    (b)  Is the amount which actually is credited to the Participant's 
retirement and optional accounts under the Profit Sharing Plan.

    5.2  Vesting of Company Contributions. Each Participant shall vest in his 
or her Company contributions described under Section 5.1 herein 
according to the following schedule:


Number of Years of                        Cumulative
Employment Under                        Percentage of Vested
the Profit Sharing Plan                  Company Contributions

Less than 1 year                                     0%
1 year but less than 2 years                        20%
2 years but less than 3 years                       40%
3 years but less than 4 years                       60%
4 years but less than 5 years                       80%
5 years or over                                    100%

    5.3  Earnings on Company Contributions. Company contributions under 
this Article 5 will be credited with the same rate(s) of earnings as is/are 
Company contributions under the Profit Sharing Plan. 

    The Company shall not be required to direct that Company 
contributions with respect to each Participant under this Plan actually be 
invested in the same funds as Company contributions under the Profit 
Sharing Plan. Rather, such accruals shall be maintained as bookkeeping 
accounts, as if the investments corresponding to those made by each 
Participant under the Profit Sharing Plan were actually made under this 
Plan, at the same time, and in the same proportionate amounts as elected 
under the Profit Sharing Plan.

    The administration of such accruals under this Plan shall be the 
responsibility of the Committee or its designate, and shall be conducted 
according to such rules, procedures, and determinations as the Committee 
(or the Committee's designate), at its sole discretion, deems appropriate. 
Participants and their beneficiaries shall have no right to direct the actual 
investment of any funds subject to this Plan.

    5.4  Form and Timing of Benefit Payments. Benefit payments under this 
Article 5 shall be payable in the same form, and at the same time, as the 
corresponding tax-qualified contributions payable to the Participant under 
the Profit Sharing Plan; provided, however, that the Committee shall have 
the authority, at its sole discretion, to accelerate the payout of such benefit 
payments upon: (i) the termination of a Participant's employment; or (ii) 
upon a Change in Control. 

    5.5  Beneficiary. Each Participant shall be entitled to designate one (1) 
or more beneficiaries of the Participant under this Plan. Such beneficiary may 
or may not be the same as those named by the Participant under the Profit 
Sharing Plan. All designations shall be signed by the Participant, and shall 
be in such form as prescribed by the Committee or its designate. Each 
designation shall be effective as of the date received by the Company. 

    Participants may change their designations of beneficiary on such form 
as prescribed by the Committee or its designate. The payment of account 
balances under the Plan shall be in accordance with the last unrevoked 
written designation of beneficiary that has been signed by the Participant 
and delivered by the Participant to the Company prior to the Participant's 
death.

    In the event that all the beneficiaries named by a Participant pursuant to 
this Section 5.5 predecease the Participant, the amounts that would have 
been paid to the Participant or the Participant's beneficiaries under this Plan 
shall be paid to the Participant's estate.

    In the event a Participant does not designate a beneficiary, or for any 
reason such designation is ineffective, in whole or in part, the amounts that 
otherwise would have been paid to the Participant or the Participant's 
beneficiaries under the Plan shall be paid to the Participant's estate.

    5.6  Contribution Accounts. The Company shall establish and maintain 
separate individual bookkeeping accounts for Company contributions and 
earnings accruals corresponding to such Company contributions made on 
behalf of Participants pursuant to Section 5.1 herein. Such accounts shall 
be administered according to such rules and procedures as the Committee 
(or its designate), at is sole discretion, deems appropriate. 

Article 6. Rights of Participants
    6.1  Contractual Obligation. The Plan shall create a contractual obligation 
on the part of the Company to make payments from the Participants' 
accounts when due. Payment of account balances shall be made out of the 
general funds of the Company.

    6.2  Unsecured Interest. No Participant or party claiming an interest in 
Company contributions under a Participant shall have any interest 
whatsoever in any specific asset of the Company. To the extent that any 
party acquires a right to receive payments under the Plan, such right shall 
be equivalent to that of an unsecured general creditor of the Company.

    The Company may establish one or more trusts, with such trustee as the 
Committee or its designate may approve, for the purpose of providing for 
the payment of Company contributions. Such trust or trusts may be 
irrevocable, but the assets thereof shall be subject to the claims of the 
Company's general creditors. To the extent any Company contributions 
under the Plan are actually paid from any such trust, the Company shall 
have no further obligation with respect thereto, but to the extent not so 
paid, such Company contributions shall remain the obligation of, and shall 
be paid by, the Company.

    6.3  Employment. Nothing in the Plan shall interfere with nor limit in any 
way the right of the Company to terminate any Participant's employment at 
any time, nor confer upon any Participant any right to continue in the 
employ of the Company.

    6.4  Participation. No employee shall have the right to be selected as a 
Participant, or, having been so selected for any given Year, to be selected 
again for any other Year.

Article 7. Withholding of Taxes
    The Company shall have the right to require Participants to remit to the 
Company an amount sufficient to satisfy Federal, state, and local 
withholding tax requirements, or to deduct from all payments made 
pursuant to the Plan amounts sufficient to satisfy withholding tax 
requirements.

Article 8. Amendment and Termination
    The Company hereby reserves the right to amend, modify, or terminate 
the Plan at any time by action of the Committee. Except as described 
below in this Article 8, no such amendment or termination shall in any 
material manner adversely affect any Participant's rights to Company 
contributions or earnings thereon, without the consent of the Participant.

    The Plan is intended to be an unfunded plan maintained primarily to 
provide deferred compensation benefits for a select group of "management 
or highly compensated employees" within the meaning of Sections 201, 
301, and 401 of ERISA, and therefore to be exempt from the provisions of 
Parts 2, 3, and 4 of Title I of ERISA. Accordingly, the Committee may 
terminate the Plan and commence termination payout for all or certain 
Participants, or remove certain employees as Participants, if it is determined 
by the United States Department of Labor or a court of competent 
jurisdiction that the Plan constitutes an employee pension benefit plan 
within the meaning of Section 3(2) of ERISA which is not so exempt. If 
payout is commenced pursuant to the operation of this Article 8, the 
payment of such amounts shall be made in the manner, and at the times 
selected by the Committee; provided, however, that such payment shall 
not be extended for a longer period of time than would have been the case 
had the account balance payouts occurred as scheduled immediately prior 
to such accelerated payout.

Article 9. Miscellaneous
    9.1  Notice. Any notice or filing required or permitted to be given to the 
Company under the Plan shall be sufficient if in writing and hand 
delivered, or sent by registered or certified mail to the Corporate Secretary 
of the Company. Notice to the Corporate Secretary of the Company, if 
mailed, shall be addressed to the principal executive offices of the 
Company. Notice mailed to a Participant shall be at such address as is 
given in the records of the Company. Notices shall be deemed given as of 
the date of delivery or, if delivery is made by mail, as of the date shown on 
the postmark on the receipt for registration or certification.

    9.2  Nontransferability. Except as provided in Section 5.5 herein, 
Participants' rights to Company contributions and earnings thereon under 
the Plan may not be sold, transferred, assigned, or otherwise alienated or 
hypothecated, other than by will or by the laws of descent and distribution. 
In no event shall the Company make any payment under the Plan to any 
assignee or creditor of a Participant.

    9.3  Severability. In the event any provision of the Plan shall be held 
illegal or invalid for any reason, the illegality or invalidity shall not 
affect the remaining parts of the Plan, and the Plan shall be construed and 
enforced as if the illegal or invalid provision had not been included.

    9.4  Gender and Number. Except where otherwise indicated by the 
context, any masculine term used herein also shall include the feminine; 
the plural shall include the singular, and the singular shall include the 
plural.

    9.5  Costs of the Plan. All costs of implementing and administering the 
Plan shall be borne by the Company.

    9.6  Applicable Law. The Plan shall be governed by and construed in 
accordance with the laws of the state of Illinois.

    9.7  Successors. All obligations of the Company under the Plan shall be 
binding on any successor to the Company, whether the existence 
of such successor is the result of a direct or indirect purchase, merger, 
consolidation, or otherwise, of all or substantially all of the business and/or 
assets of the Company.
