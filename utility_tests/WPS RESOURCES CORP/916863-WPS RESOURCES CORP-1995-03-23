                                   PART I

ITEM 1.  BUSINESS

                                  A. GENERAL

   WPS Resources Corporation ("Company"), a Wisconsin corporation,
was incorporated on December 3, 1993 as a subsidiary of Wisconsin
Public Service Corporation ("WPSC").  On September 1, 1994, the
Company, in a share-for-share exchange of common stock, acquired all
of the common stock of WPSC, $4 par value, and issued to the former
shareholders of WPSC shares of the Company's common stock, $1 par
value.  The Company operates as a holding company with both utility
and non-regulated business units.  It is the parent company of WPSC, a
regulated electric and gas utility, and its non-regulated subsidiary
WPS Leasing, Inc.  Immediately after the reorganization there were two
non-regulated subsidiaries of the Company, WPS Communications Inc.
("Communications") and Packerland Energy Services, Inc.("Packerland"). 
WPS Energy Services, Inc. ("WPSE"), a new subsidiary, was formed on
October 12, 1994 for the purpose of marketing energy and related
services.  On January 3, 1995, Packerland was merged into WPSE in an
effort to consolidate the marketing of energy and related services. 
At December 31, 1994, WPSC represented 99% of the Company's
consolidated assets, revenues and net income.


B.  ELECTRIC OPERATIONS

   GENERAL MATTERS.  The largest communities served at retail with
electricity are the cities of Green Bay, Oshkosh, Wausau and Stevens
Point.

    WPSC's maximum net demand in 1994 was 1,549,000 kw which
occurred on June 16.  At that time, system capability was
1,819,900 kw, and after adjustments for firm purchases and sales to
other utilities, WPSC's reserve capacity was 16.6%.  This 1994 maximum
net demand was slightly lower than the 1993 summer net peak demand. 
WPSC's future reserves, also adjusted for firm purchases and sales and
planned capacity additions, are estimated to be above the planning
criteria of a 15% minimum reserve in 1995 and 1996.  See Part I,
Item 2, PROPERTIES, at page 24 for information concerning generating
facilities.

   Coordinated planning for generation and transmission is a
function of the Wisconsin Upper Michigan Systems of which WPSC is a
member along with Wisconsin Power and Light Company ("WP&L"), Madison
Gas & Electric Company ("MG&E"), Wisconsin Electric Power Company
("WEPCO"), Upper Peninsula Power Company and Wisconsin Public Power,
Inc. ("WPPI").  Existing and planned interconnections with other
neighboring utilities provide a further means of sharing reserve
capacities and interchanging energy. 
   
    WPSC owns 33.1% of the outstanding capital stock of Wisconsin
River Power Company ("River Power").  The business of River Power

                                    -1-
<PAGE>
consists of the ownership and operation of two dams and related
hydroelectric plants on the Wisconsin River having an aggregate
installed capacity of about 35,000 kw.  The output of the
hydroelectric plants is sold, at the sites of the plants, to the three
companies which own the outstanding capital stock substantially in
proportion to their stock ownership interests.

   KEWAUNEE NUCLEAR POWER PLANT.  WPSC is the operator and 41.2%
owner of Kewaunee which is owned jointly with WP&L and MG&E.  This
plant began commercial operation in 1974.  The Kewaunee capability
factor was 86.6% in 1994, compared to a projected industry average of
73.7%.

   WPSC is a member of the Institute of Nuclear Power Operations
("INPO"), an organization of nuclear utilities which promotes
excellence in all aspects of nuclear plant operations.  INPO manages
the accreditation process for industry training programs, which
includes periodic accreditation of those training programs by an
independent organization, the National Nuclear Accrediting Board
("NNAB").  All ten accredited training programs at Kewaunee are
currently in good standing with the NNAB.  
   
   The steam generator tubes at Kewaunee are susceptible to
corrosion characteristics seen throughout the nuclear industry. 
Inspections are performed to identify degraded tubes.  Degraded tubes
are either repaired by sleeving or are removed from service by
plugging.  The steam generators were designed with approximately 15%
heat transfer margin, meaning that full power should be sustainable
with the equivalent of 15% of the steam generator tubes plugged.  Tube
plugging and the build-up of deposits on the tubes affect the heat-
transfer capability of the steam generators to the point where
eventually full power operation is affected.  The result will be a
gradual decrease in the capacity of the plant.  The plant's capacity
could be reduced by as much as 20% by the year 2013 when the current
operating license expires.  Currently, the equivalent of approximately
12% of the tubes in the steam generators are plugged with no loss of
capacity.  WPSC recently completed studies evaluating the economics of
replacing the two steam generators at Kewaunee.  The studies resulted
in the conclusion that the most prudent course of action is to
continue operation of the existing steam generators.  WPSC continues
to evaluate appropriate repair strategies, including replacement, as
well as continued operation of the steam generators without
replacement.  WPSC also continues to fund the development of welded
repair technology for steam generator tubes. 
   
   WPSC continues to evaluate and implement initiatives to improve
the performance of Kewaunee which already performs at above average
levels for the industry.  These initiatives include conversion from a
twelve-month to an eighteen-month operating cycle beginning in the
spring of 1995 and numerous other cost reduction measures.  These
initiatives have resulted in approximately a 25% reduction in Kewaunee
operating and maintenance costs since 1991.

   Physical decommissioning of Kewaunee is expected to occur during
the period 2014 to 2021 with additional expenditures being incurred
during the period 2022 to 2050 related to the storage of spent nuclear
fuel at the site.  In July of 1994, the Public Service Commission of
Wisconsin ("PSCW") issued an order covering all Wisconsin utilities
that have nuclear generation.  The order standardizes cost escalation
assumptions used in determining decommissioning liabilities.  Based
upon this new methodology, and considering other assumption changes,
Kewaunee decommissioning costs are estimated to be $357 million in
current dollars and $785 million in year of expenditure dollars.
WPSC's share of Kewaunee decommissioning costs are estimated to be
$147 million in current dollars.  These costs are recovered currently
in customer rates and deposited in external trusts.  As a result of
the new order, annual funding is expected to increase from
approximately $4.0 million to approximately $8.7 million.  On
December 31, 1994, the market value of the investments in the trusts
was $64.1 million.

   Spent fuel is currently stored at Kewaunee.  The existing
capacity of the spent fuel storage facility will enable storage of the
projected quantities of spent fuel through April 2001.   WPSC is
evaluating options for the storage of additional quantities beyond
2001.  Several technologies are available.  An investment of
approximately $2.5 million in the early 2000s could provide additional
storage sufficient to meet spent fuel storage needs until the
expiration of the current operating license in 2013.

   The Low-Level Radioactive Waste Policy Act of 1980 specifies that
states may enter into compacts to provide for regional low level waste
disposal facilities.  Wisconsin is a member of the Midwest Low Level
Radioactive Waste Compact. The state of Ohio has been selected as the
host state for the Midwest Compact and is proceeding with the
preliminary phases of site selection.  In June of 1994, the Barnwell,
South Carolina disposal facility, which had been accepting Kewaunee
low level radioactive waste materials, discontinued taking waste
materials from outside its region. WPSC expects to have sufficient
storage space of its own to satisfy low level radioactive waste
disposal needs until the Ohio facility accepts low level radioactive
waste materials.

   FUEL SUPPLY.  WPSC's electric generation mix in 1994 compared to
1993 was: steam plants (coal), 62.6%, down from 64.7%; steam plant
(nuclear), 14.5%, down from 14.6%; hydro, 2.6%, down from 3.2%;
combined natural gas and fuel oil, .7%, up from .4%; and purchased
power, 19.6%, up from 17.1%.  Purchased power represents short-term
energy purchases.

   WPSC has reduced over-all fuel costs for the fifth consecutive
year.  Fuel costs in 1994 compared with 1993, expressed in dollars per
million BTU, were: nuclear, $.49, up from $.45; coal, $1.31, down from
$1.38; natural gas, $2.77, down from $3.41; and No. 2 fuel oil, $4.15,
up from $3.96.   

                                    -3-
<PAGE>
    In 1995, WPSC will purchase almost all of the coal for its
solely-owned plants from Western sources.  Delivery of coal at the
Pulliam plant is via railroad or lake vessel and at the Weston,
Columbia and Edgewater plants via railroad.

    Pulliam and Weston Units 1 and 2 burn Powder River Basin sub-
bituminous coal. WPSC has a long-term contract with one coal supplier
that is expected to provide approximately two-thirds of the projected
1995 coal requirements for Unit 3 at Weston.  The coal contract will
provide low sulfur Powder River Basin coal for a term ending in 2016. 
The remainder of the coal for solely-owned generating facilities is
purchased under short-term agreements of two years or less.

   During 1991, WPSC bought-out the coal supply agreement with NERCO
Coal Company ("NERCO") and the corresponding rail transportation
contracts with the Soo Line and the Wisconsin Central ("Railroads"). 
WPSC paid approximately $34 million to NERCO and the Railroads as
compensation for relief of all contractual obligations.  The PSCW has
ruled that the railroad and coal contract buyout costs may be
recovered in customer rates subject to a benefits test.  Management
believes it will meet the benefits test and therefore recover in
future rates all of the buyout costs because the cost of replacement
coal plus the buyout costs as amortized and a return on the
unamortized portion of the buyout costs are less than the costs under
the original contracts.  In the Wisconsin jurisdiction, the remaining
unamortized buyout costs of $15.4 million will be recovered during
1995 and 1996.  The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission ("FERC")
issued an order on November 15, 1994 allowing recovery of all but
approximately $3.6 million of NERCO buyout costs through a monthly
surcharge rate over the period January 1993 through December 2005. 
The portion of the $3.6 million disallowance allocable to the FERC
jurisdiction will not be determined until the end of 1995.  Management
believes that it is likely that the disallowance allocable to the FERC
jurisdiction will not exceed the $625,000 write off taken in 1993 in
anticipation of the disallowance. WPSC will accrue and recover
carrying charges on the unrecovered balance.  

   WPSC also has a 31.8% ownership share in Columbia and a 31.8%
ownership share in the Edgewater Unit 4, both of which are operated by
WP&L which has coal procurement responsibilities for these units. 
Columbia, with two 527 megawatt units, uses coal from the Wyoming-
Montana coal fields.  One hundred percent of the low sulfur coal for
Unit 1 is supplied under terms of a contract which expires in 2004. 
The entire low sulfur coal supply for Unit 2 is supplied from the
Southern Powder River Basin under short-term contracts.  Edgewater
uses a blend of bituminous and sub-bituminous Powder River Basin coal
both of which are acquired under short-term contracts.    

    In 1989, the PSCW concluded that WP&L did not properly
administer a coal contract for Columbia, which is owned 31.8% by WPSC,
46.2% by WP&L and 22.0% by MG&E, and ordered WP&L to refund $9 million
to the customers of WPSC, WP&L and MG&E proportionately according to
the ownership shares of each utility in Columbia.  WP&L appealed the
PSCW decision, and that PSCW action was found to represent unlawful

                                    -4-
<PAGE>
retroactive ratemaking by both the Dane County Circuit Court and the
Wisconsin Court of Appeals.  On February 8, 1994, the Wisconsin
Supreme Court upheld the decision of the Wisconsin Court of Appeals.  

   The supply of nuclear fuel for Kewaunee requires the purchase of 
uranium concentrates, the conversion of uranium concentrates to
uranium hexafluoride, enrichment of the uranium hexafluoride and
fabrication of the enriched uranium into usable fuel assemblies. 
After a region (approximately one-third of the nuclear fuel assemblies
in the reactor) of spent fuel is removed from the reactor, it is
placed in temporary storage for cooling in a spent fuel pool at the
plant site.  Permanent storage is addressed below.  There are
presently no operating facilities in the United States reprocessing
commercial nuclear fuel.  A discussion of the nuclear fuel supply for
Kewaunee follows:

(a)     Requirements for uranium are met through spot or contract
        purchases.  An inventory policy, which takes advantage of
        economical spot market purchases of uranium, results in WPSC
        maintaining inventories sufficient for three reactor reloads of
        fuel.  

(b)     Uranium hexafluoride from inventory and from spot market
        purchases was used to satisfy converted material requirements in
        1994. WPSC intends to purchase future conversion services on the
        spot market.

(c)     In 1994, enriched uranium was procured from COGEMA, Inc. pursuant
        to a contract executed in 1983 and last amended in 1993. 
        Enrichment services were purchased from the  United States
        Enrichment Corporation ("Enrichment Corporation") under the terms
        of the utility services contract which is in effect for the life
        of Kewaunee.  WPSC is committed to take 70% of its annual
        enrichment requirements in 1995, and in alternate years
        thereafter, from the Enrichment Corporation.

(d)     Fuel fabrication requirements through June 15, 1995 are covered
        by contract.  WPSC is finalizing a contract for fuel fabrication
        extending through 2001.

(e)     Beyond the stated periods set forth above, additional contracts
        for uranium concentrates, conversion to uranium hexafluoride,
        fabrication and spent fuel storage will have to be procured. 
        WPSC anticipates the prices for the foregoing will increase.

   Pursuant to the Nuclear Waste Policy Act of 1982 ("Nuclear Policy
Act"), the U. S. Department of Energy ("DOE") has entered into a
contract with WPSC to accept, transport and dispose of spent nuclear
fuel beginning no later than January 31, 1998.  It is likely that the
DOE will delay the acceptance of spent nuclear fuel beyond 1998.  A
fee to offset the costs of the DOE's disposal for all spent fuel used
since April 7, 1983 has been assessed by DOE at one mill per net
kilowatt hour of electricity generated and sold by Kewaunee.  An

                                    -5-
<PAGE>
additional one-time fee was paid to DOE for the disposal of spent
nuclear fuel used to generate electricity prior to April 7, 1983.

   The Nuclear Policy Act provides that both the federal government
and the nuclear utilities fund the decontamination and decommissioning
of the three gaseous diffusion plants in the United States.  Utility
contributions will be collected through a special assessment based on
a utility's percentage of uranium enrichment services purchased
through the date of enactment compared to total enrichment sales by
the DOE.  The owners of Kewaunee are required to pay approximately
$19.2 million in current dollars over a period of fifteen years. At
December 31, 1994, the remaining liability was $15.4 million of which
WPSC's share is $6.3 million.  The payments are subject to adjustment
for inflation.

   RHINELANDER ENERGY CENTER. WPSC has identified the need for
additional power supply late in this decade.  To satisfy this need,
WPSC has signed a thirty-five year steam and electrical sales
agreement with Rhinelander Paper Company, Inc. ("Rhinelander Paper")
which likely will be amended to reflect continuing negotiations
between the parties.  This agreement provides for WPSC to construct,
own and operate the Rhinelander Energy Center ("REC"), a 122 megawatt
cogeneration facility, with an estimated cost of $169 million,
adjacent to Rhinelander Paper's mill in Rhinelander, Wisconsin. 
Rhinelander Paper will purchase and use steam from the facility in its
paper processes. On September 24, 1993, WPSC initiated the filing
process for a Certificate of Public Convenience and Necessity ("CPCN")
which must be issued by the PSCW to permit construction of the REC. 
Action by the PSCW on the application is being carried out under a
recently developed two-stage CPCN process regulated by the PSCW.  In
the first stage, WPSC requested proposals from electric generating
plant project developers and compared them to the proposed REC.  On
December 21, 1994, the PSCW issued its order approving WPSC's REC
project as the least cost solution to WPSC's capacity needs.  One
unsuccessful bidder, Polsky Energy Corporation ("Polsky") petitioned
for a rehearing of the PSCW's decision. The PSCW has agreed to
consider Polsky's allegations regarding the accuracy of certain
computations related to WPSC's successful bid.  On March 9, 1995, in
response to the Polsky petition, the PSCW affirmed their original
decision in holding that the REC remains the least cost alternative
which will satisfy WPSC's additional capacity needs.  WPSC is
proceeding with stage two of the CPCN process to obtain PSCW
authorization to construct the REC, a process which is expected to
result in a final decision on the CPCN in the second half of 1995 in
order to have the facility in service in the summer of 1998.   

   OTHER MATTERS.  On January 14, 1994, WPSC submitted its Advance
Plan 7 filing to the PSCW.  It was updated on April 29, 1994.  This
plan identifies both the demand side and supply side needs of WPSC
through the year 2013.  Preliminary plans indicate that demand side
management programs will reduce the need for additional electric
capacity by 269 megawatts.  Supply side generation forecasts indicate
the need for peaking generating units in 2001, 2002, 2004 and 2005
(combustion turbines of 75 megawatts each), an intermediate generating

                                    -6-
<PAGE>
unit in 2009 (215 megawatt combined-cycle gas-fired unit), and a
peaking generating unit in 2013 (75 megawatt combustion turbine).  The
plan also includes 122 megawatts of cogeneration from the REC as
discussed above.  Other smaller scale renewable projects are included
in the plan.  Pulliam Units 3 and 4 are included in the plan as being
retired in 1998.  They began operating in the 1940's.  Advance Plan 7
must go through the regulatory review process. Hearings started in
November of 1994 and are scheduled to conclude in May of 1995.
   
    WPSC is developing and implementing strategies to deal with
issues raised by the National Energy Policy Act of 1992 ("Policy
Act").  The Policy Act's provisions for transmission access should
have minimal impact on WPSC because WPSC already has transportation
tariffs on file at the FERC.  The generation provisions of the Policy
Act could create additional competition in that market; however,
generation opportunities for WPSC also could increase.

   Regionally, the member companies of the Mid-America
Interconnected Network, of which WPSC is a member, are planning the
formation of a regional transmission group ("RTG") that will open up
the entire transmission grid within the network to member companies
and others who choose to participate.  It will then be easier than
ever to transport electric power from one purchaser to another.  FERC
must approve the agreement for the formation of a RTG.

    WPSC faces increased competition in the wholesale power market. 
This may result in the loss of certain wholesale customers and reduced
margins.  WPSC intends to compete aggressively to retain wholesale
load.

   In October of 1992, WPPI notified WPSC that it was ending its
agreement to purchase power effective in October of 1997.  WPPI is a
wholesale customer which buys 66 megawatts from WPSC for resale to
municipal utilities in Algoma, Eagle River, New Holstein, Sturgeon Bay
and Two Rivers.  WPPI has entered into an agreement to buy power from
another Wisconsin utility during the period 1997 to 2009.  Also, WPSC
has negotiated a new power supply agreement with the City of Wisconsin
Rapids. 

   Although 12% of electric revenues come from sales to twenty paper
mills, resulting in a relatively high and favorable load factor, there
is no single customer or small group of customers, the loss of which
would have a materially adverse effect on the electric business of
WPSC.    

   In August of 1994, WPSC received approval from the PSCW to
construct a portion of a jointly owned 138 Kv transmission line
extending from New London to Stevens Point. WPSC's share of the sixty
mile transmission project will cost approximately $14.9 million; the
remaining $9.6 million cost of the project is the responsibility of
WEPCO and WP&L.  Completion of the project is expected by early 1997. 
In the same order, the PSCW denied an application by WPPI to build and
own the project facilities as a means to reduce its overall power
supply costs.  WPSC, WEPCO and WP&L offered, and were ultimately

                                    -7-
<PAGE>
ordered, to file Network Transmission Service ("NTS") tariffs with the
FERC that would offer comparable use on their transmission systems.
WPSC tendered its NTS tariff for filing with the FERC in September of
1994.  Currently, the NTS tariff is under review by the FERC and
intervenors.

   WPSC also is waiting for a ruling from the PSCW regarding the
Wausau to Abbotsford transmission project, which is part of a larger
transmission interface project with Northern States Power Company,
consisting of the rebuild of approximately twenty-three miles of
115 Kv transmission line.  The cost of the project is estimated to be
$4.2 million. 

   Applications for relicensing of WPSC's Caldron Falls, High Falls,
Johnson Falls, Sandstone Rapids, Potato Rapids, Peshtigo, Grand Rapids
and Jersey Projects were submitted to the FERC in December of 1991. 
These licenses, representing 30 megawatts of hydroelectric generating
capacity, expired in December of 1993.  Since the FERC had not
considered WPSC's applications at the license expiration dates, the
licenses have been extended on an annual basis until FERC acts on the
applications.  Application to the FERC for relicensing of WPSC's
Wausau Project was submitted in June of 1993.  The license for this
project expires in June of 1995 and represents 5,400 kilowatts of
capacity.

   In the fall of 1994, the PSCW initiated a proceeding to assess
the future of utility regulation in Wisconsin and to investigate the
structure necessary for utilities to compete in the new electric
marketplace.  Public meetings have been held to identify the relevant
issues.  This matter is discussed in more detail in Part I, Item 1E,
REGULATORY MATTERS, at page 21.   

   Electric research and development expenditures totaled
$2.3 million for 1994, $2.1 million for 1993 and $2.0 million for
1992.  These expenditures were made for WPSC sponsored projects and
were primarily charged to electric operations.

                              C.  GAS OPERATIONS

   GENERAL MATTERS.  At December 31, 1994, WPSC provided natural gas
distribution service to 191,551 customers in 138 cities, villages and
towns in Northeastern Wisconsin and 4,998 customers in and around
Menominee, Michigan.  The principal Wisconsin cities served include
Green Bay, Oshkosh, Sheboygan, Marinette, Two Rivers, Stevens Point
and Rhinelander.  

   WPSC transported 58,508,511 dekatherms of gas of which
34,757,372 dekatherms were for resale during the year ended
December 31, 1994.  At the end of 1994, WPSC had 117 end-user
customers who purchased their gas directly from suppliers and
contracted with transporters, including WPSC, to transport the gas to
their points of use.  A total of 23,751,139 dekatherms was transported
for these customers.  During 1994, several transportation customers
returned to purchasing their gas requirements from WPSC.  Load loss
due to fuel switching has been minor because customers have been able
to purchase transportation gas from suppliers at competitive prices.

   Since WPSC has a purchased gas adjustment provision as part of
its customer rates, it recovers all of its purchased gas costs from
customers.  This allows WPSC to receive the same margin (gas revenues
less cost of gas) on therm sales to customers who purchase natural gas
from WPSC as it receives from transportation customers.   

   WPSC retains a gas supply consultant who assists in creating a
gas supply portfolio to match its gas load profile at the lowest
reasonable cost.  The portfolio is based on twenty-year gas peak day
and annual sales forecasts and is structured to place WPSC in an
optimum gas purchasing position.  WPSC has entered into seventeen gas
supply contracts with fourteen suppliers with terms from five months
to six years with domestic suppliers and ten years with Canadian
suppliers.  There are nine years remaining on the contracts with
Canadian suppliers.  The large majority of gas is competitively priced
based on a monthly spot price index.  The gas supply contracts contain
a gas inventory charge as well as corporate warranties to assure gas
deliverability for the term of the contract.

   Peak day design requirements of 340,777 dekatherms per day is
based on a 1994-1995 peak day forecast at -20 degrees Fahrenheit.  An
additional 11,295 dekatherms per day, or 3.3%, of reserve capacity
allows for growth and any unforeseen needs.  Peak day requirements
will be served by 117,657 dekatherms per day from transportation gas,
and 223,120 dekatherms per day from storage gas. WPSC has access to
eleven BCF of storage capacity in Michigan.  Storage gas is purchased
and stored during the summer for redelivery during the heating season. 
WPSC has purchased 0.1 BCF of underground salt dome storage in
Louisiana to protect against a supply area gas shortage.

    WPSC transports gas from Louisiana, the Gulf of Mexico, the
Texas-Oklahoma Panhandle area and Canada under contracts with ANR
Pipeline Company ("ANR") for domestic gas and Viking Gas Transmission
Company ("Viking") for Canadian supplies.  On November 1, 1993, FERC

                                    -11-
<PAGE>
Order 636 became effective for ANR.  Order 636 prohibits pipeline
companies, such as ANR, from bundling gas merchant services with
transportation services.  Thus, Order 636 shifts gas supply
responsibilities to local distribution companies, such as WPSC, while
the pipeline companies continue to transport gas owned by others. 
Pipeline transportation rates are governed by tariffs which are
subject to adjustment by the pipeline companies with the approval of
the FERC.  As a result of restructuring under Order 636, effective
November 1, 1993, WPSC contracted for its pro rata share of pipeline
capacity from each of ANR's three supply areas:  Southeast, Southwest,
and Canada.  The initial term of each contract was for ten years with
the right to extend in five-year increments.  In addition, WPSC has
preexisting capacity on Viking for delivery of Canadian gas with a
term of four years with a right to extend.

   Order 636 mandates a straight fixed variable rate design which
loads all fixed costs into the reservation charge.  Based on rates
effective May 1, 1994, pipeline company reservation charges for 1995
will total approximately $41.3 million. WPSC also has a no-notice
service to accommodate load swings caused by unexpected system
requirements.     
   
   On December 30, 1994, in FERC Docket No. TM 95-3-48-000, ANR
filed its sixth annual reconciliation of the take-or-pay
buyout/buydown costs recovered through monthly charges.  These costs,
which represent 75% of ANR's total take-or-pay buyout/buydown costs
paid to their gas suppliers, are being passed on to ANR's customers,
including WPSC.  WPSC's remaining fixed charge obligation for the two
take-or-pay dockets still outstanding is $41,930.  Monthly fixed
charge payments and volumetric payments are scheduled to be made
through April 1998.  All such costs are expected to be recovered from
customers pursuant to established policies of the PSCW.

   ANR, as a result of its FERC Order 636 compliance filing, will
recover various transition costs from its customers, including WPSC. 
WPSC expects to recover ANR transition costs in future customer rates. 
These costs include purchased gas adjustment costs of which WPSC's
share is approximately $3.7 million.  In addition, ANR has upstream
pipeline capacity costs of between $85 million and $275 million of
which WPSC's share is approximately 10%.  The exact amount cannot be
determined at this time. 

   WPSC is currently being billed for ANR's above-market costs of
gas purchases from the Dakota Gasification Plant.  The potential total
amount of these billings is undetermined at this time.  The 1994
allocation of these costs was $3.2 million, and the 1995 allocation is
expected to be $3.3 million. WPSC, as part of the Wisconsin
Distributors Group ("WDG"), is contesting the legality of the Dakota
Gasification Plant costs provision and is paying these costs under
protest subject to refund.  A hearing before the District of Columbia
Circuit Court could take place in 1995.

                                    -12-
<PAGE>
   WPSC is a member of the WDG which utilizes a Washington, D.C.
legal counsel to monitor FERC activities and advise the group.  The
group files testimony and interventions in cases that impact its
members.  WPSC is also advised by the same Washington, D.C. legal
counsel.  WPSC files interventions in cases to protect its interests
as they may be different from the group.

   All of WPSC's Wisconsin retail natural gas rates contain a
purchased gas adjustment clause which provides for tracking changes
for wholesale costs and an annual true-up of such costs.  The PSCW
reaffirmed this purchased gas adjustment clause/true-up mechanism in
WPSC's 1994 rate order. WPSC's Michigan retail rates include a gas
cost recovery plan under procedures authorized by the Michigan Public
Service Commission ("MPSC") in 1983.  Both the PSCW and the MPSC have
approved mechanisms to allow for full recovery of take-or-pay and
transition related costs which the FERC has authorized ANR to pass on
to its customers.
   
   WPSC is aggressively seeking new natural gas customers resulting
in the addition of about 6,557 new customers in 1994.  Growth in
natural gas customers results from adding new customers in existing
service areas and from the acquisition of new natural gas distribution
franchises.  At December 31, 1994, five applications for new gas
distribution franchises were pending before the PSCW.

   WPSC uses gas for power generation in peaking turbines and for
ignition and flame stabilization at its Weston Unit 3 and Pulliam
generating plants.

   One large industrial customer is in a geographical location which
would allow for its direct connection to the ANR system.  A special
rate designed to keep this customer on WPSC's distribution system has
been approved by the PSCW. The customer has requested a bypass to
connect directly to the ANR system, but remains a WPSC transportation
customer.  There is no single customer or small group of customers,
the loss of which would have a materially adverse effect on the
natural gas business of WPSC.

                        D. NON-REGULATED BUSINESSES 

        WPSE is engaged in the marketing of energy and related services. 
Packerland, which had been formed to take advantage of the natural gas
marketing opportunities created by FERC Order 636 which became
effective in November of 1993, was merged into WPSE on January 3,
1995.

   Communications was formed in 1985 to be a partner in the NorLight
fiber optics telecommunications partnership.  In 1991, the assets of
NorLight were sold.  After certain administrative matters are settled,
which have insignificant financial impacts, it is anticipated that
Communications will be dissolved.

   In December 1994, the Company committed $4 million for a non-
controlling interest in a limited liability corporation that will own
and operate a waste-paper recycling facility.   

   Rapidly changing technologies have been associated recently with
the electric and gas utility industry.  That is why the Company
continues its support of UTECH, a venture capital partnership which
invests in new technologies that could be applied to utility
operations.  The Company has $2.5 million invested in UTECH.

   The Company intends additional participation in non-regulated
energy related markets and is taking steps to establish a power
development business unit.



                     E.  ENVIRONMENTAL MATTERS
                                      

   GENERAL MATTERS.  WPSC is subject to regulation with regard to
the impact of its operations on air and water quality and solid waste
disposal, and may be subject to regulation with regard to other
environmental considerations by various federal, state and local
authorities.  The application of federal and state restrictions to
protect the environment involves or may involve review, certification
or issuance of permits by various federal and state authorities,
including the U. S. Environmental Protection Agency ("EPA") and the
Wisconsin Department of Natural Resources ("DNR").  Such restrictions,
particularly in regard to emissions into the air and water and solid
waste disposal, may limit, prevent or substantially increase the cost
of the operation of WPSC's generating facilities and may require
substantial investments in new equipment at existing installations. 
They may also require substantial investments for proposed new
projects and may delay or prevent authorization and completion of the
projects.  WPSC cannot forecast other effects of all such regulation
upon its generating, transmission and other facilities, or its
operations, but believes that it is presently meeting existing
requirements.


                                    -16-
<PAGE>
   AIR QUALITY.  The plants which WPSC operates are in compliance
with all current sulfur dioxide and nitrogen oxide emission standards.

   The Federal Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990 ("Act") were enacted
in 1990.  The Act requires reductions in sulfur dioxide in 1995
(Phase I) to meet limitations based on an emission rate of 2.5 pounds
per million BTUs multiplied by a historical generation baseline for
Pulliam Unit 8 and Edgewater Unit 4 generating units.  The Act
requires further reductions beginning in the year 2000 (Phase II). 
These limits are set based on an emission rate of 1.2 pounds per
million BTUs multiplied by a historical generation baseline for all
generating units.  WPSC's generating facilities met the year 2000
standard in 1994.  WPSC has achieved compliance with Wisconsin and
federal sulfur dioxide emission limitations by switching to low sulfur
coal. 

   Because of the emission allowance system included in the Act,
operations during Phase I are expected to produce surplus allowances
which are expected to be available to aid in compliance with the
requirements of Phase II.  To the extent WPSC determines that it will
have allowances available beyond its own requirements in both Phase I
and Phase II, it will consider the sale of these excess allowances. 
The PSCW has ordered that profits from the sale of allowances must be
used to benefit utility customers.    

   The Act also requires the installation of low nitrogen oxide
burners on several units.  Low nitrogen oxide burners were installed
at Pulliam Unit 8 early in 1994.  Phase I of the Act allows units
smaller than 100 megawatts, such as Pulliam Unit 7, to be designated
Phase I units, thus building up sulfur dioxide credits.  Having made
this election, low nitrogen oxide burners were installed at Pulliam
Unit 7 in 1994.  Expenditure of $15 million to $25 million are
projected through 1999 to assure continued federal and Wisconsin
emission compliance under all normal operating conditions at Pulliam
and Weston.  Based on past experience, it is anticipated that
expenditures related to sulfur dioxide and nitrogen oxide emission
compliance will be recoverable in customer rates.

   Air toxic provisions in the Act will not be applied until the EPA
conducts a three-year study to determine if those standards need to be
applied to utilities.  
   
   WATER QUALITY.  WPSC is subject to regulation by the EPA and the
DNR with respect to thermal and other discharges from WPSC's power
plants into Lake Michigan and other waters of Wisconsin.  Permits were
reissued to WPSC for its Pulliam and Weston power plants.  Various
portions of those permits were challenged.  These challenges have not
been formally resolved, although many of the issues raised in the
challenges have been resolved through informal discussions with the
DNR, additional testing by WPSC and regulatory changes.  Under
Wisconsin law, the challenged portions of the permits are stayed, and
the administrative review process is completed.  It is not anticipated
that any of the outstanding issues will have a material cost
associated with them.

   GAS PLANT CLEANUP.  WPSC is currently investigating the need for
environmental cleanup of eight manufactured gas plant sites which it
previously operated.  WPSC engaged an environmental consultant to
develop cleanup cost estimates for the two sites at which Phase II
site investigations have been completed.  The cleanup cost estimates
for the Stevens Point and the Oshkosh sites are $1.7 million and
$2.6 million, respectively.  With respect to Stevens Point, the
estimate assumes excavation of contaminated soils, thermal treatment
of soils, disposal of treatment residuals, on-site groundwater
extraction and treatment and post-cleanup monitoring for twenty-five
years.  The cost estimate for the Oshkosh site assumes, in addition to
those items noted for Stevens Point, removal and disposal of
contaminated river sediments.  The consultant has yet to perform
detailed investigations of the remaining six sites, and comparable
information on these sites is not available.     

   WPSC used the estimates for these two sites as a basis for making
projections on cleanup costs at the other sites.  Six of the eight
sites are located adjacent to rivers.  Using the Oshkosh cleanup
estimate, which includes remediation of contaminated river sediments,
and assuming all six sites have sediment contamination, and using the
Stevens Point estimate for the two sites not adjacent to rivers, the
range of future investigation and cleanup costs for all eight sites is
estimated to be from $14.8 million to $29.3 million.  Remediation
expenditures would be made over the next thirty-four years.  WPSC has
recorded as a liability with an offsetting deferred charge, i.e., a
regulatory asset, of $26.9 million, which represents WPSC's current
estimate of cleanup costs for all eight sites.  Based on discussions
with regulators and a recent rate order in Wisconsin, management
believes that these costs, but not the carrying costs associated with
the deferred charges, will be recoverable in future customer rates. 

   As additional detailed investigations are completed, three having
been initiated in 1994, these estimates will be adjusted to reflect
specific site data.  These adjustments could be significant.  Other
factors that can affect these estimates are changes in remedial
technology and regulatory requirements.  The estimates presented above
do not take into consideration any recovery from insurance carriers or
other third parties which WPSC is pursuing.     

   See also Part I, Item 3, LEGAL PROCEEDINGS, at page 25, for
discussion of the Sheboygan Gas Plant and Oshkosh Gas Plant sites.

   OTHER SOLID WASTE DISPOSAL.  On December 1, 1986, WPSC received
notice from EPA-Region V that it was one of 832 potentially
responsible parties ("PRP") for the cleanup of the Maxey Flats Waste
Disposal Site.  Documents obtained to date indicate that WPSC
contributed 0.0162% of the waste disposed of at the site.  A remedial
investigation and feasibility study has been completed.  At this time,
the cost of the remedial action and EPA oversight is estimated to be
about $77.5 million.  The EPA has offered a buyout agreement to de
minimis PRPs.  Although a final agreement has not been executed,
WPSC's buyout cost will be about $28,000.  While liability for cleanup
under the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and


                                    -18-
<PAGE>
Liability Act ("Superfund") program is joint and several, the amounts
paid by the PRPs are usually related to their volumetric contribution
of waste to the site.  

   In November of 1986, WPSC was notified by the DNR that it was one
of the several PRPs involved in the Holtz & Krause Landfill located in
Wausau, Wisconsin.  WPSC disposed of 12,516 cubic yards of non-
hazardous office waste and construction debris at the site.  This
represents 1.02% of the total amount of waste at the site.  The
landfill is currently being addressed only by the DNR.  The current
work is not being conducted as part of the EPA's Superfund program. 
The DNR has selected a remedy which is estimated to cost a total of
$11 million to $12 million.  The DNR has agreed to contribute
approximately $4.5 million toward the remedy.  Also, the county in
which the landfill is located has adopted a surcharge on the waste
disposal fee charged at the county's landfill to raise funds to assist
in the remediation.  Clean Sites, Inc., a neutral cost allocation
expert, was retained by the Holtz & Krause PRP Group to develop an
allocation.  The amount to be allocated to WPSC, $37,163, was paid to
the cleanup fund in October of 1993.  The DNR has indicated that it
will pursue a cost-recovery action against entities that do not settle
with the Holtz & Krause PRP Group.  In 1994, WPSC entered into a
Consent Decree that acknowledges the payment of the settlement amount,
requires the settling parties to clean up the site and requires the
state to pay its agreed upon contribution.  In addition, WPSC entered
into a "buyout" agreement with the larger contributors of waste to the
site in which the larger contributors agreed to indemnify WPSC for any
cost overruns up to a total site remedial cost of $20 million.  If
site remedial costs exceed $20 million, the cost allocation may be
reopened.  Most of the site work was completed in 1994.   

   In March of 1987, WPSC was notified by the EPA that it was a PRP
for the cost of cleaning up the Rose Chemical site in Holden,
Missouri.  Based on records that are available, a small amount of
polychlorinated biphenyl material, about 39,000 pounds, was sent to
the site.  At this time, WPSC has signed a participation agreement for
the cleanup and contributed $60,192 which is based on the volumetric
contribution of waste and the expected total cleanup cost.
   
   In November of 1988, WPSC received notice from the DNR that the
Sherman Street property located in Wausau, Wisconsin, had levels of
lead contamination present.  Based on an investigation conducted by a
neighboring business, Wausau Steel, it appears that this contamination
originates on an adjacent Wausau Steel property.  The cleanup of the
property by Wausau Steel has been completed, pending DNR approval.

   In January 1995, WPSC was notified that the EPA was seeking to
recover $775,442 from several companies, not including WPSC, that sent
waste drums to the J. K. Drum site in New London, Wisconsin.  One of
the companies notified by EPA requested WPSC to join a group to
negotiate a settlement with the EPA.  WPSC's records indicate that it
contributed drums to the site which it believes were empty.  WPSC is
evaluating a response to the notice.

                            F.  REGULATORY MATTERS

   GENERAL MATTERS.  Utility rates, service and securities issues of
WPSC are subject to regulation by the PSCW and the MPSC, and WPSC is
subject to regulation of its wholesale electric rates, hydroelectric
projects and certain other matters by the FERC.  It is also subject to
limited regulation by local authorities.  WPSC follows Statement of
Financial Accounting Standard No. 71, Accounting for the Effects of
Certain Types of Regulation, and its financial statements reflect the
effects of the different ratemaking principles of the various
jurisdictions.  These include the PSCW, 89% of revenues, the MPSC, 2%
of revenues and FERC, 9% of revenues.  The operation of Kewaunee is
subject to the jurisdiction of the U. S. Nuclear Regulatory
Commission.

   In the Wisconsin jurisdiction, the rate process has been changed
effective in 1995 such that retail electric and natural gas rates will
be set every two years, rather than annually as has been the practice
in the past.  The earliest that the rates which took effect January 1,
1995 could change would be for the year 1997.  Customer rates are set
based on forecasted expenses and capital costs. 

   Wisconsin retail rates include an electric fuel-adjustment clause
based on a "cost variance range approach."  This range is based on a
specific estimated fuel cost for the next year.  If actual fuel costs
fall outside this range, a hearing may be held and an adjustment to
future rates may result.  Automatic fuel-adjustment clauses are used
for FERC wholesale-electric and Michigan retail-electric portions of
WPSC's business.  WPSC has a purchased gas adjustment clause which
allows it to pass on to all classes of gas customers changes in the
cost of gas purchased from its suppliers, subject to PSCW and MPSC
review. 

   CUSTOMER RATE MATTERS.  In the Wisconsin jurisdiction, a
$17.4 million, or 4% electric rate reduction, and a $1 million, or
.6% natural gas rate increase, covering a one-year period, became
effective on January 1, 1994.  Electric revenues were also reduced
$2 million, or .5% in May of 1994 as a result of reduced fuel costs. 
Customer rates for 1994 reflected an authorized rate of return of
11.3% on common equity, down from 12.3% in 1993.  The return on common
equity, when adjusted to reflect allowed earnings on deferred
investment tax credits, amounted to 11.9% and 13.0%, respectively, for
the years 1994 and 1993.
   
   On December 19, 1994, the PSCW approved an electric rate
reduction of $10.9 million, or 2.6% to be effective on January 1, 1995
for the years 1995 and 1996.  Natural gas rates remained unchanged. 
The rates for 1995 and 1996 reflect an authorized rate of return on
common equity of 11.5% which when adjusted to reflect allowed earnings
on deferred investment tax credits is 12.18%.  A capital structure
including 54% common equity was also approved.  


                                    -20-
<PAGE>
   No changes were made to Michigan electric and gas rates during
1994 other than through the fuel adjustment clauses. Likewise,
wholesale electric rates remained unchanged except for reductions
related to fuel costs. 

   PSCW INDUSTRY RESTRUCTURING PROCEEDING.  On September 8, 1994,
the PSCW commenced a proceeding to consider the probable costs and
benefits of changing the structure and regulation of the electric
utility industry in Wisconsin.  Changes in federal law, improvements
in the electric transmission system and technological advances suggest
that now is the time to prepare for, capture and maximize the benefits
of a changing and more market-oriented industry.  

   At its January 24, 1995 meeting, the PSCW identified the primary
objectives of the proceeding to be the creation of a system that sends
accurate price signals to customers resulting in the most economically
efficient use of resources; the creation of a system which maximizes,
within the public interest, the number and diversity of service
offerings to customers; and the creation of a system in which
providers maximize economic efficiency and environmental stewardship. 

   The PSCW has created an Advisory Committee ("Committee"),
consisting of twenty-two members, representing various constituencies,
including a WPSC member, which will examine every aspect of electric
service and determine which functions, if any, should be performed by
a competitive market and identify specific transitional mechanisms
that may be needed to create a workable competitive market for these
services.  For services that have natural monopoly characteristics,
the Committee will explore whether new institutional or regulatory
policies could further benefit the public.  

   Following a period that includes public comment on the
Committee's recommendations, the Committee will submit its recommended
alternatives to the PSCW which will review the recommendations along
with outside comments before deciding the appropriate public policy
and commencing with implementation of its decision.  The work of the
Committee is intended to be finished in time to allow the PSCW to
prepare a final report for the legislature on recommendations for
legislative changes by December 1, 1995.

   ACCOUNTING DEVELOPMENTS.  See Part II, Item 7, MANAGEMENT S
DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF
OPERATION, at page 32, for a discussion of accounting developments. 

   In addition, the staff of the U. S. Securities and Exchange
Commission has questioned certain of the current accounting practices
of the electric utility industry, including those of WPSC, regarding
the recognition, measurement and classification of nuclear
decommissioning costs for nuclear generation facilities in the
financial statements of electric utilities.  In response to these
questions, the Financial Accounting Standards Board has agreed to
review the accounting for nuclear decommissioning costs.  If current
electric utility industry accounting practices for such
decommissioning are changed: (1) the annual provisions for

                                    -21-
<PAGE>
decommissioning could increase; and (2) the estimated cost for
decommissioning could be recorded as a liability rather than as
accumulated depreciation.  WPSC does not believe that such changes, if
required, would have an adverse effect on results of operations due to
its current and future ability to recover decommissioning costs
through customer rates.

   The PSCW certified new straight-line depreciation rates which
became effective January 1, 1994 concurrent with the implementation of
new customer rates.  The result was a reduction in annual depreciation
expense of approximately $5.8 million.  

   Regulatory assets represent probable future revenue associated
with certain costs which will be recovered from customers through the
ratemaking process.  Regulatory liabilities represent costs previously
collected that are refundable in future rates.  At December 31, 1994,
regulatory assets and liabilities amounted to $109.1 million and
$66.0 million, respectively.  Based on prior and current rate
treatment of such deferred charges, management believes it is probable
that WPSC will continue to recover these costs from ratepayers. 
Pursuant to a PSCW rate order, effective January 1, 1995, WPSC is to
recover approximately $23.6 million of deferred regulatory costs each
year.

   DIVIDEND RESTRICTIONS. WPSC is restricted by a PSCW order to
paying normal dividends of no more than 109% of the previous year's
common stock dividend without prior notice to the PSCW.  Also,
Wisconsin law prohibits WPSC from making loans to the Company and its
non-regulated subsidiaries and from guaranteeing their obligations.



                           G.  CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS
 
   Anticipated construction expenditures for 1995 are $84.2 million,
of which $53.1 million, $1.3 million, $24.4 million, and $5.4 million
are for electric construction, nuclear fuel, gas construction, and
other construction expenditures, respectively.   Approximately 60% of
the expenditures for 1995, and 97% of the anticipated total capital
expenditures of $150.6 million during 1996 and 1997, are expected to
be financed through internal sources.  WPSC does not expect to sell
equity or long-term debt during this period.  Expenditures related to
the REC are not reflected in the above amounts because a subsidiary of
WPSC anticipates entering into a project financing arrangement with
respect to the $169 million facility.



                                 H. EMPLOYEES

   At December 31, 1994, WPSC employed 2,572 persons.  Of this
number, 2,093 and 479 were considered electric and gas utility
employees, respectively.


                                    -22-
<PAGE>     
   Approximately 1,070 WPSC employees are represented by Local 310
of the International Union of Operating Engineers ("Union").  During
1994, the Union ratified a new contract with WPSC which provides for
work force flexibility in that, for the duration of the contract,
Union employees can perform traditional union work across craft lines,
perform non-union work and perform work traditionally performed by
contractors; and non-union employees can perform some union work.  
The current contract runs through October of 1997.  There has never
been a strike against WPSC by its employees.

ITEM 3.  LEGAL PROCEEDINGS  

   SHEBOYGAN GAS PLANT.  In November of 1990, WPSC was notified by
the DNR that it may be a PRP for environmental contamination found on
property next to the Sheboygan River previously used by WPSC for the
gasification of coal in the City of Sheboygan, Wisconsin (the
"Sheboygan II Gas Plant"). WPSC last used the property for this
purpose in approximately 1930.  In 1966, the property was sold and is
now owned by the City of Sheboygan.  The DNR has offered WPSC the
opportunity to investigate and remediate the property under an
agreement with the State of Wisconsin as opposed to having the site
handled by the EPA as part of the larger Sheboygan River and Harbor
Superfund site. WPSC, the City of Sheboygan and the State of Wisconsin
have negotiated an agreement for performing the work, and therefore,
Wisconsin, and not the EPA, will be handling this matter.

   An initial study was completed on the site which confirmed the
presence of contaminants that appear to be related to the Sheboygan II
Gas Plant.  A follow-up investigation was recommended by the
environmental consultant to determine more precisely the scope of the
contamination and to determine if any contamination is migrating from
off-site. WPSC is awaiting approval from the DNR for the additional
work.  After the follow-up investigation is completed, the City of
Sheboygan and WPSC will negotiate an allocation of the costs
associated with cleanup of the site.  Based on the initial study, and
a more detailed investigation of WPSC's former Oshkosh site, it is
believed that the cost of cleanup for the Sheboygan II Gas Plant site
could be as much as $2.6 million.  The estimates presented above do
not take into consideration any recovery from insurance carriers or
other third parties which WPSC is pursuing.     
   

   OSHKOSH GAS PLANT.  In April of 1992, WPSC received an order from
the DNR directing it to complete an investigation and implement
remedial activities on property owned by WPSC in the City of Oshkosh,
Wisconsin.  Previously, WPSC had operated a manufactured gas plant on
the property from 1883 until 1946.  A challenge to the order was filed
on May 8, 1992, and WPSC and the DNR have negotiated the terms of a
consent order.  An environmental consultant conducted an investigation
in late 1993 and a more detailed investigation in 1994.  Based on the
more detailed investigation, the cost of remediation is estimated to
be as much as $2.6 million.  Additional studies are planned to define
further the area of contamination (primary river sediments).  The
results of these studies may affect the cost estimate for remediation
based on the nature and extent of contamination.  The City of Oshkosh
has claimed that contaminated groundwater from the former gas plant
property has migrated onto city-owned land.  WPSC has agreed to stay
the statute of limitations that may be applicable to the City of
Oshkosh's claim in order to avoid the filing of a lawsuit by the City
of Oshkosh.  WPSC is continuing to evaluate the validity of the City

                                    -25-
<PAGE>
of Oshkosh's claim as additional data is received.  The estimates
presented above do not take into consideration any recovery from
insurance carriers or other third parties which WPSC is pursuing.

(1)  The dividends paid to public shareholders for all of 1993 and the first
     three quarters of 1994 were paid by WPSC.  As the result of the
     reorganization described in Part I, Item 1A, GENERAL, at page 1, the
     dividend for the fourth quarter of 1994 was paid by the Company.

WPSC, the Company's principal subsidiary, is restricted by a PSCW order to
paying normal dividends of no more than 109% of the previous year's common
stock dividend without prior notice to the PSCW.  Also, Wisconsin law
prohibits WPSC from making loans to the Company and its subsidiaries and from
guaranteeing their obligations.

         CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATION


RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

WPS Resources Corporation ("Company") is a holding company.  Over 99%
of the Company's assets and revenues are derived from Wisconsin Public
Service Corporation ("WPSC"), an electric and gas utility.

Overview of 1994 Compared to 1993

Earnings per share declined from $2.47 in 1993 to $2.21 in 1994, or
10.5%.  The most significant reason for this decrease was a Public
Service Commission of Wisconsin ("PSCW") order decreasing the
authorized return on common equity for WPSC from 12.3% to 11.3%,
thereby reducing earnings approximately $.16 per share.

1994 Compared to 1993

Electric margins declined by $17.3 million, or 5.0%, due primarily to
reduced electric rates.

______________________________________________________________________

Electric operating revenues decreased $12.4 million, or 2.5%,
primarily due to a 4.2% reduction in Wisconsin retail rates that took
effect January 1, 1994.  Electric revenues also were reduced .5% in
May 1994 as a result of reduced fuel costs.  These decreases were
partially offset by a 4.0% increase in kilowatt-hour ("kwh") sales. 
Residential, commercial and industrial kwh sales increased 2.4% and
4.9%, respectively, due to a warmer summer and customer growth. 
Wholesale kwh sales increased 3.0%.

Electric fuels and purchases increased $4.9 million, or 3.4%,
reflecting increased sales, offset in part by reduced production
costs.  Electric production fuels decreased $3.0 million, or 2.7%,
even though generation was up 1.3%.  This decrease in fuel costs per
kwh of 5.4% primarily was the result of purchasing less expensive coal
on the spot market.  Purchased power costs were higher by
$7.9 million, or 25.8%.  This was the result of a 19.9% increase in
kwh purchases, due to the severe cold weather in the first quarter of
the year, which forced WPSC to purchase expensive spot market
electricity, and the Soo Line railroad strike during the second half
of the year which impacted WPSC's ability to operate its coal-fired units.

Gas margins increased by $1.9 million, or 3.6%, due to customer
growth.

The PSCW allows WPSC to pass on to its customers, through a purchased
gas adjustment clause, changes in the cost of gas.

Maintenance expense decreased $1.6 million, or 3.1%, due to lower
maintenance activity at the Kewaunee Nuclear Power Plant ("Kewaunee")
and to less electric transmission and distribution maintenance.

Depreciation and decommissioning expense decreased $4.2 million, or
7.0%.  The primary cause was a rate order from the PSCW which took
effect January 1, 1994 reducing the annual depreciation provision by
an estimated $5.8 million.  This was offset by higher decommissioning
expense of approximately $1.1 million.

Federal and state income taxes decreased $3.0 million, or 9.4%, due to
lower earnings.

1993 Compared to 1992

Electric operating revenues increased $15.6 million, or 3.3%.  This
increase was the result of a 4.2% increase in kwh sales and a 2.1%
rate increase for WPSC's Wisconsin retail customers that was effective
January 1, 1993.  This was partially offset by rate reductions
totaling $1.1 million in September and November 1993 for Wisconsin
retail customers due to reduced fuel costs.  Residential sales
increased $8.9 million, or 5.7%, due primarily to warmer summer
weather.  Commercial and industrial sales rose $13.3 million, or 5.3%,
reflecting customer growth and the impact of the warmer weather. 
Wholesale sales decreased $4.5 million, or 7.4%, due to an average
rate reduction for this customer class of 6.7%.

Electric production fuel costs decreased $9.8 million, or 7.9%, even
though electric generation was up 2.1%.  This decrease primarily was
the result of less expensive coal which was purchased on the spot
market.  Such purchases decreased overall coal-related costs per kwh
by 11.8% and reduced coal costs by approximately $14.2 million between
years.  


                                    -32-
<PAGE>
Gas operating revenues increased $30.2 million, or 19.2%.  This
increase primarily is due to a 10.1% increase in the cost of gas
($12.2 million), reflecting spot market volatility, a 3.2% increase in
heating-degree days ($12.5 million) and a 2.3% Wisconsin retail rate
increase ($5.5 million) effective January 1, 1993.  Residential gas
revenues increased $17.3 million, and commercial and industrial gas
revenues increased $14.6 million. 

Gas purchased for resale increased $23.5 million, or 21.3%, due to
higher gas volumes of 10.4% and to a 10.1% higher average cost of gas
per therm.

Other operating expenses increased $12.7 million, or 9.3%, primarily
due to increased amortization of 1991 coal and associated rail
contract buy-out costs of $2.9 million and increased electric and gas
conservation expenses of $9.7 million.

Maintenance expense increased $5.1 million, or 10.9%, primarily due to
additional maintenance activities at WPSC's coal-fired power plants.

Federal and state income taxes increased $5.9 million, or 21.7%, due
to higher pre-tax income and the effect of an increase in the federal
income tax rate from 34% to 35%, as provided in the Revenue
Reconciliation Act of 1993.


BALANCE SHEET

1994 Compared to 1993

Accrued utility revenues decreased $8.5 million as a result of
unseasonably warm weather experienced in December 1994.

Long-term liabilities increased $20.6 million primarily due to higher
estimates for environmental remediation of $10.4 million and post-
retirement health care costs of $7.0 million.


FINANCIAL CONDITION

WPSC requires large investments in capital assets used to deliver
electric and gas services. Most of the Company's capital requirements
relate to WPSC's construction expenditures. WPSC maintains good
liquidity levels and a financial condition considered to be strong by
analysts.  Internally generated funds closely approximate the
utility's cash requirements.  No external funding difficulties are
anticipated in the future.  Pre-tax interest coverage was 4.2 times
for the year ended December 31, 1994.  WPSC's bond ratings are AA+
(Standard & Poor's), Aa2 (Moody's) and AA+ (Duff & Phelps). 

WPSC is restricted by a PSCW order from paying dividends, without PSCW
approval, of more than 109% of the previous year's common stock
dividend.  Also, Wisconsin law prohibits WPSC from making loans to the
Company and its subsidiaries and from guaranteeing their obligations. 

For the three-year period 1995 to 1997, internally-generated funds at
WPSC are expected to lag behind construction expenditures, which total
$235 million, by $38 million.  WPSC currently expects to finance this
shortfall in internally-generated funds with short-term debt.  These
expenditures are comprised of $148 million for electric construction,
$20 million for nuclear fuel, $48 million for gas construction and
$19 million for other construction expenditures. These construction
costs exclude the Rhinelander Energy Center ("REC") which will be
substantially funded with non-recourse project financing debt.

The PSCW has approved the REC as the preferred electric generating
project to meet WPSC's expanding capacity and energy needs. This
approval followed a competitive bidding process.  The REC will be
built and operated by non-regulated subsidiaries of WPSC.  REC will be
a coal-fired, 122-megawatt, $169 million cogeneration facility which
will produce steam and electricity for sale to the Rhinelander Paper
Company and electricity for sale to utility customers.  Before
construction commences, the PSCW must certify that the REC satisfies a
public need.  PSCW approval is expected in the second half of 1995. 
The plant is expected to be placed in service in 1998.

Kewaunee is currently licensed through the year 2013.  Physical
decommissioning is expected to occur during the period 2014 to 2021
with additional expenditures being incurred during the period 2022 to
2050.  Decommissioning costs in current dollars are $147 million, and
the undiscounted amount is $785 million.  As of December 31, 1994,
$64.1 million has been placed in external trusts to cover these future
costs.  Management 


                                    -33-
<PAGE>
does not anticipate decommissioning to have any negative impacts on
WPSC's liquidity or capital resources, since these costs are currently
funded through external decommissioning trusts.

WPSC received a two-year rate order from the PSCW which became
effective January 1, 1995.  This rate order decreased electric retail
rates by 2.6% and kept retail gas rates at current levels.  This order
also increased the authorized rate of return on common equity from
11.3% to 11.5%.

Statement of Financial Accounting Standards ("SFAS") No. 112,
Employers' Accounting for Post-Employment Benefits, became effective
in 1994.  This statement establishes the accounting and reporting
standard for the estimated cost of benefits provided by an employer to
former or inactive employees after employment but before retirement. 
The effect of this statement was not material.

SFAS No. 115, Accounting for Certain Investments in Debt and Equity
Securities, became effective in 1994.  This statement establishes the
accounting and reporting standard for investments in debt and
marketable equity securities.  This standard primarily impacts nuclear
decommissioning investments.  The effect of this statement was not
material.  

SFAS No. 119, Disclosure about Derivative Financial Instruments and
Fair Value of Financial Instruments, also became effective in 1994. 
This statement establishes disclosure requirements for derivatives. 
As of December 31, 1994, the Company had no derivatives.


TRENDS

WPSC follows SFAS No. 71, Accounting for the Effects of Certain Types
of Regulation, and its financial statements reflect the effects of the
different ratemaking principles followed by the various jurisdictions
regulating the utility.  These include the PSCW, 89% of revenues, the
Michigan Public Service Commission, 2% of revenues, and the Federal
Energy Regulatory Commission ("FERC"), 9% of revenues.  In addition,
Kewaunee is regulated by the Nuclear Regulatory Commission. 
Environmental matters are primarily governed by the Environmental
Protection Agency and the Wisconsin Department of Natural Resources.

The single most important development in the electric utility industry
is the trend toward increased competition brought about by a
combination of new legislation, changing regulation and market forces. 
Transmission access, mandated by the Energy Policy Act of 1992, 
increased competition in the wholesale power segment of the business
and put pressure on profit margins.  Certain segments of the industry
could become deregulated.  Low-cost energy producers, such as WPSC,
are in a position to benefit from competitive markets.  

The PSCW has initiated a proceeding to consider restructuring electric
utility regulation in Wisconsin.  Matters to be addressed include:

     -   Whether generation, transmission and distribution functions
         will be allowed to exist together in the same company.

     -   Whether retail wheeling should be allowed.

     -   Whether utilities should be obligated to serve those customers
         who have the ability to choose between alternate suppliers.

     -   Whether utilities will be given the ability to price services
         based on market factors rather than the traditional
         regulatory-pricing model.

     -   The treatment of stranded investment in utility plant and
         regulatory assets. 

In order to address the complexities in the natural gas market
resulting from FERC Order 636, which became effective in November
1993, the Company formed a non-regulated subsidiary, WPS Energy
Services, Inc., to market energy and related services. 

WPSC has accrued $26.9 million for the future environmental
remediation of eight manufactured gas plant sites which it operated
previously.  This accrual is based on studies at two sites and was
used as the basis for projecting costs on the remaining six sites. 
The range of cleanup costs for all eight sites is estimated to be from
$14.8 million to $29.3 million.

These estimates will be adjusted as additional site-specific studies
are completed, three of which are anticipated in 1995.  Factors that
can impact future cost estimates include the volume of contaminated
soil and changes in remedial technology and regulatory requirements. 
A recent Wisconsin rate order provides that these costs may be
recovered from customers over a five-year period after expenditures
are incurred, but that no return on unrecovered costs is permitted.  

The estimated cleanup costs presented do not take into consideration
recovery from insurance carriers or


                                    -34-
<PAGE>
other third parties.  In June 1994, the Wisconsin Supreme Court
("Court") held that insurance coverage was not available for
environmental cleanup costs to the extent the clean up is done to
prevent or mitigate future injury.  The Court also held that a
notification letter from a government agency about an environmental
situation did not constitute a suit, triggering the insurers' duty to
defend.  WPSC is exploring alternative approaches for pursuing claims
against carriers in light of the decision.

In addition, WPSC has been notified that it is a minor participant in
a number of waste disposal site cleanup efforts.  However, no
significant costs are anticipated to clean up these sites.

Federal Clean Air Act Amendments ("Act") were enacted in 1990.  The
Act establishes stringent sulfur dioxide and nitrogen oxide emission
limitations.  Wisconsin previously had enacted laws to limit sulfur
emissions.  WPSC meets the sulfur dioxide emission standards scheduled
to take effect in the year 2000 as a result of switching to lower-
sulfur fuels.  However, some additional capital expenditures will be
required to upgrade existing equipment and to monitor emission levels. 
These expenditures are estimated to be in the range of $15 million to
$25 million between 1995 and 1999.

The steam generator tubes at Kewaunee are susceptible to corrosion
characteristics seen throughout the nuclear industry.  Annual
inspections are performed to identify degraded tubes which are either
repaired by sleeving or are removed from service by plugging.  The
steam generators were designed with approximately a 15% heat-transfer
margin, meaning that full power should be sustainable with the
equivalent of 15% of the steam generator tubes plugged.  Tube plugging
and the build-up of deposits on the tubes affect the heat-transfer
capability of the steam generators to the point where eventually full
power operation is not possible, and there is a gradual decrease in
the capacity of the plant. The plant's capacity could be reduced by as
much as 20% by the year 2013.  To date, approximately 12% of the tubes
have been plugged, with no reduction in capacity.  WPSC continues to
evaluate the operation of the steam generators without replacement and
appropriate repair strategies, including replacement. WPSC also
continues to evaluate and implement initiatives to improve the
performance of Kewaunee which already performs at above-average levels
for the industry.  These initiatives include conversion from a twelve-
month to an eighteen-month refueling and major maintenance cycle,
beginning in the spring of 1995, and numerous other cost-reduction
measures. These initiatives have resulted in approximately a 25%
reduction in Kewaunee operating and maintenance costs since 1991. WPSC
intends to operate Kewaunee until at least the expiration of the
present operating license in 2013.

In 1995, WPSC is initiating a new demand-side management ("DSM")
program which involves loans and shared savings.  Prior to 1995, DSM
expenditures were recovered from all customers.  The new program
provides that those who benefit from energy-saving programs will
finance them.  As of December 31, 1994, WPSC had $46.5 million of
deferred DSM expenditures which will be recovered in future rates.

Local 310 of the International Union of Operating Engineers,
representing 1,070 of WPSC's employees, ratified a new three-year
contract with WPSC.  The agreement provides for work force flexibility
in that, for the duration of the contract, union employees can perform
traditional union work across craft lines, perform non-union work and
perform work traditionally performed by contractors; and non-union
employees can perform some union work.  The flexibility that this
contract provides will allow WPSC to more easily adapt to the changing
utility environment.


IMPACT OF INFLATION

Current financial statements are prepared in accordance with generally
accepted accounting principles and report operating results in terms
of historic cost.  They provide a reasonable, objective and
quantifiable statement of financial results, but they do not evaluate
the impact of inflation.  Under rate treatment prescribed by the
utility's regulatory commissions, projected operating costs are
recoverable in revenues. Because forecasts are prepared assuming
inflation, the majority of inflationary effects on normal operating
costs are recoverable in rates. However, in these forecasts, WPSC only
is allowed to recover the historical cost of plant via depreciation.

Although new rates will not be implemented in 1996 due to the two-year
rate order in the Wisconsin jurisdiction, management believes
inflation will be offset by the impact of customer growth and
increased productivity.

                E.  NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

(1)  SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

     (a)  Corporate Reorganization - On September 1, 1994, WPS
          Resources Corporation ("Company"), pursuant to a one-for-one
          share exchange, acquired all of the common stock of
          Wisconsin Public Service Corporation ("WPSC").  As a result,
          WPSC became a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company.  The
          financial statements of the Company have been consolidated
          with the operations of its subsidiaries for all periods
          presented.  As of December 31, 1994, WPSC, an electric and
          gas utility, represented over 99% of the Company s
          consolidated assets, revenues and net income.

          Preferred stock dividends of WPSC have been retroactively
          restated as a nonoperating expense.  Thus, the Company's net
          income is $3.3 million and $3.2 million less than WPSC's net
          income for the years ended December 31, 1993 and 1992,
          respectively.  This restatement does not impact earnings per
          share of common stock.

          Certain prior-period amounts in the consolidated financial
          statements have been reclassified to conform with current-
          year presentations.

     (b)  Consolidation - The consolidated financial statements
          include the Company and its wholly-owned subsidiaries,
          WPS Energy Services, Inc. ("WPSE"), WPSC and WPSC's wholly-
          owned subsidiary, WPS Leasing, Inc.  All significant
          intercompany transactions and accounts have been eliminated.

     (c)  Utility Plant - Utility plant is stated at the original cost
          of construction which includes an allowance for funds used
          during construction ("AFUDC").  Approximately 50% of retail
          jurisdictional construction work in progress ("CWIP"),
          except for major new generating facilities which earn AFUDC
          on the full amount, is subject to AFUDC using a rate based
          on WPSC's overall cost of capital.  For 1994, the retail
          AFUDC rate was approximately 10.1%.

          AFUDC is recorded on wholesale jurisdictional electric CWIP
          at debt and equity percentages specified in the FERC Uniform
          System of Accounts.  For 1994, this rate was approximately
          4.3%.

          Substantially all of WPSC's utility plant is subject to a
          first mortgage lien.

     (d)  Property Additions, Maintenance and Retirements - The cost
          of renewals and betterments of units of property (as
          distinguished from minor items of property) is charged to
          utility plant accounts.  The cost of units of property
          retired, sold or otherwise disposed of, plus removal costs,


                                    -41-
<PAGE>
          less salvage, is charged to the accumulated provision for
          depreciation.  No profit or loss is recognized in connection
          with ordinary retirements of utility property units. 
          Maintenance and repair costs and replacement and renewal of
          items less than units of property are generally charged to
          operating expense.  

          In October 1993, WPSC sold, at cost, a 32% interest in a
          combustion turbine to a municipality for $7.8 million.

     (e)  Depreciation - Straight-line composite depreciation expense
          is recorded over the estimated useful life of the property
          and includes estimated salvage and cost of removal.  These
          rates have been approved by the Public Service Commission of
          Wisconsin ("PSCW").  Effective January 1, 1994, depreciation
          rates were revised based on new estimates which decreased
          annual depreciation expense by approximately $5.8 million. 
          This decrease was considered in setting customer rates.

          ============================================================
                                          1994        1993       1992
          ------------------------------------------------------------
          Annual composite 
          depreciation rates
          Electric                        3.41%       3.89%      3.87%
          Gas                             3.37%       3.81%      3.81%
          ============================================================

     (f)  Nuclear Decommissioning - Nuclear decommissioning costs are
          accrued over the estimated service life of the Kewaunee
          Nuclear Power Plant ("Kewaunee"), currently recovered from
          customers in rates and deposited in external trusts.  Such
          costs totaled $4.0, $2.4 and $2.4 million for 1994, 1993 and
          1992, respectively.  In July 1994, the PSCW issued a generic
          order covering utilities with nuclear generation. This order
          standardizes the escalation assumptions used in determining
          nuclear decommissioning liabilities.  The undiscounted
          amount of decommissioning costs estimated to be expended
          between the years 2014 to 2050 are $785 million.  Long-term
          after-tax earnings of 5.5% are assumed.  As a result of this
          change, annual decommissioning costs recovered in customer
          rates in 1995 will be approximately $8.7 million.  As of
          December 31, 1994, the accumulated provision for
          depreciation and decommissioning included accumulated
          provisions for decommissioning totaling $64.1 million. 

          WPSC's share of Kewaunee decommissioning costs are estimated
          to be $147 million in current dollars based on a site-
          specific study, performed in 1992, using immediate
          dismantlement as the method of decommissioning.  As of
          December 31, 1994, the external trusts totaled $64.1 million
          and were valued at market.  


                                    -42-
<PAGE>
          Depreciation expense includes decommissioning costs
          recovered in customer rates and a charge to offset earnings
          from the external trusts.  Trust earnings totaled $2.4, $3.5
          and $3.3 million for the years ended December 31, 1994, 1993
          and 1992, respectively.

     (g)  Nuclear Fuel - The cost of nuclear fuel is amortized to
          electric production fuel expense based on the quantity of
          heat produced for the generation of electric energy by
          Kewaunee.  The costs amortized to electric fuel expense
          (which assume no salvage values for uranium or plutonium)
          include an amount for ultimate disposal and are recovered
          through current rates.  As required by the Nuclear Waste
          Policy Act of 1982, a contract with the Department of Energy
          ("DOE") has been signed, and quarterly payments are being
          made to the DOE for the fuel storage based on generation. 
          Interim storage space for spent nuclear fuel is provided at
          Kewaunee, and expenses associated with this storage are
          recognized as current operating costs.  Currently, there is
          on-site storage capacity for spent fuel through the year
          2013.  As of December 31, 1994 and 1993, the accumulated
          provisions for nuclear fuel totaled $136.5 million and
          $130.0 million, respectively.

     (h)  Cash and Equivalents - The Company considers short-term
          investments with an original maturity of three months or
          less to be cash equivalents.

     (i)  Revenue and Customer Receivables - WPSC accrues revenues
          related to electric and gas service, including estimated
          amounts for service rendered but not billed.

          As of December 31, 1994, energy conservation loans to
          customers amounting to $1.7 million are included in customer
          receivables and in investments and other assets.  The
          carrying amount of the loans closely approximates their
          market value.

          Automatic fuel-adjustment clauses are used for FERC
          wholesale-electric and Michigan Public Service Commission
          ("MPSC") retail-electric portions of WPSC's business.  The
          PSCW retail-electric portion of the business uses a "cost
          variance range approach."  This range is based on a specific
          estimated fuel cost for the next year.  If WPSC's actual
          fuel costs fall outside this range, a hearing may be held
          and an adjustment to future rates may result.  WPSC has a
          purchased gas adjustment clause which allows it to pass on
          to all classes of gas customers changes in the cost of gas
          purchased from its suppliers, subject to PSCW and MPSC
          review. 

          WPSC is required to provide service and grant credit to
          customers within its defined service territory and is
          precluded from discontinuing service to residential

                                    -43-
<PAGE>
          customers during certain periods of the year.  WPSC
          continually reviews its customers' credit-worthiness and
          obtains deposits or refunds deposits accordingly.  WPSC is
          permitted to recover bad debts in utility rates.  

          Approximately 8% of WPSC's total revenues are from companies
          in the paper products industry.                 

     (j)  Regulatory Assets and Liabilities - WPSC is subject to the
          provisions of Statement of Financial Accounting Standard
          ("SFAS") No. 71, Accounting for the Effects of Certain Types
          of Regulation.  Regulatory assets represent probable future
          revenue associated with certain costs which will be
          recovered from customers through the ratemaking process.
          Regulatory liabilities represent costs previously collected
          that are refundable in future rates.  The following
          regulatory assets and liabilities were reflected in the
          Consolidated Balance Sheets as of December 31:

          As of December 31, 1994, most of WPSC's regulatory assets
          are being recovered through rates charged to customers over
          periods ranging from two to ten years.  Pursuant to a PSCW
          rate order, effective January 1, 1995, WPSC is to recover
          approximately $23.6 million of regulatory costs per year.

          Based on prior and current rate treatment of such costs,
          management believes it is probable that WPSC will continue
          to recover from ratepayers the deferred charges described
          above.

          See notes (1)(l) and (1)(m) for specific discussion of
          pension and deferred tax regulatory liabilities, and note 6
          for discussion of environmental-remediation deferred costs.

     (k)  Investments and Other Assets - Investments include various
          immaterial affiliates whose income is included in other
          income and deductions using the equity method of accounting. 
          Other assets include prepaid pension assets, operating
          deposits for jointly-owned plants, the cash surrender value
          of life insurance policies and the long-term portion of
          energy conservation loans to customers.

     (l)  Employee Benefit Plans - WPSC has non-contributory
          retirement plans covering substantially all employees under
          which annual contributions are made to an irrevocable trust
          established to provide retired employees with a monthly
          payment if conditions relating to age and length of service
          have been met.  The plans are fully funded, and no
          contributions were made in 1994, 1993 or 1992.  Prior to
          January 1, 1993, the PSCW required the recognition of the
          funded amounts for ratemaking purposes.  Concurrent with a
          rate order, effective January 1, 1993, WPSC began recovering
          pension costs in customer rates under SFAS No. 87,
          Employers' Accounting for Pensions, and began returning to
          ratepayers, over five years, the cumulative excess of
          amounts recovered from customers over SFAS No. 87 costs.

          The tables below set forth the plans' funded status and
          expense (income).

          WPSC also offers medical, dental and life insurance benefits
          to employees, retirees and their dependents.  The expenses
          for active employees are expensed as incurred.  Prior to
          1993, WPSC expensed amounts related to post-retirement
          health and welfare plans to the extent that such amounts
          were funded to external trusts.

          Effective January 1, 1993, and concurrent with a rate order,
          WPSC adopted SFAS No. 106, Employers' Accounting for Post-
          Retirement Benefits Other Than Pensions, which requires the
          cost of post-retirement benefits for employees to be accrued
          as expense over the period in which the employee renders
          service and becomes eligible to receive benefits.  In
          adopting SFAS No. 106, WPSC elected to recognize the
          transition obligation for current and future retirees over
          twenty years.

          Since 1981, WPSC has been funding amounts to irrevocable
          trusts as allowed for income tax purposes.    

          These funded amounts have been expensed and recovered
          through customer rates.  The investments in the trust
          covering administrative employees are subject to federal
          income taxes at a 39.6% tax rate, while the non-
          administrative trust is tax-exempt.

          The tables below set forth the plans' accrued post-
          retirement benefit obligation ("APBO") as of December 31,
          1994 and 1993 and the expense provision for the years then

          The assumed expected long-term return on investments and the
          discount rate used to measure the APBO under SFAS No. 106
          are consistent with rates used to calculate the pension
          plans' funded status and expense under SFAS No. 87.  The
          assumed health care cost trend rates for 1995 are 11.5% for
          medical and 8.5% for dental, decreasing to 7.0% and 5.0%,
          respectively, by the year 2006.  Increasing each of the
          medical and dental cost trend rates by 1% in each year would
          increase the total APBO as of December 31, 1994 by
          $24.7 million and the total net periodic post-retirement
          benefit cost for the year then ended by $4.1 million.

                                    -47-
<PAGE>
          During 1992, the cost of post-retirement health care
          benefits was $2.7 million.  As of December 31, 1994, WPSC
          had approximately 1,000 retirees eligible to receive health
          care benefits.

          Concurrent with a rate order which was effective January 1,
          1994, WPSC adopted SFAS No. 112, Employers' Accounting for
          Post-Employment Benefits, which establishes accounting and
          reporting standards for post-employment benefits other than
          those covered by SFAS Nos. 87 and 106.  In connection
          therewith, WPSC expensed in 1994 the transition obligation
          of $1.8 million and recovered this cost through its customer
          rates.

          WPSC has a leveraged Employee Stock Ownership Plan and Trust
          ("ESOP") that held 2,240,500 shares of Company common stock
          (market value of approximately $59.9 million) at
          December 31, 1994.  At that date, the ESOP also had loans
          guaranteed by WPSC and secured by the common stock.  At
          December 31, 1994, these loans had recorded values of
          $1.8 million (bearing an interest rate of 73.5% of prime
          rate) and $18.2 million (bearing an interest rate of 9.33%). 
          The estimated market value of these loans at December 31,
          1994 totaled $20.5 million.

          Principal and interest on the loans are to be paid through
          WPSC contributions and through dividends on Company common
          stock held by the ESOP.  Shares in the ESOP are allocated to
          participants as the loans are repaid.  Tax benefits from
          dividends paid to the ESOP are recognized as a reduction in
          WPSC's cost of providing service to customers.  The PSCW has
          allowed WPSC to include in cost of service an additional
          employer contribution to the plan.  The net effect of the
          tax benefits and of the employee contribution is an
          approximately equal sharing of benefits of the program
          between customers and employees.

     (m)  Income Taxes - Effective January 1, 1993, WPSC adopted the
          liability method of accounting for income taxes as
          prescribed by SFAS No. 109, Accounting for Income Taxes. 
          Under the liability method, deferred income tax liabilities
          are established based upon enacted tax laws and rates
          applicable to the periods in which the taxes become payable. 
          The adoption of this accounting standard had an
          insignificant impact on the Company's net income.  The
          excess deferred income taxes, resulting from taxes provided
          at rates greater than current rates, and the previously
          unrecorded deferred income taxes, have been recorded as a
          net regulatory liability to be refunded to customers in
          future years.  Such net regulatory liability totaled
          $38.6 million as of December 31, 1994.

          The effective income tax rates are computed by dividing
          total income tax expense, including investment credit

                                    -48-
<PAGE>
          restored, by the sum of such expense and net income. 
          Previously deferred investment tax credits are being
          restored over the life of the related utility plant.  The
          components of income tax expense are set forth in the tables
          below.

(2)  COMMERCIAL PAPER AND LINES OF CREDIT  

     To support outstanding commercial paper, the Company maintains
     unused bank lines of credit.  Some of these lines may be
     withdrawn at the discretion of the lenders.  While some cash
     balances represent compensating balances for credit lines and
     bank services, there are no legal restrictions as to withdrawal
     of these funds.  The majority of the lines of credit require a
     fee based on the unused balance.

     The following information relates to short-term borrowings and
     lines of credit for the years indicated:

</TABLE>

     Included in the above lines of credit are agreements with
     commercial banks that permit the Company to borrow up to
     $16 million at any time provided there is compliance with certain
     financial covenants.  These agreements extend for thirteen months
     or more.  As of December 31, 1994, no borrowings were outstanding
     under these agreements.

          ==============================================================================
</TABLE>

     WPSC's share of direct expenses for these plants is included in
     the corresponding operating expenses in the consolidated
     statements of income, and WPSC has supplied its own financing for
     all jointly-owned projects.

(4)  LONG-TERM DEBT

     Sinking fund requirements on first mortgage bonds may be
     satisfied by the deposit of cash or reacquired bonds with the
     trustee and, for certain series, by the application of net
     expenditures for bondable property in an amount equal to 166-2/3%
     of the annual requirements.

     All series requiring the deposit of cash or reacquired bonds for
     sinking fund purposes have been satisfied to maturity.  For those
     series requiring unpledged property to satisfy sinking fund
     requirements, the Company has adequate unpledged property to
     satisfy the requirement for at least ten years.  

     In 1998, $50 million of 5-1/4% bonds will mature.

     As of December 31, 1994, the market value of WPSC's first
     mortgage bonds was $273.0 million.  These bonds have a recorded
     value of $291.1 million.  Historically, gains or losses resulting
     from the settlement on long-term debt obligations have been
     deferred as required by regulators.


(5)  COMMON EQUITY  

     In June 1992, 800,000 shares of new common stock were issued. 
     This sale increased the common stock balance by $3.2 million
     ($4 par per share) and premium on capital by $19.4 million
     ($24.25 per share).  Also, beginning in June 1992, WPSC commenced
     a sale of shares to meet dividend reinvestment program ("DRP")
     requirements.  During 1994 and 1993, no and 50,818 new shares of
     common stock, respectively, were issued under the DRP and 391,658
     shares were available for issuance at December 31, 1994.  In
     April 1993, WPSC stopped issuing common stock under the DRP and
     began purchasing common stock on the open market for shareholder
     reinvested dividends.

     At December 31, 1994, the Company had $296.6 million of retained
     earnings available for dividends; however, WPSC is restricted by
     a PSCW order to paying dividends of no more than 109% of the
     previous year's common stock dividend without PSCW approval.
     Also, Wisconsin law prohibits WPSC from making loans to the
     Company and its subsidiaries and from guaranteeing their
     obligations. The WPSC equity capitalization ratio at December 31,
     1994 was 54% which is the same rate approved by the PSCW for
     ratemaking purposes.

(6)  COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES  

     COAL CONTRACTS

     To ensure a reliable, low-cost supply of coal, WPSC entered into
     certain long-term contracts that have take-or-pay obligations
     totaling $323.7 million from 1995 through 2016. The obligations


                                    -51-
<PAGE>
     are subject to force majeure provisions which provide WPSC other
     options if the specified coal does not meet emission limits which
     may be mandated in future legislation.  In the opinion of
     management, any amounts paid under the take-or-pay obligations
     described above would be legitimate costs of service subject to
     recovery in customer rates.

     GAS COSTS
     
     WPSC also has natural gas supply and transportation contracts
     that require total demand payments of $412.3 million through
     October 2003.  Management believes that these costs will be
     recoverable in future customer rates.

     ANR Pipeline Company ("ANR"), WPSC's primary pipeline supplier,
     filed with the FERC for approval to recover a portion of certain
     take-or-pay costs it incurred from renegotiating its long-term
     gas contracts.  As a result of the filing, ANR was allowed to
     recover a portion of these costs from its customers.  WPSC began
     paying its share of these take-or-pay costs to ANR in 1989 and
     recovering these costs directly from customers through its
     purchased gas adjustment clause.  In March 1991, the FERC
     approved the settlement under which WPSC will pay ANR monthly
     take-or-pay amounts.  Additional take-or-pay claims by ANR may be
     filed with FERC. To date, the PSCW has granted WPSC recovery of
     all take-or-pay costs.  

     In April 1992, the FERC issued Order No. 636 ("Order") which
     requires natural gas pipelines to restructure their sales and
     transportation services.  As a result of this Order, WPSC is
     obligated to pay for a portion of ANRs transition costs incurred
     to comply with the Order.  At December 31, 1994, WPSC has an
     accrued liability with an offsetting regulatory asset in the
     amount of $1.9 million for a portion of these transition costs. 
     Though there may be additional costs, which could be significant,
     the amount and timing of these costs are unknown at this time. 
     Management expects to recover these costs in future customer
     rates.

     WPSC will be billed $3.3 million in 1995 for their allocation of
     ANR's above-market costs of gas purchases from the Dakota
     Gasification Plant.  WPSC is protesting the legality of these
     costs which could total $49.0 million through 2009.

     NUCLEAR LIABILITY

     The Price-Anderson Act provides for the payment of funds for
     public liability claims arising out of a nuclear incident.  In
     the event of a nuclear incident involving any of the nation s
     licensed reactors, WPSC is subject to a proportional assessment
     which is approximately $32.7 million per incident, not to exceed
     $4.1 million per incident, per calendar year.  These amounts
     represent WPSC's 41.2% ownership share in Kewaunee.


                                    -52-
<PAGE>
     CLEAN AIR REGULATIONS

     In 1990, the Federal Clean Air Act Amendments ("Act") were signed
     into law.  The Act requires WPSC to meet new emission limits for
     sulfur dioxide and nitrogen oxide in 1995 (Phase I) and in the
     year 2000 (Phase II).  Since Wisconsin had already mandated
     reduced sulfur dioxide emissions by 1993, which were lower than
     the Federal levels mandated for 1995, WPSC was already working on
     lowering emissions.  WPSC has complied cost effectively with both
     the Federal and Wisconsin sulfur dioxide laws primarily through
     fuel-switching.  WPSC was in compliance with the Wisconsin sulfur
     dioxide limits and the Federal Phase II limits in 1994.  

     The final Federal regulations for nitrogen oxide are not known at
     this time; however, based on draft rules, WPSC expects to make
     additional capital expenditures in the range of $15 million to
     $25 million between 1995 and 1999 for Wisconsin and Federal air
     quality compliance.  Management believes that all costs incurred
     to comply with these laws will be recoverable in future customer
     rates.

     MANUFACTURED GAS PLANT REMEDIATION

     WPSC currently is investigating the need for environmental clean
     up of eight manufactured gas plant sites which it previously
     operated.  An environmental consultant has been engaged to
     develop cost estimates. These estimates are based upon an
     investigation of two of the sites and assumes excavation of
     impacted soils, thermal treatment of soils, on-site groundwater
     extraction and treatment and post-clean up and monitoring for
     twenty-five years.  The consultant has not yet performed detailed
     investigations of the remaining six sites and, therefore,
     comparable information on these sites is not available.  

     WPSC used the estimates for these two sites as a basis for making
     projections on cleanup costs at the other sites because of
     certain similar characteristics at the other sites.  Thus, for
     all sites, cleanup costs reflecting anticipated inflation,
     current technology and no change in regulatory requirements are
     estimated to be in the range of $14.8 million to $29.3 million. 
     Management has accrued $26.9 million for future cleanup costs for
     all eight sites which will be spent over the next thirty-four
     years.  However, as further investigations are performed on all
     sites, this estimate may change significantly.  

     The $26.9 million estimate has been recorded as a liability with
     an offsetting deferred charge (regulatory asset).  Based on a
     recent rate order, these costs (less any insurance recoveries)
     will be recoverable in future rates as expenditures are made.
     However, carrying costs are not recoverable.

     As additional site-specific studies are completed (three are
     anticipated in 1995), these estimates will be adjusted to reflect
     site-specific data. Other factors that can impact these estimates

                                    -53-
<PAGE>
     are the volume of contaminated soil, changes in remediation
     technology and regulatory requirements.  

     In June, the Wisconsin Supreme Court ("Court") issued a decision
     regarding recoveries from insurance companies for environmental
     remediation costs.  The Court held that insurance coverage was
     not available for environmental cleanup costs to the extent the
     clean up is done to prevent or mitigate future injury.  In
     addition, the Court held that a notification letter from a
     government agency about an environmental situation did not
     constitute a suit which triggers the insurers' duty to defend. 
     WPSC is exploring alternative approaches to pursuing claims
     against its carriers in light of the decision.

     WPSC has made minor payments for the investigation and potential
     clean up of certain other waste disposal sites.  Management
     believes WPSC has been a minor contributor to the total
     contamination at these sites and, accordingly, does not believe
     its share of cleanup costs to be material.

     LONG-TERM POWER SUPPLY 

     WPSC has signed a contract to build a 122-megawatt cogeneration
     facility with Rhinelander Paper Company and has filed an
     application for a Certificate of Public Convenience and Necessity
     with the PSCW requesting approval for the project.  Estimated
     cost for the project is $169 million. 

     Management estimates 1995 utility plant construction expenditures
     to be approximately $84.2 million.  DSM expenditures are
     estimated to be $25.8 million, of which approximately
     $15.0 million will be deferred and amortized over the next ten
     years consistent with rate recovery.

Because of various factors which affect the utility business, the quarterly results of operations are not necessarily
comparable.


(1)  In the quarter ended December 1993, WPSC recorded an adjustment as a result of its annual coal inventory
     observation.  This adjustment increased net income and earnings per average share of common stock by $1.2 million
     and $.05, respectively, for 1993.

                 F.  REPORT OF INDEPENDENT PUBLIC ACCOUNTANTS





To WPS Resources Corporation:

We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets and
consolidated statements of capitalization of WPS Resources Corporation
(a Wisconsin corporation) and subsidiaries as of December 31, 1994 and
1993, and the related consolidated statements of income and retained
earnings and cash flows for each of the three years in the period
ended December 31, 1994.  These financial statements are the
responsibility of the Company's management.  Our responsibility is to
express an opinion on these financial statements based on our audits.

We conducted our audits in accordance with generally accepted auditing
standards.  Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit
to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements
are free of material misstatement.  An audit includes examining, on a
test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the
financial statements.  An audit also includes assessing the accounting
principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well
as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation.  We
believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.

In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to
above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position
of WPS Resources Corporation and subsidiaries as of December 31, 1994
and 1993, and the results of their operations and their cash flows for
each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 1994 in
conformity with generally accepted accounting principles.

As discussed in notes (1)(l) and (1)(m) to the consolidated financial
statements, effective January 1, 1993, WPS Resources Corporation
changed its method of accounting for post-retirement benefits other
than pensions and income taxes.

                 A.  REPORT OF INDEPENDENT PUBLIC ACCOUNTANTS




To WPS Resources Corporation:


We have audited in accordance with generally accepted auditing
standards, the consolidated financial statements included in this
Form 10-K, and have issued our report thereon dated January 26, 1995. 
Our report on the consolidated financial statements includes an
explanatory paragraph with respect to the change in the methods of
accounting for income taxes and post-retirement benefits other than
pensions in 1993 as discussed in Notes 1(l) and 1(m) to the
consolidated financial statements.  Our audit was made for the purpose
of forming an opinion on those statements taken as a whole. 
Supplemental Schedule III is the responsibility of the Company s
management and is presented for purposes of complying with the
Securities and Exchange Commission's rules and is not part of the
basic consolidated financial statements.  This schedule has been
subjected to the auditing procedures applied in the audit of the basic
consolidated financial statements and, in our opinion, fairly states
in all material respects, the financial data required to be set forth
therein in relation to the basic consolidated financial statements
taken as a whole.

        Section 1.012.  Construction and Applicable Law.  (a)  Wherever
        -----------------------------------------------
any words are used in the masculine, they shall be construed as though
they were used in the feminine in all cases where they would so apply;
and wherever any words are use in the singular or the plural, they
shall be construed as though they were used in the plural or the
singular, as the case may be, in all cases where they would so apply. 
Titles of articles and sections are for general information only, and
the Plan is not to be construed by reference to such items.

        (b)  This Plan, as applied to Executives, is intended to be a
plan of deferred compensation maintained for a select group of

construed and its validity determined according to the laws of the

federal law.  In case any provision of the Plan is held illegal or

                                    -69-

        (b)  Reserve Account B 

        (c)  Stock Account 

        Section 1.022.  Reserve Account A.   (a)  This Account will be
        ---------------------------------

any  kind will be made to this Account on behalf of a Participant.

        (b)  As of the end of each Plan Year, the Account will be
credited with an interest equivalent on the balance in the Account
from time to time during the year.  The annual interest equivalent
will be the sum (on a non-compounded basis) of the attributed earnings
for each month during the year based on the Account balance as of the
last day of the month.  Unless modified by the Compensation Committee,
the interest equivalent rate for any month will be the greater of:

             (i)   one-half of one percent (0.5%); or

             (ii)  one-twelfth (1/12) of the return
                   on common shareholders' equity
                   (ROE).  For the months of April
                   through September, ROE means the
                   consolidated return on equity of
                   the Company and all subsidiaries
                   and affiliates for the twelve
                   (12) months ended on the
                   preceding March 31 as calculated
                   pursuant to the Company's
                   standard accounting procedure
                   for financial reporting to
                   shareholders.  For the months
                   October through March, ROE means
                   return on equity as described
                   above for the twelve (12) months

                   30.   

        (c)  The Compensation Committee may revise the interest
equivalent rate described in Section 2.02(b) above or the manner in
which it is calculated, but in no event shall the rate be less than
six percent (6%) per annum.  Any such revised rate shall be effective
with the calendar month following such action by the Compensation
Committee.

        (d)  Notwithstanding Section 2.02(b) and (c), in the event of
a Change in Control, the minimum rate of interest equivalent shall be
the greater of (A) six percent (6%) per annum, or (B) for each month
for which attributed earnings are required to be calculated, a rate


                                    -71-
<PAGE>
equal to two (2) percentage points above the prime lending rate at
Firstar Bank Milwaukee, Milwaukee, Wisconsin as of the last business
day of that month.

        Section 1.023.  Reserve Account B.  (a)   This Account shall be
        ---------------------------------
credited with Voluntary Deferrals made after December 31, 1995 which a
Participant elects to allocate to this Account or that are otherwise
allocated to this Account in accordance with Section 3.02(c)(ii).

        (b)  As of the end of each Plan Year, the Account will be
credited with an interest equivalent on the balance in the Account
from time to time during the year.  The annual interest equivalent
will be the sum (on a non-compounded basis) of the attributed earnings
for each month during the year based on the Account balance as of the
last day of each month.  Unless modified by the Compensation
Committee, the interest equivalent rate for any month will be the
greater of:

             (i)   one-half of one percent (0.5%); or

             (ii)  seventy percent (70%) of one-
                   twelfth (1/12) of the return on
                   common shareholders equity
                   (ROE).  For the months of April
                   through September, ROE means the
                   consolidated return on equity of
                   the Company and all subsidiaries
                   or affiliates for the twelve
                   (12) months ended on the
                   preceding March 31 as calculated
                   pursuant to the Company's
                   standard accounting procedure
                   for financial reporting to
                   shareholders.  For the months
                   October through March, ROE means
                   return on equity as described
                   above for the twelve (12) months
                   ended on the preceding September
                   30.   

        (c)  The Compensation Committee may revise the interest
equivalent rate described in Section 2.03(b) above or the manner in
which it is calculated, but in no event shall the rate be less than
six percent (6%) per annum.  Any such revised rate shall be effective
with the calendar month following such action by the Compensation
Committee.

        (d)  Notwithstanding Section 2.03(b) and (c), in the event of
a Change in Control, the minimum rate of interest equivalent shall be
the greater of (A) six percent (6%) per annum, or (B) for each month
for which attributed earnings are required to be calculated, a rate
equal to two (2) percentage points above the prime lending rate at
Firstar Bank Milwaukee, Milwaukee, Wisconsin as of the last business
day of that month.

        Section 1.024.  Stock Account.  (a)  This Account shall be
        -----------------------------
credited with all Mandatory Deferrals made after December 31, 1995 and
those Voluntary Deferrals made after December 31, 1995 which a


                                    -72-
<PAGE>
Participant, in accordance with Section 3.02(c)(ii), elects to
allocate to this Account.

        (b)  As of the end of each month, all Voluntary and Mandatory
Deferrals made by or on behalf of a Participant during that month and
allocated to the Participant's Stock Account (the "Convertible
Amount") shall be converted, for record-keeping purposes, into whole
and fractional WPS Resources Units, with fractional units calculated
to four decimal places.  The conversion shall be accomplished by
dividing each Participant's Convertible Amount by the average purchase
price of all shares of WPS Resources Stock purchased during that month
by or on behalf of the Trust and the WPS Resources Corporation
Dividend Reinvestment and Stock Purchase Plan.  Likewise, any
dividends that would have been payable on the WPS Resources Stock
Units credited to a Participant's Stock Account had such Units been
actual shares of WPS Resources Stock shall be converted, for record-
keeping purposes, into whole and fractional WPS Resources Stock Units
based on the average purchase price of all shares of WPS Resources
Stock purchased by or on behalf of the Trust and the WPS Resources
Corporation Dividend Reinvestment and Stock Purchase Plan during the
month in which the dividend is paid.
             
        Section 1.025.  Accounts are For Record-keeping Purposes Only. 
        -------------------------------------------------------------
The Plan Accounts described in this Article II above serve solely as a
device for determining the amount of benefits accumulated by a
Participant under the Plan, and shall not constitute or imply an
obligation on the part of the Company (or a subsidiary or affiliate
thereof) to fund such benefits.  In any event, the Company (or a
subsidiary or affiliate thereof) may, in its discretion, set aside
assets equal to part or all of such account balances and invest such
assets in Company stock, life insurance or any other investment deemed
appropriate.  Any such assets, including WPS Resources Stock and any
other assets held under the Trust, shall be and remain the sole
property of the Company (or a subsidiary or affiliate thereof) and
except to the extent that the Trust authorizes a Participant to
exercise voting rights with respect to WPS Resources Stock held in the
Trust, a Participant shall have no proprietary rights of any nature
whatsoever with respect to such assets.

        Section 1.031.  Mandatory Deferrals.  The Compensation
        ----------------------------------
Committee may, from time to time, authorize a Mandatory Deferral to be
made on behalf of covered Executives.  The authorization of any such
contribution, the Executives entitled to the contribution, and the
amount to be credited to each eligible Executive, shall be determined
by the Compensation Committee in its sole discretion; provided that
the maximum Mandatory Deferral for any year shall not exceed thirty
percent (30%) of an Executive's Compensation for the year.  Any
Mandatory Deferral will be credited to an eligible Executive's Stock
Account and converted into WPS Resources Stock Units in accordance
with Section 2.04.
                                       
        Section 1.032.  Election to Make Voluntary Deferrals.  (a)  A
        ---------------------------------------------------
Participant may elect to make Voluntary Deferrals by submitting a
properly completed and signed election form to the Secretary on or
before December 20, 1995.  If the Participant so elects, Voluntary
Deferrals will commence with respect to Compensation earned by a
Participant on or after January 1, 1996.  Notwithstanding the
foregoing, if, as of January 1, 1996, the Participant has in effect an
election under the prior deferred compensation program maintained by
Wisconsin Public Service Corporation and does not file an election
with the Secretary in accordance with this Section 3.02(a), the prior
election shall be deemed the Participant's initial election under this
Plan. 

        (b)  If a Director or Executive first becomes eligible to
participate in the Plan following the election period described in
Section 3.02(a) above (such as, for example, a Director who commences
service or an Executive who is newly designated by the Compensation
Committee as being eligible) the initial deferral election may be made
within thirty (30) days of the date that such person first becomes
eligible under the Plan, and shall be effective with respect to
Compensation earned by the Participant in the month following the
month during which the deferral election is made.  

        (c)  A Participant's election shall be in such form as the
Secretary may prescribe, and shall specify:

             (i)   The percentage or dollar amount
                   of Compensation to be deferred
                   as a Voluntary Deferral.  A
                   Director may elect to defer all
                   or any part of his Compensation,
                   in whole dollar amounts or in
                   increments of one percent (1%). 
                   An Executive may, without the
                   consent of the Compensation
                   Committee, elect to defer a
                   portion of his Compensation, in
                   whole dollar amounts or in
                   increments of one percent (1%),
                   provided that the amount or
                   percentage elected does not
                   exceed thirty percent (30%) of


                                    -74-
<PAGE>
                   the Executive's Compensation. 
                   An Executive may elect to defer
                   more than thirty percent (30%)
                   of Compensation only if the
                   Compensation Committee has
                   approved the Executive's
                   specific deferral percentage or
                   amount.

             (ii)  Whether the Voluntary Deferrals
                   are to be credited to the
                   Participant's Reserve Account
                   (Reserve Account B) or the
                   Participant's Stock Account.  If
                   the Participant desires to
                   allocate Voluntary Deferrals to
                   both his Reserve and Stock
                   Accounts, the election must
                   further specify the portion of
                   the Voluntary Deferrals, in
                   whole dollar amounts or in
                   increments of one percent (1%),
                   to be allocated to each Account. 
                   Notwithstanding anything to the
                   contrary herein, Voluntary
                   Deferrals in excess of thirty
                   percent (30%) of an Executive's
                   Compensation shall be credited
                   to Reserve Account B, and the
                   Executive's election under this
                   Section 3.02(c)(ii) shall not
                   apply to any such amounts.
        
        (d)  An election shall be deemed made only when it is received
by the Secretary, and shall remain in effect until modified by the
Participant in accordance with Section 3.03 below or otherwise revoked

                     RESERVE ACCOUNT B AND STOCK ACCOUNTS

        Section 1.041.  Distribution Election.  (a)  The distribution
        ------------------------------------
election (if any) made by a Participant under the Company's prior
deferred compensation program shall be his distribution election under
this Plan unless and until modified in accordance with Section 4.02
below.

        (b)  A new Participant shall, at the time he commences
participation in the Plan, make a distribution election with respect
to his Account.  The election shall be in such form as the Secretary
may prescribe, and shall specify:

             (i)   Unless the Participant has
                   selected a later commencement
                   date, distribution of a
                   Participant's Accounts will
                   commence within 60 days
                   following the end of the
                   calendar year in which occurs
                   the Participant's retirement or
                   termination of employment or
                   service.  For purposes of this
                   Plan, a participating Executive
                   who is disabled shall be deemed
                   to have retired or terminated at
                   the conclusion of benefits under
                   all disability income plans
                   sponsored by the Company or a
                   subsidiary or affiliate or to
                   which the Company or a
                   subsidiary or affiliate
                   contributes.  Further, a
                   participating Executive who
                   ceases employment with the
                   Company or a subsidiary or
                   affiliate in connection with an
                   early retirement (reduction in
                   force) program sponsored by the
                   Company or a subsidiary or
                   affiliate shall, if a
                   participant in the Wisconsin
                   Public Service Administrative
                   Employees Retirement Plan, be
                   deemed to have retired upon
                   commencement of retirement
                   benefits under such plan.

             (ii)  Distributions will be made in 3,
                   6, 9, 12 or 15 annual
                   installments, as elected by the
                   Participant.  

             (iii) In the event of the
                   Participant's death, the
                   Participant's remaining
                   undistributed interest will be
                   distributed to the Beneficiary
                   designated by the Participant in
                   either a single sum payment or
                   in installments, as elected by
                   the Participant.  If the
                   Participant has elected that


                                    -77-
<PAGE>
                   death benefits be paid in a
                   single sum, the payment shall be
                   made no later than March 1
                   following the calendar year in
                   which occurs the Participant's
                   death.  If the Participant has
                   elected that death benefits be
                   paid in installments, (A) any
                   installments previously
                   commenced to the Participant
                   shall continue to the
                   Beneficiary, and (B) if
                   installment distributions had
                   not commenced as of the date of
                   the Participant's death,
                   payments over the installment
                   period elected by the
                   Participant shall commence to
                   the Beneficiary no later than
                   March 1 following the calendar
                   year in which occurs the
                   Participant's death.

        (c)  A distribution election shall be deemed made only when it
is received by the Secretary, and shall remain in effect until
modified by the Participant in accordance with Section 4.02 below or
otherwise revoked in accordance with Plan rules.
  
        Section 1.042.  Modified Distribution Election.  A Participant
        ---------------------------------------------
may from time to time modify his distribution election by filing a
revised distribution election, properly completed and signed, with the
Secretary.  However, a revised distribution election will be given
effect only if the Participant remains employed by (or in the case of
a Director, continues service on the Board or the board of directors
of a subsidiary or affiliate) for twenty-four (24) consecutive months
following the date that the revised election is received by the
Secretary.

        Section 1.043.  Calculation of Annual Distribution Amount.  (a) 
        ---------------------------
For any Participant who commenced distributions prior to January 1,
1996 under the terms of the prior deferred compensation program
maintained by Wisconsin Public Service Corporation, distribution will
continue to be calculated under the distribution method applicable to
such Participant at the time his distributions commenced.

        (b)  For any Participant whose distribution commencement date
is after December 31, 1995, the annual distribution amount will be
determined by aggregating the Participant's interest in Reserve
Account A, Reserve Account B and the Stock Account and dividing this
sum by the number of installment payments remaining to be made under
the distribution period selected by the Participant.

             (i)   The Participant's interest in
                   Reserve Account A and Reserve
                   Account B for any distribution
                   year shall be the balance in
                   such accounts (if any) as of
                   January 1 of that year.

             (ii)  The Participant's interest in
                   the Stock Account for any
                   distribution year shall equal
                   the number of WPS Resources
                   Stock Units credited to such
                   account on January 1 of the year
                   in which the distribution is
                   being made (disregarding any
                   fractional units) multiplied by
                   the closing price of WPS
                   Resources Stock on January 21 of
                   that year as reported in the
                   Wall Street Journal's New York

                   Stock Exchange Composite
                   Transactions listing.  If
                   January 21 falls on a Saturday,
                   Sunday or holiday, the
                   calculation will be made on the
                   immediately preceding business
                   day.

        (c)  The amount of any distribution will be charged pro-rata 
against a Participant's Accounts.

        Section 1.044.  Form and Time of Distribution.   (a)  The
        ---------------------------------------------
portion of the annual distribution amount that is attributable to
Reserve Account A and/or Reserve Account B shall be distributed in
cash.  The portion of the annual distribution amount that is
attributable to the Stock Account shall be distributed in cash and/or
whole shares of WPS Resources Stock as determined by the Compensation
Committee in its sole discretion.  Subject to adjustment as provided
in paragraph (d) of this Section 4.04, the total number of authorized
but previously unissued shares of WPS Stock which may be distributed
to Participants pursuant to the Plan shall be one hundred thousand
(100,000), which number shall not be reduced by or as a result of
(i) any cash distributions pursuant to the Plan or (ii) the
distribution to Participants pursuant to the Plan of any outstanding
shares of WPS Stock purchased by or on behalf of the Trust.

        (b)  WPS Resources Stock distributed to a Participant shall be
distributed on January 22 (or if January 22 falls on a Saturday,
Sunday or holiday, the immediately following business day).  For
distribution and tax reporting purposes, the value of WPS Resources
Stock distributed shall equal the number of shares distributed
multiplied by the closing price of WPS Resources Stock on January 21
(or if January 21 falls on a Saturday, Sunday or holiday, the
immediately preceding business day) of the year in which the
distribution is being made as reported in the Wall Street Journal's
New York Stock Exchange Composite Transaction listing.  The cash
portion of any distribution will be made no later than March 1 of the
year for which the distribution is being made. 

        (c)  The amount actually distributed to the Participant will
be reduced by applicable income tax withholding.  Unless the
Participant has made a contrary election, income tax on the entire
annual distribution amount will be withheld from the cash portion of
the distribution, and WPS Resources Stock will be used to satisfy
withholding obligations only to the extent that the cash portion of
the distribution is insufficient for this purpose.  In the case of a
Participant who is subject to Section 16 of the Securities Exchange
Act of 1934, the Participant's election must be received by the
Secretary at least six (6) months prior to the date on which the WPS
Resources Stock is distributed.

        (d)  In the event of any merger, reorganization,
consolidation, recapitalization, separation, liquidation, stock
dividend, split-up, share combination or other change in the corporate
structure of the Company affecting WPS Stock, such adjustment shall be
made in the number and class of shares which may be distributed

pursuant to the Plan as may be determined to be appropriate and
equitable by the Compensation Committee in its sole discretion.

              ARTICLE V.  SPECIAL DEATH BENEFIT FOR PARTICIPANTS
            WHO DIE WHILE MAKING VOLUNTARY AND MANDATORY DEFERRALS

        Section 1.051.  Eligibility.  If an Executive who is employed
        ---------------------------
by Wisconsin Public Service Corporation at the Vice President level or
above (excluding Assistant Vice Presidents) dies prior to attainment
of age sixty-five (65) and while employed by Wisconsin Public Service
Corporation, and if at the time of the Executive's death Voluntary or
Mandatory Deferrals were being made by or on behalf of the Executive,
then a special death benefit shall be paid to the Executive's
Beneficiary.  This special death benefit is in addition to any other
death benefit payable under the Plan.  

        Section 1.052.  Calculation of Special Death Benefit Amount. 
        -----------------------------------------------------------
The special death benefit shall be an amount equal to the sum of the
(a), (b), (c) and (d) below.

        (a)  The difference between (i) the amount of Voluntary and
Mandatory Deferrals that would have been made by or on behalf of the
Executive during the month in which occurs the Executive's death,
assuming, for this purpose that the Participant had lived, and
(ii) the amount of Voluntary and Mandatory Deferrals actually made
during such month;

        (b)  The product obtained by multiplying (i) the amount of
Voluntary and Mandatory Deferrals made by or on behalf of the
Executive during the month prior to the month in which occurs the
Executive's death, and (ii) the number of full calendar months,
inclusive, from the month following the month in which occurs the
Executive's death to the month preceding the month in which the
Executive would have attained age sixty-five (65) had he lived; 

        (c)  In the event the Executive's birthday is other than the
first day of a calendar month, for the month in which the Executive
would have attained age sixty-five (65), the product obtained by
multiplying (i) the amount of Voluntary and Mandatory Deferrals made
by or on behalf of the Executive during the month prior to the month
in which occurs the Executive's death, and (ii) a fraction, the
numerator of which is the number of days in such month prior to the
Executive's sixty-fifth (65th) birthday and the denominator of which
is the total number of days in the month;

        (d)  A projected earnings factor equal to the amount of
interest equivalent that would have accumulated on the amounts
described in (a), (b) and (c) above.  The projected earnings factor
shall be calculated using the interest equivalent rate that was in
effect under Reserve Account B for the month prior to the month in
which occurs the Executive's death   The calculation shall assume that
the Voluntary and Mandatory Deferrals described in (a), (b) and (c)
above were credited to Reserve Account B on a monthly basis assuming
that the Executive had lived and continued to make Voluntary and
Mandatory Deferrals.  The interest equivalent shall be compounded in
the same manner as the Executive's actual Reserve Account balance,
i.e., the annual interest equivalent, calculated as of the end of each
- ---

attributed earnings for each month during the year based on the
Account balance as of the last day of the month.

        Section 5.03.  Payment of Special Death Benefit.  (a)  The
        -----------------------------------------------
special death benefit calculated in accordance with Section 5.02 above
shall be paid to the Executive's Beneficiary in fifteen (15) annual
installments, with the first installment commencing within sixty (60)
days of the Executive's death.  The benefit calculated under Section
5.02 is a fixed amount which does not accrue earnings or interest
equivalent on the undistributed balance.

in the case of an Executive employed at the Senior Vice President
level or above, and ten percent (10%) in the case of an Executive
employed at the Vice President level.

        (c)  The Executive's "average monthly compensation" is the
Executive's "compensation", expressed on a monthly basis, during
whichever period of thirty-six (36) consecutive months of employment
produces the highest average.  For this purpose, "compensation" shall
have the same meaning as under the Wisconsin Public Service
Corporation Administrative Employees' Retirement Plan with the

with the assistance of the Secretary,  shall administer and interpret
the Plan and supervise preparation of Participant elections, forms,

final and binding upon each Participant and Beneficiary.  The
Compensation Committee, and the Secretary with respect to matters
assigned to him under this Plan or delegated to him by the
Compensation Committee, may adopt and modify rules and regulations
relating to the Plan as it deems necessary or advisable for the
administration of the Plan.  If the Secretary shall also be a
Participant or Beneficiary, any determinations affecting the
Secretary's participation in the Plan shall be made by the
Compensation Committee. 

        Section 1.092.  Compliance With Securities Exchange Act. 
        -------------------------------------------------------
Transactions under the Plan are intended to comply with all applicable
conditions of Rule 16b-3 or its successor under the Securities
Exchange Act of 1934.  The Plan shall be construed by the Compensation
Committee so that transactions under the Plan will be exempt from
Section 16 of the Exchange Act pursuant to regulations and
interpretations issued from time to time by the Securities and
Exchange Commission.

        Section 1.093.  Participant Rights Unsecured.  (a)  The right
        ---------------------------------------------
of a Participant or his Beneficiary to receive a distribution
hereunder shall be an unsecured claim, and neither the Participant nor
any Beneficiary shall have any rights in or against any amount
credited to his Account or any other specific assets of the Company or
any subsidiary or affiliate thereof.  The right of a Participant or
Beneficiary to the payment of benefits under this Plan shall not be
assigned, encumbered, or transferred, except by will or the laws of
descent and distribution.  The rights of a Participant hereunder are
exercisable during the Participant's lifetime only by him or his
guardian or legal representative.

        (b)  The Company may authorize the creation of a trust or
other arrangements to assist the Company in meeting the obligations
created under the Plan.  However, any liability to any person with
respect to the Plan shall be based solely upon any contractual
obligations that may be created pursuant to the Plan.  No obligation
of the Company or any subsidiary or affiliate thereof shall be deemed
to be secured by any pledge of, or other encumbrance on, any property
of the Company or any subsidiary or affiliate thereof.  Nothing
contained in this Plan and no action taken pursuant to its terms shall
create or be construed to create a trust of any kind, or a fiduciary
relationship between the Company or a subsidiary or affiliate thereof
and any Participant or Beneficiary, or any other person.  

        Section 1.094.  Income Tax Withholding.  Subject to Section

Company (or a subsidiary or affiliate) regarding the payment of, any
Federal, state, local or foreign taxes of any kind required by law to
be withheld with respect to such amount.

        Section 1.095.  Establishment, Amendment or Termination of
        ----------------------------------------------------------

the Company's stockholders at which a quorum representing a majority
of all outstanding voting stock is, either in person or by proxy,
present and voting on the Plan.

        (b)  There shall be no time limit on the duration of the Plan. 
The Board may, at any time, amend or terminate the Plan without the
consent of the Participants or Beneficiaries, provided, however, that
no amendment or termination may reduce any Account balance accrued on
behalf of a Participant based on deferrals already made, or divest any
Participant of rights to which he would have been entitled if the Plan
had been terminated immediately prior to the effective date of such
amendment.  This Section shall not, however, restrict the right of the
Board to cause all Accounts to be distributed in the event of Plan
termination.  In addition, no amendment may become effective until
stockholder approval is obtained if the amendment as it relates to
Participants subject to Section 16 of the Exchange Act would require
shareholder approval under Rule 16b-3 or any successor provision.

        Section 1.096.  Administrative Expenses.  Costs of establishing
        ---------------------------------------
and administering the Plan will be paid by the Company or its

considered compensation for welfare benefit plans, such as life and
disability insurance programs sponsored by the Company.  

        Section 1.098.  Successor and Assigns.  This Plan shall be
        --------------------------------------
binding upon and inure to the benefit of the Company and its
