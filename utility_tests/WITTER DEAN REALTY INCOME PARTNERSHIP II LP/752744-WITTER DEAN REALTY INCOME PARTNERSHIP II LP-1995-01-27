                                             PART I.

ITEM 1.   BUSINESS.

        The Registrant, Dean Witter Realty Income Partnership II, L.P. (the
"Partnership"), is a limited partnership formed in September 1984 under
the Uniform Limited Partnership Act of the State of Delaware for the
purpose of investing primarily in income-producing office, industrial and
retail properties.

        The Managing General Partner of the Partnership is Dean Witter
Realty Income Properties II Inc. (the "Managing General Partner"), a
Delaware corporation which is wholly-owned by Dean Witter Realty Inc. 
The Associate General Partner is Dean Witter Realty Income Associates II,
L.P. (the "Associate General Partner"), a Delaware limited partnership,
the general partner of which is Dean Witter Realty Income Associates II
Inc., a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Managing General Partner.  The
Managing General Partner manages and controls all aspects of the business
of the Partnership.  The terms of transactions between the Partnership
and its affiliates are set forth in Item 13 below.

        The Partnership issued 177,023 units of limited partnership interest
(the "Units") with gross proceeds from the offering of $177,023,000.  The
offering has been terminated and no additional Units will be sold.

         The proceeds from the offering were used to make equity investments
in six office properties and three retail properties (one of which was
sold in fiscal 1993) which were acquired without permanent mortgage debt. 
The properties are described in Item 2 below.

        The Partnership considers its business to include one industry
segment, investment in real property.

        The Partnership's real property investments are subject to
competition from similar types of properties in the vicinities in which
they are located.  In recent years, an oversupply condition has persisted
nationally and many markets have experienced high vacancy rates. 
Currently, many real estate markets are beginning to stabilize primarily
due to the continued absence of significant construction activity;
however, the recovery is expected to be slow.  Further information
regarding competition in the markets where the Partnership's properties
are located is set forth in Item 7.  "Management's Discussion and
Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations".

        The Partnership has no employees.

        All of the Partnership's business is conducted in the United States.

ITEM 2.     PROPERTIES

         The Partnership owns directly or through a partnership interest,
the following eight property interests.  Generally, the leases pertaining
to the properties provide for pass-throughs to the tenants of their
pro-rata share of certain operating expenses.

       Further information relating to the Partnership's properties is
included in Item 7 and footnotes 4, 5 and 6 to the consolidated financial
statements included in Item 8 below.

ITEM 3.      LEGAL PROCEEDINGS.
       Neither the Partnership nor any of its properties are subject to any
material pending legal proceedings.

ITEM 4.      SUBMISSION OF MATTERS TO A VOTE OF SECURITY HOLDERS.

       No matter was submitted during the fourth quarter of the fiscal year
to a vote of Unit holders.

                                            PART II.

ITEM 5.   MARKET FOR THE REGISTRANT'S COMMON EQUITY AND RELATED        
          STOCKHOLDER MATTERS.

       An established public trading market for the Units does not exist,
and it is not anticipated that such a market will develop in the future. 
Accordingly, information as to the market value of a Unit at any given
date is not available.  However, the Partnership does allow its limited
partners (the "Limited Partners") to transfer their units if a suitable
buyer can be located.

       As of October 31, 1994, there were 28,015 holders of limited
partnership interests.

       The Partnership is a limited partnership and, accordingly, does not
pay dividends.  It does, however, make quarterly distributions of cash
to its partners.  Pursuant to the partnership agreement, distributable
cash, as defined, is paid 90% to the Limited Partners and 10% to the
general partners (the "General Partners").  

       The Partnership paid quarterly cash distributions during the year
ended October 31, 1994 aggregating $30.00 per Unit to Limited Partners. 
The total distribution amounted to $5,900,766, with $5,310,690
distributed to the Limited Partners and $590,076 distributed to the
General Partners.  Additionally, in fiscal 1994, the Partnership repaid
$928,139 of deferred distributions owed to the General Partners.

       On November 29, 1994, the Partnership paid a cash distribution of
$10.00 per Unit to the Limited Partners.  The cash distribution
aggregated $1,966,922 with $1,770,230 distributed to the Limited Partners
and $196,692 distributed to the General Partners.  The Partnership also
repaid $928,139 of deferred distributions owed to the General Partners. 

       The Partnership anticipates making regular distributions to its
partners in the future.

       Sale or financing proceeds will be distributed, to the extent
available, first, to each Limited Partner, until there has been a return
of the Limited Partner's capital contribution plus cumulative
distributions of distributable cash and sale or refinancing proceeds in
an amount sufficient to provide a 9% cumulative annual return on the
Limited Partner's adjusted capital contribution.  Thereafter, any
remaining sale or financing proceeds will be distributed 85% to the
Limited Partners and 15% to the General Partners after the Managing
General Partner receives a brokerage fee of up to 3% of the selling price
of any equity investment.

       Taxable income generally is allocated in the same proportions as
distributions of distributable cash or sale or financing proceeds.  In
the event there is no distributable cash or sale or financing proceeds,
taxable income is allocated 90% to the Limited Partners and 10% to the
General Partners.  Any tax loss will be allocated 90% to the Limited
Partners and 10% to the General Partners.

ITEM 7.      MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND
             RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.

        Liquidity and Capital Resources

        The Partnership raised $177,023,000 in a public offering which was
terminated in 1985.  The Partnership has no plans to raise additional
capital.

        The Partnership has purchased six properties (one of which was sold
in May 1993) and made three investments in partnerships on an all-cash
basis.  The Partnership's acquisition program has been completed.  No
additional investments are planned.


        Many real estate markets are stabilizing, primarily due to the
continued absence of significant construction activity.  However, the
recovery of office properties will be slow because tenant demand is weak
as a result of continued downsizing by many major corporations. 
Increased consumer spending has helped the retail property market
although increased interest rates have slowed spending recently.  Most
geographic regions of the country are improving, with the exception of
Southern California, where the impact of the defense industry reductions
has not been offset by growth in other industries.

        Real estate markets are generally divided into sub-markets by
geographic location and property type.  Not all sub-markets have been
affected equally by the above factors.

        The Partnership's liquidity depends on the cash flow from operations
of its properties, expenditures for tenant improvements and leasing
commissions in connection with the leasing of vacant space.  In 1994, all
of the Partnership's properties generated positive cash flow from
operations, and it is anticipated that they will continue to do so.            

        In 1994, the Partnership's cash flow from operations and
distributions received from its joint venture investment exceeded
distributions to partners, its joint venture investment, and capital
expenditures.  The high occupancy level and limited turnover of leases
at the properties in the portfolio has resulted in an increase in the
Partnership's cash reserves through October 31, 1994.  Consequently, in
1994 the Partnership increased the Limited Partners' distribution rate
from 2% to 4% per Unit.  In 1995, the Partnership expects that cash flows
from operations and distributions received from its joint venture
investment will exceed distributions to partners at the 4% per Unit rate. 
However, the excess will not be sufficient to fully fund certain capital
improvements; these will be funded from Partnership cash reserves. 
Additionally, through November 1994, the Partnership has repaid
$1,856,278 of the deferred distributions owed to the General Partners. 
The Partnership expects to repay the remaining $1,856,278 of deferred
distributions in fiscal 1995.

        In 1994, the Partnership incurred approximately $2,367,000 of tenant
and building improvements, including approximately $1,091,000 at
Glenhardie Corporate Center and approximately $755,000 at United Services
Life Building.

        Subsequent to year-end, the lease term of Countrywide Credit, the
largest tenant at the Century Square office building, was extended from
March 2000 to March 2010.  The rental rate will remain constant over the
next five years rather than increasing, as provided for under the
original leases. 

        In fiscal 1993, the Partnership concluded that there was a decline
in the value of the Taxter Corporate Park property, and that the decline
was other-than-temporary.  Accordingly, the general partners of the
partnership which owns the property recorded a loss on impairment of its
investment in the property of approximately $27.8 million at October 31,
1993.  The Partnership's share of this loss, which was included in equity
in earnings (loss) of joint ventures was approximately $4.1 million. 

        In February 1992, the Partnership established a $5,000,000 line of
credit with a bank.  Borrowings bore interest payable monthly, at prime
plus three quarters percent.  In June 1993, the loan balance of
$4,250,035 was repaid in full from proceeds from the sale of the Sardis
Crossing retail property.

        On November 29, 1994, the Partnership paid a cash distribution of
$10.00 per Unit to the Limited Partners.  The cash distribution
aggregated $1,966,922 with $1,770,230 distributed to the Limited Partners
and $196,692 distributed to the General Partners.   

        Operations

        Fluctuations in the Partnership's operating results for the year
ended October 31, 1994 compared to 1993 and for the year ended October
31, 1993 compared to 1992 are primarily attributable to the following:

        The decrease in rental income in 1994 as compared to 1993 is
primarily due to the sale of the Sardis Crossing property in May 1993 and
lower rents recognized at Glenhardie Corporate Center I and Wallkill
Plaza in 1994, offset by higher rental income at the United Services Life
Building and the Framingham Corporate Center.  The increase in rental
income in 1993 as compared to 1992 is primarily due to increased rents
recognized at Century Square and Pavilions at East Lake in 1993,
partially offset by the loss of rental income from the sale of the Sardis
Crossing property. 
        
        The increase in equity in earnings (loss) of joint venture in 1994
compared to 1993 and the decrease in equity in earnings (loss) of joint
venture in 1993 compared to 1992 are due primarily to the Partnership's
share of the writedown for other than temporary impairment in value of
Taxter Corporate Park of approximately $4.1 million in the fourth quarter
of 1993.  The decrease in equity in earnings (loss) of joint venture in
1993 compared to 1992 was partially offset by a real estate tax refund
recognized at Taxter Corporate Park in the fourth quarter of 1993.  

        The increase in interest and other income in 1993 compared to 1992
is primarily due to the receipt of lease cancellation income totaling
$289,000 at the Glenhardie Corporate Center and the United Services Life
Building in 1993. 

        The decrease in property operating expenses in 1994 compared to 1993
is primarily attributable to lower utility and repair and maintenance
expenses at the Glenhardie office buildings in 1994 and the sale of the
Sardis Crossing property in 1993, partially offset by increased legal
fees incurred in connection with the lawsuit against a construction
contractor at the Century Square office building.  The increase in
property operating expenses in 1993 compared to 1992 is primarily
attributable to increased costs relating to higher average occupancies
at United Services Life and Pavilions at East Lake properties in 1993,
and legal fees incurred in 1993 at Century Square. 

        The increase in depreciation in 1994 compared to 1993 corresponds
to increased expenditures for tenant improvements in 1994. 

        The decrease in amortization in 1994 compared to 1993 is due to a
substantial portion of leasing commissions becoming fully amortized in
1993 at the United Services Life and Pavilions at East Lake properties,
and the sale of the Sardis Crossing property.  These decreases are
partially offset by amortization on leasing commissions incurred
primarily at the United Services Life Building, Glenhardie Corporate
Center and Pavilions at East Lake in fiscal 1993 and 1994.  The increase
in amortization in 1993 compared to 1992 is primarily due to increased
expenditures for leasing commissions at Framingham Corporate Center and
the United Services Life building in 1992, and the Glenhardie Corporate
Center and the United Services Life building in 1993.

        The decreases in interest expense in 1994 compared to 1993 and 1993
compared to 1992 is due to the repayment of the bank loan in June 1993.
The decrease in interest expense in 1993 compared to 1992 is also due to
a decrease in the effective interest rate on the Partnership's debt
during 1993.  

        A summary of the markets in which the Partnership's office
properties are located and the performance of each property is as
follows:  

        The Boston suburban office market, the location of the Framingham
Corporate Center, is one of the most active markets in the Boston area. 
The current market vacancy rate is approximately 6%.  As of October 31,
1994, the building was 99% leased to 13 tenants.  Major tenants include
ASB Meditest and Blue Cross/Blue Shield, both of whose leases expire in
1996.

        The office market in Westchester County, New York, the location of
Taxter Corporate Park, has experienced a significant decline.  The
current vacancy level in the Westchester office market is approximately
25% as many major tenants in the market are consolidating their
operations.  It is unlikely that this vacant space will be absorbed in
this market for several years.  However, as of October 31, 1994, the
property was 98% leased to 26 tenants.  One of the tenants acquired a
long-term leasehold interest in approximately 20% of the space at the
property in 1988.  This tenant does not pay rent, but is responsible for
its share of real estate taxes and certain operating expenses.  The lease
of Fuji Photo Film, the other major tenant (covering 21% of the
property's space) expires in 1996.  

        Glenhardie Corporate Center I and II are located in the mid-range
office building market in Valley Forge, Pennsylvania where the vacancy
rate is approximately 14%.  As of October 31, 1994, the buildings were
98% leased to 11 tenants.  Major tenants include Sun Guard Data
Corporation and Users Inc, whose leases expire in 1998 and 1999,
respectively.

        In Pasadena, California, the location of the Century Square office
building, the office market overall vacancy rate is approximately 16%,
and it is expected to face some deterioration in the near term as a
result of downsizing by two large employers in that market.  However,
Century Square remained 100% leased during the year.  The occupancy of
the property's largest tenant, Countrywide Credit, remained at
approximately 83%.  

        The office market at Bellevue, Washington, the location of the
United Services Life Building, has experienced minimal space absorption
in 1994, primarily as a result of a slowdown in the local economy and the
availability of sub-lease space.  As of October 31, 1994, the building
was 98% leased to 30 tenants.  Major tenants include, Asymetrix
Corporation and United Service Life. Asymetrix Corporation's leases
expire in 1996 and 1998 and United Services Life's lease expires in 1995.

        A summary of the markets in which the Partnership's retail
properties are located and the leasing status of each property are as
follows:

        Pavilions at East Lake is located in an area of suburban Atlanta,
a market which experienced significant retail development in the 1980's. 
Retail occupancy in the area eroded during the recession.  Additionally,
a new shopping center recently opened which directly competes with the
property.  Increased vacancies and downward pressure on rents are
expected to continue in the near term.  As of October 31, 1994, the
center was 91% leased to 35 tenants.  In the third quarter of 1994, A&P,
the anchor tenant vacated its space.  However, A&P is obligated to
continue to pay rent until its lease expires in 2006.  A&P is actively
seeking a replacement tenant.

        Wallkill Plaza, located in Wallkill, New York, has been affected by
both the recession and new retail development.  A regional mall opened
in the area in mid-1992.  As a result, rental levels, which have already
experienced a decline, may experience further downward pressure.  As of
October 31, 1994, the center was 86% leased to 18 tenants.  Anchor
tenants include Bradlees and Shop Rite, both of whose leases expire in
2006.

        Inflation

        Inflation has been consistently low during the periods presented in
the financial statements and, as a result, has not had a significant
effect on the operations of the Partnership or its properties.

Independent Auditors' Report





To The Partners of
Dean Witter Realty Income Partnership II, L.P.:


We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Dean
Witter Realty Income Partnership II, L.P. and consolidated partnerships
(the "Partnership") as of October 31, 1994 and 1993, and the related
consolidated statements of income, partners' capital, and cash flows
for each of the three years in the period ended October 31, 1994.  Our
audits also included the financial statement schedules listed in the
index at Item 8.  These financial statements and financial statement
schedules are the responsibility of the Partnerships' management.  Our
responsibility is to express an opinion on the financial statements and
financial statement schedules based on our audits.

We conducted our audits in accordance with generally accepted auditing
standards.  Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit
to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements
are free of material misstatement.  An audit includes examining, on a
test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the
financial statements.  An audit also includes assessing the accounting
principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well
as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation.  We believe
that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.

In our opinion, such financial statements present fairly in all
material respects, the financial position of Dean Witter Realty Income
Partnership II, L.P. and consolidated partnerships as of October 31,
1994 and 1993, and the results of their operations and their cash flows
for each of the three years in the period ended October 31, 1994 in
conformity with generally accepted accounting principles.  Also in our
opinion, such financial statement schedules, when considered in
relation to the basic consolidated financial statements taken as a
whole, present fairly in all material respects, the information set
forth therein.

                       DEAN WITTER REALTY INCOME PARTNERSHIP II, L.P.

                         NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

                               October 31, 1994, 1993 and 1992



1.   The Partnership

Dean Witter Realty Income Partnership II, L.P. (the "Partnership") is
a limited partnership organized under the laws of the State of Delaware
in 1984.  The Partnership is managed by Dean Witter Realty Income
Properties II Inc. (the "Managing General Partner").  The Partnership's
fiscal year ends on October 31.

In 1985, the Partnership issued 177,023 units of limited partnership
interest (the "Units") for $177,023,000.  No additional Units will be
sold.  The proceeds of the offering were used to make equity
investments in income-producing office and retail properties which were
not encumbered by debt when acquired.


2.   Summary of Significant Accounting Policies

The financial statements include the accounts of the Partnership and
the Century Square and Framingham Corporate Center joint ventures on
a consolidated basis.  The equity method of accounting has been applied
to the Partnership's 14.8% interest in the Taxter Corporate Park
property because of its continuing ability to exert significant
influence.

The Partnership owns a 75% general partnership interest in Century
Square.  An affiliate of the partnership, Dean Witter Realty Income
Partnership I, L.P., owns the remaining 25% general partnership
interest.

The Partnership's records are maintained on the accrual basis of
accounting for financial reporting and tax purposes.

The carrying value of real estate includes the purchase price paid by
the Partnership and acquisition fees and expenses.  Costs of
improvements to the properties are capitalized, and repairs are
expensed.  Depreciation is recorded on the straight-line method.

The Partnership periodically evaluates the recoverability of the net
carrying value of its real estate.  The evaluation is based on a review
of expected future cash flows, determination of the Partnership's
expected holding period of these assets and other factors.  

Deferred expenses consist primarily of leasing commissions which are
amortized over the applicable lease terms.

Rental income is recognized on a straight-line basis.

The Partnership considers short-term investments with original
maturities of three months or less to be cash equivalents.

Net income per Unit amounts are calculated by dividing net income
allocated to Limited Partners, in accordance with the Partnership
Agreement, by the weighted average number of Units outstanding.

No provision for income taxes has been made in the financial
statements, since the liability for such taxes is that of the partners
rather than the Partnership.

For income tax purposes, Partnership results are reported for the
calendar year.  The accounting policies used for tax reporting purposes
differ from those used for financial reporting as follows: (a)
depreciation is calculated using accelerated methods, (b) rental income
is recognized based on the payment terms in the applicable leases, and
(c) writedowns for impairment of real estate are not deductible.  In
addition, offering costs are treated differently for tax and financial
reporting purposes.  The tax basis of the Partnership's assets and
liabilities is approximately $5.2 million higher than the amounts
reported for financial statement purposes.


3.   Partnership Agreement

The Partnership Agreement provides that distributable cash, as defined,
is paid 90% to the Limited Partners and 10% to the General Partners. 

Sale or financing proceeds will be distributed, to the extent
available, first, to each Limited Partner, until return of the Limited
Partner's capital contribution plus cumulative distributions of
distributable cash and sale or financing proceeds in an amount
sufficient to provide a 9% cumulative annual return on the Limited
Partner's adjusted capital contribution.  Thereafter, any remaining
sale or financing proceeds will be distributed 85% to the Limited
Partners and 15% to the General Partners after the Managing General
Partner receives a brokerage fee of up to 3% of the selling price of
any equity investment.       

Taxable income generally is allocated in the same proportions as
distributions of distributable cash or sale or financing proceeds.  In
the event there is no distributable cash or sale or financing proceeds,
taxable income is allocated 90% to the Limited Partners and 10% to the
General Partners.  Any tax loss is allocated 90% to the Limited
Partners and 10% to the General Partners.

</TABLE>

In fiscal 1994, the Century Square joint venture settled a lawsuit with
the developer of the property relating to certain defects in the
parking structure and heating, ventilation and air conditioning
systems.  Pursuant to the settlement, the joint venture received
$835,000 in 1994.  The proceeds were distributed to the co-venturers
according to their interests; accordingly, the Partnership received
$626,250.  The joint venture will receive an additional $100,000 in
each of fiscal years 1995 and 1996.  The Partnership recorded the
proceeds, which represent the recovery of costs incurred and
capitalized to correct the defects, as a reduction of buildings and
improvements.  

5.  Sale of Real Estate

In May 1993, the Partnership sold the Sardis Crossing property for
$6,450,000, less closing costs.  The net carrying value of the
property, including deferred costs, was approximately $5,585,000 at the
time of sale. $4,250,035 of the proceeds were used to repay the
Partnership's bank loan, and the remainder was distributed to the
Limited Partners.   The gain on the sale ($4.49 per limited partnership
Unit) was allocated 100% to the Limited Partners in accordance with the
Partnership Agreement.

6.  Investment in Joint Venture

Taxter Corporate Park, Westchester County, New York

In 1986, the Partnership purchased a 14.8% general partnership interest
in the partnership which owns the property.  Affiliates of the
Partnership, Dean Witter Realty Income Partnership III, L.P. and Dean
Witter Realty Income Partnership IV, L.P. purchased the remaining 44.6%
and 40.6% general partnership interests, respectively.

The partners receive cash flow and profits and losses according to
their pro rata shares. 

In fiscal 1993, because of continuing weakness in the Westchester
County, New York office market, and the likelihood that such weakness
would persist for several years, the general partners of the
partnership which owns the property concluded that there was a decline
in its value, and that the decline was other-than-temporary. 
Accordingly, the partnership which owns the property recorded a loss
on impairment of the property of approximately $27.8 million at October
31, 1993.  The Partnership's share of this loss, approximately $4.1
million, was included in equity in earnings (loss) of joint venture in
1993. 

Summarized balance sheet information of the joint venture are as
follows:

     7.     Loan Payable to Bank

     In February 1992, the Partnership established a secured revolving credit
     facility in the amount of $5,000,000 with a bank.  Borrowings bore 
     interest, payable monthly, at the prime rate plus three quarters percent.  
     In June 1993, the loan balance of $4,250,035 was repaid in full. 

     8.  Leases

     Minimum future rental income under noncancellable operating leases as of
     October 31, 1994 is as follows:

                  Year ending October 31:
                  1995                                            $15,656,528
                  1996                                             14,681,254
                  1997                                             11,781,813
                  1998                                             10,302,417
                  1999                                              8,014,883
                  Thereafter                                       20,533,720

                  Total                                           $80,970,615

     The Partnership has determined that all leases relating to its properties
     are operating leases.  The lease terms range from three to fifteen years,
     and generally provide for fixed minimum rents with rental escalation and/or
     expense reimbursement clauses.

     Subsequent to year-end, the lease term of Countrywide Credit, the largest
     tenant at the Century Square office building, was extended from March 2000
     to March 2010.  The rental rate will remain constant over the next five
     years rather than increasing, as provided for under the original leases. 

9.  Related Party Transactions

An affiliate of the Managing General Partner provided property
management services for four properties in 1994, six properties in 1993
and five properties in 1992.  The Partnership paid the affiliate
management fees of approximately $295,000, $321,000 and $291,000 for
the years ended October 31, 1994, 1993 and 1992, respectively.

Another affiliate of the Managing General Partner performs
administrative functions and processes certain investor and tax
information on behalf of the Partnership.  For the years ended October
31, 1994, 1993 and 1992, the affiliate was reimbursed approximately
$523,000, $527,000 and $530,000, respectively, for these services.  As
of October 31, 1994, the affiliate was owed approximately $163,000 for
these services.

The Partnership had borrowed funds from an affiliate of the Managing
General Partner.  Interest expense, which was calculated at the prime
rate, approximated $297,000 in 1992.  The loan was repaid in full in
fiscal 1992.

Through October 31, 1994 and 1993, the General Partners have deferred
receipt of an aggregate amount of $2,784,417 and $3,712,556,
respectively, of distributions to which they are entitled, including
distributions of approximately $148,000 and $295,000 in 1993 and 1992,
respectively.  Amounts deferred were charged against partners'  capital
and recorded as liabilities owing to the General Partners.  In fiscal
1994, the Partnership repaid $928,139 of deferred distributions owed
to the General Partners.


10.  Subsequent Event

On November 29, 1994, the Partnership paid a cash distribution of
$10.00 per Unit to the Limited Partners.  The cash distribution
aggregated $1,966,922 with $1,770,230 distributed to the Limited
Partners and $196,692 distributed to the General Partners.  The
Partnership also repaid $928,139 of deferred distributions owed to the
General Partners.  The Partnership expects to repay this liability in
full in fiscal 1995. <PAGE>
