ITEM 1.   BUSINESS.

        The Registrant, Dean Witter Realty Income Partnership II, L.P. (the
"Partnership"), is a limited partnership formed in September 1984 under
the Uniform Limited Partnership Act of the State of Delaware for the
purpose of investing primarily in income-producing office, industrial and
retail properties.

        The Managing General Partner of the Partnership is Dean Witter
Realty Income Properties II Inc. (the "Managing General Partner"), a
Delaware corporation which is wholly-owned by Dean Witter Realty Inc.
("Realty").  The Associate General Partner is Dean Witter Realty Income
Associates II, L.P. (the "Associate General Partner"), a Delaware limited
partnership, the general partner of which is Dean Witter Realty Income
Associates II Inc., a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Managing General
Partner.  The Managing General Partner manages and controls all aspects
of the business of the Partnership.  The terms of transactions between
the Partnership and its affiliates are set forth in Item 13 below.

        The Partnership issued 177,023 units of limited partnership interest
(the "Units") with gross proceeds from the offering of $177,023,000.  The
offering has been terminated and no additional Units will be sold.

         The proceeds from the offering were used to make equity investments
in six office properties and three retail properties (one of which was
sold in May 1993, and one sold subsequent to fiscal year end) which were
acquired without mortgage debt.  The properties are described in Item 2
below.

        The Partnership considers its business to include one industry
segment, investment in real property.  Financial information regarding
the Partnership is in the Partnership's financial statements in Item 8
below.

        The Partnership's real property investments are subject to
competition from similar types of properties in the vicinities in which
they are located.  Further information regarding competition and market
conditions where the Partnership's properties are located is set forth
in Item 7.  "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition
and Results of Operations".

        The Partnership has no employees.

        All of the Partnership's business is conducted in the United States.

ITEM 2.     PROPERTIES

        The Partnership's principal offices are located at Two World Trade
Center, New York, New York 10048.  The Partnership has no other offices.

         The Partnership owns directly or through a partnership interest
the following eight property interests, none of which is encumbered by
mortgage debt.  Generally, the leases pertaining to the properties
provide for pass-throughs to the tenants of their pro-rata share of
certain operating expenses.  In the opinion of the Managing General
Partner, all of the properties are adequately covered by insurance.

ITEM 3.      LEGAL PROCEEDINGS.

       On December 27, 1995, a class action lawsuit naming various public
real estate partnerships sponsored by Realty (including the Partnership
and its Managing General Partner and Associate General Partner), Realty,
Dean Witter Reynolds Inc. and others as defendants was filed in Superior
Court in California.  The complaint alleges fraud, negligent
misrepresentation, intentional and negligent breach of fiduciary duty,
unjust enrichment and related claims and seeks compensatory and punitive
damages in unspecified amounts and injunctive and other equitable relief. 
The defendants have removed the case to the United States District Court
for the Southern District of California.  The defendants have not yet
responded to the complaint.  The defendants intend to vigorously defend
the action.

ITEM 4.      SUBMISSION OF MATTERS TO A VOTE OF SECURITY HOLDERS.

       No matter was submitted during the fourth quarter of the fiscal year
to a vote of Unit holders.

                                            PART II.

ITEM 5.   MARKET FOR THE REGISTRANT'S COMMON EQUITY AND RELATED        
          STOCKHOLDER MATTERS.

       An established public trading market for the Units does not exist,
and it is not anticipated that such a market will develop in the future. 
Accordingly, information as to the market value of a Unit at any given
date is not available.  However, the Partnership does allow its limited
partners (the "Limited Partners") to transfer their units if a suitable
buyer can be located.

       As of January 25, 1996, there were 27,685 holders of limited
partnership interests.

       The Partnership is a limited partnership and, accordingly, does not
pay dividends.  It does, however, make quarterly distributions of cash
to its partners.  Pursuant to the partnership agreement, distributable
cash, as defined, is paid 90% to the Limited Partners and 10% to the
general partners (the "General Partners").  

       The Partnership paid quarterly cash distributions during the year
ended October 31, 1995 aggregating $40.00 per Unit to Limited Partners. 
The total distribution amounted to $7,867,688, with $7,080,920
distributed to the Limited Partners and $786,768 distributed to the
General Partners.  Additionally, in fiscal 1995, the Partnership repaid
$2,784,417 of deferred distributions owed to the General Partners. 
During the year ended October 31, 1994, the Partnership paid quarterly
cash distribution aggregating $30.00 per Unit to Limited Partners.  The
total distribution amounted to $5,900,766, with $5,310,690 distributed
to the Limited Partners and $590,076 distributed to the General Partners.

       On November 28, 1995, the Partnership paid a cash distribution of
$10.00 per Unit to the Limited Partners.  The cash distribution
aggregated $1,966,922 with $1,770,230 distributed to the Limited Partners
and $196,692 distributed to the General Partners.  

       The Partnership anticipates making regular distributions to its
partners in the future.

       Sale or financing proceeds will be distributed, to the extent
available, first, to each Limited Partner, until there has been a return
of the Limited Partner's capital contribution plus cumulative
distributions of distributable cash and sale or financing proceeds in an
amount sufficient to provide a 9% cumulative annual return on the Limited
Partner's adjusted capital contribution.  Thereafter, any remaining sale
or financing proceeds will be distributed 85% to the Limited Partners and
15% to the General Partners after the Managing General Partner receives
a brokerage fee of up to 3% of the selling price of any equity
investment.

       Taxable income generally is allocated in the same proportions as
distributions of distributable cash or sale or financing proceeds (except
that the General partner must be allocated at least 1% of taxable income
from sales or financings).  In the event there is no distributable cash
or sale or financing proceeds, taxable income is allocated 90% to the
Limited Partners and 10% to the General Partners.  Any tax loss will be
allocated 90% to the Limited Partners and 10% to the General Partners.

ITEM 7.      MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND
             RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.

        Liquidity and Capital Resources

        The Partnership raised $177,023,000 in a public offering which was
terminated in 1985.  The Partnership has no plans to raise additional
capital.

        The Partnership has purchased six properties (one sold in May 1993,
and one sold subsequent to October 31, 1995) and made three investments
in partnerships on an all-cash basis.  The Partnership's acquisition
program has been completed.  No additional investments are planned.

        The condition of the real estate market varies among different
regions of the country and by property type.  The relative absence of
office construction as well as growth in business services is providing
for absorption of office space in cities such as Boston and Seattle (the
locations of Framingham Corporate Center and United Services Life,
respectively).  In contrast, office vacancy levels in Los Angeles,
suburban Philadelphia and Westchester County, New York (where Century
Square, Glenhardie Corporate Center and Taxter Corporate Park,
respectively, are located) remain essentially unchanged from the prior
years as certain large corporations and financial companies continue to
restructure and consolidate their operations.  In most markets, office
construction is limited to build-to-suit projects.  At retail properties,
the demand  for space for the first half of 1995 was subdued as a result
of generally sluggish retail sales and competition from large power
centers, discounters and reorganized department stores.
        
        Effective January 1, 1995, the lease term of Countrywide Credit
Industries, Inc., the largest tenant at the Century Square office
building, was extended from March 2000 to March 2010.  The rental rate
will remain at the 1994 rate through 2004, rather than increasing, as
provided for under the original leases.  After 2004, rents will increase
ten percent for the remainder of the lease term.  Considering the current
market and economic conditions in Pasadena, CA, and the credit-worthiness
of Countrywide, the Managing General Partner considers the terms of the
new agreement favorable.  The restructured lease is expected to result
in stable cash flow from this property for a total of fifteen years at
a higher level than comparable current market rents.

        In the fourth fiscal quarter of 1995, the Partnership determined to
sell the Wallkill Plaza Shopping Center and, in October entered into an
agreement (amended December 1, 1995) with New Plan Realty Trust, an
unaffiliated party, to do so, for a negotiated sale price of
approximately $12.2 million.

        At closing, $11 million of the sale price was received in cash.  The
remaining $1.2 million was represented by a promissory note, the
repayment of which is contingent on the resolution of the lease of
Bradlees, which is in bankruptcy.  The cash flow from operations from the
Wallkill Plaza Shopping Center was approximately $1.2 million for the
year ended October 31, 1995.  See Note 5 to the consolidated financial
statement in Item 8.

        The Partnership's liquidity depends on the cash flow from operations
of its properties, less expenditures for tenant improvements and leasing
commissions in connection with the leasing of space.  In 1995, all of the
Partnership's properties generated positive cash flow from operations,
and it is anticipated that they will continue to do so.

        In addition, the Partnership's liquidity is affected by the sale of
Partnership's properties.  The Partnership received $10.8 million in the
first fiscal quarter of 1996 from the sale of Wallkill Plaza.  In
accordance with the provisions of the Partnership Agreement, the net
sales proceeds of $60.65 per Unit will be distributed to the Limited
Partners in February 1996 and represents a return of invested capital. 
Because the Partnership has fewer income producing investments, the
Partnership's cash from operations available for distribution is expected
to decline in 1996 and thereafter.

        In 1995, the Partnership's cash flow from operations and
distributions received from its joint venture investment exceeded
distributions to partners, capital expenditures and minority interest
share of distributions from the Century Square property by approximately
$396,000.  The net decrease in cash and cash equivalents in 1995 is due
to the use of excess cash reserves to repay the deferred distributions
of $2,784,417 owed to the General Partners.  

        In 1995, the Partnership incurred approximately $2,492,000 of tenant
improvements and leasing commissions (net of capital contributions by
minority interest), including approximately $1,523,000 at the Century
Square building, approximately $402,000 at United Services Life Building,
and approximately $394,000 at the Framingham Corporate Center.  In 1994,
tenant improvements also approximated $2.5 million.  

        The Partnership has committed to demolish the existing A&P space at
Pavilions at East Lake (approximately 39,000 square feet) to build a new
Kroger supermarket (approximately 63,000 square feet) at an estimated
cost of $3.7 million.  In addition, the Partnership is considering
certain non-essential discretionary improvements and upgrades at the
United Services Life Building the cost of which could range between
$250,000 and $650,000.  These improvements will be funded from
Partnership's cash reserves.

        The decrease in other assets during the twelve months ended October
31, 1995 primarily resulted from the decrease in the accrual to recognize
rental income on a straight-line basis.

        On November 28, 1995, the Partnership paid a cash distribution of
$10.00 per Unit to the Limited Partners.  The cash distribution
aggregated $1,966,922 with $1,770,230 distributed to the Limited Partners
and $196,692 distributed to the General Partners.  

        Except as discussed above and in the Consolidated Financial
Statements, the Managing General Partner is not aware of any trends or
events, commitments or uncertainties that will have a material impact on
liquidity.

        Operations

        Fluctuations in the Partnership's operating results for the year
ended October 31, 1995 compared to 1994 and for the year ended October
31, 1994 compared to 1993 are primarily attributable to the following:

        The decrease in rental income in 1995 compared to 1994 is primarily
due to reduced pass-through income under the revised Countrywide lease
at the Century Square property.  The decrease in rental income in 1994
as compared to 1993 is primarily due to the sale of the Sardis Crossing
property in May 1993 and lower rents recognized at Glenhardie Corporate
Center I and Wallkill Plaza in 1994, offset by higher rental income at
the United Services Life Building and the Framingham Corporate Center. 

        The increase in equity in earnings (loss) of joint venture in 1994
compared to 1993 is due primarily to the Partnership's share of the
writedown for the impairment in value of Taxter Corporate Park of
approximately $4.1 million in the fourth quarter of 1993.  

        The increase in interest and other income in 1995 compared to 1994
is primarily due to lease termination income of approximately $354,000
from Blue Cross, the largest tenant at Framingham Corporate Center, which
terminated certain of its leases covering approximately 18% of the
property's space in the first quarter of 1995.  This space was re-leased
to new tenants prior to January 31, 1995.  

        Property operating expenses declined slightly in 1995 compared to
1994 primarily due to the absence of legal fees incurred in connection
with the lawsuit against a construction contractor at the Century Square
office building.  The slight decrease in property operating expenses in
1994 compared to 1993 is primarily attributable to lower utility and
repair and maintenance expenses at the Glenhardie office buildings in
1994 and the sale of the Sardis Crossing property in 1993, partially
offset by the absence of legal fees described earlier.
  
        Depreciation in 1995 decreased compared to 1994 primarily because
certain of the assets at Framingham Corporate Center and Glenhardie
Corporate Center are fully depreciated at October 31, 1994.  The increase
in depreciation in 1994 compared to 1993 reflects increased expenditures
for tenant improvements in 1994. 

        The increase in amortization in 1995 compared to 1994 relates to
increased expenditures for leasing commissions in 1995 mainly at the
Century Square property and the United Services Life building. 
Amortization decreased in 1994 compared to 1993 because of a substantial
portion of leasing commissions became fully amortized in 1993 at the
United Services Life and Pavilions at East Lake properties, and because
of the sale of the Sardis Crossing property.  These decreases are
partially offset by amortization on leasing commissions incurred
primarily at Glenhardie Corporate Center and Pavilions at East Lake in
fiscal 1993 and 1994.  

        The loss on write-down of real estate held for sale is discussed in
Note 5 to the financial statements in Item 8.

        The decreases in interest expense in 1994 compared to 1993 is due
to the repayment of the bank loan in June 1993. 

        The decrease in minority interest in 1995 compared to 1994 is mainly
attributable to reduced pass-through income under the revised Countrywide
lease at the Century Square property as well as an increase in
amortization expense from leasing commissions associated with the
Countrywide lease.

        The gain on sale of real estate in 1993 results from the sale of the
Sardis Crossing property.  Absent such gain, the Partnership would have
experienced a net loss in 1993.

        A summary of the markets in which the Partnership's office
properties are located and the performance of each property is as
follows:  

        The Boston suburban office market, the location of the Framingham
Corporate Center, is strong with a limited amount of space available. 
The current market vacancy rate is approximately 8% due to the relative
absence of office construction as well as growth in business services.
As of October 31, 1995, the building was 97% leased to 15 tenants. 
Tenants occupying more than 10% of rentable square feet are ASB Meditest,
Blue Cross/Blue Shield, NYNEX, and Customer Development.  Blue Cross
vacated its space in December 1994 and paid the Partnership a termination
fee of approximately $350,00 on approximately 28,000 square feet.  During
the first half of 1995, all of this space was re-leased to several
tenants at higher rental rates.  Blue Cross continues to pay rent on its
remaining 33,000 square feet of vacant space.  The lease on this space
expires October 1996.  The Partnership is working with Blue Cross to re-
lease this space.  The NYNEX lease for approximately 10% of the
property's space, expired in August 1995 and was extended through
December 1995.  The Partnership is currently marketing this space.

        The decline in the office market in Westchester County, New York,
the location of Taxter Corporate Park, has recently stabilized and the
current vacancy level in this market is approximately 22%.  The Managing
General Partner believes, it is unlikely that this vacant space will be
absorbed in the market for several years.  However, during 1995, and at
October 31, 1995, the property was 98% leased to 24 tenants.   KLM Royal
Dutch Airlines owns a long-term leasehold interest in approximately 20%
of the space at the property.  The leases of Fuji Photo Film, the other
major tenant (for approximately 24% of the property's space) have been
renewed through 2001.  Other leases aggregating approximately 12% of the
space are scheduled to expire in 1997.

        Glenhardie Corporate Center I and II are located in Valley Forge,
Pennsylvania, a market in which the vacancy rate is approximately 16%.
The area still experiences slow leasing activity and continues to face
corporate downsizing pressures.  As of October 31, 1995, the buildings
were 98% leased to 11 tenants.  Tenants occupying more than 10% of
rentable square feet are SunGuard Data Corporation and USERS Inc.  Leases
covering 11% of the space are due to expire in fiscal 1996.

        In Pasadena, California, the location of the Century Square office
building, the overall office market vacancy rate is approximately 15%,
and it is expected to remain constant as there has been a noticeable lack
of movement in that market.  However, Century Square remained 100% leased
during the year.  The property's largest tenant, Countrywide Credit,
occupies 84% of the property's rentable space.  No leases are due to
expire in fiscal 1996.

        The market in Bellevue, Washington, the location of the United
Services Life Building, has been absorbing office space at a steady pace
and the availability of sub-lease space is steadily declining which is
expected to result in increases in effective rents.  The market is
currently experiencing a 7% vacancy rate as the availability of large
blocks of contiguous space is limited.  The growth in the computer
industry and professional service firms has offset the employment loss
created by Boeing's downsizing over the past two years.  As of October
31, 1995, the building was 98% leased to 26 tenants.  Tenants occupying
more than 10% of rentable square feet are AT&T Wireless and Asymetrix. 
Asymetrix Corporation, which occupies approximately 30% of the property's
space and whose leases expire in late 1996 and 1998, has announced that
they will consolidate this office space at a different location.  Given
current markets conditions, the Partnership does not expect to have a
difficult time re-leasing this space.

        A summary of the markets in which the Partnership's retail
properties are located and the leasing status of each property are as
follows:

        Pavilions at East Lake is located in an area of suburban Atlanta
which experienced significant retail development in the 1980's.  Large
retailers of consumer electronics, appliances and toys continue to
increase retail market share at the expense of department stores and
smaller local tenants.  Currently, the vacancy rate in this market is
20%.  As of October 31, 1995, the center was 87% leased to 34 tenants. 
Tenants occupying more than 10% of rentable square feet are A&P and
Michaels.  A&P, which occupied 27% of the leased space had vacated its
space in 1994 but continued to pay rent.  A&P's lease was scheduled to
expire in 2006 but was cancelled in 1995 on payment of a termination fee. 
Its space is being demolished and a new Krogers prototype store is being
constructed at a cost of approximately $3.7 million. Rental revenue from
Kroger is expected to be slightly higher than the previous rental
revenues.  A new shopping center recently opened which directly competes
with the property.  

        Wallkill Plaza, located in Wallkill, New York is in an overbuilt
retail market.  However, occupancy at the property remained at 86%.  As
noted above, the property was sold subsequent to fiscal year-end.  See
Item 8 Financial Statements, Note 5.

         Inflation

        Inflation has been consistently low during the periods presented in
the financial statements and, as a result, has not had a significant
effect on the operations of the Partnership or its properties.

Independent Auditors' Report





To The Partners of
Dean Witter Realty Income Partnership II, L.P.:


We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Dean
Witter Realty Income Partnership II, L.P. and consolidated partnerships
(the "Partnership") as of October 31, 1995 and 1994 and the related
consolidated statements of operations, partners' capital, and cash flows
for each of the three years in the period ended October 31, 1995.  Our
audits also included the financial statement schedule listed in the Index
at Item 8.  These financial statements and financial statement schedule
are the responsibility of the Partnership's management.  Our
responsibility is to express an opinion on the financial statements and
the financial statement schedule based on our audits.

We conducted our audits in accordance with generally accepted auditing
standards.  Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit
to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are
free of material misstatement.  An audit includes examining, on a test
basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial
statements.  An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles
used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating
the overall financial statement presentation.  We believe that our audits
provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.

In our opinion, such financial statements present fairly, in all material
respects, the financial position of Dean Witter Realty Income Partnership
II, L.P. and consolidated partnerships as of October 31, 1995 and 1994,
and the results of their operations and their cash flows for each of the
three years in the period ended October 31, 1995 in conformity with
generally accepted accounting principles.  Also, in our opinion, such
financial statement schedule, when considered in relation to the basic
consolidated financial statements taken as a whole, presents fairly in
all material respects the information set forth therein.

                         NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

                               October 31, 1995, 1994 and 1993



1.   The Partnership

Dean Witter Realty Income Partnership II, L.P. (the "Partnership") is
a limited partnership organized under the laws of the State of Delaware
in 1984.  The Partnership is managed by Dean Witter Realty Income
Properties II Inc. (the "Managing General Partner").  The Partnership's
fiscal year ends on October 31.

In 1985, the Partnership issued 177,023 units of limited partnership
interest (the "Units") for $177,023,000.  No additional Units will be
sold.  The proceeds of the offering were used to make equity
investments in income-producing office and retail properties which were
not encumbered by debt when acquired.


2.   Summary of Significant Accounting Policies

The financial statements include the accounts of the Partnership and
the Century Square; and Framingham Corporate Center joint ventures on
a consolidated basis.  The equity method of accounting has been applied
to the Partnership's 14.8% interest in the Taxter Corporate Park
property because of the Partnership's continuing ability to exert
significant influence.  Affiliates of the Partnership, Dean Witter
Realty Income Partnership III, L.P. and Dean Witter Realty Income
Partnership IV, L.P. own the remaining 44.6% and 40.6% general
partnership interests, respectively.

The Partnership owns a 75% general partnership interest in Century
Square, an affiliate of the partnership, Dean Witter Realty Income
Partnership I, L.P., owns the remaining 25% general partnership
interest.  The Partnership owns a 95% general partnership interest in
Framingham Corporate Center; the Managing General Partner owns the
remaining 5% interest.

The Partnership's records are maintained on the accrual basis of
accounting for financial reporting and tax purposes.  The preparation
of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted
accounting principles requires management to make estimates and
assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities
and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the
financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses
during the reporting period.  Actual results could differ from those
estimates.


The carrying value of real estate includes the purchase price paid by
the Partnership and acquisition fees and expenses.  Costs of
improvements to the properties are capitalized, and repairs are
expensed.  Depreciation is recorded on the straight-line method.

At least annually, and more often if circumstances dictate, the
Partnership evaluates the recoverability of the net carrying value of
its real estate.  As part of this evaluation, the fair values of each
of the properties are estimated (in some cases with the assistance of
outside real estate consultants) based on discounted cash flows.  The
fair values are compared to the properties' carrying amounts in the
financial statements.  A deficiency in fair value relative to carrying
amount is an indication of the need for a writedown due to impairment. 
In such case, the expected future net cash flows from the property are
estimated for a period of approximately five years, along with
estimated sales proceeds at the end of the period.  If the total of
these future undiscounted cash flows were less than the carrying amount
of the property, the property would be written down to its fair value,
and a loss on impairment recognized by a charge to earnings.  The
Partnership's accounting policy complies with Statement of Financial
Accounting Standards No. 121, "Accounting for the Impairment of Long-
Lived Assets and for Long-Lived Assets to be Disposed Of".

Because the determination of fair value is based upon projections of
future economic events such as property occupancy rates, rental rates,
operating cost inflation and market capitalization rates which are
inherently subjective, the amounts ultimately realized at disposition
may differ materially from the net carrying value as of October 31,
1995.  The cash flows used to determine fair value and net realizable
value are based on good faith estimates and assumptions developed by
the Managing General Partner.  Unanticipated events and circumstances
may occur and some assumptions may not materialize; therefore actual
results may vary from the estimates and the variances may be material. 
The Partnership may provide additional write-downs which could be
material in subsequent years if real estate markets or local economic
conditions change.

Cash and cash equivalents consist of cash and highly liquid investments
with maturities, when purchased, of three months of less.

Deferred leasing commissions are amortized over the applicable lease
terms.

Rental income is accrued on a straight-line basis over the terms of the
leases.  Accruals in excess of amounts payable by tenants pursuant to
their leases (resulting from rent concessions or rents which
periodically increase over the term of a lease) are recorded as
receivable and included in other assets.

Net income (loss) per Unit amounts are calculated by dividing net
income (loss) allocated to Limited Partners, in accordance with the
Partnership Agreement, by the weighted average number of Units
outstanding.

No provision for income taxes has been made in the financial
statements, since the liability for such taxes is that of the partners
rather than the Partnership.

For income tax purposes, Partnership results are reported for the
calendar year.  The accounting policies used for tax reporting purposes
differ from those used for financial reporting as follows: (a)
depreciation is calculated using accelerated methods, (b) rental income
is recognized based on the payment terms in the applicable leases, and
(c) writedowns for impairment of real estate are not deductible.  In
addition, offering costs are treated differently for tax and financial
reporting purposes.  The tax basis of the Partnership's assets and
liabilities is approximately $11.0 million higher than the amounts
reported for financial statement purposes.

3.   Partnership Agreement

The Partnership Agreement provides that distributable cash, as defined,
is paid 90% to the Limited Partners and 10% to the General Partners. 

Sale or financing proceeds will be distributed, to the extent
available, first, to each Limited Partner, until there has been a
return of the Limited Partner's capital contribution, plus cumulative
distributions of distributable cash and sale or financing proceeds in
an amount sufficient to provide a 9% cumulative annual return on the
Limited Partner's adjusted capital contribution.  Thereafter, any
remaining sale or financing proceeds will be distributed 85% to the
Limited Partners and 15% to the General Partners after the Managing
General Partner receives a brokerage fee of up to 3% of the selling
price of any equity investment.          

Taxable income generally is allocated in the same proportions as
distributions of distributable cash or sale or financing proceeds
(except that the General partner must be allocated at least 1% of
taxable income from sales or financings).  In the event there is no
distributable cash or sale or financing proceeds, taxable income is
allocated 90% to the Limited Partners and 10% to the General Partners. 
Any tax loss will be allocated 90% to the Limited Partners and 10% to
the General Partners.

Distributions paid to limited partners include returns of capital per
Unit of limited partnership interest  of $40.00, $9.86 and $21.64 for
the years ended October 31, 1995, 1994 and 1993, respectively,
calculated as the excess of cash distributed per Unit over accumulated
earnings per Unit not previously distributed.<PAGE>

In fiscal 1994, the Century Square joint venture settled a lawsuit with
the developer of the property relating to certain defects in the
parking structure and heating, ventilation and air conditioning
systems.  Pursuant to the settlement, the joint venture received
$100,000 and $835,000 in 1995 and 1994, respectively, and will receive
an additional $100,000 in fiscal year 1996.  The Partnership recorded
proceeds of $27,000 and $835,000 in 1995 and 1994, respectively, which
represent the recovery of costs incurred and capitalized to correct the
defects, as a reduction of building and improvement costs.  The
remaining $73,000 of proceeds in 1995 represents a recovery of legal
costs.

5.  Sales of Real Estate

In the fourth fiscal quarter of 1995, the Partnership determined to
sell the Wallkill Plaza Shopping Center, and in October entered into
an agreement (amended December 1, 1995) with New Plan Realty Trust, an
unaffiliated party, to do so. 

As part of the agreement, two affiliated public partnerships, Dean
Witter Realty Income Partnership III, L.P. and Dean Witter Realty Yield
Plus L.P., also agreed to sell certain shopping centers owned by them.

The closing of the sale of the Wallkill Plaza Shopping Center, for a
negotiated sale price of approximately $12.2 million, took place on
December 11, 1995.

At closing, a contingent promissory note for $1.2 million of the
purchase price was issued by the Purchaser to the Partnership.  A
portion of the space in the Wallkill Plaza Shopping Center is leased
to The Stop & Shop Companies, Inc. ("S&S") and assigned to Bradlees,
which is in bankruptcy.  If, in the bankruptcy proceedings, the lease
is assumed by Bradlees, the note will be payable in full, plus interest
at 4.5%.  If, at December 11, 2000, the lease has neither been assumed
nor rejected nor deemed rejected by Bradlees, an amount equal to one
half of the promissory note, plus interest on such half will be
payable, and the remaining amount of the promissory note will be
forgiven.  If the lease is rejected or deemed rejected by Bradlees but,
until December 11, 2000, S&S makes all payments due under the lease,
the note will be payable in full, plus interest.  If, however, the
lease is rejected or deemed rejected by Bradlees and S&S does not make
all payments due under the lease during the five-year period ending
December 11, 2005, the promissory note will be forgiven and the
Purchaser shall have no obligation to pay the Partnership any portion
of the $1.2 million. 

Because of the sale , the net carrying value of the property has been
reclassified to real estate held for sale at October 31, 1995, and its
carrying value has been reduced to approximately $10.8 million,
resulting in a loss of approximately $4.9 million. In accordance with
the Partnership Agreement, 100% of the loss has been allocated to the
Limited Partners.  The reduced carrying value represents the cash
portion of the sale price, net of closing costs.  The portion of the
sale price represented by the $1.2 million promissory note has not been
recognized in revenue because of the uncertainty of its realization. 


The net income from the property included in the Partnership's
statement of operations was approximately $752,000 for the year ended
October 31, 1995.

In May 1993, the Partnership sold the Sardis Crossing property for
$6,450,000, less closing costs.  The net carrying value of the
property, including deferred costs, was approximately $5,585,000 at the
time of sale. $4,250,035 of the proceeds were used to repay the
Partnership's bank loan (which bore interest at prime plus three
quarter percent), and the remainder was distributed to the Limited
Partners.   The gain on the sale ($4.49 per Unit) was allocated 100%
to the Limited Partners, in accordance with the Partnership Agreement.

6.  Investment in Joint Venture

Taxter Corporate Park, Westchester County, New York

In 1986, the Partnership purchased a 14.8% general partnership interest
in the partnership which owns the property.  Affiliates of the
Partnership, Dean Witter Realty Income Partnership III, L.P. and Dean
Witter Realty Income Partnership IV, L.P. purchased the remaining 44.6%
and 40.6% general partnership interests, respectively.

The partners receive cash flow and profits and losses according to
their interests.

In fiscal 1993, in accordance with its policy for evaluating the
recoverability of its real estate (which are the same as the
Partnership's), the partnership which owns the property concluded that
the value of the property was impaired. Accordingly, the partnership
which owns the property recorded a loss on impairment of approximately
$27.8 million at October 31, 1993.  The Partnership's share of this
loss, approximately $4.1 million, was included in equity in earnings
(loss) of joint venture in 1993.

     The Partnership has determined that all leases relating to its properties
     are operating leases.  The lease terms range from two to fifteen years, 
     and generally provide for fixed minimum rents with rental escalation 
     and/or expense reimbursement clauses.

     Subsequent to year-end, the lease term of Countrywide Credit, the largest
     tenant at the Century Square office building, was extended from March 2000
     to March 2010.  The rental rate will remain constant over the next five
     years rather than increasing, as provided for under the original leases. 

8.  Related Party Transactions

An affiliate of the Managing General Partner provided property
management services for four properties in 1995 and 1994, and six
properties in 1993.  The Partnership paid the affiliate management fees
(included in property operating expenses) of approximately $296,000,
$295,000 and $321,000 for the years ended October 31, 1995, 1994 and
1993, respectively.

Another affiliate of the Managing General Partner performs
administrative functions and processes certain investor and tax
information on behalf of the Partnership.  For the years ended October
31, 1995, 1994 and 1993, the affiliate was reimbursed approximately
$522,000, $523,000 and $527,000, respectively, for these services. 
These amounts have been recorded in general and administrative
expenses.

As of October 31, 1995, the affiliate was owed approximately $163,000
for these services.

Through October 31, 1994 and 1993, the General Partners had deferred
receipt of an aggregate amount of $2,784,417 and $3,712,556,
respectively, of distributions to which they were entitled, including
distributions of approximately $148,000 in 1993.  Amounts deferred were
charged against partners' capital and recorded as liabilities to the
General Partners.  In fiscal 1995 and 1994, the Partnership repaid
$2,784,417 and 928,139, respectively, of deferred distributions owed
to the General Partners.

9.   Litigation

On December 27, 1995, a class action lawsuit naming various public real
estate partnerships sponsored by Dean Witter Realty Inc. ("Realty")
(including the Partnership and its Managing General Partner and
Associate General Partner), Realty, Dean Witter Reynolds Inc. and
others as defendants was filed in Superior Court in California.  The
complaint alleges fraud, negligent, misrepresentation, intentional and
negligent breach of fiduciary duty, unjust enrichment and related
claims and seeks compensatory and punitive damages in unspecified
amounts and injunctive and other equitable relief.  The defendants have
removed the case to the United States District Court for the Southern
District of California.  The defendants have not yet responded to the
complaint.  The defendants intend to vigorously defend the action.  
It is impossible to predict what financial exposure the Partnership may
have as a result of this litigation.

10.  Subsequent Event

On November 28, 1995, the Partnership paid a cash distribution of
$10.00 per Unit to the Partners.  The cash distribution aggregated
$1,966,922 with $1,770,230 distributed to the Limited Partners and
$196,692 distributed to the General Partners.  <PAGE>

ITEM 13.   CERTAIN RELATIONSHIPS AND RELATED TRANSACTIONS.

        As a result of their being partners of a limited partnership which
is the limited partner of the Associate General Partner, certain current
and former officers and directors of the Managing General Partner also
own indirect partnership interests in the Partnership.  The Partnership
Agreement of the Partnership provides that cash distributions and
allocations of income and loss to the general partners be distributed or
allocated 50% to the Managing General Partner and 50% to the Associate
General Partner.  The General Partners' share of cash distributions and
income or loss is described in Item 5 above.

        All of the outstanding shares of common stock of the Managing
General Partner are owned by Realty, a Delaware corporation which is a
wholly-owned subsidiary of Dean Witter, Discover & Co.  The general
partner of the Associate General Partner is Dean Witter Realty Income
Associates II Inc., which is a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Managing
General Partner.  The limited partner of the Associate General Partner
is LSA 84 II L.P., a Delaware limited partnership.  Realty and certain
current and former executive officers and directors of the Managing
General Partner are partners of LSA 84 II L.P.  Additional information
with respect to the directors and executive officers and compensation of
the Managing General Partner and affiliates is contained in Items 10 and
11 above.

        The General Partners and their affiliates were paid certain fees and
reimbursed for certain expenses.  Information concerning such fees and
reimbursements is contained in Note 8 to the Consolidated Financial
Statements in Item 8 above.  The Partnership believes that the payment
of fees and the reimbursement of expenses to the General Partners are on
terms as favorable as would be obtained from unrelated third parties.
