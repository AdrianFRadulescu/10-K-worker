any other business activities at this time.
                     The Company issues bonds from time to time in series, each

interest on the GNMA Certificates is guaranteed by GNMA.  The GNMA guaranty

the payment of principal and interest on the FNMA Certificates issued by it,

States.

Item 7.       Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and
              Results of Operations
              Results of Operations - Comparison of Years 1995, 1994 and 1993
                     During 1995, the Company issued four series of Mortgage
Certificate- Backed Bonds totaling $10,925,000.  During 1994, the Company
issued seven series of Bonds totaling $21,402,000.  During 1993, the Company
issued five series of Bonds totaling $15,636,000.  Total revenues, consisting
mostly of interest income, for 1995, 1994 and 1993 totaled $10,623,778,
$11,144,634 and $17,010,650, respectively.
                     As a result of lower interest rates, the Company experi-
enced a higher level of bond redemptions caused by the liquidation or sale of
Mortgage Certificates particularly in 1994 and 1993.  Bond redemptions fell
dramatically in 1995 which saw liquidation and sale volumes decline.  Total
bonds redeemed in 1995, 1994 and 1993 were $8,035,000, $52,154,000 and
$46,495,000, respectively.  These redemptions were based on Mortgage
Certificate sales and liquidations totaling $8,011,000, $33,126,000 and
$64,363,000 in 1995, 1994 and 1993, respectively.  These Mortgage Certificate
sales and liquidations and subsequent bond redemptions result in gains on sale
of mortgage certificates and offsetting increases in amortization of bond
issue costs in the Statements of Operations.
                     In accordance with a written management agreement,
management fees of the Company were limited to the amount which prevents the
Company from incurring a loss.  It is anticipated that the Company will
continue to operate at close to a breakeven level in future years.
              Liquidity and Capital Resources
                     The Company has no fixed assets nor any commitments
outstanding to purchase or lease any fixed assets.
                     Each series of bonds is structured in a manner such that
funds received from the related Mortgage Certificates are sufficient to fund
all interest and principal payments on the bonds, and all other expenses of
the Company.  This can be seen in the Condensed Statements of Cash Flows.  For
1995, there was a net decrease in cash and cash equivalents totaling
approximately $169,000 which was primarily caused by Company payments to B. C.
Ziegler and Company in satisfaction of previously accumulated management fees
of the Company and American Mortgage Securities, Inc. ("AMSI").  The Company
assumed the obligation to pay these amounts incurred by AMSI pursuant to the
merger of AMSI with and into the Company, as described below.  Net income was
zero because of the management fee paid to B. C. Ziegler and Company.  The
primary net cash disbursement from investing activities totaled $2,593,000
from an excess of amounts invested in the purchase of new Mortgage
Certificates which serve as collateral for the four Bond series issued during
1995 over the amounts received from Mortgage Certificate liquidations in that
same period.  This net disbursement was funded by the primary net cash
receipt, which totaled $2,562,000, which arose from an excess of cash received
from the issuance of the four Bond series during 1995 over cash disbursed to
redeem outstanding Bonds from previous series.
                     The Company has 15,000 shares of $9.00 non-cumulative, non-
voting preferred stock outstanding.  No dividends were declared or paid in
1995, 1994 or 1993.  The Company may redeem any or all of the preferred stock
at any time, at a redemption price of $100 per share.  During 1994, the
Company redeemed 5,000 shares.
                     Effective December 30, 1994, AMSI, another limited purpose
finance company organized to facilitate the financing of mortgage loans,
merged with and into the Company.  Prior to the merger, AMSI was owned 50% by
The Ziegler Companies, Inc. and 50% by Mr. James G. Pouros.  The Company
assumed all the assets and liabilities of AMSI at year end 1994.  These assets
and liabilities, primarily one outstanding bond issue totaling $1,961,000
which was collateralized by a separate pool of Mortgage Certificates totaling
$1,966,000, at amortized cost, are included in the Company's Balance Sheet as
of December 31, 1995 and 1994.  The merger produced no effect on the Company's
1994 operations since it was not effective until year end.
Item 8.       Financial Statements and Supplementary Data
                     The financial statements of the Company, together with the
related Notes to Financial Statements and Report of Independent Public
Accountants, are contained in the Financial Statements for the fiscal years
ended December 31, 1995, 1994 and 1993, included herein.
Item 9.       Disagreements with Accountants on Accounting and Financial
              Disclosure
                     There were no reports on Form 8-K reporting a change of
accountants or a disagreement with accountants on any matter of accounting
principles or practices on financial statement disclosure filed during the
fiscal year 1995.

Bend, Wisconsin 53095, each own 10,000 shares of common stock of the Company,
50% of the 20,000 outstanding shares of common stock of the Company, and each
of these owners has sole voting and dispositive powers.  B. C. Ziegler and

Company and the sole underwriter of the bonds offered by the Company, is a
wholly-owned subsidiary of The Ziegler Companies, Inc. and owns 15,000 shares

Item 13.      Certain Relationships and Related Transactions
                     B. C. Ziegler and Company, a wholly-owned subsidiary of The
Ziegler Companies, Inc. which owns 50% of the Company's outstanding stock
entered into a management agreement with the Company as of January 1, 1986. 
The management agreement provides that the manager is entitled to receive a
semiannual management fee not to exceed .375% of the aggregate outstanding
principal amount of bonds issued by the Company on the last day of the month
preceding such semiannual payment date.  The management fee is payable on each
semiannual payment date.  As soon as possible after the end of each fiscal
year of the Company, the Company is required to advise the manager of its
preliminary calculation of its net income or loss for such fiscal year.  In
the event such preliminary calculation indicates a loss, the amount of the
management fee for any such fiscal year shall be retroactively reduced to such
amount (not less than zero) as will prevent the Company from suffering a loss
(as determined by application of generally accepted accounting principles) for
such fiscal year.  Any such reduction in the management fee shall be applied
to reduce any balance due, and, to the extent it exceeds any balance due,
shall be promptly refunded to the Company.  The manager earned management fees
of $349,925 in 1995, $158,801 in 1994 and $179,930 in 1993.
                     B. C. Ziegler and Company also acts as underwriter for the
bonds issued by the Company.  In its capacity as underwriter, B. C. Ziegler
and Company receives a fee for its services equal to a percentage of the bonds
offered by the Company.
                     As of December 31, 1995 and 1994, the Company was indebted
to B. C. Ziegler and Company in the amount of $67,285 and $97,561,
respectively, for accrued management fees.  As of December 31, 1994, the
Company was also indebted to B. C. Ziegler and Company in the amount of
$142,636 which was the AMSI indebtedness to B. C. Ziegler and Company at the
time of the merger, discussed in Part II, Item 7 of this Form 10-K, of AMSI
into the Company.  As of December 31, 1994, the Company had a demand note with

                         REPORT OF INDEPENDENT PUBLIC ACCOUNTANTS
To the Stockholders and Board of Directors of 
  Ziegler Mortgage Securities, Inc. II:
       We have audited the accompanying balance sheets of ZIEGLER MORTGAGE
SECURITIES, INC. II (a Wisconsin corporation) as of December 31, 1995 and
1994, and the related statements of operations, changes in stockholders'
equity and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended
December 31, 1995.  These financial statements are the responsibility of the
Company's management.  Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these
financial statements based on our audits.
       We conducted our audits in accordance with generally accepted auditing
standards.  Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to
obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of
material misstatement.  An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence
supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements.  An audit
also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant
estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial
statement presentation.  We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis
for our opinion.
       In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present
fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of Ziegler Mortgage
Securities, Inc. II as of December 31, 1995 and 1994, and the results of its
operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended
December 31, 1995, in conformity with generally accepted accounting
principles.

                               NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
                                DECEMBER 31, 1995 AND 1994
(1)    Organization -
       Ziegler Mortgage Securities, Inc. II (the "Company") is a limited
       purpose finance company.  The Company was organized to facilitate the
       financing of mortgage loans.  The common stock of the Company is owned
       equally by The Ziegler Companies, Inc. and James G. Pouros.
(2)    Summary of Significant Accounting Policies -
       Mortgage Certificates are carried at par value less unamortized purchase
       discount.  The purchase discount on the Mortgage Certificates is
       amortized over the life of the related outstanding Mortgage Certificate-
       Backed Bonds (the "Bonds") using the bonds outstanding method which
       approximates the effective interest rate method.  The market values of
       the Mortgage Certificates at December 31, 1995 and 1994 were
       approximately $124,478,000 and $112,825,000, respectively.
       Deferred bond issuance costs consist of underwriting discounts and other
       expenses of issuance and distribution.  Such costs are amortized over
       the life of the outstanding Bonds using the bonds outstanding method
       which approximates the effective interest rate method.
       Cash equivalents are defined as unrestricted short-term investments
       maturing within three months of the date of purchase.  The $402,205
       demand note as of December 31, 1994 with The Ziegler Companies, Inc. is
       for funds deposited with The Ziegler Companies, Inc. which have been
       invested in daily reverse repurchase agreements collateralized by
       securities guaranteed by the full faith and credit of the United States.
       The preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally
       accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and
       assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities
       and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the dates of the
       financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses
       during the reporting periods.  Actual results could differ from those
       estimates.
(3)    Mortgage Certificates -
       The Mortgage Certificates consist of GNMA Certificates (comprising 89%
       of the portfolio as of December 31, 1995) guaranteed by the Government
       National Mortgage Association ("GNMA") and/or Guaranteed Mortgage
       Pass-Through Certificates (comprising 11% of the portfolio) issued by
       the Federal National Mortgage Association ("FNMA") (collectively the
       "Mortgage Certificates").  The full and timely payment of the principal
       and interest on the GNMA Certificates is guaranteed by GNMA.  The GNMA
       guaranty is backed by the full faith and credit of the United States
       government.  FNMA guarantees the payment of principal and interest on
       the FNMA Certificates but the FNMA guaranty is not backed by the full
       faith and credit of the United States government.
       Principal and interest payments received from the Mortgage Certificates
       are controlled by the trustee.  These funds are utilized to meet the
       semiannual interest payments on the Bonds, to reduce the outstanding
       principal balance of the Bonds and to pay certain operating expenses of
       the Company.
(4)    Mortgage Certificate-Backed Bonds Payable -
       Bonds outstanding at December 31, 1995, consist of the following:

       The stated maturities are the dates on which Bonds will be fully paid
       assuming no prepayments are received on the Mortgage Certificates which
       serve as collateral for the Bonds and no Bonds are called.  The stated
       maturities of the Bonds will be shortened by prepayments on the Mortgage
       Certificates and by any Bond calls.
       The Bonds can be redeemed each month without premium under the following
       circumstances:
              The Company must call the Bonds, to the extent funds are
              available, commencing in the twelfth month following the original
              issuance of each series or commencing at such time as the
              aggregate balance in the redemption fund, as defined in the
              prospectus, for each series that reaches $100,000; whichever
              occurs first.
              The Bonds of any series may be redeemed in whole by the Company
              after the third anniversary of the original issuance and,
              commencing with Series 16 bonds, at any time as the outstanding
              principal amount of such series is less than 10% of the aggregate
              principal amount of such series originally issued.
              Bondholders can present their Bonds for redemption each month
              commencing with the second calendar month following the month in
              which each series is originally issued.  The Company will redeem
              such Bonds to the extent funds are available.
       The market values in the secondary bond market of the Bonds outstanding
       as of December 31, 1995 and 1994, approximated $120,264,000 and
       $111,150,000, respectively.
(5)    Related Parties -
       B. C. Ziegler and Company, a wholly-owned subsidiary of The Ziegler
       Companies, Inc. which owns 50% of the Company's outstanding stock, is
       the sole underwriter for the Bonds issued by the Company.  In its
       capacity as underwriter, B. C. Ziegler and Company received a fee for
       its services equal to a percent of the Bonds offered by the Company.
       B. C. Ziegler and Company provided management and administrative
       services to the Company for which, pursuant to a management agreement
       with the Company, they were entitled to receive a management fee not to
       exceed .375% of the aggregate outstanding principal amount of bonds
       issued by the Company at the last day of the month preceding each
       semiannual payment date.  Any calculated management fee is retroactively
       reduced to such amount (not less than zero) as will prevent the Company
       from suffering a loss for each fiscal year.
       As of December 31, 1995 and 1994, the Company owed B. C. Ziegler and
       Company $67,285 and $97,561, respectively, for accrued management fees. 
       As of December 31, 1994, the Company also owed B. C. Ziegler and Company
       $142,636 which was AMSI indebtedness to B. C. Ziegler and Company at the
       time of the merger discussed below.  During 1994, the Company redeemed
       5,000 shares of the preferred stock from B. C. Ziegler and Company, the
       sole owner of the Company's preferred stock, for $500,000.
(6)    Merger -
       Effective December 30, 1994, the Company merged with American Mortgage
       Securities, Inc. ("AMSI"), another limited purpose finance company
       organized to facilitate the financing of mortgage loans.  Prior to the
       merger, AMSI was owned 50% by The Ziegler Companies, Inc. and 50% by Mr.
       James G. Pouros.  The Company was the surviving corporation and assumed
       all the assets and liabilities of AMSI at year end 1994.  These assets
       and liabilities, primarily one outstanding bond issue totaling
       $1,961,000 which is collateralized by a separate pool of Mortgage
       Certificates totaling $1,966,000, at amortized cost, are included in the
       Company's Balance Sheet as of December 31, 1994.  The merger produced no
       effect on the Company's 1994 operations since it was not effective until
       year end.
