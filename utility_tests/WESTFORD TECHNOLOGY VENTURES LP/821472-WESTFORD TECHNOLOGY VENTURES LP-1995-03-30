                                     PART I


Item 1.       Business.

Formation

Westford  Technology  Ventures,  L.P. (the  "Partnership") is a Delaware limited
partnership  formed on September 3, 1987.  WTVI Co., L.P., the managing  general
partner  of  the  Partnership  (the  "Managing  General   Partner"),   and  four
individuals (the "Individual  General Partners") are the general partners of the
Partnership.  Hamilton Capital Management Inc. (the "Management Company") is the
general partner of the Managing  General  Partner and the management  company of
the Partnership.  The Partnership began its principal  operations on December 1,
1988.

The Partnership  operates as a business development company under the Investment
Company  Act of 1940.  The  Partnership's  investment  objective  is to  achieve
long-term capital  appreciation by making venture capital investments in new and
developing  companies and other special investment  situations.  The Partnership
considers  this activity to constitute  the single  industry  segment of venture
capital investing.

In 1988 and 1989, the Partnership  publicly  offered,  through The  Stuart-James
Company, Incorporated (the "Selling Agent"), 35,000 units of limited partnership
interest  ("Units")  at $1,000  per Unit.  The Units were  registered  under the
Securities  Act of 1933 pursuant to a  Registration  Statement on Form N-2 (File
No. 33-16891) which was declared effective on May 12, 1988. The Partnership held
its initial  and final  closings  on  November  25,  1988 and January 31,  1989,
respectively.  A total of  11,217  Units  were  sold to  limited  partners  (the
"Limited  Partners").  Gross  capital  contributions  to the  Partnership  total
$11,333,170;  $11,217,000 from the Limited Partners,  $112,170 from the Managing
General Partner and $4,000 from the Individual General Partners.

The  Partnership is scheduled to terminate on December 31, 1998,  subject to the
right  of the  Individual  General  Partners  to  extend  the term for up to two
additional  two-year  periods if they determine that such  extensions are in the
best interest of the  Partnership.  The Partnership will terminate no later than
December 31, 2002.

The Venture Capital Investments

During the year ended December 31, 1994, the  Partnership  invested $1.5 million
in four existing portfolio  companies.  From its inception to December 31, 1994,
the  Partnership had invested $9.2 million in eight  portfolio  investments,  or
approximately  90% of the original net proceeds of $10.2  million  available for
investment in venture  situations.  At December 31, 1994,  the  Partnership  has
investments  in six portfolio  companies  with an aggregate cost of $7.7 million
and a fair  value of $7.5  million.  The  Partnership  has  fully  or  partially
liquidated  investments with an aggregate cost of $1.5 million. These liquidated
investments  returned  $385,000 to the Partnership.  As a result, as of December
31, 1994,  the  Partnership  had a cumulative net realized loss from its venture
capital investments of $1.1 million.

The Partnership's $3.4 million investment in Spectrix  Corporation was valued at
$3.8 million at December  31, 1994.  This  investment  represented  44.4% of the
total  cost and 51.2% of the total fair  value of the  Partnership's  investment
portfolio at December 31, 1994.

The  descriptions  of  the  Partnership's   follow-on  investments  in  Spectrix
Corporation and Thunderbird Technologies, Inc. set forth in Item 5 of Part II of
the Partnership's  quarterly report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended March 31,
1994 is incorporated herein by reference.

The description of the Partnership's follow-on investments in Spectrix set forth
in Item 5 of Part II of the Partnership's  quarterly report on Form 10-Q for the
quarter ended June 30, 1994 are incorporated herein by reference.

The  descriptions  of  the  Partnership's   follow-on  investments  in  Spectrix
Corporation,  Cybernetics Systems International Corp. and Inn-Room Systems, Inc.
set  forth in Item 5 of Part II of the  Partnership's  quarterly  report on Form
10-Q for the  quarter  ended  September  30,  1994 are  incorporated  herein  by
reference.

In October and November 1994, the Partnership  purchased 8% promissory  notes of
Spectrix Corporation aggregating $100,000 in face value and warrants to purchase
100,000 shares of the company at $.50 per share for $100,000.  In December 1994,
the Partnership  purchased  62,500 preferred shares of Spectrix for $250,000 and
converted its promissory notes totaling $500,000 and accrued interest of $18,940
into 129,735 preferred shares of the company.  Additionally,  in connection with
these transactions,  the Partnership received warrants to purchase 76,894 shares
of  Spectrix  common  stock at $.50 per share and a warrant to  purchase  25,000
shares of Spectrix common stock at $5 per share.

On November 22,  1994,  the  Partnership  purchased  214,800  shares of Inn-Room
Systems, Inc. common stock for $107,400.

During  December  1994,  the  Partnership  converted  its demand  notes due from
Cybernetics Systems International Corp. totaling $170,000 and $15,267 of accrued
interest into 840 preferred shares of the company.  Additionally,  in connection
with the note conversion,  the Partnership received a warrant to purchase 70,795
shares of the company's common stock at $.52 per share.

Competition

The  Partnership  encounters  competition  from other  entities  having  similar
investment  objectives.  Primary competition for venture capital investments has
been  from  venture  capital  partnerships  and  corporations,  venture  capital
affiliates  of  large  industrial  and  financial   companies,   small  business
investment companies and wealthy individuals.  Competition also may develop from
foreign  investors and from large industrial and financial  companies  investing
directly  rather than through venture  capital  affiliates.  The Partnership has
been a co-investor with other  professional  venture capital investors and these
relationships  have generally  expanded the  Partnership's  access to investment
opportunities.



<PAGE>


Employees

The Partnership has no employees.  The Managing General Partner,  subject to the
supervision  of the  Individual  General  Partners,  manages  and  controls  the
Partnership's  venture capital investments.  The Management Company performs, or
arranges  for others to perform,  the  management  and  administrative  services
necessary for the operation of the  Partnership  and is responsible for managing
the Partnership's short-term investments.

Item 2.       Properties.

The Partnership does not own or lease physical properties.

Item 3.       Legal Proceedings.

The Partnership is not a party to any material pending legal proceedings.

Item 4.       Submission of Matters to a Vote of Security Holders.

No matter was submitted to a vote of security  holders during the fourth quarter
of the fiscal year covered by this report.

                                    PART II

Item 5.  Market for Registrant's Common Equity and Related Stockholder Matters.

There is no  established  public  trading  market  for the  Units  and it is not
anticipated  that any public  market for the Units will  develop.  Consequently,
Limited  Partners  cannot  easily  liquidate  their  investment  in the event of
emergency or for other reasons.  Several independent  broker/dealers  provide an
informal secondary market for limited  partnership  interests.  Units of limited
partnership  interest of the  Partnership  have traded  through this market on a
limited  basis.  Transfers of Units are subject to certain  restrictions  in the
Partnership Agreement and also may be affected by restrictions on resale imposed
by the laws of certain states.  The approximate number of holders of Units as of
March 17, 1995 is 1,850.  The Managing  General  Partner and the four Individual
General Partners of the Partnership also hold interests in the Partnership.  See
Item 12 of this report  "Security  Ownership  of Certain  Beneficial  Owners and
Management".

The Partnership did not make any  distributions to its Partners in 1994, 1993 or
1992.

Item 7. Management's  Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results
        of Operations.

Liquidity and Capital Resources

At December 31,  1994,  the  Partnership  held  $779,000 in cash and  short-term
investments:  $498,000 in short-term securities with maturities of less than one
year and $281,000 in an  interest-bearing  cash account.  The Partnership earned
$53,000,  $89,000 and $191,000 of interest from such  investments  for the years
ended  December  31, 1994,  1993 and 1992,  respectively.  Interest  earned from
short-term   investments  in  future  periods  is  subject  to  fluctuations  in
short-term  interest  rates and changes in amounts  available for  investment in
such securities.

During 1994, the Partnership invested $1.5 in four existing portfolio companies.
From its  inception to December  31, 1994,  the  Partnership  had invested  $9.2
million in 8 venture capital investments,  representing 90% of the $10.2 million
of original net proceeds to the Partnership.

Funds  needed  to cover  the  Partnership's  future  follow-on  investments  and
operating  expenses will be obtained from existing cash  reserves,  interest and
other income from portfolio  investments and proceeds from the sale of portfolio
investments.

Results of Operations

For the years ended December 31, 1994,  1993 and 1992, the Partnership had a net
realized loss from operations of $679,000, $269,000 and $834,000,  respectively.
Net realized gain or loss from  operations is comprised of 1) net realized gains
or  losses  from  portfolio  investments  and 2) net  investment  income or loss
(interest and dividend income less operating expenses).

Realized  Gains and  Losses  from  Portfolio  Investments  - In June  1994,  the
Partnership realized a $384,000 loss from the sale of its investment in Eidetics
Incorporated.  The  Partnership  sold its  Eidetics  holdings,  along with other
former owners of Eidetics,  as part of a management  buyout of the company.  The
Partnership received a $4,190 cash down payment and potential future payments to
be determined by the actual cash receipts of the new company for five years from
the buyout date. At the time of the buyout,  such future payments were estimated
to aggregate $354,000 over the five year period.

The Partnership  had no realized gains or losses from portfolio  investments for
the year ended December 31, 1993.

For the year ended  December  31,  1992,  the  Partnership  had a  $700,000  net
realized loss from  portfolio  investments.  In November 1992,  Softstrip,  Inc.
filed for  protection  under  Chapter 11 of the federal  Bankruptcy  Code.  As a
result,  the Partnership  wrote-off its $500,000  investment in the company.  In
September  1992,  Picture  Productions,  L.P.  ("PPLP")  acquired  the assets of
Visicon,   Inc.  The  Partnership  sold  its  Visicon  holdings  for  a  limited
partnership interest in PPLP valued at $10,000,  resulting in a $200,000 loss on
its $210,000 investment in Visicon.

Investment  Income  and  Expenses  - Net  investment  loss for the  years  ended
December  31,  1994,  1993  and  1992  was  $295,000,   $269,000  and  $134,000,
respectively.  The $26,000  increase in net investment loss for 1994 compared to
1993 was the result of an $80,000  decrease in investment  income for 1994 which
was only partially offset by a $54,000 reduction in operating expenses for 1994.
Interest  earned from  short-term  investments  declined  $36,000 for 1994, from
$89,000 in 1993 to $53,000 in 1994. This decrease  primarily was the result of a
reduction  in the  amount  of funds  invested  in such  securities  during  1994
compared to 1993. Interest and other income from portfolio  investments declined
$45,000  for the 1994  period,  from  $86,000 in 1993 to  $41,000 in 1994.  This
decrease  primarily was due to the reversal,  during 1994, of $30,000 of accrued
interest due from Eidetics.  This  receivable was written-off in connection with
the sale of the  Partnership's  investment in Eidetics,  as discussed above. The
$54,000  decline in operating  expenses for 1994 compared to 1993,  primarily is
attributable  to $61,000 of  amortization  expense  included in the 1993 period.
Organizational  costs of $332,000 were  amortized  over a five year period which
was completed on December 1, 1993.

The $134,000 increase in net investment loss for 1993 compared to 1992 primarily
was due to a $165,000  decline in investment  income for 1993.  Interest  earned
from  short-term  investments  declined  $102,000  for  1993  compared  to 1992,
primarily due to a reduction in the amount of funds invested in such  securities
and a decline in  short-term  interest  rates  during  1993.  Interest and other
income from portfolio  investments  declined  $62,000 for 1993 compared to 1992,
primarily due to the  conversion of debt  securities  into equity  securities of
Spectrix during 1993. This $165,000  decline in investment  income was partially
offset by a $30,000  decline in operating  expenses  for 1993  compared to 1992,
primarily  due to a reduced  management  fee for the 1993  period,  as discussed
below.

The  Management  Company  performs,  or  arranges  for  others to  perform,  the
management  and  administrative  services  necessary  for the  operation  of the
Partnership.  The Management Company receives a management fee at an annual rate
of 2.5% of the gross capital  contributions  to the Partnership  (net of selling
commissions and  organizational  expenses paid by the  Partnership),  reduced by
capital  distributed and realized losses, with a minimum annual fee of $200,000.
The  management  fee for the years ended  December 31,  1994,  1993 and 1992 was
$226,000,  $234,000 and  $248,000,  respectively.  To the extent  possible,  the
management  fee and other  expenses  incurred by the  Partnership  are paid with
funds provided from  operations.  Funds provided from operations for the periods
discussed,  primarily  were  obtained from  interest  received  from  short-term
investments and interest and other income earned from portfolio investments.

Unrealized Gains and Losses and Changes in Unrealized  Appreciation of Portfolio
Investments  - For the year ended  December  31,  1994,  the  Partnership  had a
$45,000 net unrealized  loss  primarily  resulting from a decrease in the public
market price of Cincinnati Bell Inc.'s common stock.  Additionally  during 1994,
$225,000 was  transferred  from unrealized loss to realized loss due to the sale
of the  Partnership's  investment in Eidetics,  as discussed above. The $225,000
transfer from unrealized loss to realized loss less the $45,000  unrealized loss
resulted in a $180,000  increase in net unrealized  appreciation  of investments
for 1994.

For the year  ended  December  31,  1993,  the  Partnership  had a  $95,000  net
unrealized  gain from its portfolio  investments  resulting  from the net upward
revaluation of certain portfolio investments.

For the year ended December 31, 1992, the  Partnership had a net unrealized loss
of  $410,000  from  its  portfolio  investments,  primarily  resulting  from the
downward revaluation of its investments in Inn-Room Systems, Inc. and Cincinnati
Bell Inc.  Additionally during 1992, the Partnership  transferred  $375,000 from
unrealized  loss to realized loss relating to the write-off of its investment in
Softstrip,  as discussed  above.  The $410,000  unrealized  loss,  offset by the
$375,000  transfer from unrealized loss to realized loss,  resulted in a $35,000
decrease in the Partnership's unrealized appreciation of investments for 1992.

Net Assets - Changes to net assets resulting from operations are comprised of 1)
net  realized  gain or loss from  operations  and 2) changes  in net  unrealized
appreciation  or  depreciation  of  portfolio  investments.  For the years ended
December 31, 1994,  1993 and 1992,  Partnership had a net decrease in net assets
resulting from operations of $500,000, $173,000 and $869,000, respectively.

At December 31,  1994,  the  Partnership's  net assets were $8.4  million,  down
$500,000  from $8.9  million at December 31,  1993.  The  $500,000  decrease was
comprised  of the  $679,000  net  realized  loss from  operations  offset by the
$180,000 unrealized appreciation of investments for 1994.

At December 31,  1993,  the  Partnership's  net assets were $8.9  million,  down
$173,000 from $9.1 million at December 31, 1992.  This decrease was comprised of
the $269,000 net realized loss from operations offset by the $95,000  unrealized
appreciation of investments for 1993.

At December 31,  1992,  the  Partnership's  net assets were $9.1  million,  down
$869,000  from $10 million at December  31,  1991.  The  $869,000  decrease  was
comprised  of the $834,000 net  realized  loss from  operations  and the $35,000
unrealized depreciation of investments for 1992.

Gains and  losses  from  investments  are  allocated  to the  Partners'  capital
accounts when realized in accordance with the Partnership  Agreement (see Note 3
of Notes to Financial Statements).  However, for purposes of calculating the net
asset value per unit of limited  partnership  interest ("Unit"),  net unrealized
depreciation  of investments  has been included as if the net  depreciation  had
been  realized and  allocated  to the Limited  Partners in  accordance  with the
Partnership  Agreement.  Pursuant to such  calculation,  the net asset value per
$1,000  Unit at  December  31,  1994,  1993 and 1992 was  $744,  $788 and  $803,
respectively.

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT CERTIFIED PUBLIC ACCOUNTANTS




Westford Technology Ventures, L.P.


We have audited the accompanying  balance sheet of Westford Technology Ventures,
L.P. (the "Partnership"), including the schedule of portfolio investments, as of
December 31, 1994,  and the related  statements  of  operations,  cash flows and
changes in partners' capital for the year then ended. These financial statements
are the responsibility of the Partnership's management. Our responsibility is to
express an opinion on these financial statements based on our audit.

We conducted our audit in accordance with generally accepted auditing standards.
Those standards  require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable
assurance   about  whether  the  financial   statements  are  free  of  material
misstatement.  An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting
the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements.  An audit also includes
assessing the  accounting  principles  used and  significant  estimates  made by
management,  as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation.
We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.

In our opinion,  the financial  statements  referred to above present fairly, in
all material respects,  the financial position of Westford Technology  Ventures,
L.P. at December 31, 1994,  and the results of its operations and its cash flows
for the year  then  ended  in  conformity  with  generally  accepted  accounting
principles.

As explained in Note 2, the financial  statements include  investments valued at
$6,725,325,  representing 80% of partners' capital as of December 31, 1994 whose
values have been  estimated  by the managing  general  partner in the absence of
readily ascertainable market values. We have reviewed the procedures used by the
managing  general  partner  in  arriving  at its  estimates  of  value  of  such
investments   and  have   inspected   underlying   documentation   and,  in  the
circumstances,  we believe the procedures  are reasonable and the  documentation
appropriate.  However,  because of the inherent uncertainty of valuation,  those
estimated values may differ  significantly  from the values that would have been
used and a ready market for the investments  existed,  and the differences could
be material.

INDEPENDENT AUDITORS' REPORT




Westford Technology Ventures, L.P.


We have audited the accompanying  balance sheet of Westford Technology Ventures,
L.P. (the "Partnership"), including the schedule of portfolio investments, as of
December 31, 1993,  and the related  statements of operations,  cash flows,  and
changes  in  partners'  capital  for each of the two years in the  period  ended
December 31, 1993.  These  financial  statements are the  responsibility  of the
Partnership's  management.  Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these
financial statements based on our audits.

We  conducted  our  audits  in  accordance  with  generally   accepted  auditing
standards.  Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material
misstatement.  An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting
the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our procedures included
confirmation of securities owned at December 31, 1993 by correspondence with the
custodian;  where  confirmation  was not  possible,  we  performed  other  audit
procedures.  An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and
significant  estimates  made by  management,  as well as evaluating  the overall
financial  statement  presentation.   We  believe  that  our  audits  provide  a
reasonable basis for our opinion.

In our  opinion,  such  financial  statements  present  fairly,  in all material
respects,  the  financial  position of  Westford  Technology  Ventures,  L.P. at
December 31, 1993, and the results of its operations, its cash flows and changes
in its partners'  capital for each of the two years in the period ended December
31, 1993 in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles.

As explained in Note 2, the financial  statements  include  securities valued at
$5,682,293  at December 31, 1993  representing  64% of net assets,  whose values
have been  estimated by the Managing  General  Partner in the absence of readily
ascertainable  market  values.  We  have  reviewed  the  procedures  used by the
Managing General Partner in arriving at its estimate of value of such securities
and have  inspected  underlying  documentation,  and, in the  circumstances,  we
believe  the  procedures  are  reasonable  and  the  documentation  appropriate.
However,  because of the inherent  uncertainty  of  valuation,  those  estimated
values may differ  significantly from the values that would have been used had a
ready market for the securities existed, and the differences could be material.

     the actual cash receipts of the  acquiring  company for five years from the
     buyout date. The Partnership recorded a $251,000 receivable related to such

WESTFORD TECHNOLOGY VENTURES, L.P.
NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS


1.     Organization and Purpose

Westford  Technology  Ventures,  L.P. (the  "Partnership") is a Delaware limited
partnership  formed on September 3, 1987.  WTVI Co., L.P., the managing  general
partner of the Partnership (the "Managing General Partner") and four individuals
(the "Individual General Partners") are the general partners of the Partnership.
Hamilton  Capital  Management  Inc.  (the  "Management  Company") is the general
partner  of the  Managing  General  Partner  and the  management  company of the
Partnership. The Partnership began its principal operations on December 1, 1988.

The  Partnership's  objective is to achieve  long-term  capital  appreciation by
making venture  capital  investments  in new and developing  companies and other
special  investment  situations.  The  Partnership  will not engage in any other
business or  activity.  The  Partnership  will  terminate  on December 31, 1998,
subject to the right of the Individual  General  Partners to extend the term for
up to two additional two-year periods.

2.     Significant Accounting Policies

Valuation of Investments - Short-term  investments are carried at amortized cost
which approximates  market.  Portfolio  investments are carried at fair value as
determined  quarterly by the Managing  General  Partner under the supervision of
the  Individual  General  Partners.  The fair value of  publicly-held  portfolio
securities is adjusted to the average  closing  public market price for the last
five trading days of each quarter  discounted by a factor of 0% to 50% for sales
restrictions. Factors considered in the determination of an appropriate discount
include,  underwriter lock-up or Rule 144 trading  restrictions,  insider status
where  the  Partnership  either  has a  representative  serving  on the Board of
Directors or is greater than a 10% shareholder, and other liquidity factors such
as the size of the  Partnership's  position in a given  company  compared to the
trading history of the public security.  Privately-held portfolio securities are
carried at cost until significant  developments  affecting the portfolio company
provide a basis for change in valuation. The fair value of private securities is
adjusted 1) to reflect meaningful third-party transactions in the private market
or 2) to reflect  significant  progress or slippage  in the  development  of the
company's  business such that cost is no longer  reflective of fair value.  As a
venture capital investment fund, the Partnership's portfolio investments involve
a high  degree of business  and  financial  risk that can result in  substantial
losses.  The Managing  General  Partner  considers such risks in determining the
fair value of the Partnership's portfolio investments.

Investment  Transactions - Investment  transactions  are recorded on the accrual
method.  Portfolio  investments  are  recorded on the trade  date,  the date the
Partnership  obtains an  enforceable  right to demand the  securities or payment
therefor.  Realized  gains and  losses on  investments  sold are  computed  on a
specific identification basis.



<PAGE>


WESTFORD TECHNOLOGY VENTURES, L.P.
NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS


Income Taxes - No provision  for income taxes has been made since all income and
losses are  allocable to the Partners for inclusion in their  respective  income
tax returns.  The  Partnership's  net assets for  financial  reporting  purposes
differ from its net assets for tax  purposes.  Net  unrealized  depreciation  of
$226,634 at December  31,  1994,  which was  recorded  for  financial  statement
purposes, was not recognized for tax purposes.  Additionally,  from inception to
December 31,  1994,  timing  differences  relating to realized  losses  totaling
$382,000  have been  deducted  on the  Partnership's  financial  statements  and
syndication  costs  relating to the selling of Units  totaling $1.2 million were
charged to partners' capital on the financial statements. These amounts have not
been deducted or charged against partners' capital for tax purposes.

Statements of Cash Flows - The  Partnership  considers cash held in its interest
bearing cash account to be cash equivalents.

Organizational  Costs -  Organizational  costs of $331,596 were amortized over a
sixty-month period which commenced on December 1, 1988.

3.     Allocation of Partnership Profits and Losses

The  Partnership  Agreement  provides that the Managing  General Partner will be
allocated,  on a cumulative basis over the life of the  Partnership,  20% of the
Partnership's  aggregate  investment  income and net realized gains from venture
capital investments,  provided that such amount is positive. All other gains and
losses of the Partnership  are allocated  among all the Partners,  including the
Managing   General   Partner,   in  proportion  to  their   respective   capital
contributions to the Partnership.

4.     Related Party Transactions

The  Management  Company  provides,  or  arranges  for  others to  provide,  the
management  and  administrative  services  necessary  for the  operation  of the
Partnership.  For these services,  the Management  Company receives a management
fee at an  annual  rate  of  2.5%  of the  gross  capital  contributions  to the
Partnership (net of selling commissions and organizational  expenses paid by the
Partnership), reduced by capital distributed and realized losses, with a minimum
fee of $200,000 per annum. Such fee is determined quarterly and paid monthly.

5.     Independent General Partners' Fees

As  compensation  for services  rendered to the  Partnership,  each of the three
Independent General Partners receives $10,000 annually in quarterly installments
and $1,000 for each meeting of the Independent  General Partners attended,  plus
out-of-pocket expenses.

Item 9.  Changes  in  and  Disagreements  with  Accountants  on  Accounting  and
         Financial Disclosure.

On September 12, 1994, the Partnership  received a letter from Deloitte & Touche
LLP confirming that the client-auditor relationship between them had ceased. The
principal  reason for terminating the relationship was that the relatively small
size of the Partnership had made it increasingly difficult for Deloitte & Touche
LLP to serve as auditor on a  cost-effective  basis.  The  Deloitte & Touche LLP
reports on the  financial  statements  of the  Partnership  for the years  ended
December 31, 1993 and 1992 did not contain an adverse opinion or a disclaimer of
opinion,  nor were such reports  qualified or modified as to uncertainty,  audit
scope, or accounting principles.

During the two years ended December 31, 1993 and through September 12, 1994, the
date  the  relationship  ceased,  there  were  no  "disagreements"  between  the
Partnership and Deloitte & Touche LLP or "reportable  events" as defined in Item
304 of Regulation S-K.

On December  1, 1994,  the  Partnership  appointed  BDO  Seidman as  independent
accountants of the  Partnership,  commencing  with the year ending  December 31,
1994.
