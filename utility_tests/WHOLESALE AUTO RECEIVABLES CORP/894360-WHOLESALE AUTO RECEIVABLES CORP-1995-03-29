INDEPENDENT AUDITORS' REPORT


                                                          March 10, 1995


The Superior Wholesale Inventory Financing Trust I, its Noteholders and
Certificateholders, Wholesale Auto Receivables Corporation, Citibank
Delaware, Owner Trustee, and The Bank of New York, Indenture Trustee:

We have audited the accompanying Statement of Assets, Liabilities and
Equity of the Superior Wholesale Inventory Financing Trust I as of December
31, 1994, and the related Statement of Distributable Income for the period
January 25, 1994 (inception) through December 31, 1994.  These financial
statements are the responsibility of the Trust's management.  Our
responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements based
on our audit.

We conducted our audit in accordance with generally accepted auditing
standards.  Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to
obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free
of material misstatement.  An audit includes examining, on a test basis,
evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial
statements.  An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles
used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating
the overall financial statement presentation.  We believe that our audit
provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.

As described in Note 1 to the financial statements, these financial
statements are prepared on the basis of cash receipts and disbursements,
which is a comprehensive basis of accounting other than generally accepted
accounting principles.

In our opinion, such financial statements present fairly, in all material
respects, the assets, liabilities and equity of the Superior Wholesale
Inventory Financing Trust I at December 31, 1994, and its distributable
income and distributions for the period January 25, 1994 (inception)
through December 31, 1994, on the basis of accounting described in Note 1.

SUPERIOR WHOLESALE INVENTORY FINANCING TRUST I (continued)

NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

NOTE 1.  BASIS OF ACCOUNTING

The financial statements of Superior Wholesale Inventory Financing Trust I
(the "Trust") are prepared on the basis of cash receipts and cash
disbursements.  Such financial statements differ from financial statements
prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in
that interest income and the related assets are recognized when received
rather than when earned and distributions to noteholders and
certificateholders are recognized when paid rather than when the respective
obligation is incurred.  Certain expenses of the Trust are paid by
Wholesale Auto Receivables Corporation (the "Seller").

NOTE 2.  SALE OF NOTES AND CERTIFICATES

On January 25, 1994, the Trust acquired the Seller's right, title and
interest in wholesale finance receivables totaling approximately $2,232.3
million from the Seller in exchange for two types of Asset-Backed Notes
representing indebtedness of the Trust of $1,250.0 million Floating Rate
Term Notes, $850.3 million Floating Rate Revolving Notes and $132.0 million
Asset-Backed Certificates representing equity interests in the Trust.  The
Trust property includes certain Eligible Receivables in Accounts included
in a Pool of Accounts, certain Receivables generated under each such
Account from time to time secured by automobiles and light trucks, certain
monies due or received thereunder, an interest rate swap and certain other
property.

NOTE 3.  PRINCIPAL AND INTEREST PAYMENTS

In the ordinary course, no principal payments will be made on the Term
Notes until the commencement of the Wind Down Period (January 1997). 
During the Revolving Period, the Trust will make payments of principal on,
or additional borrowings (up to the Maximum Revolver Balance) under, the
Revolving Notes on a daily basis.

The then-unpaid principal balance of the Term Notes will be payable on
January 15, 1999.  The then-unpaid principal balance of the Revolving Notes
will be payable on January 15, 1999.  The then-unpaid balance of the
Certificates will be distributable on January 15, 1999.

Payments of interest on the existing Notes and Certificates are made on the
fifteenth day of each month or, if any such day is not a Business Day, on
the next succeeding Business Day, (each, a "Distribution Date"), commencing
February 15, 1994 (the "Initial Distribution Date").

     The Term Notes interest rate equals LIBOR plus 0.15% per annum for each
Distribution Date.  Interest on the Term Notes will accrue from, and
including, the most recent Distribution Date to, but excluding, the current
Distribution Date. The Term Noteholders received interest at a weighted
average rate of 4.472% per annum from January 25 through December 14, 1994.
 
The Revolving Notes interest rate equals LIBOR plus 0.30% per annum
for each Distribution Date.  Interest on the Revolving Notes accrue for the
Collection Period (calendar month) immediately preceding each Distribution
Date.  The Revolving Noteholders received interest at a weighted average
rate of 4.417% per annum from January 25 through November 30, 1994.

The Certificates interest rate equals LIBOR plus 0.45% per annum for each
Distribution Date.  Interest on the Certificates accrues from, and
including, the most recent Distribution Date to, but excluding, the current
Distribution Date.  The Certificateholders received interest at a weighted
average rate of 4.772% per annum from January 25 through 
December 14, 1994.  The final scheduled distribution date for the
Certificates is January 15, 1999.

SUPERIOR WHOLESALE INVENTORY FINANCING TRUST I (continued)

NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (concluded)

NOTE 4.  DERIVATIVE FINANCIAL INSTRUMENT AND RISK MANAGEMENT

The Trust is a party to an interest rate basis swap to manage exposure to
interest rate fluctuations for rates paid on Asset-Backed Notes and Asset-
Backed Certificates.  The interest rate basis swap agreement is a
contractual agreement between the Trust and GMAC to exchange floating
interest rate payments.

Credit risk of the instrument is limited to payments due from the
counterparty.  If the counterparty had defaulted, the potential benefit to
the Trust, if the positions were replaced at market rates in effect at
December 31, 1994, would have been $12.1 million.  Market risk is mitigated
because the derivative is used to hedge a portfolio of underlying debt
obligations.

The notional amount of the interest rate basis swap approximates the
outstanding balance in the Asset-Backed Notes and Asset-Backed Certificates.



NOTE 5.  FEDERAL INCOME TAX

The Trust is classified as a partnership, and therefore is not taxable as a
corporation for federal income tax purposes.  Each Noteholder and
Certificateholder, by acceptance of a Note or Certificate, agrees to treat
the Note as indebtedness and the Certificate as an equity interest in the
Trust for federal, state and local income and franchise tax purposes.
