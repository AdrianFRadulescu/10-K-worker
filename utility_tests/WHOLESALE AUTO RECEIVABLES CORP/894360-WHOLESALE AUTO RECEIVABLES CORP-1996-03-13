                          INDEPENDENT AUDITORS' REPORT


March 1, 1996


The  Superior  Wholesale  Inventory  Financing  Trust  I,  its  Noteholders  and
Certificateholders,  Wholesale Auto Receivables Corporation,  Citibank Delaware,
Owner Trustee, and The Bank of New York, Indenture Trustee:

We have audited the accompanying Statement of Assets,  Liabilities and Equity of
the Superior Wholesale  Inventory  Financing Trust I as of December 31, 1995 and
1994,  and the  related  Statement  of  Distributable  Income for the year ended
December 31, 1995 and the period January 25, 1994  (inception)  through December
31, 1994.  These  financial  statements  are the  responsibility  of the Trust's
management.  Our  responsibility  is to express  an  opinion on these  financial
statements based on our audits.

We  conducted  our  audits  in  accordance  with  generally   accepted  auditing
standards.  Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material
misstatement.  An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting
the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements.  An audit also includes
assessing the  accounting  principles  used and  significant  estimates  made by
management,  as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation.
We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.

As described in Note 1 to the financial  statements,  these financial statements
are  prepared  on the  basis  of cash  receipts  and  disbursements,  which is a
comprehensive  basis of  accounting  other than  generally  accepted  accounting
principles.

In our  opinion,  such  financial  statements  present  fairly,  in all material
respects, the assets, liabilities and equity of the Superior Wholesale Inventory
Financing  Trust I at December 31, 1995 and 1994, and its  distributable  income
and  distributions  for the year ended  December 31, 1995 and the period January
25, 1994  (inception)  through  December  31, 1994,  on the basis of  accounting
described in Note 1.

                   SUPERIOR WHOLESALE INVENTORY FINANCING TRUST I


                          NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

NOTE 1.  BASIS OF ACCOUNTING

The financial  statements of Superior Wholesale Inventory Financing Trust I (the
"Trust") are prepared on the basis of cash receipts and cash disbursements. Such
financial  statements  differ from financial  statements  prepared in accordance
with generally  accepted  accounting  principles in that interest income and the
related  assets  are  recognized  when  received  rather  than when  earned  and
distributions  to noteholders  and  certificateholders  are recognized when paid
rather than when the respective obligation is incurred.  Certain expenses of the
Trust are paid by Wholesale Auto Receivables Corporation (the "Seller").

NOTE 2.  SALE OF NOTES AND CERTIFICATES

On January 25, 1994, the Trust acquired the Seller's  right,  title and interest
in wholesale finance receivables  totaling  approximately  $2,232.3 million from
the  Seller  in  exchange  for two  types  of  Asset-Backed  Notes  representing
indebtedness of the Trust of $1,250.0 million  Floating Rate Term Notes,  $850.3
million   Floating  Rate  Revolving   Notes  and  $132.0  million   Asset-Backed
Certificates  representing  equity  interests in the Trust.  The Trust  property
includes  certain  Eligible  Receivables  in  Accounts  included  in a  Pool  of
Accounts,  certain  Receivables  generated  under each such Account from time to
time secured by new and used automobiles and light trucks, certain monies due or
received thereunder, an interest rate basis swap and certain other property.

NOTE 3.  PRINCIPAL AND INTEREST PAYMENTS

In the ordinary  course,  no principal  payments  will be made on the Term Notes
until the  commencement  of the Wind Down  Period  (January  1997).  During  the
Revolving  Period,  the Trust will make  payments of principal on, or additional
borrowings (up to the Maximum Revolver  Balance) under, the Revolving Notes on a
daily basis.

The  then-unpaid  principal  balance of the Term  Notes,  Revolving  Notes,  and
Certificates will be payable on January 15, 1999.

Payments of  interest on the  existing  Notes and  Certificates  are made on the
fifteenth  day of each month or, if any such day is not a Business  Day,  on the
next succeeding Business Day, (each, a "Distribution Date"), commencing February
15, 1994 (the "Initial Distribution Date").

The Term Notes  interest  rate equals  LIBOR plus 15 basis  points per annum for
each  Distribution  Date.  Interest  on the Term Notes  will  accrue  from,  and
including,  the most recent  Distribution  Date to, but  excluding,  the current
Distribution Date. The Term Noteholders  received interest at a weighted average
rate of 5.354 percent per annum from January 25, 1994 through December 14, 1995.

The  Revolving  Notes  interest rate equals LIBOR plus 30 basis points per annum
for each  Distribution  Date.  Interest on the  Revolving  Notes  accrue for the
Collection Period (calendar month) immediately preceding each Distribution Date.
The Revolving  Noteholders received interest at a weighted average rate of 5.617
percent per annum from January 25, 1994 through November 30, 1995.

NOTE 3.  PRINCIPAL AND INTEREST PAYMENTS (concluded)

The  Certificates  interest rate equals LIBOR plus 45 basis points per annum for
each  Distribution  Date.  Interest  on  the  Certificates   accrues  from,  and
including,  the most recent  Distribution  Date to, but  excluding,  the current
Distribution  Date.  The  Certificateholders  received  interest  at a  weighted
average rate of 5.654  percent per annum from January 25, 1994 through  December
14, 1995. The final scheduled  distribution date for the Certificates is January
15, 1999.


NOTE 4. DERIVATIVE FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS AND RISK MANAGEMENT

The Trust is a party to an interest  rate basis swap  contract  with an embedded
interest  rate floor to manage  exposure  to  interest  rate  fluctuations.  The
interest rate basis swap, which relates to the  Asset-Backed  Term Notes and the
Asset-Backed Certificates, is a contractual agreement between the Trust and GMAC
to exchange  floating  interest  rate  payments  (i.e.  the Trust pays Prime and
receives  London  Interbank  Offering Rate (LIBOR) plus 185 basis  points).  The
embedded floor, which relates to the Asset-Backed  Revolving Notes, provides the
Trust with monthly cash settlements from GMAC for an amount equal to the excess,
if any, of the One Month LIBOR rate plus 150 basis points over the Prime rate.

Market risk is mitigated  because the  derivatives are used to hedge a portfolio
of underlying  debt  and equity obligations.  Credit risk of the  instruments is
limited to payments due from GMAC. If GMAC had defaulted,  the potential benefit
(cost) to the Trust, if the positions were replaced at market rates in effect at
December 31, 1995 and 1994, would have been as follows:

                                             1995         1994
                                         (in millions of dollars)
       Interest Rate Basis Swap            $(14.5)       $(16.4)
       Interest Rate Floor                     .1           4.3
                                           $(14.4)       $(12.1)

The  notional  amount of the  interest  rate basis swap  including  the embedded
interest rate floor  approximates  the outstanding  balance in the  Asset-Backed
Notes and Asset-Backed Certificates.


NOTE 5. FEDERAL INCOME TAX

The Trust is  classified  as a  partnership,  and  therefore is not taxable as a
corporation   for   federal   income   tax   purposes.   Each   Noteholder   and
Certificateholder,  by acceptance of a Note or Certificate,  agrees to treat the
Note as indebtedness  and the Certificate as an equity interest in the Trust for
federal, state and local income and franchise tax purposes.

                          INDEPENDENT AUDITORS' REPORT


March 1, 1996


The  Superior  Wholesale  Inventory  Financing  Trust II,  its  Noteholders  and
Certificateholders,  Wholesale Auto Receivables Corporation, The Chase Manhattan
Bank (USA), Owner Trustee, and The Bank of New York, Indenture Trustee:

We have audited the accompanying Statement of Assets,  Liabilities and Equity of
the Superior Wholesale Inventory Financing Trust II as of December 31, 1995, and
the related  Statement of  Distributable  Income for the period  August 22, 1995
(inception)  through  December  31, 1995.  These  financial  statements  are the
responsibility of the Trust's  management.  Our  responsibility is to express an
opinion on these financial statements based on our audit.

We conducted our audit in accordance with generally accepted auditing standards.
Those standards  require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable
assurance   about  whether  the  financial   statements  are  free  of  material
misstatement.  An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting
the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements.  An audit also includes
assessing the  accounting  principles  used and  significant  estimates  made by
management,  as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation.
We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.

As described in Note 1 to the financial  statements,  these financial statements
are  prepared  on the  basis  of cash  receipts  and  disbursements,  which is a
comprehensive  basis of  accounting  other than  generally  accepted  accounting
principles.

In our  opinion,  such  financial  statements  present  fairly,  in all material
respects, the assets, liabilities and equity of the Superior Wholesale Inventory
Financing  Trust II at  December  31,  1995,  and its  distributable  income and
distributions  for the period August 22, 1995  (inception)  through December 31,
1995, on the basis of accounting described in Note 1.

                   SUPERIOR WHOLESALE INVENTORY FINANCING TRUST II


                          NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

NOTE 1.  BASIS OF ACCOUNTING

The financial statements of Superior Wholesale Inventory Financing Trust II (the
"Trust") are prepared on the basis of cash receipts and cash disbursements. Such
financial  statements  differ from financial  statements  prepared in accordance
with generally  accepted  accounting  principles in that interest income and the
related  assets  are  recognized  when  received  rather  than when  earned  and
distributions  to noteholders  and  certificateholders  are recognized when paid
rather than when the respective obligation is incurred.  Certain expenses of the
Trust are paid by Wholesale Auto Receivables Corporation (the "Seller").

NOTE 2.  SALE OF NOTES AND CERTIFICATES

On August 22, 1995, the Trust acquired the Seller's right, title and interest in
wholesale finance receivables totaling  approximately  $1,889.5 million from the
Seller in exchange for two types of Asset-Backed Notes representing indebtedness
of the Trust of  $1,000.0  million  Floating  Rate Term  Notes,  $816.7  million
Floating  Rate  Revolving  Notes and  $72.8  million  Asset-Backed  Certificates
representing  equity interests in the Trust. The Trust property includes certain
Eligible  Receivables  in  Accounts  included  in a Pool  of  Accounts,  certain
Receivables  generated  under each such Account from time to time secured by new
and  used  automobiles  and  light  trucks,   certain  monies  due  or  received
thereunder, an interest rate basis swap and certain other property.

The terms of the sale  transaction  include a revolving  and a wind down period.
The  revolving  period  began on August 18,  1995 and the wind down  period will
begin  on  the  day  immediately   following  the  scheduled   revolving  period
termination date. The scheduled  revolving period  termination  date,  initially
June 30, 1996, will automatically be extended to the last day of each succeeding
month (but not beyond  June 30,  1998)  unless  GMAC  gives  notice  that it has
elected not to cause such extension.

NOTE 3.  PRINCIPAL AND INTEREST PAYMENTS

In the ordinary  course,  no principal  payments  will be made on the Term Notes
until the commencement of the Wind Down Period. During the Revolving Period, the
Trust will make payments of principal on, or  additional  borrowings  (up to the
Maximum Revolver Balance) under, the Revolving Notes on a daily basis.

The  then-unpaid  principal  balance of the Term  Notes,  Revolving  Notes,  and
Certificates will be payable on August 15, 2000.

Payments of  interest on the  existing  Notes and  Certificates  are made on the
fifteenth  day of each month or, if any such day is not a Business  Day,  on the
next  succeeding  Business  Day,  (each,  a  "Distribution  Date"),   commencing
September 15, 1995 (the "Initial Distribution Date").

The Term Notes  interest  rate equals  LIBOR plus 13 basis  points per annum for
each  Distribution  Date.  Interest  on the Term Notes  will  accrue  from,  and
including,  the most recent  Distribution  Date to, but  excluding,  the current
Distribution Date. The Term Noteholders  received interest at a weighted average
rate of 5.990 percent per annum from August 22, 1995 through December 14, 1995.

                                      II-12

                             NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS


NOTE 3. PRINCIPAL AND INTEREST PAYMENTS (concluded)

The  Revolving  Notes  interest rate equals LIBOR plus 28 basis points per annum
for each  Distribution  Date.  Interest on the  Revolving  Notes  accrue for the
Collection Period (calendar month) immediately preceding each Distribution Date.
The Revolving  Noteholders received interest at a weighted average rate of 6.112
percent per annum from August 22, 1995 through November 30, 1995.

The  Certificates  interest rate equals LIBOR plus 30 basis points per annum for
each  Distribution  Date.  Interest  on  the  Certificates   accrues  from,  and
including,  the most recent  Distribution  Date to, but  excluding,  the current
Distribution  Date.  The  Certificateholders  received  interest  at a  weighted
average rate of 6.160  percent per annum from August 22, 1995  through  December
14, 1995. The final scheduled  distribution  date for the Certificates is August
15, 2000.


NOTE 4. DERIVATIVE FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS AND RISK MANAGEMENT

The Trust is a party to an interest  rate basis swap  contract  with an embedded
interest rate floor and a termination option to manage exposure to interest rate
fluctuations.  The interest rate basis swap,  which relates to the  Asset-Backed
Term Notes and the Asset-Backed Certificates, is a contractual agreement between
the Trust and GMAC to exchange  floating  interest rate payments (i.e. the Trust
pays Prime and receives  London  Interbank  Offering Rate (LIBOR) plus 294 basis
points). The embedded floor, which relates to the Asset-Backed  Revolving Notes,
provides the Trust with monthly cash  settlements  from GMAC for an amount equal
to the excess,  if any,  of the One Month LIBOR rate plus 150 basis  points over
the Prime rate. In addition, the interest rate basis swap will terminate at the
time the outstanding principal balance of the Revolving and Term Notes and the
Certificates has been paid in full.  In the event that GMAC gives notice that it
has elected not to extend the revolving period of the sale transaction, the
notional amount of the interest rate basis swap would amortize at the same rate
as the outstanding balance of the related debt and equity obligations.

Market risk is mitigated  because the  derivatives are used to hedge a portfolio
of underlying  debt and equity obligations.  Credit risk of the instruments is
limited to payments due from GMAC.  If GMAC had  defaulted,  the potential
benefit (cost) to the Trust, if the positions were replaced at market rates in
effect at December 31, 1995, would have been as follows:

                                                   1995
                                         (in millions of dollars)
       Interest Rate Basis Swap                  $  4.5
       Interest Rate Floor                           .1
       Termination Option                          (5.4)
                                                 $ ( .8)

The  notional  amount of the  interest  rate basis swap  including  the embedded
interest rate floor and termination option  approximates the outstanding balance
in the Asset-Backed Notes and Asset-Backed Certificates.

                                      II-13

NOTE 5. FEDERAL INCOME TAX

The Trust is  classified  as a  partnership,  and  therefore is not taxable as a
corporation   for   federal   income   tax   purposes.   Each   Noteholder   and
Certificateholder,  by acceptance of a Note or Certificate,  agrees to treat the
Note as indebtedness  and the Certificate as an equity interest in the Trust for
federal, state and local income and franchise tax purposes.
