ITEM 1.   BUSINESS

          The Company is a specialty niche supplemental staffing company focused
in the areas of information services ("IS"),  technology,  office automation and
medical  office  support.  It  provides  services  to  businesses,   educational
institutions,  professional and service organizations,  federal, state and local
governmental agencies and others in the United States. The Company also supplies
payroll,  billing and/or financial support services to independent  supplemental
staffing  firms  (the  "Associated  Offices"),   provides  temporary  laboratory
staffing  support  to  the  scientific   community  and  provides   confidential
consulting and payrolling,  permitting clients to utilize the services of former
1099 independent contractors and consultants.

          Uniforce(R)  assists  clients  in  meeting  peak  workloads,  handling
special   projects,   overcoming   personnel   shortages  and  solving  staffing
emergencies  by  supplying  them with a  supplemental  work force.  Supplemental
staffing  assignments  range in  duration  from days and  weeks to many  months.
Planned use of  supplemental  staffing  affords  economies  and  flexibility  to
clients  by  permitting  the  hiring of only  such  permanent  employees  as are
required for the basic day-to-day workload. As clients pay only for actual hours
worked by supplemental  staff, the cost of such personnel is directly related to
production and work flow.  Use of services  provided by the Company on a routine
basis also eliminates or reduces clients' recordkeeping, payroll tax, insurance,
benefits, hiring, training and turnover costs.


                                       -1-

<PAGE>
          A   subsidiary   of   Uniforce,   trading  as   Uniforce   Information
Services/Brannon & Tully,  places specialized IS professionals on a supplemental
staffing basis. PrO Unlimited,  Inc. ("PrO Unlimited(TM)") provides confidential
employee conversion and consulting services enabling client companies to utilize
the services of former 1099 independent  contractors and  consultants.  Employee
conversion results in the employment of former 1099 independent  contractors and
consultants  by PrO  Unlimited  and the  assignment  of these persons to work as
supplemental  staffers for clients of PrO Unlimited.  LabForce of America,  Inc.
("LabForce(R)")   provides   laboratory   professionals,   including   chemists,
biologists,  engineers and other supplemental  scientific support personnel to a
broad range of industries.

          Temporary Help Industry Servicing Company, Inc.  ("THISCO(R)") and its
subsidiary, Brentwood Service Group(R), Inc. ("Brentwood"), provide confidential
financing  and perform  certain  payroll,  billing and back office  services for
Associated  Offices.  These functions are performed under contract for a service
charge.

          At March 1, 1996,  Uniforce Licensees operated 36 licensed offices and
Uniforce operated 14 Company-owned  offices,  LabForce operated 12 offices,  PrO
Unlimited 6 offices and  Uniforce  Information  Services 4 offices.  Some of the
LabForce and PrO Unlimited  offices occupied space shared with Uniforce offices.
At that date, THISCO and Brentwood serviced 124 Associated  Offices. In addition
to its Headquarters (which will be relocated to Woodbury, New York from New Hyde
Park, New York in April 1996), the


                                       -2-
<PAGE>
Company  maintains a Southeastern  Regional office in Boca Raton,  Florida and a
Midwestern  Regional  Office in  Overland  Park,  Missouri.  These  offices  are
responsible for the Company's  operations in these areas and,  together with the
Headquarters  office,  the  servicing  of Uniforce  licensed  and  Company-owned
offices.  The Company also maintains an  Administrative  and Operating Office in
Cleveland,  Tennessee,  which  is  responsible  for  servicing  the  clients  of
Brentwood, and an Operating Office in Atlanta, Georgia, which is responsible for
servicing  the IS  clients of  Uniforce  Information  Services/Brannon  & Tully.
References  herein to "Uniforce" are references to Uniforce  Staffing  Services,
Inc. and its  Licensees.  References to the "Company" are references to Uniforce
Services, Inc. and its subsidiaries.

UNIFORCE

          Uniforce  offices  furnish  a  variety  of  skilled  and  semi-skilled
supplemental staffing services in the categories described below.

          In 1995,  general and automated  office,  technical  and  professional
services  accounted for approximately 81% of the total revenues derived from the
sale of supplemental staffing services,  and light industrial services accounted
for approximately 19% of such revenues.

          Uniforce  obtains clients through the efforts of the Company's and its
Licensees'  own sales  personnel,  direct mail  solicitation  and referrals from
other clients. The Company also


                                       -3-
<PAGE>
administers  public  relations  programs  and  advertising  campaigns  using the
slogans,  "Workstyles  To Fit Your  Lifestyle(R),"  "Always  There When You Need
Us(TM),"  "Your  Search  for  Excellence  is  Over!(R),"  "Work When You Want To
Work(R),"   "Get  Ahead  in  Style(R),"   "The   Productivity   People(R)"   and
"Productivity Through People(R)."  Supplemental staffers are recruited primarily
through  local media  advertising  and through  referrals  from other  temporary
staffers.

          Although  the Company  does not  consider its business to be seasonal,
the  number  of  days  worked  by  certain   supplemental   staffing  personnel,
principally  in light  industrial  tasks,  and  resultant  revenues  varies from
quarter to quarter, as a result of holidays and adverse weather conditions.

         INFORMATION SERVICES AND TECHNICAL SERVICES

          Uniforce furnishes highly skilled Information Technology professionals
as  consultants,   programmers,  systems  analysts,  project  managers,  network
specialists  and  software  engineers  as well as in various  other  specialized
capacities to a variety of industries.

          The Company  supplies  various levels of skilled  workers for Computer
Aided Drafting and Design (CAD),  Computer Aided Manufacturing (CAM),  drafting,
design,  electronic  component  assembly,  wiring and soldering to high-tech and
manufacturing.

         AUTOMATED OFFICE SERVICES

          These Uniforce temporary staffers are skilled  individuals who perform
word processing, data processing, data entry and personal computer operations.


                                       -4-
<PAGE>
         GENERAL OFFICE SERVICES

          Uniforce   temporary   staffers   perform  as  secretaries,   typists,
receptionists,  clerical assistants and records management clerks, as well as in
other general office categories.

         MEDICAL OFFICE SUPPORT

          Uniforce  provides  supplemental  staffers for general  medical office
support functions that include,  but are not limited to,  secretarial,  payroll,
medical billing, medical transcribing and general clerical functions.

         MARKETING

          Uniforce  supplemental  staffers  assist  in  product   demonstration,
telemarketing  and new product  sampling,  and provide  general staff support at
trade shows and conventions.

         LEGAL AND ACCOUNTING

          Uniforce  legal  staffers   serve  as  legal   secretaries/   typists,
paralegals,  law clerks,  librarians and in other law- related  areas.  Uniforce
provides  supplemental  staffers  for  general  accounting  services  and  other
finance-related  tasks,  such  as  bookkeeping,  recordkeeping  and  credit  and
collection.

         LIGHT INDUSTRIAL

          Uniforce   provides  both  skilled  and   semi-skilled   employees  to
supplement its clients' regular work forces in manufacturing plants, warehouses,

and hospitality services.

LICENSED OFFICES

          Licensees  have the  exclusive  right to open and maintain one or more
offices  within a  designated  territory,  using the  Uniforce  name and service
marks, and the "Uniforce System,"  consisting of marketing  programs,  operating
methods,  forms,  advertising and promotional  materials.  Company-owned  branch
offices and licensed offices are generally not operated in the same territory.

          All new Licensees  receive initial training at the Company's  training
center,  supplemented by written and videotaped  training  materials used at the
Licensees' offices. Thereafter, ongoing advisory service and support is provided
to each office by the Company's Headquarters and Regional Headquarters staff.

          Licensees recruit supplemental  staffers and promote their services to
both existing and new clients obtained through the Licensees' marketing efforts.
Performance  of the  supplemental  staffers and overall  service  quality is the
direct responsibility of Licensees.  As they are ultimately  responsible for the
collection of accounts  receivable,  Licensees must conform to strict credit and
collection practices structured by the Company.

          The  Company  and its  Licensees  share  the gross  profits  from each
Uniforce office.  Licensing agreements have a perpetual term. However,  Uniforce
may  terminate  a  license  for  material  breach  by a  Licensee  or for  other
significant good cause as prescribed in the agreements. In addition, at any time
after 18 months, a Licensee (other than one granted a license under the


                                       -6-
<PAGE>
Affiliation  Licensing  Program) may surrender the license and withdraw from the
supplemental  staffing  service  business in the  territory  or, upon payment to
Uniforce of an amount based on a predetermined formula,  assume and continue the
operation of the business  independently of Uniforce,  the Uniforce name and the
Uniforce System.  Affiliation  Licensing Program  Licensees  generally must wait
five or 10 years from  commencement of operations under the Uniforce name before
exercising this option.  In either event,  if a Licensee  exercises this option,
the Company may then license a new office or operate a  Company-owned  office in
the territory.

          The Company grants licenses to operate  Uniforce  Services offices and
presently offers several different licensing programs. Under the first, licenses
are granted to  individuals  who, with the  assistance of the Company,  open new
supplemental  staffing offices.  The second is the Company's  Regional Licensing
Program,  under which qualified Licensees agree to open and operate at least two
Uniforce  offices in different  areas over a  predetermined  period of time. The
third  is  the  Company's  Affiliation   Licensing  Program,   which  integrates
established independent  supplemental staffing services into the Uniforce system
and includes an inducement  payment to qualified  candidates.  The fourth is the
Uni-Free(TM)  Start-Up Program,  which is available to experienced  supplemental
staffing service executives.  Under this last program,  Uniforce does not charge
an initial  license fee and offers  limited  financial  assistance  to qualified
Licensees.

BRANNON & TULLY/UNIFORCE INFORMATION SERVICES

          These highly skilled  professionals  perform as  programmers,  systems
analysts,  technical writers, database analysts,  project managers,  application
developers,  software  engineers,  and  LAN/WAN  (Local Area  Network/Wide  Area
Network)  specialists.  In 1995,  the  Company  began  using  the name  Uniforce
Information Services to designate services provided by this subsidiary.

LABFORCE

          LabForce  provides  supplemental  scientific  staffing  support to the
scientific  community.  Uniforce  offices are also given the opportunity to sell
this product line.  LabForce provides services  nationwide to companies involved
in pharmaceutical,  environmental,  biotech and processing businesses.  LabForce
staffers  include highly  specialized  professional  chemists,  biologists,  lab
instrumentation operators and technicians.

PRO UNLIMITED

          PrO Unlimited  provides  consulting and conversion  services to client
companies that require  assistance in complying with  regulations  regarding the
use of 1099  independent  contractors  and returning  retirees.  Using its SCORE
1099(TM)  software  system,  it  offers  client  companies  consulting  services
incorporating a proprietary liability and risk scoring system to assess the


                                       -8-
<PAGE>
likelihood  of a  client's  independent  contractor  being  reclassified  as  an
employee by a governmental authority.

THISCO/BRENTWOOD

          THISCO  and  Brentwood  offer  unlimited  supplemental  staff  payroll
financing  and/or total back office services to Associated  Offices.  THISCO and
Brentwood's  back office  services  include the providing of various  management
reports and analysis,  payment of all federal, state and local payroll taxes and
preparation  and filing of  quarterly  and annual  payroll  tax  returns for the
temporary staffers placed by independently owned Associated Offices.  Customized
paychecks and invoices are provided to the clients of the Associated  Offices in
the name of the  Associated  Office.  Clients of the  Associated  Offices  remit
payment to the Company.

SUPPORT SERVICES

          The  Company's   Headquarters  is  staffed  by  a  team  of  personnel
professionals  who provide various support  services to Licensees,  their staffs
and supplemental  staffers,  and to the various  subsidiaries of the Company and
Associated  Offices.  The Company  maintains an accounting  and data  processing
service center that prepares  supplemental  staffer payrolls and client billing,
assists in accounts receivable collection and furnishes computerized  management
information  and analysis to Uniforce  offices,  Company  clients and Associated
Offices. Licensees are


                                       -9-
<PAGE>

assigned a Field  Service  Representative  to  provide  on-site  and  telephonic
assistance in developing  the office to its full  potential.  Licensees,  and in
some instances,  their in-house staff members, receive training at the Company's
training center. In addition,  periodic seminars are conducted for Licensees and
managers.  The Company  provides  ongoing  training,  orientation and bi-monthly
topical video update programs that are  distributed to all Uniforce  offices for
use by in-house and supplemental  staffers.  The Company's Marketing  Department
prepares and distributes programs and promotional literature designed to attract
and educate clients to the benefits of using Uniforce,  LabForce, PrO Unlimited,
THISCO and Brentwood  services and to recruit  personnel for such  subsidiaries.
The  Company  maintains  various  regional   administrative  and  sales  offices
throughout  the country that seek new  Licensees to expand the Uniforce  network
and new clients  for the  services of Brannon & Tully,  THISCO,  Brentwood,  PrO
Unlimited and LabForce.

EMPLOYEES

          The  Company   currently  has   approximately  200  employees  at  its
Headquarters,  its  Regional  Headquarters,  Company-owned  offices  and  in the
offices of its various subsidiaries.  Licensees' offices generally employ two to
four in-house  employees,  depending  upon the size of the office.  Supplemental
staffers may be employed and paid by the Company or by Licensees, depending upon
arrangements with each Licensee. All employees of the Company are covered by


                                      -10-
<PAGE>
workers'  compensation and general  liability  insurance and by a fidelity bond.
The Company encourages long term  relationships  with its supplemental  staffers
through  their  participation  in its 401(k)  plan.  During  1995,  the Company,
Uniforce,  its  Licensees,  PrO Unlimited,  LabForce and the Associated  Offices
provided supplemental staffing services of approximately 74,000 persons.

COMPETITION

          The supplemental staffing industry is highly competitive.  Competition
is  encountered  from  national,   regional  and  local  personnel  services  in
attracting licensees,  employees and clients. Certain national temporary service
companies, such as Kelly Services, Inc., Olsten Corporation,  Manpower, Inc. and
Adia  Services,  Inc.,  are  substantially  larger in size than the  Company and
possess substantially greater operational, financial and personnel resources.

          The Company  believes that its initial and ongoing  training  program,
focused  on  the  Licensee,   its  in-house   staff  and  staffers   located  at
Company-owned facilities, has helped it achieve significant results in the past.
No assurance can be given that this will continue to be the case.

          The Company  believes  that niche  marketing,  quality  service,  high
caliber professional  temporary employees,  proper pricing, value added services
and the range of services  offered by it are the principal  competitive  factors
that enable it to compete


                                      -11-
<PAGE>
effectively  within  local  markets.  The Company  views its rate  structure  as
competitive with those of others in the industry.

          PrO Unlimited has principally  regional or local  competition  with no
one company directly competing against it in the national marketplace.  LabForce
has as its principal  competitor Lab Support,  Inc. In financial and back office
support services, the Company's principal competitors are Career Horizons, Inc.,
Damian  Services  Corporation  and  TempFunds  America,  Inc.  Brannon & Tully's
competes both with national and regional providers of IS professionals.

          While  the  Company  has  experienced  competitive  pressures  in  its
business,  it believes that being a national  provider with centralized  support
services has enabled it to distribute the costs  associated  with its businesses
among its Licensees, Company-owned facilities and Associated Offices.

GOVERNMENTAL REGULATION

          The primary  business  of the  Company is not subject to  governmental
regulation.  The sale of  franchises  or licenses,  however,  is subject to such
regulation,  both by the Federal Trade  Commission  and a number of states.  The
Company  believes that it is in  compliance  with all material  requirements  of
Federal and state laws applicable to the sale of franchises or licenses in those
states in which it has engaged in marketing licenses.

share,  net to the seller in cash. An aggregate of 1,401,080 Shares was tendered
pursuant  to  the  Offer,   which   provided  for  proration  in  the  event  of
oversubscription.   On  Wednesday,  January  10,  1996,  the  Company  purchased
1,250,000 Shares for aggregate consideration of $14,062,500, which, after giving
effect to certain  costs and  expenses of the Offer,  resulted in a reduction of

ITEM 3.  LEGAL PROCEEDINGS.

NCCI ET AL. V. UNIFORCE TEMPORARY PERSONNEL, INC., ET AL.

          On April 26, 1994, National Council on Compensation  Insurance,  Inc.,
National Workers  Compensation  Insurance,  Inc., National Workers  Compensation
Reinsurance Pool,  Insurance Company of North America,  The Travelers  Insurance
Company  and  Liberty  Mutual  Insurance   Company   (collectively,   the  "NCCI
Plaintiffs")  filed an action in the Circuit Court,  Palm Beach County,  Florida
(the "Circuit  Court") against the Company,  certain of its  subsidiaries,  John
Fanning,  Rosemary  Maniscalco and Harry Maccarrone,  executive  officers of the
Company,  and other unrelated parties. In June 1994 the NCCI Plaintiffs filed an
amended complaint in the action and in October 1995 a second amended  complaint.
In the second amended  complaint,  the NCCI Plaintiffs added several  defendants
including Gordon Robinett, a director of

                                      -15-
<PAGE>
the  Company  and  the  Company's  former  Vice-President  of  Finance,  and the
Company's  independent  public  auditors.  The NCCI Plaintiffs  allege causes of
action for breach of contracts of insurance,  negligence,  fraud,  conspiracy to
defraud, and fraudulent inducement. The NCCI Plaintiffs allege that by virtue of
the manner in which the Company  conducted  its  business,  the Company  secured
workers'  compensation  coverage for its temporary  employees at premiums  below
those that should have been paid. The NCCI Plaintiffs seek an audit,  accounting
and damages in an unspecified amount not less than $11,500,000.

          At a regularly  scheduled case management  conference held on February
23, 1996, the Circuit Court ordered that if the NCCI Plaintiffs  elect to file a
third amended complaint,  they must do so on or before May 17, 1996. Thereafter,
the Circuit Court will consider motions to dismiss the complaint.

          Discovery  is now ongoing.  The Company  denies the claims of the NCCI
Plaintiffs  and believes that it has  substantial  defenses,  counterclaims  and
setoffs thereto.

          In June 1994, the Company and Uniforce  Services,  Inc. (the "Uniforce
Plaintiffs")  filed an  action  in the  United  States  District  Court  for the
Southern  District of Florida,  West Palm Beach  Division,  against the National
Council  on  Compensation   Insurance,   the  National   Workers'   Compensation
Reinsurance  Pool  and  others  (the  "NCCI  Defendants").  The  action  alleged
monopolization,  attempts to monopolize,  restraint of trade,  conspiracy on the
part of the NCCI Defendants, as well as violation of the constitutional


                                      -16-
<PAGE>
rights of the Uniforce  Plaintiffs.  The complaint  sought treble  damages in an
unspecified  amount.  The NCCI Defendants  filed an answer in the action denying
its allegations and setting forth affirmative  defenses,  and filed a motion for
summary  judgment  addressing  the  antitrust  issues  pleaded  by the  Uniforce
Plaintiffs,  which motion was subsequently granted by the court. The Company has
appealed the judgment which, upon advice of counsel, it believed to be erroneous
as a matter of law.  Oral  argument  of the  appeal  was  heard by the  Eleventh
Circuit  Court of Appeals  on March 11,  1996 and the  matter is  currently  sub
judice.

          In June 1994,  various  subsidiaries of the Company filed an action in
the New York Supreme  Court,  Nassau  County,  against  Liberty Mutual Ins. Co.,
Insurance  Company  of  North  American  a/k/a  CIGNA  and The  Travelers  Corp.
insurance  companies.  The action alleges  mismanagement  by the carriers of the
plaintiffs'  workers'   compensation  programs  and  seeks  unspecified  damages
aggregating  approximately  $10,000,000.  The defendants have filed an answer in
the action denying its allegations and setting forth affirmative  defenses.  The
parties are currently conducting discovery.

          Management  believes  that the ultimate  outcome of these actions will
not have a material adverse effect upon the financial position of the Company.

1995 COMPARED TO 1994

          Total  revenues  increased  by  16.7%  from  $115,180,734  in  1994 to
$134,471,332,  in 1995.  Sales of supplemental  staffing  services  increased by
16.4% or  $17,781,850  in 1995 as compared  to 1994.  These  increases  resulted
principally  from the Company's  acquisition  in April 1994 of certain assets of
Brannon & Tully, Inc., a provider of IS contract professionals. This company now
operates under the trade name of Brannon & Tully/Uniforce  Information Services.
This  acquisition  contributed  $25,528,957  of  sales  in 1995 as  compared  to
$12,445,869  for the period  from April 18,  1994 to  December  31,  1994.  This
acquisition  has had a favorable  impact on the Company's  results of operations
and its ability to develop  higher margin  professional  services.  Sales by the
Company's  subsidiaries,  PrO  Unlimited,  and  to  a  lesser  degree  LabForce,
continued to increase as the Company emphasized the marketing of these services.
The sales of PrO Unlimited increased by $9,915,331 in 1995 as compared to 1994.

          The Company's  strategy is to expand through the development of higher
margin professional  services such as IS, technical,  automated office and other
professional  support services as well as through its PrO Unlimited and LabForce
subsidiaries,  while  continuing  to reduce the  percentage of its sales derived
from light industrial assignments.  In addition, the Company intends to continue
to pursue acquisitions of established independent  supplemental staffing service
companies that offer specialty services.

          Service  revenues and fees increased by 22.5% from  $6,694,742 in 1994
to $8,203,490 in 1995. Service revenues and fees generated


                                      -23-
<PAGE>
by THISCO and Brentwood  increased by $1,015,084 in 1995 compared to 1994.  Also
contributing to this increase were certain  licensee  service  revenues and fees
which increased by $493,664 in 1995 as compared to 1994.

          In addition,  system-wide  sales,  which  include  sales of Associated
Offices serviced by THISCO and Brentwood,  increased by 22.9%, from $249,758,846
in 1994 to  $307,068,836 in 1995. The Company intends to continue to expand this
portion of its business through THISCO and Brentwood.

          Cost  of  supplemental   staffing  services  was  77.7%  of  sales  of
supplemental  staffing  services  during 1995 as compared to 77.2% in 1994.  The
higher  percentage in 1995 was the result of increased  sales by PrO  Unlimited,
which have a high percentage of payroll expense in relation to sales.

          Licensees'  share  of  gross  margin  is  principally   based  upon  a
percentage of the gross margin  generated  from sales by licensed  offices.  The
gross  margin  from  sales  of  supplemental   staffing   services  amounted  to
$28,105,271 and $24,719,266 for 1995 and 1994, respectively. Licensees' share of
gross margin was 33.7% for 1995 as compared to 40.0% in 1994. The lower share as
a percentage  of gross margin in 1995 is due, in part, to the sales of Brannon &
Tully/Uniforce  Information  Services  for which  there are no related  Licensee
distributions, and to PrO Unlimited for which there are limited distributions.

          General and  administrative  expenses increased by 23.6% or $3,719,790
in  1995  as  compared  to  1994.  As a  percentage  of  revenues,  general  and
administrative  expenses  were 14.5% and 13.7% for 1995 and 1994,  respectively.
These increases resulted


                                      -24-
<PAGE>
principally from  compensation and overhead  expenses  relating to the Brannon &
Tully/Uniforce  Information  Services  operations.  Further  contributing to the
increase  were  higher  expenses  relating  to  payroll  costs  with  respect to
permanent staff offset by savings in staff  recruiting costs and increased legal
fees  relating to the  litigation  described  in Item 3. Legal  Proceedings.  In
addition, the provision for possible losses on receivables, notes receivable and
other assets increased in 1995 as compared to 1994.

          Net interest  expense  increased by $600,602 during 1995. The increase
in 1995 as compared to 1994 is a direct result of increased  borrowings used for
the  acquisition  of  Brannon  &  Tully,   Inc.  and  to  meet  working  capital
requirements due to the increased system-wide sales.

          There was no material  difference in the effective  income tax rate in
1995 as compared to 1994.

          As a result of the factors discussed above, net earnings  increased by
20.8% from $2,950,751 in 1994 to $3,563,393 in 1995.

1994 COMPARED TO 1993

          Total  revenues  increased  by  33.7%  from  $86,142,004  in  1993  to
$115,180,734 in 1994. Sales of supplemental staffing services increased by 32.6%
or $26,667,792 in 1994 as compared to 1993. These increases,  in part,  resulted
from an  improvement  in general  economic  conditions  favorably  affecting the
supplemental  staffing industry and the Company.  As a result, same office sales
increased during the current periods  compared to last year. In addition,  sales
by the Company's subsidiaries,  PrO Unlimited and LabForce continued to increase
as the Company emphasized the marketing of


                                      -25-
<PAGE>
these services.  Further contributing to the increase in sales was the Company's
acquisition in April 1994 of certain assets of Brannon & Tully, Inc., a provider
of Information  Services contract  professionals.  This acquisition  contributed
$12,445,869 of sales since April 18, 1994 and has had a favorable  impact on the
Company's  results  of  operations  and its  ability to  develop  higher  margin
professional services.

          The Company's  strategy is to expand through the development of higher
margin professional  services such as IS, technical,  automated office and other
professional  support services as well as through its PrO Unlimited and LabForce
subsidiaries,  while  continuing  to reduce the  percentage of its sales derived
from light industrial assignments.  In addition, the Company intends to continue
to pursue acquisitions of established independent  supplemental staffing service
companies.

          Service revenues and fees increased by 54.8% or $2,370,938 as compared
to 1993. This reflects increased service revenues and fees generated by existing
and new clients of THISCO and Brentwood,  two of the Company's subsidiaries.  In
addition,  system-wide sales, which include sales of associated offices serviced
by THISCO  and  Brentwood  increased  by  46.5%,  from  $170,491,415  in 1993 to
$249,758,846  in 1994. The Company intends to continue to expand this portion of
its business through THISCO and Brentwood.

          Cost  of  supplemental   staffing  services  was  77.2%  of  sales  of
supplemental staffing services during 1994 as compared to 77.6% during 1993. The
lower percentage in 1994 was the result of the acquisition of Brannon & Tully in
April 1994, which has a


                                      -26-
<PAGE>
relatively  high  gross  margin,  offset  by  PrO  Unlimited  which  has a  high
percentage of payroll expense in relation to sales.

          Licensees'  share  of  gross  margin  is  principally   based  upon  a
percentage of the gross margin  generated  from sales by licensed  offices.  The
gross  margin  from  sales  of  supplemental   staffing   services  amounted  to
$24,719,266 and $18,328,712 for 1994 and 1993, respectively. Licensees' share of
gross margin was 40.0% for 1994 as compared to 48.0% in 1993. The lower share as
a percentage of gross margin in 1994 is due, in part, to a higher level of sales
relating  to  Company-owned  offices  for which  there are no  related  Licensee
distributions, and to PrO Unlimited for which there are limited distributions.

          General and  administrative  expenses increased by 47.6% or $5,074,519
in  1994  as  compared  to  1993.  As a  percentage  of  revenues,  general  and
administrative  expenses  were 13.7% and 12.4% for 1994 and 1993,  respectively.
These increases  resulted  principally from expenses relating to the acquisition
of Brannon & Tully and growth experienced at PrO Unlimited and LabForce. Further
contributing  to the  increase  were  higher  expenses  relating  to payroll and
recruiting costs with respect to permanent staff.

          Net interest income (expense)  decreased by $277,872 during 1994. This
decrease  was a result of interest  income on notes  receivable  from  Licensees
being  more than  offset by higher  interest  expense on the  Company's  working
capital credit facility and loan  agreement.  A portion of these loan facilities
were utilized in April 1994 for the  acquisition  of certain assets of Brannon &
Tully.


                                      -27-
<PAGE>
          There was no material  difference in the effective  income tax rate in
1994 as compared to 1993.

          As a result of the factors discussed above, net earnings  increased by
97.6% from $1,493,121 in 1993 to $2,950,751 in 1994.

FINANCIAL CONDITION

          As of December 31, 1995, the Company's  working  capital  increased to
$29,180,891,  as compared to $19,281,230 at December 31, 1994. This increase was
due  primarily to the  continued  profitable  operations  of the Company and the
incurrence  of  long-term  borrowings  under the new Credit  Facility  described
below, which were used to repay short-term  borrowings under the Company's prior
credit  facilities.  These  factors were offset by the  Company's  repurchase of
shares of its Common Stock,  the  acquisition of fixed assets and the payment of
the cash dividends. Funding and service fees receivables increased by $6,451,758
to $20,918,753  during 1995.  This increase is due  principally to the increased
service revenues and fees generated by THISCO and Brentwood.

          During 1995,  the Company paid  quarterly  cash dividends on shares of
its Common  Stock at the  quarterly  rate of $.03 per share for the first  three
quarters.  Subsequent  to December 31, 1995,  the Board of Directors  declared a
quarterly  cash  dividend of $.03 per share for the quarter  ended  December 31,
1995,  which was paid on  February  13, 1996 to holders of record on February 5,
1996.

          On  December  8, 1995,  the  Company  entered in an  agreement  with a
financial  institution  creating a three-year  $35,000,000  credit facility (the
"Credit  Facility").  The Credit Facility comprises a term loan in the amount of
$3,000,000 (the "Term Loan") to be paid


                                      -28-


<PAGE>
in monthly  installments  of $62,500 in 1996,  $83,333 in 1997 and  $104,167  in
1998,  with the balance  outstanding  due on December 1, 1998, and a $32,000,000
revolving credit facility (the "Revolving Facility"),  which expires on December
1, 1998.  The Company may borrow  against  the  Revolving  Facility up to 85% of
eligible  accounts  receivable and eligible service and funding fees receivable.
The Term Loan bears  interest at the  Company's  election at either the lender's
floating  base rate plus .25%,  or LIBOR  (London  Interbank  Offered Rate) plus
2.25%.  Borrowings  under the Revolving  Facility bear interest at the Company's
election  at either  the  lender's  floating  base rate,  or LIBOR plus  2.125%.
Borrowings  under the Credit  Facility are secured by a first priority  security
interest  in all owned and  after-acquired  real and  personal  property  of the
Company.

          At  December  31,  1995,  the Company had  outstanding  borrowings  of
$3,000,000  under the Term Loan bearing  interest at an average rate of 8.0% and
$9,000,000 of borrowings  under the Revolving  Facility  bearing  interest at an
average rate of 8.1%.

          The Credit  Facility  contains a variety of  affirmative  and negative
covenants of types customary in an asset-based lending facility, including those
relating to  reporting  requirements,  maintenance  of records,  properties  and
corporate existence,  compliance with laws, incurrence of other indebtedness and
liens,  restrictions  on certain  payments and  transactions  and  extraordinary
corporate events. The Credit Facility also contains financial covenants relating
to maintenance of levels of minimal tangible net worth,  EBITDA (earnings before
interest,  taxes,  depreciation and  amortization),  net income and fixed charge
coverage and restricting


                                      -29-
<PAGE>
the amount of capital  expenditures.  In addition,  the Credit Facility contains
certain events of default of types customary in an asset-based lending facility.
Generally, if the Credit Facility is terminated (i) during the first nine months
of its term,  a fee of 1% of the amount  thereof is payable,  or (ii) during the
succeeding  nine  months  of its term,  a fee of .5% of the  amount  thereof  is
payable. The Company was in compliance with all covenants at December 31, 1995.

          Prior to December 8, 1995, the Company had maintained  with two banks,
a working capital credit facility and a revolving credit and term loan facility.
Amounts outstanding under these facilities were repaid with borrowings available
under the Credit Facility.

          In January  1996,  the  Company  successfully  completed  its offer to
purchase 1,250,000 shares of its common stock at $11.25 net per share. The total
amount  required to purchase such shares was  $14,062,500,  exclusive of related
fees and other  expenses.  The purchase  price and related  expenses were funded
with  borrowings  available  under  the  Credit  Facility.  As a  result  of the
transaction,  the  Company's  stockholders  equity was reduced by  approximately
$14,160,000 subsequent to year-end.

          The Company is moving its corporate  headquarters  in April 1996.  The
cost of the move,  including  purchases of fixed assets,  will be  approximately
$800,000 and will be financed from cash flow from  operations and financing from
the Credit Facility.  The Company  believes that internally  generated cash flow
and funding from the Credit Facility will be adequate to meet current  operating
requirements.  The Company  intends to expand its  business  through the further
development of higher margin professional services as


                                      -30-
<PAGE>
well as through PrO Unlimited and Brannon & Tully/Uniforce Information Services.
Additionally,  the Company  continues  to pursue  expansion  by  acquisition  of
established  independent  supplemental  staffing  service  companies  that offer
specialty services. The Company anticipates that internal expansion will also be
financed from its cash flow and available  borrowings under the Credit Facility.
The magnitude of future acquisitions will determine whether they can be financed
in the same manner or whether  additional  external sources of financing will be
required.  While the Company  believes  that such sources  would be available on
terms satisfactory to it, there can be no assurance in this regard.

          In October  1995,  the  Financial  Accounting  Standards  Board (FASB)
issued Statement No. 123, "Accounting for Stock-Based  Compensation," which must
be adopted by the Company in 1996.  The Company has elected not to implement the
fair value based accounting  method for employee stock options,  but has elected
to disclose  commencing  in 1996 the pro forma net income and earnings per share
as if such method had been used to account for stock- based compensation cost as
described in Statement No. 123.

                          INDEPENDENT AUDITORS' REPORT

The Board of Directors and Stockholders
Uniforce Services, Inc.:

We have  audited  the  accompanying  consolidated  balance  sheets  of  Uniforce
Services, Inc. and subsidiaries as of December 31, 1995 and 1994 and the related
consolidated  statements  of earnings,  stockholders'  equity and cash flows for
each of the years in the  three-year  period  ended  December  31,  1995.  These
consolidated  financial  statements  are  the  responsibility  of the  Company's
management.  Our  responsibility is to express an opinion on these  consolidated
financial statements based on our audits.

We  conducted  our  audits  in  accordance  with  generally   accepted  auditing
standards.  Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material
misstatement.  An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting
the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements.  An audit also includes
assessing the  accounting  principles  used and  significant  estimates  made by
management,  as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation.
We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.

In our opinion, the consolidated  financial statements referred to above present
fairly, in all material  respects,  the financial position of Uniforce Services,
Inc. and  subsidiaries  at December 31, 1995 and 1994,  and the results of their
operations and their cash flows for each of the years in the  three-year  period
ended  December  31,  1995 in  conformity  with  generally  accepted  accounting
principles.

As discussed in the notes to the consolidated financial statements,  the Company
adopted the provisions of the Financial  Accounting  Standards Board's Statement
of Financial  Accounting  Standards No. 109,  "Accounting  for Income Taxes," in
1993.

                   Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements

                        December 31, 1995, 1994 and 1993

(1)   DESCRIPTION OF BUSINESS

      Uniforce  Services,  Inc.,  together with its subsidiaries,  (the Company)
      provides  supplemental  personnel  services  to  businesses,   educational
      institutions,  professional and service organizations,  federal, state and
      local  governmental  agencies and others in the United States. The Company
      has selected  specialized product lines within several of its licensed and
      company  owned  offices  to  provide  skilled  Information  Services  (IS)
      professional  employees,  office automation specialists and medical office
      support. The Company also supplies financial,  payroll and billing support
      services to independent  supplemental  staffing services.  Subsidiaries of
      the Company  also provide  temporary  laboratory  staffing  support to the
      scientific  community;  and provide  confidential  employee conversion and
      consulting  services which enable client companies to utilize the services
      of former independent contractors and consultants.

(2)   SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

      (a)  PRINCIPLES OF CONSOLIDATION

           The  consolidated   financial  statements  include  the  accounts  of
           Uniforce   Services,   Inc.  and  its   majority   and   wholly-owned
           subsidiaries.  All significant intercompany accounts and transactions
           have been eliminated in consolidation.

      (b)  LICENSING FEES

           The Company  recognizes  revenue from initial  licensing fees when it
           has performed  substantially  all its obligations under its licensing
           agreement.

      (c)  DEPRECIATION AND AMORTIZATION

           Depreciation  and  amortization  of fixed  assets  is  computed  on a
           straight-line  method over the estimated  useful lives of the assets.
           Leasehold  improvements  are  amortized  over  the  lesser  of  their
           estimated useful lives or the respective lease periods.

           Intangible  assets,  which  include  covenants  not  to  compete  and
           territorial rights acquired, are being amortized over their estimated
           useful life  ranging  from five to ten years using the  straight-line
           method.  The  unamortized  balance is included in deferred  costs and
           other assets in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets.

                                                                     (Continued)

                                AND SUBSIDIARIES

              Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, Continued

      (d)  DEFERRED LICENSE ACQUISITION COSTS

           The Company has executed  contracts  for  affiliation  with  existing
           supplemental  staffing service companies.  Such contracts require the
           Company  to  pay  an   affiliation   fee  which  is  amortized  on  a
           straight-line  method  over  the  minimum  terms  of the  affiliation
           agreements  which are generally five or ten years.  In addition,  the
           Company has paid  similar  fees for  existing  supplemental  staffing
           service companies  acquired by the Company's  licensees.  Under these
           arrangements,  the  Company  has  agreed  to pay,  on  behalf  of its
           licensees, one-half of the acquisition cost. Such costs are amortized
           on a  straight-line  basis  over five or ten years.  Amortization  of
           deferred licensee  acquisition  costs amounted to $129,530,  $183,649
           and $216,601 in 1995, 1994 and 1993, respectively.

      (e)  INCOME TAXES

           The Company adopted Statement of Financial  Accounting  Standards No.
           109,  "Accounting  for Income  Taxes"  (Statement  109), in the first
           quarter of 1993. Statement 109 was adopted on a prospective basis and
           did not have any  impact on the  Company's  financial  statements  at
           adoption.   Deferred   income  taxes  are  recognized  for  temporary
           differences  between the financial  reporting  basis and tax basis of
           assets and liabilities.

      (f)  EARNINGS PER SHARE

           Earnings per share amounts are determined  using the weighted average
           number  of  common  shares  and  dilutive  common  share  equivalents
           (options) outstanding.

      (g)  CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS

           For purposes of presenting the consolidated statements of cash flows,
           the Company considers all highly liquid investments purchased with an
           original maturity of three months or less to be cash equivalents.

      (h)  USE OF ESTIMATES

           Management  of  the  Company  has  made a  number  of  estimates  and
           assumptions  relating to the reporting of assets and  liabilities and
           the disclosure of contingent  assets and liabilities to prepare these
           financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting
           principles. Actual results could differ from those estimates.

      (i)  FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS

           The fair values of all  financial  instruments  classified as current
           assets or liabilities  approximate  their respective  carrying values
           because of the short maturity of those instruments. The fair value of
           the Company's bank loans  approximates  book value since the interest

      (j)  RECLASSIFICATIONS

           Certain  reclassifications  have  been  made  to the  1993  and  1994
           financial statements to conform to the 1995 presentation.

(3)   ACQUISITION

      On April 18, 1994, the Company acquired certain assets of Brannon & Tully,
      Inc., a provider of IS (Information Systems) contract  professionals.  The
      purchase price totaled  $3,881,250 and consisted of $3,150,000 in cash and
      the issuance of 127,720 shares of Common Stock of the Company. Pursuant to
      a  separate   agreement,   the  Company  also  acquired  certain  accounts
      receivable,  with  recourse,  for  $1,301,595.  The  cash  portion  of the
      purchase price and the accounts  receivable acquired were financed through
      borrowings available under the Company's credit facility.

      This acquisition has been accounted for as a purchase and accordingly, the
      purchase  price was allocated to assets based on the estimated  fair value
      as of the date of the acquisition.  The excess of the  consideration  paid
      over the  estimated  fair  value  of  assets  acquired  in the  amount  of
      $3,781,925 has been recorded as cost in excess of fair value of net assets
      acquired   (goodwill)  and  is  being  amortized  over  20  years  on  the
      straight-line   method.   The  Company  assesses  the   recoverability  of
      unamortized goodwill using the undiscounted projected future earnings from
      the related businesses.

      The operating  results of Brannon & Tully,  Inc. have been included in the
      consolidated  statement of earnings from the purchase  date. The following
      unaudited  pro  forma  consolidated   results  of  operations  assume  the
      acquisition of Brannon & Tully, Inc. occurred on January 1, 1993:

                                      ============         ============


      The pro forma results of operations are not necessarily  indicative of the
      actual results of operations  that would have occurred had the acquisition
      occurred at the  beginning of the period or of results  which may occur in
      the future.

      One of the former  principals  of Brannon & Tully,  Inc.  entered  into an
      employment  agreement with the Company. His employment agreement was for a
      term of five years,  but could be  terminated  by either party at any time
      after one year, upon not less than 90 days notice.  Beginning in 1995, the
      employment  agreement  provided  for  incentive  compensation  based  upon
      improvements  in gross  profits  relating to certain  offices to which the
      officer rendered employment  services and provided active assistance.  The
      amount of incentive  compensation  earned in 1995 under the  agreement was
      $370,172. The employment agreement was terminated during 1995.

                                                                     (Continued)

      1994 and 1993, respectively.

(5)   LOAN PAYABLE

      On  December  8,  1995,  the  Company  entered  into an  agreement  with a
      financial  institution  creating a three-year  $35,000,000 credit facility
      (the "Credit Facility").  The Credit Facility comprises a term loan in the
      amount of $3,000,000 (the "Term Loan") to be paid in monthly  installments
      of $62,500 in 1996, $83,333 in 1997 and $104,167 in 1998, with the balance
      outstanding  due on December 1, 1998 and a  $32,000,000  revolving  credit
      facility (the  "Revolving  Facility")  which expires on December 1, 1998 .
      The  Company  may  borrow  against  the  Revolving  Facility  up to 85% of
      eligible  accounts  receivable  and  eligible  service  and  funding  fees
      receivable.  The Term Loan bears  interest  at the  Company's  election at
      either  the  lender's  floating  base rate  plus  .25%,  or LIBOR  (London
      Interbank  Offered  Rate)  plus  2.25%.  Borrowings  under  the  Revolving
      Facility bear  interest at the  Company's  election at either the lender's
      floating  base rate,  or LIBOR plus  2.125%.  Borrowings  under the Credit
      Facility are secured by a first  priority  security  interest in all owned
      and after-acquired real and personal property of the Company.

      At December 31, 1995, the Company had outstanding borrowings of $3,000,000
      under  the Term  Loan  bearing  interest  at an  average  rate of 8.0% and
      $9,000,000 of borrowings under the Revolving  Facility bearing interest at
      an average rate of 8.1%.

      The  Credit  Facility  contains  a variety  of  affirmative  and  negative
      covenants of types customary in an asset-based lending facility including,
      among other things, minimum net worth and profitability levels, with which
      the Company is in compliance as of December 31, 1995.

                                                                     (Continued)

              Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, Continued

      The Credit  Facility was used to repay existing  indebtedness as described
      below and to finance the offer to purchase the  Company's  common stock in
      January 1996 as described in Note 10.

      Prior to  December  8, 1995,  the Company  maintained,  with two banks,  a
      working  capital  credit  facility  and a  revolving  credit and term loan
      facility.  The working capital credit facility represented an open line of
      credit of up to  $12,000,000  (increased  from  $10,000,000,  effective in
      November 1995), borrowings under which were payable on demand. Outstanding
      borrowings  bore interest,  at the Company's  option,  at the banks' prime
      rate or at a rate 120 basis  points  above the  banks'  LIBOR  Rate.  This
      working  capital  credit  facility was  terminated on December 8, 1995. In
      addition,  the  Company  maintained  a  revolving  credit  and  term  loan
      agreement which provided for a two-year $6,000,000  facility,  outstanding
      borrowings under which, at the Company's option, could be converted at the
      maturity of the  revolving  credit  facility  into a five-year  term loan.
      Effective  November 1995, in connection with the increase in the Company's
      working capital  facility  described  above, the revolving credit and term
      loan  agreement  (under which there were no  outstanding  borrowings)  was
      terminated.

(6)   INCOME TAXES

      In  February  1992,  the  Financial   Accounting  Standards  Board  issued
      Statement  No. 109.  The  Company  had  previously  adopted  Statement  of
      Financial Accounting Standards No. 96, "Accounting for Income Taxes" which
      required the liability  approach with respect to deferred tax balances and
      the current  adjustment  for changes in statutory  tax rates.  The Company
      adopted  Statement  109,  which also requires the liability  approach with
      respect to deferred tax balances, during the first quarter of 1993.

      The  components  of the  provision  (benefit) for Federal and state income
      taxes are as follows:

                                      1995         1994         1993

(7)   EMPLOYMENT AGREEMENTS AND TRANSACTIONS

      The Company has employment  agreements with two of its officers  providing
      for, among other things,  their continued  employment through December 31,
      1996. In addition, the agreements provide for incentive compensation which
      is based  upon the  Company's  pre-tax  earnings.  Incentive  compensation
      earned  in 1995  was  $221,298  and in 1994  was  $263,677.  No  incentive
      compensation was earned in 1993.

      The  Company  previously  held a  promissory  note from an  officer of the
      Company.  This note resulted from an August 1990  transaction  whereby the
      Company  loaned the officer  $200,000 at an interest  rate of 8% which was
      fully repaid in 1993.

                                                                    (Continued)

      During 1993, the Company purchased for corporate use a condominium from an
      officer of the Company for  $152,500.  The purchase  price was based on an
      independent appraisal.

(8)   STOCK OPTIONS

      During 1991, the Board of Directors of the Company approved the 1991 Stock
      Option  Plan (the 1991 Plan)  which  provides  for the  issuance  of up to
      500,000  stock  options to officers and  employees  of the  Company.  Each
      option  granted  pursuant to the 1991 Plan shall be designated at the time
      of grant as either an  "incentive  stock  option"  or as a  "non-qualified
      stock option."

      In addition,  the Company maintains two employee stock option plans, and a
      non-qualified  stock option plan for its licensees.  The plans (except for
      options designated as non-qualified  stock options) provide for options to
      be granted at 100% of the fair market value of the Company's  common stock
      and provide that the  exercise  price of options may not be less than 110%
      of such fair market value in the case of an employee owning 10% or more of
      the voting power of the Company's  stock. At the time options are granted,
      the Company may impose a waiting  period before  options can be exercised.
      Non-qualified  stock  options  may not be  granted at less than 75% of the
      fair market value of the Company's common stock at the date of grant.

      During 1991,  non-qualified  stock  options with respect to 90,000  shares
      were  granted  under the 1991 Plan at 75% of the fair market  value of the
      Company's  common  stock on the date of the grant.  The grant  resulted in
      compensation  expense of  $180,000 to be  allocated  to current and future
      periods as earned.  Additional  paid-in  capital has been  credited to the
      extent of aggregate compensation earned since the grant of $85,500.

      In 1995 the  stockholders  of the Company  approved the  Directors'  Stock
      Option Plan (the  Directors  Plan) which permits the granting of a maximum
      of 100,000 stock options to its outside Directors. The purpose of the plan
      is to secure for the Company and its  stockholders  the  benefits  arising
      from stock ownership by its outside Directors.

                                                                    (Continued)

</TABLE>
      See Note 10 for a description of additional  options granted in connection
      with the subsequent event.

      Optionees have made  disqualifying  dispositions of common stock which had
      been acquired  through the exercise of incentive and  non-qualified  stock
      options.  As a  result  of the  disqualifying  dispositions,  the  Company
      receives a tax benefit for the difference between the option price and the
      fair  market  value  of its  common  stock.  The  benefit  in 1993 was not
      material.  The  benefit  of  $100,220  and  $152,124  in  1995  and  1994,
      respectively,   has  been  reflected  in  the  accompanying   consolidated
      statements of stockholders' equity.

      In October of 1995, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued
      Statement No. 123,  "Accounting for Stock-Based  Compensation," which must
      be  adopted  by the  Company  in 1996.  The  Company  has  elected  not to
      implement  the fair  value  based  accounting  method for  employee  stock
      options,  but has elected to disclose,  commencing in 1996,  the pro forma
      net  income  and  earnings  per share as if such  method  had been used to
      account for  stock-based  compensation  cost as described in Statement No.
      123.

(9)   COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES

      In April 1994, various prior insurance  carriers and their  not-for-profit
      trade  association  filed an action against the Company,  its officers and
      various other parties.  The Plaintiffs  allege breach of contract and tort
      causes of action for  underpayment  of premiums.  The Company's  motion to
      dismiss the action has not yet

                                                                     (Continued)

      been decided and the Company  continues to deny the validity of the claims
      of the  Plaintiffs.  Further,  the Company  intends to assert  substantial
      claims in opposition to the claims of the  Plaintiffs.  Additionally,  the
      Company and its subsidiaries have filed suit against the trade association
      alleging various  anti-trust  allegations and against various prior worker
      compensation carriers alleging claims  mismanagement.  Management believes
      that the  ultimate  outcome  of  these  matters  will not have a  material
      adverse effect upon the financial position of the Company.

      In January 1996, various vendors of training films filed an action against
      the Company. The plaintiffs allege that the Company improperly used and/or
      copied plaintiffs' tapes.  Motions have been filed to have the plaintiffs'
      claims dismissed and/or severed.  Management  intends to vigorously defend
      the claims and believes  that the claims will not have a material  adverse
      effect upon the financial position of the Company.

      The  Company is  obligated  under  various  leases  for  office  space and
      equipment  through 2000. Net rental expense for the years ended 1995, 1994
      and 1993  amounted  to  approximately  $871,000,  $734,000  and  $606,000,
      respectively.

      In  January  1996,  the  Company  entered  into a 10 year lease for 23,360
      square feet of space at $19.00 per square foot relating to the  relocation
      of its corporate headquarters.

      Following  is  a  schedule  of  total   minimum   lease   payments   under
      noncancelable  operating  leases as of December  31, 1995,  including  the
      lease entered into in January 1996:

(10) SUBSEQUENT EVENTS

      On December 11, 1995, the Company made an offer to purchase for cash up to
      1,250,000  shares of its Common Stock at $11.25 net per share (the Offer).
      The  1,250,000  shares  that the Company  offered to purchase  represented
      approximately  30% of the Shares  outstanding  as of December 11, 1995. In
      January 1996, the Offer was successfully completed.

                                                                    (Continued)

              Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, Continued

      The  total  amount   required  to  purchase  the   1,250,000   shares  was
      $14,062,500,  exclusive of related fees and other  expenses.  The purchase
      price and related expenses were funded with available borrowings under the
      Credit  Facility.  As a result of the repurchase of shares,  the Company's
      stockholders equity will be reduced by approximately $14,160,000.

      In January 1996,  the Company  entered into  arrangements  with two of its
      officers. Under such arrangements,  the executive officers are entitled to
      receive cash bonuses  aggregating  $1,041,018 payable to the extent of 10%
      thereof three years after  consummation of the Offer, to the extent of 30%
      thereof four years after  consummation  of the Offer and as to the balance
      thereof  five years after  consummation  of the Offer,  provided  that the
      recipient is then  employed by the Company.  The  executive  officers were
      granted options to purchase an aggregate of 92,535 shares of Common Stock,
      such options to vest in  installments  through  January 1999. The exercise
      price of such  options was $11.25 per share.  The cash bonus  installments
      and option installments are subject to acceleration in the event of death,
      merger of the Company,  sale of all or substantially  all of the Company's
      assets or a change of control of the Company.

                Under Section 402 of the Business Corporation Law

                  The  undersigned,  being a natural person of at least 18 years
of age and acting as the  incorporator  of the  Corporation  hereby being formed
under the Business Corporation Law of the State of New York, certifies:

                  FIRST:            The name of the Corporation shall be UTPI

CORP.

                  SECOND:           The Corporation is formed for the following
purposes:

                           To engage in any lawful act or  activity  for which a
                  corporation  may be  organized  under  the New  York  Business
                  Corporation  Law,  provided that the Corporation is not formed
                  to engage in any act or activity which requires the consent of
                  any State official, department, board, agency or other body.

                  THIRD:            The office of the Corporation shall be
located in the Town of North Hempstead, County of Nassau, State of New York.

                  FOURTH:           The aggregate number of shares which the
Corporation shall have authority to issue is 5,002,500 shares, to consist of 
5,000,000 shares, $.01 par value per share, all of which are of the same class 
and all of which are designated as

<PAGE>
common shares (the "Common  Stock") and 2,500 shares,  $.01 par value per share,
all of which are of the same class and all of which are  designated as preferred
stock (the "Preferred Stock").

                  FIFTH:            The powers, preferences, restrictions and
rights granted to or imposed on the respective classes of stock

are as follows:

                  (a) Each  share of Common  Stock  shall  have one vote for all
corporate purposes, with no cumulative voting rights.

                  (b) The Preferred  Stock shall not entitle any holder  thereof
to vote at any meeting of  shareholders  of the  Corporation,  or  otherwise  to
participate in any action taken by the Corporation or the shareholders  thereof,
whether by consent in writing or otherwise.

                  (c) The  holders  of  Preferred  Stock  shall be  entitled  to
receive  out of the  earnings  or net  profits of the  Corporation,  at the time
legally  available for the  declaration of dividends,  but only when declared by
the Board of  Directors,  noncumulative  dividends  at the rate of 5% of the par
value thereof per annum,  and no more,  payable as the Board of Directors  shall
determine,  before any  dividend  shall be set apart or paid on the Common Stock
for such year. After the full  noncumulative  dividend as aforesaid for the then
current dividend period shall have been declared,  paid or set apart for payment
to  the  holders  of  Preferred  Stock,  the  holders  of  Common  Stock  of the
Corporation  shall be  entitled  to receive,  pro rata to the  exclusion  of the

                                      -2-

<PAGE>
holders  of  Preferred  Stock,  such  dividends  as,  from time to time,  may be
declared by the Board of Directors.

                  (d)  In  the  event  of  any  liquidation,   dissolution,   or
winding-up of the Corporation,  whether voluntary or involuntary, the holders of
the  Preferred  Stock  shall be  entitled  to  receive  out of the assets of the
Corporation  available  for  distribution  to  its  shareholders,  whether  from
capital, surplus, or earnings, an amount equal to the par value of the Preferred
Stock plus all accrued and unpaid dividends thereon,  before any distribution of
the assets shall be made to the holders of the Common Stock and, thereafter, the
holders of the Common Stock shall be entitled,  to the  exclusion of the holders
of the  Preferred  Stock,  to share  ratably  in all  assets of the  Corporation
remaining  after such payment to the holders of the  Preferred  Stock.  If, upon
such  liquidation,  dissolution or winding-up of the Corporation,  the assets of
the  Corporation  shall not be  sufficient  to permit the payment in full to the
holders of the Preferred Stock of the preferential  amounts provided for herein,
then the entire assets of the Corporation shall be distributed ratably among the
holders of the Preferred Stock.  Notwithstanding  the foregoing  provisions,  no
distribution  of assets among the holders of the Preferred Stock and the holders
of the Common Stock shall be required in the event of a  consolidation,  merger,
lease or sale which does not, in fact,  result in the  liquidation or winding-up
of the Corporation or its business.

<PAGE>
                  (e) The Preferred Stock shall, at the option of the respective
holders  thereof,  be convertible into fully paid and  non-assessable  shares of
Common  Stock,  at the rate of 100  shares  of Common  Stock  for each  share of
Preferred  Stock   surrendered,   upon  surrender  to  the  Corporation  of  the
certificates of the Preferred  Stock so to be converted,  duly assigned in blank
for transfer.  Notwithstanding  the foregoing,  the Corporation shall not accept
for  conversion  any shares of the  Preferred  Stock  unless and until,  for the
twelve-month  period  commencing on the first day of the first month immediately
following  the  closing  of the  sale,  pursuant  to an  effective  registration
statement  under the  Securities  Act of 1933,  as amended,  of shares of Common
Stock (the "Public Sale"), the consolidated  earnings of the Corporation and its
subsidiaries  before (i)  deduction of or allowance or provision for taxes based

share of Common Stock on a fully-diluted basis, i.e., after giving effect to the
conversion of all shares of Preferred Stock and any other securities convertible
into  Preferred  Stock,  but  without  giving  effect  to  the  exercise  of any
over-allotment  option granted to any  underwriter in connection with the Public
Sale, as determined by the Corporation's independent public accountants.  Shares
of Preferred  Stock  converted into Common Stock shall not be reissued but shall

shares of Common Stock  deliverable  upon the conversion of the Preferred  Stock

                  (g) In case of any  combination  or  change  of the  Preferred
Stock or Common Stock into a different number of shares of the same or any other
class or classes,  or in case of any  consolidation or merger of the Corporation
with or into  another  corporation,  or in case  of any  sale or  conveyance  to
another  corporation  of  the  property  of  the  Corporation  as an  entity  or
substantially as an entity, the aforesaid conversion rate shall be appropriately
adjusted  so that the rights of the  holders of the  Preferred  Stock and Common
Stock  will  not  be  diluted   as  a  result  of  such   combination,   change,
consolidation, merger, sale or conveyance.

                  SIXTH:  No holder of the Common  Stock or  Preferred  Stock of
this  Corporation  shall,  by reason of his  shareholdings,  have any preemptive
right to purchase,  subscribe to, or have first offered to him any shares of any
class of the Corporation,  presently or subsequently  authorized,  or any notes,
debentures,  bonds, or other securities of the Corporation  convertible into, or
carrying  options or  warrants  to purchase  shares of any class,  presently  or
subsequently authorized (whether or not the issuance of any such shares, or such
notes,  debentures,  bonds,  or other  securities,  would  adversely  affect the
dividend or voting rights

securities  convertible into, or carrying options or warrants to purchase shares
of any class without  offering any such shares of any class,  either in whole or
in part, to the existing shareholders of any class.

                  EIGHTH: The Corporation shall, to the fullest extent permitted
by Sections  722, 723 and 724 of the New York Business  Corporation  Law, as the
same may be amended and  supplemented,  indemnify  any and all  persons  whom it

first  day of the  month  following  the  month in which  the term of the  lease
commences.  Each succeeding  lease year during the term hereof shall commence on
the anniversary date of the first lease year.

                  Section 2.3  Immediately  following the  determination  of the
commencement date of the term of this lease, the LANDLORD and the TENANT, at the
request of either party,  shall execute an agreement in recordable form, setting
forth both the dates of the  commencement of the term of this lease and the date
of the termination hereof.

                  Section  2.4 The  parties  expect  that the term of this lease
will  commence  on the 1st day of April,  1996,  and end on the 31st day of May,
2006.  In the  event,  however,  that the  LANDLORD  is unable to  substantially
complete  the work set forth on Exhibit "C" by reason of strikes,  inability  to
obtain materials,  governmental regulations, acts of God or other matters beyond
LANDLORD's  control then and in that event the provisions of Section "2.1" shall
control the commencement of the term hereof.

the lease and all associated  documents are executed by the 15th day of January,
1996 and all  finishes  and  special  requirements  as per #11 of  Exhibit C are
finalized  by the 29th day of January,  1996,  the TENANT shall have the option,

the  Demised  Premises  substantially  completed  by the 15th day of May,  1996.
TENANT shall notify the LANDLORD in writing of TENANT'S intention to cancel this
lease no later than the 1st day of May, 1996. LANDLORD shall immediately respond
to the TENANT of LANDLORD's  ability to deliver the Demised Premises by the 15th
day of May, 1996 and provided LANDLORD shall substantially  complete the Demised
Premises by the 15th day of May,  1996,  TENANT's  notification  to the LANDLORD
shall be of no further  force and effect.  Should the lease have to be cancelled
all monies paid to the LANDLORD by the TENANT  shall be returned  within 30 days
of the cancellation and neither party shall have any further  obligation to each
other and the lease shall be null and void.

LANDLORD'S  workers.  In the event that TENANT'S workers shall interfere with or
impede  LANDLORD'S  workers,  then  upon  notice  from  LANDLORD,   TENANT  will
immediately  remove its workers from the Demised  Premises.  TENANT'S entry into
the Demised Premises for the purpose of making TENANT'S  installations shall not
be deemed a waiver of any of the TENANT'S rights under the lease,  nor shall the
same be deemed an acceptance of the work to be done by the LANDLORD hereunder.

                  Section 6.4 The TENANT shall, upon the expiration of earlier
termination of this lease, surrender to the LANDLORD the Demised

                                       10

<PAGE>
Premises,  together with all alterations and replacement  thereto, in good order
and  condition,  except  for  reasonable  wear  and  tear or  damage  by fire or
casualty.

                  If the  TENANT  shall  make  any  alterations  or  changes  or
additions to the Demised  Premises,  after the  commencement of the term of this
lease,  and LANDLORD  shall desire the same to be removed upon the expiration of
the term hereof,  then upon LANDLORD'S giving notice to the TENANT of its desire
to have  the  same  removed,  the  TENANT  will  remove  the  same  prior to the
expiration of the term hereof at TENANT'S sole cost and expense and TENANT will,
at its own cost and expense,  restore the premises to the  condition  which they
were in just prior to the commencement of the term hereof,  normal wear and tear

<PAGE>
remove debris on a daily basis,  as hereinabove  provided after one days' notice
by the LANDLORD, LANDLORD may order said contractors off the premises and refuse
them access to the Building thereafter.

                    COMPLIANCE WITH ORDERS, ORDINANCES, ETC.

                  Section 7.1 The TENANT  covenants  throughout the term of this
lease and any renewals hereof, at the TENANT'S sole cost and expense,  to comply
with all laws and  ordinances  and the orders and  requirements  of all federal,
state and municipal governments and appropriate departments, commissions, boards
and officers thereof,  which may be applicable to the TENANT'S particular use or

non-structural alterations.

                  Section  7.2 The  TENANT  shall  have the right to  contest by
appropriate  legal  proceedings,  in the name of the TENANT or the  LANDLORD  or
both,  but without  cost or expense to the  LANDLORD,  the  validity of any law,
ordinance,  order or  requirement  of the nature  referred  to in Section  "7.1"
hereof.  Provided  such  noncompliance  does not  subject  the  LANDLORD  to any
criminal  liability for failure so to comply therewith,  the TENANT may postpone
compliance therewith until the final determination of any proceedings,  provided
that all  such  proceedings  shall be  prosecuted  with  all due  diligence  and
dispatch, and if any lien or charge is incurred by reason of noncompliance,  the
TENANT may

                                       12


<PAGE>
nevertheless  make the contest  aforesaid  and delay  compliance  as  aforesaid,

reason of such noncompliance or delay therein.

                  Section 8.1 The TENANT  covenants  not to suffer or permit any
mechanic's  liens to be filed  against  the fee  interest  of the  LANDLORD  nor
against TENANT'S  leasehold  interest in the Demised Premises by reason of work,
labor,  services or materials  supplied or claimed to have been  supplied to the
TENANT or any contractor,  subcontractor  or any other party or person acting at
the request of the TENANT,  or anyone  holding the Demised  Premises or any part
thereof  through  or under  the  TENANT.  TENANT  agrees  that in the  event any
mechanic's  lien shall be filed  against  the fee  interest  of the  LANDLORD or
against the TENANT'S  leasehold  interest the TENANT  shall,  within thirty (30)
days  after  receiving  notice  of the  filing  thereof,  cause  the  same to be

<PAGE>
                  If TENANT  shall fail to cause such lien to be  discharged  or
bonded with the period aforesaid,  then in addition to any other right or reedy,
LANDLORD  may, but shall not be obligated  to,  discharge the same by paying the
amount  claimed to be due, by procuring the discharge of such lien by deposit by
bonding  proceedings,  and in any such event,  LANDLORD  shall be  entitled,  if
LANDLORD so elects,  to compel the prosecution of any action for the foreclosure
of such lien by the lienor and to pay the amount of the judgment in favor of the
lienor with interest,  costs and allowances.  Any amount so paid by LANDLORD and
all  reasonable  costs and  expenses  incurred  by  LANDLORD or the fee owner in
connection  therewith,  including but not limited to premiums on any bonds filed
and attorneys' fees, shall constitute  Additional Rental payable by TENANT under
this  lease and shall be paid by TENANT to  LANDLORD  within  ten days of demand
therefor.

emergency) may, but shall not be obligated to, make such payment or perform such
other act to the extent  the  LANDLORD  may deem  reasonably  desirable,  and in
connection  therewith to pay reasonable expenses and employ counsel. All sums so
paid by the LANDLORD and all expenses in  connection  therewith  shall be deemed

thereof  the  LANDLORD  and this lease  shall  continue in full force and effect
except as hereinafter set forth.

                           B.  If the Demised Premises are partially damaged
or rendered  partially  unusable by fire or other casualty,  the damages thereto
shall be  repaired  by and at the  expense of  LANDLORD  to the extent that said
damages include those installations originally installed by LANDLORD pursuant to
the Floor Plan and Work Letter  attached  hereto  known as Exhibits  "A" and "C"
respectively.

                           C.  If the Demised Premises are totally damaged or
rendered wholly unusable by fire or other casualty, then the LANDLORD shall have
the right to elect not to restore the same as hereinafter provided.

                           D.  If the Demised Premises are rendered wholly
unusable  or (whether  or not the  Demised  Premises  are damaged in whole or in
part) if the building shall be so damaged that LANDLORD shall decide to demolish
it or not to rebuild it,  then,  in any of such  events,  LANDLORD  may elect to
terminate  this lease or rebuild by written notice to TENANT given within ninety
(90) days after such fire or casualty  specifying a date for the  expiration  of
the lease or rebuilding, which date shall not be

owing shall be paid up to the date of destruction  and any payments of rent made

casualty,  then the  TENANT  shall  have the  option  of  canceling  this  lease

notice of the TENANT'S intention to cancel this lease.  Should the LANDLORD feel
that the Demised  Premises will be  substantially  restored  within said fifteen
(15) day  period,  LANDLORD  shall  respond  in  writing  to the  TENANT and the
TENANT'S  notice to the LANDLORD  shall be null and void and of no further force
and effect.

                           E.  Nothing contained hereinabove shall relieve
TENANT from liability that may exist as a result of damage from

                                       17

<PAGE>
fire or other  casualty.  Notwithstanding  the foregoing,  each party shall look
first to any  insurance in its favor before  making any claim  against the other
party for recovery for loss or damage resulting from fire or other casualty, and
to the extent that such insurance is in force and  collectable and to the extent
permitted by law,  LANDLORD and TENANT each hereby releases and waives all right
of recovery  against the other or any one claiming through or under each of them
by way of subrogation  or otherwise.  LANDLORD and TENANT'S  insurance  policies
shall  contain  a clause  providing  that such a  release  or  waiver  shall not
invalidate  the  insurance  and also,  provided that such policy can be obtained
without additional premiums. In the event that there are additional premiums for
such  waiver of  subrogation,  the party in whose  favor such waiver is intended
shall  have the  option  to  either  pay the  additional  premium  or waive  the
condition  that the other's policy contain the same.  TENANT  acknowledges  that
LANDLORD will not carry insurance on TENANT'S  furniture  and/or  furnishings or
any fixtures or equipment,  improvements,  or appurtenances  removable by TENANT
and agrees that LANDLORD  will not be obligated to repair any damage  thereto or
replace the same.

                           F.  TENANT hereby waives the provisions of Section
227 of the Real  Property  Law and agrees that the  provisions  of this  article
shall govern and control in lieu thereof.

                  Section 11.2 The TENANT shall not knowingly do or permit to be
done any act or thing upon the Demised Premises,  which will invalidate or be in
conflict  with fire  insurance  policies  covering the building of which Demised
Premises form a

                                       18

<PAGE>
part, and fixtures and property therein.  The TENANT shall at its expense comply
with all rules,  orders,  regulations or  requirements  of the New York Board of
Fire Underwriters, or any other similar body, which may be applicable to the the
TENANT'S use and occupancy of the Demised Premises,  provided that the necessity
for such compliance  results from the use and occupancy of the Demised  Premises
by the TENANT,  and shall not do, or permit  anything to be done, in or upon the
Demised Premises or bring or keep anything therein,  or use the Demised Premises
in a manner which shall  increase the rate of fire  insurance on the building of
which the Demised Premises form a part, or on the property located therein, over
that in effect when the lease  commenced,  unless the TENANT shall reimburse the
LANDLORD, as additional rent hereunder,  for that part of all insurance premiums
thereafter  paid by the LANDLORD,  which shall have been charged because of such
failure or use by the TENANT,  and shall make such  reimbursement upon the first
day of the month  following  written  receipt  of  notice of such  outlay by the
LANDLORD and evidence of the payment thereof.  TENANT'S proposed usage, as noted
in Article XXII, shall not increase the building's insurance rates.

                  Section   11.3   Notwithstanding   anything  to  the  contrary
contained in this lease, during any period after damage or destruction and until
the premises have been restored, the TENANT shall be entitled to an abatement of
rent and additional rent for the unusable portion of the Demised Premises,  on a
square foot basis.

                                  CONDEMNATION

                  Section  12.1 If the whole of the  Demised  Premises  shall be
taken for any public or  quasi-public  use by any lawful  power or  authority by
exercise of the right of condemnation or eminent domain, or by agreement between
LANDLORD and those  having the  authority  to exercise  such right  (hereinafter
called  "Taking"),  the term of this lease and all  rights of TENANT  hereunder,
except as hereinafter provided, shall cease and expire as of the date of vesting
of title as a result of the  Taking and the rent or  additional  rent paid for a
period after such date shall be refunded to TENANT upon demand.

                  Section 12.2 In the event of the Taking of less than the whole
of the demised  premises,  or the whole or part of the parking area,  this lease
shall cease and expire in respect of the portion of the Demised  Premises and/or
the parking area taken upon vesting of title as a result of the Taking,  and, if
the Taking results in the portion of the Demised  Premises  remaining  after the
Taking  being  inadequate,  in the  judgement  of  TENANT,  for  the  efficient,
economical  operation  of the  TENANT'S  business  conducted at such time in the
Demised  Premises,  TENANT may elect to terminate this lease by giving notice to
LANDLORD of such  election not more than  forty-five  (45) days after the actual
Taking by the condemning authority, stating the date of termination,  which date
of  termination  shall be not more than thirty (30) days after the date on which
such notice to LANDLORD

                                       20


<PAGE>
is given, and upon the date specified in such notice to LANDLORD, this lease and
the term hereof  shall cease and expire.  If TENANT does not elect to  terminate
this lease aforesaid:

                           (i)  The new rent payable under this lease shall

be the  product of the basic rent  payable  under  this  lease  multiplied  by a
fraction,  the  numerator  of  which  is the net  rentable  area of the  Demised
Premises  remaining  after the Taking,  and the  denominator of which is the net
rentable area of the Demised Premises immediately preceding the Taking, and

                           (ii)  The net award for the Taking shall be paid
to and first used by LANDLORD,  subject to the rights of  mortgagee,  to restore
the portion of the Demised Premises and the building  remaining after the Taking
to substantially  the same condition and tenantability  (hereinafter  called the
"Pre-Taking Condition") as existed immediately preceding the date of the Taking.

                  Section  12.3 In the  event of a Taking of less than the whole
of the Demised  Premises  which  occurs  during the period of two (2) years next
preceding the date of  expiration of the term of this lease,  LANDLORD or TENANT
may elect to  terminate  this lease by giving  notice to the other party to this
lease of such  election,  not more than  forty-five  (45) days  after the actual
Taking by the condemning authority, stating the date of termination,  which date
of  termination  shall be not more than thirty (30) days after the date on which
such notice of termination is given, and upon the date specified in such notice,
this  lease  and the  term  hereof  shall  cease  and  expire  and all  rent and
additional rent paid under this lease for a period after

                                       21
<PAGE>
such date of termination  shall be refunded to TENANT upon demand.  On or before
such date of termination,  TENANT shall vacate the Demised Premises,  and any of
TENANT'S property  remaining in the Demised Premises  subsequent to such date of
termination shall be deemed abandoned by TENANT and shall become the property of
LANDLORD.

                  Section 12.4 In the event of a Taking of the Demised Premises
or any part thereof, and whether or not this lease is terminated, TENANT shall
have no claim against LANDLORD or the condemning authority for the value of the
unexpired term of this lease, but:

                           (i)  TENANT  may   interpose  and  prosecute  in  any
proceedings in respect of the Taking,  independent  of any claim of LANDLORD,  a
claim for the reasonable value of TENANT'S fixtures and

                           (ii) A claim for TENANT'S moving expenses.

                           BANKRUPTCY OR OTHER DEFAULT

                  Section 13.1 A. Events of Bankruptcy.  The following  shall be
Events of Bankruptcy under this lease:

                  (i)  TENANT'S  becoming  insolvent,  as the term is defined in
Title 11 of the United States Code, entitled  Bankruptcy,  11 U.S.C. Sec. 101 et
seq. (the "Bankruptcy Code") or under the insolvency laws of New York State;

                  (ii) The appointment of a Receiver of Custodian for any or all
of TENANT'S property or assets;

                                       22
<PAGE>
                  (iii) The filing of a voluntary  petition under the provisions
of the Bankruptcy Code or Insolvency Laws:

                  (iv) The filing of an involuntary  petition  against TENANT as
the subject debtor under the Bankruptcy Code or Insolvency Laws, which is either
not  dismissed  within  sixty days of filing,  or results in the  issuance of an
order for relief against the debtor, whichever is later; or,

                  (v) TENANT'S  making or consenting  to an  assignment  for the
benefit of creditors of a common law composition of creditors.

                  B.  Landlord's Remedies.

                  (i)  Termination of Lease.  Upon the occurrence of an Event of
Bankruptcy,  LANDLORD  shall  have the right to  terminate  this lease by giving
thirty days prior written notice to TENANT, provided, however, that this Section
"13.1 (B) (i)" shall have no effect  while a case in which TENANT is the subject
debtor under the  Bankruptcy  Code is pending,  unless  TENANT or its Trustee in
bankruptcy is unable to comply with the  provisions  of Sections  "13.1 (B) (V)'
and '13.1 (B) (vi)'  below.  If TENANT or its  Trustee is unable to comply  with
Sections  "13.1  (B) and (v)" and  "13.1  (B)  (vi)"  below,  this  lease  shall
automatically cease and terminate,  and TENANT shall be immediately obligated to
quit the premises  upon the giving of notice  pursuant to this Section "13.1 (B)
(i)". Any other notice to quit, or notice of LANDLORD'S intention to re-enter is
hereby expressly waived. If LANDLORD elects to terminate this lease,  everything
contained in this lease on the part of LANDLORD to be done and performed shall

                                       23
<PAGE>
cease without prejudice,  subject,  however, to the right of LANDLORD to recover
from TENANT all rent and any other sums accrued up to the time of termination or
recovery of possession by LANDLORD,  whichever is later,  and nay other monetary
damages or loss of reserved rent sustained by LANDLORD.

                  (ii)  Suit for  Possession.  Upon  termination  of this  lease
pursuant to Section "13.1 (B) (i)",  LANDLORD may proceed to recover  possession
under any by virtue of the  provisions  of the laws of the State of New York, or
by  such  other  proceedings,  including  re-entry  and  possession,  as  may be
applicable.

                  (iii)  Reletting of Premises.  Upon  termination of this lease
pursuant to Section  "13.1 (B) (i)",  the  premises may be relet by LANDLORD for
such rent and upon such terms as are not unreasonable  under the  circumstances,
and if the  full  rental  reserved  under  this  lease  (and  any of the  costs,
expenses,  or damages indicated below shall not be realized by LANDLORD,  TENANT
shall be liable for all  reasonable  damages  sustained by LANDLORD,  including,
without limitation,  deficiency in rent,  reasonable  attorneys' fees, brokerage
fees,  and  expenses  of  placing  the  premises  in the  first  class  rentable
condition. LANDLORD, in putting the premises in good order or preparing the same
for re- rental may, at LANDLORD'S  option,  make such alterations,  repairs,  or
replacements  in  the  premises  as  LANDLORD,  in  LANDLORD'S  reasonable  sole
judgment,  considers  advisable  and  necessary for the purpose of reletting the
premises, and the making of such alterations, repairs, or replacements shall not
operate or be construed to release TENANT from liability hereunder as aforesaid.
LANDLORD shall in no event be liable in any way

                                       24
<PAGE>
whatsoever  for failure to relet the  premises,  and in no event shall TENANT be
entitled to receive any excess, if any, of such net rent collected over the sums
payable by TENANT to LANDLORD hereunder.

                  (iv) Monetary Damages. Any damage or loss of rent sustained by
LANDLORD as a result of an Event of Bankruptcy may be recovered by LANDLORD,  at
LANDLORD'S  option, at the time of the reletting,  or in separate actions,  from
time to time, as said damage shall have been made more easily  ascertainable  by
successive relettings,  or, in a single proceeding deferred until the expiration
of the term of this lease (in which event TENANT hereby agrees that the cause of
action shall not be deemed to have accrued  until the date of expiration of said
term) or in a single  proceeding  prior to either the time of  reletting  or the
expiration  of the term of this  lease,  in which  event  TENANT  agrees  to pay
LANDLORD the  difference  between the present value of the rent  reserved  under
this lease on the date of breach, discounted at eight percent per annum, and the
fair market rental value of the Demised  Premises on the date of breach.  In the
event TENANT becomes the subject debtor in a case under the Bankruptcy  Code the
provisions of this Section "13.1 (B) (iv)" may be limited by the  limitations of
damage provisions of the Bankruptcy Code.

                  (v)  Assumption or Assignment by Trustee.  In the event TENANT
becomes  the  subject  debtor  in a case  pending  under  the  Bankruptcy  Code,
LANDLORD'S  right to terminate  this lease pursuant to this Section "13.1" shall
be subject to the rights of the Trustee in  Bankruptcy  to assume or assign this
lease. The

                                       25
<PAGE>
Trustee  shall not have the right to assume or  assign  this  lease  unless  the
Trustee:  (a)  Promptly  cures all  defaults  under  this  lease,  (b)  promptly
compensates  LANDLORD for monetary damages incurred as a result of such default,
and (c) provides adequate assurance of future performance.

                  (vi) Adequate  Assurance of Future  Performance.  LANDLORD and
TENANT hereby agree in advance that adequate assurance of future performance, as
used in  Section  "13.1 (B) (v)"  above,  shall  mean that all of the  following
minimum criteria must be met:

                  (a) The  Trustee  must pay to  LANDLORD,  at the time the next
payment of rent is then due under this lease,  in  addition  to such  payment of
rent, an amount equal to the next three month's rent due under this lease,  said
amount to be held by  LANDLORD  in escrow  until  either  the  Trustee or TENANT
defaults in its payment of rent or other obligations under this lease (whereupon
LANDLORD shall have the right to draw such escrow funds) or until the expiration
of this lease (whereupon the funds shall be returned to the Trustee or Tenant);

                  (b) The TENANT or Trustee  must agree to pay to the  LANDLORD,
at any time the LANDLORD is  authorized  to and does draw on the funds  escrowed
pursuant to Section "13.1 (B) (vi) (a)" above,  the amount  necessary to restore
such escrow account to the original level required by said provision;

                  (c) Tenant must pay its estimated  pro-rata  share of the cost
of all  services  provided by LANDLORD  (whether  directly or through  agents or
contractors,  if the cost of such service is the responsibility of the TENANT or
is to be passed through to TENANT) in advance of the performance or provision of
such services;

                                       26
<PAGE>
                  (d) The Trustee  must agree that  TENANT'S  business  shall be
conducted in a first class manner, and that no liquidating sales,  auctions,  or
other non-first class business operations shall be conducted on the premises;

                  (e) The  Trustee  must agree that the use of the  premises  as
stated in this lease will remain unchanged;

                  (f) The Trustee must agree that the  assumption  or assignment
of this  lease will not  violate  or affect  the rights of other  tenants of the
LANDLORD.

                  (vii)  Failure to  Provide  Adequate  Assurance.  In the event
TENANT is unable to:

                  (a)  cure its defaults; or

                  (b)  reimburse LANDLORD for its monetary damages; or

                  (c) pay the rent due under this lease, on time (or within five
days of the due date); or,

                  (d) meet the criteria and obligations imposed by Section "13.1
(B) (vi)" above; then TENANT agrees in advance that it has not met its burden to
provide  adequate  assurance  of  future  performance,  and  this  lease  may be
terminated by LANDLORD in accordance with Section "13.1 (B) (i)" above.

                  Section 13.2  Default of TENANT

                  A.  Events of default.  The following shall be events

<PAGE>
                  (ii) TENANT'S failure to make any other payment required under
this lease i such failure shall continue beyond ten days after LANDLORD'S notice
that the same has not been paid.

                  (iii)  TENANT'S  violation  or failure  to perform  any of the
other terms,  conditions,  covenants or agreements herein made by TENANT if such
violation  or failure  continues  for a period of five days if it affects  other
tenants of the building or ten days in all other cases, after LANDLORD'S written
notice  thereof to TENANT,  provided  that no such  notice  shall be required if
TENANT has  received a similar  notice  within one  hundred  eighty days of such
violation or failure.

                  (iv) In the event of any  violation  or  failure  to perform a
covenant as contemplated in Section '13.2(A) (iii)', and if such covenant cannot
be performed within the said five day or ten day period,  whichever the case may
be, then and in that even , providing TENANT has promptly commenced to cure such
violation  and is  diligently  proceeding  with the cure the time  within  which
TENANT may cure the same shall be  extended  to such  reasonable  time as may be
necessary to cure the same with all due diligence.

                  B. If an Event of Default as hereinabove  specified in Section
'13.2(A) (i), (ii) or (iii)' shall occur, and shall not be cured within the time
period  specified  in  LANDLORD's  notice,  or as to a default  provided  for in
Section  '13.2(A)  (iii)' if same shall recur within 180 days of LANDLORD'S last
notice of same or if TENANT has commenced a cure but fails to diligently proceed
with same after five (5) days notice from LANDLORD then:

                                       28
<PAGE>
                  (i)  LANDLORD  may  give  TENANT  a  five  day  notice  of its
intention to end the term of this lease,  and  thereupon,  at the  expiration of
said five day period,  this lease shall expire as fully and completely as if the
day were the date herein  originally  fixed for the  expiration of the term, and
TENANT shall then quit and  surrender  the premises to LANDLORD but TENANT shall
continue to remain liable as hereinafter  provided;  or, (ii) LANDLORD,  without
prejudice  to any other  right or  remedy  of  LANDLORD,  held  hereunder  or by
operation of law, and notwithstanding any waiver of any breach of a condition or
Event of Default  hereunder,  may,  at its option and  without  further  notice,
re-enter the Demised Premises or dispossess TENANT and any legal  representative
or successor of TENANT or other occupant of the premises by summary  proceedings
or other appropriate suit, action or proceeding or otherwise and remove his, her
or its effects and hold the Demised Premises as if this lease had not been made;
and TENANT  hereby  expressly  waives  the  service  of notice of  intention  to
re-enter or to institute legal proceedings to that end.

                  Section   13.3   Notwithstanding   such   default,   re-entry,
expiration and/or dispossession by summary proceedings or otherwise, as provided
in Section  '13.2' above,  TENANT shall  continue  liable during the full period
which would otherwise have constituted the balance of the term hereof, and shall
pay as  liquidated  damages  at the same  times  as the  Basic  Annual  Rent and
Additional  Rent and other charges become payable under the terms hereof,  a sum
equivalent to the Basic Annual Rent and Additional

                                       29
<PAGE>
Rent and other charges  reserved herein (less only the net proceeds of reletting
as hereinafter  provided),  and LANDLORD may rent the Demised Premises either in
the name of  LANDLORD  may  rent  the  Demised  Premises  either  in the name of
LANDLORD or otherwise,  reserving  the right to rent the Demised  Premises for a
term of terms which may be less than or exceed the period which would  otherwise
have been the balance of the term of this lease  without  releasing the original
TENANT from any liability,  applying any monies collected,  first to the expense
of  resuming  or  obtaining  possession,  next to  restoring  the  premises to a
rentable  condition,  and then to the payment of any brokerage  commissions  and
legal fees in connection with the reletting of the Demised  Premises and then to
the payment of the Basic Annual Rent,  Additional Rent and other charges due and
to grow due to  LANDLORD  hereunder,  together  with  reasonable  legal  fees of
LANDLORD therefore.

                  Section  13.4  LANDLORD  and TENANT do hereby  mutually  waive
trial by jury in any  action,  proceeding  or  counterclaim  brought  by  either
LANDLORD  or TENANT  against  the other with  regard to any  matters  whatsoever
arising out of or in any way  connected  with this lease,  the  relationship  of
LANDLORD and TENANT,  and  TENANT'S  use or  occupancy of the Demised  Premises,
provided such waiver is not prohibited by any laws of the State of New York. Any
action or proceeding brought by either party hereto against the other,  directly
or indirectly,  arising out of this agreement (except for a summary proceeding),
shall be  brought  in a court in the County in which the  Demised  Premises  are
located and all motions in any such action shall be made in such County.

<PAGE>
                  Section  13.5  TENANT  hereby  agrees  that in any  action  or
summary  proceeding brought by LANDLORD for the recovery of Basic Annual Rent or
Additional  Rent, it will not interpose any  non-compulsatory  counter-claim  or
set-off nor will TENANT seek to consolidate or join for trial any such action or
proceeding with any other action or proceeding.

                  Section  13.6 If TENANT  shall  default in the  observance  or
performance of any term or covenant on TENANT'S part to be observed or performed
under or by virtue of any of the terms or  provisions  in this  article  of this
lease,  LANDLORD may  immediately  or at any time  thereafter and without notice
perform  the  same  for  the  account  of  TENANT  and  if  LANDLORD  makes  any
expenditures  or incurs any  obligations  for the payment of money in connection
therewith  including,  but not  limited  to,  attorneys'  fees  in  instituting,
prosecuting or defending any action or proceeding  such sums paid or obligations
incurred with interest and costs shall be deemed to be additional rent hereunder
and the sum shall be due  immediately  upon LANDLORD  incurring  same and may be
included as an item of additional rent in any summary  proceeding  instituted by
the LANDLORD.

                  Section  13.7 In the  event of any  default  by the  TENANT or
LANDLORD  hereunder  and either shall  commence  any action or other  proceeding
against  the other in which the other  shall be  successful,  or which  shall be
settled  by  the  payment  of a sum of  money  to the  successful  party  by the
unsuccessful  party, the  unsuccessful  party agrees to reimburse the successful
party  for  reasonable  attorneys'  fees  in  connection  with  such  action  or
proceeding.

                        CUMULATIVE REMEDIES -- NO WAIVER

                  Section  14.1 The  specific  remedies to which the LANDLORD or
the TENANT may resort under the terms of this lease are  cumulative  and are not
intended to be exclusive of any other remedies or means or redress of which they
may be lawfully  entitled in case of any beach or threatened breach by either of
them of any  provision  of this lease.  The failure of the LANDLORD to insist in
any one or more cases upon the strict  performance  of any of the  covenants  of
this lease, or to exercise any option herein  contained,  shall not be construed
as a waiver or  relinquishment  for the future of such  covenant  or  option.  A
receipt by the  LANDLORD of rent with  knowledge  of the breach of any  covenant
thereof  shall not be deemed a waiver of such  breach,  and no  waiver,  change,

Additional Rents therein,  one-half of such  consideration  shall be paid to the
LANDLORD as  additional  rent. In the event TENANT shall sublet any of the space
demised  hereunder and the rent and/or  additional  rent reserved under any such
sublease shall be in excess of the rent provided for hereunder, TENANT shall pay
to the LANDLORD, as additional rent, as and when same is collected, one-half the
difference between the rent and additional rent reserved herein and the rent and
additional rent reserved in such sublease.

                  Section 22.5 In the event that any sub-tenant should hold over
