Item 7.  MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND
         RESULTS OF OPERATIONS
         Liquidity.  The Partnership's assets are deposited in separate
commodity trading accounts with DWR, the commodity broker, and are used by
the Partnership as margin to engage in trading commodity futures contracts
and forward contracts on foreign currencies. DWR holds such assets in
either designated depositories or in securities approved by the Commodity
Futures Trading Commission ("CFTC") for investment of customer funds.  The
Partnership's assets held by DWR may be used as margin solely for the
Partnership's trading.  Since the Partnership's sole purpose is to trade
in commodity futures contracts and other commodity interests, it is
expected that the Partnership will continue to own such liquid assets for
margin purposes.
         The Partnership's investment in commodity futures contracts and
other commodity interests may be illiquid.  If the price for a futures
contract for a particular commodity has increased or decreased by an
amount equal to the "daily limit", positions in the commodity can neither
be taken nor liquidated unless traders are willing to effect trades at or
within the limit.  Commodity futures prices have occasionally moved the
daily limit for several consecutive days with little or no trading.  Such
market conditions could prevent the Partnership from promptly liquidating
its commodity futures positions.
         There is no limitation on daily price moves in trading forward
contracts on foreign currencies.  The markets for some world currencies
have low trading volume and are illiquid which may prevent the Partnership
from trading in potentially profitable markets or prevent the Partnership
from promptly liquidating unfavorable positions in such markets and
subjecting it to substantial losses.
<PAGE>
         Either of these market conditions could result in restrictions on
redemptions.

         Market Risk.  The Partnership trades futures, options and forward
contracts in interest rates, stock indices, commodities and currencies. 
In entering into these contracts there exists a risk to the Partnership
(market risk) that such contracts may be significantly influenced by
market conditions, such as interest rate volatility, resulting in such
contracts being less valuable.  If the markets should move against all of
the commodity interest positions held by the Partnership at the same time,
and if the Trading Advisors were unable to offset commodity interest
positions of the Partnership, the Partnership could lose all of its
assets.  The Partnership has established Trading Policies for liquidity
and leverage which help control market risk.  Both the Trading Advisors
and Demeter monitor the Partnership's trading activities on a daily basis
to ensure compliance with the Trading Policies.  Demeter may (under terms
of the Management Agreements) override the trading instructions of a
Trading Advisor to the extent necessary to comply with the Partnership's
Trading Policies.
         Credit Risk.  In addition to market risk, the Partnership is subject
to credit risk in that a counterparty may not be able to meet its
obligations to the Partnership.  The counterparty of the Partnership for
futures contracts traded in the United States and most foreign exchanges
on which the Partnership trades is the clearinghouse associated with such
exchange.  In general, clearinghouses are backed by the membership of the
exchange and will act in the event of non-performance by one of its
members or one of its members' customers, and as such, should
significantly reduce this credit risk.  In cases where the Partnership
trades on exchanges where the clearinghouse is not backed by the 
<PAGE>
membership or when the Partnership enters into off-exchange contracts with
a counterparty, the sole recourse of the Partnership will be the
clearinghouse or the counterparty as the case may be.  With respect to
futures contracts, DWR, in its business as an international commodity
broker, constantly monitors the credit-worthiness of the exchanges and
clearing members of the foreign exchanges with which it does business for
clients, including the Partnership.  If DWR believes that there was a
problem with the credit-worthiness of an exchange on which the Partnership
deals, it would so advise Demeter.  With respect to forward contract
trading, the Partnership trades with only those counterparties which
Demeter, together with DWR, have determined to be creditworthy.  As set
forth in the Partnership's Trading Policies, in determining credit-
worthiness, Demeter and DWR consult with the Corporate Credit Department
of DWR.  Currently, the Partnership deals solely with DWR as its
counterparty on forward contracts.  While DWR and Demeter monitor credit-
worthiness and risk involved in dealing on the various exchanges and with
counterparties, there can be no assurance that an exchange or counterparty
will be able to meet its obligations to the Partnership. 
         Capital Resources.  The Partnership does not have, nor does it
expect to have, any capital assets.  Redemptions of additional Units in
the future will impact the amount of funds available for investments in
commodity futures, forward contracts on foreign currencies and other
commodity interests in subsequent periods.  As redemptions are at the
discretion of Limited Partners, it is not possible to estimate the amount
and therefore, the impact of future redemptions.

Cornerstone Fund IV, the currency Fund, recorded net losses during January as a
decline in the value of the U.S. dollar relative to most major world currencies
resulted in losses. As January progressed, the advisors to the Fund reversed
positions only to experience additional losses when the U.S. dollar
strengthened sharply on January 31. Significant gains were recorded during
February and March due to a trend higher in the value of the Japanese yen and
most major European currencies relative to the U.S. dollar. As a result,
trading gains were recorded from long positions in the Japanese yen, German
mark, as well as the Swiss and French francs and Norwegian krone.
 
In April, Fund IV continued to record gains from the upward trend in the value
of the Japanese yen relative to the U.S. dollar, as well as from transactions
involving the Australian and New Zealand dollars. A reversal in the downward
trend in the value of the U.S. dollar versus most major European currencies and
the Japanese yen during May resulted in losses from transactions involving the
German mark, French franc, Norwegian krone and

Japanese yen. In June, small losses were recorded from transactions involving
the Japanese yen, British pound and French franc as the value of most major
world currencies moved in a trendless range versus the U.S. dollar and one
another. These losses were partially offset by gains from trading in the German
mark and Australian dollar.
 
During July, Fund IV sustained losses as most foreign currencies, particularly
the Australian and New Zealand dollars, as well as the German mark, continued
to move in a trendless pattern relative to the U.S. dollar and one another.
Trading gains were recorded during August as the Fund's previously established
short positions in the Japanese yen profited from a sharp downward move in the
value of the Japanese yen relative to the U.S. dollar. During September, the
Fund recorded small net losses primarily as a result of a reversal in an upward
move in the value of the U.S. dollar relative to most major European
currencies, as well as the Japanese yen, on September 20 and 21. This sudden
reversal resulted in losses from transactions involving the German mark, French
franc and British pound. However, gains recorded from trading in the Japanese
yen earlier in the month, offset a majority of Fund losses for the month.
 
Fund IV began the fourth quarter by recording net gains as the Fund's short yen
positions profited from the continued decline of the Japanese yen relative to
the U.S. dollar. Net losses were recorded during November due primarily to
trendless movement in the value of world currencies, particularly the
Australian dollar, German mark and French franc, relative to the U.S. dollar.
Trading in the Japanese yen also resulted in losses as the previous downward
trend in the value of the yen versus the U.S. dollar subsided during the month.
During December, Fund IV recorded small net losses as the value of the British
pound relative to the U.S. dollar moved sharply
<PAGE>
 
higher late in the month. As a result, losses were recorded from the Fund's
previously established short British pound positions. Trading gains from
transactions involving the Japanese yen and German mark offset a majority of the
losses experienced in the British pound.
 
Cornerstone Fund II, a diversified fund, recorded losses during January as a
result of the aforementioned currency activity, as well as from trading in
financial and agricultural futures. Fund II profited significantly during
February and March as the value of most major world currencies relative to the
U.S. dollar increased, resulting in profits for the Fund's long positions in
major European currencies, as well as the Japanese yen. Additional gains were
recorded from long positions in global bond futures positions as prices moved
higher during this period as well as in crude oil futures trading.
 
In April, a continued upward trend in global financial futures prices resulted
in gains for Fund II's previously established long stock index and bond futures
positions. Additional gains were recorded for the Fund's long Japanese yen
positions as the value of the yen continued to move higher versus the U.S.
dollar. Small net losses were recorded during May as trading losses in
traditional commodities, such as energy, agricultural and metals futures, as
well as in currencies, more than offset gains recorded from long positions in
global financial futures. During June, Fund II recorded small net losses as the
previous upward trend in international interest rate futures prices pulled back
during the month. These losses, coupled with smaller losses in the currency and
agricultural futures markets, offset gains recorded in the energy and coffee
futures markets.
 
During July, Fund II posted net losses as a result of trading in both U.S. and
international bond futures. Additional Fund losses were recorded in the
currency markets as the value of most major world
<PAGE>
 
currencies moved in a narrow trading range relative to the U.S. dollar and one
another. During August, losses were recorded in global bond futures,
particularly in U.S. Treasury bond futures, as bond futures prices experienced
a period of short-term volatile movement. These losses, coupled with losses
recorded in soft commodities and silver futures, more than offset gains
recorded from transactions involving the Japanese yen. Fund II also recorded
losses in September due primarily to erratic price movement in global interest
rate and stock index futures. Losses were also recorded in energy futures
trading, as oil and gas prices reversed dramatically, and in metals futures
trading, as both precious and base metals prices remained relatively trendless.
 
Small net losses were recorded during October as trendless price movement was
commonplace in several of the markets traded by the Fund, including cotton,
crude oil and overseas interest rate futures. However, trading profits were
recorded from short Japanese yen positions, as well as from trading in the
agricultural and metals markets. During November, profits were recorded as
global bond futures prices increased during the month, resulting in gains in
U.S., European and Japanese interest rate futures. Additional gains were
recorded from short coffee futures positions as prices declined during the
month. In December, Fund II was profitable primarily due to trading in the
energy markets, as long positions in crude and heating oil profited from
increasing oil prices, and in soft commodities, as gains were recorded as a
result of trading in both sugar and coffee futures. Increasing soybean and corn
prices during the month resulted in additional gains for the Fund's long
soybean and corn futures positions.
 
Cornerstone Fund III, also a diversified fund, experienced losses during
January due to trading in the currency, financial and agricultural markets.
During February and March, significant gains were recorded as a
<PAGE>
 
result of trading in the currency markets as the value of the U.S. dollar moved
lower versus most world currencies. Strong gains were also recorded from long
positions in global bond futures, as prices in these markets increased during
this two month period.
 
Trading in global financial futures was profitable during April and May as both
U.S. and international interest rate futures prices continued to trend higher.
Additional gains were recorded in stock index futures, specifically from
trading Nikkei and S&P 500 Index futures. Small net gains were recorded during
June as trading in base metals, energy and soft commodities futures more than
offset trading losses recorded in international interest rate futures,
currencies and livestock futures.
 
During July, trading losses were recorded in financial futures as global
interest rate futures prices retreated from their previous upward trend.
Additional losses were recorded in Japanese stock index futures as a sharp
reversal in Japanese stock prices resulted in losses for the Fund's previously
established short Nikkei Index futures positions. In August, gains were
recorded from short positions in the Japanese yen, as the value of the yen
moved lower relative to the U.S. dollar, and from long positions in Nikkei
Index and corn futures as prices in both of these markets moved higher. In
September, net gains were recorded as long positions in Japanese, European and
Australian interest rate futures profited from increasing global bond prices.
Smaller gains in agricultural futures and soft commodities contributed to the
Fund's gains for the month.
 
 
Net losses were recorded during October due to losses in soft commodities
trading as cotton and coffee prices moved in a trendless pattern, as well as
from trading in currencies and global financial futures. During November,
profits were recorded primarily from long positions in global interest rate
<PAGE>
 
and S&P 500 Index futures, as prices moved higher. Smaller gains were recorded
in soft commodities and energy futures trading. Fund III ended 1995 with strong
gains during December as a result of trading in energy futures as long gas and
oil positions profited from a dramatic price move higher. Agricultural futures
trading resulted in additional gains as long positions in corn, soybean meal
and soybean futures also benefited from rising prices.
 
Overall, each of the Cornerstone Funds was able to record significant profits
during the calendar year of 1995. Cornerstone Funds II and III recorded profits
primarily due to price trends in the global financial futures and currency
markets. Cornerstone Fund IV profited as it was able to capitalize on currency
trends in the first half of the year. Since their inception in 1985,
Cornerstone Fund II has increased by 190.3% (a compound annualized return of
10.2%) and Cornerstone Fund III has increased by 157.3% (a compound annualized
return of 9.0%). Cornerstone Fund IV, since its inception in 1987, has
increased by 185.8% (a compound annualized return of 12.9%).

NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
 
1. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES
 
ORGANIZATION--Dean Witter Cornerstone Fund II, Dean Witter Cornerstone Fund III
and Dean Witter Cornerstone Fund IV (individually, a "Partnership", or
collectively, the "Partnerships") are limited partnerships organized to engage
in the speculative trading of commodity futures contracts and forward contracts
on foreign currencies. The general partner for each Partnership is Demeter
Management Corporation (the "General Partner"). The commodity broker is Dean
Witter Reynolds Inc. ("DWR"). Both DWR and the General Partner are wholly-owned
subsidiaries of Dean Witter, Discover & Co.
 
The General Partner is required to maintain a 1% minimum interest in the equity
of each Partnership and income (losses) are shared by the General and Limited
Partners based upon their proportional ownership interests.
 
BASIS OF ACCOUNTING--The preparation of financial statements in conformity with
generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates
and assumptions that affect the reported amounts in the financial statements.
 
REVENUE RECOGNITION--Commodity futures contracts and forward contracts on
foreign currencies are open commitments until settlement date. They are valued
at market and the resulting unrealized gains and losses are reflected in
income. Monthly, DWR pays each Partnership interest income based upon 80% of
its average daily Net Assets at a rate equal to the average yield on 13-Week
U.S. Treasury Bills issued during such month. For purposes of such interest
payments in Dean Witter Cornerstone Fund IV, Net Assets do not include monies
due the Partnership on forward contracts and other commodity interests, but not
actually received.
 
NET INCOME (LOSS) PER UNIT--Net income (loss) per Unit is computed using the
weighted average number of units outstanding during the period.
 
EQUITY IN COMMODITY FUTURES TRADING ACCOUNTS-- The Partnerships' assets "Equity
in Commodity futures trading accounts" consists of cash on deposit at DWR to be
used as margin for trading and the net asset or liability related to unrealized
gains or losses on open contracts. The asset or liability related to the
unrealized gains or losses on forward contracts is presented as a net amount
because each Partnership has a master netting agreement with DWR.

DEAN WITTER CORNERSTONE FUNDS
NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS--(CONTINUED)
 
BROKERAGE COMMISSIONS AND RELATED TRANSACTION FEES AND COSTS--Brokerage
commissions for each Partnership are accrued at 80% of DWR's published non-
member rates on a half-turn basis.
 
Through March 31, 1995, brokerage commissions were capped at 1% per month of
the adjusted Net Assets allocated to each trading program employed by a Trading
Advisor. Effective April 1, 1995, the cap was reduced to 3/4 of 1%.
 
Related transaction fees and costs are accrued on a half-turn basis.
 
OPERATING EXPENSES--Each Partnership has entered into an exchange agreement
pursuant to which certain common administrative expenses (i.e., legal,
auditing, accounting, filing fees and other related expenses) are shared by
each of the Partnerships based upon the number of Units of each Partnership
outstanding during the month in which such expenses are incurred. In addition,
the Partnerships incur monthly management fees and may incur incentive fees.
The General Partner bears all other operating expenses.
 
INCOME TAXES--No provision for income taxes has been made in the accompanying
financial statements,
as partners are individually responsible for reporting income or loss based
upon their respective share of each Partnership's revenues and expenses for
income tax purposes.
 
DISTRIBUTIONS--Distributions, other than on redemptions of Units, are made on a
pro-rata basis at the sole discretion of the General Partner. No distributions
have been made to date.
 
CONTINUING OFFERING--Through September 26, 1994, Units of each Partnership were
offered at a price equal to 107.625% of the Net Asset Value per Unit as of the
opening of business on the first day of the month, which price included a 5%
selling commission and a 2.5% charge for expenses relating to the continuing
offering of Units. These expenses were shared by the Partnerships. Any funds
received by DWR as a result of the Continuing Offering Expense charges that
were in excess of the Continuing Offering Expenses incurred, were contributed
pro-rata to the Partnerships, as a contribution of capital to the Partnerships
for which no Units were issued. On September 26, 1994, the Continuing Offering
was discontinued.
 
REDEMPTIONS--After an initial 180-day period, Limited Partners may redeem some
or all of their Units at 100% of the Net Asset Value per Unit as of the last
day of any month upon fifteen days advance notice by redemption form to the
General Partner.
<PAGE>
 
DEAN WITTER CORNERSTONE FUNDS
NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS--(CONTINUED)
 
If the proceeds of a redemption are reinvested in any of the Partnerships
within 180 days, the General Partner will waive the selling commissions and
continuous offering expense charges on the amount reinvested.
 
EXCHANGES--On the last day of the first month, which occurs more than 180 days
after a person first becomes a Limited Partner in any of the Partnerships, and
the end of each month thereafter, Limited Partners may transfer their
investment among the Partnerships (subject to certain restrictions outlined in
the Limited Partnership Agreement) without paying additional charges.
 
DISSOLUTION OF THE PARTNERSHIP--Each Partnership will terminate on September
30, 2025 regardless of its financial condition at such time, upon a decline in
Net Assets to less than $250,000, a decline in the Net Asset Value per Unit to
less than $250, or under certain other circumstances defined in the Limited
Partnership Agreement.
 
2. RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS
 
Each Partnership pays brokerage commissions to DWR on trades executed on its
behalf as described in Note 1. Each Partnership's cash is on deposit with DWR
in commodity trading accounts to meet margin requirements as needed. DWR pays
interest on these funds as described in Note 1.
 
3. TRADING ADVISORS
 
The General Partner, on behalf of each Partnership, retains certain commodity
trading advisors to make all trading decisions for the Partnerships. The
trading advisors for each Partnership as of December 31, 1995 were as follows:

 John W. Henry & Co., Inc.
 
Dean Witter Cornerstone Fund III

MANAGEMENT FEE--The management fee is accrued at the rate of 1/3 of 1% per
month of the Net Assets
under management by each trading advisor at each month end.
 
INCENTIVE FEE--Each Partnership will pay an annual incentive fee equal to 15%
of the "New Appreciation" in Net Assets as of the end of each annual incentive
period ending December 31, except for Dean Witter Cornerstone Fund IV, which
will pay incentive fees at the end of each annual incentive period ending May
31. Such incentive fee is accrued in each month in which "New Appreciation"
occurs. In those months in which "New Appreciation" is negative, previous
accruals, if any, during the incentive period will be reduced. In those
instances in which a Limited Partner redeems an investment, the incentive fee
(if earned through a redemption date) is to be paid on those redemptions to the
trading advisor in the month of such redemption.
 
4. FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS
 
The Partnerships trade futures and forward contracts in interest rates, stock
indices, commodities, currencies, petroleum and precious metals. Risk arises
from changes in the value of these contracts and the potential inability of
counterparties to perform under the terms of the contracts. There are numerous
factors which may significantly influence the market value of these contracts,
including interest rate volatility. At December 31, 1995 and 1994, open
contracts were:

A portion of the amounts indicated as off-balance-sheet risk in forward foreign
currency contracts is due to offsetting forward commitments to purchase and to
sell the same currency on the same date in the future. These commitments are
economically offsetting, but are not offset in the forward market until the
settlement date.
 
The unrealized gains on open contracts are reported as a component of "Equity
in Commodity futures trading accounts" on the Statements of Financial Condition
and totaled at December 31, 1995 and 1994, respectively, $3,368,107 and
$4,316,080 for Cornerstone II, $5,578,294 and $5,016,857 for Cornerstone III
and $70,143 and $268,291 for Cornerstone IV.
 
For Cornerstone II, of the $3,368,107 net unrealized gain on open contracts at
December 31, 1995,
$3,448,812 related to exchange-traded futures contracts and ($80,705) related
to off-exchange-traded forward currency contracts. Of the $4,316,080 net
unrealized gain on open contracts at December 31, 1994, $4,296,011 related to
exchange-traded futures contracts and $20,069 related to off-exchange-traded
forward currency contracts.

For Cornerstone III, net unrealized gain on open contracts at December 31, 1995
related entirely to exchange traded futures. Of the $5,016,857 net unrealized
gain on open contracts at December 31, 1994, $5,788,691 related to exchange-
traded futures contracts and ($771,834) related to off-exchange-traded forward
currency contracts.
 
For Cornerstone IV, of the $70,143 net unrealized gain on open contracts at
December 31, 1995, $534,487 related to exchange-traded futures contracts and
$(464,344) related to off-exchange-traded forward currency contracts. The net
unrealized gain on open contracts at December 31, 1994, related entirely to
off-exchange-traded forward currency contracts.
 
The contract amounts in the above table represent the Partnership's extent of
involvement in the particular class of financial instrument, but not the credit
risk associated with counterparty nonperformance. The credit risk associated
with these instruments is limited to the amounts reflected in the Partnerships'
Statements of Financial Condition.
 
Exchange-traded contracts and off-exchange-traded forward currency contracts
held by the Partnerships at December 1995 and 1994 mature as follows:

The Partnerships also have credit risk because the sole counterparty, with
respect to most of the Partnerships' assets, is DWR. Exchange-traded futures
contracts are marked to market on a daily basis, with variations in value
settled on a daily basis. DWR, as the futures commission merchant of all of the
Partnership's exchange-traded futures contracts, is required pursuant to
regulations of the Commodity Futures Trading Commission to segregate from its
own assets, and for the sole benefit of its commodity customers, all funds held
by DWR with respect to exchange-traded futures contracts including an amount
equal to the net

unrealized gain on all open futures contracts which funds totaled at December
31, 1995 and 1994 respectively, $31,506,001 and $31,866,995 for Cornerstone II,
$47,872,659 and $48,673,471 for Cornerstone III, $105,462,448 and $111,508,180
for Cornerstone IV. With respect to the Partnership's off-exchange-traded
forward currency contracts, there are no daily settlements of variations in
value nor is there any requirement that an amount equal to the net unrealized
gain on open forward contracts be segregated. With respect to those off-
exchange-traded forward currency contracts, the Partnerships are at risk to the
ability of DWR, the counterparty on all of such contracts, to perform.
