<PAGE>   2


                                     PART I

     Item 1.  Business.  The registrant is a North Carolina limited partnership
formed in July 1986 (hereinafter referred to as the "Partnership").  The
Partnership engaged in a "blind pool offering," the proceeds of which were used
to purchase income-producing real property.  During the year ended December 31,
1988, the Partnership received the minimum investment required to remove
subscribers' funds from escrow.  The Partnership's offering terminated with a
total subscription of $3,195,000 from investor limited partners.  The net
proceeds were used to purchase the properties described in Item 2 below, to pay
the expenses of the offering and to fund the working capital account.  The
funds not required for those purposes, totalling $84,273, were returned to
investors.

     The sole business of the Partnership is the operation of commercial office
buildings purchased with the proceeds of the public offering.  (See Item 2
below for a description of the properties.)  During the year ended December 31,
1995, the occupancy of the United Carolina Bank Building was maintained at 100%
and the EastPark Executive Center facilities were maintained at 95% occupancy.
The lease terms with the major tenants at such properties are summarized below.

             (i)  EastPark Executive Center, Charlotte, NC - the General
        Services Administrator ("GSA") has a lease term for a ten (10) year
        period ending on October 31, 2004, at a rental rate of $14.15 per
        square foot.  GSA may, at its election, terminate the lease after eight
        (8) years.  The GSA leased premises include approximately 32,000 square
        feet.  The Partnership will, however, incur significant leasehold
        improvements expense of approximately $1,000,000 for the GSA space.
        Such improvements are currently scheduled to be completed sometime in
        June 1996.  Upon completion of the improvements, the GSA lease will
        account for approximately 78% of the rental income related to the
        EastPark Executive Center.

             (ii) United Carolina Bank Building, Greenville, SC - Metropolitan
        Life Insurance Company ("Metlife") is in the second year of a five year
        lease renewal.  The rental rate is $14.00 per square foot during the
        first three years of the renewal term and escalates to $14.25 per
        square foot during the last two years of the renewal term.  In lieu of
        granting an upfit allowance, Metlife was allowed a rent concession of
        $6,250 per month for the first twelve (12) months of the renewal term;
        the concession terminated July 31, 1995.  Metlife and United Carolina
        Bank ("UCB"), account for 68% and 21%, respectively, of the rental
        income related to the United Carolina Bank Building.  The UCB lease
        (which currently provides for a $14.06 per square foot rental rate)
        will expire on July 31, 1999.

     The General Partners believe that, after engaging in significant (but
unsuccessful) efforts to sell the Properties on acceptable terms in 1995, it is
in the best interests of the Partnership to focus in 1996 on (i) completing the
GSA upfit project at the EastPark Executive Center and (ii) securing a
refinancing of the UCB Building debt.  See Item 7 below for a discussion of
refinancing matters.

     The Partnership has no employees of its own; management of the
Partnership's property is performed by Kuester Properties, Inc., an affiliate
of FSK Limited Partnership.  Administration of the Partnership is performed by
the General Partners.  (See Items 10 and 13 below.)

     Item 2.  Properties.  On June 23, 1989, the Partnership purchased the
EastPark Executive Center, an office complex comprised of two buildings located
in Charlotte, North Carolina with net leasable area of 45,300 square feet, for
a purchase price of $3,155,138 of which $1,500,000 was provided by a first
mortgage loan bearing interest at 10.5% per annum and having a term of 10
years.  The lender, United of Omaha Life Insurance Company ("United Omaha"), is
not affiliated with the Partnership.

     On November 30, 1989, the Partnership acquired the United Carolina Bank
Building, a three-story office building in Greenville, South Carolina with net
leasable area of 39,138 square feet, for a purchase price of $4,202,544 of
which $3,110,000 was provided by a first mortgage loan from United Omaha,
bearing interest at 9.625% per annum and having a term of 7 years.

     In connection with the office building purchases, $26,312 of acquisition
costs were capitalized.

     No further purchases of real property are projected and no funds are
available for that purpose.

                                    PART II

     Item 7.  Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and
Results of Operations.

     Liquidity and Capital Resources

     During the year ended December 31, 1995, the Partnership continued to fund
working capital requirements.  The working capital deficiency increased from
($105,301) at December 31, 1994 to ($3,229,255) at December 31, 1995.  The
decrease in the working capital is primarily a result of the reclassification
of the loan on the United Carolina Bank building to current liabilities from
long-term debt.  The reclassification of the loan is due to the balloon payment
of approximately $2,817,000 that is due in December, 1996.  The lender, United
of Omaha Life Insurance Company, has indicated its willingness to agree to a
loan refinancing upon satisfaction of certain terms and conditions.  The
General Partners intend to finalize the definitive terms of such refinancing in
the near future.

     An increase in current liabilities can also be attributed to an additional
$750,000 line-of-credit note payable by the Partnership for the EastPark       
Executive Center GSA upfit, of which $219,783 was outstanding at December 31,  
1995.  This note is due on May 10, 1996.  The General Partners intend to       
increase the amount of such loan to $1,000,000 to cover substantially all of   
the GSA upfit costs and to obtain a loan term extension.                       

                                      3
                                                                               
                                                                               

<PAGE>   4
                                                                               
     The cumulative unpaid priority return to the unit holders increased from
$1,438,481 at December 31, 1994 to $1,681,265 at December 31, 1995.  This
increase resulted from no distributions being made to partners during the year
and the pro rata share due partners pursuant to the Limited Partnership
Agreement.  Based on current and projected commercial real estate market
conditions, the General Partners believe that it is reasonably unlikely that a
sale of the Partnership properties would produce net sale proceeds sufficient
to pay the priority return.  Furthermore, the General Partners believe that it
is reasonably unlikely that the Partnership's operating income or any
refinancing of Partnership debt would generate sufficient funds to pay the
priority return.

     During the year ended December 31, 1995, the Partnership had net income of
$29,787 compared to the net income (loss) of $17,865 and ($15,330) in 1994 and
1993, respectively.  Rental income, operating expenses, and interest expense
for the years ended December 31, 1995 and 1994 resulted exclusively from the
operations of the Partnership's commercial real estate properties.  The
EastPark Executive Center buildings, purchased June 23, 1989, were 88% leased
at December 31, 1994 and were 95% leased at December 31, 1995.  The United
Carolina Bank Building, purchased November 30, 1989, was 100% leased at
December 31, 1994 and 1995.  In March 1996, the Partnership renewed a lease
with a tenant in the United Carolina Bank Building for a term of five years.
The new lease resulted in a reduction in space leased and rental paid by the
tenant, and, accordingly, the occupancy rate for the United Carolina Bank
Building will be reduced to 96% on or about April 1, 1996.

     The rent concessions granted by the Partnership as a result of contract
renewal with a major tenant at the UCB Building decreased cash flow from rental
income by $43,750 during 1995.  Rental concessions are being amortized over the
life of the lease in order to recognize rental revenue evenly.  The Partnership
does not anticipate granting any additional rent concessions during 1996 at
either property.

     The Partnership entered into a Loan Extension and Modification Agreement
dated as of May 12, 1993 with Internet Services Corporation, a North Carolina
corporation (formerly International Network Services Corporation) owned equally
by three trusts, the beneficial interests of which inure respectively to the
benefit of the three children of Dexter Yager, the sole General Partner of DRY
Limited Partnership, which limited partnership is one of the two general
partners of the Partnership.  Pursuant to the Agreement, the Partnership agreed
to pay Internet $91,275 over a five-year period, with annual principal payments
of $18,255 each, together with interest at the rate equal to the prime rate of
NationsBank of North Carolina N.A., determined on an annual basis, plus two
percent (2.0%).

     See Item 13 (Certain Relationships and Related Transactions) for a
discussion regarding leasing commissions paid to Kuester Properties, Inc., a
General Partner of the Partnership.

     In the event that funds derived from operations are insufficient to meet
the Partnership's working capital needs, the General Partners have agreed to
fund the shortfall.

     Results of Operations

     Comparison of 1995 results with 1994.

     Operating results increased slightly from an operating income of $438,454
during the year ended December 31, 1994 to an operating income of $444,916 for
the comparable year 1995.  Operating income expressed as a percentage of rental
income decreased from 39.3% for the year ended December 31, 1994 to 37.9% for
the comparable year 1995.  While the overall occupancy rate for 1995 was
comparable to 1994, rental income nevertheless increased by approximately
$58,000.  This increase of rental income in 1995 can be attributed to having a
full year of the increased rental rates that were negotiated during the second
half of 1994.  Operating expenses were higher overall in 1995 by approximately
$51,000.  Increased professional fees, relating to the potential sale of the
properties, comprised the greatest increase in the expenses.  The remaining
expense increase can be attributed to increased repairs, maintenance,
depreciation and amortization.  Nonoperating income and expenses for the year
ended December 31, 1995 decreased 1.3% from the comparable year 1994.

     Comparison of 1994 results with 1993.

     Operating results increased from an operating income of $415,658 during
the year ended December 31, 1993 to an operating income of $438,454 for the
comparable year 1994.  Operating income expressed as a percentage of rental
income increased from 38.9% for the year ended December 31, 1993 to 39.3% for
the comparable year 1994.  While the overall

                                      4

<PAGE>   5

occupancy rate was down slightly in 1994, the increase in rental rates due to
the renewals of leases more than offset the occupancy change, resulting in an
overall increase in rental income of approximately $47,000.  Operating expenses
were higher overall in 1994 by approximately $24,000.  While certain expenses
decreased or remained relatively consistent in 1994, contract labor and
amortization expense relating to deferred leasing commissions increased.  These
expenses can be directly correlated to the increase in rental revenue. 
Property taxes also increased between the years due to an appealed amount from
prior years being paid in 1994.  Nonoperating income and expenses for the year
ended December 31, 1994 decreased 2.4% from the comparable year 1993.

                          INDEPENDENT AUDITOR'S REPORT


To the Partners
Yager/Kuester Public Fund
  Limited Partnership
Charlotte, North Carolina

We have audited the accompanying balance sheets of Yager/Kuester Public Fund
Limited Partnership as of December 31, 1995 and 1994, and the related
statements of operations, partners' equity and cash flows for each of the three
years in the period ended December 31, 1995.  These financial statements are
the responsibility of the Partnership's management.  Our responsibility is to
express an opinion on these financial statements based on our audits.

We conducted our audits in accordance with generally accepted auditing
standards.  Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to
obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of
material misstatement.  An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence
supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements.  An audit
also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant
estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial
statement presentation.  We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis
for our opinion.

In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present fairly, in
all material respects, the financial position of Yager/Kuester Public Fund
Limited Partnership as of December 31, 1995 and 1994, and the results of its
operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended
December 31, 1995, in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles.

As discussed in Notes 1 and 3 to the financial statements, the Partnership
changed its method of accounting for investment securities in 1994.

 LIMITED PARTNERSHIP

NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS


NOTE 1.   NATURE OF BUSINESS AND ORGANIZATION, PARTNERSHIP AGREEMENT AND
          SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES 

Nature of business and organization:  The Partnership is a North Carolina
limited partnership formed in July 1986.  The purpose of the Partnership is to
acquire, operate, hold for investment and sell property.  Properties currently
held are located in Charlotte, North Carolina and Greenville, South Carolina.

The general partners of the Partnership are DRY Limited Partnership, a North
Carolina limited partnership in which Dexter R. Yager, Sr. is the general
partner and FSK Limited Partnership, a North Carolina limited partnership in
which Faison S. Kuester, Jr. is the general partner.

Partnership agreement:  Under the terms of the partnership agreement, all
taxable income, tax losses and cash distributions from operations are to be
allocated 99% to the limited partners and 1% to the general partners until the
limited partners receive a return of their initial capital contributions and a
"Priority Return".  The Priority Return is a sum equal to 8% per annum
cumulative, but not compounded, (prorated for any partial year) of the adjusted
capital contributions of the limited partners, calculated from the last day of
the calendar quarter in which each limited partner is admitted to the
Partnership to the date of payment.  Thereafter, taxable income, tax losses and
cash distributions from operations will be allocated 75% to the limited
partners and 25% to the general partners.

Upon the sale or refinancing of any future partnership properties, the
partnership agreement specifies certain allocations of net proceeds and taxable
gain or loss from the transaction.

A summary of the Partnership's significant accounting policies follows:

Use of management's estimates:  The preparation of financial statements in
conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to
make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and
liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of
the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses
during the reporting period.  Actual results could differ from those estimates.

Cash and cash equivalents:  For purposes of reporting the statements of cash
flows, the Partnership includes all cash accounts, which are not subject to
withdrawal restrictions or penalties, and all highly liquid debt instruments
purchased with an original maturity of three months or less as cash and cash
equivalents on the accompanying balance sheets.  At various times throughout
the year, the Partnership may have cash balances at financial institutions
which exceed federally-insured amounts.

Investments:  Properties on operating leases and properties held for lease are
stated at the lower of cost less accumulated depreciation or fair market value.
Depreciation is computed by the straight-line method over 40 years for
buildings and over 15 years for building improvements.

Investment in marketable equity securities, securities available for sale and
accounting change:  Prior to January 1, 1994, the Partnership had investments
in marketable equity securities. Marketable equity securities consisted of
mutual funds and corporate equity securities.

NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------

NOTE 1.   NATURE OF BUSINESS AND ORGANIZATION, PARTNERSHIP AGREEMENT AND
          SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (CONTINUED)


The Partnership adopted the provisions of FASB Statement No. 115, Accounting
for Certain Investments in Debt and Equity Securities, as of January 1, 1994.
Statement No. 115 requires that management determine the appropriate
classification of securities at the date of adoption, and thereafter at the
date individual investment securities are acquired, and that the
appropriateness of such classification be reassessed at each balance sheet
date.  Since the Partnership neither buys securities in anticipation of
short-term fluctuations in market prices or can commit to holding debt
securities to their maturities, the investment in debt and marketable equity
securities have been classified as available for sale in accordance with
Statement No. 115.  Available for sale securities are stated at fair value, and
unrealized holding gains and losses are reported as a separate component of
partners' equity.

Prior to the adoption of Statement No. 115, the Partnership stated its
marketable equity securities at the lower of their aggregate cost or market,
with unrealized losses charged to a separate component of partners' equity.
Under both the newly adopted accounting standard and the Partnership's former
accounting practices, dividends on marketable equity securities are recognized
and included in income when declared.  Realized gains and losses, including
losses from declines in value of specific securities determined by management
to be other-than-temporary, are included in income.  Realized gains and losses
are determined on the basis of the specific securities sold.

Note 3 to the financial statements provides further information about the
effect of adopting Statement No. 115.

Deferred charges:  Deferred charges are related to prepaid fees which are
amortized over the length of the related loans, 7 to 10 years, on a
straight-line basis.

Deferred leasing commissions:  Deferred leasing commissions related to
obtaining specific leases are amortized using the straight-line method over the
noncancelable lease terms which range from three to eight years.

Revenue recognition:  Rental revenue is recognized evenly over the term of the
lease.  In connection with negotiating and obtaining leases, the Partnership's
management may at times grant concessions, such as free rent for a specific
number of months during the lease.  These costs are amortized over the life of
the lease.

Disclosures about the fair value of financial instruments: Financial Accounting
Standards Board Statement No. 107, Disclosures About Fair Value of Financial
Instruments, requires disclosure of fair value information about financial
instruments, whether or not recognized in the balance sheet, for which it is
practicable to estimate that value.  Statement 107 excludes certain financial
instruments and all nonfinancial instruments from its disclosure requirements.
At December 31, 1995 the carrying values of the Partnership's financial
instruments, including accounts receivable which are due on demand and the
mortgage payable which bears interest at market rates, approximate their fair
values.

Income taxes:  Under current income tax laws, income or loss of the Partnership
is included in the income tax returns of the partners.  Accordingly, the
Partnership will make no provision for federal or state income taxes.

NOTE 2.  WORKING CAPITAL RESERVE

Per the Partnership Agreement, a minimum cash and cash equivalents reserve of
$94,500 must be maintained to fund any expenditures that the cash flow
generated from properties on operating leases is insufficient to meet.  At
December 31, 1995 and 1994, the Partnership exceeded the minimum requirement by
$45,430 and $13,406, respectively.

NOTE 3.  ACCOUNTING CHANGE

As discussed in Note 1, the Partnership adopted FASB Statement No. 115 as of
January 1, 1994.  In accordance with Statement No. 115, the 1993 comparative
financial statements have not been restated for the change in accounting
principle.  There was no effect to net income in 1994 for adopting Statement
No. 115. The January 1, 1994 balance of partners' equity was increased by
$1,811 to recognize the net unrealized holding gain on securities at that date.

NOTE 4.  SECURITIES AVAILABLE FOR SALE

     Item 10.  Directors and Executive Officers of the Partnership.  The
Partnership has no executive officers and directors.  The General Partners of
the partnership are DRY Limited Partnership, the sole General Partner of which
is Dexter R. Yager, Sr., and FSK Limited Partnership, the sole General Partner
of which is Faison S. Kuester, Jr.

     Following is a brief discussion of the background and experience of
Messrs. Kuester and Yager.

     Faison S. Kuester, Jr., 50, graduated from the University of North
Carolina at Chapel Hill with a Bachelor of Arts Degree in History in 1967.  He
is a resident of Charlotte, North Carolina.  After two years service in the
United States Army as a Second Lieutenant, Mr. Kuester joined Independence
Development Corporation in 1972 serving as a director of leasing and management
for a period of three years.  In 1974, Mr. Kuester formed his own company,
Kuester Realty and Management, in order to lease and manage commercial
properties in Charlotte, North Carolina and surrounding communities.  In
addition to leasing and managing various commercial properties, Kuester Realty
had developed two medical clinics in the Charlotte area.  In 1980, Kuester
Properties, Inc. ("KPI") was formed to specialize in on-site management of
apartment communities in the southeastern United States.  The following year
Cauble and Kuester Company, Inc. was organized to lease and manage commercial
properties in the metropolitan Atlanta area.  This partnership brought together
Cauble and Company, experienced mortgage lenders and leasing agents in the
Atlanta market, and Kuester Realty and Management.  Finally, in 1983, Kuester
Development Corporation was formed to allow the Kuester companies to engage in
selective real estate development projects in the southeastern United States.

     Through Kuester Development Corporation, a wholly-owned subsidiary of KPI,
Mr. Kuester has been directly involved with the development of several
commercial real estate properties in North and South Carolina and Georgia.
These include the First United National Bank Building in Wilmington, North
Carolina, two retail office showroom projects, two medical office buildings and
residential condominiums in Charlotte, North Carolina, an office building in
Savannah, Georgia, and an office building in Greenville, South Carolina.
Kuester Development Corporation also has developed over 700 apartment units
throughout Charlotte, North Carolina since 1983.  KPI is active in the
management of these units as well as managing other clients' multifamily
developments throughout the Carolinas.

     In 1989, Mr. Kuester, Jr. established Kuester Hospitality Corporation for
the purpose of acquiring and managing health care facilities.  In 1995, he
established Kuester HealthCare Services, Inc. ("KHCS") to offer various health
care services, including development and brokerage of health care facilities.
Two assisted living facilities totalling 100 beds are currently under KHCS
management.  KHCS is currently involved in the development of a 70-bed facility
with plans to begin construction in July, 1996.  KHCS will be the manager after
completion.

     KPI serves as property manager of the Partnership property.

     Dexter R. Yager, Sr., 56, is the President and founder of D&B Yager

Partnership's general partners, officers and holders of more than 10% of the
Partnership's Partnership units to file with the Securities and Exchange
Commission initial reports of ownership and reports of changes in ownership of
Partnership units and any other equity securities of the Partnership.  To the
Partnership's knowledge, based solely upon review of the forms, reports and
certificates filed with the Partnership by such persons, all such Section 16(a)
filing requirements were complied with by such persons in 1995, except as
follows:

     Jerry R. Haynes - One Form 3 initial report of ownership was filed late.

     Item 11.  Executive Compensation.  The Partnership does not employ any
executive officers or directors and no compensation is paid to any person for
performing services typically provided by such an officer or director.  Dexter
R. Yager, Sr. and Faison S. Kuester have policymaking functions with regard to
Partnership operations.  See Item 10 for the relationship of such persons to
the Partnership.  See Item 13 for a description of payments made to Kuester
Properties, Inc. for property management services and to Internet Services
Corporation, Inc. for bookkeeping and accounting services.

     Item 12.  Security Ownership of Certain Beneficial Owners and Management.
The General Partners initially contributed a total of $2,500 to the capital of
the Partnership, consisting of a $1,600 contribution from DRY Limited
Partnership and $900 from FSK Limited Partnership.  The General Partners own a
1% interest in all items of Partnership income, gain, loss, deductions or
credits including 1% of net cash from operations.  The General Partners also
own a residual 25% interest in net cash from a sale or refinancing of the
Partnership Property, subordinated to the receipt by the Limited Partners of
the return of their capital contributions and their priority return and to the
payment of any subordinated real estate commissions due to affiliates of the
General Partners.

     The General Partners do not own any Limited Partnership interest in the
Partnership.

     Item 13.  Certain Relationships and Related Transactions.  During the
fiscal year ended December 31, 1995, Kuester Properties, Inc. received
management fees of $45,981 for management of the Partnership property.
Internet Services Corporation, Inc. received $5,000 for providing
accounting/bookkeeping services.  See Item 7 for a description of a loan to the
Partnership by Internet Services Corporation, a corporation owned equally by
three trusts, the beneficial interests of which inure to the benefit of three
children of Dexter R.  Yager, Sr., the sole General Partner of DRY Limited
Partnership, which limited partnership is one of the two general partners of
the Partnership.  Janitorial services for the EastPark Executive Center are
provided by Marquis Cleaning Services, which is operated and owned by Dexter R.

     The General Partners believe that the terms for the above mentioned
services are as favorable as those the Partnership might have obtained from
unaffiliated parties.

     Notwithstanding the above, either Owner or Agent shall have the express
right to terminate this Agreement for any reason at any time upon the giving of

disbursements by Agent for such maintenance and repairs exceed gross revenues,
Owner shall promptly reimburse Agent for such excess on demand.  Nothing herein

to enforce leases with tenants of the Premises and to collect rent and other
charges due from such tenants.  No provision hereof shall constitute a

obligation by any tenant of the Premises.  All monies collected by Agent on
behalf of Owner shall be deposited in Agent's trust account as described below.

or other sources with respect to the leasing, operation, and management of the
Premises in a trust account, separate from Agent's personal accounts.  The

Premises.  All monies deposited by Agent from time to time shall be deemed to
be trust funds and shall be and remain the property of Owner and shall be
disbursed by Agent for the account of Owner only as permitted by this
Agreement.  Agent may endorse any and all checks drawn to the order of Owner
for deposit in the trust account.  Owner shall at its expense cause a

trust account described in Paragraph 3.6 hereof.  Owner agrees that should
Agent make expenditures in excess of such balance performing its duties, Owner
shall promptly 

                                      3


<PAGE>   4

reimburse Agent.  Owner agrees to provide sufficient funds to
Agent such that all amounts due and owing in connection with the operation of
the Premises and the performance of Agent's duties hereunder may be promptly
paid by Agent.  Owner agrees to provide such funds as are necessary for the
maintenance of the reserve in Agent's trust account.

compensation pursuant to paragraph 5 hereof.  The approval of Owner shall be
required for expenditure of an amount in excess of $3,000 for any one item not
set forth in such approved budget except for emergency repairs if in the
opinion of Agent such repairs are necessary to protect the Premises from damage
or to maintain services to tenants.

     4.2 Contracts for Utilities and Other Services.  Agent shall have the
power and authority to make contracts on behalf of Owner and at Owner's expense
for electricity, vermin extermination, trash collection, security, water,
sewer, ad valorem tax service and any other utilities and operating services as

Agent shall reasonably deem necessary in the operation and maintenance of the
Premises; provided that such contracts are terminable with thirty (30) days
written notice by either party, or otherwise agreed to in writing by Owner.

     4.3 Lease Agreements.  Agent shall have the power and authority to enter
into lease agreements on behalf of Owner as principal, and to institute and
prosecute actions for the enforcement thereof, to terminate tenancies for
cause, and to sue for and in the name of Owner to recover rents and other sums
due.

     4.4 Employees.  Agent shall have the right and duly investigate, hire, pay
supervise and discharge all personnel necessary to be employed by it in order
to maintain and operate the Premises, including without limitation a property
manager at the Premises.  Such personnel shall be deemed agents or employees as
the case may be of Agent and not of Owner if such persons or agents are
employees of some party to this Agreement.  Owner shall have no right to
supervise or direct such agents or employees.  Agent shall have the right to
determine all salaries, wages and other compensation of personnel employed by
Agent hereunder; provided, that such salaries and wages are within the limits

                                      4


<PAGE>   5

approved budget.  Agent shall be reimbursed by Owner for all  wages, fringe
benefits, payroll taxes, union welfare and pension costs and worker's
compensation premiums paid by Agent to its employees or independent contractors
to the extent their services are attributable to the maintenance and operation
of the Premises, and to the extent such payments are included in the approved
budget submitted by Agent.

     5.  Compensation
                          
     5.1 Management.  Owner shall pay Agent as compensation for management
services rendered hereunder $1,500 per month or four percent (4%) of the
monthly gross receipts from the operation of the Premises during the term of
this Agreement, whichever is the greater amount.  Gross receipts are all
amounts received from the operation of the Premises, including, but not limited
to, rents, parking fees, forfeited security deposits, and other fees.

     5.2 Leasing.  Owner shall pay Agent as compensation for leasing services
rendered hereunder four percent (4%) of the total gross rental payments payable
by tenants during the initial term of leases procured by Agent, provided, if
another broker or leasing agent participates in the negotiation or procuring of
a lease, the commission payable to Agent with respect to such lease shall be
six percent (6%) of the total gross rental payments payable during the initial
term of any such lease.  Any additional compensation as if such lease were by a
new tenant.  The leasing commissions determined as set forth above shall be due
and payable in full on execution of the lease.

     Owner shall pay Agent additional compensation equal to two percent (2%)
of the gross rental payments payable by the tenant pursuant to any new lease
with an existing tenant procured by Agent, or any extension or renewal of a
lease by an existing tenant procured by Agent.  All such commissions shall be
due and payable in full upon execution of the new lease, extension or renewal,
as applicable.  On a tenant's exercise of any renewal option clause in a lease,
Agent shall receive a leasing commission on the same basis as if such exercise
were a renewal lease.

     Agent's right to receive and the obligation by Owner to pay leasing
commissions shall survive any termination of this Agreement.

     5.3 Fire or Casualty Restoration.  Agent's duties shall not include the
obligation to repair damage to the Premises caused by fire, wind, flood, or
other casualty if the cost of such repairs exceeds the sum of $1,000.  However,
if Agent hereafter agrees to supervise such repairs at Owner's request, Owner
shall pay Agent as additional compensation for supervising such repairs an
amount equal to ten percent (10%) of the gross expenses of repair.

capital improvement, renovation or rehabilitation approved by Owner an amount
equal to ten percent (10%) of the gross expenses incurred in any such capital
improvement, renovation or rehabilitation; provided that Owner requests that
Agent supervise and manage such renovations.

     6. Relationship of Agent to Owner.  Agent and Owner agree that Agent's
relationship to Owner is that of an independent contractor, that Agent is not
an employee of Owner, and that Agent and Owner are not partners or joint
venturers.
     
     7. Indemnification.  Owner agrees to indemnify and hold harmless Agent,
its representatives, agents and employees from any claim, loss, expense or
liability, including reasonable attorney's fees of counsel selected by Owner,
arising out of or in connection with the good faith performance of Agent's
duties under this Agreement or in connection with the Premises, except for

behalf of Owner shall be deposited in Agent's trust account as described below.

Premises.  All monies deposited by Agent from time to time shall be deemed to
be trust funds and shall be and remain the property of Owner and shall be
disbursed by Agent for the account of Owner only as permitted by this
Agreement.  Agent may endorse any and all checks drawn to the order of Owner
for deposit in the trust account.  Owner shall at its expense cause a

account at all times for payment of anticipated operating expenses.

trust account described in Paragraph 3.6 hereof.  Owner agrees that should
Agent make expenditures in excess of such  balance performing its duties, Owner
shall promptly

Premises; provided that such contracts are terminable with thirty (30) days
written notice by either party, or otherwise agreed to in writing by Owner.

     4.3 Lease Agreements.  Agent shall have the power and authority to enter
into lease agreements on behalf of Owner as principal, and to institute and

amounts received from the operation of the Premises, including, but not limited
to, rents, parking fees, forfeited security deposits, and other fees.

     5.2 Leasing.  Owner shall pay Agent as compensation for leasing services
rendered hereunder four percent (4%) of the total gross rental payments payable

     Owner shall pay Agent additional compensation equal to two percent (2%)

     12. Insurance.  Throughout the term of this Agreement, Owner shall at its
expense carry and maintain upon and with respect to the Premises:  general
