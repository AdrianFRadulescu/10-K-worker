                                    PART I

ITEM 1.                    DESCRIPTION OF BUSINESS

General

Windmere Corporation (the "Company") is engaged principally in
manufacturing and distributing a wide variety of personal care, kitchen
electric and seasonal products. The Company designs and manufactures its
products for sale to retail stores, distributors and professional beauty
supply customers located primarily in the United States, Canada and
Europe, with additional distribution in Latin America and the Far East.
The Company's products are sold largely under its Windmere trade name,
as well as under other trade names, trademarks and private labels.  The
Company also manufactures products on a contract basis for others.  

The Company's products are primarily manufactured by Durable Electrical
Metal Factory, Ltd. ("Durable"), its wholly-owned Hong Kong subsidiary,
in Bao An County, Guandong Province of the People's Republic of China
("People's Republic"), which is approximately 60 miles northwest of
central Hong Kong.  The Company has a significant amount of its assets
in the People's Republic, primarily consisting of inventory, equipment
and molds.  Substantially all of the Company's products are manufactured
by Durable and unrelated factories in the People's Republic. 
Approximately 85% to 90% of the Company's products are manufactured by
Durable.  The supply and cost of these products can be adversely
affected, among other reasons, by changes in foreign currency exchange
rates, increased import duties, imposition of tariffs, imposition of
import quotas, interruptions in sea or air transportation and political
or economic changes.  From time to time, the Company explores
opportunities to diversify its sourcing and/or production of certain
products to other low-cost locations or with other third parties or
joint venture partners in order to reduce its dependence on production
in the People's Republic and/or reduce Durable's dependence on the
Company's existing distribution base.  However, at the present time, the
Company intends to continue its production in the People's Republic.

In June 1989, the People's Republic experienced civil disturbances and,
although such disturbances have dissipated since that time, there
continues to be pressure for political reform.  No assurance can be
given, however, that civil disturbances will not recur.  If it becomes
necessary to relocate the Company's manufacturing facilities from the
People's Republic as a result of civil disturbances in that country or
otherwise, the Company believes the production currently conducted in
the People's Republic could be relocated to other Far East locations,
including Hong Kong, or other low-cost manufacturing locations, with
only temporary disruption and delay in such production and possible
short-term operating and capital losses, provided that the Company is
able to move substantially all of its manufacturing equipment and other
assets currently in the People's Republic to another location.  If the
Company is unable to remove such assets, due to confiscation,
expropriation, nationalization, embargoes or governmental restrictions,
it would incur substantial operating and capital losses, including
losses resulting from business disruption and delays in production.  In
addition, as a result of a relocation of its manufacturing equipment and
certain other assets, the Company would likely incur relatively higher
manufacturing costs.  A relocation could also adversely affect the
Company's revenues if the demand for the Company's products currently
manufactured in the People's Republic decreases due to a disruption in
the production and delivery of such products or due to higher prices
which might result from increased manufacturing costs.  Furthermore,
earnings could be adversely affected due to reduced sales and/or the
Company's inability to maintain its current margins on the products
currently manufactured in the People's Republic.

In 1995, President Clinton extended the People's Republic's most-
favored-nation (MFN) trading status for an additional year, beginning
July 3, 1995. The President announced in 1994 that the United States
would, in the future, permanently de-link MFN renewal from human rights
issues, other than freedom of emigration provisions.  Under U.S. law,
MFN status means that products are subject to the relatively low duty
rates set forth in Column 1 of the Harmonized Tariff Schedules of the
United States (HTSUS), that have resulted from several rounds of
reciprocal tariff negotiations conducted under the auspices of the
General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) since 1945.  Products from
countries not eligible for MFN treatment are subject to much higher
rates of duty, averaging 30 percent ad valorem, as set forth in Column
2 of the HTSUS.  If MFN status for goods produced in the People's
Republic were removed, there would be a substantial increase in tariffs
imposed on goods of Chinese origin entering the United States, including
those manufactured by the Company, which could have a material adverse
impact on the Company's revenues and earnings.

The Company was incorporated under the laws of the State of Florida in
1963.  As used herein, the term "Company" refers to Windmere Corporation
and its subsidiaries, unless the context indicates otherwise.  The
Company's executive offices are located at 5980 Miami Lakes Drive, Miami
Lakes, Florida 33014, (see Item 2. Properties), and its telephone number
is (305) 362-2611.

Products

The major portion of the Company's revenues are generated by the sale of
personal care products.  The Company's personal care products include
hair dryers, curling irons, curling brushes, hairsetters, combs and
brushes, shears, mirrors and electric shavers.  

The Company's appliances include toasters, toaster ovens, can openers,
blenders, hand mixers, waffle irons, steam irons, electronic air
cleaners, fans and air fresheners.

In 1995, 1994 and 1993, net sales of personal care products and
appliances represented approximately 63% and 37%, 70% and 30%, and 74%
and 26%, respectively, of the Company's total net sales.

Marketing and Distribution

Distribution: 

The Company's products are sold principally by independent sales
representatives.  The Company utilizes media advertising, cooperative
advertising and collateral materials to promote its products.  

The Company's products are sold under various federal trademarks and
registrations, some of which include:  Windmere, Jumbo Curl, Belson Pro,
Curlmaster, Design Pro, First Class Gourmet, Solid Gold, Hot'n Steamy,
Windmere Salon, Steam Express, Air Moves, ESP, Electric Shock
Protection, VIP Pro, Setting Pretty, Skinni Mini, Clothes Shaver, Easy
Styler, Four Way Curls, Set Up, All Curl Trio, Mirror Go Lightly,
Jerdon, First Class, Plak Trac, Litter Maid, Smoke Catcher, Curly Top,
Prelude, High Fashion, Belson, Pro Touch, Pro Star, Hot Silver, Golden
Touch, Profiles, Comare, Salon Designs, Premiere, Espree, Gold'n Hot and
Gentle Air.  The Company believes that its business has not been
materially dependent on any one such trademark.

The Company's distribution businesses include the sale of consumer
products and professional salon products primarily in the United States,
Canada and Europe.  Consumer products are primarily sold under the
Windmere brand and professional salon products are sold under the Belson
Products and Comare brands.  In addition, private label and controlled
label sales are made by the Company.
  
In the United States, the Company wholesales its line of consumer
products nationwide to retailers, including department stores, drug
chains, catalog stores and discount and variety stores.  The Company
also markets its consumer and professional salon appliances, hair pieces
and a wide variety of brushes and other hair care accessories to
beauticians, barbers and stylists through distributors.  In addition,
certain items, including the Company's hair dryers, curling irons and
other personal care appliances, are sold through professional beauty and
barber retail store outlets.         

The Company owns a 50% interest in a joint venture, Paragon Industries,
which distributes electric fans and other seasonal products manufactured
by Durable and unaffiliated third parties.  At December 31, 1995, this
investment had a negative book value of $.8 million and there were no
significant contingent liabilities arising from such investment.

Manufacturing:

The Company's manufacturing business is conducted by Durable.  Durable,
through its twenty-four year relationship with the Company, has produced
an extensive product line, which includes not only the appliances sold
to the Company and its customers and a substantial amount of oscillating
fans for a joint venture, but it has also become a contract manufacturer
for a range of products, such as toasters, steam irons, toaster ovens,
can openers, blenders, hand mixers and waffle irons, which it sells
primarily to customers in the United States, Canada and  Europe.  Some
of its customers are Rival, Salton-Maxim and Sunbeam.

In February 1996, the Company announced the signing of an agreement
whereby it would acquire a 50% ownership in Salton-Maxim, a designer and
marketer of small kitchen appliances and beauty care products. The
transaction, which is subject to a number of conditions, is expected to
close in June 1996.
 
Manufacturing and Supplies

The Company's foreign sales and operations are subject to the usual
risks incident to operating abroad, including currency fluctuations,
political conditions and changes in foreign laws.  A weakening or
strengthening of the United States dollar may result in higher or lower
cost of goods for the Company from suppliers in countries whose exchange
rate does not parallel the United States dollar, unlike Hong Kong the
currency of which fluctuates substantially parallel to the United States
dollar.

The Company generates approximately 85% to 90% of its revenues from
products manufactured by Durable in the People's Republic.  Such
products utilize raw materials available from at least two and as many
as nine or more independent suppliers.  The Company has no material
dependence on any single foreign source for such materials.

Seasonality

The Company's business is generally seasonal.  The Company has
historically experienced higher revenues in the third and fourth
quarters of each fiscal year primarily due to increased demand by
customers for the Company's products in the late summer for "back to
school" sales and in the fall for Christmas sales.  In typical years,
the Company begins to accumulate inventory for its major selling season
in June and July and it continues to purchase products at accelerated
rates until November.  The Company's major sales occur during August
through November.  Sales are generally made on 60 to 90 day terms. 
Heaviest collections on its open accounts receivable are received from
November through March, at which time the Company is in its most liquid
state.

Backlog

The Company's backlog of orders as of December 31, 1995, 1994 and 1993
was approximately $22.2 million, $20.1 million and $17.7 million,
respectively, which orders are generally shipped within the next
succeeding year.

Competition

The Company encounters significant competition with respect to all of
its products.   Although the Company's prices for products distributed
under its labels are in general below or competitive with those of many
nationally advertised brands, the Company also competes through quality
of product, attractive packaging, breadth of product lines, speed of
delivery and maintenance of good customer relations.  Many of the
Company's major competitors are substantially larger, have greater
financial and other resources and spend more for national advertising. 
Some of the Company's competitors include Conair, Helen of Troy and
Remington.

Regulation

In the United States, Canada and Europe, most federal, state, provincial
and local authorities require Underwriters Laboratory, Inc. ("UL") or
other safety regulation certification prior to marketing electrical
appliances in those jurisdictions.  All of the non-professional salon
appliances marketed by the Company have such certifications.  The
Company endeavors to have most of its products designed to meet those
requirements and to be so certified, although there can be no assurance
that those products, or additional electrical appliances which may be
developed by the Company, will meet such specifications.  Certain of the
products sold by the Company in the United States are subject to the
cosmetic purity and labelling provisions of the Fair Packaging and
Labelling Act.  The Company believes that in addition to  complying with
the Fair Packaging and Labelling Act, it complies with the applicable
rules and regulations of the Federal Trade Commission and other
municipal agencies with respect to, among other things, the content of
advertising and other trade practices.

Patents

Although the Company does not believe that its business is materially
dependent upon patents and patent protection, from time to time, new
products have been introduced with unique features for which the Company
has filed or obtained licenses for patents and design registrations in
the United States and in several foreign countries.

Employees

At March 1, 1996, the Company's distribution businesses in the United
States, Canada, Europe and Hong Kong employed approximately 250 
persons.  Durable's operations in Hong Kong and the People's Republic of
China employed approximately 10,000 persons.  The Company enjoys
satisfactory working relations with these employees.  The Company is not
a party to any collective bargaining agreement.

Geographic Area Financial Information

Incorporated by reference to the Company's 1995 Annual Report to
Shareholders, under the caption, "Note M to Consolidated Financial
Statements, Geographic Area Information".  Included as part of Exhibit
13.

Item 2.  PROPERTIES

The executive offices of the Company, from which a significant amount of
its business activities are conducted, are currently located at 5980
Miami Lakes Drive, Miami Lakes, Florida.  All of the space in this two-
story office and warehouse facility is owned and occupied by the
Company.  The Company also utilizes the services of public warehouses
located in Reno, Nevada and Memphis, Tennessee pursuant to short-term
contracts.

Durable owns approximately 50,000 sq. ft. of office space in Hong Kong,
of which 30,000 sq. ft. is used for its and the Company's trading
companies' headquarters.  Durable also utilizes facilities of 1,600,000
sq. ft. in the People's Republic which it operates under contracts with
the local government.  The contracts require such periodic adjustments
that terms of between one and five years exist at all times.  Certain
facilities have contract terms extending beyond five years. 

ITEM 3.  LEGAL PROCEEDINGS

In April 1994, Kabushiki Kaisha Izumi Seiki Seisakusho, a Japanese
corporation ("Izumi"), filed an action against the Company, David M.
Friedson, the President and Chief Executive Officer of the Company, U.S.
Philips Corporation, North American Philips Corporation and N.V. Philips
Gloellampenfabrieken (together, "Philips").  This action concerns the
1992 settlement (the "Philips Settlement") of certain claims, primarily
a Federal antitrust claim, made by the Company against Philips, which
resulted in an $89,644,257 judgment in favor of the Company.  Pursuant
to the Philips Settlement, Philips paid the Company $57,000,000 in May
1992.  As part of the Philips Settlement, the Company and Philips agreed
that the Company's money judgment against Philips in connection with
such antitrust litigation would be vacated.  Izumi is claiming, among
other things, that the Philips Settlement, including the agreement with
Philips to cooperate to vacate the related judgment in favor of the
Company, constitutes a breach by the Company of a customary
indemnification agreement between Izumi (as seller of goods) and the
Company (as buyer of goods) dated February 20, 1984.  This
indemnification agreement covered certain claims against the Company and
was entered into more than eight months prior to the commencement of the
Philips litigation in connection with the routine purchase by the
Company of goods from Izumi.  Izumi advanced certain legal fees and
costs to the Company in connection with the Philips litigation.  Izumi
is further claiming that it is entitled to recover from the Company an
unspecified portion of the Philips Settlement, punitive damages and
reimbursement of litigation and other related costs and expenses.  The
Company disagrees with Izumi's position and believes that it has
meritorious defenses to these claims by Izumi. A pre-answer motion by
the Company has resulted in the dismissal of some of Izumi's claims, and
the Company has answered the remaining claims. The Company intends to
defend this action fully and vigorously.

In addition, in June 1995, Izumi filed another lawsuit against the
Company and Philips.  In this second lawsuit, Izumi sought equitable
relief in the form of reinstatement of the 1990 judgments in the
Company's favor against Philips, which were vacated.  This complaint was
amended to include Sears, Roebuck and Co. ("Sears") as a co-plaintiff
and to seek reinstatement of an unfair competition judgment only.  In
December 1995, this second lawsuit was dismissed by the Court. Izumi and
Sears filed notices of appeal, but subsequently withdrew the appeal.   

The Company is also subject to other legal proceedings, product
liability and other claims which arise in the ordinary course of its
business.  In the opinion of management, the amount of ultimate
liability, if any, in excess of applicable insurance coverage, is not
likely to have a material effect on the financial position of the
Company. However, as the outcome of litigation or other legal claims is
difficult to predict, significant changes in the estimated exposures
could occur.

ITEM 7.   MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND
          RESULTS OF OPERATIONS
           
Results of Operations
Year Ended December 31, 1995 compared with Year Ended December 31, 1994

Net Sales

Net sales were $187.8 million and $181.1 million for the years ended
December 31, 1995 and 1994, respectively. Manufacturing sales increased by
$14.4 million due to increased shipments of kitchen electric appliances.
Distribution sales declined by $7.7 million primarily due to the weak U.S.
retailing environment in 1995. Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. and a kitchen electric
appliance distributor accounted for 13.1% and 11.4%, respectively, of the
Company's 1995 sales.
    
Set forth below is a table indicating the revenues that the Company derived
from its distribution and manufacturing operations for the periods
indicated:
 
                          Year Ended December 31,
                             1995                      1994
Distribution   $147,576,000   79%       $155,320,600    86%
Manufacturing    40,200,900   21          25,791,600    14
  Total Sales  $187,776,900  100%       $181,112,200   100%

Gross Profit Margin

The Company's gross margin percentage decreased in 1995 to 21.8% of sales
from the 27.0% level in the prior year due to higher raw materials costs
which could not be passed on to customers and the greater concentration of
lower-margin manufacturing sales. 

Selling, General and Administrative Expenses 

Selling, general and administrative expenses as a percentage of sales were
20.0% and 19.6% in 1995 and 1994, respectively. The Company's higher
aggregate operating expenses were primarily a result of increased bad debt
expense and inventory storage costs.

Unusual or Non-Recurring Items

In 1995, the Company incurred a non-recurring pre-tax loss of $8.0 million
on the sale of an other asset. This transaction reduced 1995 net earnings
by $5.3 million, or $.31 per share, on an after-tax basis. 

Equity in Net Earnings (Loss) of Joint Ventures

The Company's equity in net earnings (loss) of joint ventures was $(.4)
million and $.1 million in 1995 and 1994, respectively.  Lower gross
margins in 1995, due to higher raw materials costs, produced the decline in
the joint venture's earnings.

Taxes

The Company's tax expense is based on the earnings of each of its foreign
and domestic operations and it includes such additional U.S. taxes as are
applicable to the repatriation of foreign earnings.  Offshore earnings
generally are taxed at rates lower than in the United States. The Company
made a provision in its 1995 second quarter of $.4 million, or $.02 per
share, as a result of its settlement of a Hong Kong tax audit.

Earnings Per Share

The average number of common shares and common equivalent shares used in
computing per share results was 2.1% lower in 1995 primarily as a result of
a lower dilutive effect from unexercised stock options and warrants, due
both to a decline in the quoted market price of the Company's common stock
during the year and the Company's fourth quarter loss.

Year Ended December 31, 1994 compared with Year Ended December 31, 1993

Net Sales

Net sales were $181.1 million and $170.7 million for the years ended
December 31, 1994 and 1993, respectively.  The higher sales volume was
produced by the Company's distribution businesses on increased unit
shipments of core products.  The sales increase was almost evenly divided
between shipments to retailers and professional beauty supply customers.
Manufacturing sales by Durable were relatively unchanged, as 1994's growth
in sales of kitchen electric appliances offset a $6.5 million decline in
sales of electric fragrance units.  Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. accounted for
17.8% of the Company's 1994 sales.

Set forth below is a table indicating the revenues that the Company derived
from its distribution and manufacturing operations for the periods
indicated:
 
                          Year Ended December 31,
                       1994                       1993
Distribution   $155,320,600   86%       $144,609,600    85%
Manufacturing    25,791,600   14          26,051,800    15
  Total Sales  $181,112,200  100%       $170,661,400   100%

Gross Profit Margin

The Company's gross profit margin declined in 1994 to 27.0% of sales from
the 28.1% level in the prior year.  The lower gross margin resulted
primarily from three factors.  The Company experienced the effects of
higher raw materials prices in the second half of 1994.  In addition,
growth in kitchen electric appliance sales was achieved at lower than
normal margins in order to establish a market presence.  Finally, while
manufacturing sales were level for both years, electric fragrance unit
sales, which had higher margins, were significantly lower in 1994. 

Selling, General and Administrative Expenses 

Selling, general and administrative expenses as a percentage of sales were
19.6% and 21.4% in 1994 and 1993, respectively.  The Company's lower
aggregate operating expenses were primarily a result of reduced advertising
costs and legal expenses. 


Unusual or Non-Recurring Items

In 1994, the Company recorded an unusual and non-recurring gain of $7.8
million on the sale of 60,000 square feet of office space in Hong Kong.  No
taxes were provided as the gain is not taxable.

Equity in Net Earnings (Loss) of Joint Ventures

The Company's equity in net earnings (loss) of joint ventures, excluding
the results of a joint venture sold in August 1993, was $.1 million and
$(.3) million in 1994 and 1993, respectively.  Higher sales and gross
margins in 1994 produced the improved earnings.

Taxes

The Company's tax expense is based on the earnings of each of its foreign
and domestic operations and it includes such additional U.S. taxes as are
applicable to the repatriation of foreign earnings.  Offshore earnings
generally are taxed at rates lower than in the United States.  Non-
recurring transactions in 1994 and 1993 lowered the Company's effective tax
rate by 5.9 percentage points in each of those years.

Earnings Per Share

The average number of common shares and common equivalent shares used in
computing per share results was 8.5% higher in 1994 primarily as a result
of the 1,000,000 shares issued to acquire the additional 20% interest in
Durable, the exercise of stock options and warrants, as well as a higher
dilutive effect from unexercised stock options and warrants due to
increases in the quoted market price of the Company's common stock during
most of 1994.  The purchase and retirement of 397,400 common shares
produced only a small reduction in the annual weighted average shares total
because these purchases occurred late in 1994.
                  
Liquidity & Capital Resources

At December 31, 1995, the Company's working capital was $127.6 million, a
decrease of $1.7 million since the end of 1994.  At the end of 1995, 1994
and 1993, the Company's current ratio was 7.5 to 1, 7.0 to 1 and 5.8 to 1,
respectively, and its quick ratio was 3.5 to 1, 3.6 to 1 and 3.1 to 1,
respectively.    

Cash and cash equivalents increased by $4.8 million during 1995.  Cash of
$13.4 million was provided from operating activities, which included the
refund of $3.0 million that had been deposited as security in connection
with a Hong Kong tax audit. The Company utilized approximately $13.1
million of cash this year to finance higher inventory levels and for the
acquisition of fixed assets. In 1995, the Company purchased and retired
139,600 shares of its common stock at a cost of $1.0 million. Cash
dividends of $3.4 million were paid to shareholders in 1995. In January
1996, the Company used $2.6 million to purchase and retire 356,500 shares
of its common stock, bringing the total number of shares purchased under a
1,000,000 share authorization to 893,500, at an aggregate cost of $7.5
million. 

The Company's foreign subsidiaries (the "subsidiaries") have $6.4 million
in trade finance lines of credit, payable on demand, which are secured by
the subsidiaries' tangible and intangible property located in Hong Kong and
in the People's Republic of China, as well as a Company guarantee.  At
December 31, 1995, the subsidiaries were utilizing, including letters of
credit, approximately $.6 million of these credit lines, leaving a
remaining funding capacity of $5.8 million.  These subsidiaries also have
available an additional $5.0 million line of credit which is supported by a
domestic standby letter of credit, which credit line was not being used at
December 31, 1995.

The Company has a $20.0 million demand line of credit from a domestic bank,
which is secured by domestic accounts receivable.  At December 31, 1995,
there were no outstanding borrowings under this credit line.  

No provision for U.S. taxes has been made on undistributed earnings of the
Company's foreign subsidiaries and joint ventures because management plans
to reinvest such earnings in their respective operations or in other
foreign operations.  Repatriating those earnings or using them in some
other manner which would give rise to a U.S. tax liability would reduce
after tax earnings and available working capital.  

The Company believes that its cash on hand and internally generated funds,
together with its credit lines, will provide sufficient funding to meet the
Company's capital requirements and its operating needs for the foreseeable
future.

Legal Proceedings

In April 1994, Kabushiki Kaisha Izumi Seiki Seisakusho, a Japanese
corporation ("Izumi"), filed an action against the Company, David M.
Friedson, the President and Chief Executive Officer of the Company, U.S.
Philips Corporation, North American Philips Corporation and N.V. Philips
Gloellampenfabrieken (together, "Philips").  This action concerns the 1992
settlement (the "Philips Settlement") of certain claims, primarily a
Federal antitrust claim, made by the Company against Philips, which
resulted in an $89,644,257 judgment in favor of the Company.  Pursuant to
the Philips Settlement, Philips paid the Company $57,000,000 in May 1992. 
As part of the Philips Settlement, the Company and Philips agreed that the
Company's money judgment against Philips in connection with such antitrust
litigation would be vacated.  Izumi is claiming, among other things, that
the Philips Settlement, including the agreement with Philips to cooperate
to vacate the related judgment in favor of the Company, constitutes a
breach by the Company of a customary indemnification agreement between
Izumi (as seller of goods) and the Company (as buyer of goods) dated
February 20, 1984.  This indemnification agreement covered certain claims
against the Company and was entered into more than eight months prior to
the commencement of the Philips litigation in connection with the routine
purchase by the Company of goods from Izumi.  Izumi advanced certain legal
fees and costs to the Company in connection with the Philips litigation. 
Izumi is further claiming that it is entitled to recover from the Company
an unspecified portion of the Philips Settlement, punitive damages and
reimbursement of litigation and other related costs and expenses.  The
Company disagrees with Izumi's position and believes that it has
meritorious defenses to these claims by Izumi.  A pre-answer motion by the
Company has resulted in the dismissal of some of Izumi's claims, and the
Company has answered the remaining claims.  The Company intends to defend
this action fully and vigorously.

In addition, in June 1995, Izumi filed another lawsuit against the Company
and Philips.  In this second lawsuit, Izumi sought equitable relief in the
form of reinstatement of the 1990 judgments in the Company's favor against
Philips, which were vacated.  This complaint was amended to include Sears,
Roebuck and Co. ("Sears") as a co-plaintiff and to seek reinstatement of an
unfair competition judgment only.  In December 1995, this second lawsuit
was dismissed by the Court. Izumi and Sears filed notices of appeal, but
subsequently withdrew the appeal.     

The Company is also subject to other legal proceedings, product liability
and other claims which arise in the ordinary course of its business.  In
the opinion of management, the amount of ultimate liability, if any, in
excess of applicable insurance coverage, is not likely to have a material
effect on the financial position of the Company. However, as the outcome of
litigation or other legal claims is difficult to predict, significant
changes in the estimated exposures could occur.

Manufacturing Operations

The Company's products are primarily manufactured by Durable, its wholly-
owned Hong Kong subsidiary, in Bao An County, Guandong Province of the
People's Republic of China, which is approximately 60 miles northwest of
central Hong Kong.  The Company has a significant amount of its assets in
the People's Republic, primarily consisting of inventory, equipment and
molds.  Substantially all of the Company's products are manufactured by
Durable and unrelated factories in the People's Republic.  Approximately
85% to 90% of the Company's revenues are currently derived from products
manufactured by Durable.  The supply and cost of these products, as well as
finished products, can be adversely affected, among other reasons, by
changes in foreign currency exchange rates, increased import duties,
imposition of tariffs, imposition of import quotas, interruptions in sea or
air transportation and political or economic changes. From time to time,
the Company explores opportunities to diversify its sourcing and/or
production of certain products to other low-cost locations or with other
third parties or joint venture partners in order to reduce its dependence
on production in the People's Republic and/or reduce Durable's dependence
on the Company's existing distribution base.  However, at the present time,
the Company intends to continue its production in the People's Republic.

In June 1989, the People's Republic experienced civil disturbances and,
although such disturbances have dissipated since that time, there continues
to be pressure for political reform.  No assurance can be given, however,
that civil disturbances will not recur.  If it becomes necessary to
relocate the Company's manufacturing facilities from the People's Republic
as a result of civil disturbances in that country or otherwise, the Company
believes the production currently conducted in the People's Republic could
be relocated to other Far East locations, including Hong Kong, or other
low-cost manufacturing locations, with only temporary disruption and delay
in such production and possible short-term operating and capital losses,
provided that the Company is able to move substantially all of its
manufacturing equipment and other assets currently in the People's Republic
to another location.  If the Company is unable to remove such assets, due
to confiscation, expropriation, nationalization, embargoes or governmental
restrictions, it would incur substantial operating and capital losses,
including losses resulting from business disruption and delays in pro-
duction. In addition, as a result of a relocation of its manufacturing
equipment and certain other assets, the Company would likely incur
relatively higher manufacturing costs.  A relocation could also adversely
affect the Company's revenues if the demand for the Company's products
currently manufactured in the People's Republic decreases due to a dis-
ruption in the production and delivery of such products or due to higher
prices which might result from increased manufacturing costs.  Furthermore,
earnings could be adversely affected due to reduced sales and/or the
Company's inability to maintain its current margins on the products
currently manufactured in the People's Republic.

Board of Directors and Stockholders
Windmere Corporation

We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Windmere
Corporation and Subsidiaries (the "Company") as of December 31, 1995 and
1994, and the related consolidated statements of operations, stockholders'
equity and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended
December 31, 1995.  These financial statements are the responsibility of
the Company's management.  Our responsibility is to express an opinion on
these financial statements based on our audits.

We conducted our audits in accordance with generally accepted auditing
standards.  Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to
obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free
of material misstatement.  An audit includes examining, on a test basis,
evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial
statements.  An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles
used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating
the overall financial statement presentation.  We believe that our audits
provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.

In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present fairly,
in all material respects, the consolidated financial position of Windmere
Corporation and Subsidiaries at December 31, 1995 and 1994, and the
consolidated results of their operations and their consolidated cash flows
for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 1995, in
conformity with generally accepted accounting principles.

We have also audited Schedule II of Windmere Corporation and Subsidiaries
for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 1995.  In our
opinion, this schedule presents fairly, in all material respects, the
information required to be set forth therein.

                       AND AMENDED AND RESTATED NOTE


     THIS AMENDMENT NO. 1 TO AMENDED AND RESTATED LETTER AGREEMENT
AND AMENDED AND RESTATED NOTE (the "Amendment") dated March 1,
1996, is made by and between WINDMERE CORPORATION, a Florida
corporation (the "Borrower"), and NATIONSBANK, NATIONAL ASSOCIATION
(SOUTH) (successor by merger of NationsBank of Florida, National
Association), a national banking association, (the "Bank").

                           W I T N E S S E T H:

     WHEREAS, the Bank by an Amended and Restated Letter Agreement
dated as of July 28, 1995 (the "Agreement"), has agreed to make
available and has made available to Borrower a working capital loan
of up to $20,000,000, reducing at December 31, 1995 to $10,000,000,
and a letter of credit facility of up to $5,000,000; and

     WHEREAS, the Borrower has requested that the Bank reinstate
the additional $10,000,000 of the working capital facility which
reduced at December 31, 1995 upon the same terms and conditions
existing prior to December 31, 1995 and the Bank is willing to
reinstate such amount;

     NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the mutual covenants,
promises and conditions herein set forth, it is hereby agreed as
follows:

     1.   The terms "Agreement" and "Note" as used herein and in
the Agreement, the Note and the other Loan Documents (as defined in
the "Agreement") shall mean the Agreement and the Note as hereby
amended and modified.  Unless the context otherwise requires, all
capitalized terms used herein and in the other Loan Documents
without definition shall have the respective meanings provided
therefor in the Agreement, as hereby amended.

     2.   Subject to the conditions set forth in paragraph 5
hereof, the Agreement shall be and hereby is amended, effective as
of March 1, 1996, as follows:

          (a)  The second sentence of the first paragraph of the
     Agreement is amended to read as follows:

          "The Borrower has requested that the Bank increase the
          amount of the revolving loan to the principal amount of
          $20,000,000 and that the Bank increase the letter of
          credit facility to $10,000,000 to the Borrower."

          (b)  Paragraph 5 of the Agreement is hereby amended in
     its entirety so that as amended it shall read as follows:

               "5.  Reinstatement.  The Committed Amount shall
          automatically be increased, effective March 1, 1996, from
          $10,000,000 to $20,000,000 and the Note shall be deemed
          amended to reflect a Maximum Amount of $20,000,000 from
          and after March 1, 1996."

          (c)  Paragraph 6 of the Agreement is hereby amended in
     its entirety so that as amended it shall read as follows:

               "6.  Unused Fee.  For the period beginning on the
          date hereof and ending on the Termination Date (excluding
          however the period from January 1, 1996 through February
          29, 1996), the Borrower will pay to the Bank an unused
          fee equal to one quarter of a percent (1/4%) per annum
          multiplied by the amount by which the Committed Amount
          exceeds the greater of (i) $10,000,000 or (ii) the daily
          amount of (A) the aggregate undrawn amount of Standby
          Letters of Credit and (B) Loans outstanding.  The unused
          fee shall be calculated on a basis of a year of 360 days
          for actual days elapsed and shall be payable quarterly in
          arrears on the last day of each September, December,
          March and June."

          (d)  Exhibit E to the Agreement is amended in its
     entirety so that as amended it reads as attached hereto.

     3.   The Note shall be and hereby is amended, effective as of
March, 1996 in order to define on page one the term "Maximum
Amount" to read as follows:

          "Maximum Amount:  $20,000,000"

     4.   Each of the Domestic Subsidiaries of the Borrower who has
previously delivered a Guaranty to the Bank has joined in the
execution of this Amendment Agreement for the purpose of consenting
to this Amendment Agreement and affirming its respective guaranty
of the obligations of Borrower arising under the Agreement as
amended by this Amendment Agreement.

     5.   The Borrower hereby represents and warrants to the Agent
and the Bank that as of the date hereof the Agreement has been re-
examined by the Borrower and:

          (i)  The representations and warranties made by the
     Borrower therein and in the other Loan Documents are true,
     complete and correct in all material respects on and as of the
     date hereof, are hereby reaffirmed, and shall survive the
     execution and delivery of the Amendment Agreement;

         (ii)  The execution, delivery and performance of this
     Amendment Agreement will not conflict with or result in the
     breach of any of the provisions of, or cause a default under,
     the Articles of Incorporation or Bylaws of the Borrower, or
     any applicable law, rule or regulation, or any judgment,
     order, writ, injunction or decree of any court, administrative
     agency or other government instrumentality to which the
     Borrower or any Subsidiary is subject or any agreement or
     instrument to which the Borrower or any Subsidiary is a party,
     the effect of which would have any material adverse effect on
     the ability of the Borrower or any Guarantor to observe the
     covenants and agreements contained in the Agreement, as
     amended hereby, or in any other Loan Document or to pay the
     obligations arising under the Agreement and the Guaranty, and
     will not result in the creation or imposition of any security
     interest, lien, charge or encumbrance on any of the assets of
     the Borrower or any Subsidiary. 

     6.   As conditions to the effectiveness of this Amendment
Agreement there shall not have occurred either (i) any Default or
Event of Default which shall not have been waived or (ii) any
material adverse change in the business, financial condition or
operations of the Borrower or any Subsidiary since September 30,
1995.

     7.   This Amendment Agreement sets forth the entire
understanding and agreement of the parties hereto in relation to
the subject matter hereof and supersedes any prior negotiations and
agreements among the parties relative to such subject matter.  No
promise, condition, representation or warranty, express or implied,
not herein set forth shall bind any party hereto, and none of them
has relied on any such promise, condition, representation or
warranty.  Each of the parties hereto acknowledges that, except as
in this Amendment Agreement otherwise expressly stated, no
representations, warranties or commitments, express or implied,
have been made by any party to the other. 

     8.   Except as specifically amended, modified or supplemented
by this Amendment Agreement, all of the other documents delivered
in connection with the Loans, as heretofore amended, are hereby
confirmed and ratified in all respects and shall remain in full
force and effect according to their respective terms.

     9.   Should any stamp or excise tax become payable under the
laws of the United States or of any state or any subdivision
thereof or municipality therein in respect of the Amendment
Agreement, the Borrower shall pay the same (including interest
penalties, if any) and shall hold the Bank and the Agent harmless
with respect thereto.  

     10.  This Amendment Agreement may be executed in any number of
counterparts, each of which shall be deemed to be an original as
against any party whose signature appears thereon, and all of which
shall together constitute one and the same instrument.

      IN WITNESS WHEREOF, the parties hereto have caused this
Amendment Agreement to be duly executed by their duly authorized
officers, all as of the day and year first above written.

   FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND REPORT
       OF INDEPENDENT CERTIFIED
          PUBLIC ACCOUNTANTS

         WINDMERE CORPORATION
           AND SUBSIDIARIES

      December 31, 1995 and 1994


Board of Directors and Stockholders
Windmere Corporation

We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Windmere
Corporation and Subsidiaries (the "Company") as of December 31, 1995 and
1994,   and   the   related  consolidated  statements   of   operations,
stockholders' equity and cash flows for each of the three years  in  the
period  ended  December 31, 1995.  These financial  statements  are  the
responsibility  of the Company's management.  Our responsibility  is  to
express an opinion on these financial statements based on our audits.

We  conducted our audits in accordance with generally accepted  auditing
standards. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to
obtain  reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements  are
free  of material misstatement.  An audit includes examining, on a  test
basis,  evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial
statements.  An audit also includes assessing the accounting  principles
used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating
the  overall  financial statement presentation.   We  believe  that  our
audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.

In  our  opinion,  the  financial statements referred  to  above  resent
fairly, in all material respects, the consolidated financial position of
Windmere Corporation and Subsidiaries at December 31, 1995 and 1994, and
the consolidated results of their operations and their consolidated cash
flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 1995,
in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles.

NOTE A - SUMMARY OF ACCOUNTING POLICIES

  Windmere  Corporation  and  Subsidiaries (the "Company")  is  principally
  engaged  in  the manufacture and sale of personal care, kitchen  electric
  and  seasonal products.  In preparing financial statements in  conformity
  with generally accepted accounting principles, management is required  to
  make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets
  and  liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and  liabilities
  at  the date of the financial statements and revenues and expenses during
  the  reporting period.  Actual results could differ from those estimates.
  A  summary  of the Company's significant accounting policies consistently
  applied  in  the  preparation of the accompanying consolidated  financial
  statements follows.

  Principles of Consolidation

  The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company
  and   its   wholly-owned   subsidiaries.    Intercompany   balances   and
  transactions  are eliminated in consolidation.  The Company reflects  its
  investment  in  its 50%-owned joint venture at cost plus  its  equity  in
  undistributed net earnings.

  Foreign Currency Translation

  Balance sheet accounts of the Company's foreign operations are translated
  at  the  exchange  rate in effect at each year end and  income  statement
  accounts  are translated at the average exchange rates prevailing  during
  the  year.   Adjustments  resulting from  this  translation  process  are
  accumulated in a separate component of stockholders' equity and  are  not
  included  in  the  determination of net earnings.  The Company's  foreign
  manufacturing  subsidiary utilizes the local currency as  its  functional
  currency, and the other foreign subsidiaries primarily utilize  the  U.S.
  dollar as their functional currency.

  Cash and Cash Equivalents
  Short-Term Investments

  The  Company  considers all highly liquid investments with maturities  of
  three  months  or  less at the time of purchase to be  cash  equivalents.
  Similar investments with maturities between three months and one year  at
  the time of purchase are classified as short-term investments.

  Inventories

  Inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market; cost is determined
  by  the  first-in,  first-out method.  Inventories are comprised  of  the
  following:

                                               1995        1994

     Raw materials                         $16,327,900   $18,993,200
     Work in process                        21,085,300    15,155,900
     Finished goods                         41,600,400    40,129,300

                                           $79,013,600   $74,278,400

  Receivables from Affiliates

  Receivables  from  affiliates arise primarily in the ordinary  course  of
  business, are interest bearing and are settled as trade obligations.

  Property, Plant and Equipment

  Depreciation  and amortization are provided for in amounts sufficient  to
  relate  the  cost  of  depreciable assets to  their  estimated  operating
  service lives using accelerated and straight-line methods.

  Intangible Assets

  Intangible assets, consisting primarily of goodwill, are being  amortized
  on  a  straight-line  basis over twenty years.   Intangible  assets  were
  $10,113,700  and $10,169,300 at December 31, 1995 and 1994, respectively,
  and  the  related accumulated amortization was $2,126,800 and $1,660,900,
  respectively.

  In 1994, the Company acquired the 20% interest in Durable that it did not
  already own.  The purchase price consisted of the delivery of one million
  shares  of the Company's common stock, valued at $8,000,000, and  a  cash
  payment  of  $10,000.  This acquisition was accounted for as a  purchase.
  Goodwill of $5,211,000 was recognized on the transaction.

  On an ongoing basis, management reviews the valuation and amortization of
  goodwill.   As part of this review, the Company estimates the  value  and
  future  benefits of the net income generated by the related  subsidiaries
  to determine that no impairment has occurred.

  In  March 1995, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued Statement
  121,  "Accounting for the Impairment of Long-Lived Assets and  for  Long-
  Lived  Assets  to Be Disposed Of."  This Statement had no impact  on  the
  Company's  results of operations or financial position upon  adoption  in
  January 1996.

  Fair Value of Financial Instruments

  The  carrying values of cash and cash equivalents, trade receivables  and
  accounts  payable approximate fair value due to the short-term maturities
  of these instruments.

  Income Taxes

  No  provision has been made for U.S. taxes on undistributed  earnings  of
  foreign subsidiaries and joint ventures of approximately $104,000,000  at
  December  31,  1995,  as  it is anticipated that such  earnings  will  be
  reinvested in their respective operations or in other foreign operations.

  Deferred  taxes have been provided on temporary differences in  reporting
  certain transactions for financial accounting and tax purposes.

  Deferred Income

  In 1992, the Company granted an exclusive license for the distribution of
  a  product. Deferred income of $1,340,600 resulted from this transaction,
  which will be reported as other income on a straight-line basis over  the
  five year license term.

  In 1988, the Company sold its Save-Way Beauty Supply stores for a gain of
  approximately $6,980,000, $3,300,000 of which was allocated to a ten-year
  covenant  not  to compete that is being amortized to other  income  on  a
  straight-line basis.

  Earnings Per Share

  Earnings  per share are based upon the weighted average number of  common
  shares  and common equivalent shares outstanding during each  year.   The
  total  number  of  such weighted average shares was 17,227,000  in  1995,
  17,589,000  in 1994, and 16,212,000 in 1993.  Stock options and  warrants
  are  considered common stock equivalents unless their inclusion would  be
  antidilutive.

  Stock Options

  Options granted under the Company's Stock Option Plans are accounted  for
  under  APB  25, "Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees,"  and  related
  interpretations.   In  November 1995, the Financial Accounting  Standards
  Board  issued  Statement 123, "Accounting for Stock-Based  Compensation,"
  which  will  require additional proforma disclosures for  companies  that
  will  continue to account for employee stock options under the  intrinsic
  value method specified in APB 25.  The Company plans to continue to apply
  APB  25 and the only effect of adopting Statement 123 in 1996 will be the
  new disclosure requirement.

  Reclassifications

  Certain  prior year amounts within the accompanying financial  statements
  have been reclassified for comparability.

NOTE B - UNUSUAL OR NON-RECURRING ITEMS

  In  1995, the Company incurred a non-recurring pre-tax loss of $8,000,000
  on  the  sale  of  an  other asset.  This transaction  reduced  1995  net
  earnings by $5,280,000, or $.31 per share, on an after-tax basis.

  In  1994,  Durable sold 60,000 square feet of office space in Hong  Kong,
  for  $9,500,000.   This transaction generated a non-recurring  profit  of
  $7,810,500,  or approximately $.45 per share.  No taxes were provided  as
  the gain was not taxable.

NOTE C - INVESTMENTS

  Investments are comprised of the following:

  In  the third quarter of 1995, the Company reached an agreement with  the
  Hong Kong Inland Revenue Department concerning the taxes assessed against
  the  Company's  consolidated Hong Kong subsidiaries  through  1991.   The
  assessment,  including  interest charges and  net  of  U.S.  foreign  tax
  credits,  approximates $1,400,000.  The Company made a provision  in  its
  1995  second  quarter  of  $400,000 or $.02 per share,  to  increase  its
  contingency reserve to the settlement  amount.  Security deposits of
  approximately  $3,000,000  were refunded to the Company during the fourth
  quarter of 1995.  Hong Kong tax returns for the fiscal years 1992 through
  1994 have also been audited and accepted  as filed.  The Internal Revenue
  Service is currently  examining the  Company's  1992 tax return.  To date,
  no material  adjustments  have been proposed.  Management believes that
  adequate provision for taxes has been made for the years under examination
  and those not yet examined.

  The  Company adopted Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 109,
  "Accounting  for  Income Taxes," on January 1, 1993,  which  changed  the
  Company's method of accounting for income taxes to an asset and liability
  approach.   The  cumulative  effect of  this  change  in  the  method  of
  accounting  for  income  taxes, after minority interest  in  the  portion
  relating to Durable, was a benefit of $1,731,100 or $.11 per share.   The
  cumulative  effect  adjustment primarily  consists  of  the  tax  benefit
  associated  with Durable's net operating loss carryforward.  A  valuation
  allowance  has  not  been  recorded  limiting  such  benefits  based   on
  management's  current estimate that future profits will be sufficient  to
  realize these benefits.  A valuation allowance for the entire tax benefit
  of  the  net  operating  losses primarily accumulated  by  the  Company's
  European  subsidiary  has  been provided  as  the  realizability  of  the
  benefits of such net operating losses is not assured.

  The primary components of future income tax benefits at December 31, 1995
  are as follows:

       Net operating loss carryforwards
         (net of valuation allowances of $171,000)        $   244,100
       Depreciation and amortization                           76,300
       Deferred income                                        513,300
       Differences in timing between financial
         and tax reporting                                  1,708,500
       Other                                                  170,900
                                                            2,713,100
       Less amount included in other assets                 1,070,200

                                                           $1,642,900


  The  tax benefits resulting from the exercise of stock options have  been
  recorded  as additions to paid-in capital in the amounts of $242,800  and
  $328,500 in 1995 and 1994, respectively.

NOTE J - COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES

  Litigation

  In  April  1994,  Kabushiki  Kaisha Izumi Seiki  Seisakusho,  a  Japanese
  corporation  ("Izumi"), filed an action against  the  Company,  David  M.
  Friedson, the President and Chief Executive Officer of the Company,  U.S.
  Philips  Corporation, North American Philips Corporation and N.V. Philips
  Gloellampenfabrieken  (together, "Philips").  This  action  concerns  the
  1992 settlement (the "Philips Settlement") of certain claims, primarily a
  Federal  antitrust  claim,  made by the Company  against  Philips,  which
  resulted in an $89,644,257 judgment in favor of the Company.  Pursuant to
  the Philips Settlement, Philips paid the Company $57,000,000 in May 1992.
  As  part  of the Philips Settlement, the Company and Philips agreed  that
  the  Company's  money  judgment against Philips in connection  with  such
  antitrust  litigation would be vacated.  Izumi is claiming,  among  other
  things, that the Philips Settlement, including the agreement with Philips
  to  cooperate  to  vacate the related judgment in favor of  the  Company,
  constitutes  a  breach  by  the  Company of a  customary  indemnification
  agreement between Izumi (as seller of goods) and the Company (as buyer of
  goods)  dated February 20, 1984.  This indemnification agreement  covered
  certain  claims against the Company and was entered into more than  eight
  months  prior to the commencement of the Philips litigation in connection
  with  the  routine  purchase by the Company of goods from  Izumi.   Izumi
  advanced  certain legal fees and costs to the Company in connection  with
  the Philips litigation.  Izumi is further claiming that it is entitled to
  recover   from  the  Company  an  unspecified  portion  of  the   Philips
  Settlement,  punitive damages and reimbursement of litigation  and  other
  related  costs and expenses.  The Company disagrees with Izumi's position
  and  believes that it has meritorious defenses to these claims by  Izumi.
  A  pre-answer motion by the Company has resulted in the dismissal of some
  of  Izumi's  claims, and the Company has answered the  remaining  claims.
  The Company intends to defend this action fully and vigorously.

  In  addition,  in  June  1995, Izumi filed another  lawsuit  against  the
  Company  and  Philips.   In this second lawsuit, Izumi  sought  equitable
  relief  in  the  form  of  reinstatement of the  1990  judgments  in  the
  Company's favor against Philips, which were vacated.  This complaint  was
  amended to include Sears, Roebuck and Company ("Sears") as a co-plaintiff
  and  to  seek reinstatement of an unfair competition judgment  only.   In
  December 1995, this second lawsuit was dismissed by the Court.  Izumi and
  Sears filed notices of appeal, but subsequently withdrew the appeal.

  The Company is also subject to other legal proceedings, product liability
  and other claims which arise in the ordinary course of its business.   In
  the  opinion of management, the amount of ultimate liability, if any,  in
  excess of applicable insurance coverage, is not likely to have a material
  effect on the financial position of the Company.  However, as the outcome
  of  litigation or other legal claims is difficult to predict, significant
  changes in the estimated exposures could occur.

  Employment Agreements

  The  Company has entered into employment agreements with several  of  its
  executive  officers  for periods ranging from two  to  five  years.   The
  agreements  provide  the  employees with an  option  to  terminate  their
  agreements and receive lump sum payments of up to five years compensation
  if there is a change in control of the Company.

  Other

  In  April  1994, the Company purchased from Ourimbah Investment,  Limited
  ("Ourimbah")  the  remaining 20% of the issued  and  outstanding  capital
  stock  of Durable (the "Purchased Shares") which had not, prior  to  such
  purchase,  been  owned,  directly  or indirectly,  by  the  Company.   In
  connection  with such purchase, the Company agreed to make an  additional
  payment  to  Ourimbah for the Purchased Shares upon the occurrence  of  a
  change  of  control of the Company on or before July 1, 1999.   Any  such
  additional  payment will be in an amount with respect to  each  Purchased
  Share equal to the greater of (i) the same multiple of earnings per share
  of  Durable  as the highest multiple of earnings per share paid  for  the
  shares  of  common stock of the Company received in connection with  such
  change of control or (ii) the same multiple of net asset value per  share
  of Durable as the highest multiple of price per net asset value per share
  paid for the shares of common stock of the Company received in connection
  with  such  change of control.  For purposes of determining  whether  any
  such  additional payment is required, a change of control will be  deemed
  to have occurred upon (i) the acquisition by any person of 50% or more of
  the then outstanding shares of common stock of the Company, (ii) a change
  in  the  majority of the members of the Company's board of directors  who
  are  serving  as  of  the  date of the purchase agreement  or  (iii)  the
  approval by the Company's shareholders of (A) a reorganization, merger or
  consolidation  in  which the shareholders of the Company  prior  to  such
  transaction  do  not, immediately thereafter, own more than  50%  of  the
  combined  voting power of the Company following such transaction,  (B)  a
  liquidation  of  dissolution of the Company or  (C)  a  sale  of  all  or
  substantially all of the Company's assets.  No change of control will  be
  deemed to have occurred in connection with any transaction approved by  a
  majority of the members of the board of directors.

NOTE K - STOCKHOLDERS' EQUITY

  Warrants

  As  part of a lawsuit settlement, warrants to purchase 750,423 shares  of
  the  Company's  common  stock have been issued.   The  warrants  have  an
  exercise price of $7.50 per share and are exercisable through January 19,
  1998.  At December 31, 1995, 199,189 warrants have been exercised.

  Common Stock Purchase Rights Plan

  In  March  1995,  the Company implemented a Common Stock Purchase  Rights
  Plan  and  distributed one Right for each share of the  Company's  common
  stock outstanding.  The Rights are not exercisable or transferable, apart
  from  the Company's common stock, until after a person or group acquires,
  or  has the right to acquire, beneficial ownership of 15 percent or  more
  of  the  Company's  common  stock (which  threshold  may,  under  certain
  circumstances,  be  reduced  to 10 percent)  or  announces  a  tender  or
  exchange offer to acquire such percentage of the Company's common  stock.
  Each  Right entitles the holder to purchase one quarter of one  share  of
  common  stock at an exercise price of $25.00 per full share and  contains
  provisions that entitle the holder in the event of specific transactions,
  to  purchase  common stock of the Company or any acquiring  or  surviving
  entity  at one-half of market price as determined under the terms of  the
  Rights   Agreement.   The  Rights  will  expire  in  March  2005,  unless
  previously exercised or redeemed at the option of the Company for $.00001
  per Right.

NOTE L - SPECIAL PREFERRED STOCK

  During  1986,  the Company was authorized to issue 40,000,000  shares  of
  $.01 par value special preferred stock purchase rights for each share  of
  common stock, par value $.10 per share.  These rights entitled the holder
  to purchase one share of special preferred stock at a price of $.01 under
  certain conditions in connection with preserving for the Company and  its
  stockholders  the benefits of any recovery in the Company's lawsuit  with
  North  American  Philips Corporation, et al.  In 1992,  these  conditions
  ceased  to  apply, therefore, the special preferred stock  rights  remain
  outstanding but have no continuing application.

  derived  from  sales  to unaffiliated customers.   Included  in  domestic
  revenues  and  operating  profit are certain sales  derived  from  direct
  product  shipments  from Hong Kong to customers  located  in  the  United
  States.

  International operations are conducted in Canada, Hong Kong,  Europe  and
  the People's Republic of China.


NOTE N - CONCENTRATION OF CREDIT AND OTHER RISKS

  The Company sells on credit terms to a majority of its customers, most of
  which are U.S. and Canadian retailers and distributors located throughout
  those countries.

  Wal-Mart  Stores,  Inc.  accounted for 13.1%,  17.8%  and  19.3%  of  the
  Company's sales in 1995, 1994 and 1993, respectively.  In 1995, a kitchen
  electric  appliance  distributor accounted for  11.4%  of  the  Company's
  sales.

  The  Company's  allowance for doubtful accounts is based on  management's
  estimates  of the creditworthiness of its customers, and, in the  opinion
  of management is believed to be set in an amount sufficient to respond to
  normal  business conditions.  Should such conditions deteriorate  or  any
  major  credit  customer default on its obligations to the  Company,  this
  allowance may need to be increased which may have an adverse impact  upon
  the Company's earnings.

  The  Company produces the vast majority of its products in its facilities
  in the People's Republic of China ("PRC").  The Company is subject to the
  risk  that  political  or  economic  upheaval  in  the  PRC  could  cause
  production  disruptions and/or increases to its costs, although  no  such
  events  have  occurred in over five years.  Presently, products  imported
  into  the U.S. from the PRC are subject to favorable duty rates based  on
  the  "Most Favored Nation" status of the PRC ("MFN Status").  MFN  Status
  is  renewed  on  an  annual  basis by the  President  and  Congress.   If
  political or economic instability in the PRC develops or if higher duties
  were  applied  to imports into the U.S., the Company could  experience  a
  material adverse impact on its revenues and earnings.

NOTE O - RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS

  The  Company  has  used  the services of Top Sales  Company,  Inc.  ("Top
  Sales"),  an independent sales representative, since 1978.  A  member  of
  the  Company's  Board  of  Directors is the sole  shareholder  and  Chief
  Executive Officer of Top Sales.  The Company made commission payments  to
  Top  Sales  of  $556,400, $719,600 and $575,500 in 1995, 1994  and  1993,
  respectively.

  In  1986,  the Company made a non-interest bearing loan of $78,000  to  a
  director  of the Company.  The entire amount of such loan was outstanding
  during the current year.

  During 1995, the Company made a series of personal loans bearing interest
  at prevailing market rates to the Company's President and Chief Executive
  Officer.  At December 31, 1995, the loan balance was $680,200.

NOTE P - SUBSEQUENT EVENT

  In  February  1996,  the  Company signed an agreement  with  Salton/Maxim
  Housewares,  Inc.  ("Salton"), whereby it will acquire  a  50%  ownership
  interest  in Salton.  The Company will issue to Salton 748,112 shares  of
  its  common  stock, a $10,847,620 note, and a cash payment of $3,254,286.
  The  closing of the transaction, currently anticipated in June  1996,  is
  subject  to  a  number  of conditions including the  Company  and  Salton
  entering  into mutually satisfactory commercial agreements, the Board  of
  Directors  of  Salton receiving a fairness opinion, and approval  of  the
  transaction by the shareholders of Salton.
