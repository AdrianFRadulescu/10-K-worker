                                   PART I

ITEM 1.                    DESCRIPTION OF BUSINESS

General

Windmere Corporation (the "Company") is engaged principally in
manufacturing and distributing a wide variety of personal care products
and household appliances.  The Company designs and manufactures its
products for sale to retail stores, distributors and professional beauty
supply customers located primarily in the United States, Canada and
Europe, with additional distribution in Latin America and the Far East.
The Company's products are sold largely under its Windmere trade name,
as well as under other trade names, trademarks and private labels.  The
Company also manufactures products on a contract basis for others.  

The Company's products are primarily manufactured by Durable Electrical
Metal Factory, Ltd. ("Durable"), its wholly-owned Hong Kong subsidiary,
in Bao An County, Guandong Province of the People's Republic of China
("People's Republic"), which is approximately 60 miles northwest of
central Hong Kong.  The Company has a significant amount of its assets
in the People's Republic, primarily consisting of inventory, equipment
and molds.  Substantially all of the Company's products are manufactured
by Durable and unrelated factories in the People's Republic. 
Approximately 85% to 90% of the Company's products are manufactured by
Durable.  The supply and cost of these products can be adversely
affected, among other reasons, by changes in foreign currency exchange
rates, increased import duties, imposition of tariffs, imposition of
import quotas, interruptions in sea or air transportation and political
or economic changes.  From time to time, the Company explores
opportunities to diversify its sourcing and/or production of certain
products to other low-cost locations or with other third parties or
joint venture partners in order to reduce its dependence on production
in the People's Republic and/or reduce Durable's dependence on the
Company's existing distribution base.  However, at the present time, the
Company intends to continue its production in the People's Republic.

In June 1989, the People's Republic experienced civil disturbances and,
although such disturbances have dissipated since that time, there
continues to be pressure for political reform.  No assurance can be
given, however, that civil disturbances will not recur.  If it becomes
necessary to relocate the Company's manufacturing facilities from the
People's Republic as a result of civil disturbances in that country or
otherwise, the Company believes the production currently conducted in
the People's Republic could be relocated to other Far East locations,
including Hong Kong, or other low-cost manufacturing locations, with
only temporary disruption and delay in such production and possible
short-term operating and capital losses, provided that the Company is
able to move substantially all of its manufacturing equipment and other
assets currently in the People's Republic to another location.  If the
Company is unable to remove such assets, due to confiscation,
expropriation, nationalization, embargoes or governmental restrictions,
it would incur substantial operating and capital losses, including
losses resulting from business disruption and delays in production.  In
addition, as a result of a relocation of its manufacturing equipment and
certain other assets, the Company would likely incur relatively higher
manufacturing costs.  A relocation could also adversely affect the
Company's revenues if the demand for the Company's products currently
manufactured in the People's Republic decreases due to a disruption in
the production and delivery of such products or due to higher prices
which might result from increased manufacturing costs.  Furthermore,
earnings could be adversely affected due to reduced sales and/or the
Company's inability to maintain its current margins on the products
currently manufactured in the People's Republic.

In May 1994, President Clinton extended the People's Republic's most-
favored-nation (MFN) trading status for an additional year, beginning
July 3, 1994.  In making the decision to renew the People's Republic's
MFN status, the President announced that the United States would, in the
future, permanently de-link MFN renewal from human rights issues, other
than freedom of emigration provisions.  Under U.S. law, MFN status means
that products are subject to the relatively low duty rates set forth in
Column 1 of the Harmonized Tariff Schedules of the United States
(HTSUS), that have resulted from several rounds of reciprocal tariff
negotiations conducted under the auspices of the General Agreement on
Tariffs and Trade (GATT) since 1945.  Products from countries not
eligible for MFN treatment are subject to much higher rates of duty,
averaging 30 percent ad valorem, as set forth in Column 2 of the HTSUS. 
If MFN status for goods produced in the People's Republic were removed,
there would be a substantial increase in tariffs imposed on goods of
Chinese origin entering the United States, including those manufactured
by the Company, which could have a material adverse impact on the
Company's revenues and earnings.

In June 1994, in accordance with the Trade Act of 1974, as amended, the
Office of the United States Trade Representative (USTR) listed the
People's Republic as a "priority foreign country" based on its alleged
failure to provide adequate and effective protection of intellectual
property rights.  On February 4, 1995, the USTR announced that the
United States would take retaliatory trade action against the People's
Republic if the Chinese government did not agree to immediately address
its intellectual property rights concerns.  The USTR also published a
list of products comprising $1.0 billion worth of Chinese exports to the
United States which would be subject to increased duties.  Products
currently manufactured by and for the Company in the People's Republic
were excluded from the USTR's retaliation list.  On February 26, 1995,
the United States and the People's Republic signed an agreement
resolving this dispute, thereby averting the implementation of the
proposed trade sanctions.  

The Company was incorporated under the laws of the State of Florida in
1963.  As used herein, the term "Company" refers to Windmere Corporation
and its subsidiaries, unless the context indicates otherwise.  The
Company's executive offices are located at 5980 Miami Lakes Drive, Miami
Lakes, Florida 33014, (see Item 2. Properties), and its telephone number
is (305) 362-2611.

Products

The major portion of the Company's revenues are generated by the sale of
personal care products.  The Company's personal care products include
hair dryers, curling irons, curling brushes, hairsetters, combs and
brushes, shears, mirrors and electric shavers.  

The Company's appliances include toasters, toaster ovens, can openers,
blenders, hand mixers, waffle irons, steam irons, electronic air
cleaners, fans and air fresheners.

In 1994, 1993 and 1992, net sales of personal care products and
appliances represented approximately 70% and 30%, 74% and 26%, and 67%
and 33%, respectively, of the Company's total net sales.

Marketing and Distribution

Distribution: 

The Company's products are sold principally by independent sales
representatives.  The Company utilizes media advertising, cooperative
advertising and collateral materials to promote its products.  

The Company's products are sold under various federal trademarks and
registrations, some of which include:  Windmere, Jumbo Curl, Belson Pro,
Curlmaster, Design Pro, First Class Gourmet, Solid Gold, Hot 'n Steamy,
Windmere Salon, Steam Express, Air Moves, ESP, Electric Shock
Protection, VIP Pro, Setting Pretty, Skinni Mini, Clothes Shaver, Easy
Styler, Four Way Curls, Set Up, All Curl Trio, Mirror Go Lightly,
Jerdon, First Class, Plak Trac, Plak Pro, Hands Free, Smoke Catcher,
Curly Top, Prelude, High Fashion, Belson, Pro Touch, Pro Star, Hot
Silver, Golden Touch, Profiles, Comare, Salon Designs, Premiere, Espree,
Gold'N-Hot and Gentle Air.  The Company believes that its business has
not been materially dependent on any one such trademark.

The Company's distribution businesses include the sale of consumer
products and professional salon products primarily in the United States,
Canada and Europe.  Consumer products are primarily sold under the
Windmere brand and professional salon products are sold under the Belson
Products and Comare brands.  In addition, private label and controlled
label sales are made by the Company.
  
In the United States, the Company wholesales its line of consumer
products nationwide to retailers, including department stores, drug
chains, catalog stores and discount and variety stores.  The Company
also markets its consumer and professional salon appliances, hair pieces
and a wide variety of brushes and other hair care accessories to
beauticians, barbers and stylists through distributors.  In addition,
certain items, including the Company's hair dryers, curling irons and
other personal care appliances, are sold through professional beauty and
barber retail store outlets.         

The Company owns a 50% interest in a joint venture, Paragon Industries,
which distributes electric fans and other seasonal products manufactured
by Durable and unaffiliated third parties.  At December 31, 1994, this
investment had a negative book value of $.4 million and there were no
significant contingent liabilities arising from such investment.

Manufacturing:

The Company's manufacturing business is conducted by Durable.  Durable,
through its twenty-three year relationship with the Company, has
produced an extensive product line, which includes not only the
appliances sold to the Company and its customers and a substantial
amount of oscillating fans for a joint venture, but it has also become
a contract manufacturer for a range of products, such as toasters,
toaster ovens, can openers, blenders, hand mixers, waffle irons,
electric plug-in fragrance units and contact lens cleaners, which it
sells primarily to customers in the United States, Canada and  Europe. 
Some of its customers are Rival, Reckitt and Colman (Airwick), Salton-
Maxim and Bausch & Lomb.

Manufacturing and Supplies

The Company's foreign sales and operations are subject to the usual
risks incident to operating abroad, including currency fluctuations,
political conditions and changes in foreign laws.  A weakening or
strengthening of the United States dollar may result in higher or lower
cost of goods for the Company from suppliers in countries whose exchange
rate does not parallel the United States dollar, unlike Hong Kong the
currency of which fluctuates substantially parallel to the United States
dollar.

The Company generates approximately 85% to 90% of its revenues from
products manufactured by Durable in the People's Republic.  Such
products utilize raw materials available from at least two and as many
as nine or more independent suppliers.  The Company has no material
dependence on any single foreign source for such materials.

Seasonality

The Company's business is generally seasonal.  The Company has
historically experienced higher revenues in the third and fourth
quarters of each fiscal year primarily due to increased demand by
customers for the Company's products in the late summer for "back to
school" sales and in the fall for Christmas sales.  In typical years,
the Company begins to accumulate inventory for its major selling season
in June and July and it continues to purchase products at accelerated
rates until November.  The Company's major sales occur during August
through November.  Sales are generally made on 60 to 90 day terms. 
Heaviest collections on its open accounts receivable are received from
November through March, at which time the Company is in its most liquid
state.

Backlog

The Company's backlog of orders as of December 31, 1994, 1993 and 1992
was approximately $20.1 million, $17.7 million and $18.4 million,
respectively, which orders are generally shipped within the next
succeeding year.

Competition

The Company encounters significant competition with respect to all of
its products.   Although the Company's prices for products distributed
under its labels are in general below or competitive with those of many
nationally advertised brands, the Company also competes through quality
of product, attractive packaging, breadth of product lines, speed of
delivery and maintenance of good customer relations.  Many of the
Company's major competitors are substantially larger, have greater
financial and other resources and spend more for national advertising. 
Some of the Company's competitors include Conair, Helen of Troy and
Remington.

Regulation

In the United States, Canada and Europe, most federal, state, provincial
and local authorities require Underwriters Laboratory, Inc. ("UL") or
other safety regulation certification prior to marketing electrical
appliances in those jurisdictions.  All of the non-professional salon
appliances marketed by the Company have such certifications.  The
Company endeavors to have most of its products designed to meet those
requirements and to be so certified, although there can be no assurance
that those products, or additional electrical appliances which may be
developed by the Company, will meet such specifications.  Certain of the
products sold by the Company in the United States are subject to the
cosmetic purity and labelling provisions of the Fair Packaging and
Labelling Act.  The Company believes that in addition to  complying with
the Fair Packaging and Labelling Act, it complies with the applicable
rules and regulations of the Federal Trade Commission and other
municipal agencies with respect to, among other things, the content of
advertising and other trade practices.

Patents

Although the Company does not believe that its business is materially
dependent upon patents and patent protection, from time to time, new
products have been introduced with unique features for which the Company
has filed or obtained licenses for patents and design registrations in
the United States and in several foreign countries.

Employees

At March 1, 1995, the Company's distribution businesses in the United
States, Canada, Europe and Hong Kong employed approximately 260 
persons.  Durable's operations in Hong Kong and the People's Republic of
China employed approximately 11,800 persons.  The Company enjoys
satisfactory working relations with these employees.  The Company is not
a party to any collective bargaining agreement.

Geographic Area Financial Information

Incorporated by reference to the Company's 1994 Annual Report to
Shareholders, under the caption, "Note M to Consolidated Financial
Statements, Geographic Area Information".  Included as part of Exhibit
13.

Item 2.  PROPERTIES

The executive offices of the Company, from which a significant amount of
its business activities are conducted, are currently located at 5980
Miami Lakes Drive, Miami Lakes, Florida.  All of the space in this two-
story office and warehouse facility is owned and occupied by the
Company.  The Company also utilizes the services of public warehouses
located in Reno, Nevada and Memphis, Tennessee pursuant to short-term
contracts.

Durable owns approximately 50,000 sq. ft. of office space in Hong Kong,
of which 30,000 sq. ft. is used for its and the Company's trading
companies' headquarters.  Durable also utilizes facilities of 1,800,000
sq. ft. in the People's Republic which it operates under contracts with
the local government.  The contracts require such periodic adjustments
that terms of between one and five years exist at all times.  Certain
facilities have contract terms extending beyond five years. 

ITEM 3.  LEGAL PROCEEDINGS

In 1990, Lasko Metal Products, Inc. ("Lasko") of West Chester,
Pennsylvania, filed a petition with the U.S. Department of Commerce
("Commerce") and the U.S. International Trade Commission alleging that
oscillating fans and ceiling fans from the People's Republic of China
("PRC") are being sold at less than fair value and are causing material
injury to an industry in the United States.  The Company manufactures
oscillating fans in the PRC which are distributed in the United States. 
The Company also has a 50% interest in a joint venture which imports
such fans into the United States.  

In 1991, Commerce announced its final less-than-fair value sales
determination, finding a de minimis dumping margin on oscillating fans
manufactured and imported by the Company.  Based on this result,
Commerce published an antidumping duty order, excluding all oscillating
fans manufactured by the Company from the duties imposed.  


In January 1992, the final determination and antidumping duty order was
appealed to the U.S. Court of International Trade ("Court") by Lasko. 
In December 1992, the Court affirmed Commerce's determination with
respect to all of the challenges raised by Lasko.  Lasko's appeal of the
Court's decision to the Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit was
denied in December 1994.  Lasko has indicated that it does not plan to
appeal further, therefore the matter is closed with no adverse impact on
the Company. 

In April 1994, Kabushiki Kaisha Izumi Seiki Seisakusho, a Japanese
corporation ("Izumi"), filed an action against the Company, David M.
Friedson, the President and Chief Executive Officer of the Company, U.S.
Philips Corporation, North American Philips Corporation and N.V. Philips
Gloellampenfabrieken (together, "Philips").  This action concerns the
1992 settlement (the "Philips Settlement") of certain claims, primarily
a Federal antitrust claim, made by the Company against Philips, which
resulted in an $89,644,257 judgment in favor of the Company.  Pursuant
to the Philips Settlement, Philips paid the Company $57,000,000 in May
1992.  As part of the Philips Settlement, the Company and Philips agreed
that the Company's money judgment against Philips in connection with
such antitrust litigation would be vacated.  Izumi is claiming, among
other things, that the Philips Settlement, including the agreement with
Philips to cooperate to vacate the related judgment in favor of the
Company, constitutes a breach by the Company of a customary
indemnification agreement between Izumi (as seller of goods) and the
Company (as buyer of goods) dated February 20, 1984.  This
indemnification agreement covered certain claims against the Company and
was entered into more than eight months prior to the commencement of the
Philips litigation in connection with the routine purchase by the
Company of goods from Izumi.  Izumi advanced certain legal fees and
costs to the Company in connection with the Philips litigation.  Izumi
is further claiming that it is entitled to recover from the Company an
unspecified portion of the Philips Settlement, punitive damages and
reimbursement of litigation and other related costs and expenses.  The
Company disagrees with Izumi's position and believes that it has
meritorious defenses and counterclaims to these claims by Izumi.  The
Company has filed a pre-answer motion to dismiss Izumi's complaint in
full, decision on which is pending, and it intends to defend this action
fully and vigorously.

The Company is subject to other legal proceedings and claims which arise
in the ordinary course of its business.  In the opinion of management,
the amount of ultimate liability, if any, with respect to these actions
will not materially affect the financial position of the Company.

ITEM 7.   MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND
          RESULTS OF OPERATIONS
           
Year Ended December 31, 1994 compared with Year Ended December 31, 1993

Net Sales

Net sales were $181.1 million and $170.7 million for the years ended
December 31, 1994 and 1993, respectively.  The higher sales volume was
produced by the Company's distribution businesses on increased unit
shipments of core products.  The sales increase was almost evenly divided
between shipments to retailers and professional beauty supply customers.
Manufacturing sales by Durable were relatively unchanged, as 1994's growth
in sales of kitchen electric appliances offset a $6.5 million decline in
sales of electric fragrance units.  Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. accounted for
17.8% of the Company's 1994 sales.

Set forth below is a table indicating the revenues that the Company derived
from its distribution and manufacturing operations for the periods
indicated:
 
                             Year Ended December 31,

                           1994                         1993

Distribution   $155,320,600       86%        $144,609,600         85%
Manufacturing    25,791,600       14           26,051,800         15
  Total Sales  $181,112,200      100%        $170,661,400        100%

Gross Profit Margin

The Company's gross profit margin declined in 1994 to 29.4% of sales from
the 30.3% level in the prior year.  The lower gross margin resulted
primarily from three factors.  The Company experienced the effects of
higher raw materials prices in its third and fourth quarters of 1994.  In
addition, growth in kitchen electric appliance sales was achieved at lower
than normal margins in order to establish a market presence.  Finally,
while manufacturing sales were level for both years, electric fragrance
unit sales, which had higher margins, were significantly lower in 1994. 

Selling, General and Administrative Expenses 

Selling, general and administrative expenses as a percentage of sales were
22.0% and 23.6% in 1994 and 1993, respectively.  The Company's lower
aggregate operating expenses were primarily a result of reduced advertising
costs and legal expenses. 

Unusual or Non-Recurring Items

In 1994, the Company recorded an unusual and non-recurring gain of $7.8
million on the sale of 60,000 square feet of office space in Hong Kong.  No
taxes were provided as the gain is not taxable.

Equity in Net Earnings (Loss) of Joint Ventures

The Company's equity in net earnings (loss) of joint ventures, excluding
the results of a joint venture sold in August 1993, was $.1 million and
$(.3) million in 1994 and 1993, respectively.  Higher sales and gross
margins this year produced the improved earnings.

Taxes

The Company's tax expense is based on the earnings of each of its foreign
and domestic operations and it includes such additional U.S. taxes as are
applicable to the repatriation of foreign earnings.  Offshore earnings
generally are taxed at rates lower than in the United States.  Non-
recurring transactions in 1994 and 1993 lowered the Company's effective tax
rate by 5.9 percentage points in each year.

Earnings Per Share

The average number of common shares and common equivalent shares used in
computing per share results was 8.5% higher in 1994 primarily as a result
of the 1,000,000 shares issued to acquire the additional 20% interest in
Durable, the exercise of stock options and warrants, as well as a higher
dilutive effect from unexercised stock options and warrants due to
increases in the quoted market price of the Company's common stock during
most of 1994.  The purchase and retirement of 397,400 common shares
produced only a small reduction in the annual weighted average shares total
because these purchases occurred late in 1994.

Year Ended December 31, 1993 compared with Year Ended December 31, 1992

Net Sales

Net sales were $170.7 million and $175.5 million for the years ended De-
cember 31, 1993 and 1992, respectively.  The Company's distribution
businesses had a sales increase of $11.8 million primarily resulting from
higher unit shipments of its core products.  Durable's manufacturing sales
were $16.6 million lower primarily due to reduced shipments of electric
fragrance unit and fan products.  Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. accounted for 19.3%
of the Company's 1993 sales.

Set forth below is a table indicating the revenues that the Company derived
from its distribution and manufacturing operations for the periods
indicated:
                                                                            
                               Year Ended December 31,
                                                                            
                        1993                           1992

Distribution   $144,609,600          85%      $132,836,000         76%
Manufacturing    26,051,800          15         42,614,000         24
  Total Sales  $170,661,400         100%      $175,450,000        100%

Gross Profit Margin

The Company's gross profit margin rose in 1993 to 30.3% of sales from the
29.9% level in the prior year.  Durable's manufacturing margins primarily
increased as a result of improved purchasing practices, which led to lower
material costs.  Partially offsetting these increased manufacturing margins
were lower gross margins earned by the Company's distribution businesses in
the generation of their higher sales volume.  

Selling, General and Administrative Expenses

Selling, general and administrative expenses as a percentage of sales were
23.6% in 1993 and 1992.  The Company's aggregate expenses decreased by $1.1
million primarily due to Durable incurring lower shipping and royalty costs
relative to the reduced electric fragrance unit shipments.  

Interest Expense/Interest and Other Income

The Company's interest expense declined by approximately $1.5 million  or
64% primarily due to reduced debt levels.

The Company's interest and other income was $2.2 million and $4.0 million
for 1993 and 1992, respectively.  The 1992 balance includes a $2.2 million
gain from the disposition of Catalina Lighting, Inc. ("Catalina") common
stock.

Equity in Net Earnings (Loss) of Joint Ventures

The Company's equity in net earnings (loss) of joint ventures, excluding
the results of a joint venture sold in August 1993, was $(.3) million and
$(.2) million in 1993 and 1992, respectively. 

Taxes

The Company's tax expense is based on the earnings of each of its foreign
and domestic operations and it includes such additional U.S. taxes as are
applicable to the repatriation of foreign earnings.  Offshore earnings
generally are taxed at rates lower than in the United States.

Cumulative Effect of Accounting Change

The Company adopted Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 109,
"Accounting for Income Taxes", on January 1, 1993, which changed the
Company's method of accounting for income taxes to an asset and liability
approach.  The cumulative effect of this change in the method of accounting
for income taxes, after minority interest in the portion relating to
Durable, was a benefit of $1,731,100 or $.11 per share.  

Earnings Per Share

The average number of common shares and common equivalent shares used in
computing per share results was slightly lower in 1993 primarily as a
result of the purchase and retirement of 858,575 shares from Catalina in
October 1992, which was partially offset by the higher dilutive effect from
unexercised stock options due to increases in the quoted market price of
the Company's common stock and the additional shares issued pursuant to the
exercise of stock options and warrants.
                      
Liquidity & Capital Resources

At December 31, 1994, the Company's working capital was $129.3 million, an
increase of $11.3 million since the end of 1993.  At the end of 1994, 1993
and 1992, the Company's current ratio was 7.0 to 1, 5.8 to 1 and 4.8 to 1,
respectively, and its quick ratio was 3.6 to 1, 3.1 to 1 and 2.3 to 1,
respectively.    

Cash and cash equivalents decreased by $11.8 million during 1994.  Cash of
$.5 million was provided from operating activities, which was net of $14.5
million used in a seasonal buildup of accounts receivable and inventories. 
The Company received $9.5 million from the sale of office space in Hong
Kong in April 1994, and spent approximately $10.4 million during the year
for additions to its fixed assets.  In 1994, the Company purchased and
retired 397,400 shares of its common stock at a cost of $3.9 million.
Quarterly cash dividend payments were resumed in June 1994, and for the
year, $2.5 million was paid to shareholders.

A foreign bank provides a $3.9 million line of credit, payable on demand,
to certain of the Company's foreign subsidiaries (the "subsidiaries"),
secured primarily by the subsidiaries' tangible and intangible property
located in Hong Kong and in the People's Republic of China.  In addition,
should the subsidiaries default in their obligations, the Company has
guaranteed the payment of this debt.  At December 31, 1994, the sub-
sidiaries were utilizing, including letters of credit, approximately $1.5
million of this credit line, leaving an additional funding capacity of $2.4
million.

The Company has a $10.0 million demand line of credit from a domestic bank,
which is secured by domestic accounts receivable.  The Company has had no
borrowings under this facility.

No provision for U.S. taxes has been made on undistributed earnings of the
Company's foreign subsidiaries and joint ventures because management plans
to reinvest such earnings in their respective operations or in other
foreign operations.  Repatriating those earnings or using them in some
other manner which would give rise to a U.S. tax liability would reduce
after tax earnings and available working capital.  

The Company believes that its cash on hand and internally generated funds,
together with its credit lines, will provide sufficient funding to meet the
Company's capital requirements and its operating needs for the foreseeable
future.

Board of Directors and Stockholders
Windmere Corporation

We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Windmere
Corporation and Subsidiaries (the "Company") as of December 31, 1994 and
1993, and the related consolidated statements of earnings, stockholders'
equity and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended
December 31, 1994.  These financial statements are the responsibility of
the Company's management.  Our responsibility is to express an opinion on
these financial statements based on our audits.

We conducted our audits in accordance with generally accepted auditing
standards.  Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to
obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free
of material misstatement.  An audit includes examining, on a test basis,
evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial
statements.  An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles
used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating
the overall financial statement presentation.  We believe that our audits
provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.

In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present fairly,
in all material respects, the consolidated financial position of Windmere
Corporation and Subsidiaries at December 31, 1994 and 1993, and the
consolidated results of their operations and their consolidated cash flows
for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 1994, in
conformity with generally accepted accounting principles.

We have also audited Schedule II of Windmere Corporation and Subsidiaries
for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 1994.  In our
opinion, this schedule presents fairly, in all material respects, the
information required to be set forth therein.

     The parties desire to terminate the Share Option Agreement and

                            ARTICLE I

           REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF HOLDINGS

     Holdings represents and warrants to Windmere as follows:

     1.1  ORGANIZATION AND GOOD STANDING.  Holdings is a
corporation duly organized, validly existing and in good standing
under the laws of Hong Kong.  Holdings also has the corporate power
and authority to carry on its business as and where now conducted,
and has the power to own, operate and lease its properties at and
in the places where such properties are now owned, operated and
leased by it, and is duly qualified to do business in Hong Kong.

     1.2  THE SHARES.  The Class A Shares represent 20% of the
total issued and outstanding shares of capital stock of Durable. 
All of the Class A Shares are fully paid and nonassessable and are
not subject to any  preemptive rights with respect thereto, other
than as set forth in the Share Option Agreement.  Holdings is both
the record and beneficial owner of the Class A Shares.  Holdings
has the full right, power and authority to sell, transfer and
deliver to Windmere the Class A Shares which are to be transferred
to Windmere pursuant to the terms of this Agreement, free and clear
of any liens, claims, charges, debentures, options, pledges, trust
arrangements, restrictions or other encumbrances whatsoever, other
than as set forth in the Share Option Agreement.  There are no
options, warrants or other rights outstanding with respect to or
for the purchase of, nor any outstanding securities convertible
into, any of the Class A Shares, other than as set forth in the
Share Option Agreement.

     1.3  AUTHORITY OF HOLDINGS.  All corporate action necessary to
authorize the negotiation, execution, delivery, recordation and
performance of this Agreement by Holdings has been taken and no
further action by any director, shareholder, shareholder group,
board, committee or by any governmental agency is required to
permit Holdings to comply fully with its obligations under this
Agreement.  The execution of this Agreement and the delivery of the
Class A Shares to Windmere by Holdings is not contrary to the
Memorandum and Articles of Association (howsoever denominated) of
Durable or of Holdings.  Neither the execution, delivery nor
consummation of this Agreement by Holdings will, with the passage
of time, the giving of notice or otherwise, result in a violation
or a breach of, or constitute a default under, any term or
provision of any indenture, mortgage, deed of trust, lease,
instrument, order, judgment, decree, rule, regulation, law,
contract, agreement or any other restriction to which Durable or
Holdings is a party to or by which either of them may be bound, nor
will it result in an acceleration or termination of any loan or
security interest agreement to which Durable or Holdings is a party
or to which any of Durable's and/or Holdings' assets are subject.

     1.4  POWERS OF ATTORNEY OR OTHER AUTHORITY TO ACT FOR
HOLDINGS.

          (a)  Mr. Lai Kin ("Lai") holds a valid power of attorney
duly executed by Holdings in favor of Lai which complies with all
applicable requirements, rules and laws, a copy of which power is
attached hereto as Annex A.  Under such power of attorney, Lai has
the irrevocable right and authority to act on behalf of Holdings
with respect to all matters necessary and convenient to effectuate
this transaction and to deal in any manner with the Class A Shares
and the Windmere Shares (as defined in Section 2.2 hereof) as
provided herein.

          (b)  There is no other power of attorney, representation/
nominee agreement or similar power or agreement given by, or
entered into by, Holdings to any other person with respect to the
handling, possession, sale and other disposition of the Class A
Shares to be transferred to Windmere hereunder.

     1.5  CONSENTS.  No approval or consent of any person, firm,
agency or other entity or body (public and/or private) is required
to be obtained by Holdings for the authorization of this Agreement
and for the execution, delivery and performance of the transactions
contemplated herein except for those approvals or consents which
have been obtained as of the date hereof.

     1.6  ADEQUATE DISCLOSURE.  Holdings is familiar with the
business of Windmere.  Holdings has received Windmere's 1993 Annual
Report to Shareholders, Form 10-K for the year ended December 31,
1993, Proxy Statement for the 1994 Annual Shareholders' Meeting and
Form 10-Q for the quarter ended March 31, 1994 (collectively, the
"Disclosure Documents").  Holdings also has carefully reviewed the
Disclosure Documents and has relied only on the information
contained therein or information otherwise provided to Holdings in
writing by Windmere for purposes of deciding whether to enter into
this Agreement.  Holdings acknowledges that all requested
information relating to this Agreement, Windmere and the Windmere
Shares has been made available for inspection by Holdings and its
financial advisors.  Holdings and its financial advisors have had
a reasonable opportunity to ask questions of and receive answers
from Windmere concerning the terms and conditions of the Windmere
Shares, and to obtain all other additional information necessary or
desirable to verify the accuracy of the information set forth in
the Disclosure Documents.  All such questions have been answered to
the full satisfaction of Holdings.  No oral representations have
been made or oral information furnished to Holdings or its
financial advisors in connection with the transactions contemplated
by this Agreement, including the receipt by Holdings of the
Windmere Shares, which were in any way inconsistent with the
Disclosure Documents.

     1.7  HOLDINGS' FINANCIAL CONDITION.  Holdings (i) has no need
for liquidity for the Windmere Shares, (ii) is able to bear the
economic risks of an investment in the Windmere Shares for an
indefinite period, (iii) can afford a complete loss of such
investment and (iv) does not have an overall commitment to
investments which are not readily marketable that is
disproportionate to its net worth, and its investment in the
Windmere Shares will not cause such commitment to become excessive.

     1.8  NO REGISTRATION OF SECURITIES.  Holdings understands that
the offering and sale of the Windmere Shares has not, as of the
date hereof, been registered under the U.S. Securities Act of 1933
(the "Securities Act") or any other applicable state's securities
laws in reliance upon applicable exemptions from such
registrations.  Holdings understands that the Windmere Shares must
be held by Holdings for an extended period of time unless the sale
or other transfer thereof is subsequently registered under the
Securities Act and any applicable state's securities laws or an
exemption from such registration is available.  Holdings further
understands that, except as provided in Section 5.3 hereof,
Windmere is under no obligation to register the Windmere Shares or
to assist Holdings in complying with any exemption from
registration.

     1.9  INVESTMENT INTENT.  The Windmere Shares are being
received and acquired solely for Holdings' own account for
investment purposes only and not for the account of any other
person and not for distribution, assignment or resale to others.

     1.10 RESTRICTIONS ON TRANSFER.  Holdings understands that it
may not be able to sell or dispose of the Windmere Shares unless
the Windmere Shares are registered under the Securities Act and any
applicable state securities laws, or unless an exemption therefrom
is available to Holdings.  In addition, Holdings understands that
Holdings will be subject to the conditions set forth in Section 4.3
hereof.

     1.11 ACCURACY OF REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES.  All
representations and warranties of Holdings are correct and complete
as of the date set forth in the Agreement, and if there should be
any change in such representations and warranties prior to
Holdings' acquisition of the Windmere Shares, Holdings will
immediately advise Windmere in writing of such change.

or by any governmental agency is required to permit Windmere to
comply fully with its obligations under this Agreement. The
execution of this Agreement by Windmere and the delivery of the
Windmere Shares to Holdings is not contrary to the Articles of
Incorporation and Bylaws of Windmere. Neither the execution,
delivery nor consummation of this Agreement by Windmere will, with
the passage of time, the giving of notice or otherwise, result in
a violation or a breach of, or constitute a default under, any term
or provision of any material indenture, mortgage, deed of trust,
lease, instrument, order judgment, decree, rule, regulation, law,
contract, agreement or any other restriction to which Windmere is
a party or by which it is bound; nor will it result in an
acceleration or termination of any material loan or security
interest agreement to which Windmere is a party or to which its
material assets are subject.

     2.4  CONSENTS.  No approval or consent of any person, firm,
agency or other (public and/or private) entity or body is required

     3.3  ADDITIONAL PAYMENT UPON A CHANGE OF CONTROL OF WINDMERE. 
If at any time from the date hereof through July 1, 1999 there

connection with such Change of Control or (ii) the same multiple of
net asset value per share of Durable as the highest multiple of
price per net asset value per share paid for the shares of common

that any person becoming a director subsequent to the date hereof
whose election, or nomination for election by Windmere's share-

election or nomination of an individual whose initial assumption of
office is in connection with an actual or  threatened election
contest relating to the election of the directors of Windmere, as
such terms are used in Rule 14a-11 of Regulation 14A promulgated
under the Exchange Act)  shall be, for purposes of this Agreement,
considered as though such person were a member of the Incumbent
Board; or

          (iii)     Approval by the shareholders of Windmere of (A)
a reorganization, merger or consolidation with respect to which
persons who were the shareholders of Windmere immediately prior to
such reorganization, merger or consolidation do not, immediately

to vote generally in the election of directors of the reorganized,
merged or consolidated company's then outstanding voting securi-
ties, (B) a liquidation or dissolution of Windmere, or (C) the sale
of all or substantially all of the assets of Windmere, unless the

under this Section 3.3 shall be required, in connection with a
transaction or series of transactions approved by a majority of the
members of the Incumbent Board.

                           ARTICLE IV

                      COVENANTS OF HOLDINGS

     Holdings agrees that:

     4.1  RESTRICTION ON SALE OF WINDMERE SHARES.

          (a)  Holdings acknowledges that the Windmere Shares that
it will receive in connection with this Agreement constitute
"restricted stock" within the meaning of U.S. securities laws
including, without limitation, the Securities Act, and that the
Certificate(s) representing the Windmere Shares will bear an
appropriate legend substantially as follows:

               The Shares represented by this
          certificate have not been registered under the
          Securities Act of 1933 or under any other
          applicable securities laws; consequently,
          these Shares may not be sold, transferred,
          pledged, hypothecated or encumbered in any way
          or disposed of except pursuant to (i) the
          Securities Act of 1933 and the laws of any
          applicable jurisdiction and the rules and
          regulations promulgated thereunder or (ii) an
          opinion of counsel satisfactory to the issuer
          that such registration is not required.

          (b)  Holdings agrees that it will not sell, pledge,
transfer, assign, hypothecate or otherwise dispose of any portion
of the Windmere Shares (or any rights thereto) to any person unless
an exception is available under the Securities Act, any applicable
state's securities laws and the regulations thereunder.

     4.2  DUTY OF CONFIDENTIALITY.  Holdings shall not use,
disclose, confirm, furnish or make accessible to anyone, other than
in the regular course of business of Windmere and its affiliates,
any knowledge or information of a confidential or secret nature
with respect to the business affairs, assets, operations, plans or
know-how of Windmere, Durable or their respective affiliates.

     4.3  HOLDINGS' OBLIGATIONS WITH RESPECT TO THE WINDMERE
SHARES.  Holdings shall be required to furnish to Windmere and its
counsel, all relevant information concerning itself, and such other
information as Windmere and its counsel request to prepare and file
all reports required to be filed by Windmere under the U.S.
Securities laws and the rules and regulations promulgated
thereunder by the United States Securities and Exchange Commission.
If requested by Windmere, such information shall be furnished in
writing and Holdings shall enter into such further agreements or
undertakings with Windmere, including agreements respecting
indemnification with respect to the accuracy and completeness of
such information, as Windmere and its counsel deems necessary or
appropriate to assure full compliance with the applicable
provisions of the U.S. Securities laws and the rules and
regulations promulgated thereunder by the United States Securities
and Exchange Commission.

                            ARTICLE V

                      COVENANTS OF WINDMERE

     Windmere agrees that:

     5.1  REPRESENTATION ON WINDMERE BOARD.  Windmere shall
undertake its best efforts to recommend to the shareholders and
directors of Windmere that Lai and two other individuals nominated
by Lai and deemed suitable by Windmere be appointed as members of
the Windmere Board of Directors.

     5.2  COMPOSITION OF DURABLE BOARD.  It is contemplated that,
immediately subsequent to the transfer of the Class A Shares
provided for in this Agreement, that the day-to-day management of
Durable will remain in the hands of the existing Board of Directors
and managers of Durable (the "Durable Board"), and that the Durable
Board shall initially remain equally divided (50/50) between each
of the present designees of Holdings and those persons selected by
Windmere from time to time for so long as each such designee shall
remain a shareholder of Holdings.  Accordingly, for so long as such
designee of Holdings who is a present member of the Durable Board:
(i) remains a shareholder of Holdings, and (ii) Holdings remains a
shareholder of Windmere, Windmere shall agree to vote its shares of
Durable to appoint such designee of Holdings to the Durable Board. 
At such time as any present designee of Holdings to the Durable
Board ceases to be a shareholder of Holdings, such designee shall
no longer be entitled to serve on the Durable Board, and Windmere
shall have the right to designate a replacement member to the
Durable Board in its sole discretion.  Windmere shall retain the
right to approve the appointment of any other person to the Durable
Board.

     5.3  REGISTRATION OF WINDMERE SHARES UPON CHANGE OF CONTROL. 
Within sixty (60) days following a Change of Control of Windmere
(as defined in Section 3.3), Windmere shall at its expense cause to
be registered under the Securities Act and all applicable state
securities laws such portions of the Windmere Shares that cannot be
sold by Holdings at the end of such sixty (60) day period pursuant
to an exemption from such registrations.  Windmere shall use its
best efforts to cause such registration statement to remain
effective and current until the sale by Holdings of such registered
Windmere Shares.

   FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND REPORT
       OF INDEPENDENT CERTIFIED
          PUBLIC ACCOUNTANTS

         WINDMERE CORPORATION
           AND SUBSIDIARIES

      December 31, 1994 and 1993


                      REPORT OF INDEPENDENT CERTIFIED
                            PUBLIC ACCOUNTANTS


Board of Directors and Stockholders
Windmere Corporation

We  have  audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of  Windmere
Corporation  and Subsidiaries (the "Company") as of December 31,  1994  and
1993,  and  the  related consolidated statements of earnings, stockholders'
equity  and  cash  flows  for  each  of  the  three  years  in  the  period
ended December 31, 1994.  These financial statements are the responsibility
of  the  Company's management.  Our responsibility is to express an opinion
on these financial statements based on our audits.

We  conducted  our  audits in accordance with generally  accepted  auditing
standards.  Those standards require that we plan and perform the  audit  to
obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free
of  material  misstatement.  An audit includes examining, on a test  basis,
evidence   supporting  the  amounts  and  disclosures  in   the   financial
statements.   An  audit  also includes assessing the accounting  principles
used  and  significant estimates made by management, as well as  evaluating
the  overall financial statement presentation.  We believe that our  audits
provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.

In  our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present fairly,
in  all  material respects, the consolidated financial position of Windmere
Corporation  and  Subsidiaries at December  31,  1994  and  1993,  and  the
consolidated results of their operations and their consolidated cash  flows
for  each  of  the three years in the period ended December  31,  1994,  in
conformity with generally accepted accounting principles.

NOTE A - SUMMARY OF ACCOUNTING POLICIES

  Windmere  Corporation  and  Subsidiaries (the "Company")  is  principally
  engaged  in  the  manufacture  and sale of  personal  care  products.   A
  summary  of  the  Company's significant accounting policies  consistently
  applied  in  the  preparation of the accompanying consolidated  financial
  statements follows.

  Principles of Consolidation

  The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company
  and   its   wholly-owned   subsidiaries.    Intercompany   balances   and
  transactions  are eliminated in consolidation.  The Company reflects  its
  investment  in  its 50%-owned joint venture at cost plus  its  equity  in
  undistributed net earnings.

  Foreign Currency Translation

  Balance sheet accounts of the Company's foreign operations are translated
  at  the  exchange  rate in effect at each year end and  income  statement
  accounts  are translated at the average exchange rates prevailing  during
  the  year.   Adjustments  resulting from  this  translation  process  are
  accumulated in a separate component of stockholders' equity and  are  not
  included  in  the  determination of net earnings.  The Company's  foreign
  manufacturing  subsidiary utilizes the local currency as  its  functional
  currency, and the other foreign subsidiaries primarily utilize  the  U.S.
  dollar as their functional currency.

  Cash and Cash Equivalents
  Short-Term Investments

  The  Company  considers all highly liquid investments with maturities  of
  three  months  or  less at the time of purchase to be  cash  equivalents.
  Similar investments with maturities between three months and one year  at
  the time of purchase are classified as short-term investments.

  Inventories

  Inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market; cost is determined
  by  the  first-in,  first-out method.  Inventories are comprised  of  the
  following:

                                                1994         1993

     Raw materials                         $18,993,200   $14,981,700
     Work in process                        15,155,900    14,153,000
     Finished goods                         40,129,300    38,022,800

                                           $74,278,400   $67,157,500

  Receivables from Affiliates

  Receivables  from  affiliates arise primarily in the ordinary  course  of
  business, are both interest and non-interest bearing, and are settled  as
  trade obligations.

  Property, Plant and Equipment

  Depreciation  and amortization are provided for in amounts sufficient  to
  relate  the  cost  of  depreciable assets to  their  estimated  operating
  service lives using accelerated and straight-line methods.

  Intangible Assets

  Intangible assets, consisting primarily of goodwill, are being  amortized
  on  a  straight-line  basis over twenty years.   Intangible  assets  were
  $10,169,300  and $4,960,100 at December 31, 1994 and 1993,  respectively,
  and  the  related accumulated amortization was $1,660,900 and $1,262,100,
  respectively.

  In 1994, the Company acquired the 20% interest in Durable that it did not
  already  own.   The  purchase price consisted  of  the  delivery  of  one
  million  shares of the Company's common stock, valued at $8,000,000,  and
  a  cash  payment  of $10,000.  This acquisition was accounted  for  as  a
  purchase.  Goodwill of $5,211,000 was recognized on the transaction.

  On an ongoing basis, management reviews the valuation and amortization of
  goodwill.   As part of this review, the Company estimates the  value  and
  future  benefits of the net income generated by the related  subsidiaries
  to determine that no impairment has occurred.

  Fair Value of Financial Instruments

  The carrying values of cash and cash equivalents, short-term investments,
  trade receivables and accounts payable approximate fair value due to  the
  short-term maturities of these instruments.

  Income Taxes

  No  provision has been made for U.S. taxes on undistributed  earnings  of
  foreign subsidiaries and joint ventures of approximately $102,300,000  at
  December  31,  1994,  as  it is anticipated that such  earnings  will  be
  reinvested   in   their  respective  operations  or  in   other   foreign
  operations.

  Deferred  taxes have been provided on temporary differences in  reporting
  certain transactions for financial accounting and tax purposes.

  Deferred Income

  In 1992, the Company granted an exclusive license for the distribution of
  a  product. Deferred income of $1,340,600 resulted from this transaction,
  which will be reported as other income on a straight-line basis over  the
  five year license term.

  In 1988, the Company sold its Save-Way Beauty Supply stores for a gain of
  approximately  $6,980,000, $3,300,000 of which was allocated  to  a  ten-
  year  covenant not to compete that is being amortized to other income  on
  a straight-line basis.

  Earnings Per Share

  Earnings  per share are based upon the weighted average number of  common
  shares  and common equivalent shares outstanding during each  year.   The
  total  number  of  such weighted average shares was 17,589,000  in  1994,
  16,212,000  in 1993, and 16,395,000 in 1992.  Stock options and  warrants
  are  considered common stock equivalents unless their inclusion would  be
  antidilutive.


NOTE B - UNUSUAL OR NON-RECURRING ITEMS

  In  1994,  Durable sold 60,000 square feet of office space in Hong  Kong,
  for  $9,500,000.   This transaction generated a non-recurring  profit  of
  $7,810,500,  or approximately $.45 per share.  No taxes were provided  as
  the  gain is not taxable.  Following this sale, Durable continues to  own
  approximately 50,000 square feet of space in Hong Kong, of  which  30,000
  square  feet  is  used  for  its administrative headquarters.   Durable's
  manufacturing  facilities  in the People's Republic  of  China  were  not
  affected by the sale.

  In  1992,  the Company recorded a $4,322,000 loss on the write-off  of  a
  specific contract, due to its non-realizability, under which it  had  the
  right  to  acquire  products and/or services such as  advertising,  which
  contractual rights had been classified primarily as an other asset.   The
  Company sold its rights under this contract for a nominal amount.

  The  Company sold its nail and skincare products subsidiary in 1992 at  a
  loss  of  $1,106,600.  The former subsidiary had an insignificant  impact
  on the Company's revenues and earnings.

NOTE C - INVESTMENTS

  Investments are comprised of the following:

                                                  1994        1993
     Joint venture - at cost plus
       equity in undistributed earnings         $    -      $    -

  The  Company's joint venture investment at each of the above dates had  a
  negative  value  of  approximately $400,000,  which  deficits  have  been
  classified as a reduction in receivables from affiliates.

  The  following table provides financial data for the joint venture, which
  is accounted for on the equity method:

                                                  1994        1993

     Gross profit                            $3,572,500    $2,131,300

     Net earnings (loss)                       $185,000     $(542,400)

  All  sales made by the joint venture were to entities other than  members
  of  the  consolidated group.  Included in the Company's sales  are  sales
  made  to the joint venture of approximately $8,621,000 and $7,866,000  in
  1994 and 1993, respectively.

NOTE E - NOTES AND ACCEPTANCES PAYABLE

  A  foreign bank provides a $3,900,000 line of credit, payable on  demand,
  to  certain  of  the Company's foreign subsidiaries (the "subsidiaries"),
  secured  primarily by the subsidiaries' tangible and intangible  property
  located  in  Hong  Kong  and  in  the People's  Republic  of  China.   In
  addition,  should  the  subsidiaries default in  their  obligations,  the
  Company  has guaranteed the payment of this debt.  At December  31,  1994
  and  1993, the subsidiaries were utilizing, including letters of  credit,
  approximately  $1,500,000 and $3,300,000, respectively,  of  this  credit
  line.

  The Company has a $10,000,000 demand line of credit from a domestic bank,
  which  is secured by domestic accounts receivable.  The Company  has  had
  no borrowings under this facility.

NOTE F - ACCRUED EXPENSES

  In 1985, the Company received proceeds of $7,500,000 from the issuance of
  tax-exempt  industrial development revenue bonds.  The  bonds  are  being
  paid  off  in equal quarterly principal payments of $203,700 through  May
  2000.   At  December 31, 1994, the interest rate on the bonds was  6.70%.
  The  bonds  include certain covenants which provide, among other  things,
  restrictions  relating to the maintenance of minimum  levels  of  working
  capital, net worth and other financial ratios.

NOTE H - EMPLOYEE BENEFIT PLANS

  The  Company  has  a 401(k) plan for its employees to which  the  Company
  makes  discretionary contributions at rates dependent  on  the  level  of
  each  employee's  contributions.  Contributions made by the  Company  are
  limited  to  the maximum allowable for federal income tax purposes.   The
  amounts  charged to earnings for this plan during the three  years  ended
  December 31, 1994 were not significant.

  The Company does not provide any health or other benefits to retirees.

  The  Hong  Kong Inland Revenue Department is auditing the tax returns  of
  most  of the Company's consolidated Hong Kong subsidiaries through  1991,
  and  has  proposed  increases in income taxes  aggregating  approximately
  $5,600,000,  which  proposed amount, or any of  it  which  is  ultimately
  determined  to  be  due,  may  be reduced by U.S.  foreign  tax  credits.
  Inland   Revenue  has  required  that  cash  deposits  of   approximately
  $4,800,000  be  made pending the resolution of the issues, which  amounts
  are  included in prepaid expenses.  The Company has been advised  it  has
  defensible  positions in connection with the issues under discussion  and
  intends  to vigorously contest the proposed tax increases.  The  Internal
  Revenue  Service  is currently examining the Company's 1992  tax  return.
  To   date,  no  material  adjustments  have  been  proposed.   Management
  believes  that adequate provision for taxes has been made for  the  years
  under examination and those not yet examined.

  The  Company adopted Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 109,
  "Accounting  for  Income Taxes", on January 1, 1993,  which  changed  the
  Company's  method  of  accounting  for  income  taxes  to  an  asset  and
  liability  approach.  The cumulative effect of this change in the  method
  of  accounting for income taxes, after minority interest in  the  portion
  relating to Durable, was a benefit of $1,731,100 or $.11 per share.   The
  cumulative  effect  adjustment primarily  consists  of  the  tax  benefit
  associated  with Durable's net operating loss carryforward.  A  valuation
  allowance  has not been recorded due to Durable's current and anticipated
  profitable operations.  A valuation allowance for the entire tax  benefit
  of  the  net  operating  losses accumulated  by  the  Company's  European
  subsidiary  has  been provided as the realizability of  the  benefits  of
  such net operating losses is not assured.

  The primary components of future income tax benefits at December 31, 1994
  are as follows:

     Net operating loss carryforwards
       (net of valuation allowances of $952,500)  $  620,000
     Depreciation and amortization                (1,104,200)
     Deferred income                                 737,700
     Differences in timing between financial
       and tax reporting                           2,100,900
     Other                                           297,400
                                                   2,651,800
     Less amount included in other assets            768,400

                                                  $1,883,400

  The  tax  benefits  resulting from the exercise  of  non-qualified  stock
  options  have  been  recorded as additions  to  paid-in  capital  in  the
  amounts of $328,500 and $257,100 in 1994 and 1993, respectively.

NOTE J - COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES

  Litigation

  In  April  1994,  Kabushiki  Kaisha Izumi Seiki  Seisakusho,  a  Japanese
  corporation  ("Izumi"), filed an action against  the  Company,  David  M.
  Friedson, the President and Chief Executive Officer of the Company,  U.S.
  Philips  Corporation, North American Philips Corporation and N.V. Philips
  Gloellampenfabrieken  (together, "Philips").  This  action  concerns  the
  1992  settlement (the "Philips Settlement") of certain claims,  primarily
  a  Federal  antitrust claim, made by the Company against  Philips,  which
  resulted  in  an $89,644,257 judgment in favor of the Company.   Pursuant
  to  the  Philips Settlement, Philips paid the Company $57,000,000 in  May
  1992.   As part of the Philips Settlement, the Company and Philips agreed
  that  the  Company's  money judgment against Philips in  connection  with
  such  antitrust  litigation would be vacated.  Izumi is  claiming,  among
  other  things, that the Philips Settlement, including the agreement  with
  Philips  to  cooperate to vacate the related judgment  in  favor  of  the
  Company,   constitutes   a  breach  by  the  Company   of   a   customary
  indemnification  agreement between Izumi (as seller  of  goods)  and  the
  Company   (as   buyer   of  goods)  dated  February   20,   1984.    This
  indemnification agreement covered certain claims against the Company  and
  was  entered into more than eight months prior to the commencement of the
  Philips  litigation  in  connection with  the  routine  purchase  by  the
  Company  of  goods  from Izumi.  Izumi advanced certain  legal  fees  and
  costs  to  the Company in connection with the Philips litigation.   Izumi
  is  further  claiming that it is entitled to recover from the Company  an
  unspecified  portion  of  the Philips Settlement,  punitive  damages  and
  reimbursement  of litigation and other related costs and  expenses.   The
  Company  disagrees  with  Izumi's  position  and  believes  that  it  has
  meritorious  defenses and counterclaims to these claims  by  Izumi.   The
  Company  has  filed a pre-answer motion to dismiss Izumi's  complaint  in
  full,  decision on which is pending, and it intends to defend this action
  fully and vigorously.

  The Company is subject to legal proceedings and claims which arise in the
  ordinary  course  of  its business.  In the opinion  of  management,  the
  amount of ultimate liability, if any, with respect to these actions  will
  not materially affect the financial position of the Company.

  Investigations

  In   1990,   Lasko  Metal  Products,  Inc.  ("Lasko")  of  West  Chester,
  Pennsylvania,  filed  a  petition with the U.S.  Department  of  Commerce
  ("Commerce")  and the U.S. International Trade Commission  alleging  that
  oscillating  fans  and ceiling fans from the People's Republic  of  China
  ("PRC")  are being sold at less than fair value and are causing  material
  injury  to  an  industry in the United States.  The Company  manufactures
  oscillating  fans in the PRC which are distributed in the United  States.
  The  Company  also  has a 50% interest in a joint venture  which  imports
  such fans into the United States.

  In   1991,  Commerce  announced  its  final  less-than-fair  value  sales
  determination,  finding a de minimis dumping margin on  oscillating  fans
  manufactured  and  imported  by  the  Company.   Based  on  this  result,
  Commerce  published an antidumping duty order, excluding all  oscillating
  fans manufactured by the Company from the duties imposed.

  In  January 1992, the final determination and antidumping duty order  was
  appealed  to  the U.S. Court of International Trade ("Court")  by  Lasko.
  In  December  1992,  the  Court  affirmed Commerce's  determination  with
  respect to all of the challenges raised by Lasko.  Lasko's appeal of  the
  Court's  decision  to  the Court of Appeals for the Federal  Circuit  was
  denied  in December 1994.  Lasko has indicated that it does not  plan  to
  appeal further, therefore the matter is closed with no adverse impact  on
  the Company.

  Employment Agreements

  The  Company has entered into employment agreements with several  of  its
  executive  officers  for periods ranging from two  to  five  years.   The
  agreements  provide  the  employees with an  option  to  terminate  their
  agreements   and  receive  lump  sum  payments  of  up  to   five   years
  compensation if there is a change in control of the Company.

  Other

  As   of   December  31,  1994,  the  Company  is  committed  to  purchase
  approximately  $14,800,000 of media advertising over the  next  4  years.
  The  commitment  is  to be fulfilled by cash payments of  $6,700,000  and
  usage  of  $8,100,000 of prepaid advertising credits, which  credits  are
  primarily reflected in other assets.

  The  Company's need for television media advertising is primarily related
  to  the  introduction  and  promotion of new  consumer  products  and  to
  support   the  out-of-stock  sales  segment  of  its  consumer   products
  business.   If  these advertising needs are reduced, it  may  impact  the
  ability  of  the  Company to use the balance of the  prepaid  advertising
  credits.   The  Company regularly reviews the extent  to  which  it  will
  advertise its products and utilize the prepaid advertising credits.

  In  April  1994, the Company purchased from Ourimbah Investment,  Limited
  ("Ourimbah")  the  remaining 20% of the issued  and  outstanding  capital
  stock  of Durable (the "Purchased Shares") which had not, prior  to  such
  purchase,  been  owned,  directly  or indirectly,  by  the  Company.   In
  connection  with such purchase, the Company agreed to make an  additional
  payment  to  Ourimbah for the Purchased Shares upon the occurrence  of  a
  change  of  control of the Company on or before July 1, 1999.   Any  such
  additional  payment will be in an amount with respect to  each  Purchased
  Share  equal  to  the greater of (i) the same multiple  of  earnings  per
  share  of Durable as the highest multiple of earnings per share paid  for
  the  shares  of  common stock of the Company received in connection  with
  such  change of control or (ii) the same multiple of net asset value  per
  share  of  Durable as the highest multiple of price per net  asset  value
  per share paid for the shares of common stock of the Company received  in
  connection  with  such  change of control.  For purposes  of  determining
  whether  any  such  additional payment is required, a change  of  control
  will  be  deemed to have occurred upon (i) the acquisition by any  person
  of  50%  or  more of the then outstanding shares of common stock  of  the
  Company,  (ii)  a change in the majority of the members of the  Company's
  board  of  directors  who  are serving as of the  date  of  the  purchase
  agreement or (iii) the approval by the Company's shareholders  of  (A)  a
  reorganization, merger or consolidation in which the shareholders of  the
  Company  prior  to such transaction do not, immediately  thereafter,  own
  more  than 50% of the combined voting power of the Company following such
  transaction,  (B) a liquidation of dissolution of the Company  or  (C)  a
  sale  of all or substantially all of the Company's assets.  No change  of
  control  will  be  deemed  to  have  occurred  in  connection  with   any
  transaction  approved  by  a majority of the  members  of  the  board  of
  directors.

NOTE K - STOCKHOLDERS' EQUITY

  Stock Options

  The  1982  and 1992 Employees' Incentive Stock Option Plans  provide  for
  granting  of  options  of  not  more than 1,200,000  shares  and  500,000
  shares,  respectively, of common stock at a price  based  upon  the  fair
  market value at the date the options are granted.  Options granted  under

  the  Company's  common  stock have been issued.   The  warrants  have  an
  exercise   price   of  $7.50  per  share  and  are  exercisable   through
  January  19,  1998.   At December 31, 1994, 192,722  warrants  have  been
  exercised.

  Common Stock Purchase Rights Plan

  On  March 6, 1995, the Company implemented a Common Stock Purchase Rights
  Plan  and  distributed one Right for each share of the  Company's  common
  stock  outstanding at the close of business on March 1, 1995.  The Rights
  are  not  exercisable  or transferable, apart from the  Company's  common
  stock,  until  after  a person or group acquires, or  has  the  right  to
  acquire,  beneficial  ownership of 15 percent or more  of  the  Company's
  common  stock  (which  threshold  may, under  certain  circumstances,  be
  reduced  to  10  percent)  or announces a tender  or  exchange  offer  to
  acquire  such  percentage  of the Company's  common  stock.   Each  Right
  entitles the holder to purchase one quarter of one share of common  stock
  at  an  exercise  price of $25.00 per full share and contains  provisions
  that  entitle  the  holder  in  the event of  specific  transactions,  to
  purchase  common  stock  of  the Company or any  acquiring  or  surviving
  entity  at one-half of market price as determined under the terms of  the
  Rights  Agreement.   The  Rights will expire on  March  6,  2005,  unless
  previously  exercised  or  redeemed at the  option  of  the  Company  for
  $.00001 per Right.

NOTE L - SPECIAL PREFERRED STOCK

  During  1986,  the Company was authorized to issue 40,000,000  shares  of
  $.01 par value special preferred stock purchase rights for each share  of
  common  stock,  par  value  $.10 per share.  These  rights  entitled  the
  holder  to  purchase one share of special preferred stock at a  price  of
  $.01  under  certain  conditions in connection with  preserving  for  the
  Company  and  its  stockholders  the benefits  of  any  recovery  in  the
  Company's  lawsuit with North American Philips Corporation,  et  al.   In
  1992,  these conditions ceased to apply, therefore, the special preferred
  stock rights remain outstanding but have no continuing application.
