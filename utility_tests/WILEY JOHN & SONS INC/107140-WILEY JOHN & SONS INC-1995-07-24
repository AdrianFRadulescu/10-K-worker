                             PART I
Item 1.   Business

      The  Company is a New York corporation incorporated on
January 15, 1904. (As used herein the term "Company" means John
Wiley & Sons, Inc.,  and  its  subsidiaries and affiliated
companies,  unless  the context indicates otherwise).

      The Company operates in one business segment, namely
publishing, which  develops,  publishes,  and  markets  products
in  print and electronic  formats including textbooks, professional  and
reference works,   consumer   books,  journals,  and  other
subscription-based products,  for  the educational, scientific,
technical,  professional and trade markets in the United States
and internationally.

      Textbooks  are produced primarily for use in formal
instruction in  the  college  and university markets, as well  as
the  secondary school  market in Australia, while professional
and reference  books, encyclopedias,  dictionaries, and
periodicals are intended  primarily for practicing and research
professionals and for libraries.  Some of these, as well as
nonfiction consumer publications, are also marketed to  the
general  public.   In addition,  the  Company  markets  and
distributes  books from other publishers.  The Company also
develops and markets electronic versions of certain of its print
products,  as well  as  computer software and electronic data
bases for educational use  and professional research and
training.  Book publications  are primarily  in  the  areas of
pure and applied  science, engineering, architecture,  the
social  sciences, biomedicine, accounting,  law, computer
science and business administration. Journal  publications are
primarily  in  the  scientific  and technical,  and  biomedical
research areas.

      In fiscal 1995, the Company acquired the publishing
business of Executive  Enterprises,  Inc.,  consisting  of
books,  journals and newsletters for environmental management,
accounting, law  and human resource   professionals;  ValuSource,
which  produces specialized business  valuation  software  for
accountants, entrepreneurs and corporations; the college engineering
list of Houghton  Mifflin; the book publishing program of Oliver
Wight Publications, Inc. consisting of  general management and
manufacturing/quality titles; and the OS/2 computer-book
list of Van Nostrand Reinhold. Early in fiscal  1996, the  Company
entered  into  an agreement in principle  to  acquire Preservation
Press  consisting  of architectural  heritage   books, technical
preservation guides and children's architecture books.

    The  company  is  on the Internet with a World  Wide  Web
site located at http://www.wiley.com.
<PAGE>

Domestic Publishing Operations

    Adopted  textbooks (i.e., textbooks prescribed for course
use) are sold primarily to bookstores serving educational institutions
in the  United  States (i.e., college bookstores).  The Company
employs college   sales   representatives  who  call  upon
faculty members responsible for selecting books to be used in
courses, and upon  the college  bookstores which serve such
institutions and their students. Approximately   3,000  college
bookstores  are active   customers. Textbook sales are generally
made on a fully returnable basis.

     The textbook business is seasonal with the majority of
textbook sales occurring  during  June through August  and  November through
January.   Significant  amounts of inventory are  acquired  prior
to those periods in order to meet customer delivery requirements.
There is  an active used textbook market which negatively affects
the sales of new textbooks.

      Professional and consumer book sales consist of sales to
trade bookstores serving the general public, to wholesalers who
supply such bookstores,  to  certain  college bookstores for
their non-textbook requirements,  to  individual  professional
practitioners,  and   to research   institutions,   jobbers,
libraries   (including   public, professional,  academic,  and
other special  libraries),  industrial organizations, and
governmental agencies.  The Company employs  sales
representatives who  call upon independent  bookstores,  along
with national  and regional chain bookstores, wholesalers and
jobbers  in the  United States.   Trade  sales to  bookstores,
wholesalers  and jobbers are generally made on a fully returnable
basis.

     Sales of professional and consumer books also result from
direct mail  campaigns,  telemarketing,  and  advertising  and
reviews   in periodicals. The mailings and advertising are intended
to  promote sales  through  bookstores and jobbers, as well as to  solicit
sales directly.

      Journal  subscriptions result primarily from  direct  mail
and other advertising  and  promotional campaigns,  renewals  which  are
solicited annually either directly or by companies commonly
referred to  as  independent  subscription  agents,  and
memberships  in  the professional societies for those journals
that are sponsored by  such societies.

      The  Company also receives licensing revenues from
photocopies and electronic reproductions of journal articles and
other materials.

       Domestic   publishing  products,  other  than  journals,
are distributed  from a Company operated warehouse located  in
Somerset, New  Jersey. Journals are mailed to subscribers directly
from  the independent printers.
<PAGE>

International Publishing Operations

   The Company's publications are sold throughout most of the
world through subsidiaries located in Europe, Canada, Australia,
and  Asia, or  through  agents,  or directly from New York.
These subsidiaries market  their  own indigenous publications, as
well as  publications produced  by  the  domestic  operations and
other subsidiaries  and affiliates.

      The  Export Sales Department in New York markets the
Company's publications  through agents as well as foreign sales
representatives in  countries  not served by a foreign
subsidiary. The International Rights Department sells foreign
reprint and translations rights.  The Company publishes, or
licenses others to publish, its products  which are distributed
throughout the world in 40 foreign languages.
  
  Approximately  40% of the Company's fiscal 1995  revenues
were derived from non-U.S. markets.

Publishing Procedures

      The  Company usually enters into agreements with authors
which state  the  terms and conditions under which the respective
authors' materials will be published and under which other
related rights  may be exercised, the name in which the copyright
will be registered, the basis for any royalties, and other
matters.  The Company continues to add  new titles, revise
existing titles, and discontinue the sale  of others in the
normal course of its business.

      Most  of  the authors of the books and other products
published are  compensated  by  royalties which vary with  the
nature  of  the product  and its anticipated sales potential.  In
general,  royalties for  textbooks  and  consumer books are
higher than  royalties  for research  and  reference works.  The
Company makes  advances  against future royalties to authors of
certain of its publications.

      Materials  for publication are obtained from authors
throughout most  of the world through the efforts of an editorial
staff, outside editorial  advisors,  and advisory boards.  Most
materials  originate with  their authors, but many are prepared
as a result of suggestions or  solicitations  by  editors or
advisors. The  Company's  general practice is to revise its basic
textbooks every three to five  years, if
warranted,   and   to  revise  other  titles   as   appropriate.
Approximately  35%  of  the  Company's  fiscal  1995  domestic
book publishing  revenues were from titles published or  revised
in  that fiscal  year.  Subscription-based products, other than
journals,  are updated more frequently on a regular schedule.
<PAGE>

      Most journals are owned by the Company, in which case they
may or may not be sponsored by a professional society.  Some are
owned by such  societies  and  published by the Company  under
an agreement. Societies  which  sponsor or own such journals
generally  receive  a royalty  and/or other consideration which
varies with the  nature  of the  relationship.  The Company
usually enters into  agreements  with the  editors  of journals
which state the duties of the editors,  and the  fees and
expenses for their services.  Contributions of  journal articles
transfer publication rights to the Company or  professional
society,  as  applicable. Journal revenues represented
approximately 29% of the Company's fiscal 1995 revenues.

     The Company's publishing business is not dependent upon a
single customer,  the  loss  of whom could have a material
adverse effect. Approximately 90% of the Company's journal
subscription business  is sourced  through  independent
subscription  agents, and  represents approximately  25% of total
consolidated revenues. These  companies facilitate   the  journal
ordering  process  by consolidating
the subscription   orders/billings  of  each  subscriber.    Monies
are collected in advance from subscribers by the subscription agents
and are  remitted  to  the  journal publishers,  including  the
Company, generally  prior  to  the  commencement of  the
subscription.   Cash receipts  from  subscription agents are
highly  dependent  on  their financial  position and liquidity.
No one agent  accounts  for  more than 6% of total consolidated
revenues.

      The  Company  performs marketing and distribution services
for other  publishers under agency arrangements.  It also engages
in  copublishing  of  titles with foreign publishers and in
publication  of adaptations of works from other publishers for
particular markets.

    Like  most  other  publishers, the Company generally
contracts with independent  printers and binderies for their services.
The Company purchases  its  paper  from printers and from independent
suppliers. Paper prices have increased steadily over the past year.  The
Company believes  that adequate printing and binding facilities,
and  sources of  paper and other required materials are available
to it, and  that it is not dependent upon any single supplier.

     The Company produces electronic versions of some of its
products including  software,  video, CD-ROM, and  through  on-
line services. Approximately 170 products are available in
electronic formats.  The Company  believes  that  the  demand for
new  electronic technology products  will  increase steadily.
Accordingly, to properly  service its  customers and to remain
competitive, the Company anticipates  it will  be  necessary to
increase its expenditures related to such  new technologies over the
next several years.

Copyrights, Patents, Trademarks, and Environment

     Substantially all of the Company's publications are
protected by copyright, either in its own name, in the name of
the author  of the work,  or  in the name of the sponsoring
professional society. Such copyrights protect the Company's
exclusive right to publish the  work in  the  United  States  and
in many countries abroad for  specified periods:  in most cases
the author's life plus 50 years, but  in  any event a minimum of
28 years for works published prior to 1978 and  35 years for
works published thereafter.

     The Company does not own any other material patents,
franchises, or concessions, but does have registered trademarks
and service marks in connection  with  its  publishing  businesses. 
The  Company's operations are generally not affected by environmental
legislation.

Competition Within the Publishing Industry

      The sectors of the publishing industry in which the Company
is engaged  are highly competitive.  The principal competitive
criteria for  the  publishing  industry are believed to  be
product  quality, suitability  of format and subject matter,
author reputation,  price, timely  availability  of both new
titles and revisions  of  existing texts and, for textbooks and
certain trade books, timely delivery  of products  to  retail
outlets.  Recent years have seen a consolidation trend   within
the  publishing industry,  with  several  publishing companies
having  been acquired  by  larger  publishers  and  other
companies.

      Based upon currently available industry statistics, the
Company believes  that of books published and sold in the United
States,  it accounts  for approximately 3% of the total sales of
such  university and  college  textbooks, and approximately 3% of
the total  sales  of such professional books.

   The Company knows of no reliable industry statistics which
would enable  it  to determine its share of the various foreign
markets  in which its operates.  The Company believes that the
percentage of  its total  book publishing sales in markets
outside the United States  is higher  than  that  of  most of the
United States  publishers. The Company  also  believes
it is one of the four largest  publishers of scientific  and 
technical journals worldwide, and  one  of
the two largest  such  domestic  publishers, and  one  of  the
four largest publishers  of  university and college textbooks for
the "hardside" disciplines, i.e. engineering, sciences and
mathematics.

Employees

    As  of April 30, 1995, the Company employed approximately
1,770 persons  on  a full-time basis worldwide, none of whom are
unionized. Management  considers relations with its employees  to
be  generally satisfactory.

            REPORT OF INDEPENDENT PUBLIC ACCOUNTANTS
To the Board of Directors and the Shareholders
of John Wiley & Sons, Inc.:

      We  have  audited the accompanying consolidated  statements
of financial  position  of  John  Wiley  &  Sons,  Inc.  (a   New
York corporation), and subsidiaries as of April 30, 1995 and
1994, and the related  consolidated statements of income and
retained earnings  and cash flows for each of the three years in
the period ended April  30, 1995.   These financial statements
and the schedule referred to below aret the responsibility of the Company's
management.  Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial
statements and the schedule based on our audits.

      We  conducted our audits in accordance with generally
accepted auditing standards.  Those standards require that we
plan and perform the  audit to obtain reasonable assurance about
whether the financial statements  are  free of material
misstatement.   An audit  includes examining,  on  a  test basis,
evidence supporting the  amounts  and disclosures  in  the
financial statements.  An audit  also  includes assessing  the
accounting principles used and significant  estimates made  by
management,  as well as evaluating  the  overall  financial
statement  presentation.   We believe  that  our  audits  provide
a reasonable basis for our opinion.

    In  our  opinion,  the financial statements referred  to
above present  fairly, in all material respects, the financial
position  of John  Wiley & Sons, Inc., and subsidiaries as of
April 30,  1995  and 1994,  and  the results of their operations
and their cash flows  for each  of  the  three  years in the
period ended  April  30,  1995  in conformity with generally
accepted accounting principles.

      Our  audits were made for the purpose of forming an opinion
on the basic financial statements taken as a whole.  The schedule
listed in  the  Index to Consolidated Financial Statements and
Schedules  is presented for purposes of complying with the
Securities and  Exchange Commission's rules and is not part of
the basic financial statements. This  schedule has been subjected
to the auditing procedures  applied in  the audits of the basic
financial statements and, in our opinion, fairly state in all
material respects the financial data required  to be  set  forth
therein in relation to the basic financial  statements taken as a
whole.

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements

Summary of Significant Accounting Policies

Principles of Consolidation: The consolidated financial
statements include the accounts of John Wiley & Sons, Inc., and
its majority owned subsidiaries ("the Company"). All significant
intercompany items have been eliminated.  Certain prior year
amounts have been reclassified to conform to the current year's
presentation.

Sales Returns and Doubtful Accounts: The Company provides an
estimated allowance for doubtful accounts and for future returns
on sales made during the year. The allowance for doubtful
accounts and returns (estimated returns net of inventory and
royalty costs) is shown as a reduction of receivables in the
accompanying consolidated balance sheets and amounted to $22.6
and $19.9 million at April 30, 1995 and 1994, respectively.

Depreciation and Amortization: Furniture and equipment is
depreciated principally on the straight-line method over
estimated useful lives ranging from 3 to 10 years. Leasehold
improvements and capital leases are amortized over the lesser of
the estimated useful lives of the assets or the duration of the
various leases, using the straight-line method.  Composition
costs representing the costs incurred to bring an edited
manuscript to publication including typesetting, proofreading,
design and illustration, etc. are capitalized and amortized over
estimated useful lives representative of product revenue
patterns, generally 3 years.

Intangible Assets: Intangible assets consist of: acquired
publication rights, which are principally amortized based on the
projected revenues of titles acquired; non-compete agreements,
which are amortized over the term of such agreements; and
goodwill and other intangibles, which are amortized on a straight-
line basis over periods ranging from 10 to 40 years.  If facts
and circumstances indicate that intangible assets may be
permanently impaired, it is the Company's policy to assess the
carrying value and recoverability of such assets based on an
analysis of undiscounted future cash flows of the related operations.  Any
resulting reduction in carrying value would be charged to
operating results.

Income Per Share: Income per share is determined by dividing
income by the weighted average number of common shares
outstanding and common stock equivalents resulting from the
assumed exercise of outstanding dilutive stock options and other
stock awards less shares assumed to be repurchased with the
related proceeds at the average market price for the period for
primary earnings per share, and at the higher of the average or
end of period market price for fully diluted earnings per share.

Subscription Revenues: Subscription revenues are generally
collected in advance. These revenues are deferred and recognized
as earned when the related issue is shipped to the subscriber.

<PAGE>

Foreign Exchange Contracts: The Company, from time to time,
enters into forward exchange contracts as a hedge against its
overseas subsidiaries' non-functional currency asset, liability,
and commitment exposures. Such exposures include anticipated
annual journal subscription revenues, as well as that portion of
the revenues and related receivables on sales of book products,
that are denominated in U.S. dollars, while the foreign
subsidiaries' expense structure is denominated in their own
functional currencies. Realized and unrealized gains and losses
are deferred and taken into income over the lives of the hedged
items if permitted by generally accepted accounting principles;
otherwise the contracts are marked to market with any gains and
losses reflected in operating expenses. There were no open foreign
exchange contracts, and no gains or losses were deferred at
April 30, 1995 or 1994.

Cash Equivalents: Cash equivalents consist primarily of highly
liquid investments with a maturity of three months or less and
are stated at cost plus accrued interest which approximates
market value.

Adoption of New Accounting Standards: The Company adopted the
following Statements of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS)
effective as of the beginning of fiscal 1994:

- -    Employer's Accounting for Postretirement Benefits Other Than
     Pensions - SFAS No. 106
- -    Accounting for Income Taxes - SFAS No. 109
- -    Employer's Accounting for Postemployment Benefits - SFAS No.
     112

     The Postretirement Benefits standard changed the method of
accounting for retiree life insurance and health care benefits
from the current practice of expensing the cost of such benefits
on a pay as-you-go, cash basis to expensing the cost over the
years the employees render service.  The cumulative effect of
adopting this standard amounted to a charge of approximately $.2
million, or $.1 million after taxes, in fiscal 1994.

     The Income Tax standard changed the method of accounting for
income taxes from the deferred method to the liability method,
under which deferred tax assets and liabilities are now measured
based on the enacted tax rates and laws that will be in effect
when the deferred tax items are expected to reverse.  The change
had the effect of increasing net deferred tax benefits, resulting
in a cumulative effect of approximately $1.3 million of income in
fiscal 1994.

   The Postemployment Benefit standard requires the accrual of
costs related to health care benefits provided to former or
inactive employees prior to retirement.  The cumulative effect of
adopting this standard amounted to a charge of approximately $1.6
million, or $1.1 million after taxes, in fiscal 1994.

     The net cumulative effect of adopting these new standards as
of the beginning of fiscal 1994 was not material.  Prior period
financial statements have not been restated.

Acquisitions

In fiscal 1995, the Company acquired the publishing business of
Executive Enterprises, Inc., consisting of books, journals and
newsletters for environmental management, accounting, law and
human resource professionals; ValuSource, which produces
specialized business valuation software for accountants,
entrepreneurs and corporations; the college engineering list of
Houghton Mifflin; the book publishing program of Oliver Wight
Publications, Inc., consisting of general management and
manufacturing/quality titles; the OS/2 computer-book list of Van
Nostrand Reinhold, Inc., and other smaller publishing lists, for
purchase prices aggregating $12.3 million in cash plus assumed
liabilities of $2.9 million. The excess of cost over the fair
value of the tangible assets acquired amounted to approximately
$13.5 million, of which $6.7 million related to acquired
publication rights, $.5 million related to non-compete
agreements, and $6.3 million represented goodwill and other
intangibles which are being amortized over 10 to 15 years.

 In fiscal 1994, the Company acquired the professional computer
book line of QED Information Services in the United States;
Belhaven Press, which publishes earth and environmental science
titles in the United Kingdom; and the Company's joint venture
partner's 30% minority interest in Protocols, which publishes
life science continuity products, for purchase prices aggregating
$8.3 million. The excess of cost over the fair value of the
tangible assets acquired amounted to approximately $6.9 million,
of which $.5 million related to acquired publication rights, $.3
million related to noncompete agreements, and $6.1 million
represented goodwill and other intangibles which are being
amortized over 15 years.
   
    These acquisitions have been accounted for by the purchase
method, and the accompanying financial statements include their
results of operations since their respective dates of
acquisition. The pro forma effects on the results of operations
for these acquisitions were not material.

Divested and Restructured Operations

  In fiscal 1994, the Company divested its Canadian high school
and Australian primary school and certain agency lines for
aggregate proceeds of $9.2 million, resulting in a gain of $1.8
million, or $1.3 million after taxes.  In addition, in a cost
saving initiative, the Company restructured and consolidated
certain distribution and information technology support functions
which resulted in an unusual charge of $1.8 million, or $1.1
million after taxes.  The net effect of the divestitures and
restructurings amounted to an after-tax gain of $.2 million, or
$.03 per share, in fiscal 1994.

     The Company has filed amended U.S. federal income tax
returns for prior years primarily related to timing differences
and resulting in potential refund claims, which are subject to
Internal Revenue Service approval.

     In general, the Company plans to continue to invest the
undistributed earnings of its foreign subsidiaries in those
businesses and therefore, no provision is made for taxes which
would be payable if such earnings were distributed. At April 30,
1995, the undistributed earnings of foreign subsidiaries
approximated $22.4 million and, if remitted currently, would
result in additional taxes approximating $1.5 million.

Notes Payable and Debt

Long-term debt consisted of the following at April 30:

Dollars in thousands          1995        1994
10.31% unsecured notes due
 Through July 1998           $  _    $   32,000
Less current maturities        _         (6,000)
Long-term debt              $  _     $   26,000

     In fiscal 1995, the Company prepaid the remaining $26
million of the 10.31% notes outstanding.  Although the Company
incurred prepayment costs of $1.6 million, which is included in
interest income and other, the Company benefits by eliminating
the negative interest rate spread between the higher interest
rate on the debt retired compared with the current interest rates
being earned on short-term investments.  Also included in
interest income and other is a gain of $1.5 million related to
the sale of shares of Nippon Wilson Learning which were received
in connection with the sale of the Company's training business in
fiscal 1991.
<PAGE>
   The Company has a new revolving credit agreement with three
banks providing a line of credit of $50 million until March 30,
2000. The Company has the option of borrowing Eurodollars at a
rate based on the London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR) or
dollars at the banks' prime rate or at a rate based on the
current certificate of deposit rate. A facility fee ranging from
 .125% to .25% depending on certain coverage ratios is charged on
the total commitment.  In the event of a change of control,
as defined, the banks have the option to terminate the agreement
and require repayment of any amounts outstanding. The Company and
its subsidiaries also have other short term lines of credit
aggregating $51 million at various interest rates. Information
relating to short-term lines of credit follows:

  Weighted average interest rate     8.7%      7.0%      9.6%
  
    The Company's revolving credit agreement contains certain
restrictive covenants related to minimum net worth, funded debt
levels, financial ratios, restricted payments, including a
cumulative limitation for dividends paid. Under the most
restrictive covenant, approximately $36 million was available for
the payment of future dividends.

Retirement Plans

     The Company and its principal subsidiaries have contributory
and noncontributory retirement plans which cover substantially
all employees. The plans generally provide for employee
retirement between the ages of 60 to 65 and benefits based on
length of service and final average compensation, as defined. In
fiscal 1995, the domestic plan was amended to provide that final
average compensation be based on the highest three consecutive
years ended December 31, 1993.  The Company may, but is not
required to, update from time to time the ending date for the
three-year period used to determine final average compensation.
The amendment had the effect of increasing pension expense for
fiscal 1995 by approximately $.2 million. Funds are contributed
as necessary to provide for current service and for a portion of
any unfunded projected benefit obligation. To the extent these
requirements are exceeded by plan assets, a contribution may not
be made in a particular year. Plan assets consist principally of
investments in corporate stocks and bonds and government
obligations. 

Pension costs for the defined benefit plans were as follows:

Dollars in thousands             1995      1994       1993
Service Cost                  $ 2,418   $ 2,095   $  2,008

Net Periodic Pension Expense  $ 1,157     $ 752      $ 602

<PAGE>

   The net pension expense included above for the international
plans amounted to approximately $1.0 million for 1995, 1994, and
1993, respectively.

 The following table sets forth the status of the plans and the
amounts recognized in the Company's consolidated statements of
financial position.

    The Company has agreements with certain officers and senior
management personnel that provide for the payment of
supplemental retirement benefits during each of the 10 years after the
termination of employment. Under certain circumstances, including
a change of control as defined, the payment of such amounts could
be accelerated on a present value basis. The cost of these
benefits is being charged to expense on a present value basis
over the estimated term of employment and amounted to
approximately $.9, $.7 and $.7 million in 1995, 1994 and 1993,
respectively.

     The Company provides life insurance and health care
benefits, subject to certain dollar limitations and retiree
contributions, for substantially all of its retired domestic
employees. The cost of such benefits is expensed over the years
that the employees render service and are funded on a pay-as-you-
go, cash basis.  The accumulated postretirement benefit
obligation amounted to $.2 million at April 30, 1995 and 1994 and
the amount expensed in fiscal 1995 and prior years was not
material.

leases are $14.4, $14.2, $13.2, $12.9 and $12.7 million for
fiscal years 1996 through 2000, respectively. The Company is
guarantor through 1998 of certain lease obligations assumed by
the buyer of the domestic training operations which were divested
in fiscal 1991, aggregating approximately $4.2 million, which is
net of the 50% guarantee provided by the parent of the buyer.

    The Company is involved in routine litigation in the ordinary
course of its business. In the opinion of management, the
ultimate resolution of all pending litigation will not have a
material effect upon the financial condition or results of
operations of the Company.

Stock Option and Other Plans

     Options were granted on the Company's Class A Common stock
and are exercisable, in part or in full, over a maximum period of
10 years from the date of grant under various stock option plans.
Outstanding options were granted at prices not less than 100% of
the fair market value of the stock at the date the options were
granted. Under certain circumstances relating to a change of
control, as defined, the right to exercise options outstanding
could be accelerated.

      Option activity under existing plans was as follows:

     Under the terms of the Company's executive long-term
incentive plans, upon the achievement of certain three-year
financial performance based targets, awards will be payable in
cash and/or restricted shares of the Company's Class A Common
stock based on the market value at the end of the plan cycle. The
restricted shares vest equally as to 50% on the first and second
anniversary date after the date of the award. The amount charged
to expense for such plans was approximately $.8, $.7 and $.8
million in 1995, 1994 and 1993, respectively.  Restricted shares
issued under the plans amounted to 5,542, 16,820 and 10,966 in
1995, 1994 and 1993, respectively.
<PAGE>
    
    In fiscal 1995, the Company granted a total of 45,000
restricted shares of the Company's Class A Common stock to four
key executive officers in connection with their employment
agreements. The restricted shares vest one-third at the end of
the third, fourth and fifth years, respectively, following the
date of the grant.  Under certain circumstances relating to a change
of control or termination, as defined, the restrictions would lapse
and shares would vest earlier.  Compensation expense aggregating $1.9
million will be charged to earnings ratably over five years, or
sooner if vesting is accelerated, from the date of grant, and
amounted to $.3 million in fiscal 1995.  A second grant of an
additional 45,000 restricted shares with similar terms and
conditions was made subsequent to the fiscal 1995 year-end.

    Under the terms of the Company's Director Stock Plan, each
member of the Board of Directors who is not an employee of the
Company is awarded Class A Common stock equal to 50% of the board
member's cash compensation, based on the market value of the
stock on the date of the shareholders' meeting. The compensation
cost related to this plan and charged to expense amounted to
approximately $.2, $.2 and $.1 million in 1995, 1994 and 1993,
respectively. Under this plan 4,331, 6,846 and 4,068 shares were
issued in 1995, 1994 and 1993, respectively.

Results of Operations:
Fiscal 1995 Compared to Fiscal 1994

   In 1995, the Company continued to grow its core businesses
through a combination of internal development and acquisitions,
while at the same time improving its profitability and return on
investment.

     The Company invested $12.3 million during the year to
acquire: the publishing business of Executive Enterprises, Inc.,
consisting of books, journals and newsletters for environmental
management, accounting, law and human resource professionals;
ValuSource, which produces specialized business valuation
software for accountants, entrepreneurs and corporations; the
college engineering list of Houghton Mifflin; the book publishing
program of Oliver Wight Publications, Inc., consisting of general
management and manufacturing/quality titles; and the OS/2
computer-book list of Van Nostrand Reinhold, Inc.

   Revenues for the year advanced 13% to $331.1 million led by
the domestic professional and trade division, where revenues
increased 20% based on the strength of the business and computer
book lines. The domestic scientific, technical and medical
division registered a 10% improvement attributable to increased
journal revenues.  The domestic college division increased its
market share and outperformed the industry as a whole in what was
considered a difficult market environment.  International
revenues reflected significant increases over the prior year led
by the Company's European and Asian operations.

<PAGE>

   Cost of sales as a percentage of revenues was 34.2% in 1995
compared with 33.9% in the prior year primarily reflecting
increased paper costs.

    Operating and administrative expenses as a percentage of
revenues declined to 56.5% in 1995 from 57.8% as the rate of
growth in expenses was contained at less than the revenue growth
rate. This improvement was offset to some degree by unfavorable
foreign exchange rates.

    Operating income increased 43% over the prior year to $26.9
million primarily due to the effects of the higher revenue base
coupled with a cost contained infrastructure.

    Interest expense declined by $.8 million due to the
repayment of long-term debt.  The effective tax rate was 29% in
both years due to the benefits derived from lower taxed foreign
source earnings.

    Net income increased 51% over 1994 due to the operating income
gains and lower interest expense.

Results of Operations:
Fiscal 1994 Compared to Fiscal 1993

     The Company acquired several publishing businesses during the
year, for purchase prices aggregating $8.3 million including: the
professional computer book line of QED Information Services; the
Belhaven Press, which publishes earth and environmental science
titles in the United Kingdom; and the Protocols joint venture
partner's 30% minority interest, thereby giving the Company total
ownership of this publisher of life science continuity products.

     During fiscal 1994, the Company divested its Canadian high
school and Australian primary school and certain agency lines for
$9.2 million in aggregate proceeds, which resulted in a net gain
after taxes of $1.3 million.  In addition, in a cost-saving
initiative, certain distribution and information technology
support functions were restructured and consolidated, resulting
in an after tax charge of $1.1 million.  The net effect of the
above amounted to an after-tax gain of $.2 million, or $.03 per
share.

     Revenues of $294.3 million for 1994 increased 8% over the
prior year.  The domestic college division achieved revenue
growth of 13% over the prior year by increasing market share
through the publication of new and revised editions in its key
disciplines, as well as through sales of a stronger backlist.
The domestic professional and trade division registered a 13%
increase paced by increased sales and marketing efforts both here
and abroad, expansion of its continuity product base in
accounting and architecture books, acquisition of a computer book
line, and the publication of tax guides resulting from the new
tax law, as well as new business and investment books.  The domestic
scientific, technical and medical division posted an 8% increase in revenues
attributable to higher journal revenues.  Revenue improvement was
also noteworthy in our Asian operations due to expanded marketing
efforts in that region, and in the United Kingdom due to higher
journal revenues.

     Cost of sales as a percentage of revenues was 33.9% in 1994,
approximately the same as the prior year.

     Operating and administrative expenses as a percentage of
revenues declined to 57.8% in 1994 from 59.5% due mainly to cost
containment measures as well as favorable foreign exchange
effects.

     Operating income of $18.9 million was approximately 45%
higher than the prior year, as the revenue growth mentioned above
more than compensated for the planned increases in the expense
structure.
<PAGE>

     Interest expense declined $.4 million due to repayments on
long term debt. Interest income increased by $.3 million from the
prior year due to higher cash balances, offset to some degree by
lower rates.

     The effective tax rate was 29% in 1994, compared with 27% in
1993.  The increase is primarily due to higher domestic tax rates
and a lower proportion of foreign source income in 1994, which is
taxed at rates lower than the U.S. federal statutory rate.

     Net income increased 57% over the prior year, as operating
income gains and increases in net interest income more than
offset a slightly higher effective tax rate.

     Effective as of the beginning of fiscal 1994, the Company,
adopted SFAS No. 106 - Employer's Accounting for Postretirement
Benefits Other Than Pensions, SFAS No. 109 - Accounting for
Income Taxes and SFAS No. 112 - Employer's Accounting for
Postemployment Benefits.  The net cumulative effect of adopting
these new standards and the ongoing effect on fiscal 1994 results
of operations was not material.

Liquidity and Capital Resources

     The Company's cash and cash equivalents balance was $34.4
million at the end of fiscal 1995, compared with $57.5 at the end
of the prior year.  The decrease is primarily attributable to the
prepayment of the outstanding balance of long-term debt, which
benefits the Company by eliminating the negative interest rate
spread between the higher interest rate on the debt retired
compared with the current interest rates being earned on short-
term investments. Cash provided by operating activities was $51.9
million in fiscal 1995, an increase of $12.2 million over the
prior year.

    The Company's operating cash flow is strongly affected by the
seasonality of its domestic college business and receipts from
its journal subscriptions.  Receipts from journal subscriptions
occur primarily during November and December from companies
commonly referred to as independent subscription agents.  These
companies facilitate the journal ordering process by
consolidating the subscription orders/billings of each
subscriber.  Monies are collected in advance from subscribers by
the subscription agents and are remitted to the journal
publishers, including the Company, generally prior to the
commencement of the subscription. Remittances are highly
dependent upon the financial position and liquidity of such
companies.

    Sales to the domestic college market tend to be concentrated in
June through August, and again in November through January.  Cash
disbursements for inventory are relatively large during the
spring in anticipation of these college sales.  The Company
normally requires increased funds for working capital from the
beginning of the fiscal year into September.  Subject to
variations that may be caused by fluctuations in inventory
accumulation or in patterns of customer payments, the Company's
normal operating cash flow is not expected to vary materially in
the near term.

     To finance its short-term seasonal working capital requirements
and its growth opportunities, the Company has adequate cash and
cash equivalents available, as well as both domestic and foreign
shortterm lines of credit, as more fully described in the note to
the consolidated financial statements entitled "Notes Payable and
Debt".
<PAGE>

     The capital expenditures of the Company consist primarily of
investments in product development and property and equipment.
Capital expenditures for fiscal 1996 are expected to increase
approximately 25% over 1995, primarily representing increased
investments in product development, including electronic media
products, and computer equipment upgrades to support the higher
volume of business to ensure efficient quality-driven customer
service. These investments will be funded primarily from internal
cash generation or from the liquidation of cash equivalents.


Effects of Inflation and Cost Increases

     Although the impact of inflation is somewhat minimized, as
the business does not require a high level of investment in
property and equipment, the Company does experience continuing
cost increases reflecting, in part, general inflationary factors.
Fiscal 1995 witnessed an increase in paper prices ranging from
10% to 100% depending on the grade, after years of a stable to
decreasing price environment.  Although results for fiscal 1995
were slightly affected, it is anticipated that these increases
will have a greater impact on fiscal 1996 results.  To mitigate
the effects of paper and other cost increases, the Company has
taken a number of initiatives including various steps to lower
overall production and manufacturing costs including substitution
of paper grades.  In addition, selling prices have been
selectively increased as competitive conditions permit.  The
Company anticipates that it will be able to continue this
approach in the future.

                           By-Laws
                    As Amended July 1994
                   John Wiley & Sons, Inc.
                          Article I
Offices
 Section 1. Offices. The principle office of the Corporation
shall  be  in  the City, County and State of New  York.  The
Corporation may also have offices and places of business  at
such other places within or without the State of New York as
the  Board  of Directors may from time to time determine  or
the business of the Corporation may require.

                         Article II
Shareholders

  Section  1.  Annual  Meeting. The annual  meeting  of  the
shareholders of the Corporation shall be held on  the  third
Thursday  of September, in each year or, if a legal holiday,
on  the  next  business  day, or (whether  or  not  a  legal
holiday)  on such other day in September as may be fixed  by
resolution of the Board of Directors or by the chairman,  at
which the shareholders shall elect a Board of Directors  and
transact such other business as may properly come before the
meeting.

  Section  2.  Special  Meeting.  Special  meetings  of  the
shareholders  for any purpose or purposes, unless  otherwise
prescribed  by statute, may be called by resolution  of  the
Board  of Directors or by the chairman, and shall be  called
by  the  chairman  or by the president  at  the  request  in
writing  of  a  majority  of the Board  of  Directors.  Such
request shall state the purpose of the proposed meeting.

  Section  3.  Time and Place of Meeting.  Meetings  of  the
shareholders shall be held at such time and place within  or
without the State of New York as the Board of Directors  may
determine,  or  as  shall be stated in the  notices  of  the
meeting.

  Section  4.  Notice of Meeting. Written  notice  of  every
meeting of shareholders, stating the purpose or purposes for
which the meeting is called and the place, date and hour  of
the  meeting, and unless the notice pertains to  the  annual
meeting,  indicating that it is being issued by  or  at  the
direction  of  the  persons calling the  meeting,  shall  be
given, personally or by mail, no less than ten nor more than
fifty  days  before  the  date  of  the  meeting,  to   each
shareholder  entitled to vote at such  meeting.  If  mailed,
such  notice  shall  be directed to the shareholder  at  the
shareholder's  address as it appears  on  the  Corporation's
record  of shareholders, unless such shareholder shall  have
filed  with  the  Secretary  of the  Corporation  a  written
request  that  notices be mailed to some other  address,  in
which  event the notice shall be directed to the shareholder
at  such other address. Notice of meeting need not be  given
to any shareholder who submits a waiver of notice, signed in
person or by proxy, whether before or after the meeting. The
attendance of any shareholder at a meeting, in person or  by
proxy,  without protest as to the sufficiency of  notice  of
such meeting, shall constitute  a waiver by such shareholder
of such notice.

  Section  5.  Quorum.  Except as  otherwise  prescribed  by
statute,  the  holders of a majority of the shares  of  each
class  issued and outstanding and entitled to vote  thereat,
present  in  person  or  represented  by  proxy,  shall   be
requisite  to and shall constitute a quorum at all  meetings
of  the  shareholders for the transaction of  each  item  of
business  required  to be voted on by a class  voting  as  a
class.  Except as otherwise provided by statute, the holders
of  shares  issued  and  outstanding and  entitled  to  vote
thereat  of  a majority of the votes accorded to holders  of
all shares, present in person or represented by proxy, shall
be  requisite  to  and  shall constitute  a  quorum  at  all
meetings  of  the shareholders for the transactions  of  any
items of business not required to be voted on separately  by
a  class.   If a quorum shall not be present or represented,
the shareholders entitled to vote thereat, present in person
or  represented  by proxy, shall have power to  adjourn  the
                          -1-
<PAGE>

meeting  from  time  to  time,  without  notice  other  than
announcement at the meeting, until a quorum shall be present
and  represented.   At such adjourned meetings  at  which  a
quorum shall be present or represented, any business may  be
transacted  which might have been transacted at the  meeting
as originally noticed.

  Section  6.  Voting.  Except as  otherwise  prescribed  by
statute,  each  shareholder of record having  the  right  to
vote,  in  respect of each share of stock standing  in  that
shareholder's name on the books of the Corporation, shall be
entitled  at  every  meeting  of  the  shareholders  of  the
Corporation  to such voting rights as are specified  in  the
Certificate of Incorporation of the Corporation. Such voting
rights may be exercised in person or by proxy. All elections
shall  be  determined by a plurality of the class of  shares
voting  thereon,  and,  except as  otherwise  prescribed  by
statute,  all other matters shall be determined by  vote  of
the  majority  of  votes  cast by  shareholders  present  or
represented at such meeting and voting on such question.

 Section 7. Introduction of Business at an Annual Meeting of
Shareholders. Except as otherwise provided by  law,  at  any
meeting   of  shareholders  only  such  business  shall   be
conducted  as  shall have been properly brought  before  the
meeting. In order to be properly brought before the meeting,
such  business  must have either been (a) specified  in  the
written  notice  of the meeting (or any supplement  thereto)
given to shareholders of record on the record date for  such
meeting  by  or at the direction of the Board of  Directors,
(b) brought before the meeting at the direction of the Board
of Directors or the presiding officer of the meeting, or (c)
specified  in a written notice given by or on  behalf  of  a
shareholder  of record on the record date for  such  meeting
entitled to vote thereat or a duly authorized proxy for such
shareholder, provided that such shareholder continues to  be
a  shareholder  of  record at the time of  such  meeting  in
accordance with all of the following requirements. A  notice
referred   to  in  clause  (c)  hereof  must  be   delivered
personally,  or  mailed to and received  at,  the  principal
executive  office  of  the  Corporation,  addressed  to  the
attention of the secretary, not less than 120 calendar  days
in   advance   of  the  date  in  the  then   current   year
corresponding to the date the Corporation's proxy  statement
was released to shareholders in connection with the previous
year's  annual meeting of shareholders, except that  if  the
date of the annual meeting has been changed by more than  30
calendar days from any date contemplated at the time of  the
previous year's proxy statement, the notice must be received
by  the  Corporation a reasonable time before such new  date
for the annual meeting of shareholders. Such notice referred
to  in  clause  (c)  hereof  shall  set  forth  (i)  a  full
description  of  each such item of business proposed  to  be
brought before the meeting, (ii) the name and address of the
person  proposing to bring such business before the meeting,
(iii)  the  class and number of shares held of record,  held
beneficially and represented by proxy by such person  as  of
the  record date for the meeting (if such date has then been
made  publicly available) and as of the date of such notice,
(iv) if any item of such business involves a nomination  for
director,  all information regarding each such nominee  that
would  be  required  to be set forth in a  definitive  proxy
statement  filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission
(the  "SEC")  pursuant  to  Section  14  of  the  Securities
Exchange  Act of 1934, as amended (the "Exchange  Act"),  or
any  successor thereto, and the written consent of each such
nominee to serve if elected, and (v) if so requested by  the
Corporation, all other information that would be required to
be  filed  with  the SEC if, with respect  to  the  business
proposed  to  be  brought  before the  meeting,  the  person
proposing  such business was a participant in a solicitation
subject  to Section 14 of the Exchange Act or any  successor
thereto. No business shall be brought before any meeting  of
shareholders of the Corporation otherwise than  as  provided
in  this  Section. Notwithstanding the foregoing  provision,
unless  otherwise  required by law, the Board  of  Directors
shall  not  be obligated to include information  as  to  any
nominee  for  director  in  any  proxy  statement  or  other
communication sent to shareholders. The presiding officer of
the meeting may, if the facts warrant, determine and declare
to  the  meeting that any proposed item of business was  not
brought  before the meeting in accordance with the foregoing
procedures, and if he or she should so determine, he or  she
shall  so declare at the meeting and the defective  item  of
business shall be disregarded.

                         Article III
Board of Directors

  Section  1.  Number  of Directors; Election;  Tenure.  The
number  of  directors which shall constitute  the  Board  of
Directors  shall  not be less than ten (10)  nor  more  than
twenty  (20)  members.  Within these limits  the  number  of
directors  constituting the Board shall be  determined  from
time to time by resolution of the Board of Directors, or  by
the shareholders at an annual or special meeting. Except  as
otherwise hereinafter provided in the case of vacancies, the
directors shall be elected by the shareholders at the annual
meeting.  The holders of Class A Common Stock  voting  as  a
separate  class  shall be entitled to elect that  number  of
directors which constitutes 30% of the authorized number  of
members  of  the  Board of Directors  and,  if  30%  of  the
authorized  number of directors is not a whole  number,  the
holders  of Class A Common Stock shall be entitled to  elect
the nearest higher whole number of directors that is a least
30%  of  such  membership. Holders of Class B  Common  Stock
voting  as  a separate class shall be entitled to elect  the
remaining  directors. Each director shall hold office  until
the election and qualification of his or her successor.

  Section 2. Qualification of Directors. A director must  be
at least 18 years of age and not have attained age 70 on the
first  day of the month in which the annual meeting  occurs.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Board of Directors may in
its discretion vote to nominate for election a person who by
reason of having attained age 70 would otherwise cease to be
qualified  under  this provision, if it deems  that  special
circumstances justify such action.

   Section  3.  Nomination  of  Directors.  Nominations  for
election to the Board of Directors of the Corporation  at  a
meeting  of the shareholders may be made only by the  Board,
or  on  behalf  of  the  Board by any  nominating  committee
appointed  by  the  Board,  or by  any  shareholder  of  the
Corporation  entitled to vote for the election of  directors
of  the  class  for which such nomination is  submitted  who
complies  with the notice procedures set forth  in  the  By
laws.

  Section  4. Director Emeritus. The Board of Directors  may
designate one or more former directors as director emeritus,
which  position  shall be entirely honorary  and  shall  not
confer upon the director emeritus any of the powers, duties,
rights or liabilities of a director.

  Section 5. Vacancies.  If any vacancy occurs in the  Board
of   Directors   by   reason  of  the  death,   resignation,
retirement, or removal from office of any director  with  or
without  cause, or if any new directorship is created,  such
vacancy shall be filled by the holders of the class of stock
entitled to elect a director to fill such a vacancy or by  a
majority  of  the directors then in office of the  class  in
which such a vacancy occurs, though less than a quorum,  all
in  manner prescribed by the Certificate of Incorporation of
the Corporation.

 Section 6. Regular Meetings of the Board. The first regular
meeting  of each newly elected Board of Directors  shall  be
held as soon as practicable after the annual meeting of  the
shareholders for the purpose of the election or  appointment
of  officers  and  the transaction of other business.  Other
regular  meetings  of  the Board of Directors  may  be  held
without notice at such time and place as shall, from time to
time, be determined by the Board.

     Section  7. Special Meetings; Notice. Special meetings
of the  Board of Directors may be called by the Chairman of
the Board  or by the president at any time, and shall be
called
                           -3-
<PAGE>

by  the  chairman, president, or secretary  at  the  written
request  of  two members of the Board. Notice of  a  special
meeting  shall  be given to each director in writing  either
personally,  by  next  day  courier  delivery  service,   by
telegram at least two days prior to the meeting, or by  mail
at  least  four days prior to the meeting. If  mailed,  such
notice shall be deemed given when deposited properly stamped
and  addressed in the United States mail. If telegraphed  or
by  next  day delivery service, such notice shall be  deemed
given when delivered properly addressed to the telegraph  or
courier  company. Notice of meeting need not be given  to  a
director who submits a signed waiver of notice either before
or  after  the  meeting. The attendance of a director  at  a
meeting  without protest as to the sufficiency of notice  of
such  meeting shall constitute a waiver by such director  of
such notice.

  Section  8.  Quorum.  At  all meetings  of  the  Board  of
Directors, a majority of the entire Board shall be requisite
to  and  shall  constitute a quorum for the  transaction  of
business. If a quorum shall not be present at any meeting of
the  Board  of  Directors, a majority of those  present  may
adjourn  the meeting from time to time until a quorum  shall
be present.

  Section  9. Executive and Policy Committee. The  Board  of
Directors  may  elect from among its members, by  resolution
adopted  by a majority of the entire Board of Directors,  an
Executive  and Policy Committee consisting of four  or  more
members  of  the  Board (at least one of  whom  shall  be  a
director elected by the holders of Class A common shares and
none of whom shall be an employee of the Corporation or  any
of its subsidiaries). From among such committee members, the
Board shall elect a chairman of such committee.
  Section 10. Duties of Executive and Policy Committee.  (a)
During  the  intervals  between meetings  of  the  Board  of
Directors, the Executive and Policy Committee shall, subject
to any limitations imposed by law or the Board of Directors,
possess  and it may exercise all the powers of the Board  of
Directors in the management and direction of the Corporation
in  such manner as the Executive and Policy Committee  shall
deem  best  for  the interests of the Corporation.  (b)  The
Executive    and   Policy   Committee   shall   also    have
responsibility, together with the Chairman of the Board, for
review  of corporate objectives and strategies and  policies
formulated  by  senior  management to  attain  them.  It  is
authorized  to assist management in developing and  refining
such  policies  as  it deems appropriate, to  monitor  their
implementation,   and  to  evaluate  the   chief   executive
officer's performance in connection therewith. The Executive
and  Policy Committee shall monitor and report to the  Board
its  recommendations  and observations  in  respect  of  all
matters  within its charge and shall also serve as  a  focal
point  for communication between non-committee directors  as
their  duties  relate  to  the  matters  described  in   the
preceding sentence.

  Section  11. Other Committees. The Board of Directors  may
also elect from among its members, by resolutions adopted by
a  majority  of  the entire Board of Directors,  such  other
committee  or  committees as the Board  of  Directors  shall
determine, each such committee to consist of at least  three
members  of  the Board. The Board shall elect a chairman  of
each  such  committee, shall fix the number  and  elect  the
other  members thereof, and shall establish the  duties  and
authority  thereof, subject to such limitations  as  may  be
required by law.

  Section  12.  Committee Vacancies. The Board of  Directors
shall  fill any vacancies on any committee established under
this  Article, with the objective of keeping the  membership
of each such committee at the authorized level.

  Section  13.  Action  by Committees.  All  action  by  any
committee of the Board of Directors shall be referred to the
Board  of  Directors  at its meeting  next  succeeding  such
action,  and  shall be subject to revision or alteration  by
the  Board of Directors, provided that no rights or acts  of
third  parties  shall be affected by any  such  revision  or
alteration. Subject to such applicable resolutions as may be
adopted by the Board, each committee shall fix its own rules
of  procedure as deemed appropriate, but in any case, except
as  the Board explicitly otherwise provides, the presence of
a majority shall be necessary to constitute a quorum.

  Section 14. Action of the Board. All corporate action
taken by  the Board of Directors or any committee thereof
shall be taken  at a meeting of such Board or committee, as
                          -4-
<PAGE>

the  case may  be, except that any action required or
permitted to  be taken  at  a  meeting of the Board or any
committee  may  be taken  without  a meeting, if all members
of  the  Board  or committee,  as the case may be, consent
in writing  to  such action  and  the  writing or writings
are  filed  with  the minutes  of  the proceedings of the
Board or committee.  Any one  or  more  members  of the

provided  by  law, the vote of a majority of  all  directors
present at the time of the vote, voting together as a single
class, if a quorum is present at such time, shall be the act
of the Board or any committee.

not be deemed officers of the Corporation but shall have  as
between  themselves and the Corporation such  authority  and
perform  such  duties in the management of the  division  in
which they are appointed as the Board may from time to  time
determine,   and  shall  have  such  authority  as   between

                           -6-
<PAGE>

division for which they are appointed, as would generally be

implementation of internal accounting controls and financial

officers  of the Corporation shall be fixed by the Board  of
Directors. The compensation of division officers,  assistant
officers, if any, and of other employees shall be  fixed  by

                          Article V

  Section   1.  Description  of  Stock  Certificates.    The
certificates   of  stock  of  this  Corporation   shall   be
consecutively  numbered by class and  shall  be  entered  on
books of the Corporation as they are issued. They shall show
the  holder's  name and the number of shares  and  shall  be
signed  by  the chairman of the Board, the president,  or  a
vice  president,  and  countersigned  by  the  secretary  or
treasurer, and shall have the seal of the Corporation, which
may be a facsimile,  affixed  thereto.  Whenever     any
certificate  is  countersigned  by  a  transfer  agent,   or
registered by a registrar, other than the Corporation itself
or  an  employee  of  the  Corporation,  the  signatures  of
officers  of  the Corporation upon such certificate  may  be
facsimiles. If an officer who has signed or whose  facsimile
signature has been placed upon a certificate shall no longer
hold  such  office  when  the  certificate  is  issued,  the
certificate  may  nevertheless be issued by the  Corporation
with  the  same effect as if the officer were still  holding
such office at the date of the issue.

  Section  2.  Transfer  of Stock.  Upon  surrender  to  the
Corporation  or any transfer agent of the Corporation  of  a
certificate  for  shares  duly endorsed  or  accompanied  by
proper  evidence of succession, assignment or  authority  to
transfer,  together  with all necessary  federal  and  state
transfer tax stamps affixed thereto, it shall be the duty of
the  Corporation  or  such transfer agent  to  issue  a  new
certificate to the person entitled thereto, cancel  the  old
certificate, and record the transaction upon its books.

  Section  3.  Fixing  Record  Date.  For  the  purpose  of
determining  the shareholders entitled to notice  of  or  to
vote  at  any  meeting of shareholders  or  any  adjournment
thereof,  or  to  express consent to  or  dissent  from  any
proposal without  a  meeting,  or  for  the   purpose     or
determining shareholders entitled to receive payment of  any
dividend or the allotment of any rights, or for the  purpose
of  any  other action, the Board of Directors shall fix,  in
advance, a date  as  the  record  date  for   any   such
determination of shareholders. Such date shall not  be  more
than  fifty nor less than ten days before the date  of  such
meeting, nor more than fifty days prior to any other action.

  Section 4. Registered Shareholders. The Corporation  shall
be  entitled to recognize the exclusive right of  a  person,
                         -7-
<PAGE>

registered  on its books as the owner of shares, to  receive
dividends or other distributions, and vote as such owner and
otherwise treat such person as the owner of such shares  and
accordingly shall not be bound to recognize any equitable or
other claim to or interest in such shares on the part of any
other  person, whether or not it shall have express or other
notice  thereof except as expressly provided by the laws  of
the State of New York.

  Section  5. Lost Certificates. The Board of Directors  may
direct the issuance of a new stock certificate in place of a
certificate theretofore issued by the Corporation  which  is
alleged  to have been lost or destroyed. The person claiming
such  loss or destruction shall submit an affidavit  of  the
fact  in  form  satisfactory to the Board of Directors.  The
Board  of  Directors,  in its discretion  and  as  condition
precedent  to  the  issuance of  the  new  certificate,  may
require  the owner of such lost or destroyed certificate  or
his  legal representative to give the Corporation a suitable
bond  in such sum as it may direct as indemnity against  any
claims that may be made against the Corporation with respect
to  the  certificate alleged to have been lost or  destroyed
and  to  satisfy such other reasonable conditions as it  may
impose.

  Section 6. Stock Regulations. The Board of Directors shall
have  the  authority  to  make all such  further  rules  and
regulations, not inconsistent with the laws of the State  of
New  York,  as it may deem expedient, concerning the  issue,
transfer,   conversion,  and  registration  of  certificates
representing shares of the Corporation, and may appoint  one
or more transfer agents and one or more registrars.

Indemnification of Officers and Directors

  Section 1. General. The Corporation shall, to the  fullest
extent permitted by the New York Business Corporation Law as
the  same exists or may hereafter be amended, indemnify  any
director  or  officer of the Corporation or any wholly-owned
subsidiary (or the personal representative of such  director
or  officer) who is or was made or threatened to be  made  a
party  to  or  is  involved in any threatened,  pending,  or
completed  action,  suit,  or  proceeding,  whether   civil,
criminal,  administrative,  or investigative  (including  an
action  by or in the right of the Corporation or any of  its
subsidiaries or any other corporation, domestic or  foreign,
or  any  partnership, joint venture, trust, employee benefit
plan, or other enterprise), by reason of the fact that he or
she  is or was a director or officer of the Corporation, or,
at  the  request of the Corporation, is or was serving  such
subsidiary or other corporation, partnership, joint venture,
trust,  employee  benefit  plan,  or  other  enterprise   as
director,  officer,  trustee,  or  in  any  other  capacity,
against  judgments, fines, amounts paid or  to  be  paid  in
settlement, excise tax or penalties, and costs, charges  and
expenses,  including attorneys' fees, incurred in connection
with  such  action  or  proceeding or  any  appeal  therein;
provided, however, that no indemnification shall be provided
to any such person if a judgment or other final adjudication
adverse to such person establishes that (i) his or her  acts
                          -8-
<PAGE>

 (or  those  of the testator or intestate) were committed
in bad  faith  or  were  the  result of active  and
deliberate dishonesty and, in either case, were material to
the  cause of action so adjudicated, or (ii) he or she (or
the testator or  intestate) personally gained in fact a
financial  profit or  other  advantage  to which he or  she
was  not  legally entitled; provided, further, that where
applicable,  payment of  such  indemnification  shall be
made  pursuant  to  the provisions   of  Section  723  of
the  New  York   Business Corporation  Law, as the same may
be amended  from  time  to time.

  Section 2. Non-Exclusivity of Rights. The Corporation  may
indemnify any person to whom the Corporation is permitted to
provide  indemnification or the advancement of  expenses  by
applicable  law, whether pursuant to rights granted  to,  or
provided by, the New York Business Corporation Law or  other
rights  created by (i) a resolution of shareholders, (ii)  a
resolution of the Board of Directors, or (iii) an  agreement
providing for such indemnification. The rights conferred  in
this  Article VII shall not be exclusive of any other  right
of  indemnification,  or  reimbursement  or  advancement  of
expenses which any person may have or hereafter acquire.

  Section 3. Expenses. The Corporation shall, from  time  to
time,  reimburse  or advance to any person  referred  to  in
Section  1  of  this  Article VII the  funds  necessary  for
payment of expenses, including attorneys' fees, incurred  in
connection  with  any action or proceeding  referred  to  in
Section  1, upon receipt of a written undertaking by  or  on
behalf  of such person to repay such amount(s) if a judgment
or  other  final  adjudication adverse to  the  director  or
officer  establishes that (i) his or her acts were committed
in  bad  faith  or were the result of active and  deliberate
dishonesty and, in either case, were material to  the  cause
of  action  so  adjudicated, or (ii) he  or  she  personally
gained  in  fact  a financial profit or other  advantage  to
which he or she was not legally entitled.

  Section 4. Other Rights. The right to be indemnified or to
the  reimbursement  or advancement of expenses  pursuant  to
this  Article VII (i) is a contract right pursuant to  which
the  person  entitled  thereto may  bring  suit  as  if  the
provision  hereof  were  set forth  in  a  separate  written
contract  between  the  Corporation  and  the  director   or
officer,  (ii) is intended to be retroactive  and  shall  be
available  with  respect to events occurring  prior  to  the
adoption thereof and (iii) shall continue to exist after the
rescission or restrictive modification of the provisions  of
this  Article  VII, with respect to events  occurring  prior
thereto.

  Section 5. Insurance. Subject to the provisions of Section
726   of   the  New  York  Business  Corporation  Law,   the
Corporation  may  maintain insurance,  at  its  expense,  to
protect itself and any director, officer, employee, or agent
of  the  Corporation  or  another corporation,  partnership,
joint  venture, trust, or other enterprise against any  such
expense,  liability, or loss, whether or not the Corporation
would  have the power to indemnify such person against  such
expense,  liability,  or loss under the  New  York  Business
Corporation Law.

  Section  6.  Service with Another Corporation or  Employee
Benefit  Plan.  Any director or officer of  the  Corporation
serving (i) another corporation of which a majority  of  the
shares entitled to vote in the election of its directors  is
held  by the Corporation, or (ii) any employee benefit  plan
of  the Corporation or any corporation referred to in clause
(i),  in  any  capacity shall, unless  and  until  otherwise
expressly provided by a resolution of the Board of Directors
of  the Corporation, be deemed to be doing so at the request
of the Corporation.

  Section 7. Action to Enforce Right to Indemnification. If a
request  to  be  indemnified or  for  the  reimbursement  or
advancement of expenses pursuant hereto is not paid in  full
by  the Corporation within thirty days after a written claim
has  been received by the Corporation, the claimant  may  at
any  time  thereafter bring suit against the Corporation  to
recover  the  unpaid amount of the claim and,  if  entitled,
also  to  be  paid the expenses of prosecuting  such  claim.
Neither the failure of the Corporation (including its  Board
of
                         -9-
<PAGE>

Directors,   independent   legal   counsel,   or   its
shareholders)  to  have made a determination  prior  to  the
commencement  of  such  action that  indemnification  of  or
reimbursement or advancement of expenses to the claimant  is
proper in the circumstances, nor an actual determination  by
the   Corporation   (including  its  Board   of   Directors,
independent  legal  counsel, or its shareholders)  that  the
claimant  is  not  entitled  to indemnification  or  to  the
reimbursement or advancement of expenses, shall be a defense
to  the action or create a presumption that the claimant  is
not so entitled.

  Section  8.  Exclusive  Remedy.  A  person  who  has  been
successful, on the merits or otherwise, in the defense of  a
civil  or  criminal action or proceeding  of  the  character
described  in Section 1 shall be entitled to indemnification
only  as  provided in Sections 1 and 3, notwithstanding  any
provision  of the New York Business Corporation Law  to  the
contrary.

  Section 9. Separability. If this Article VII or any portion
hereby  shall be invalidated on any ground by any  court  of
competent   jurisdiction,   then   the   Corporation   shall
nevertheless indemnify each director, officer, employee,  or
agent  of  the Corporation as to costs, charges and expenses
(including  attorneys' fees), judgments, fines  and  amounts
paid  in  settlement  with respect to any  action,  suit  or
proceeding,  whether  civil,  criminal,  administrative   or
investigative, including an action by or in the right of the
Corporation,  to  the  fullest  extent  permitted   by   any
applicable portion of this Article VII that shall  not  have
been  invalidated  and to the fullest  extent  permitted  by
applicable law.

                        Article VIII

multiple of $1,000,000 (except that any such Borrowing may

Period under this Section 2.01.

          SECTION 2.02.  Method of Borrowing.  (a)  The
Borrower shall give the Agent notice (a "Notice of
Borrowing") not later than 10:30 A.M. (New York City time)

to the provisions of the definition of Interest Period.

     (b)  Upon receipt of a Notice of Borrowing, the
Agent shall promptly notify each Bank of the contents
thereof and of such Bank's ratable share of such Borrowing
and such Notice of Borrowing shall not thereafter be
revocable by the Borrower.

     (c)  Not later than 12:00 noon (New York City
time) on the date of each Borrowing, each Bank shall (except
as provided in subsection (d) of this Section) make
available its ratable share of such Borrowing (determined in
accordance with Section 2.01), in Federal or other funds
immediately available in New York City, to the Agent at its
address specified in or pursuant to Section 9.01.  Unless
the Agent determines in its reasonable judgment that any
applicable condition specified in Article III has not been
satisfied, the Agent will make the funds so received from
the Banks available to the Borrower at the Agent's aforesaid
address.

     (d)  If any Bank makes a new Loan hereunder on a day on
which the Borrower is to repay all or any part of an
outstanding Loan from such Bank, such Bank shall apply the
proceeds of its new Loan to make such repayment and only an
amount equal to the difference (if any) between the amount
being borrowed and the amount being repaid shall be made
available by such Bank to the Agent as provided in
subsection (c) of this Section, or remitted by the Borrower
to the Agent as provided in Section 2.10, as the case may
be.

     (e)  Unless the Agent shall have received notice from a
Bank prior to the date of any Borrowing that such Bank will
not make available to the Agent such Bank's share of such
Borrowing, the Agent may assume that such Bank has made such
share available to the Agent on the date of such Borrowing
in accordance with subsections (c) and (d) of this Section
2.02 and the Agent may, in reliance upon such assumption,
make available to the Borrower on such date a corresponding
amount.  If and to the extent that such Bank shall not have
so made such share available to the Agent, such Bank and the
Borrower severally agree to repay to the Agent forthwith on
demand such corresponding amount together with interest
thereon, for each day from the date such amount is made

<PAGE>

available to the Borrower until the date such amount is
repaid to the Agent, at (i) in the case of the Borrower, a
rate per annum equal to the higher of the Federal Funds Rate

this Agreement.

Agent, request that its Loans of a particular type be
evidenced by a separate Note in an amount equal to the
aggregate unpaid principal amount of such Loans.  Each such
Note shall be in substantially the form of Exhibit A hereto
with appropriate modifications to reflect the fact that it
evidences solely Loans of the relevant type.  Each reference
in this Agreement to the "Note" of such Bank shall be deemed
to refer to and include any or all of such Notes, as the
context may require.

     (c)  Upon receipt of each Bank's Note pursuant to
Section 3.01(b), the Agent shall forward such Note to such
Bank.  Each Bank shall record the date, amount, type and
maturity of each Loan made by it and the date and amount of
each payment of principal made by the Borrower with respect
thereto, and may, if such Bank so elects in connection with
any transfer or enforcement of its Note, endorse on the
schedule forming a part thereof appropriate notations to
evidence the foregoing information with respect to each such
Loan then outstanding; provided that the failure of any Bank
to make any such recordation or endorsement shall not affect
the obligations of the Borrower hereunder or under the
Notes.  Each Bank is hereby irrevocably authorized by the
Borrower so to endorse its Note and to attach to and make a
part of its Note a continuation of any such schedule as and
when required.

     SECTION   2.04.  Maturity of Loans.  Each Loan included

clause (2)(b) of the definition of Interest Period, have an
Interest Period of less than 30 days, such CD Loan shall
bear interest during such Interest Period at the rate
applicable to Base Rate Loans during such period.  Such
interest shall be payable for each Interest Period on the
last day thereof and, if such Interest Period is longer than
90 days, at intervals of 90 days after the first day
thereof.  Any overdue principal of and overdue interest on
any CD Loan shall bear interest, payable on demand, for each
day until paid at a rate per annum equal to the sum of 1%
plus the higher of (i) the sum of the Applicable Margin plus
the Adjusted CD Rate applicable to such Loan and (ii) the
Base Rate for such day.

Period means a rate per annum determined pursuant to the
following formula:

               [ CDBR       ]*
     ACDR   =  [ ---------- ]  + AR
               [ 1.00 - DRP ]

     ACDR   =  Adjusted CD Rate
     CDBR   =  CD Base Rate
      DRP   =  Domestic Reserve Percentage

provision) to the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (or

Interest Period is to apply and for a period of time
comparable to such Interest Period.

     "Euro-Dollar Reserve Percentage" means for any day that
percentage (expressed as a decimal) which is in effect on

Borrower may, upon at least three Domestic Business Days'
notice to the Agent, terminate at any time, or
proportionately reduce from time to time by an aggregate
amount of $1,000,000 or any larger multiple of $1,000,000,
the unused portions of the Commitments.  If the Commitments
are terminated in their entirety, all accrued fees shall be
payable on the effective date of such termination.

     SECTION 2.08.  Mandatory Termination of Commitments.
The Commitments shall terminate on the Termination Date and
any Loans then outstanding (together with accrued interest
thereon) shall be due and payable on such date.

     SECTION 2.09.  Optional Prepayments.  (a)  The Borrower
may, upon at least one Domestic Business Day's notice to the
Agent, prepay any Base Rate Borrowing in whole at any time,
or from time to time in part in amounts aggregating
$1,000,000 or any larger multiple of $1,000,000, by paying
the principal amount to be prepaid together with accrued
interest thereon to the date of prepayment.  Each such
optional prepayment shall be applied to prepay ratably the
Loans of the several Banks included in such Borrowing.

     (b)  Except as provided in Section 8.02, the Borrower
may not prepay all or any portion of the principal amount of
any Fixed Rate Loan prior to the maturity thereof.

     (c)  Upon receipt of a notice of prepayment
pursuant to this Section, the Agent shall promptly notify
each Bank of the contents thereof and of such Bank's ratable
share of such prepayment and such notice shall not
thereafter be revocable by the Borrower.

     SECTION 2.10.  General Provisions as to Payments.
(a)  The Borrower shall make each payment of principal of,
and interest on, the Loans and of facility fees hereunder,
not later than 12:00 noon (New York City time) on the date
when due, in Federal or other funds immediately available in
New York City, to the Agent at its address referred to in
Section 9.01.  The Agent will promptly distribute to each
Bank its ratable share of each such payment received by the

<PAGE>

Agent for the account of the Banks.  Whenever any payment of
principal of, or interest on, the Domestic Loans or of
facility fees shall be due on a day which is not a Domestic
Business Day, the date for payment thereof shall be extended
to the next succeeding Domestic Business Day.  Whenever any
payment of principal of, or interest on, the Euro-Dollar
Loans shall be due on a day which is not a Euro-Dollar
Business Day, the date for payment thereof shall be extended
to the next succeeding Euro-Dollar Business Day unless such
Euro-Dollar Business Day falls in another calendar month, in
which case the date for payment thereof shall be the next
preceding Euro-Dollar Business Day.  If the date for any
payment of principal is extended by operation of law or
otherwise, interest thereon shall be payable for such
extended time.

     (b)  Unless the Agent shall have received notice from
the Borrower prior to the date on which any payment is due
to the Banks hereunder that the Borrower will not make such
payment in full, the Agent may assume that the Borrower has
made such payment in full to the Agent on such date and the
Agent may, in reliance upon such assumption, cause to be
distributed to each Bank on such due date an amount equal to
the amount then due such Bank.  If and to the extent that
the Borrower shall not have so made such payment, each Bank
shall repay to the Agent forthwith on demand such amount
distributed to such Bank together with interest thereon, for
each day from the date such amount is distributed to such
Bank until the date such Bank repays such amount to the
Agent, at the Federal Funds Rate.

     SECTION 2.11.  Funding Losses.  If the Borrower makes
any payment of principal with respect to any Fixed Rate Loan
(pursuant to Article VI or VIII or otherwise) on any day
other than the last day of the Interest Period applicable
thereto, or the end of an applicable period fixed pursuant
to Section 2.05(d), or if the Borrower fails to borrow any
Fixed Rate Loans after notice has been given to any Bank in
accordance with Section 2.02(b), the Borrower shall
reimburse each Bank within 15 days after demand for any
resulting loss or expense incurred by it (or by an existing
or prospective Participant in the related Loan), including
(without limitation) any loss incurred in obtaining,
liquidating or employing deposits from third parties, but
excluding loss of margin for the period after any such
payment or failure to borrow, provided that such Bank shall
have delivered to the Borrower a certificate as to the
amount of such loss or expense, which certificate shall be
conclusive in the absence of manifest error.

     SECTION 2.12.  Computation of Interest and Fees.
Interest based on the Prime Rate hereunder and facility fees
shall be computed on the basis of a year of 365 days (or 366

<PAGE>

days in a leap year) and paid for the actual number of days
elapsed (including the first day but excluding the last
day).  All other interest shall be computed on the basis of
a year of 360 days and paid for the actual number of days
elapsed (including the first day but excluding the last
day).

     SECTION 2.13.  Withholding Tax Exemption.  At least
five Domestic Business Days prior to the first date on which
interest or fees are payable hereunder for the account of
any Bank, each Bank that is not incorporated under the laws
of the United States of America or a state thereof agrees
that it will deliver to each of the Borrower and the Agent
two duly completed copies of United States Internal Revenue
Service Form 1001 or 4224, certifying in either case that
such Bank is entitled to receive payments under this
Agreement and the Notes without deduction or withholding of
any United States federal income taxes.  Each Bank which so
delivers a Form 1001 or 4224 further undertakes to deliver
to each of the Borrower and the Agent two additional copies
of such form (or a successor form) on or before the date
that such form expires or becomes obsolete or after the
occurrence of any event requiring a change in the most
recent form so delivered by it, and such amendments thereto
or extensions or renewals thereof as may be reasonably
requested by the Borrower or the Agent, in each case
certifying that such Bank is entitled to receive payments
under this Agreement and the Notes without deduction or
withholding of any United States federal income taxes,
unless an event (including without limitation any change in
treaty, law or regulation) has occurred prior to the date on
which any such delivery would otherwise be required which
renders all such forms inapplicable or which would prevent
such Bank from duly completing and delivering any such form
with respect to it and such Bank advises the Borrower and
the Agent that it is not capable of receiving payments
without any deduction or withholding of United States
federal income tax.

     SECTION 2.14.  Change of Control.  If a Change of
Control shall occur (i) the Borrower will, promptly and in
any event within 20 days after the occurrence thereof, give
each Bank notice thereof and shall describe in reasonable
detail the facts and circumstances giving rise thereto and
(ii) each Bank may, by notice to the Borrower and the Agent
given not later than 20 days after such notice of Change of
Control shall have been given, terminate its Commitment,
which shall be terminated 45 days after such notice of
Change of Control shall have been given, and declare the
Note held by it, together with accrued interest thereon, and

<PAGE>

any other amounts payable hereunder for its account to be,
and such Note and such other amounts shall thereupon become,
due and payable on such forty-fifth day without presentment,
demand, protest or other notice of any kind, all of which
are hereby waived by the Borrower; provided that no Bank
shall be obligated, without its written consent given at the
time, to make a Loan to be included in any Borrowing other
than a Refunding Borrowing during the period from and
including the date of any such Change of Control to and
including the forty-fifth day following such notice of
Change of Control.

the ERISA Group has fulfilled its obligations under the
minimum funding standards of ERISA and the Internal Revenue
Code with respect to each Plan and is in compliance in all

governmental charges are, in the opinion of the Borrower,
adequate.

corporate Subsidiaries is a corporation duly incorporated,

Borrower under this Agreement and the Notes to pay the

relating to any obligation with respect to Material Debt or
Material Financial Obligations of the Borrower or any

become due and payable prior to its stated maturity or the
obligations of the Borrower or any Subsidiary under any
obligation with respect to Material Debt or Material
Financial Obligations to become due and payable;

     (f)  the Borrower or any Subsidiary shall commence a

                         ARTICLE VII

                          THE AGENT

     SECTION 7.01.  Appointment and Authorization. Each Bank
irrevocably appoints and authorizes the Agent to take such
action as agent on its behalf and to exercise such powers
under this Agreement and the Notes as are delegated to the
Agent by the terms hereof or thereof, together with
all such powers as are reasonably incidental thereto.

     SECTION 7.02.  Agent and Affiliates.  Morgan and its
affiliates may accept deposits from, lend money to, and
generally engage in any kind of business with the Borrower
or any Subsidiary or affiliate of the Borrower as if it were
not the Agent hereunder.

     SECTION 7.03.  Action by Agent.  The obligations of the
Agent hereunder are only those expressly set forth herein.
Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the Agent
shall not be required to take any action with respect to any
Default, except as expressly provided in Article VI.

     SECTION 7.04.  Consultation with Experts.  The Agent
may consult with legal counsel (who may be counsel for the
Borrower), independent public accountants and other experts
selected by it and shall not be liable for any action taken
or omitted to be taken by it in good faith in accordance
with the advice of such counsel, accountants or experts.

     SECTION 7.05.  Liability of Agent.  Neither the Agent
nor any of its affiliates nor any of their respective
directors, officers, agents or employees shall be liable for
any action taken or not taken by it in connection herewith
(i) with the consent or at the request of the Required Banks
or (ii) in the absence of its own gross negligence or
willful misconduct.  Neither the Agent nor any of its
affiliates nor any of their respective directors, officers,
agents or employees shall be responsible for or have any
duty to ascertain, inquire into or verify (i) any statement,

<PAGE>

warranty or representation made in connection with this
Agreement or any borrowing hereunder; (ii) the performance
or observance of any of the covenants or agreements of the
Borrower; (iii) the satisfaction of any condition specified
in Article III, except receipt of items required to be
delivered to the Agent; or (iv) the validity, effectiveness
or genuineness of this Agreement, the Notes or any other
instrument or writing furnished in connection herewith.  The
Agent shall not incur any liability by acting in reliance
upon any notice, consent, certificate, statement, or other
writing (which may be a bank wire, telex, facsimile or
similar writing) believed by it to be genuine or to be
signed by the proper party or parties.

     SECTION 7.06.  Indemnification.  Each Bank shall,
ratably in accordance with its Commitment, indemnify the
Agent, its affiliates and their respective directors,
officers, agents and employees (to the extent not reimbursed
by the Borrower) against any cost, expense (including
counsel fees and disbursements), claim, demand, action, loss
or liability (except such as result from such indemnitees'
gross negligence or willful misconduct) that such
indemnitees may suffer or incur in connection with this
Agreement or any action taken or omitted by such indemnitees
hereunder.

     SECTION 7.07.  Credit Decision.  Each Bank acknowledges
that it has, independently and without reliance upon the
Agent or any other Bank, and based on such documents and
information as it has deemed appropriate, made its own
credit analysis and decision to enter into this Agreement.
Each Bank also acknowledges that it will, independently and
without reliance upon the Agent or any
other Bank, and based on such documents and information as
it shall deem appropriate at the time, continue to make its
own credit decisions in taking or not taking any action
under this Agreement.

     SECTION 7.08.  Successor Agent.  The Agent may resign
at any time by giving notice thereof to the Banks and the
Borrower.  Upon any such resignation, the Required Banks
shall have the right, subject to approval by the Borrower,
to appoint a successor Agent, provided that approval of such
successor Agent by the Borrower shall not be unreasonably
withheld.  If no successor Agent shall have been so
appointed by the Required Banks, and shall have accepted
such appointment, within 30 days after the retiring Agent
gives notice of resignation, then the retiring Agent may, on
behalf of the Banks, appoint a successor Agent, which shall
be a commercial bank organized or licensed under the laws of
the United States of America or of any State thereof and

<PAGE>

having a combined capital and surplus of at least
$50,000,000.  Upon the acceptance of its appointment as
Agent hereunder by a successor Agent, such successor Agent
shall thereupon succeed to and become vested with all the
rights and duties of the retiring Agent, and the retiring
Agent shall be discharged from its duties and obligations
hereunder.  After any retiring Agent's resignation hereunder
as Agent, the provisions of this Article shall inure to its
benefit as to any actions taken or omitted to be taken by it
while it was Agent.

     SECTION 7.09.  Agent's Fee.  The Borrower shall pay to
the Agent for its own account fees in the amounts and at the
times previously agreed upon between the Borrower and the
Agent.

                       ARTICLE VIII

                 CHANGE IN CIRCUMSTANCES


     SECTION 8.01.  Basis for Determining Interest Rate
Inadequate or Unfair.  If on or prior to the first day of
any Interest Period for any Fixed Rate Borrowing:

     (a)  the Agent is advised by Morgan that deposits in
dollars (in the applicable amounts)
are not being offered to Morgan in the relevant
market for such Interest Period, or

     (b)  Banks having 50% or more of the aggregate amount
of the Commitments advise the Agent that the Adjusted CD
Rate or the Adjusted London Interbank Offered Rate, as the
case may be, as determined by the Agent will not adequately
and fairly reflect the cost to such Banks of funding their
CD Loans or Euro-Dollar Loans, as the case may be, for such
Interest Period,

the Agent shall forthwith give notice thereof to the
Borrower and the Banks, whereupon until the Agent notifies
the Borrower that the circumstances giving rise to such
suspension no longer exist, the obligations of the Banks to
make CD Loans or Euro-Dollar Loans, as the case may be,
shall be suspended.  Unless the Borrower notifies the Agent
at least two Domestic Business Days before the date of any
Fixed Rate Borrowing for which a Notice of Borrowing has
previously been given that it elects not to borrow on such
date, such Borrowing shall instead be made as a Base Rate
Borrowing.

<PAGE>

     SECTION 8.02.  Illegality.  If, on or after the date of
this Agreement, the adoption of any applicable law, rule or
regulation, or any change in any applicable law, rule or
regulation, or any change in the interpretation or
administration thereof by any governmental authority,
central bank or comparable agency charged with the
interpretation or administration thereof, or compliance by
any Bank (or its Euro-Dollar Lending Office) with any
request or directive (whether or not having the force of
law) of any such authority, central bank or comparable
agency shall make it unlawful or impossible for any Bank (or
its Euro-Dollar Lending Office) to make, maintain or fund
its Euro-Dollar Loans and such Bank shall so notify the
Agent, the Agent shall forthwith give notice thereof to the
other Banks and the Borrower, whereupon until such Bank
notifies the Borrower and the Agent that the circumstances
giving rise to such suspension no longer exist, the
obligation of such Bank to make Euro-Dollar Loans shall be
suspended.  Before giving any notice to the Agent pursuant
to this Section, such Bank shall designate a different Euro
Dollar Lending Office if such designation will avoid the
need for giving such notice and will not, in the judgment of
such Bank, be otherwise disadvantageous to such Bank.  If
such Bank shall determine that it may not lawfully continue
to maintain and fund any of its outstanding Euro-Dollar
Loans to maturity and shall so specify in such notice, the
Borrower shall immediately prepay in full the then
outstanding principal amount of each such Euro-Dollar Loan,
together with accrued interest thereon.  Concurrently with
prepaying each such Euro-Dollar Loan, the Borrower shall
borrow a Base Rate Loan in an equal principal amount from
such Bank (on which interest and principal shall be payable
contemporaneously with the related Euro-Dollar Loans of the
other Banks), and such Bank shall make such a Base Rate
Loan.

     SECTION 8.03.  Increased Cost and Reduced Return. (a)
If on or after the date hereof, the adoption of any
applicable law, rule or regulation, or any change in any
applicable law, rule or regulation, or any change in the
interpretation or administration thereof by any governmental
authority, central bank or comparable agency charged with
the interpretation or administration thereof, or compliance
by any Bank (or its Applicable Lending Office) with any
request or directive (whether or not having the force of
law) of any such authority, central bank or comparable
agency:

     (i)  shall subject any Bank (or its
Applicable Lending Office) to any tax, duty or

<PAGE>

other charge with respect to its Fixed Rate Loans, its Notes
or its obligation to make Fixed Rate Loans, or shall change
the basis of taxation of payments to any Bank (or its
Applicable Lending Office) of the principal of or interest
on its Fixed Rate Loans or any other amounts due under this
Agreement in respect of its Fixed Rate Loans or its
obligation to make Fixed Rate Loans (except for changes in
the rate of tax on the overall net income of such Bank or
its Applicable Lending Office imposed by the jurisdiction in
which such Bank's principal executive office or Applicable
Lending Office is located); or

     (ii)  shall impose, modify or deem applicable any
reserve, special deposit or similar requirement (including,
without limitation, any such requirement imposed by the
Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, but
excluding (A) with respect to any CD Loan any such requirement
included in an applicable Domestic Reserve Percentage and
(B) with respect to any Euro-Dollar Loan any such
requirement included in an applicable Euro-Dollar Reserve
Percentage) against assets of, deposits with or for the
account of, or credit extended by, any Bank (or its
Applicable Lending Office) or shall impose on any Bank (or
its Applicable Lending Office) or on the United States
market for certificates of deposit or the London interbank
market any other condition affecting its Fixed Rate Loans,
its Notes or its obligation to make Fixed Rate Loans;

and the result of any of the foregoing is to increase the
cost to such Bank (or its Applicable Lending Office) of
making or maintaining any Fixed Rate Loan, or to reduce the
amount of any sum received or receivable by such Bank (or
its Applicable Lending Office) under this Agreement or under
its Notes with respect thereto, by an amount deemed by such
Bank to be material, then, within 15 days after demand by
such Bank (with a copy to the Agent), the Borrower shall pay
to such Bank such additional amount or amounts as will
compensate such Bank for such increased cost or reduction.

     (b)  If any Bank shall have determined that, after
the date hereof, the adoption of any applicable law, rule or
regulation regarding capital adequacy, or any change in any
such law, rule or regulation, or any change in the
interpretation or administration thereof by any governmental

<PAGE>

authority, central bank or comparable agency charged with
the interpretation or administration thereof, or any request
or directive regarding capital adequacy (whether or not
having the force of law) of any such authority, central bank
or comparable agency, has or would have the effect of
reducing the rate of return on capital of such Bank (or its
Parent) as a consequence of such Bank's obligations
hereunder to a level below that which such Bank (or its
Parent) could have achieved but for such adoption, change or
compliance (taking into consideration its policies with
respect to capital adequacy) by an amount deemed by such
Bank to be material, then from time to time, within 15 days
after demand by such Bank (with a copy to the Agent), the
Borrower shall pay to such Bank such additional amount or
amounts as will compensate such Bank (or its Parent) for
such reduction.

          (c)  Each Bank will promptly notify the Borrower
and the Agent of any event of which it has knowledge,
occurring after the date hereof, which will entitle such
Bank to compensation pursuant to this Section and will
designate a different Applicable Lending Office if such
designation will avoid the need for, or reduce the amount
of, such compensation and will not, in the judgment of such
Bank, be otherwise disadvantageous to such Bank.  A
certificate of any Bank claiming compensation under this
Section and setting forth the additional amount or amounts
to be paid to it hereunder shall be conclusive in the
absence of manifest error.  In determining such amount, such
Bank may use any reasonable averaging and attribution
methods.

     SECTION 8.04.  Base Rate Loans Substituted for Affected
Fixed Rate Loans.  If (i) the obligation of any Bank to make
Euro-Dollar Loans has been suspended pursuant to Section
8.02 or (ii) any Bank has demanded compensation under
Section 8.03(a) and the Borrower shall, by at least five
Euro-Dollar Business Days' prior notice to such Bank through
the Agent, have elected that the provisions of this Section
shall apply to such Bank, then, unless and until such Bank
notifies the Borrower that the circumstances giving rise to
such suspension or demand for compensation no longer apply:

     (a)  all Loans which would otherwise be made
by such Bank as CD Loans or Euro-Dollar Loans, as
the case may be, shall be made instead as Base
Rate Loans (on which interest and principal shall be payable
contemporaneously with the related Fixed Rate Loans of the
other Banks), and

<PAGE>

     (b)  after each of its CD Loans or Euro-Dollar Loans,
as the case may be, has been repaid, all payments of
principal which would otherwise be applied to repay such
Fixed Rate Loans shall be applied to repay its Base Rate
Loans instead.

                       ARTICLE IX

                      MISCELLANEOUS

     SECTION 9.01.  Notices.  All notices, requests and
other communications to any party hereunder shall be in

facsimile number set forth in its Administrative
Questionnaire or (z) in the case of any party, such other
address or telex or facsimile number as such party may
hereafter specify for the purpose by notice to the Agent and
the Borrower.  Each such notice, request or other
communication shall be effective (i) if given by telex, when
such telex is transmitted to the telex number specified in
this Section and the appropriate answerback is received,
(ii) if given by mail, 72 hours after such communication is
deposited in the mails with first class postage prepaid,
addressed as aforesaid or (iii) if given by any other means,
when received at the address specified in this Section;
provided that notices to the Agent under Article II or
Article VIII shall not be effective until received.

     SECTION 9.02.  No Waivers.  No failure or delay by the
Agent or any Bank in exercising any right, power or
privilege hereunder or under any Note shall operate as a
waiver thereof nor shall any single or partial exercise
thereof preclude any other or further exercise thereof or
the exercise of any other right, power or privilege.  The
rights and remedies herein provided shall be cumulative and
not exclusive of any rights or remedies provided by law.

     SECTION 9.03.  Expenses; Documentary Taxes;
Indemnification.  (a)  The Borrower shall pay (i) all out-of
pocket expenses of the Agent, including fees and
disbursements of special counsel for the Agent, in
connection with the preparation of this Agreement, any
waiver or consent hereunder or any amendment hereof or any
Default or alleged Default hereunder and (ii) if an Event of
Default occurs, all out-of-pocket expenses incurred by the

<PAGE>

Agent or any Bank, including fees and disbursements of
counsel, in connection with such Event of Default and
collection and other enforcement proceedings resulting
therefrom.  The Borrower shall indemnify each Bank against
any transfer taxes, documentary taxes, assessments or
charges made by any governmental authority by reason of the
execution and delivery of this Agreement or the Notes.

     (b)  The Borrower agrees to indemnify the Agent and
each Bank, their respective affiliates and the respective
directors, officers, agents and employees of the foregoing
(each an "Indemnitee") and hold each Indemnitee harmless
from and against any and all damages, costs and expenses of
any kind (including, without limitation, the reasonable fees
and disbursements of counsel for any Indemnitee in
connection with any investigative, administrative or
judicial proceeding, whether or not such Indemnitee shall be
designated a party thereto) which may be incurred by any
Indemnitee, relating to or arising out of this Agreement or
any actual or proposed use of proceeds of Loans hereunder;
provided that no Indemnitee shall have the right to be
indemnified hereunder for its own gross negligence or
willful misconduct as determined by a court of competent
jurisdiction.  The Borrower shall not be liable for any
settlement effected without the Borrower's consent, which
consent shall not be unreasonably withheld.

     SECTION 9.04.  Sharing of Set-Offs.  Each Bank agrees
that if it shall, by exercising any right of set-off or
counterclaim or otherwise, receive payment of a proportion
of the aggregate amount of principal and interest due with
respect to any Note held by it which is greater than the
proportion received by any other Bank in respect of the
aggregate amount of principal and interest due with respect
to any Note held by such other Bank, the Bank receiving such
proportionately greater payment shall purchase such
participation in the Notes held by the other Banks, and such
other adjustments shall be made, as may be required so that
all such payments of principal and interest with respect to
the Notes held by the Banks shall be shared by the Banks pro
rata; provided that nothing in this Section shall impair the
right of any Bank to exercise any right of set-off or
counterclaim it may have and to apply the amount subject to
such exercise to the payment of indebtedness of the Borrower
other than its indebtedness under the Notes. The Borrower
agrees, to the fullest extent it may effectively do so under
applicable law, that any holder of a participation in a
Note, whether or not acquired pursuant to the foregoing
arrangements, may exercise rights of set-off or counterclaim
and other rights with respect to such participation as fully
as if such holder of a participation were a direct creditor
of the Borrower in the amount of such participation.

<PAGE>

     SECTION 9.05.  Amendments and Waivers.  Any provision
of this Agreement or the Notes may be amended or waived if,
but only if, such amendment or waiver is in writing and is
signed by the Borrower and the Required Banks
(and, if the rights or duties of the Agent are affected
thereby, by the Agent); provided that no such amendment or
waiver shall, unless signed by all the Banks, (i) increase
or decrease the Commitment of any Bank (except for a ratable
decrease in the Commitments of all Banks) or subject any
Bank to any additional obligation, (ii) reduce the principal
of, accrued interest on, or rate of interest on, any Loan or
any fees hereunder, (iii) postpone the date fixed for any
payment of principal of or interest on any Loan or any fees
hereunder or the Termination Date or (iv) change the
percentage of the Commitments or of the aggregate unpaid
principal amount of the Notes, or the number of Banks, which
shall be required for the Banks or any of them to take any
action under this Section or any other provision of this
Agreement.

     SECTION 9.06.  Successors and Assigns.  (a)  The
provisions of this Agreement shall be binding upon and inure
to the benefit of the parties hereto and their respective
successors and assigns, except that the Borrower may not
assign or otherwise transfer any of its rights under this
Agreement without the prior written consent of all Banks.

     (b)  Any Bank may at any time grant to one or more
banks or other institutions (each a "Participant")
participating interests in its Commitment or any or all of
its Loans.  In the event of any such grant by a Bank of a
participating interest to a Participant, whether or not upon
notice to the Borrower and the Agent, such Bank shall remain
responsible for the performance of its obligations
hereunder, and the Borrower and the Agent shall continue to
deal solely and directly with such Bank in connection with
such Bank's rights and obligations under this Agreement. Any
agreement pursuant to which any Bank may grant such a
participating interest shall provide that such Bank shall
retain the sole right and responsibility to enforce the
obligations of the Borrower hereunder including, without
limitation, the right to approve any amendment, modification
or waiver of any provision of this Agreement; provided that
such participation agreement may provide that such Bank will
not agree to any modification, amendment or waiver of this
Agreement described in clause (i), (ii) or (iii) of Section
9.05 without the consent of the Participant.  The Borrower
agrees that each Participant shall, to the extent provided
in its participation agreement, be entitled to the benefits

<PAGE>

of Article VIII with respect to its participating interest.
An assignment or other transfer which is not permitted by
subsection (c) or (d) below shall be given effect for
purposes of this Agreement only to the extent of a
participating interest granted in accordance with this
subsection (b).

     (c)  Any Bank may at any time assign to one or more
banks or other institutions (each an "Assignee") all, or a
proportionate part of all, of its rights and obligations
under this Agreement and the Notes, and such Assignee shall
assume such rights and obligations, pursuant to an
instrument executed by such Assignee and such transferor
Bank, with (and subject to) the subscribed consent of the
Borrower and the Agent; provided that if an Assignee is an
affiliate of such transferor Bank, no such consent shall be
required.  Upon execution and delivery of such an instrument
and payment by such Assignee to such transferor Bank of an
amount equal to the purchase price agreed between such
transferor Bank and such Assignee, such Assignee shall be a
Bank party to this Agreement and shall
have all the rights and obligations of a Bank with a
Commitment as set forth in such instrument of assumption,
and the transferor Bank shall be released from its
obligations hereunder to a corresponding extent, and no
further consent or action by any party shall be required.
Upon the consummation of any assignment pursuant to this
subsection (c), the transferor Bank, the Agent and the
Borrower shall make appropriate arrangements so that, if
required, a new Note is issued to the Assignee.  If the
Assignee is not incorporated under the laws of the United
States of America or a state thereof, it shall, prior to the
first date on which interest or fees are payable hereunder
for its account, deliver to the Borrower and the Agent
certification as to exemption from deduction or withholding
of any United States federal income taxes in accordance with
Section 2.13.

     (d)  Any Bank may at any time assign all or any portion
of its rights under this Agreement and its Note to a Federal
Reserve Bank.  No such assignment shall release the
transferor Bank from its obligations hereunder.

(e)  No Assignee, Participant or other transferee of

any Bank's rights shall be entitled to receive any greater
payment under Section 8.03 than such Bank would have been
entitled to receive with respect to the rights transferred,
unless such transfer is made with the Borrower's prior
written consent or by reason of the provisions of Section
8.02 or 8.03 requiring such Bank to designate a different
Applicable Lending Office under certain circumstances or at
a time when the circumstances giving rise to such greater
payment did not exist.

<PAGE>

     SECTION 9.07.  Collateral.  Each of the Banks
represents to the Agent and each of the other Banks that it
in good faith is not relying upon any "margin stock" (as
defined in Regulation U) as collateral in the extension or
maintenance of the credit provided for in this Agreement.

     SECTION 9.08.  New York Law.  This Agreement and each
Note shall be construed in accordance with and governed by
the law of the State of New York.

     SECTION 9.09.  Counterparts; Integration.  This
Agreement may be signed in any number of counterparts, each
of which shall be an original, with the same effect as if
the signatures thereto and hereto were upon the same
instrument.  This Agreement constitutes the entire agreement
and understanding among the parties hereto and supersedes
any and all prior agreements and understandings, oral or
written, relating to the subject matter hereof.

<PAGE>

     IN WITNESS WHEREOF, the parties hereto have caused this
Agreement to be duly executed by their respective authorized
officers as of the day and year first above written.

     For value received, JOHN WILEY & SONS, INC., a New York

outstanding shall be endorsed by the Bank on the schedule
attached hereto, or on a continuation of such schedule

failure of the Bank to make any such recordation or
endorsement shall not affect the obligations of the Borrower

                        OPINION OF
                  COUNSEL FOR THE BORROWER


                                          March 30, 1995

To the Banks and the Agent
     Referred to Below
c/o Morgan Guaranty Trust Company
     of New York, as Agent
60 Wall Street
New York, New York  10260-0060

Dear Sirs:

     I am counsel for John Wiley & Sons, Inc., a New York
corporation (the "Borrower") and have acted as counsel to
the Borrower in connection with the Credit Agreement (the
"Agreement") dated as of March 30, 1995 among the Borrower,
the banks named therein and Morgan Guaranty Trust Company of
New York, as Agent.  Terms defined in the Agreement are used
herein as therein defined.

     I have examined originals or copies, certified or
otherwise identified to my satisfaction, of such documents,
corporate records, certificates of public officials and
other instruments and have conducted such other
investigations of fact and law as we have deemed necessary
or advisable for purposes of this opinion.

     Upon the basis of the foregoing, we are of the opinion
that:

     1.  The Borrower is a corporation duly

incorporated, validly existing and in good standing under
the laws of the State of New York, and has all corporate
powers and all material governmental licenses,
authorizations, consents and approvals required to carry on
its business as now conducted.

<PAGE>

     2.  The execution, delivery and performance by the
Borrower of the Agreement and each Note are within the
Borrower's corporate power, have been duly authorized by all
necessary corporate action, require no action by or in
respect of, or filing with, any governmental body, agency or
official and do not contravene, or constitute a default
under, any provision of applicable law or regulation or of
the Restated Certificate of Incorporation or by-laws of the
Borrower or of any agreement, judgment, injunction, order,
decree or other instrument binding upon the Borrower or
result in the creation or imposition of any Lien on any
asset of the Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries.

     3.  The Agreement constitutes a valid and binding
agreement of the Borrower and each Note constitutes a valid
and binding obligation of the Borrower, in each case
enforceable in accordance with its terms, except as the same
may be limited by bankruptcy, insolvency or similar laws
affecting creditors' rights generally and by general
principles of equity.

     4.  There is no action, suit or proceeding pending
against, or to the best of my knowledge threatened against
or affecting the Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries before
any court or arbitrator or any governmental body, agency or
official, in which there is a reasonable possibility of an
adverse decision which could materially adversely affect the
business, consolidated financial position or consolidated
results of operations of the Borrower and its Consolidated
Subsidiaries or which in any manner draws into question the
validity of the Agreement or each Note.

     5.  I have no reason to believe that each of the
Borrower's Subsidiaries is not a corporation duly
incorporated, validly existing and in good standing under
the laws of its jurisdiction of incorporation, or that each
does not have all corporate powers and all material
governmental licenses, authorizations, consents and
approvals required to carry on its business as now
conducted.

                              Very truly yours,

                                            EXHIBIT C

                         OPINION OF
            DAVIS POLK & WARDWELL, SPECIAL COUNSEL
                        FOR THE AGENT

                                          March 30, 1995

To the Banks and the Agent
     Referred to Below
c/o Morgan Guaranty Trust Company
     of New York, as Agent
60 Wall Street
New York, New York  10260-0060

Dear Sirs:

     We have participated in the preparation of the Credit
Agreement (the "Credit Agreement") dated as of March 30,
1995 among John Wiley & Sons, Inc., a New York corporation
(the "Borrower"), the banks listed on the signature pages
thereof (the "Banks") and Morgan Guaranty Trust Company of
New York, as Agent (the "Agent"), and have acted as special
counsel for the Agent for the purpose of rendering this
opinion pursuant to Section 3.01(d) of the Credit Agreement.
Terms defined in the Credit Agreement are used herein as
therein defined.

     We have examined originals or copies, certified or
otherwise identified to our satisfaction, of such documents,
corporate records, certificates of public officials and
other instruments and have conducted such other
investigations of fact and law as we have deemed necessary
or advisable for purposes of this opinion.

     Upon the basis of the foregoing, we are of the opinion
that:

     1.  The execution, delivery and performance by the
Borrower of the Credit Agreement and each Note are within
the Borrower's corporate powers and have been duly
authorized by all necessary corporate action.

     2.  The Credit Agreement constitutes a valid and
binding agreement of the Borrower and each Note constitutes

<PAGE>

a valid and binding obligation of the Borrower, in each case
enforceable in accordance with its terms, except as the same
may be limited by bankruptcy, insolvency or similar laws
affecting creditors' rights generally and by general
principles of equity.

     We are members of the Bar of the State of New York and
the foregoing opinion is limited to the laws of the State of
New York and the federal laws of the United States of
America.  In giving the foregoing opinion, we express no
opinion as to the effect (if any) of any law of any
jurisdiction (except the State of New York) in which any
Bank is located which limits the rate of interest that such
Bank may charge or collect.

     This opinion is rendered solely to you in connection
with the above matter.  This opinion may not be relied upon
by you for any other purpose or relied upon by any other
person without our prior written consent.

     Very truly yours,

  1. Financial goals for the company are determined near the
      beginning of the plan year by the President and CEO.  The
      President and CEO's goals are reviewed and approved by the
      Finance Committee of the Board and ECDC, and approved by the
      Board.
      
  2. Financial goals are set for the company as a whole and for each
      division and may be revised in the interim, as appropriate.  The
      participant will be given specific financial goals, based on an
      appropriate mix of company and/or division objectives.
      
  3. Financial goals include defining levels of performance
      (threshold, target and outstanding) and the measures of each.

B.   Strategic Milestones
  1. Strategic milestones are non-financial individual objectives
      over which the participant has a large measure of control, which
      lead to, or are expected to lead to improved performance for the
      company in the future.  Strategic milestones are determined near
      the beginning of the plan year by the participant, and approved
      by the participant's manager, if the President and CEO is not
      the participant's manager.
      
  2. The strategic milestones for the President and CEO are reviewed
      and approved by the Executive and Policy Committee of the Board
      and by the Board.
      
  3. The strategic milestones for the President and CEO should be
      appropriately reflected in those of all other employees at all
      levels.  Each participant collaborates with his/her manager in
      setting strategic milestones.  The strategic milestones may be
      revised in the interim, as appropriate.
                           -3-
<PAGE>
      
  4. The determination of strategic milestones includes defining a
      target level of performance and the measure of such, and may
      include defining threshold and outstanding levels of performance
      and the measures of such.
  
                      V.  PERFORMANCE EVALUATION
A. Financial Results
   1. Actual financial results achieved by the company and by each
       group and division will be calculated at the end of the plan
       year, subject to adjustment for audited results, and will be
       compared with previously set financial goals.
       
   2. Actual financial results will be reviewed by the participant's
       manager and the President and CEO and a payout factor
       determined.  The payout factor is based on a judgment of the
       relative importance of  financial results and the achievement
       compared to the financial goals.  This payout factor is subject
       to the review and approval of the President and CEO.  The ECDC
       will evaluate the President and CEO's financial results and
       will recommend to the Board his/her financial results payout
       factor.

B. Strategic Milestones
   1. Achievement of a participant's strategic milestones will be
       determined at the end of the plan year by comparing results
       achieved to previously set objectives.
       
   2. Each participant's manager will recommend a payout factor for
       achievement of all strategic milestones compared with the
       previously set objectives.  In determining the payout factor,
       the overall performance on all strategic milestones will be
       considered.  This payout factor is subject to the review and
       approval of the President and CEO, the ECDC and the Board.  The
       ECDC will recommend to the Board for approval the payout factor
       for the President and CEO's achievement of his/her strategic
       milestones based on the Executive and Policy Committee of the
       Board's evaluation of his/her achievement compared with the
       previously set objectives.
       
C. Award Determination
   1. Financial goals, established for each participant, may include
       one or more organizational level's financial goals (e.g.
       company and division), and one or more financial goal for a
       particular organizational unit.  At least threshold
       performance, in aggregate, of a participant's particular
       organizational level is necessary for the participant to
       receive a payout for the particular organizational level.
       However, once the overall threshold is achieved, the non-
       achievement of any one particular financial goal's target
       objective does not preclude a payout for all the participant's
       financial goals.
       
   2. At least threshold performance of financial goals is required
       of the participant's organizational level for a payout of
       strategic milestones to be made.  If the participant is
       measured against more than one organizational level, at least
       threshold performance of financial goals, is required of the
                                 -4-
<PAGE>

       organizational level which has the greatest percent weighting
       of the organizational levels' target incentive amount for a
       payout of strategic milestones to be made.  If the percent
       weighting of the target incentive amount is equal for all the
       organizational levels against which the participant is
       measured, then at least threshold performance of financial
       goals is required of all the participant's organizational
       levels for a payout of strategic milestones to be made.
       
   3. Payout eligibility will be determined by calculating the amount
       for achievement of financial goals and strategic milestones and
       adding the two together, as follows:
   
                                   
                  EAIP PAYOUT ELIGIBILITY CALCULATION

               Base Salary  X  Target Incentive Percent
                                   
        X  Weighting of Strategic Milestones  X  Payout Factor
                                   
              =  Strategic Milestones Payout Eligibility
                                   
                        EAIP PAYOUT ELIGIBILITY
                                   
 Financial Goals Payout Amount  +  Strategic Milestones Payout Amount
                                   
                      =  EAIP Payout Eligibility
                                   
   
   4. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary, the maximum payout,
       if any, a participant may receive is 150% of the target
       incentive amount.
       
   5. The foregoing EAIP payout eligibility calculation is intended
       to set forth general guidelines on how awards are to be
       determined.  The purpose of this plan is to motivate the
       participant to perform in an outstanding manner.  The President
       and CEO has discretion under this plan to take into
       consideration the contribution of the participant, the
       participant's management of his/her organizational unit and
       other relevant factors, positive or negative, which impact the
       company's, the participant's organizational unit(s), and the
       participant's performance overall in determining whether to
       recommend granting or denying an award, and the amount of the
       award, if any.  If the participant is the President and CEO,
       such discretion is to be exercised by the ECDC and the Board.

                             VI.  PAYOUTS
Payouts will be made within 90 days after the end of the plan year and
will be based on audited financial results.

                         VII.  STATUS CHANGES
A. In the event of a participant's death, disability, retirement or
   leave of absence prior to payout from the plan, the payout, if
   any, will be determined by the President and CEO in his/her sole
   discretion, subject to any approval of the ECDC in its sole
   discretion, subject to any required Board approvals.  If  the
   participant is the President and CEO, such approval is required by
   the Board, in its sole discretion.

B. A participant who resigns, or whose employment is terminated by
   the company, with or without cause, before payout from the plan is
   distributed, will not receive a payout.  Exception to this
   provision shall be made only with the approval of the ECDC, in its
   sole discretion, subject to any required Board approvals.  If the
   participant is the President and CEO, such approval is required by
   the Board in its sole discretion.

C. A participant who transfers between divisions of the company, will
   have his/her payout prorated to the nearest fiscal quarter for the
   time spent in each division, based on the achievement of financial
   goals and strategic milestones established for the position in
   each division, and based upon a judgment of the participant's
   contribution to the achievement of goals in each position,
   including interim revisions, if appropriate.

D. A participant who is appointed to a position with a different
   target incentive percent will have his/her payout prorated to the
   nearest fiscal quarter for the time spent in each position, based
   on the achievement of financial goals and strategic milestones
   established for each position.

E. A participant who is hired or promoted into an eligible position
   during the plan year may receive a prorated payout as determined
   by the President and CEO, in his/her sole discretion, subject to
   the approval of the ECDC.

                VIII.  ADMINISTRATION AND OTHER MATTERS
A. The plan is effective for the plan year.  It will terminate,
   subject to payout, if any, in accordance with and subject to the
   provisions of this plan unless renewed by the company in writing
   in its sole discretion.

B. This plan will be administered by the President and CEO, who will
   have authority to interpret and administer this plan, including,
   without limitation, all questions regarding eligibility and status
   of the participant, subject to the approval of the ECDC required
   under this plan or the by-laws of the company.

C. This plan may be withdrawn, amended or modified at any time, and
   for any reason, in writing, in the company's sole discretion.

D. The determination of an award and payout under this plan, if any,
   is subject to the approval of the President and CEO, the ECDC, and
   the Board in their sole discretion.  This plan does not confer
   upon any participant the right to receive any payout, or payment
   of any kind whatsoever.
                                   -6-

E. No participant shall have any vested rights under this plan.  This
   plan does not constitute a contract.

                         II.  PLAN OBJECTIVES
The purpose of this plan is to enable the company to reinforce and
sustain a culture devoted to excellent performance, emphasize long
term financial performance at the corporate and division levels,
reward significant contributions to the success of the company,
attract and retain highly qualified executives, and provide an
opportunity for each participant to acquire equity in the company.

                           III.  ELIGIBILITY
The participant is selected by the ECDC in its sole discretion, from
among those employees in key management positions deemed able to make
the most significant contributions to the growth and profitability of
the company.  An employee must be a participant of the FY 1996
Executive Annual Incentive Plan to be eligible to participate in this
plan.  The President and CEO of the company is a participant.
                                   
                            IV.  INCENTIVE
A.The participant's target incentive is determined based on the
  participant's position in the company and the contributions the
  position is deemed able to make in achieving the cumulative
  financial goals of the company.

B.The participant's target incentive is recommended by the President
  and CEO to the ECDC for its and the Board's approval.  In the case
  of the President and CEO, the target incentive is recommended by
  the ECDC for the Board's approval.

C.The incentive's two components may be restricted stock, if
  authorized by the ECDC, and cash.

              V.  PERFORMANCE MEASUREMENT AND OBJECTIVES
A. The objectives for the cumulative financial goals are recommended
   by the ECDC with the advice of the Finance Committee to the Board
   for its approval.  The cumulative financial goals performance
   objectives are set at a level which are challenging and
   achievable.

B. Cumulative financial goals established for each participant may
   include one or more organizational level's financial goals (e.g.
   company and division), and one or more financial goals for a
   particular organizational unit (e.g. cash flow, income, ROE and
                              -4-
<PAGE>

   ROI).  The weighting of and between the two organizational levels'
   cumulative financial goals may vary, depending upon the
   participant's position.  Weighting of the participant's cumulative
   financial goals is recommended by the President and CEO to the
   ECDC.  In the case of the President and CEO, the cumulative
   financial goals are company net income, cash flow, ROE and ROI.

C. Threshold, target and outstanding performance levels for the
   cumulative financial goals are recommended by the President and
   CEO for approval by the ECDC, the Finance Committee of the Board
   and the Board.

                      VI.  PERFORMANCE EVALUATION
A. Cumulative Financial Results
   1. Actual cumulative financial results achieved by the company and
       by each division will be calculated at the end of the plan
       cycle, subject to adjustment for audited results, and will be
       compared with the previously set cumulative financial goals.
       
   2. The cumulative financial results will be reviewed by the
       President and CEO to determine proposed payout factors for the
       company and for the divisions.
       
   3. The President and CEO will provide to the ECDC a view of the
       company's achievement of its cumulative financial goals, as
       well as divisional achievement of like objectives, if any, and
       will recommend payout factors to be used for the company and
       divisional objectives.

B. Award Determination
   1. At least threshold performance, in aggregate, of a
       participant's particular organizational level's objectives is
       necessary for the participant to receive a payout for the
       particular organizational level.  However, once the overall
       threshold is achieved, the non-achievement of any one
       particular cumulative financial goal's target objective does
       not preclude a payout.
   
   2. The determination of the performance level achievement
       (threshold, target and outstanding, or points in between) for
       each organizational level's cumulative financial goals will be
       made independent of any other organizational level's cumulative
       financial goals a participant may have.
       
   3. If the participant has more than one organizational level's
       cumulative financial goals, the non-achievement of a threshold
       performance level of one organizational level's cumulative
       financial goals does not preclude a payout for the other
       organizational level's cumulative financial goals.
       
   4. The following details the effect of the cumulative financial
       results performance levels on a participant's payout amount.
       The actual payout factors will be in the sole judgment and
       discretion of the ECDC, taking into account the following
       guidelines:
   
       a. For below threshold performance in aggregate, the payout
           amount is zero.
           
       b. For company threshold performance in aggregate, 25% of the
           target incentive may be recommended.  For divisional
           threshold performance in aggregate, 50% of the target
           incentive may be recommended
                                -5-
<PAGE>

       c. For between company threshold and target performance in
           aggregate, at minimum 25% of the target incentive and up to
           100% of the target incentive may be recommended.  For
           between divisional threshold and target performance in
           aggregate, at minimum 50% of the target incentive and up to
           100% of the target incentive may be recommended.
           
       d. For target performance in aggregate, 100% of the target
           incentive may be recommended.
           
       e. For between target and outstanding performance in
           aggregate, at minimum 100% of the target incentive and up
           to 150% of the target incentive may be recommended.
           
       f. For outstanding performance in aggregate, 150% of the
           target incentive may be recommended.
           
   5. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary, the maximum payout
       amount, if any, a participant may receive is 150% of the target
       incentive.

                              VII PAYOUTS
                                   
A.   The cash payout amount will be based on the following formula:

     Target Incentive  x  Corporate Weighting  x  Payout Factor  =
                      Corporate Incentive Payout
                                   
Target Incentive  x  Divisional Weighting  x  Divisional Payout Factor
                    =  Divisional Incentive Payout
                                   
   Corporate Incentive Payout + (if applicable) Divisional Incentive
  Payout - (Plan End Adjusted Restricted Stock Award x Stock Price at
             Beginning of Plan Cycle) = Cash Payout Amount

Note:  See Section VIII for information regarding the proportion of
the payout amount which is paid in cash and in restricted stock.

B. The restricted stock portion of the payout amount, if any, will be
   made as set forth in Section VIII below.  The determination by the
   ECDC of plan end adjusted restricted stock shall constitute payout
   of this portion of the award.

C.  The cash payout, if any, of the payout amount will be made within
   90 days after the end of the plan cycle.

D.  In the event of a participant's death, permanent disability,
   retirement or leave of absence prior to payout from this plan,
   restricted stock awarded at the beginning of the plan cycle, if
   any, is forfeited, and the payout amount, if any, will be
   determined by the ECDC in its sole discretion.

E.  A participant who resigns, or whose employment is terminated by
   the company, with or without cause, prior to payout from this
   plan, is not eligible for a payout amount and shall forfeit any
   restricted stock awarded at the beginning of the plan cycle.
                              -6-
<PAGE>
   
               VIII.  RESTRICTED STOCK AWARD PROVISIONS
A. Since one of the objectives of this plan is to provide the
   participant with an equity stake in the company and align
   management and shareholder interests, it is intended that a
   portion of the target incentive, will be awarded in equity
   (restricted stock and stock options) and the remaining portion
   will be awarded in cash.  At the beginning of the plan cycle, the
   ECDC will determine the proportion of the target incentive that
   will be allocated between restricted stock, and cash.  While it is
   intended that such proportions will be maintained, the actual
   proportions may be adjusted by the ECDC at the end of the plan
   cycle, in its sole discretion.

B. Restricted stock, if any, shall be awarded at the beginning of the
   plan cycle, after the June, 1995 ECDC meeting.  The amount of
   restricted stock awarded shall be based on the proportion of the
   target incentive allocated to restricted stock, as determined by
   the ECDC.  The value of each share will be determined based on the
   stock closing sale price, as reported by NASDAQ, on the date the
   ECDC acts at the beginning of the plan cycle (June 15, 1995).  In
   the event the stock is not traded on June 15, 1995 or the date the
   ECDC acts, whichever is later, the closing sales price shall be
   the price of the stock on the next day after June 15, 1995 or the
   date the ECDC acts on which the stock trades.  The restricted
   stock awarded at the beginning of the plan cycle also is subject
   to adjustment at the end of the plan cycle as set forth in
   Sections VIII (C) and (D) below.  Restricted stock, if any, shall
   be awarded pursuant to the shareholder plan, as approved by the
   ECDC. In addition to the terms and conditions set forth in the
   shareholder plan and Section VII (D) and (E) above, the following
   conditions shall apply:

   1.   The participant shall have the right to receive dividends or
        other distributions with respect to restricted stock shares
        received at the beginning of the plan cycle and shall have
        the right to vote such shares, however the restricted stock
        may not be sold or transferred until all restrictions lapse.
        Restricted stock shall be legended and held by the Company.

   2.   Withholding taxes relating to restricted stock awarded may be
        satisfied by surrendering shares to the company, in lieu of
        cash, upon lapse of the restriction.

   3.   The restricted period for restricted stock awarded shall be
        as follows:  subject to continued employment except as
        otherwise set forth in the shareholder plan or Sections VII
        and VIII of this plan, the lapse of restrictions on one-half
        of the restricted stock awarded will occur on the first
        anniversary (April 30, 1999) of the plan end date at which
        time the participant will receive a new stock certificate in
        a number of shares equal to one-half of the restricted stock
        awarded with the restrictive legend deleted, and the lapse of
        restrictions on the remaining half will occur on the second
        anniversary (April 30, 2000) of the plan end date at which
        time the participant will receive a new stock certificate in
        a number of shares equal to the remaining half with the
        restrictive legend deleted.
   
   4.   If the participant dies or becomes permanently disabled
        during the restricted period, the restrictions on the
        restricted stock will lapse on the date of such event.
                              -7-
<PAGE>

   5.   If the participant retires during the restricted period at or
        after his/her normal retirement date, the restrictions on the
        restricted stock will lapse on the date of such event.
   
   6.   If the participant takes early retirement during the
        restricted period, the restrictions on the restricted stock
        will not lapse until the restricted period expires.  If the
        participant dies between the time the participant takes early
        retirement and the end of the restricted period (April 30,
        2000), the lapse of restrictions on the restricted stock will
        occur on the date of such event.

   7.   The restricted stock may be adjusted by the ECDC for any
        change in the capital stock of the company, as provided in
        Section II of the shareholder plan and is in all respects
        subject to the provisions of that plan.

  8.    In the event of a change of control, as defined in the
        shareholder plan, all shares of restricted stock which would
        otherwise remain subject to restrictions under the plan shall
        be free of such restrictions.

C. The number of shares of restricted stock awarded at the beginning
   of the plan cycle, may be adjusted at the end of the plan cycle
   for the following reasons:  (1) if the proportion of the target
   incentive award is restricted stock is adjusted at plan year end
   by the ECDC as set forth in Section VIII (A) and/or (2) when the
   payout factor is adjusted at plan year end based on actual
   achievement of target objectives.

D. An adjustment to the restricted stock will be determined as
   follows:  The final proportion (%) of restricted stock established
   by the ECDC at the end of the plan cycle times (x) the payout
   amount equals (=) that part of the payout amount to be awarded in
   restricted stock.  The result of this calculation will be divided
   by the stock price set at the beginning of the plan cycle, as
   previously defined, to give the number of shares for the plan end
   adjusted restricted stock award.  The result of this calculation
   will be compared to the restricted stock awarded at the beginning
   of the plan cycle, and the appropriate amount of restricted stock
   will be awarded or forfeited, as required, to bring the restricted
   stock award to the number of shares designated as the plan end
   adjusted stock award.

                           IX.  STOCK OPTION
The participant may be granted a stock option pursuant to the
shareholder plan at the beginning of the plan cycle, representing
another incentive vehicle by which the participant is able to share in
the equity growth of the company.  The number of shares in the stock
option granted to a participant under this plan is based on a set of
variables and assumptions, applied consistently to all participants,
regarding the monetary value a participant might receive upon exercise
of the stock option.  The terms and conditions of the award of the
stock option are contained in the shareholder plan and in the stock
option award.  Withholding taxes relating to the gain realized on the
exercise of an option may be satisfied by surrendering to the company
the equivalent value of the taxes, or a portion thereof, in option
shares in lieu of cash.

                 X.  ADMINISTRATION AND OTHER MATTERS
A.This plan will be administered by the ECDC, who will have authority
  in its sole discretion to interpret and administer this plan,
  including, without limitation, all questions regarding eligibility
                                  -8-
<PAGE>

  and status of any participant, and no participant shall have any
  right to receive any restricted stock or payment of any kind
  whatsoever, except as determined by the ECDC hereunder.

B.The company will have no obligation to reserve or otherwise fund in
  advance any amount which may become payable under the plan.

C.Restricted stock awarded and cash paid out under this plan shall
  not be considered as compensation for purposes of defining
  compensation for retirement, savings or supplemental executive
  retirement plans, or similar type plans.

D.This plan may not be modified or amended except with the approval
  of the ECDC.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, Section VIII B (8)
  shall not be amended.

E.In the event of a conflict between the provisions of this plan and
  the provisions of the shareholder plan, the latter shall apply.

                                     Exhibit 10.14

     1994 SENIOR EXECUTIVE EMPLOYMENT AGREEMENT

     AGREEMENT made as of the 1st day of
July,  1994, as  amended and restated as of the 29th
day of March, 1995, by  and  between  John  Wiley &
Sons,  Inc.,  a  New  York corporation,  with offices
at 605 Third Avenue,  New  York, New   York       10158
(hereinafter  referred   to   as   the
"Corporation"), and Charles R. Ellis presently residing
at 300  East  54th Street, Apartment 34K, New York,
New  York 10022 (hereinafter referred to as the
"Executive").

               W I T N E S S E T H :

        Executive is presently employed as
President and Chief Executive   Officer  of   the
Corporation.  The Corporation  and Executive entered
into an Agreement  dated as  of  July  1, 1994 (the
"Original Agreement")  regarding Executive's employment
with   the     Corporation.        The Corporation  and
Executive desire to amend and restate  the Original
Agreement  and  to enter  into  an  agreement  of
employment  on  the  terms and subject  to  the
conditions hereinafter set forth.
                 

<PAGE>

       NOW THEREFORE, the parties agree as follows:
       1.      Employment.
    
       1.1     The Corporation hereby employs Executive
as President and Chief Executive Officer of the
Corporation.
    
       1.2     Executive hereby accepts such employment
and shall  devote his full business time, attention,
knowledge and  skills faithfully, diligently and to the
best  of  his ability to the performance of his duties.
Executive  shall do  such traveling as may be
reasonably required of him  in the  performance of his
duties.  Executive shall be subject to  and  shall
observe and carry out such reasonable rules,
regulations,    policies,   directions   and
restrictions consistent with the duties to be performed
by him hereunder as the Corporation shall from time to
time establish.

       1.3     If at any time during the term of
employment the Board of Directors of the Corporation
shall, without his consent, and other than for cause or
on account of death, disability or retirement, fail to
re-elect Executive as President and Chief Executive
Officer or shall remove him from such office, Executive
shall have the right, exercisable by written notice to
the Corporation within ten business days after the
occurrence of such failure to re-elect or removal, to
terminate his services hereunder, effective as of the
last day of the month of receipt by the Corporation of
any such written notice, and Executive shall have no
further obligation under this Agreement. Termination of
Executive's services under this Section shall be
treated as a termination of employment by the
Corporation other than for cause and shall be governed
by the provisions of Section 6.2 of this Agreement.
                  -2-
<PAGE>

       1.4     Executive shall not be entitled to
compensation other than the compensation provided for
(or otherwise referred to) in this Agreement for any
services he may render as a director or officer of any
of the Corporation's subsidiaries.

       1.5     Executive shall not without the prior
written approval of the Corporation accept employment
or compensation from or perform services of any nature
for any business enterprise other than the Corporation
or any of its subsidiaries or joint-venture entities.

       1.6     Executive shall not without the prior
written approval of the Corporation invest in any
business enterprise -

       1.6.1   if such enterprise engages in or
involves a "Restricted  Business" as that term is hereinafter
defined in Section 8.1;

       1.6.2   if such investment interferes with the
performance of Executive's duties hereunder; or
                    -3-
<PAGE>

       1.6.3   if such investment would violate the
Corporation's announced business policy with respect to
employee interests in suppliers of goods or services to
the Corporation or any of its subsidiaries.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, Executive may invest
in securities of any company if such securities are
listed for trading  on  a  national stock exchange or
traded  on  the over-the-counter market and Executive's
investment  therein represents  less than one percent
(1%) of the total  number of outstanding shares of the
class of shares or outstanding principal amount of the
class of other securities  of  such company, as the
case may be.

       1.7     Executive shall not without the prior
written approval of the Corporation serve on the board
of directors of  any  business enterprise other than
the Corporation  or any of its subsidiaries.

       2.      Term.

       2.1     Executive's term of employment hereunder
shall commence as of July 1, 1994 and shall continue
through July 20,  1998, unless sooner terminated in
accordance with this Agreement,  and thereafter as
herein provided.  Executive's term   of  employment
shall  automatically  renew  for   a subsequent  two
year term, beginning  on  July  21,  1998, subject to
the terms of this Agreement, unless either party gives
written  notice  90  days  or  more  prior  to   the
expiration of the then existing term of his or its
decision not  to  renew.   Failure  by  the
Corporation  to  renew, although not a termination by
the Corporation without cause or  for  cause, shall for
purposes of the benefits intended to  be  provided  to
Executive  (and  the  obligations  of Executive  under
Section 6.5) be deemed  to  constitute  a termination
without cause.
                       -4-
<PAGE>

       3.      Compensation.

       3.1     As compensation for his services
hereunder, the Corporation shall pay Executive a base salary at  the
rate of  three  hundred seventy thousand ($370,000)
Dollars  per annum, subject to increase as hereinbelow
provided, payable in equal installments no less
frequently than monthly.

       3.2       Executive shall be eligible to participate
in all of the Corporation's
executive compensation plans in which any senior vice
president is eligible to participate, including but not
limited to the Executive Annual Incentive Plan
("EAIP"), the Executive Long Term Incentive Plan
("ELTIP"), or equivalents, for so long as such plans
remain in effect and shall also be entitled to all of
his other presently existing employment benefits and
perquisites or equivalents.

       3.3       Executive's compensation shall be reviewed
periodically in accordance with procedures and policies
established by the Corporation for salary review of its
officers.
                 -5-
<PAGE>

       3.4     To the extent coverage is not
duplicative of that provided under an executive
compensation plan in which Executive is eligible to
participate, Executive shall be included to the extent
eligible under any and all plans providing benefits
generally for the Corporation's employees, including,
but not limited to, pension, group life insurance,
hospitalization, medical and disability plans.  The
Corporation shall not, however, be under any obligation
to continue the existence of any executive compensation
or other employee benefit plan referred to in Section
3.2 or this Section 3.4.

       3.5     The Executive Compensation and
Development Committee (the "Committee") intends, at a
meeting of the Committee to be held before the end of
June 1995, to grant to Executive under the 1991 Key
Employee Stock Plan 15,000 post 7/6/94 split shares of
Class A Common Stock of the Corporation, par value $1
per share ("Common Stock"), pursuant to substantially
the same terms and subject to substantially the same
conditions and restrictions as the restricted stock
awarded to Executive by the Corporation on June 23,
1994, as the same may be amended from time to time;
provided, however, that no "Transfer Restriction" (as
defined in the Restricted Stock Award Agreement, dated
as of June 23, 1994, between the Corporation and
Executive) shall be placed on the restricted stock
granted in 1995. Upon the retirement of Executive with
the consent and approval of the Board of Directors of
the Corporation, all restrictions with respect to all
restricted stock granted to Executive shall lapse.

       3.6     Subject to the next sentence of this
Section 3.6, (i) should the 1995 restricted stock award
contemplated by Section 3.5 not be timely granted, or
should any such award be altered or impaired
thereafter, other than as contemplated by the 1991 Key
Employee Stock Plan or (ii) should the Corporation
cease to provide incentive compensation plans in which
Executive is eligible to participate, substantially
similar to those described in Section 3.2 above, and of
a value to Executive substantially similar to that of
the present plans, Executive shall have the right to
terminate his services hereunder, exercisable by
written notice to the Corporation within ten business
days after (i) the end of June 1995, or (ii) the
cessation of such plans, as applicable, effective as of
the last day of the month of receipt by the Corporation
of any such notice, and Executive shall have no further
obligation of any kind under or arising out of this
Agreement.  Should a circumstance or event not within
the reasonable contemplation of the parties at the date
hereof arise on or before the date when the Committee
meets to award grants of the kind contemplated by
Section 3.5 that makes it inadvisable or undesirable in
the reasonable judgment of the Committee to grant to
Executive the awards contemplated by that Section, and
should the Committee and/or the Board of Directors of
the Corporation (as may be required) on or about such
date, because of such intervening circumstance or
event, instead bestow upon Executive benefits of
reasonably equivalent value and having comparable
vesting dates, Executive shall thereupon forego his
right of termination under the preceding sentence.
Termination of Executive's services under this Section
3.6 shall be treated as a termination of employment by
the Corporation other than for cause and shall be
governed by the provisions of Section 6.2.

       4.      Vacation.

               Executive shall be entitled to four
weeks  of paid vacation, or such greater  amount,  if
any,  as  provided in the policies of the Corporation
then applicable  to  Executive, each calendar  year
during  the period  of his employment hereunder, to be
taken  at  times mutually agreeable to Executive and
the Corporation.
                     -6-
<PAGE>

       5.      Change of Position

       5.1     At any time during the term of this
Agreement, or upon  completion  of Executive's first
term  of  employment hereunder  on  July 20, 1998,
Executive may, upon  90  days written  notice to the
Corporation, request to be  employed by the Corporation
(x) in a senior management position with less
responsibility  than President  and  Chief  Executive
Officer  for  a period of 24 months or (y) as  an
internal consultant  to management and/or the Board of
Directors  of the  Corporation (provided, that under
such consultancy the knowledge,  skills  and experience
of  Executive  would  be generally  available and
accessible to the  Corporation  in such  a  manner  as
would continue to qualify  him  as  an employee  of
the Corporation) for a period  of  24  months (either
(x)  or  (y),  a "Change of  Position"),  and  the
Corporation shall honor such request.  In the  event
of  a Change  of Position, the obligations of the
Corporation  to Executive shall be limited to the
following:

       5.1.1   Salary accrued to the effective date of
such Change of Position;

       5.1.2   Continuation of base salary at the per
annum rate then in effect, for a period of 24 months
from the effective date of such Change of Position
(hereinafter the "Change Period"); and
                  -7-
<PAGE>

       5.1.3   Coverage during such Change Period under
the employee benefit plans referred to in Section 3.4
or provisions for comparable benefits outside such
plans. Executive shall have no right to  continued
employment  with the Corporation beyond the Change
Period. The  Board  of  Directors  is not precluded
from,  in  its discretion, awarding Executive
supplemental bonus compensation based on the
contributions of Executive to the Corporation  and the
performance of the Corporation  during the  Change
Period.   Notwithstanding the  foregoing,  the
obligations  of  the  Corporation to Executive  under
this Section  5.1 shall not extend beyond July 20, 2000
without the consent of the Board of Directors of the
Corporation.

       6.      Termination of Employment By
Corporation.

       6.1     The Corporation may terminate
Executive's employment hereunder at any time for cause
without  further obligation  or  liability except as
hereinbelow  stated  in this Section 6.1.  For purposes
of this Agreement, the term "cause" shall be limited to
the following grounds:

       6.1.1   Executive's refusal to substantially
perform his  duties  or otherwise fulfill his material
obligations under  this  Agreement (for reasons  other

       6.1.2   Conviction of a felony crime;

       6.1.3   Perpetration of a fraud against the
Corporation or misappropriation of the Corporation's
property;

       6.1.4   Habitual intoxication or illegal use of
habit forming substances; or

       6.1.5   Knowingly making a material false

management regarding the affairs of the Corporation.

  In the event Executive's employment is terminated for
cause,  no  further payments of salary or benefits  of
any kind or nature (except to the extent accrued to the
date of termination)  shall  be  paid to Executive,
and  Executive shall  have no further claim against the
Corporation  under the  terms of this Agreement or
otherwise relating  to  his employment.

       6.2     Corporation may terminate Executive's
employment hereunder at any time without cause.  In the
event of  such termination the obligations of the
Corporation to Executive shall be limited to the
following:

       6.2.1   Salary accrued to the effective date of
such termination;
                     -9-
<PAGE>

       6.2.2   Continuation of base salary at the per
annum rate then in effect, until July 20, 1998, and for
a period of 24 months thereafter (hereinafter the
"Severance Period");

       6.2.3   The "target incentive amount" under any
executive annual incentive plan established by the
Corporation for a fiscal year ending during the
Severance Period, and the same "target incentive
amount" for any such executive annual incentive plan,
pro-rated to the end of the Severance Period, for a
fiscal year commencing during but ending after the
Severance Period, or the equivalent under any bonus or
variable compensation plan which may hereafter be
adopted by the Corporation in lieu of such executive
annual incentive plan;

       6.2.4   The value of the "payout amount," in
cash, for any executive long term incentive plan
established by the Corporation, the plan cycle of which
ends within 12 months after the effective date of
termination, pro-rated to the date of termination;

       6.2.5   Lapse of restrictions on any outstanding
restricted stock awards granted under any executive
long term incentive plan established by the
Corporation, but not vested on the effective date of
termination, or at the Corporation's option, the cash
value of the restricted stock forfeited under such
awards based on "fair market value" on the effective
date of termination; and
                        -10-
<PAGE>

       6.2.6   Coverage during such Severance Period
under the following employee benefit plans or
provisions for comparable benefits outside such plans,
but only to the extent comparable coverage is not
provided by any new employer:  (1) Group Health
Insurance Program; (2) Long-Term Disability Plan (as
provided under such Plan, the Executive shall be
required to pay the premium); (3) Group Life and
Accidental Death and Dismemberment Insurance (at the
levels in effect at the date of termination of
employment, taking into account any waiver of coverage
under the Corporation's Supplemental Executive
Retirement Program).

  For purposes of Section 6.2.5, the "fair market
value" shall be the mean between the bid and  asked
prices at which the Common Stock is quoted in the over-
thecounter  market  on  the effective date of
termination  as reported  by NASDAQ or any successor
thereto.  If  no  such quotations  are  available on
such date,  the  most  recent date,  within a
reasonable time, upon which such quotations
are  available shall be used.  If at any time Common
Stock shall be listed on a national securities
exchange, the mean between  the highest and lowest
prices at which the  Common Stock  is  traded on such
exchange on such  date  shall  be used.   If  there is
no sale of the Common  Stock  on  such
exchange  on such date, the mean between the bid and
asked prices on such exchange at the close of the
market on  such date  shall  be deemed to be the fair
market value  of  the Common Stock.
                   - 11-
<PAGE>

       Executive   shall  not  be   required      to
seek other employment during such Severance Period, but
in the  event Executive renders personal services
during  such period  to  any person or firm other than
the  Corporation, whether  as  an  employee, a partner
or as a  self-employed individual  and earns income
(whether or not then  payable) attributable  to the
performance of such personal  services during either
the 12 month period commencing on the date of
termination of employment or the next succeeding  12
month period  in excess of $75,000 per such 12 month
period,  (i) Executive shall notify the Corporation, in
accordance  with Section 10.3 hereof, within 15 days of
the commencement  of such  employment, and (ii) the
amount of salary  which  the Corporation  would
otherwise be required to  pay  Executive during  such
12 month period shall be reduced  dollar  for dollar
by  such  excess  amount.   If  as  a  result of
Executive's  accruing  such  income,  the  Corporation
has overpaid Executive, Executive shall promptly
reimburse  the Corporation for the amount of such
overpayment.
                     -12-
<PAGE>

       6.3     Executive agrees that the payments
described in Section  6.2  shall  be full and adequate
compensation  to Executive for all damages he may
suffer as a result of  the termination of his
employment pursuant to Section 6.2,  and hereby waives
and releases the Corporation from any and all
obligations or liabilities to Executive arising from or
in connection with Executive's employment with the
Corporation or  the  termination  of his employment
including,  without limitation, all rights and claims
Executive may have  under the  Corporation's severance
policy and federal,  state  or local  statutes,
regulations or ordinances  or  under  any common law
principles of breach of contract or the covenant of
good  faith  and  fair  dealing,  defamation,  wrongful
discharge, intentional infliction of emotional distress
or promissory estoppel; provided, however, that any
rights and benefits  Executive  may have under the
employment  benefit plans  and programs of the
Corporation, including,  without limitation,   the
Corporation's  Supplemental   Executive
Retirement          Program, in which Executive is  a
participant, shall  be  determined  in accordance  with
the  terms  and provisions of such plans and
provisions.

       6.4     If Executive voluntarily resigns from
all employment with the Corporation, the Corporation
shall have no further obligation to Executive except
for salary accrued to the effective date of such
resignation.
                    -13-
<PAGE>

       6.5     In the event the Corporation terminates
Executive's employment, whether with or without cause,
or in the event of Executive's voluntary resignation
from all employment with the Corporation, Executive if
so requested by the Corporation shall assist in the
orderly transfer of authority and responsibility to his
successor.

       7.      Death or Disability.

       7.1     In the event of the death of Executive
during the term  of  employment  under this Agreement
or  during  the period  when  payments are being made
pursuant  to  Section 6.2.2,  this  Agreement shall
terminate and all obligations to  Executive  shall
cease as of the date of  death  except that  the
Corporation will pay the then base salary  under
Section        3.1 until the end of the month in which
Executive dies,  and except for any rights and benefits
of Executive under  the benefit plans and programs of
the  Corporation including, without limitation, the
Supplemental  Executive Retirement Plan  in which
Executive is a  participant,  as determined in
accordance with the terms and provisions  of
such  plans  and programs.  The payout under the  EAIP,
or equivalent, for the fiscal year in which Executive's
death occurs, shall be annualized and paid at the
normal time  to Executive's  estate  pro rata to the
date  of  death.    The value  of  the "payout amount,"
in cash, for any  executive long  term  incentive plan
established by the  Corporation, the  plan  cycle of
which ends within 12 months  after  the date of
Executive's death, shall be paid at the normal time to
Executive's estate.
                      -14-
<PAGE>

       7.2     In the event that Executive shall become
entitled to salary continuation payments under the
Corporation's Group Long-Term Disability Insurance Plan
or under any generally similar plan then in effect, the
Corporation may, at its option, terminate the
employment of Executive hereunder without further
obligation or liability on the part of the Corporation
under the terms of this Agreement.

       8       Restricted Covenant.

       8.1     In consideration of the Corporation
entering into this   Agreement,   Executive  shall
not,   directly     or indirectly, until July 21, 2000
(unless compliance herewith is excused pursuant to
Section 8.2), be employed by, render services to or
participate in the management, operation  or control
of,  or  serve  as advisor  or  consultant  to  or
otherwise  become  financially interested  (other  than
by passive ownership of securities constituting less
than  one percent  (1%) of such class of securities in
any one  case) in  any  business  of  the  same nature
as  that  now  (or hereafter during the term of this
Agreement) carried on  by the  Corporation or any of
its subsidiaries (a  "Restricted Business").
                     -15-
<PAGE>

       8.2     Should a Change of Control (as defined
in the Corporation's Supplemental Executive Retirement
Plan) occur during the term of employment and should
the Executive terminate his employment for "Good
Reason" (as defined in said Plan) within a period of 18
months following such Change of Control such
termination by Executive shall constitute a waiver by
the Corporation of the restrictive covenant set forth
in Section 8.1 and Executive shall have no further
obligation to comply with its terms.

       8.3     Executive acknowledges and agrees that
in the event of any violation of the restrictive
covenant set forth in Section 8.1, the Corporation
shall be authorized and entitled to obtain from any
court of competent jurisdiction temporary, preliminary
or permanent injunctive relief as well as an equitable
accounting of all profits or benefits arising out of
such violation and any damages for the breach of this
Agreement which may be applicable.  The aforesaid
rights and remedies shall be independent, severable and
cumulative and shall be in addition to any other rights
or remedies to which the Corporation may be entitled.

        8.4      The  restrictions  contained  in  this
Section 8 are intended to be reasonable.  In the  event
that  any restriction contained herein is held  by  any
court of competent jurisdiction or arbitrator to be  in
any  respect  unreasonable, the court  so  holding  may
limit  the territory to which it pertains or the period
of  time  in  which  it operates, or affect  any  other
change to the extent necessary to make it enforceable.
                     -16-
<PAGE>

The remaining provisions shall not be affected, but
shall, subject to the discretion of such court, remain
in full force and effect and any invalid and
unenforceable provision shall be deemed without further
action on the part of the parties hereto modified,
amended and limited to the extent necessary to render
the same valid and enforceable to the maximum extent
permissible.

       8.5     Executive shall hold in a fiduciary
capacity for the benefit of the Corporation all
confidential information, knowledge and data relating
to or concerned with the Corporation's products,
operations, sales, business and affairs which are
proprietary and not readily ascertainable from trade
sources or other publicly available data, and he shall
not, at any time hereafter, use, disclose or divulge
any such confidential information, knowledge or data to
any person, firm or corporation other than to the
Corporation, its subsidiaries or its designees or
except as may otherwise be required in connection with
the business and affairs of the Corporation.  A breach
of Executive's obligations hereunder shall entitle the
Corporation to seek injunctive or equitable relief
and/or damages from any court of competent
jurisdiction.
                        -17-
<PAGE>

       9.      Change of Control Agreements.

               It   is   understood   and   agreed   that none
of the benefits accruing to Executive under the  1991
Key  Employee  Stock Option Plan or Supplemental
Executive Retirement Plan resulting from a "change of
control"  shall derogate  from the rights granted to
Executive  under  this Agreement, and the rights
granted to him thereunder  shall, subject  to the
triggering events thereof, be supplementary to and not
in substitution for his rights hereunder.

       10.     General.

       10.1    Subject to Section 8.2 and Section 9
hereof, this Agreement   constitutes  the  entire
agreement  concerning Executive's  employment, and no
amendment  or  modification hereof shall be valid or
binding unless made in writing and signed  by  the
party against whom enforcement  thereof  is sought.

       10.2      The provisions of Section 8 hereof shall
survive the termination or expiration of this
Agreement.

       10.3    Any notice required, permitted, or
desired to be given pursuant to any of the provisions
of this Agreement shall be deemed to have been
sufficiently given or served for all purposes if
delivered in person or sent by registered or certified
mail, return receipt requested, postage and fees
prepaid, as follows:
                     -18-
<PAGE>

               605 Third Avenue
               New York, New York  10158

               Attention:  W. Bradford Wiley II

               with a copy to:

               Richard S. Rudick, Esq.
               John Wiley & Sons, Inc.
               605 Third Avenue
               New York, New York  10158

               If to Executive, at:
               300 East 54th Street
               Apartment 34K
               New York, New York  10022

Either of the parties hereto may at any time and from
time to  time change the address to which notices shall
be  sent hereunder by notice to the other party.

       10.4    No course of dealing or any delay on the
part of the  Corporation  or  Executive in  exercising
any  rights hereunder shall operate as a waiver of any
such rights.  No waiver of any default or breach of
this Agreement shall  be deemed a continuing waiver of
any other breach or default.

       10.5    This Agreement relates to services to be
performed   principally  in,  and  accordingly   shall
be governed, interpreted and construed in accordance
with  the laws of the State of New York.
                       -19-
<PAGE>

       10.6    If any provision or part of this
Agreement shall be  held or declared to be void,
invalid or illegal for any reason  by  any  court  of
competent  jurisdiction,   such provision or part shall
be ineffective but shall not in any way  invalidate or
affect any other provision  or  part  of this
Agreement.

       10.7    This Agreement, and the respective
rights and obligations  of the parties hereunder, shall
inure  to  the benefit of, and shall be binding upon,
the Corporation  and its successors and assigns.

       10.8    Should there arise any claim, dispute or
controversy  relating  to  this Agreement,  or  the
breach thereof, the parties shall use their best
efforts and  good will  to  settle  such  claim,
dispute  or  controversy  by amicable negotiations.
Except as provided in Sections  8.2 and 8.4, any such
claim, dispute or controversy that arises between the
parties relating to this Agreement that is  not
amicably  settled  shall  be resolved  by  arbitration,
as follows.

       10.8.1  Any such arbitration shall be heard in
New York,  New  York, before a panel consisting of one
(1)  to three  (3)  arbitrators, each of whom shall  be
impartial. Except  as the parties may otherwise agree,
all arbitrators shall  be  appointed in the first
instance by the President of  the Association of the
Bar of the City of New York  or, in     the  event  of
his  unavailability  by   reason        of
disqualification  or  otherwise, by  the  Chairman   of
the  Executive  Committee of the Association of the Bar
of  the City   of
                       -20-
<PAGE>

New  York.   In  determining  the  number    and
appropriate  background of the arbitrators, the
appointing authority shall give due consideration to
the issues to  be resolved,  but his decision as to the
number of arbitrators and  their  identity shall be
final.  Except  as  otherwise provided  in  this
Section 10.8, or  as  the  parties  may otherwise
agree, arbitration hereunder shall be governed by the
rules of the American Arbitration Association, as they
then exist.

       10.8.2  An arbitration may be commenced by any
party to  this Agreement by the service of a written
Request  for Arbitration upon the other affected
parties.  Such  Request for Arbitration shall summarize
the controversy or claim to be  arbitrated,  and shall
be referred by  the  complaining party  to  the
appointing  authority  for  appointment  of arbitrators
ten  (10)  days  following  such  service or
                     -21-
<PAGE>

thereafter.   If the panel of arbitrators is not
appointed by   the  appointing  authority  within
thirty  (30)  days following such reference, any party
may apply to any  court within  the  State  of  New
York for  an  order  appointing arbitrators  qualified
as set forth below.  No Request  for Arbitration  shall
be  valid if it  relates  to  a  claim, dispute,
disagreement or controversy that would have  been time
barred under the applicable statute of limitations had
such  claim, dispute or controversy been submitted  to
the Supreme Court of the State of New York.

       10.8.3  All attorneys' fees and costs of the
arbitration  shall in the first instance be  borne  by
the respective  party incurring such costs and  fees,
but  the arbitrators shall have the discretion to award
costs and/or attorneys'  fees  as  they  deem
appropriate   under the circumstances.   In  addition
to the waiver  set  forth  in Section  6.3  above,  the
parties hereby  expressly  waive punitive damages, and
under no circumstances shall an award contain  any
amount  that  in any  way  reflects  punitive damages.

       10.8.4   Judgment on the award rendered by the
arbitrators may be entered in any court having
jurisdiction thereof.

       10.8.5  It is intended that claims, disputes or
controversies submitted to arbitration under  this
Section 10.8  shall  remain confidential, and to  that
end  it  is agreed  by the parties that neither the
facts disclosed  in the  arbitration, the issues
arbitrated, nor the  views  or opinions of any persons
concerning them, shall be disclosed to  third  persons
at  any  time,  except  to  the  extent necessary to
enforce an award or judgment or as required by law  or
in response to legal process or in connection  with
such arbitration.

       IN  WITNESS  WHEREOF, the  parties  hereto  have
caused this Agreement to be duly executed as of the day
and year first above written.
