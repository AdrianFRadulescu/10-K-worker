<PAGE>
                          PART I
Item 1.   Business

     The Company is a New York corporation incorporated on
January 15, 1904. (As used herein the term "Company" means
John  Wiley  &  Sons,  Inc.,  and  its  subsidiaries   and
affiliated   companies,  unless  the   context   indicates
otherwise).

      The Company operates in one business segment, namely
publishing,   which  develops,  publishes,   and   markets
products   in  print  and  electronic  formats   including
textbooks,  professional  and  reference  works,  consumer
books,  journals,  and other subscription-based  products,
for  the  educational, scientific, technical, professional
and    trade   markets   in   the   United   States    and
internationally.

      Textbooks are produced primarily for use  in  formal
instruction in the college and university markets, as well
as   the  secondary  school  market  in  Australia,  while
professional    and   reference   books,    encyclopedias,
dictionaries,  and periodicals are intended primarily  for
practicing  and research professionals and for  libraries.
Some   of   these,   as   well  as   nonfiction   consumer
publications, are also marketed to the general public.  in
addition,  the Company markets and distributes books  from
other  publishers.  The Company also develops and  markets
electronic  versions of certain of its print products,  as
well  as  computer software and electronic data bases  for
educational  use and professional research  and  training.
Book  publications are primarily in the areas of pure  and
applied  science,  engineering, architecture,  the  social
sciences,  biomedicine, accounting, law, computer  science
and  business  administration.  Journal  publications  are
primarily  in the scientific and technical, and biomedical
research areas.

       In  fiscal  1996,  the  Company  acquired  Clinical
Psychology  Publishing  Company  (CPPC),  a  publisher  of
journals   and  books  in  the  fields  of  clinical   and
educational  psychology; Preservation Press consisting  of
architectural   heritage  books,  technical   preservation
guides  and  children's architecture  books;  and  certain
other  smaller  publishing properties.  In  addition,  the
Company  became  the  publisher of  Cancer,  the  American
Cancer Society's medical journal.

<PAGE>

      Subsequent to the fiscal 1996 year-end, the  Company
acquired a 90% interest in the German based VCH Publishing
Group  (VCH) for approximately $100 million in cash.   VCH
publishes  nearly 100 scholarly and professional journals,
as  well  as more than 500 books annually, with a backlist
of  3,000 titles.  VCH is a leading scientific, technical,
and   professional  publisher  in  chemistry  and  related
disciplines.  The group also includes Akademie  Verlag,  a
science  and  humanities  publisher;  Ernst  &  Sohn,   an
architecture  and  civil  engineering  publisher;  Academy
Group,  a  London-based architecture and design publisher;
and  Chemical  Concepts, an electronic  chemical  database
publisher.

      The company is on the Internet with a World Wide Web
site located at http://www.wiley.com.

Domestic Publishing Operations

      Adopted  textbooks (i.e., textbooks  prescribed  for
course  use)  are  sold  primarily to  bookstores  serving
educational  institutions  in  the  United  States  (i.e.,
college  bookstores).  The Company employs  college  sales
representatives who call upon faculty members  responsible
for  selecting books to be used in courses, and  upon  the
college bookstores which serve such institutions and their
students.   Approximately 2,400 domestic college bookstore
accounts   are  active  customers.   Textbook  sales   are
generally made on a fully returnable basis.

      The  textbook business is seasonal with the majority
of textbook sales occurring during June through August and
November   through   January.   Significant   amounts   of
inventory are acquired prior to those periods in order  to
meet  customer delivery requirements.  There is an  active
used textbook market which negatively affects the sales of
new textbooks.

     Professional and consumer book sales consist of sales
to   trade  bookstores  serving  the  general  public,  to
wholesalers who supply such bookstores, to certain college
bookstores   for   their  non-textbook  requirements,   to
individual  professional practitioners,  and  to  research
institutions,   jobbers,  libraries   (including   public,
professional,  academic,  and  other  special  libraries),
industrial organizations, and governmental agencies.   The
Company  employs  sales  representatives  who  call   upon
independent  bookstores, along with national and  regional
chain  bookstores, wholesalers and jobbers in  the  United
States.   Trade  sales  to  bookstores,  wholesalers   and
jobbers are generally made on a fully returnable basis.

      Sales of professional and consumer books also result
from direct mail campaigns, telemarketing, and advertising
and  reviews in periodicals.  The mailings and advertising
are  intended  to  promote sales  through  bookstores  and
jobbers, as well as to solicit sales directly.

<PAGE>
      Journal  subscriptions result primarily from  direct
mail  and  other  advertising and  promotional  campaigns,
renewals  which are solicited annually either directly  or
by   companies   commonly  referred  to   as   independent
subscription  agents, and memberships in the  professional
societies  for those journals that are sponsored  by  such
societies.

      The  Company  also receives licensing revenues  from
photocopies  and  electronic  reproductions   of   journal
articles and other materials.

      Domestic  publishing products, other than  journals,
are  distributed from a Company operated warehouse located
in   Somerset,  New  Jersey.   Journals  are   mailed   to
subscribers directly from the independent printers.

International Publishing Operations

      The  Company's publications are sold throughout most
of  the  world  through subsidiaries  located  in  Europe,
Canada,  Australia,  and  Asia,  or  through  agents,   or
directly  from New York.  These subsidiaries market  their
own  indigenous  publications,  as  well  as  publications
produced by the domestic operations and other subsidiaries
and affiliates.

      The Export Sales Department in New York markets  the
Company's  publications through agents as well as  foreign
sales representatives in countries not served by a foreign
subsidiary.  John Wiley & Sons International Rights,  Inc.
sells  foreign  reprint  and  translations  rights.    The
Company  publishes,  or licenses others  to  publish,  its
products which are distributed throughout the world in  40
foreign languages.

      Approximately  41%  of  the  Company's  fiscal  1996
revenues were derived from non-U.S. markets.

Publishing Procedures

      The  Company  usually  enters into  agreements  with
authors  which state the terms and conditions under  which
the  respective authors' materials will be  published  and
under  which  other related rights may be  exercised,  the
name  in which the copyright will be registered, the basis
for   any  royalties,  and  other  matters.   The  Company
continues  to add new titles, revise existing titles,  and
discontinue the sale of others in the normal course of its
business.

      Most  of the authors of the books and other products
published are compensated by royalties which vary with the
nature of the product and its anticipated sales potential.
In general, royalties for textbooks and consumer books are
higher  than  royalties for research and reference  works.
The  Company  makes advances against future  royalties  to
authors of certain of its publications.
<PAGE>
      Materials for publication are obtained from  authors
throughout  most of the world through the  efforts  of  an
editorial staff, outside editorial advisors, and  advisory
boards.  Most materials originate with their authors,  but
many   are   prepared  as  a  result  of  suggestions   or
solicitations  by  editors  or  advisors.   The  Company's
general  practice is to revise its basic  textbooks  every
three  to  five years, if warranted, and to  revise  other
titles as appropriate.  Approximately 36% of the Company's
fiscal  1996 domestic book publishing revenues  were  from
titles   published  or  revised  in  that   fiscal   year.
Subscription-based  products,  other  than  journals,  are
updated more frequently on a regular schedule.

     Most journals are owned by the Company, in which case
they  may  or  may  not  be sponsored  by  a  professional
society.   Some are owned by such societies and  published
by  the  Company  under  an  agreement.   Societies  which
sponsor  or own such journals generally receive a  royalty
and/or other consideration which varies with the nature of
the   relationship.   The  Company  usually  enters   into
agreements  with the editors of journals which  state  the
duties of the editors, and the fees and expenses for their
services.   Contributions  of  journal  articles  transfer
publication rights to the Company or professional society,
as applicable.  Journal revenues represented approximately
31% of the Company's fiscal 1996 revenues.

      The  Company's publishing business is not  dependent
upon  a  single customer, the loss of whom  could  have  a
material  adverse  effect.   Approximately  86%   of   the
Company's journal subscription business is sourced through
independent   subscription   agents.    These    companies
facilitate  the journal ordering process by  consolidating
the   subscription  orders/billings  of  each  subscriber.
Monies  are collected in advance from subscribers  by  the
subscription  agents  and  are  remitted  to  the  journal
publishers, including the Company, generally prior to  the
commencement  of  the subscription.   Cash  receipts  from
subscription   agents  are  highly  dependent   on   their
financial  position and liquidity.  No one agent  accounts
for more than 6% of total consolidated revenues.

      The  Company  performs  marketing  and  distribution
services  for  other publishers under agency arrangements.
It  also  engages in co-publishing of titles with  foreign
publishers and in publication of adaptations of works from
other publishers for particular markets.

      Like  most  other publishers, the Company  generally
contracts  with  independent printers  and  binderies  for
their  services.   The Company purchases  its  paper  from
printers  and  from independent suppliers.   Paper  prices
have  increased  over  the past few  years.   The  Company
believes  that  adequate printing and binding  facilities,
and  sources  of  paper and other required  materials  are
available  to  it, and that it is not dependent  upon  any
single supplier.

<PAGE>

      The Company produces electronic versions of some  of
its   products  including  software,  video,  CD-ROM,  and
through on-line services.  Approximately 700 products  are
available in electronic formats, of which 200 are  primary
stand-alone   products  with  the  remainder  representing
supplemental products in support of other print  products.
The  Company  believes that the demand for new  electronic
technology   products  will  increase.   Accordingly,   to
properly  service its customers and to remain competitive,
the  Company anticipates it will be necessary to  increase
its expenditures related to such new technologies over the
next several years.

Copyrights, Patents, Trademarks, and Environment

      Substantially all of the Company's publications  are
protected  by  copyright, either in its own name,  in  the
name  of  the  author of the work, or in the name  of  the
sponsoring professional society.  Such copyrights  protect
the  Company's exclusive right to publish the work in  the
United  States and in many countries abroad for  specified
periods:   in most cases the author's life plus 50  years,
but in any event a minimum of 28 years for works published
prior to 1978 and 35 years for works published thereafter.

      The Company does not own any other material patents,
franchises,  or  concessions,  but  does  have  registered
trademarks  and  service  marks  in  connection  with  its
publishing  businesses.   The  Company's  operations   are
generally not affected by environmental legislation.

Competition Within the Publishing Industry

      The sectors of the publishing industry in which  the
Company  is engaged are highly competitive.  The principal
competitive  criteria  for  the  publishing  industry  are
believed to be product quality, suitability of format  and
subject   matter,   author   reputation,   price,   timely
availability of both new titles and revisions of  existing
texts  and, for textbooks and certain trade books,  timely
delivery of products to retail outlets.  Recent years have
seen a consolidation trend within the publishing industry,
with several publishing companies having been acquired  by
larger publishers and other companies.

      Based  upon currently available industry statistics,
the  Company believes that of books published and sold  in
the United States, it accounts for approximately 3% of the
total sales of such university and college textbooks,  and
approximately  3% of the total sales of such  professional
books.

<PAGE>

      The Company knows of no reliable industry statistics
which  would  enable  it to determine  its  share  of  the
various  foreign  markets  in  which  its  operates.   The
Company  believes that the percentage of  its  total  book
publishing sales in markets outside the United  States  is
higher  than that of most of the United States publishers.
The Company also believes, with the acquisition of VCH, it
is   the  second  largest  publisher  of  scientific   and
technical  journals  worldwide, as  well  as  the  leading
commercial  chemistry  publisher, and  one  of  the  three
largest publishers of university and college textbooks for
the "hardside" disciplines, i.e. engineering, sciences and
mathematics.

Employees

       As   of   April  30,  1996,  the  Company  employed
approximately   1,830  persons  on   a   full-time   basis
worldwide,   none  of  whom  are  unionized.    Management
considers  relations with its employees  to  be  generally
satisfactory.

         REPORT OF INDEPENDENT PUBLIC ACCOUNTANTS


To the Board of Directors and the Shareholders
of John Wiley & Sons, Inc.:

       We   have  audited  the  accompanying  consolidated
statements  of  financial position of John Wiley  &  Sons,
Inc.  (a  New  York corporation), and subsidiaries  as  of
April  30,  1996  and  1995, and the related  consolidated
statements of income and retained earnings and cash  flows
for  each of the three years in the period ended April 30,
1996.    These  financial  statements  and  the   schedule
referred  to below are the responsibility of the Company's
management.  Our responsibility is to express  an  opinion
on  these  financial statements and the schedule based  on
our audits.

      We conducted our audits in accordance with generally
accepted auditing standards.  Those standards require that
we  plan  and  perform  the  audit  to  obtain  reasonable
assurance about whether the financial statements are  free
of material misstatement.  An audit includes examining, on
a   test  basis,  evidence  supporting  the  amounts   and
disclosures  in the financial statements.  An  audit  also
includes  assessing  the accounting  principles  used  and
significant  estimates  made by  management,  as  well  as
evaluating  the overall financial statement  presentation.
We  believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for
our opinion.

      In our opinion, the financial statements referred to
above  present  fairly,  in  all  material  respects,  the
financial  position  of  John  Wiley  &  Sons,  Inc.,  and
subsidiaries  as  of  April 30, 1996  and  1995,  and  the
results of their operations and their cash flows for  each
of  the three years in the period ended April 30, 1996  in
conformity with generally accepted accounting principles.

      Our  audits were made for the purpose of forming  an
opinion  on  the  basic financial statements  taken  as  a
whole.   The  schedule listed in the Index to Consolidated
Financial  Statements  and  Schedules  is  presented   for
purposes  of  complying with the Securities  and  Exchange
Commission's rules and is not a required part of the basic
financial statements.  This schedule has been subjected to
the auditing procedures applied in the audits of the basic
financial statements and, in our opinion, is fairly stated
in   all  material  respects  in  relation  to  the  basic
financial statements taken as a whole.

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements
Summary of Significant Accounting Policies

Principles     of    Consolidation:     The    consolidated     financial
statements    include   the   accounts   of   John    Wiley    &    Sons,
Inc.,    and    its   majority-owned   subsidiaries   ("the    Company").
All    significant    intercompany   items    have    been    eliminated.
Prior   year   per   share  data  has  been  restated  to   reflect   the
2-for-1 stock split in October 1995.
Use    of   Estimates:    The   preparation   of   financial   statements
in      conformity      with      generally      accepted      accounting
principles     requires    management    to    make     estimates     and
assumptions   that   affect   the  reported   amounts   of   assets   and
liabilities     and     disclosure    of    contingent     assets     and
liabilities    at   the   date   of   the   financial   statements    and
reported    amounts    of    revenues    and    expenses    during    the
reporting    period.    Actual   results   could   differ   from    those
estimates.

Sales    Returns   and   Doubtful   Accounts:   The   Company    provides
an    estimated    allowance    for    doubtful    accounts    and    for
future    returns    on    sales    made    during    the    year.    The
allowance     for    doubtful    accounts    and    returns    (estimated
returns   net   of  inventory  and  royalty  costs)   is   shown   as   a
reduction    of    receivables    in   the   accompanying    consolidated
balance   sheets   and   amounted  to  $26.8   and   $22.6   million   at
April 30, 1996 and 1995, respectively.

Depreciation    and    Amortization:   Furniture   and    equipment    is
depreciated    principally    on   the    straight-line    method    over
estimated    useful    lives   ranging    from    3    to    10    years.
Leasehold    improvements    and    capital    leases    are    amortized
over    the   lesser   of   the   estimated   useful   lives    of    the
assets   or   the   duration   of   the   various   leases,   using   the
straight-line    method.     Composition    costs    representing     the
costs     incurred     to     bring    an    edited     manuscript     to
publication      including     typesetting,     proofreading,      design
and    illustration,   etc.   are   capitalized   and   amortized    over
estimated    useful    lives   representative    of    product    revenue
patterns, generally 3 years.

Intangible    Assets:    Intangible   assets    consist    of    acquired
publication    rights,    which   are   principally    amortized    based
on    the    projected   revenues   of   titles   acquired,   non-compete
agreements,    which   are   amortized   over   the    term    of    such
agreements,   and   goodwill   and   other   intangibles,    which    are
amortized    on   a   straight   line   basis   over   periods    ranging
from   5   to   40   years.    If   facts  and   circumstances   indicate
that   intangible   assets   may   be   permanently   impaired,   it   is
the    Company's    policy   to   assess   the   carrying    value    and
recoverability    of   such   assets   based   on    an    analysis    of
undiscounted    future   cash   flows   of   the   related    operations.
Any   resulting   reduction   in  carrying   value   would   be   charged
to operating results.

<PAGE>

Income    Per    Share:    Income   per   share    is    determined    by
dividing   income   by   the   weighted   average   number   of    common
shares    outstanding    and   common   stock    equivalents    resulting
from    the    assumed   exercise   of   outstanding    dilutive    stock
options   and   other   stock   awards  less   shares   assumed   to   be
repurchased    with    the    related    proceeds    at    the    average
market    price    for    the   period   for   primary    earnings    per
share,   and   at   the  higher  of  the  average  or   end   of   period
market price for fully diluted earnings per share.

Subscription    Revenues:    Subscription    revenues    are    generally
collected    in    advance.    These   revenues    are    deferred    and
recognized   as   earned   when  the  related   issue   is   shipped   to
the     subscriber.

Foreign    Exchange    Contracts:     The     Company,
from   time   to   time,   enters   into   forward   exchange   contracts
as     a     hedge    against    its    overseas    subsidiaries'    non-
functional      currency     asset,     liability,     and     commitment
exposures.     Such     exposures     include     anticipated      annual
journal   subscription   revenues,   as   well   as   that   portion   of
the    revenues    and   related   receivables   on   sales    of    book
products,   that   are   denominated   in   U.S.   dollars,   while   the
foreign    subsidiaries'   expense   structure    is    denominated    in
their    own    functional   currencies.    Realized    and    unrealized
gains   and   losses   are   deferred  and   taken   into   income   over
the   lives   of   the   hedged   items   if   permitted   by   generally
accepted     accounting    principles;    otherwise     the     contracts
are   marked   to   market   with   any  gains   and   losses   reflected
in     operating    expenses.     There    were    no    open     foreign
exchange    contracts,   and   no   gains   or   losses   were   deferred
at April 30, 1996 or 1995.

Cash    Equivalents:    Cash    equivalents    consist    primarily    of
highly   liquid   investments   with   a   maturity   of   three   months
or   less   and   are  stated  at  cost  plus  accrued   interest   which
approximates market value.

New    Accounting    Standards:    In   March   1995,    the    Financial
Accounting    Standards    Board   issued    Statement    of    Financial
Accounting    Standards   (SFAS)   No.   121,   "Accounting    for    the
Impairment    of   Long-lived   Assets   and   for   Long-lived    Assets
to    be    Disposed    Of"    for   fiscal   years    beginning    after
December   15,   1995.    The  Company  intends   to   adopt   SFAS   No.
121   in   fiscal  year  1997,  and  does  not  expect  the   impact   on
its   financial   position   or  its  results   of   operations   to   be
material.

        In    October   1995,   the   Financial   Accounting    Standards
Board    issued    SFAS    No.   123,   "Accounting    for    Stock-Based
Compensation"     which     requires     certain     disclosures      for
fiscal   years   beginning   after   December   15,   1995   for    those
companies    that    will   continue   to   use   an   intrinsic    value
based    method   for   measuring   compensation   cost   in   connection
with     employee    stock    compensation    plans.      The     Company
currently    plans    to   continue   to   use   the   intrinsic    value
based   method   and   will   adopt  the   disclosure   requirements   in
fiscal 1997.

       In   fiscal   1994,   the   Company  acquired   the   professional
computer    book    line   of   QED   Information   Services    in    the
United    States;   Belhaven   Press,   which   publishes    earth    and

interest     in     Protocols,    which    publishes     life     science
continuity    products,    for   purchase   prices    aggregating    $8.3
million.    The   excess   of  cost  over   the   fair   value   of   the
tangible    assets    acquired    amounted    to    approximately    $6.9
million,     of     which    $.5    million    related    to     acquired

agreements,     and    $6.1    million    represented    goodwill     and
other intangibles which are being amortized over 15 years.

        The    fiscal   1996   and   prior   acquisitions    have    been
accounted   for   by   the   purchase  method,   and   the   accompanying
financial    statements    include   their    results    of    operations
since    their   respective   dates   of   acquisition.   The    proforma
effects     on     the     results    of     operations     for     these
acquisitions were not material.

Divested and Restructured Operations

        In    fiscal   1994,   the   Company   divested   its    Canadian
high    school    and    Australian   primary    school    and    certain
agency    lines    for    aggregate    proceeds    of    $9.2    million,
resulting   in   a   gain  of  $1.8  million,  or  $1.3   million   after
taxes.     In    addition,   in   a   cost   saving    initiative,    the
Company    restructured    and    consolidated    certain    distribution
and      information      technology     support     functions      which
resulted   in   an   unusual   charge   of   $1.8   million,   or    $1.1
million    after   taxes.    The   net   effect   of   the   divestitures
and    restructurings   amounted   to   an   after-tax   gain   of    $.2
million, or $.01 per share in fiscal 1994.

       In   fiscal   1996,   the   Company  received   approximately   $6
million    of    net    federal,   state   and    local    tax    refunds
including    interest   on   the   favorable   resolution   of    amended
tax    return    claims   of   prior   years   primarily   relating    to
timing    differences.    Net   income   for   fiscal    1996    includes
interest   income   related   thereto   of   $4.4   million,   or    $2.6
million after taxes, equal to $.16 per share.

<PAGE>
       In   general,   the   Company  plans   to   continue   to   invest
the    undistributed   earnings   of   its   foreign   subsidiaries    in
those   businesses   and   therefore,   no   provision   is   made    for
taxes    which    would    be    payable   if    such    earnings    were
distributed.   At   April   30,   1996,   the   undistributed    earnings
of    foreign   subsidiaries   approximated   $26.3   million   and,   if
remitted     currently,    would    result    in     additional     taxes
approximating $1.8 million.

Notes Payable and Debt

        The    Company   has   a   revolving   credit   agreement    with
three    banks   providing   a   line   of   credit   of   $50    million
until    March    30,   2000.   The   Company   has   the    option    of
borrowing    Eurodollars    at   a   rate    based    on    the    London
Interbank    Offered   Rate   (LIBOR)   or   dollars   at   the    banks'
prime   rate   or   at   a   rate  based  on  the   current   certificate
of    deposit   rate.    A   facility   fee   ranging   from   .125%   to
 .25%    depending   on   certain   coverage   ratios   is   charged    on
the    total    commitment.    In   the   event   of    a    change    of
control,    as    defined,    the    banks    have    the    option    to
terminate    the    agreement    and    require    repayment    of    any
amounts   outstanding.   The   Company   and   its   subsidiaries    also
have    other    short-term    lines   of    credit    aggregating    $51
million   at   various   interest   rates.   Information   relating    to
short-term lines of credit follows:

               The      Company's     revolving     credit      agreement
contains    certain    restrictive   covenants   related    to    minimum
net    worth,    funded    debt    levels,    financial    ratios,    and
restricted    payments,   including   a   cumulative    limitation    for
dividends     paid.     Under    the    most    restrictive     covenant,
approximately   $48   million   was  available   for   the   payment   of
future dividends as of April 30, 1996.
        Subsequent   to   the   fiscal   1996   year-end,   the   Company
obtained    bridge    financing    for    the    VCH    acquisition    by
entering    into   a   credit   agreement   with   a   bank    and    its
assigns   providing   a   line   of   credit   of   $75   million    thru
June    11,    1997   on   terms   similar   to   the   above   mentioned
revolving credit agreement.

<PAGE>
       In   fiscal   1995,   the  Company  prepaid  the   remaining   $26
million     of     the     10.31%    long-term     notes     outstanding.
Although    the    Company   incurred   prepayment    costs    of    $1.6
million,   which   was   included   in   interest   income   and   other,
the    Company   benefits   by   eliminating   the   negative    interest
rate   spread   between   the   higher  interest   rate   on   the   debt
retired    compared    with   the   current    interest    rates    being
earned     on     short-term    investments.     Also     included     in
interest    income   and   other   were   a   gain   of   $1.5    million
related   to   the   sale   of   shares   of   Nippon   Wilson   Learning
which   were   received   in   connection   with   the   sale   of    the
Company's training business in fiscal 1991.

Retirement Plans

        The    Company    and    its    principal    subsidiaries    have
contributory     and    noncontributory    retirement     plans     which
cover     substantially    all    employees.    The    plans    generally
provide   for   employee  retirement  between   the   ages   of   60   to
65    and    benefits   based   on   length   of   service   and    final
average    compensation,    as   defined.    In    fiscal    1995,    the
domestic    plan   was   amended   to   provide   that   final    average
compensation    be    based    on   the   highest    three    consecutive
years   ended   December   31,   1993.    The   Company   may,   but   is
not   required   to,   update  from  time  to  time   the   ending   date
for   the   three-year   period   used   to   determine   final   average
compensation.    The   amendment   had   the   effect    of    increasing
pension    expense    for    fiscal    1995    by    approximately    $.2
million.   Funds   are   contributed  as   necessary   to   provide   for
current    service    and    for    a    portion    of    any    unfunded
projected     benefit     obligation.     To     the     extent     these
requirements    are   exceeded   by   plan   assets,    a    contribution
may   not   be   made   in  a  particular  year.  Plan   assets   consist
principally    of   investments   in   corporate   stocks    and    bonds
and government obligations.

       Pension costs for the defined benefit plans were as follows:

        The    net    pension   expense   included    above    for    the
international    plans    amounted   to   approximately    $1.1,    $1.0,
and $1.0 million for 1996, 1995, and 1994, respectively.

       The   Company   has   agreements   with   certain   officers   and
senior    management   personnel   that   provide   for    the    payment
of   supplemental   retirement   benefits   during   each   of   the   10
years    after    the   termination   of   employment.   Under    certain
circumstances,    including   a   change   of   control    as    defined,
the    payment   of   such   amounts   could   be   accelerated   on    a
present   value   basis.   The   cost  of   these   benefits   is   being
charged    to   expense   on   a   present   value   basis    over    the
estimated    term   of   employment   and   amounted   to   approximately
$1.0,    $.9    and    $.7   million   in   1996,    1995    and    1994,
respectively.

        The   Company   provides   life   insurance   and   health   care
benefits,     subject     to    certain    dollar     limitations     and
retiree     contributions,    for    substantially     all     of     its
retired   domestic   employees.   The   cost   of   such   benefits    is
expensed   over   the   years   that   the   employees   render   service
and    are    funded    on   a   pay-as-you-go,    cash    basis.     The
accumulated    post-retirement    benefit    obligation    amounted    to
$.3    and    $.2    million    at   April    30,    1996    and    1995,
respectively,   and   the   amount   expensed   in   fiscal   1996    and
prior years was not material.

                                  -----------------------------------------

         Future     minimum     payments    under    operating     leases
aggregated     $97.2    million    at    April    30,    1996.     Annual
payments    under    these    leases    are    $14.4,    $13.4,    $13.1,
$12.9,    and    $12.4   million   for   fiscal   years   1997    through
2001,    respectively.   The   Company   is   guarantor   through    1998
of   certain   lease   obligations  assumed   by   the   buyer   of   the
domestic   training   operations   which   were   divested   in    fiscal
1991,   aggregating   approximately   $2.0   million,   which   is    net
of the 50% guarantee provided by the parent of the buyer.
       The   Company   is   involved  in  routine   litigation   in   the
ordinary    course    of    its   business.    In    the    opinion    of
management,     the     ultimate    resolution     of     all     pending
litigation    will    not    have   a   material    effect    upon    the
financial    condition    or    results    of    operations    of     the
Company.

       Options   were   granted   on  the  Company's   Class   A   Common
stock   and   are   exercisable,   in   part   or   in   full,   over   a
maximum   period   of   10   years  from  the   date   of   grant   under
various     stock    option    plans.    Outstanding     options     were
granted   at   prices   not   less  than  100%   of   the   fair   market
value   of   the   stock   at   the  date  the  options   were   granted.
Under    certain    circumstances    relating    to    a    change     of
control,     as    defined,    the    right    to    exercise     options
outstanding could be accelerated.

     Option activity under existing plans was as follows:

       Under   the   terms   of   the   Company's   executive   long-term
incentive    plans,    upon   the   achievement   of    certain    three-
year    financial   performance   based   targets,   awards    will    be
payable   in   cash   and/or   restricted   shares   of   the   Company's
Class   A   Common   stock   at  the  end  of   the   plan   cycle.   The
restricted   shares   vest  equally  as  to  50%   on   the   first   and
second    anniversary    date   after   the    date    the    award    is
earned.   The   amount   charged   to  expense   for   such   plans   was
approximately   $.9,   $.8   and  $.7   million   in   1996,   1995   and
1994,    respectively.     Restricted    shares    earned    under    the
plans   amounted   to   8,650,   11,084  and   33,640   in   1996,   1995
and 1994, respectively.

       In   both   fiscal   1996  and  1995,  the  Company   granted   in
each    year   a   total   of   90,000   restricted   shares    of    the
Company's    Class    A    Common   stock   to   four    key    executive
officers    in    connection    with   their    employment    agreements.
The    restricted   shares   vest   one-third   at   the   end   of   the
third,   fourth   and   fifth   years,   respectively,   following    the
date    of    the   grant.    Under   certain   circumstances    relating
to    a   change   of   control   or   termination,   as   defined,   the
restrictions    would    lapse   and   shares   would    vest    earlier.
Compensation    expense    aggregating    $4.4    million    is     being
charged   to   earnings   ratably  over  five   years,   or   sooner   if
vesting    is    accelerated,   from   the   dates    of    grant,    and
amounted   to   $.9   and   $.3  million  in  fiscal   1996   and   1995,
respectively.

       Under   the   terms   of  the  Company's  Director   Stock   Plan,
each    member   of   the   Board   of   Directors   who   is   not    an
employee   of   the   Company   is   awarded   Class   A   Common   stock
equal    to    50%    of   the   board   member's   cash    compensation,
based   on   the  market  value  of  the  stock  on  the  date   of   the
shareholders'     meeting.     Directors    may     also     elect     to
receive   all   or   a   portion   of   their   cash   compensation    in
stock.    Compensation   cost   related   to   this   plan   charged   to
expense    amounted    to   approximately   $.2    million    in    1996,
1995   and   1994,   respectively.   Under   this   plan   5,752,   8,662
and    13,692   shares   were   issued   in   1996,   1995,   and   1994,
respectively.

          Management's Discussion and Analysis of
            Financial Condition and Results of
                        Operations
                             
Results of Operations:
Fiscal 1996 Compared to Fiscal 1995

       In   1996,   the   Company  continued   to   expand   its   global
operations   and   grow  its  core  businesses,   while   at   the   same
time   improving   its   profitability,  cash   flows   and   return   on
investment.

       The   Company   invested   a  total   of   $4.0   million   during
the    year    to    acquire    the   Clinical   Psychology    Publishing
Company   (CPPC),   a   publisher  of   journals   and   books   in   the
fields       of       clinical      and      educational      psychology;
Preservation     Press     consisting    of    architectural     heritage
books,      technical     preservation     guides     and      children's
architecture    books;    and    certain   other    smaller    publishing
properties.     The    Company    also   became    the    publisher    of
Cancer, the American Cancer Society's medical journal.

        Subsequent   to   the   fiscal   1996   year-end,   the   Company
acquired   a   90%   interest  in  the  German   based   VCH   Publishing
Group   (VCH)   for   approximately   $100   million   in   cash.     VCH
has    annual    revenues    of    approximately    $60    million    and
publishes    nearly    100    scholarly   and   professional    journals,
as   well   as   more   than  500  books  annually,   with   a   backlist
of   3,000   titles.    VCH   is   a   leading   scientific,   technical,
and     professional     publisher    in    chemistry     and     related
disciplines.     The   group   also   includes   Akademie    Verlag,    a
science     and    humanities    publisher;    Ernst    &    Sohn,     an
architecture     and     civil     engineering     publisher;     Academy
Group,    a    London-based    architecture   and    design    publisher;
and     Chemical    Concepts,    an    electronic    chemical    database
publisher.    The    Company    currently    anticipates     that     the
acquisition    will   dilute   income   per   share   for   approximately
two    years    following    the    acquisition.     The    extent    and
duration    of    the   dilution   will   depend   primarily    on    the
amortization    of    intangibles,    financing    costs,    and    VCH's
future operating results.

       Revenues   for   the   year  advanced  10%   to   $362.7   million
led    by    the   Company's   worldwide   scientific,   technical    and
medical      journal     programs,     college     texts     and      the
professional/trade    computer   and   business    book    lines.     The
domestic      scientific,     technical     and     medical      division
registered    a    14%   increase   in   revenues   and   the    domestic
professional/trade   division   revenues   increased    9%    over    the
prior      year.      The     domestic     college     division     again
outperformed   the   industry  as  a  whole  with  a   9%   increase   in
revenues    over   the   prior   year.    The   international   divisions
also    registered    a   9%   improvement   in   revenues    paced    by
European and Asian operations.

       Cost   of   sales   as   a  percentage  of  revenues   was   34.9%
in   1996   compared   with   34.2%   in   the   prior   year   primarily
reflecting increased paper costs.

<PAGE>

        Operating    and    administrative    expenses    increased    by
6.2%   but   declined   as  a  percentage  of  revenues   to   54.7%   in
1996   from   56.5%   as   the   rate   of   growth   in   expenses   was
contained at less than the revenue growth rate.

       Operating   income   increased  23%  over  the   prior   year   to
$33.0   million   primarily   due  to   the   effects   of   the   higher
revenue    base   coupled   with   a   cost   contained   infrastructure.
Operating   income   margins   improved   to   9.1%   of   revenue   from
8.1% in the prior year.

        Net    interest   income   increased   by   $6.9   million   over
the   prior   year   primarily   as  a  result   of   interest   received
on    the   favorable   resolution   of   amended   tax   return   claims
amounting    to   $4.4   million,   or   $2.6   million   after    taxes,
equal   to   $.16   per  share.   The  improvement  was   also   due   to
the   prepayment   of   high  cost  long-term  debt   at   the   end   of
fiscal 1995.

       The   effective   tax   rate  was  36.4%   compared   with   29.0%
in   the   prior   year   due   to  higher   effective   tax   rates   on
state, local and foreign sourced earnings.

Results of Operations:
Fiscal 1995 Compared to Fiscal 1994

       The   Company   invested  $12.3  million  during   the   year   to
acquire    the    publishing    business   of   Executive    Enterprises,
Inc.,    consisting    of   books,   journals   and    newsletters    for
environmental     management,     accounting,     law      and      human
resource       professionals;      ValuSource,       which       produces
specialized     business    valuation    software    for     accountants,
entrepreneurs     and     corporations;    the    college     engineering
list   of   Houghton   Mifflin;   the   book   publishing   program    of

       Revenues   for   the   year  advanced  13%   to   $331.1   million
led   by   the   domestic   professional  and   trade   division,   where
revenues    increased    20%   based   on    the    strength    of    the
business       and      computer-book      lines.       The      domestic
scientific,    technical    and    medical    division    registered    a
10%      improvement      attributable     to      increased      journal
revenues.     The    domestic    college    division    increased     its
market   share   and   outperformed  the   industry   as   a   whole   in
what     was     considered     a    difficult    market     environment.
International      revenues     reflected      significant      increases
over    the   prior   year   led   by   the   Company's   European    and
Asian operations.

       Cost   of   sales   as   a  percentage  of  revenues   was   34.2%
in   1995   compared   with   33.9%   in   the   prior   year   primarily
reflecting increased paper costs.

<PAGE>

        Operating   and   administrative   expenses   as   a   percentage
of   revenues   declined   to  56.5%  in   1995   from   57.8%   as   the
rate   of   growth   in  expenses  was  contained  at   less   than   the
revenue   growth   rate.    This   improvement   was   offset   to   some
degree by unfavorable foreign exchange rates.

       Operating   income   increased  42%  over  the   prior   year   to
$26.9   million   as   revenues  increased  at  a   greater   rate   than
operating expenses.

       Interest   expense   declined  by   $.8   million   due   to   the
repayment   of   long-term   debt.    The   effective   tax   rate    was
29%   in   both   years   due  to  the  benefits   derived   from   lower
taxed foreign source earnings.

        Net    income   increased   51%   over   1994    due    to    the
operating income gains and lower interest expense.
Liquidity and Capital Resources

        The   Company's   cash   and   cash   equivalents   balance   was
$55.3   million   at   the   end   of   fiscal   1996,   compared    with
$34.4   at   the   end   of   the   prior   year.   Cash   provided    by
operating   activities   was   $68.1   million   in   fiscal   1996,   an
increase   of   $16.2   million   over   the   prior   year,   of   which
approximately    $6    million   resulted   from    tax    refunds    and
interest    received   on   the   favorable   resolution    of    amended
tax return claims of prior years.

         The     Company's    operating    cash    flow    is    strongly
affected    by    the    seasonality    of    its    domestic     college
business     and     receipts    from    its    journal    subscriptions.
Receipts    from    journal   subscriptions   occur   primarily    during
November    and   December   from   companies   commonly   referred    to
as      independent     subscription     agents.      These     companies
facilitate    the    journal    ordering   process    by    consolidating
the      subscription     orders/billings     of     each     subscriber.
Monies    are   collected   in   advance   from   subscribers   by    the
subscription    agents    and    are    remitted    to    the     journal
publishers,   including   the   Company,   generally   prior    to    the
commencement    of    the   subscription.    Remittances    are    highly
dependent    upon    the   financial   position    and    liquidity    of
such companies.

        Sales   to   the   domestic   college   market   tend    to    be
concentrated   in   June   through  August,   and   again   in   November
through    January.     Cash    disbursements    for    inventory     are
relatively    large    during    the   spring    in    anticipation    of
these     college     sales.     The    Company     normally     requires
increased   funds   for   working   capital   from   the   beginning   of
the    fiscal    year    into   September.    Subject    to    variations
that     may     be     caused    by    fluctuations     in     inventory
accumulation    or    in    patterns   of    customer    payments,    the
Company's    normal   operating   cash   flow   is   not   expected    to
vary materially in the near term.

<PAGE>

        To    finance    its   short-term   seasonal   working    capital
requirements   and   its   growth   opportunities,   the   Company    has
adequate   cash   and   cash   equivalents   available,   as   well    as
both   domestic   and   foreign   short-term   lines   of   credit,    as
more    fully    described   in   the   note    to    the    consolidated
financial    statements    entitled    "Notes    Payable    and    Debt".
The    acquisition    of    the   VCH   Publishing    Group    will    be
financed by new debt facilities.

        The    capital    expenditures    of    the    Company    consist
primarily     of     investments    in    product     development     and
property    and    equipment.     Capital   expenditures    for    fiscal
1997   are   expected   to   increase  approximately   10%   over   1996,
primarily     representing    increased    investments     in     product
development,     including     electronic     media     products,     and
computer    equipment   upgrades   to   support   the    higher    volume
of    business    to    ensure    efficient,   quality-driven    customer
service.     These   investments   will   be   funded   primarily    from
internal   cash   generation   or   from   the   liquidation   of    cash
equivalents.

Effects of Inflation and Cost Increases

         Although     the    impact    of    inflation    is     somewhat
minimized,   as   the   business  does   not   require   a   high   level
of   investment   in   property   and   equipment,   the   Company   does
experience    continuing   cost   increases    reflecting,    in    part,
general     inflationary    factors.     Fiscal     1996     and     1995
witnessed   an   increase   in   paper   prices   after   years   of    a
stable    to    decreasing   price   environment.    To   mitigate    the
effects   of   paper   and  other  cost  increases,   the   Company   has
taken   a   number   of   initiatives   including   various   steps    to
lower    overall    production   and   manufacturing   costs    including
substitution   of   paper   grades.    In   addition,   selling    prices
have    been    selectively    increased   as   competitive    conditions
permit.    The   Company   anticipates  that   it   will   be   able   to
continue this approach in the future.

New Accounting Standards

        In    March    1995,    the   Financial   Accounting    Standards
Board    issued    Statement    of   Financial    Accounting    Standards
(SFAS)    No.   121,   "Accounting   for   the   Impairment   of    Long-
lived   Assets   and   for  Long-lived  Assets   to   be   Disposed   Of"
for    fiscal   years   beginning   after   December   15,   1995.    The
Company   intends   to  adopt  SFAS  No.  121  in   fiscal   year   1997,
and   does   not   expect   the   impact  on   its   financial   position
or its results of operations to be material.

        In    October   1995,   the   Financial   Accounting    Standards
Board    issued    SFAS    No.   123,   "Accounting    for    Stock-Based
Compensation"     which     requires     certain     disclosures      for
fiscal   years   beginning   after   December   15,   1995   for    those
companies    that    will   continue   to   use   an   intrinsic    value
based    method   for   measuring   compensation   cost   in   connection
with     employee    stock    compensation    plans.      The     Company
currently    plans    to   continue   to   use   the   intrinsic    value
based   method   and   will   adopt  the   disclosure   requirements   in
fiscal 1997.

        As    of   April   30,   1996,   the   approximate   number    of
holders   of   the   Company's  Class  A  and  Class   B   Common   Stock
were   1,278   and   200,  respectively,  based   on   the   holders   of
record and other information available to the Company.

         The    Company's    revolving    credit    agreements    contain
certain    restrictive   covenants   related   to    the    payment    of
dividends.      Under      the      most      restrictive       covenant,
approximately   $48   million   was  available   for   the   payment   of
future   dividends.    Subject   to   the   foregoing,   the   Board   of
Directors     considers     quarterly     the     payment     of     cash
dividends   based   upon   its   review  of   earnings,   the   financial
position of the Company and other relevant factors.

                        THE CREDITS

           SECTION  2.01.  Commitments to Lend.  During  the
Revolving Credit Period each Bank severally agrees,  on  the
terms and conditions set forth in this Agreement, to lend to
the  Borrower from time to time amounts not to exceed in the
aggregate  at  any one time outstanding the  amount  of  its
Commitment.  Each Borrowing under this Section 2.01 shall be
in an aggregate principal amount of $5,000,000 or any larger
multiple  of $1,000,000 (except that any such Borrowing  may
be  in  the aggregate amount of the unused Commitments)  and
shall  be  made from the several Banks ratably in proportion
to  their  respective  Commitments.   Within  the  foregoing
limits,  the  Borrower may borrow under this  Section  2.01,
repay,  or  to the extent permitted by Section 2.09,  prepay
Loans  and reborrow at any time during the Revolving  Credit
Period under this Section 2.01.

           SECTION  2.02.   Method of Borrowing.   (a)   The
Borrower   shall  give  the  Agent  notice  (a  "Notice   of
Borrowing") not later than 10:30 A.M. (New York  City  time)
on  (i)  the  second Domestic Business Day  before  each  CD
Borrowing,  (ii) the date of each Base Rate  Borrowing,  and
(iii)  the  third  Euro-Dollar  Business  Day  before   each
Euro-Dollar Borrowing, specifying:

           (i)  the date of such Borrowing, which shall
     be  a  Domestic  Business Day in  the  case  of  a
     Domestic  Borrowing or a Euro-Dollar Business  Day
     in the case of a Euro-Dollar Borrowing,

         (ii)  the aggregate amount of such Borrowing,

          (iii)   whether  the  Loans  comprising  such
     Borrowing are to be CD Loans, Base Rate  Loans  or
     Euro-Dollar Loans, and

          (iv)   in the case of a Fixed Rate Borrowing,
     the  duration  of  the Interest Period  applicable
     thereto,   subject  to  the  provisions   of   the
     definition of Interest Period.

           (b)   Upon receipt of a Notice of Borrowing,  the
Agent  shall  promptly  notify each  Bank  of  the  contents
thereof  and of such Bank's ratable share of such  Borrowing
and  such  Notice  of  Borrowing  shall  not  thereafter  be
revocable by the Borrower.
<PAGE>

           (c)   Not  later than 12:00 noon (New  York  City
time) on the date of each Borrowing, each Bank shall (except
as   provided  in  subsection  (d)  of  this  Section)  make
available its ratable share of such Borrowing (determined in
accordance  with Section 2.01), in Federal  or  other  funds
immediately available in New York City, to the Agent at  its
address  specified in or pursuant to Section  9.01.   Unless
the  Agent  determines in its reasonable judgment  that  any
applicable condition specified in Article III has  not  been
satisfied,  the Agent will make the funds so  received  from
the Banks available to the Borrower at the Agent's aforesaid
address.

           (d)  If any Bank makes a new Loan hereunder on  a
day on which the Borrower is to repay all or any part of  an
outstanding Loan from such Bank, such Bank shall  apply  the
proceeds of its new Loan to make such repayment and only  an
amount  equal to the difference (if any) between the  amount
being  borrowed and the amount being repaid  shall  be  made
available  by  such  Bank  to  the  Agent  as  provided   in
subsection (c) of this Section, or remitted by the  Borrower
to  the  Agent as provided in Section 2.10, as the case  may
be.

           (e)   Unless the Agent shall have received notice
from  a  Bank prior to the date of any Borrowing  that  such
Bank  will not make available to the Agent such Bank's share
of  such Borrowing, the Agent may assume that such Bank  has
made  such share available to the Agent on the date of  such
Borrowing in accordance with subsections (c) and (d) of this
Section  2.02  and  the  Agent may, in  reliance  upon  such
assumption,  make available to the Borrower on such  date  a
corresponding amount.  If and to the extent that  such  Bank
shall  not  have so made such share available to the  Agent,
such  Bank and the Borrower severally agree to repay to  the
Agent forthwith on demand such corresponding amount together
with  interest  thereon, for each day  from  the  date  such
amount is made available to the Borrower until the date such
amount  is  repaid to the Agent, at (i) in the case  of  the
Borrower,  a  rate  per annum equal to  the  higher  of  the
Federal  Funds Rate and the interest rate applicable thereto
pursuant to Section 2.05 and (ii) in the case of such  Bank,
the  Federal  Funds Rate.  If such Bank shall repay  to  the
Agent such corresponding amount, such amount so repaid shall
constitute  such Bank's Loan included in such Borrowing  for
purposes of this Agreement.

          SECTION 2.03.  Notes.  (a)  The Loans of each Bank
shall be evidenced by a single Note payable to the order  of
such  Bank for the account of its Applicable Lending  Office
in  an amount equal to the aggregate unpaid principal amount
of such Bank's Loans.
<PAGE>
           (b)  Each Bank may, by notice to the Borrower and
the  Agent, request that its Loans of a particular  type  be
evidenced  by  a  separate Note in an amount  equal  to  the
aggregate unpaid principal amount of such Loans.  Each  such
Note  shall be in substantially the form of Exhibit A hereto
with  appropriate modifications to reflect the fact that  it
evidences solely Loans of the relevant type.  Each reference
in this Agreement to the "Note" of such Bank shall be deemed
to  refer  to and include any or all of such Notes,  as  the
context may require.

           (c)  Upon receipt of each Bank's Note pursuant to
Section  3.01(b), the Agent shall forward such Note to  such
Bank.   Each  Bank shall record the date, amount,  type  and
maturity of each Loan made by it and the date and amount  of
each  payment of principal made by the Borrower with respect
thereto, and may, if such Bank so elects in connection  with
any  transfer  or enforcement of its Note,  endorse  on  the
schedule  forming  a part thereof appropriate  notations  to
evidence the foregoing information with respect to each such
Loan then outstanding; provided that the failure of any Bank
to make any such recordation or endorsement shall not affect
the  obligations  of  the Borrower hereunder  or  under  the
Notes.   Each Bank is hereby irrevocably authorized  by  the
Borrower so to endorse its Note and to attach to and make  a
part of its Note a continuation of any such schedule as  and
when required.

           SECTION  2.04.   Maturity of  Loans.   Each  Loan
included  in  any Borrowing shall mature, and the  principal
amount thereof shall be due and payable, on the last day  of
the  Interest Period applicable to such Borrowing and on the
Termination Date.

           SECTION  2.05.  Interest Rates.  (a)   Each  Base
Rate  Loan  shall bear interest on the outstanding principal
amount thereof, for each day from the date such Loan is made
until it becomes due, at a rate per annum equal to the  Base
Rate  for such day.  Such interest shall be payable for each
Interest  Period  on  the  last day  thereof.   Any  overdue
principal  of  and overdue interest on any  Base  Rate  Loan
shall  bear interest, payable on demand, for each day  until
paid  at  a rate per annum equal to the sum of 1%  plus  the
Base Rate for such day.

outstanding  principal  amount  thereof,  for  the  Interest
Period applicable thereto, at a rate per annum equal to  the
sum of the Applicable Margin plus the applicable Adjusted CD
Rate;  provided that if any CD Loan shall, as  a  result  of
clause (2)(b) of the definition of Interest Period, have  an
Interest  Period of less than 30 days, such  CD  Loan  shall
bear  interest  during  such Interest  Period  at  the  rate
applicable  to  Base Rate Loans during  such  period.   Such
interest  shall be payable for each Interest Period  on  the
last day thereof and, if such Interest Period is longer than
90  days,  at  intervals  of 90 days  after  the  first  day
thereof.   Any overdue principal of and overdue interest  on
any CD Loan shall bear interest, payable on demand, for each
day  until paid at a rate per annum equal to the sum  of  1%
plus the higher of (i) the sum of the Applicable Margin plus
the  Adjusted CD Rate applicable to such Loan and  (ii)  the
Base Rate for such day.

           The "Adjusted CD Rate" applicable to any Interest
Period  means  a rate per annum determined pursuant  to  the
following formula:

                   [ 1.00 - DRP ]

         ACDR   =  Adjusted CD Rate
         CDBR   =  CD Base Rate
          DRP   =  Domestic Reserve Percentage
          AR    =  Assessment Rate

     __________
     *  The amount in brackets being rounded upwards, if

Period is the rate of interest determined by the Agent to be
the  prevailing rate per annum bid at 10:00 A.M.  (New  York
City  time)  (or as soon thereafter as practicable)  on  the
first  day of such Interest Period by two or more  New  York
certificate  of deposit dealers of recognized  standing  for
the  purchase  at face value from Morgan of its certificates
of  deposit in an amount comparable to the unpaid  principal

Period  applies  and  having a maturity comparable  to  such
Interest Period.

limitation  any  basic, supplemental or emergency  reserves)
for  a member bank of the Federal Reserve System in New York
City with deposits exceeding five billion dollars in respect
of  new  non-personal time deposits in dollars in  New  York
City  having  a maturity comparable to the related  Interest

Percentage.

assessment rate in effect on such day which is payable by  a

applicable  to  any Interest Period means a rate  per  annum
equal   to  the  quotient  obtained  (rounded  upwards,   if

(ii) 1.00 minus the Euro-Dollar Reserve Percentage.

any  Interest  Period  means the rate  per  annum  at  which
deposits  in  dollars are offered to Morgan  in  the  London

such  Interest Period is to apply and for a period  of  time
comparable to such Interest Period.

liabilities"  (or  in  respect  of  any  other  category  of

the  interest rate on Euro-Dollar Loans is determined or any
category  of  extensions of credit  or  other  assets  which
includes loans by a non-United States office of any Bank  to
United  States  residents).  The Adjusted  London  Interbank
Offered  Rate shall be adjusted automatically on and  as  of
the  effective date of any change in the Euro-Dollar Reserve
Percentage.

          (d)  Any overdue principal of and overdue interest
on  any  Euro-Dollar  Loan shall bear interest,  payable  on
demand,  for  each day from and including the  date  payment
thereof was due to but excluding the date of actual payment,
at  a  rate per annum equal to the sum of 1% plus the higher
of  (i)  the sum of the Applicable Margin plus the  Adjusted
London  Interbank Offered Rate applicable to such  Loan  and
(ii)  the  Applicable  Margin  plus  the  quotient  obtained
(rounded upwards, if necessary, to the next higher 1/100  of
1%) by dividing (x) the rate per annum at which one day (or,
if   such   amount  due  remains  unpaid  more  than   three
Euro-Dollar  Business Days, then for such  other  period  of
time  not  longer than six months as the Agent  may  select)
deposits in dollars in an amount approximately equal to such
overdue payment due to Morgan are offered to Morgan  in  the
London interbank market for the applicable period determined
as  provided above by (y) 1.00 minus the Euro-Dollar Reserve
Percentage (or, if the circumstances described in clause (a)
or  (b)  of  Section 8.01 shall exist, at a rate  per  annum
equal to the sum of 1% plus the Base Rate for such day).

Loan outstanding on any day during any fiscal quarter of the
Borrower is (i) for each day during any fiscal quarter as to

fiscal quarter, and an appropriate adjustment shall be  made
within  three Domestic Business Days after the  delivery  of
such  certificate for any resulting change in the amount  of
interest accrued from such first day and previously paid.

           (f)  The Agent shall determine each interest rate
applicable  to  the Loans hereunder.  The Agent  shall  give
prompt notice to the Borrower and the Banks of each rate  of
interest so determined, and its determination thereof  shall
be conclusive in the absence of manifest error.

            SECTION  2.06.   Facility  Fees.    During   the
Revolving  Credit  Period, the Borrower  shall  pay  to  the
Agent,  for  the account of the Banks ratably in  accordance
with  their respective Commitments, a facility fee for  each
day  at a rate per annum equal to (i) 0.125% for any day  on
which  Level  I  (as  such term is  used  in  Section  2.05)
applies, (ii) 0.175% for any day on which Level II (as  such
term  is used in Section 2.05) applies, and (iii) 0.25%  for
any  day on which Level III (as such term is used in Section
2.05)  applies,  on the aggregate amount of the  Commitments
(whether  used  or unused) on such day.  Such facility  fees
shall  accrue for each day from and including the  Effective
Date  to but excluding the Termination Date (or earlier date
of  termination  of  the  Commitments  in  their  entirety).
Accrued  fees under this Section shall be payable  quarterly
in  arrears  on  each March 31, June 30,  September  30  and
December  31 during the Revolving Credit Period and  on  the
Termination  Date  (or earlier date of  termination  of  the
Commitments in their entirety).

           SECTION  2.07.  Optional Termination or Reduction
of  Commitments.   During the Revolving Credit  Period,  the
Borrower  may,  upon at least three Domestic Business  Days'
notice   to   the   Agent,  terminate  at   any   time,   or
proportionately  reduce from time to time  by  an  aggregate
amount  of $10,000,000 or any larger multiple of $1,000,000,
the  unused portions of the Commitments.  If the Commitments
are terminated in their entirety, all accrued fees shall  be
payable on the effective date of such termination.
<PAGE>
             SECTION   2.08.    Mandatory   Termination   of
Commitments.   The  Commitments  shall  terminate   on   the
Termination  Date  and any Loans then outstanding  (together
with  accrued interest thereon) shall be due and payable  on
such date.

           SECTION  2.09.  Optional Prepayments.   (a)   The
Borrower  may,  upon  at least one Domestic  Business  Day's
notice to the Agent, prepay any Base Rate Borrowing in whole
at  any  time,  or  from time to time  in  part  in  amounts
aggregating $1,000,000 or any larger multiple of $1,000,000,
by  paying the principal amount to be prepaid together  with
accrued  interest  thereon to the date of prepayment.   Each
such  optional prepayment shall be applied to prepay ratably
the Loans of the several Banks included in such Borrowing.

           (b)   Except  as  provided in Section  8.02,  the
Borrower  may not prepay all or any portion of the principal
amount of any Fixed Rate Loan prior to the maturity thereof.

           (c)   Upon  receipt  of  a notice  of  prepayment
pursuant  to  this Section, the Agent shall promptly  notify
each Bank of the contents thereof and of such Bank's ratable
share   of  such  prepayment  and  such  notice  shall   not
thereafter be revocable by the Borrower.

           SECTION 2.10.  General Provisions as to Payments.
(a)   The Borrower shall make each payment of principal  of,
and  interest on, the Loans and of facility fees  hereunder,
not  later than 12:00 noon (New York City time) on the  date
when due, in Federal or other funds immediately available in
New  York City, to the Agent at its address referred  to  in
Section  9.01.  The Agent will promptly distribute  to  each
Bank its ratable share of each such payment received by  the
Agent for the account of the Banks.  Whenever any payment of
principal  of,  or  interest on, the Domestic  Loans  or  of
facility  fees shall be due on a day which is not a Domestic
Business Day, the date for payment thereof shall be extended
to  the next succeeding Domestic Business Day.  Whenever any
payment  of  principal of, or interest on,  the  Euro-Dollar
Loans  shall  be  due on a day which is  not  a  Euro-Dollar
Business Day, the date for payment thereof shall be extended
to  the next succeeding Euro-Dollar Business Day unless such
Euro-Dollar Business Day falls in another calendar month, in
which  case the date for payment thereof shall be  the  next
preceding  Euro-Dollar Business Day.  If the  date  for  any
payment  of  principal is extended by operation  of  law  or
otherwise,  interest  thereon  shall  be  payable  for  such
extended time.
<PAGE>

           (b)   Unless the Agent shall have received notice
from the Borrower prior to the date on which any payment  is
due  to the Banks hereunder that the Borrower will not  make
such payment in full, the Agent may assume that the Borrower
has  made such payment in full to the Agent on such date and
the Agent may, in reliance upon such assumption, cause to be
distributed to each Bank on such due date an amount equal to
the  amount  then due such Bank.  If and to the extent  that
the  Borrower shall not have so made such payment, each Bank
shall  repay  to the Agent forthwith on demand  such  amount
distributed to such Bank together with interest thereon, for
each  day from the date such amount is distributed  to  such
Bank  until  the date such Bank repays such  amount  to  the
Agent, at the Federal Funds Rate.

           SECTION  2.11.  Funding Losses.  If the  Borrower
makes  any  payment of principal with respect to  any  Fixed
Rate  Loan (pursuant to Article VI or VIII or otherwise)  on
any  day  other  than  the last day of the  Interest  Period
applicable thereto, or the end of an applicable period fixed
pursuant  to  Section 2.05(d), or if the Borrower  fails  to
borrow  any Fixed Rate Loans after notice has been given  to
any  Bank  in accordance with Section 2.02(b), the  Borrower
shall  reimburse each Bank within 15 days after  demand  for
any  resulting  loss or expense incurred by  it  (or  by  an
existing  or  prospective Participant in the related  Loan),
including   (without  limitation)  any  loss   incurred   in
obtaining,  liquidating  or employing  deposits  from  third
parties,  but excluding loss of margin for the period  after
any  such  payment or failure to borrow, provided that  such
Bank  shall have delivered to the Borrower a certificate  as
to  the  amount  of such loss or expense, which  certificate
shall be conclusive in the absence of manifest error.

           SECTION 2.12.  Computation of Interest and  Fees.
Interest based on the Prime Rate hereunder and facility fees
shall be computed on the basis of a year of 365 days (or 366
days  in a leap year) and paid for the actual number of days
elapsed  (including  the first day but  excluding  the  last
day).  All other interest shall be computed on the basis  of
a  year  of 360 days and paid for the actual number of  days
elapsed  (including  the first day but  excluding  the  last
day).
<PAGE>
           SECTION  2.13.  Withholding Tax .  At least  five
Domestic  Business  Days prior to the first  date  on  which
interest  or fees are payable hereunder for the  account  of
any  Bank, each Bank that is not incorporated under the laws
of  the  United States of America or a state thereof  agrees
that  it will deliver to each of the Borrower and the  Agent
two  duly completed copies of United States Internal Revenue
Service  Form 1001 or 4224, certifying in either  case  that
such  Bank  is  entitled  to  receive  payments  under  this
Agreement and the Notes without deduction or withholding  of
any United States federal income taxes.  Each Bank which  so
delivers  a Form 1001 or 4224 further undertakes to  deliver
to  each of the Borrower and the Agent two additional copies
of  such  form (or a successor form) on or before  the  date
that  such  form expires or becomes obsolete  or  after  the
occurrence  of  any  event requiring a change  in  the  most
recent  form so delivered by it, and such amendments thereto
or  extensions  or  renewals thereof as  may  be  reasonably
requested  by  the  Borrower or  the  Agent,  in  each  case
certifying  that  such Bank is entitled to receive  payments
under  this  Agreement  and the Notes without  deduction  or
withholding  of  any  United States  federal  income  taxes,
unless an event (including without limitation any change  in
treaty, law or regulation) has occurred prior to the date on
which  any  such delivery would otherwise be required  which
renders  all such forms inapplicable or which would  prevent
such  Bank from duly completing and delivering any such form
with  respect  to it and such Bank advises the Borrower  and
the  Agent  that  it  is not capable of  receiving  payments
without  any  deduction  or  withholding  of  United  States
federal income tax.

           SECTION 2.14.  Change of Control.  If a Change of
Control shall occur (i) the Borrower will, promptly  and  in
any  event within 20 days after the occurrence thereof, give
each  Bank  notice thereof and shall describe in  reasonable
detail  the facts and circumstances giving rise thereto  and
(ii)  each Bank may, by notice to the Borrower and the Agent
given not later than 20 days after such notice of Change  of
Control  shall  have been given, terminate  its  Commitment,
which  shall  be  terminated 45 days after  such  notice  of
Change  of  Control shall have been given, and  declare  the
Note held by it, together with accrued interest thereon, and
any  other amounts payable hereunder for its account to  be,
and such Note and such other amounts shall thereupon become,
due and payable on such forty-fifth day without presentment,
demand,  protest or other notice of any kind, all  of  which
are  hereby  waived by the Borrower; provided that  no  Bank
shall be obligated, without its written consent given at the
time,  to make a Loan to be included in any Borrowing  other
than  a  Refunding  Borrowing during  the  period  from  and
including  the  date of any such Change of  Control  to  and
including  the  forty-fifth day  following  such  notice  of
Change of Control.

a  reasonable possibility of an adverse decision which could
materially   adversely  affect  the  business,  consolidated
financial position or consolidated results of operations  of

     of $10,000,000; or

           (i)  a judgment or order for the payment of money
     in  excess of $1,000,000 shall be rendered against  the
     Borrower  or any Subsidiary and such judgment or  order
     shall continue unsatisfied and unstayed for a period of
     30 days;
<PAGE>

then,  and  in  every  such event, the Agent  shall  (i)  if
requested  by  Banks having more than 66 2/3%  in  aggregate
amount  of  the  Commitments,  by  notice  to  the  Borrower
terminate   the   Commitments  and  they   shall   thereupon
terminate,  and  (ii)  if requested by Banks  holding  Notes
evidencing  more than 66 2/3% in aggregate principal  amount
of  the  Loans, by notice to the Borrower declare the  Notes
(together  with  accrued interest thereon) to  be,  and  the
Notes  shall  thereupon become, immediately due and  payable
without presentment, demand, protest or other notice of  any
kind,  all  of  which  are hereby waived  by  the  Borrower;
provided  that in the case of any of the Events  of  Default
specified  in  clause (f) or (g) above with respect  to  the
Borrower,  without any notice to the Borrower or  any  other
act  by  the  Agent  or  the Banks,  the  Commitments  shall
thereupon  terminate  and the Notes (together  with  accrued
interest  thereon) shall become immediately due and  payable
without presentment, demand, protest or other notice of  any
kind, all of which are hereby waived by the Borrower.

          SECTION 6.02.  Notice of Default.  The Agent shall
give  notice to the Borrower under Section 6.01(c)  promptly
upon  being  requested  to  do so  by  any  Bank  and  shall
thereupon notify all the Banks thereof.

                        ARTICLE VII

                         THE AGENT

           SECTION  7.01.   Appointment  and  .   Each  Bank
irrevocably appoints and authorizes the Agent to  take  such
action  as  agent on its behalf and to exercise such  powers
under  this Agreement and the Notes as are delegated to  the
Agent by the terms hereof or thereof, together with all such
powers as are reasonably incidental thereto.

           SECTION 7.02.  Agent and Affiliates.  Morgan  and
its  affiliates may accept deposits from, lend money to, and
generally  engage in any kind of business with the  Borrower
or any Subsidiary or affiliate of the Borrower as if it were
not the Agent hereunder.

           SECTION  7.03.  Action by Agent.  The obligations
of  the  Agent hereunder are only those expressly set  forth
herein.   Without limiting the generality of the  foregoing,
the  Agent  shall  not be required to take any  action  with
respect  to  any  Default, except as expressly  provided  in
Article VI.
<PAGE>

           SECTION  7.04.  Consultation with  Experts.   The
Agent may consult with legal counsel (who may be counsel for
the  Borrower),  independent public  accountants  and  other
experts  selected  by it and shall not  be  liable  for  any
action  taken or omitted to be taken by it in good faith  in
accordance  with the advice of such counsel, accountants  or
experts.

           SECTION  7.05.  Liability of Agent.  Neither  the
Agent  nor any of its affiliates nor any of their respective
directors, officers, agents or employees shall be liable for
any  action taken or not taken by it in connection  herewith
(i) with the consent or at the request of the Required Banks
or  (ii)  in  the  absence of its own  gross  negligence  or
willful  misconduct.   Neither the  Agent  nor  any  of  its
affiliates nor any of their respective directors,  officers,
agents  or  employees shall be responsible for or  have  any
duty to ascertain, inquire into or verify (i) any statement,
warranty  or  representation made in  connection  with  this
Agreement  or any borrowing hereunder; (ii) the  performance
or  observance of any of the covenants or agreements of  the
Borrower;  (iii) the satisfaction of any condition specified
in  Article  III,  except receipt of items  required  to  be
delivered  to the Agent; or (iv) the validity, effectiveness
or  genuineness of this Agreement, the Notes  or  any  other
instrument or writing furnished in connection herewith.  The
Agent  shall  not incur any liability by acting in  reliance
upon  any notice, consent, certificate, statement, or  other
writing  (which  may  be a bank wire,  telex,  facsimile  or
similar  writing)  believed by it to be  genuine  or  to  be
signed by the proper party or parties.

           SECTION  7.06..   Each  Bank  shall,  ratably  in
accordance  with its Commitment, indemnify  the  Agent,  its
affiliates and their respective directors, officers,  agents
and employees (to the extent not reimbursed by the Borrower)
against  any  cost,  expense  (including  counsel  fees  and
disbursements),  claim, demand, action,  loss  or  liability
(except   such  as  result  from  such  indemnitees'   gross
negligence or willful misconduct) that such indemnitees  may
suffer  or  incur in connection with this Agreement  or  any
action taken or omitted by such indemnitees hereunder.

            SECTION  7.07.   Credit  Decision.   Each   Bank
acknowledges that it has, independently and without reliance
upon  the  Agent  or  any  other Bank,  and  based  on  such
documents and information as it has deemed appropriate, made
its  own  credit  analysis and decision to enter  into  this
Agreement.   Each  Bank  also  acknowledges  that  it  will,
independently  and without reliance upon the  Agent  or  any
other  Bank, and based on such documents and information  as
it  shall deem appropriate at the time, continue to make its
own  credit  decisions in taking or not  taking  any  action
under this Agreement.
<PAGE>

          SECTION 7.08.  Successor.  The Agent may resign at
any  time  by  giving notice thereof to the  Banks  and  the
Borrower.   Upon  any such resignation, the  Required  Banks
shall  have the right, subject to approval by the  Borrower,
to appoint a successor Agent, provided that approval of such
successor  Agent  by the Borrower shall not be  unreasonably
withheld.   If  no  successor  Agent  shall  have  been   so
appointed  by  the Required Banks, and shall  have  accepted
such  appointment, within 30 days after the  retiring  Agent
gives notice of resignation, then the retiring Agent may, on
behalf of the Banks, appoint a successor Agent, which  shall
be a commercial bank organized or licensed under the laws of
the  United  States of America or of any State  thereof  and
having   a   combined  capital  and  surplus  of  at   least
$50,000,000.   Upon  the acceptance of  its  appointment  as
Agent  hereunder by a successor Agent, such successor  Agent
shall  thereupon succeed to and become vested with  all  the
rights  and  duties of the retiring Agent, and the  retiring
Agent  shall  be discharged from its duties and  obligations
hereunder.  After any retiring Agent's resignation hereunder
as  Agent, the provisions of this Article shall inure to its
benefit as to any actions taken or omitted to be taken by it
while it was Agent.

           SECTION  7.09.  Agent's Fee.  The Borrower  shall
pay to the Agent for its own account fees in the amounts and
at the times previously agreed upon between the Borrower and
the Agent.

                        ARTICLE VIII

                  CHANGE IN CIRCUMSTANCES

          SECTION 8.01.  Basis for Determining Interest Rate
Inadequate  or Unfair.  If on or prior to the first  day  of
any Interest Period for any Fixed Rate Borrowing:

           (a)   the  Agent is advised by  Morgan  that
     deposits  in  dollars (in the applicable  amounts)
     are  not  being offered to Morgan in the  relevant
     market for such Interest Period, or

            (b)   Banks  having  50%  or  more  of  the
     aggregate  amount  of the Commitments  advise  the
     Agent  that  the Adjusted CD Rate or the  Adjusted
     London Interbank Offered Rate, as the case may be,
     as determined by the Agent will not adequately and
     fairly  reflect the cost to such Banks of  funding
     their  CD Loans or Euro-Dollar Loans, as the  case
     may be, for such Interest Period,
<PAGE>

the  Agent  shall  forthwith  give  notice  thereof  to  the
Borrower  and the Banks, whereupon until the Agent  notifies
the  Borrower  that the circumstances giving  rise  to  such
suspension no longer exist, the obligations of the Banks  to
make  CD  Loans or Euro-Dollar Loans, as the  case  may  be,
shall  be suspended.  Unless the Borrower notifies the Agent
at  least two Domestic Business Days before the date of  any
Fixed  Rate  Borrowing for which a Notice of  Borrowing  has
previously been given that it elects not to borrow  on  such
date,  such Borrowing shall instead be made as a  Base  Rate
Borrowing.

           SECTION  8.02.  Illegality.  If, on or after  the
date  of this Agreement, the adoption of any applicable law,
rule  or  regulation, or any change in any  applicable  law,
rule  or regulation, or any change in the interpretation  or
administration   thereof  by  any  governmental   authority,
central   bank  or  comparable  agency  charged   with   the
interpretation or administration thereof, or  compliance  by
any  Bank  (or  its  Euro-Dollar Lending  Office)  with  any
request  or  directive (whether or not having the  force  of
law)  of  any  such  authority, central bank  or  comparable
agency shall make it unlawful or impossible for any Bank (or
its  Euro-Dollar Lending Office) to make, maintain  or  fund
its  Euro-Dollar  Loans and such Bank shall  so  notify  the
Agent, the Agent shall forthwith give notice thereof to  the
other  Banks  and  the Borrower, whereupon until  such  Bank
notifies  the  Borrower and the Agent that the circumstances
giving  rise  to  such  suspension  no  longer  exist,   the
obligation of such Bank to make Euro-Dollar Loans  shall  be
suspended.   Before giving any notice to the Agent  pursuant
to  this  Section,  such  Bank shall designate  a  different
Euro-Dollar  Lending Office if such designation  will  avoid
the  need  for  giving  such notice and  will  not,  in  the
judgment of such Bank, be otherwise disadvantageous to  such
Bank.  If such Bank shall determine that it may not lawfully
continue  to  maintain  and  fund  any  of  its  outstanding
Euro-Dollar Loans to maturity and shall so specify  in  such
notice,  the Borrower shall immediately prepay in  full  the
then  outstanding principal amount of each such  Euro-Dollar
Loan,  together with accrued interest thereon.  Concurrently
with  prepaying  each such Euro-Dollar  Loan,  the  Borrower
shall  borrow a Base Rate Loan in an equal principal  amount
from  such  Bank (on which interest and principal  shall  be
payable contemporaneously with the related Euro-Dollar Loans
of  the  other Banks), and such Bank shall make such a  Base
Rate Loan.
<PAGE>

           SECTION 8.03.  Increased Cost and Reduced Return.
(a)   If  on or after the date hereof, the adoption  of  any
applicable  law, rule or regulation, or any  change  in  any
applicable  law, rule or regulation, or any  change  in  the
interpretation or administration thereof by any governmental
authority,  central bank or comparable agency  charged  with
the  interpretation or administration thereof, or compliance
by  any  Bank  (or its Applicable Lending Office)  with  any
request  or  directive (whether or not having the  force  of
law)  of  any  such  authority, central bank  or  comparable
agency:

            (i)    shall  subject  any  Bank  (or   its
     Applicable  Lending Office) to any  tax,  duty  or
     other charge with respect to its Fixed Rate Loans,
     its  Notes  or its obligation to make  Fixed  Rate
     Loans,  or  shall change the basis of taxation  of
     payments  to  any Bank (or its Applicable  Lending
     Office)  of  the principal of or interest  on  its
     Fixed  Rate Loans or any other amounts  due  under
     this  Agreement in respect of its Fixed Rate Loans
     or its obligation to make Fixed Rate Loans (except
     for  changes in the rate of tax on the overall net
     income  of  such  Bank or its  Applicable  Lending
     Office  imposed by the jurisdiction in which  such
     Bank's  principal executive office  or  Applicable
     Lending Office is located); or

          (ii)  shall impose, modify or deem applicable
     any    reserve,   special   deposit   or   similar
     requirement  (including, without  limitation,  any
     such requirement imposed by the Board of Governors
     of  the  Federal  Reserve  System,  but  excluding
     (A)   with  respect  to  any  CD  Loan  any   such
     requirement  included  in an  applicable  Domestic
     Reserve  Percentage and (B) with  respect  to  any
     Euro-Dollar Loan any such requirement included  in
     an   applicable  Euro-Dollar  Reserve  Percentage)
     against  assets  of,  deposits  with  or  for  the
     account  of, or credit extended by, any  Bank  (or
     its Applicable Lending Office) or shall impose  on
     any Bank (or its Applicable Lending Office) or  on
     the  United  States  market  for  certificates  of
     deposit  or the London interbank market any  other
     condition  affecting  its Fixed  Rate  Loans,  its
     Notes or its obligation to make Fixed Rate Loans;
<PAGE>

and  the  result of any of the foregoing is to increase  the
cost  to  such  Bank (or its Applicable Lending  Office)  of
making or maintaining any Fixed Rate Loan, or to reduce  the
amount  of any sum received or receivable by such  Bank  (or
its Applicable Lending Office) under this Agreement or under
its  Notes with respect thereto, by an amount deemed by such
Bank  to  be material, then, within 15 days after demand  by
such Bank (with a copy to the Agent), the Borrower shall pay
to  such  Bank  such additional amount or  amounts  as  will
compensate such Bank for such increased cost or reduction.

          (b)  If any Bank shall have determined that, after
the date hereof, the adoption of any applicable law, rule or
regulation regarding capital adequacy, or any change in  any
such  law,  rule  or  regulation,  or  any  change  in   the
interpretation or administration thereof by any governmental
authority,  central bank or comparable agency  charged  with
the interpretation or administration thereof, or any request
or  directive  regarding capital adequacy  (whether  or  not
having the force of law) of any such authority, central bank
or  comparable  agency,  has or would  have  the  effect  of
reducing the rate of return on capital of such Bank (or  its
Parent)   as   a  consequence  of  such  Bank's  obligations
hereunder  to  a level below that which such  Bank  (or  its
Parent) could have achieved but for such adoption, change or
compliance  (taking  into consideration  its  policies  with
respect  to  capital adequacy) by an amount deemed  by  such
Bank  to be material, then from time to time, within 15 days
after  demand by such Bank (with a copy to the  Agent),  the
Borrower  shall pay to such Bank such additional  amount  or
amounts  as  will compensate such Bank (or its  Parent)  for
such reduction.

           (c)   Each Bank will promptly notify the Borrower
and  the  Agent  of  any event of which  it  has  knowledge,
occurring  after  the date hereof, which will  entitle  such
Bank  to  compensation  pursuant to this  Section  and  will
designate  a  different Applicable Lending  Office  if  such
designation  will avoid the need for, or reduce  the  amount
of,  such compensation and will not, in the judgment of such
Bank,   be  otherwise  disadvantageous  to  such  Bank.    A
certificate  of  any Bank claiming compensation  under  this
Section  and setting forth the additional amount or  amounts
to  be  paid  to  it  hereunder shall be conclusive  in  the
absence of manifest error.  In determining such amount, such
Bank  may  use  any  reasonable  averaging  and  attribution
methods.
<PAGE>

           SECTION  8.04.   Base Rate Loans Substituted  for
Affected  Fixed  Rate Loans.  If (i) the obligation  of  any
Bank  to  make Euro-Dollar Loans has been suspended pursuant
to  Section  8.02 or (ii) any Bank has demanded compensation
under  Section 8.03(a) and the Borrower shall, by  at  least
five  Euro-Dollar Business Days' prior notice to  such  Bank
through the Agent, have elected that the provisions of  this
Section  shall  apply to such Bank, then, unless  and  until
such  Bank  notifies  the  Borrower that  the  circumstances
giving rise to such suspension or demand for compensation no
longer apply:

           (a)  all Loans which would otherwise be made
     by  such Bank as CD Loans or Euro-Dollar Loans, as
     the  case  may be, shall be made instead  as  Base
     Rate  Loans (on which interest and principal shall
     be  payable  contemporaneously  with  the  related
     Fixed Rate Loans of the other Banks), and

            (b)    after  each  of  its  CD  Loans   or
     Euro-Dollar  Loans, as the case may be,  has  been
     repaid,  all  payments  of principal  which  would
     otherwise  be  applied to repay  such  Fixed  Rate
     Loans  shall  be applied to repay  its  Base  Rate
     Loans instead.

                         ARTICLE IX

                       MISCELLANEOUS

           SECTION  9.01.  All notices, requests  and  other
communications to any party hereunder shall  be  in  writing
(including  bank  wire,  telex,  facsimile  transmission  or
similar writing) and shall be given to such party:   (x)  in
the  case  of the Borrower or the Agent, at its  address  or
facsimile  number set forth on the signature  pages  hereof,
(y)  in  the  case of any Bank, at its address or  telex  or
facsimile   number   set   forth   in   its   Administrative
Questionnaire  or (z) in the case of any party,  such  other
address  or  telex  or facsimile number as  such  party  may
hereafter specify for the purpose by notice to the Agent and
the   Borrower.    Each  such  notice,  request   or   other
communication shall be effective (i) if given by telex, when
such  telex is transmitted to the telex number specified  in
this  Section  and the appropriate answerback  is  received,
(ii) if given by mail, 72 hours after such communication  is
deposited  in  the  mails with first class postage  prepaid,
addressed as aforesaid or (iii) if given by any other means,
when  received  at  the address specified in  this  Section;
provided  that  notices to the Agent  under  Article  II  or
Article VIII shall not be effective until received.

           SECTION  9.02.  No.  No failure or delay  by  the
Agent  or  any  Bank  in  exercising  any  right,  power  or
privilege  hereunder or under any Note shall  operate  as  a
waiver  thereof  nor  shall any single or  partial  exercise
thereof  preclude any other or further exercise  thereof  or
the  exercise  of any other right, power or privilege.   The
rights and remedies herein provided shall be cumulative  and
not exclusive of any rights or remedies provided by law.

            SECTION  9.03.   Expenses;  Documentary   Taxes;
Indemnification.   (a)   The  Borrower  shall  pay  (i)  all
out-of-pocket  expenses  of the Agent,  including  fees  and
disbursements   of  special  counsel  for  the   Agent,   in
connection  with  the  preparation of  this  Agreement,  any
waiver  or consent hereunder or any amendment hereof or  any
Default or alleged Default hereunder and (ii) if an Event of
Default occurs, all out-of-pocket expenses incurred  by  the
Agent  or  any  Bank,  including fees and  disbursements  of
counsel,  in  connection  with such  Event  of  Default  and
collection  and  other  enforcement  proceedings   resulting
therefrom.   The Borrower shall indemnify each Bank  against
any  transfer  taxes,  documentary  taxes,  assessments   or
charges made by any governmental authority by reason of  the
execution and delivery of this Agreement or the Notes.
<PAGE>

           (b)   The Borrower agrees to indemnify the  Agent
and   each  Bank,  their  respective  affiliates   and   the
respective directors, officers, agents and employees of  the
foregoing  (each  an "Indemnitee") and hold each  Indemnitee
harmless  from  and against any and all damages,  costs  and
expenses  of  any  kind (including, without limitation,  the
reasonable  fees  and  disbursements  of  counsel  for   any
Indemnitee    in    connection   with   any   investigative,
administrative or judicial proceeding, whether or  not  such
Indemnitee shall be designated a party thereto) which may be
incurred  by any Indemnitee, relating to or arising  out  of
this Agreement or any actual or proposed use of proceeds  of
Loans hereunder; provided that no Indemnitee shall have  the
right   to  be  indemnified  hereunder  for  its  own  gross
negligence or willful misconduct as determined by a court of
competent  jurisdiction.  The Borrower shall not  be  liable
for  any settlement effected without the Borrower's consent,
which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld.

           SECTION 9.04.  Sharing of Set-.  Each Bank agrees
that  if  it  shall, by exercising any right of  set-off  or
counterclaim  or otherwise, receive payment of a  proportion
of  the aggregate amount of principal and interest due  with
respect  to  any Note held by it which is greater  than  the
proportion  received by any other Bank  in  respect  of  the
aggregate amount of principal and interest due with  respect
to any Note held by such other Bank, the Bank receiving such
proportionately   greater  payment   shall   purchase   such
participation in the Notes held by the other Banks, and such
other adjustments shall be made, as may be required so  that
all such payments of principal and interest with respect  to
the Notes held by the Banks shall be shared by the Banks pro
rata; provided that nothing in this Section shall impair the
right  of  any  Bank  to exercise any right  of  set-off  or
counterclaim it may have and to apply the amount subject  to
such exercise to the payment of indebtedness of the Borrower
other  than its indebtedness under the Notes.  The  Borrower
agrees, to the fullest extent it may effectively do so under
applicable  law,  that any holder of a  participation  in  a
Note,  whether  or  not acquired pursuant to  the  foregoing
arrangements, may exercise rights of set-off or counterclaim
and other rights with respect to such participation as fully
as  if such holder of a participation were a direct creditor
of the Borrower in the amount of such participation.
<PAGE>

            SECTION  9.05.   Amendments  and  Waivers.   Any
provision  of this Agreement or the Notes may be amended  or
waived  if,  but  only if, such amendment or  waiver  is  in
writing and is signed by the Borrower and the Required Banks
(and,  if  the  rights or duties of the Agent  are  affected
thereby,  by the Agent); provided that no such amendment  or
waiver  shall, unless signed by all the Banks, (i)  increase
or decrease the Commitment of any Bank (except for a ratable
decrease  in  the Commitments of all Banks) or  subject  any
Bank to any additional obligation, (ii) reduce the principal
of, accrued interest on, or rate of interest on, any Loan or
any  fees hereunder, (iii) postpone the date fixed  for  any
payment of principal of or interest on any Loan or any  fees
hereunder  or  the  Termination  Date  or  (iv)  change  the
percentage  of  the Commitments or of the  aggregate  unpaid
principal amount of the Notes, or the number of Banks, which
shall  be required for the Banks or any of them to take  any
action  under  this Section or any other provision  of  this
Agreement.

           SECTION 9.06.  Successors and Assigns.  (a)   The
provisions of this Agreement shall be binding upon and inure
to  the  benefit of the parties hereto and their  respective
successors  and  assigns, except that the Borrower  may  not
assign  or  otherwise transfer any of its rights under  this
Agreement without the prior written consent of all Banks.

          (b)  Any Bank may at any time grant to one or more
banks   or   other   institutions  (each  a   "Participant")
participating interests in its Commitment or any or  all  of
its  Loans.  In the event of any such grant by a Bank  of  a
participating interest to a Participant, whether or not upon
notice to the Borrower and the Agent, such Bank shall remain
responsible   for   the  performance  of   its   obligations
hereunder, and the Borrower and the Agent shall continue  to
deal  solely and directly with such Bank in connection  with
such  Bank's  rights and obligations under  this  Agreement.
Any  agreement pursuant to which any Bank may grant  such  a
participating  interest shall provide that such  Bank  shall
retain  the  sole right and responsibility  to  enforce  the
obligations  of  the  Borrower hereunder including,  without
limitation, the right to approve any amendment, modification
or  waiver of any provision of this Agreement; provided that
such participation agreement may provide that such Bank will
not  agree to any modification, amendment or waiver of  this
Agreement described in clause (i), (ii) or (iii) of  Section
9.05  without the consent of the Participant.  The  Borrower
agrees  that each Participant shall, to the extent  provided
in  its participation agreement, be entitled to the benefits
of  Article VIII with respect to its participating interest.
An  assignment or other transfer which is not  permitted  by
subsection  (c)  or  (d) below shall  be  given  effect  for
purposes  of  this  Agreement  only  to  the  extent  of   a
participating  interest  granted  in  accordance  with  this
subsection (b).
<PAGE>

           (c)   Any Bank may at any time assign to  one  or
more  banks or other institutions (each an "Assignee")  all,
or   a  proportionate  part  of  all,  of  its  rights   and
obligations  under this Agreement and the  Notes,  and  such
Assignee  shall assume such rights and obligations, pursuant
to   an  instrument  executed  by  such  Assignee  and  such
transferor Bank, with notice to the Borrower and subject  to
the  subscribed consent of the Agent; provided  that  if  an
Assignee  is an affiliate of such transferor Bank,  no  such
consent  shall  be required; and provided further  that  any
assignment  shall not be less than $5,000,000, or  if  less,
shall  constitute an assignment of all of such Bank's rights
and  obligations under this Agreement and the  Notes.   Upon
execution and delivery of such an instrument and payment  by
such Assignee to such transferor Bank of an amount equal  to
the  purchase price agreed between such transferor Bank  and
such  Assignee, such Assignee shall be a Bank party to  this
Agreement and shall have all the rights and obligations of a
Bank  with  a Commitment as set forth in such instrument  of
assumption,  and the transferor Bank shall be released  from
its obligations hereunder to a corresponding extent, and  no
further  consent or action by any party shall  be  required.
Upon  the  consummation of any assignment pursuant  to  this
subsection  (c),  the transferor Bank,  the  Agent  and  the
Borrower  shall make appropriate arrangements  so  that,  if
required,  a  new  Note is issued to the Assignee.   If  the
Assignee  is not incorporated under the laws of  the  United
States of America or a state thereof, it shall, prior to the
first  date on which interest or fees are payable  hereunder
for  its  account,  deliver to the Borrower  and  the  Agent
certification as to exemption from deduction or  withholding
of any United States federal income taxes in accordance with
Section 2.13.

           (d)   Any Bank may at any time assign all or  any
portion of its rights under this Agreement and its Note to a
Federal Reserve Bank.  No such assignment shall release  the
transferor Bank from its obligations hereunder.

           (e)  No Assignee, Participant or other transferee
of  any  Bank's  rights  shall be entitled  to  receive  any
greater payment under Section 8.03 than such Bank would have
been   entitled  to  receive  with  respect  to  the  rights
transferred,   unless  such  transfer  is  made   with   the
Borrower's  prior  written  consent  or  by  reason  of  the
provisions  of Section 8.02 or 8.03 requiring such  Bank  to
designate  a  different  Applicable  Lending  Office   under
certain  circumstances or at a time when  the  circumstances
giving rise to such greater payment did not exist.

represents to the Agent and each of the other Banks that  it
in  good  faith is not relying upon any "margin  stock"  (as

                                        June 12, 1996

          For value received, JOHN WILEY & SONS, INC., a New
York  corporation (the "Borrower"), promises to pay  to  the
order of ______________ (the "Bank"), for the account of its
Applicable  Lending Office, the unpaid principal  amount  of
each  Loan made by the Bank to the Borrower pursuant to  the
Credit  Agreement referred to below on the last day  of  the
Interest   Period  relating  to  such  Loan.   The  Borrower
promises  to pay interest on the unpaid principal amount  of
each  such  Loan  on  the dates and at  the  rate  or  rates
provided for in the Credit Agreement.  All such payments  of
principal and interest shall be made in lawful money of  the
United  States  in  Federal or other  immediately  available
funds at the office of Morgan Guaranty Trust Company of  New
York, 60 Wall Street, New York, New York.

           All  Loans made by the Bank, the respective types
and  maturities thereof and all repayments of the  principal
thereof  shall  be recorded by the Bank and,  prior  to  any
transfer  hereof,  appropriate  notations  to  evidence  the
foregoing  information with respect to each such  Loan  then
outstanding  shall be endorsed by the Bank on  the  schedule
attached  hereto,  or  on a continuation  of  such  schedule
attached  to  and  made  a part hereof;  provided  that  the
failure  of  the  Bank  to  make  any  such  recordation  or
endorsement shall not affect the obligations of the Borrower
hereunder or under the Credit Agreement.

           This note is one of the Notes referred to in  the
Credit  Agreement  dated  as of  June  12,  1996  among  the
Borrower,  the  banks listed on the signature pages  thereof

                         OPINION OF
                  COUNSEL FOR THE BORROWER


                                     June 12, 1996


To the Banks and the Agent
  Referred to Below
c/o Morgan Guaranty Trust Company
  of New York, as Agent
60 Wall Street
New York, New York  10260-0060

Dear Sirs:


           I  am counsel for John Wiley & Sons, Inc., a  New
York  corporation (the "Borrower") and have acted as counsel
to the Borrower in connection with the Credit Agreement (the
"Agreement")  dated as of June 12, 1996 among the  Borrower,
the  banks  from  time to time parties  thereto  and  Morgan
Guaranty Trust Company of New York, as Agent.  Terms defined
in the Agreement are used herein as therein defined.

           I have examined originals or copies, certified or
otherwise  identified to my satisfaction, of such documents,
corporate  records,  certificates of  public  officials  and
other    instruments   and   have   conducted   such   other
investigations  of fact and law as we have deemed  necessary
or advisable for purposes of this opinion.

           Upon  the basis of the foregoing, we are  of  the
opinion that:

            1.    The   Borrower   is  a  corporation   duly
incorporated,  validly existing and in good  standing  under
the  laws  of  the State of New York, and has all  corporate
powers    and    all    material   governmental    licenses,
authorizations, consents and approvals required to carry  on
its business as now conducted.
<PAGE>
          2.  The execution, delivery and performance by the
Borrower  of  the  Agreement and each Note  are  within  the
Borrower's corporate power, have been duly authorized by all
necessary  corporate action, require  no  action  by  or  in
respect of, or filing with, any governmental body, agency or
official  and  do  not contravene, or constitute  a  default
under, any provision of applicable law or regulation  or  of
the  Restated Certificate of Incorporation or by-laws of the
Borrower  or of any agreement, judgment, injunction,  order,
decree  or  other  instrument binding upon the  Borrower  or
result  in  the creation or imposition of any  Lien  on  any
asset of the Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries.

           3.  The Agreement constitutes a valid and binding
agreement of the Borrower and each Note constitutes a  valid
and  binding  obligation  of  the  Borrower,  in  each  case
enforceable in accordance with its terms, except as the same
may  be  limited by bankruptcy, insolvency or  similar  laws
affecting   creditors'  rights  generally  and  by   general
principles of equity.

          4.  There is no action, suit or proceeding pending
against,  or to the best of my knowledge threatened  against
or  affecting the Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries before
any court or arbitrator or any governmental body, agency  or
official, in which there is a reasonable possibility  of  an
adverse decision which could materially adversely affect the
business,  consolidated financial position  or  consolidated
results  of  operations of the Borrower and its Consolidated
Subsidiaries or which in any manner draws into question  the
validity of the Agreement or each Note.

           5.   I have no reason to believe that each of the
Borrower's   Subsidiaries  is   not   a   corporation   duly
incorporated,  validly existing and in good  standing  under
the  laws of its jurisdiction of incorporation, or that each
does   not  have  all  corporate  powers  and  all  material
governmental   licenses,   authorizations,   consents    and
approvals  required  to  carry  on  its  business   as   now
conducted.

Very truly yours,

<DESCRIPTION>1990 DIRECTOR STOCK PLAN
<TEXT>

                                                 Exhibit  10.8
                                                 -------------


                    JOHN WILEY & SONS, INC.
                   1990 DIRECTOR STOCK PLAN
          AS AMENDED AND RESTATED AS OF JUNE 22, 1995
        ----------------------------------------------

1.    Purposes.   The purposes of the 1990 Director Stock Plan
as  Amended and Restated as of June 22, 1995 (the "Plan")  are
to  (a)  attract  and retain highly qualified  individuals  to
serve  as directors of John Wiley & Sons, Inc. (the "Company")
and  (b)  to increase the Non-Employee Directors' (as  defined
below) stock ownership in the Company.

2.    Effective Date.   The Plan shall be amended and restated
effective as of June 22, 1995, subject to the approval of  the
shareholders of the Company.

3.    Participation.    Only Non-Employee Directors  shall  be
eligible   to   participate  in  the  Plan.   A  "Non-Employee
Director"  is  a  person who is serving as a director  of  the
Company  and  who  is not an employee of the  Company  or  any
subsidiary of the Company.

4.   Fifty Percent Grant.   The date of each Annual Meeting of
company  shareholders  (each an "Annual  Meeting")  is  herein
called  a  "Measurement  Date."  Commencing  with  the  annual
meeting  held in September 1991, as soon as practicable  after
every Annual Meeting, each Non-Employee Director shall receive
shares  of  the  company's  Class A  common  stock  ("Stock"),
rounded  upward or downward to the nearest whole share,  equal
in value to 50 percent of the cash compensation which such Non-
Employee Director has received (or would have received but for
an election pursuant to Section 5 hereof) from the Company for
services  as a Non-Employee Director in respect of the  period
beginning on the day immediately following the Annual  Meeting
in  the  preceding year and ending with the date of  the  just
concluded  Annual  Meeting (the latter  being  the  applicable
Measurement  Date).  The value of the Stock  for  purposes  of
this  paragraph  shall  be determined  as  of  the  applicable
Measurement Date and shall be equal to the closing  price  for
the  Stock as reported by any exchange on which the Stock  may
be  listed  on  such date or, if no shares of the  Stock  were
traded  on such date, on the next preceding date on which  the
Stock was so traded.

<PAGE>

5.    Election to Receive Stock in Lieu of Eligible Cash Fees.
Subject  to  the terms and conditions of the Plan,  each  Non-
Employee Director may elect to forego all or a portion of  the
cash  compensation  otherwise  payable  for  services  to   be
rendered  by  such Non-Employee Director during  the  Director
Year  (as defined below) which begins after the date on  which
such  election is made, in increments of 25%, 50%, 75% or 100%
of  such  compensation, and to receive in lieu  thereof  whole
shares  of  Stock (rounded upward or downward to  the  nearest
whole  share),  as  determined in accordance  with  Section  7
hereof.    A  "Director  Year"  is  the  twelve-month   period
beginning on April 1 of each calendar year and ending on March
31  of  the immediately following calendar year.  An  election
under  this Section 5 to have cash compensation paid in shares
of  Stock  shall be valid only if it is in writing, signed  by
the  Non-Employee  Director,  and  filed  with  the  Corporate
Secretary of the Company but, in any event, such election must
be  irrevocable with respect to the Director Year to which  it
applies and must be made no later than six months prior to the
beginning  of such Director Year.  Stock to be received  by  a
Non-Employee Director pursuant to his or her election shall be
distributed to such Non-Employee Director at the end  of  each
calendar quarter.

6.    Cash  Compensation.   For purposes of  this  Plan,  cash
compensation  shall  mean the Non-Employee  Director's  annual
retainer,   the  additional  retainer  received  by  committee
chairmen and the Non-Employee Director's fee for attendance at
meetings  of  the  Board  of Directors  of  the  Company  (the
"Board") or of Board committees, but shall not include a  Non-
Employee Director's expense reimbursements.

7.    Equivalent Amount of Stock.   The number of whole shares
of  Stock  to  be  distributed to a Non-Employee  Director  in
accordance  with  such Non-Employee Director's  election  made
under Section 5 above shall be equal to:

      (a)   the amount of the cash compensation which the Non-
Employee Director has elected to forego in exchange for shares
of Stock, divided by

      (b)  the closing price for the Stock as reported by  any
exchange on which the Stock may be listed on the date  of  the
regularly  scheduled  quarterly  meeting  of  the   Board   of
Directors or, if no shares of Stock were traded on such  date,
on the next preceding date on which the Stock was traded.

<PAGE>

8.    Shares Subject To The Plan.  All shares of Stock  to  be
used  for purposes of this Plan shall be treasury shares, that
is,  shares previously issued and outstanding which have  been
reacquired  by  the Company and have not been  canceled.   The
shares of Stock issued to a Non-Employee Director pursuant  to
the  provisions of this Plan may not be sold for at least  six
months after having been acquired, except in the case of death
or disability of the Non-Employee Director.

9.    Nonassignability.  No rights under  the  Plan  shall  be
assignable  or  transferable by a Non-Employee Director  other
than by will or the laws of descent and distribution.


10.  Construction; Amendment; Termination.  This Plan shall be
construed in accordance with the laws of the State of New York
and  may be amended or terminated at any time by action of the
Board,  provided, however, that the Plan may  not  be  amended
more  than  once every six months other than to  comport  with
changes in the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended,  the
Employee  Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, as  amended,
or the rules thereunder.

                     II.  PLAN OBJECTIVES
                               
The purpose of this plan is to enable the company to reinforce
and  sustain  a  culture  devoted  to  excellent  performance,
emphasize long term financial performance at the corporate and
division  levels,  reward  significant  contributions  to  the
success  of  the company, attract and retain highly  qualified
executives, and provide an opportunity for each participant to
acquire equity in the company.

                       III.  ELIGIBILITY
                               
The   participant  is  selected  by  the  ECDC  in  its   sole
discretion,  from  among  those employees  in  key  management
positions   deemed   able  to  make   the   most   significant
contributions to the growth and profitability of the  company.
An  employee  must be a participant of the FY  1997  Executive
Annual  Incentive Plan to be eligible to participate  in  this
plan.  The President and CEO of the company is a participant.
                               
                        IV.  INCENTIVE
                               
A.   The participant's target incentive is determined based on
     the   participant's  position  in  the  company  and  the
     contributions  the position is deemed  able  to  make  in
     achieving the cumulative financial goals of the company.

B.   The  participant's target incentive is recommended by the
     President  and  CEO to the ECDC for its and  the  Board's
     approval.   In  the case of the President  and  CEO,  the
     target  incentive  is recommended by  the  ECDC  for  the
     Board's approval.

C.   The   incentive's  two  components  may   be   restricted
     performance shares, if authorized by the ECDC, and cash.
<PAGE>

          V.  PERFORMANCE MEASUREMENT AND OBJECTIVES
                               
A.   The  objectives  for the cumulative financial  goals  are
     recommended  by the ECDC with the advice of  the  Finance
     Committee  to the Board for its approval.  The cumulative
     financial goals performance objectives are set at a level
     which are challenging and achievable.

B.   Cumulative   financial   goals   established   for   each
     participant   may  include  one  or  more  organizational
     level's financial goals (e.g. company and division),  and
     one   or   more   financial  goals   for   a   particular
     organizational  unit (e.g. cash flow, income,  divisional
     operating income).  The weighting of and between the  two
     organizational  levels' cumulative  financial  goals  may
     vary,   depending   upon   the  participant's   position.
     Weighting of the participant's cumulative financial goals
     is  recommended by the President and CEO to the ECDC.  In
     the  case  of  the  President  and  CEO,  the  cumulative
     financial goals are operating income, net income and cash
     flow.

C.   Threshold, target and outstanding performance levels  for
     the  cumulative  financial goals are recommended  by  the
     President  and  CEO  for approval by the  ECDC,  and  the
     Board.

                  VI.  PERFORMANCE EVALUATION
                               
A.   Cumulative Financial Results

     1.   Actual cumulative financial results achieved by  the
          company  and by each division will be calculated  at
          the end of the plan cycle, subject to adjustment for
          audited  results,  and  will be  compared  with  the
          previously set cumulative financial goals.
     
     2.   The cumulative financial results will be reviewed by
          the  President and CEO to determine proposed  payout
          factors for the company and for the divisions.
     
     3.   The  President and CEO will provide to  the  ECDC  a
          view  of the company's achievement of its cumulative
          financial  goals, as well as divisional  achievement
          of  like  objectives,  if any,  and  will  recommend
          payout  factors  to  be used  for  the  company  and
          divisional objectives.

<PAGE>

B.   Award Determination
     1.   At  least threshold performance, in aggregate, of  a
          participant's   particular  organizational   level's
          objectives  is  necessary  for  the  participant  to
          receive  a  payout for the particular organizational
          level.   However,  once  the  overall  threshold  is
          achieved  for any single measure the non-achievement
          of  any  one particular cumulative financial  goal's
          target objective does not preclude a payout.
     
     2.   The   determination   of   the   performance   level
          achievement  (threshold, target and outstanding,  or
          points  in between) for each organizational  level's
          cumulative  financial goals will be made independent
          of   any  other  organizational  level's  cumulative
          financial goals a participant may have.
     
     3.   If  the participant has more than one organizational
          level's   cumulative  financial  goals,   the   non-
          achievement of a threshold performance level of  one
          organizational  level's cumulative  financial  goals
          does   not   preclude  a  payout   for   the   other
          organizational level's cumulative financial goals.
     
     4.   The  following details the effect of the  cumulative
          financial   results   performance   levels   on    a
          participant's  payout  amount.   The  actual  payout
          factors  will be in the sole judgment and discretion
          of  the  ECDC,  taking  into account  the  following
          guidelines:

          a.   For  below  threshold performance in aggregate,
               the payout amount is zero.
          
          b.   For company threshold performance in aggregate,
               25% of the target incentive may be recommended.
               For   divisional   threshold   performance   in
               aggregate, 50% of the target incentive  may  be
               recommended
          
          c.   For   between  company  threshold  and   target
               performance in aggregate, at minimum 25% of the
               target  incentive and up to 100% of the  target
               incentive  may  be  recommended.   For  between
               divisional threshold and target performance  in
               aggregate,   at  minimum  50%  of  the   target
               incentive   and  up  to  100%  of  the   target
               incentive may be recommended.
          
          d.   For  target performance in aggregate,  100%  of
               the target incentive may be recommended.

<PAGE>
          
          e.   For  between target and outstanding performance
               in  aggregate,  at minimum 100% of  the  target
               incentive   and  up  to  150%  of  the   target
               incentive may be recommended.
          
          f.   For  outstanding performance in aggregate, 150%
               of the target incentive may be recommended.
          
     5.   Notwithstanding  anything  to  the   contrary,   the
          maximum  payout  amount, if any, a  participant  may
          receive is 150% of the target incentive.
     
                          VII PAYOUTS

A.   The  cash  payout amount will be based on  the  following
     formula:
**************************************************************
 Target Incentive  x  Corporate Weighting  x  Payout Factor  =
                  Corporate Incentive Payout
                               
   Target Incentive  x  Divisional Weighting  x  Divisional
         Payout Factor  =  Divisional Incentive Payout
                               
    Corporate Incentive Payout + (if applicable) Divisional
 Incentive Payout - (Plan End Adjusted Restricted performance
 shares Award x Stock Price at Beginning of Plan Cycle) = Cash
                         Payout Amount

Note:  See Section VIII for information regarding the
proportion of the payout amount which is paid in cash and in
restricted performance shares.
*************************************************************

B.   The  restricted  performance shares and  portion  of  the
     payout  amount,  if any, will be made  as  set  forth  in
     Section  VIII below.  The determination by  the  ECDC  of
     plan  end  adjusted restricted performance  shares  shall
     constitute payout of this portion of the award.

C.   The  cash  payout, if any, of the payout amount  will  be
     made within 90 days after the end of the plan cycle.

D.   In   the   event  of  a  participant's  death,  permanent
     disability, retirement or leave of absence prior  to  the
     end  of  the  plan  cycle, restricted performance  shares
     awarded  at the beginning of the plan cycle, if any,  are
     forfeited,  and  the  payout  amount,  if  any,  will  be
     determined by the ECDC in its sole discretion.

E.   A   participant  who  resigns,  or  whose  employment  is
     terminated  by the company, with or without cause,  prior
     to  the  end  of  the plan cycle, is not eligible  for  a
     payout   amount   and   shall  forfeit   any   restricted
     performance shares awarded at the beginning of  the  plan
     cycle.
<PAGE>
     VIII.  RESTRICTED PERFORMANCE SHARES AWARD PROVISIONS
                               
A.   Since  one  of the objectives of this plan is to  provide
     the  participant with an equity stake in the company  and
     align   management  and  shareholder  interests,  it   is
     intended that a portion of the target incentive, will  be
     awarded in equity (restricted performance shares) and the
     remaining  portion  will  be awarded  in  cash.   At  the
     beginning of the plan cycle, the ECDC will determine  the
     proportion of the target incentive that will be allocated
     between  restricted performance shares, and cash.   While
     it  is intended that such proportions will be maintained,
     the actual proportions may be adjusted by the ECDC at the
     end of the plan cycle, in its sole discretion.

B.   Restricted  performance shares, if any, shall be  awarded
     at  the beginning of the plan cycle, after the June, 1996
     ECDC  meeting.   The  amount  of  restricted  performance
     shares  awarded shall be based on the proportion  of  the
     target  incentive  allocated  to  restricted  performance
     shares,  as  determined by the ECDC.  The value  of  each
     share will be determined based on the stock closing  sale
     price, as reported by the NYSE, on the date the ECDC acts
     at  the beginning of the plan cycle (June 13, 1996).   In
     the event the stock is not traded on June 13, 1996 or the
     date the ECDC acts, whichever is later, the closing sales
     price  shall  be the price of the stock on the  next  day
     after  June 13, 1996 or the date the ECDC acts  on  which
     the  stock  trades, whichever is later.   The  restricted
     performance shares awarded at the beginning of  the  plan
     cycle  also  is subject to adjustment at the end  of  the
     plan  cycle  as set forth in Sections VIII  (C)  and  (D)
     below.   Restricted performance shares, if any, shall  be
     awarded pursuant to the shareholder plan, as approved  by
     the  ECDC.  In  addition to the terms and conditions  set
     forth in the shareholder plan and Section VII (D) and (E)
     below, the following conditions shall apply:

     1.   During  the  plan cycle, the participant  shall  not
          have   the  right  to  receive  dividends  or  other
          distributions with respect to restricted performance
          shares  received at the beginning of the plan  cycle
          and  shall  not have the right to vote such  shares.
          After  the  end  of the plan cycle,  and  after  all
          adjustments  to the amount of restricted performance
          shares  are made by the ECDC as set forth in Section
          VII(D) and (E) below, the participant shall have the
          right  to  receive dividends or other  distributions
          with  respect  to  the  final amount  of  restricted
          performance shares issued and shall have  the  right
          to vote such shares.  The date on which the dividend
          and  voting  rights shall commence is  the  date  on
          which  the ECDC makes its determination of the final
          number  of  restricted  performance  shares  awarded
          after the plan cycle ends pursuant to Section VII(D)
          and (E) below.
     <PAGE>
     2.   During   the   restricted  period,  the   restricted
          performance  shares may not be sold or  transferred.
          Restricted performance shares shall be legended  and
          held by the Company.
     
     3.   Withholding taxes relating to restricted performance
          shares  awarded  may  be satisfied  by  surrendering
          shares  to the company, in lieu of cash, upon  lapse
          of the restrictions.
     
     4.   The  restricted  period  for restricted  performance
          shares  awarded  shall be as  follows:   subject  to
          continued  employment except as otherwise set  forth
          in  the shareholder plan or Sections VII and VIII of
          this plan, the lapse of restrictions on one-half  of
          the restricted performance shares awarded will occur
          on  the  first anniversary (April 30, 2000)  of  the
          plan  end  date  at which time the participant  will
          receive  a  new  stock certificate in  a  number  of
          shares   equal   to  one-half  of   the   restricted
          performance  shares  awarded  with  the  restrictive
          legend deleted, and the lapse of restrictions on the
          remaining  half will occur on the second anniversary
          (April 30, 2001) of the plan end date at which  time
          the participant will receive a new stock certificate
          in  a  number of shares equal to the remaining  half
          with the restrictive legend deleted.
     
     5.   If  the  participant  dies  or  becomes  permanently
          disabled   during   the   restricted   period,   the
          restrictions  on  the restricted performance  shares
          will lapse on the date of such event.
     
     6.   If  the  participant retires during  the  restricted
          period  at or after his/her normal retirement  date,
          the   restrictions  on  the  restricted  performance
          shares will lapse on the date of such event.
     
     7.   If the participant takes early retirement during the
          restricted   period,   the   restrictions   on   the
          restricted  performance shares will not lapse  until
          the  restricted period expires.  If the  participant
          dies  between the time the participant  takes  early
          retirement  and  the  end of the  restricted  period
          (April  30, 2001), the lapse of restrictions on  the
          restricted performance shares will occur on the date
          of such event.
     
     8.   The restricted performance shares may be adjusted by
          the  ECDC for any change in the capital stock of the
          company,   as  provided  in  Section   II   of   the
          shareholder plan and is in all respects  subject  to
          the provisions of that plan.
     
     <PAGE>
     
     9.   In  the event of a change of control, whether before
          or  after  the end of the plan cycle, as defined  in
          the  shareholder  plan,  all  shares  of  restricted
          performance  shares  which  would  otherwise  remain
          subject to restrictions under the plan shall be free
          of such restrictions.

C.   The  number  of  shares of restricted performance  shares
     awarded  at  the  beginning of the  plan  cycle,  may  be
     adjusted  at the end of the plan cycle  for the following
     reasons:   (1) if the proportion of the target  incentive
     award  of  restricted performance shares is  adjusted  at
     the  end  of the plan cycle by the ECDC as set  forth  in
     Section  VIII  (A) and/or (2) when the payout  factor  is
     adjusted  at  the end of the plan cycle based  on  actual
     achievement of target objectives.

D.   The  final  amount of restricted performance shares  will
     be  determined  as  follows:  The restricted  performance
     shares  established by the ECDC at the beginning  of  the
     plan  cycle  times (x) the payout factor equals  (=)  the
     plan  end  adjusted restricted performance shares  award.
     The  result of this calculation will be compared  to  the
     restricted  performance shares awarded at  the  beginning
     of   the  plan  cycle,  and  the  appropriate  amount  of
     restricted   performance  shares  will  be   awarded   or
     forfeited,   as   required,  to  bring   the   restricted
     performance  shares  award  to  the  number   of   shares
     designated as the plan end adjusted stock award.

                       IX.  STOCK OPTION
                               
The  participant may be granted a stock option pursuant to the
shareholder   plan  at  the  beginning  of  the  plan   cycle,
representing   another   incentive  vehicle   by   which   the
participant  is  able  to share in the equity  growth  of  the
company.  The number of shares in the stock option granted  to
a  participant under this plan is based on a set of  variables
and  assumptions,  applied consistently to  all  participants,
regarding the monetary value a participant might receive  upon
exercise of the stock option.  The terms and conditions of the
award  of  the  stock option are contained in the  shareholder
plan  and  in  the  stock  option  award.   Withholding  taxes
relating to the gain realized on the exercise of an option may
be  satisfied  by surrendering to the company  the  equivalent
value of the taxes, or a portion thereof, in option shares  in
lieu of cash.

                       III.  ELIGIBILITY
                               
The  participant is selected by the President and CEO  of  the
company,   from  among  those  employees  in  key   management
positions   deemed   able  to  make   the   most   significant
contributions to the growth and profitability of the  company,
with  the approval of the ECDC.  The President and CEO of  the
company is a participant.

          IV.  PERFORMANCE OBJECTIVES AND MEASUREMENT
                               
The  plan employs two categories of objectives for performance
measurement:   financial goals and strategic milestones.   The
weighting  of and between the two measures may vary, depending
upon the participant's position.  Weighting is recommended  by
the  participant's manager and approved by the  President  and
CEO,  if  the  President  and CEO  is  not  the  participant's
manager.

A.   Financial Goals
     1.   Financial goals for the company are determined  near
          the  beginning of the plan year by the President and
          CEO.  The President and CEO's goals are reviewed and
          approved  by the Finance Committee of the Board  and
          ECDC, and approved by the Board.
     
     2.   Financial goals are set for the company as  a  whole
          and  for  each  division and may be revised  in  the
          interim,  as appropriate.  The participant  will  be
          given   specific  financial  goals,  based   on   an
          appropriate   mix   of   company   and/or   division
          objectives.
     
     3.   Financial   goals   include   defining   levels   of
          performance (threshold, target and outstanding)  and
          the measures of each.
     
B.   Strategic Milestones
     1.   Strategic  milestones  are non-financial  individual
          objectives  over which the participant has  a  large
          measure  of control, which lead to, or are  expected
          to  lead to improved performance for the company  in
          the  future.   Strategic milestones  are  determined
          near   the  beginning  of  the  plan  year  by   the
          participant,   and  approved  by  the  participant's
          manager,  if  the  President  and  CEO  is  not  the
          participant's manager.
     
     2.   The  strategic milestones for the President and  CEO
          are  reviewed  and  approved by  the  Executive  and
          Policy Committee of the Board and by the Board.
     
     3.   The  strategic milestones for the President and  CEO
          should  be appropriately reflected in those  of  all
          other  employees  at all levels.   Each  participant
          collaborates   with  his/her  manager   in   setting
          strategic milestones.  The strategic milestones  may
          be revised in the interim, as appropriate.
     
     4.   The  determination of strategic milestones  includes
          defining  a  target  level of  performance  and  the
          measure  of such, and may include defining threshold
          and   outstanding  levels  of  performance  and  the
          measures of such.

                  V.  PERFORMANCE EVALUATION
                               
A.   Financial Results
     1.  Actual financial results achieved by the company  and
          by each group and division will be calculated at the
          end  of  the  plan year, subject to  adjustment  for
          audited   results,   and  will  be   compared   with
          previously set financial goals.
     
     2.  Actual  financial  results will be  reviewed  by  the
          participant's manager and the President and CEO  and
          a  payout  factor determined.  The payout factor  is
          based  on  a judgment of the relative importance  of
          financial  results and the achievement  compared  to
          the  financial goals.  This payout factor is subject
          to the review and approval of the President and CEO.
          The  ECDC  will  evaluate the  President  and  CEO's
          financial  results and will recommend to  the  Board
          his/her financial results payout factor.

B.  Strategic Milestones
     1.   Achievement of a participant's strategic  milestones
          will  be  determined at the end of the plan year  by
          comparing   results  achieved  to   previously   set
          objectives.
     
     2.   Each  participant's manager will recommend a  payout
          factor  for  achievement of all strategic milestones
          compared  with  the previously set  objectives.   In
          determining   the   payout   factor,   the   overall
          performance  on  all  strategic milestones  will  be
          considered.   This payout factor is subject  to  the
          review  and approval of the President and  CEO,  the
          ECDC and the Board.  The ECDC will recommend to  the
          Board  for  approval  the  payout  factor  for   the
          President and CEO's achievement of his/her strategic
          milestones   based  on  the  Executive  and   Policy
          Committee  of  the  Board's  evaluation  of  his/her
          achievement   compared  with  the   previously   set
          objectives.
     
<PAGE>
     
C.  Award Determination
     1.   Financial  goals, established for each  participant,
          may  include  one  or  more  organizational  level's
          financial goals (e.g. company and division), and one
          or    more   financial   goal   for   a   particular
          organizational    unit.     At    least    threshold
          performance,   in  aggregate,  of  a   participant's
          particular organizational level is necessary for the
          participant  to receive a payout for the  particular
          organizational  level.  However,  once  the  overall
          threshold  is achieved, the non-achievement  of  any
          one  particular  financial goal's  target  objective
          does not preclude a payout for all the participant's
          financial goals.
     
     2.   At least threshold performance of financial goals is
          required  of the participant's organizational  level
          for a payout of strategic milestones to be made.  If
          the  participant is measured against more  than  one
          organizational level, at least threshold performance
          of    financial   goals,   is   required   of    the
          organizational level which has the greatest  percent
          weighting  of  the  organizational  levels'   target
          incentive   amount   for  a  payout   of   strategic
          milestones to be made.  If the percent weighting  of
          the  target  incentive amount is equal for  all  the
          organizational levels against which the  participant
          is  measured, then at least threshold performance of
          financial goals is required of all the participant's
          organizational  levels  for a  payout  of  strategic
          milestones to be made.
     
     3.   Payout eligibility will be determined by calculating
          the  amount for achievement of financial  goals  and
          strategic milestones and adding the two together, as
          follows:

**************************************************************

4.   Notwithstanding  anything to the  contrary,  the  maximum
     payout, if any, a participant may receive is 150% of  the
     target incentive amount.

5.  The  foregoing  EAIP  payout  eligibility  calculation  is
     intended  to set forth general guidelines on  how  awards
     are  to  be determined.  The purpose of this plan  is  to
     motivate  the  participant to perform in  an  outstanding
     manner.  The President and CEO has discretion under  this
     plan  to take into consideration the contribution of  the
     participant,  the  participant's  management  of  his/her
     organizational unit and other relevant factors,  positive
     or    negative,   which   impact   the   company's,   the
     participant's    organizational    unit(s),    and    the
     participant's performance overall in determining  whether
     to recommend granting or denying an award, and the amount
     of  the  award,  if  any.   If  the  participant  is  the
     President and CEO, such discretion is to be exercised  by
     the ECDC and the Board.
                               
                         VI.  PAYOUTS
                               
Payouts will be made within 90 days after the end of the  plan
year and will be based on audited financial results.

                     VII.  STATUS CHANGES
                               
A.  In   the  event  of  a  participant's  death,  disability,
     retirement or leave of absence prior to payout  from  the
     plan,  the  payout,  if any, will be  determined  by  the
     President and CEO in his/her sole discretion, subject  to
     any  approval of the ECDC in its sole discretion, subject
     to  any required Board approvals.  If  the participant is
     the  President and CEO, such approval is required by  the
     Board, in its sole discretion.

B.  A   participant  who  resigns,  or  whose  employment   is
     terminated by the company, with or without cause,  before
     payout  from the plan is distributed, will not receive  a
     payout.   Exception to this provision shall be made  only
     with  the  approval of the ECDC, in its sole  discretion,
     subject  to  any  required  Board  approvals.    If   the
     participant  is the President and CEO, such  approval  is
     required by the Board in its sole discretion.

C.  A  participant  who  transfers between  divisions  of  the
     company, will have his/her payout prorated to the nearest
     fiscal quarter for the time spent in each division, based
     on  the  achievement  of financial  goals  and  strategic
     milestones established for the position in each division,
     and   based   upon   a  judgment  of  the   participant's
     contribution  to  the  achievement  of  goals   in   each
     position, including interim revisions, if appropriate.

D.  A  participant  who  is appointed to  a  position  with  a
     different  target  incentive percent  will  have  his/her
     payout  prorated  to the nearest fiscal quarter  for  the
     time spent in each position, based on the achievement  of
     financial goals and strategic milestones established  for
     each position.

E.  A  participant who is hired or promoted into  an  eligible
     position  during  the plan year may  receive  a  prorated
     payout as determined by the President and CEO, in his/her
     sole discretion, subject to the approval of the ECDC.

            VIII.  ADMINISTRATION AND OTHER MATTERS
                               
A.  The  plan  is  effective  for  the  plan  year.   It  will
     terminate, subject to payout, if any, in accordance  with
     and subject to the provisions of this plan unless renewed
     by the company in writing in its sole discretion.

B.  This  plan will be administered by the President and  CEO,
     who  will have authority to interpret and administer this
     plan,   including,  without  limitation,  all   questions
     regarding  eligibility  and status  of  the  participant,
     subject  to the approval of the ECDC required under  this
     plan or the by-laws of the company.
<PAGE>

     time,  and  for any reason, in writing, in the  company's
     sole discretion.

D.  The  determination of an award and payout under this plan,
     if  any, is subject to the approval of the President  and
     CEO,  the  ECDC, and the Board in their sole  discretion.
     This  plan does not confer upon any participant the right
     to receive any payout, or payment of any kind whatsoever.
E.  No  participant  shall have any vested rights  under  this
     plan.  This plan does not constitute a contract.

F.  All  deductions  and other withholdings  required  by  law
