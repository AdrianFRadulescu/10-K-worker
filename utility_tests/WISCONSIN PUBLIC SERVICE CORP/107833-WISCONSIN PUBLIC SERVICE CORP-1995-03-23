  ITEM 1.  BUSINESS
  
                                A.  GENERAL
  
       Wisconsin Public Service Corporation ("Company"), a Wisconsin
  corporation, which was incorporated July 17, 1883, is a regulated
  public utility engaged chiefly in the production, transmission,
  distribution and sale of electricity and in the purchase,
  transportation, distribution and sale of natural gas.  On September 1,
  1994, the Company became a wholly-owned subsidiary of WPS Resources
  Corporation ("WPSR") as a result of a one-for-one exchange of common
  stock shares.  Also on September 1, 1994, all of the capital stock of
  WPS Communications, Inc. and Packerland Energy Services, Inc. was
  transferred to WPSR as part of a corporate restructuring.
  
        At year end 1994, the Company served at retail 353,893 electric
  customers and 196,666 gas customers in an 11,000 square mile service
  territory in Northeastern Wisconsin and an adjacent part of Upper
  Michigan.  Additionally, the Company provides wholesale full or
  partial requirements electric service, either directly or indirectly,
  to eleven municipal utilities, and also two Rural Electrification
  Administration financed electric cooperatives and a privately held
  utility.  About 98% of operating revenues in the year 1994 were
  derived from Wisconsin customers and 2% from Michigan customers.  Of
  total revenues in 1994, 73% were from electric operations and 27% from
  gas operations.  Of total electric revenues, 91% were from retail
  sales and 9% were from wholesale sales.
  
       The Company's retail service areas are principally protected in
  Wisconsin by indeterminate permits secured by statute, and in the
  state of Michigan by franchises granted by municipalities.
  
  
                          B.  ELECTRIC OPERATIONS
  
       GENERAL MATTERS.  The largest communities served at retail with
  electricity are the cities of Green Bay, Oshkosh, Wausau and Stevens
  Point.
  
       The Company's maximum net demand in 1994 was 1,549,000 kw which
  occurred on June 16.  At that time, system capability was
  1,819,900 kw, and after adjustments for firm purchases and sales to
  other utilities, the Company's reserve capacity was 16.6%.  This 1994
  maximum net demand was slightly lower than the 1993 summer net peak
  demand.  The Company's future reserves, also adjusted for firm
  purchases and sales and planned capacity additions, are estimated to
  be above the planning criteria of a 15% minimum reserve in 1995 and
  1996.  See Part I, Item 2, PROPERTIES, at page 23 for information
  concerning generating facilities.
<PAGE>
       Coordinated planning for generation and transmission is a
  function of the Wisconsin Upper Michigan Systems of which the Company
  is a member along with Wisconsin Power and Light Company ("WP&L"),
  Madison Gas & Electric Company ("MG&E"), Wisconsin Electric Power
  Company ("WEPCO"), Upper Peninsula Power Company and Wisconsin Public
  Power, Inc. ("WPPI").  Existing and planned interconnections with
  other neighboring utilities provide a further means of sharing reserve
  capacities and interchanging energy. 
        
       The Company owns 33.1% of the outstanding capital stock of
  Wisconsin River Power Company ("River Power").  The business of River
  Power consists of the ownership and operation of two dams and related
  hydroelectric plants on the Wisconsin River having an aggregate
  installed capacity of about 35,000 kw.  The output of the
  hydroelectric plants is sold, at the sites of the plants, to the three
  companies which own the outstanding capital stock substantially in
  proportion to their stock ownership interests.
  
       KEWAUNEE NUCLEAR POWER PLANT.  The Company is the operator and
  41.2% owner of Kewaunee which is owned jointly with WP&L and MG&E. 
  This plant began commercial operation in 1974.  The Kewaunee
  capability factor was 86.6% in 1994, compared to a projected industry
  average of 73.7%.
  
       The Company is a member of the Institute of Nuclear Power
  Operations ("INPO"), an organization of nuclear utilities which
  promotes excellence in all aspects of nuclear plant operations.  INPO
  manages the accreditation process for industry training programs,
  which includes periodic accreditation of those training programs by an
  independent organization, the National Nuclear Accrediting Board
  ("NNAB").  All ten accredited training programs at Kewaunee are
  currently in good standing with the NNAB.     
   
       The steam generator tubes at Kewaunee are susceptible to
  corrosion characteristics seen throughout the nuclear industry. 
  Inspections are performed to identify degraded tubes.  Degraded tubes
  are either repaired by sleeving or are removed from service by
  plugging.  The steam generators were designed with approximately 15%
  heat transfer margin, meaning that full power should be sustainable
  with the equivalent of 15% of the steam generator tubes plugged.  Tube
  plugging and the build-up of deposits on the tubes affect the heat-
  transfer capability of the steam generators to the point where
  eventually full power operation is affected.  The result will be a
  gradual decrease in the capacity of the plant.  The plant's capacity
  could be reduced by as much as 20% by the year 2013 when the current
  operating license expires.  Currently, the equivalent of approximately
  12% of the tubes in the steam generators are plugged with no loss of
  capacity.  The Company recently completed studies evaluating the
  economics of replacing the two steam generators at Kewaunee.  The
  studies resulted in the conclusion that the most prudent course of
  action is to continue operation of the existing steam generators.  The
  Company continues to evaluate appropriate repair strategies, including
  replacement, as well as continued operation of the steam generators

                                    -2-
<PAGE>
  without replacement.  The Company also continues to fund the
  development of welded repair technology for steam generator tubes. 
   
       The Company continues to evaluate and implement initiatives to
  improve the performance of Kewaunee which already performs at above
  average levels for the industry.  These initiatives include conversion
  from a twelve-month to an eighteen-month operating cycle beginning in
  the spring of 1995 and numerous other cost reduction measures.  These
  initiatives have resulted in approximately a 25% reduction in Kewaunee
  operating and maintenance costs since 1991.
  
       Physical decommissioning of Kewaunee is expected to occur during
  the period 2014 to 2021 with additional expenditures being incurred
  during the period 2022 to 2050 related to the storage of spent nuclear
  fuel at the site.  In July of 1994, the Public Service Commission of
  Wisconsin ("PSCW") issued an order covering all Wisconsin utilities
  that have nuclear generation.  The order standardizes cost escalation
  assumptions used in determining decommissioning liabilities.  Based
  upon this new methodology, and considering other assumption changes,
  Kewaunee decommissioning costs are estimated to be $357 million in
  current dollars and $785 million in year of expenditure dollars. The
  Company's share of Kewaunee decommissioning costs are estimated to be
  $147 million in current dollars.  These costs are recovered currently
  in customer rates and deposited in external trusts.  As a result of
  the new order, annual funding is expected to increase from
  approximately $4.0 million to approximately $8.7 million.  On
  December 31, 1994, the market value of the investments in the trusts
  was $64.1 million.
  
       Spent fuel is currently stored at Kewaunee.  The existing
  capacity of the spent fuel storage facility will enable storage of the
  projected quantities of spent fuel through April 2001.   The Company
  is evaluating options for the storage of additional quantities beyond
  2001.  Several technologies are available.  An investment of
  approximately $2.5 million in the early 2000s could provide additional
  storage sufficient to meet spent fuel storage needs until the
  expiration of the current operating license in 2013.
  
       The Low-Level Radioactive Waste Policy Act of 1980 specifies that
  states may enter into compacts to provide for regional low level waste
  disposal facilities.  Wisconsin is a member of the Midwest Low Level
  Radioactive Waste Compact. The state of Ohio has been selected as the
  host state for the Midwest Compact and is proceeding with the
  preliminary phases of site selection.  In June of 1994, the Barnwell,
  South Carolina disposal facility, which had been accepting Kewaunee
  low level radioactive waste materials, discontinued taking waste
  materials from outside its region.  The Company expects to have
  sufficient storage space of its own to satisfy low level radioactive
  waste disposal needs until the Ohio facility accepts low level
  radioactive waste materials.

       FUEL SUPPLY.  The Company's electric generation mix in 1994
  compared to 1993 was:  steam plants (coal), 62.6%, down from 64.7%;
  steam plant (nuclear), 14.5%, down from 14.6%; hydro, 2.6%, down from
  3.2%; combined natural gas and fuel oil, .7%, up from .4%; and
  purchased power, 19.6%, up from 17.1%.  Purchased power represents
  short-term energy purchases.
  
       The Company has reduced over-all fuel costs for the fifth
  consecutive year.  Fuel costs in 1994 compared with 1993, expressed in
  dollars per million BTU, were:  nuclear, $.49, up from $.45; coal,
  $1.31, down from $1.38; natural gas, $2.77, down from $3.41; and No. 2
  fuel oil, $4.15, up from $3.96.   
  
       In 1995, the Company will purchase almost all of the coal for its
  solely-owned plants from Western sources.  Delivery of coal at the
  Pulliam plant is via railroad or lake vessel and at the Weston,
  Columbia and Edgewater plants via railroad.
  
       Pulliam and Weston Units 1 and 2 burn Powder River Basin sub-
  bituminous coal.  The Company has a long-term contract with one coal
  supplier that is expected to provide approximately two-thirds of the
  projected 1995 coal requirements for Unit 3 at Weston.  The coal
  contract will provide low sulfur Powder River Basin coal for a term
  ending in 2016.  The remainder of the coal for solely-owned generating
  facilities is purchased under short-term agreements of two years or
  less.
  
       During 1991, the Company bought-out the coal supply agreement
  with NERCO Coal Company ("NERCO") and the corresponding rail
  transportation contracts with the Soo Line and the Wisconsin Central
  ("Railroads").  The Company paid approximately $34 million to NERCO
  and the Railroads as compensation for relief of all contractual
  obligations.  The PSCW has ruled that the railroad and coal contract
  buyout costs may be recovered in customer rates subject to a benefits
  test.  Management believes it will meet the benefits test and,
  therefore, recover in future rates all of the buyout costs because the
  cost of replacement coal plus the buyout costs as amortized and a
  return on the unamortized portion of the buyout costs are less than
  the costs under the original contracts.  In the Wisconsin
  jurisdiction, the remaining unamortized buyout costs of $15.4 million
  will be recovered during 1995 and 1996.  The Federal Energy Regulatory
  Commission ("FERC") issued an order on November 15, 1994 allowing
  recovery of all but approximately $3.6 million of NERCO buyout costs
  through a monthly surcharge rate over the period January 1993 through
  December 2005.  The portion of the $3.6 million disallowance allocable
  to the FERC jurisdiction will not be determined until the end of 1995. 
  Management believes that it is likely that the disallowance allocable
  to the FERC jurisdiction will not exceed the $625,000 write off taken
  in 1993 in anticipation of the disallowance.  The Company will accrue
  and recover carrying charges on the unrecovered balance.  
  
       The Company also has a 31.8% ownership share in Columbia and a
  31.8% ownership share in the Edgewater Unit 4, both of which are

                                    -4-
<PAGE>
  operated by WP&L which has coal procurement responsibilities for these
  units.  Columbia, with two 527 megawatt units, uses coal from the
  Wyoming-Montana coal fields.  One hundred percent of the low sulfur
  coal for Unit 1 is supplied under terms of a contract which expires in
  2004.  The entire low sulfur coal supply for Unit 2 is supplied from
  the Southern Powder River Basin under short-term contracts.  Edgewater
  uses a blend of bituminous and sub-bituminous Powder River Basin coal
  both of which are acquired under short-term contracts.  
  
       In 1989, the PSCW concluded that WP&L did not properly administer
  a coal contract for Columbia, which is owned 31.8% by the Company,
  46.2% by WP&L and 22.0% by MG&E, and ordered WP&L to refund $9 million
  to the customers of the Company, WP&L and MG&E proportionately
  according to the ownership shares of each utility in Columbia.  WP&L
  appealed the PSCW decision, and that PSCW action was found to
  represent unlawful retroactive ratemaking by both the Dane County
  Circuit Court and the Wisconsin Court of Appeals.  On February 8,
  1994, the Wisconsin Supreme Court upheld the decision of the Wisconsin
  Court of Appeals.  
  
       The supply of nuclear fuel for Kewaunee requires the purchase of 
  uranium concentrates, the conversion of uranium concentrates to
  uranium hexafluoride, enrichment of the uranium hexafluoride and
  fabrication of the enriched uranium into usable fuel assemblies. 
  After a region (approximately one-third of the nuclear fuel assemblies
  in the reactor) of spent fuel is removed from the reactor, it is
  placed in temporary storage for cooling in a spent fuel pool at the
  plant site.  Permanent storage is addressed below.  There are
  presently no operating facilities in the United States reprocessing
  commercial nuclear fuel.  A discussion of the nuclear fuel supply for
  Kewaunee follows:
  
  (a)   Requirements for uranium are met through spot or contract
        purchases.  An inventory policy, which takes advantage of
        economical spot market purchases of uranium, results in the
        Company maintaining inventories sufficient for three reactor
        reloads of fuel.  
  
  (b)   Uranium hexafluoride from inventory and from spot market
        purchases was used to satisfy converted material requirements in
        1994.  The Company intends to purchase future conversion services
        on the spot market.
  
  (c)   In 1994, enriched uranium was procured from COGEMA, Inc. pursuant
        to a contract executed in 1983 and last amended in 1993. 
        Enrichment services were purchased from the United States
        Enrichment Corporation ("Enrichment Corporation") under the terms
        of the utility services contract which is in effect for the life
        of Kewaunee.  The Company is committed to take 70% of its annual
        enrichment requirements in 1995, and in alternate years
        thereafter, from the Enrichment Corporation.

                                    -5-
<PAGE>
  (d)   Fuel fabrication requirements through June 15, 1995 are covered
        by contract.  The Company is finalizing a contract for fuel
        fabrication extending through 2001.
  
  (e)   Beyond the stated periods set forth above, additional contracts
        for uranium concentrates, conversion to uranium hexafluoride,
        fabrication and spent fuel storage will have to be procured.  The
        Company anticipates the prices for the foregoing will increase.
  
       Pursuant to the Nuclear Waste Policy Act of 1982 ("Nuclear Policy
  Act"), the U. S. Department of Energy ("DOE") has entered into a
  contract with the Company to accept, transport and dispose of spent
  nuclear fuel beginning no later than January 31, 1998.  It is likely
  that the DOE will delay the acceptance of spent nuclear fuel beyond
  1998.  A fee to offset the costs of the DOE's disposal for all spent
  fuel used since April 7, 1983 has been assessed by DOE at one mill per
  net kilowatt hour of electricity generated and sold by Kewaunee.  An
  additional one-time fee was paid to the DOE for the disposal of spent
  nuclear fuel used to generate electricity prior to April 7, 1983.
  
       The Nuclear Policy Act provides that both the federal government
  and the nuclear utilities fund the decontamination and decommissioning
  of the three gaseous diffusion plants in the United States.  Utility
  contributions will be collected through a special assessment based on
  a utility's percentage of uranium enrichment services purchased
  through the date of enactment compared to total enrichment sales by
  the DOE.  The owners of Kewaunee are required to pay approximately
  $19.2 million in current dollars over a period of fifteen years.  At
  December 31, 1994, the remaining liability was $15.4 million of which
  the Company's share is $6.33 million.  The payments are subject to
  adjustment for inflation.
  
       RHINELANDER ENERGY CENTER. The Company has identified the need
  for additional power supply late in this decade.  To satisfy this
  need, the Company has signed a thirty-five year steam and electrical
  sales agreement with Rhinelander Paper Company, Inc. ("Rhinelander
  Paper") which likely will be amended to reflect continuing
  negotiations between the parties.  This agreement provides for the
  Company to construct, own and operate the Rhinelander Energy Center
  ("REC"), a 122 megawatt cogeneration facility, with an estimated cost
  of $169 million, adjacent to Rhinelander Paper's mill in Rhinelander,
  Wisconsin.  Rhinelander Paper will purchase and use steam from the
  facility in its paper processes. On September 24, 1993, the Company
  initiated the filing process for a Certificate of Public Convenience
  and Necessity ("CPCN") which must be issued by the PSCW to permit
  construction of the REC.  Action by the PSCW on the application is
  being carried out under a recently developed two-stage CPCN process
  regulated by the PSCW.  In the first stage, the Company requested
  proposals from electric generating plant project developers and
  compared them to the proposed REC.  On December 21, 1994, the PSCW
  issued its order approving the Company's REC project as the least cost
  solution to the Company's capacity needs.  One unsuccessful bidder,
  Polsky Energy Corporation ("Polsky") petitioned for a rehearing of the
  PSCW's decision.  The PSCW has agreed to consider Polsky's allegations

                                    -6-
<PAGE>
  regarding the accuracy of certain computations related to the
  Company's successful bid.  On March 9, 1995, in response to the Polsky
  petition, the PSCW affirmed their original decision in holding that
  the REC remains the least cost alternative which will satisfy the
  Company's additional capacity needs. The Company is proceeding with
  stage two of the CPCN process to obtain PSCW authorization to
  construct the REC, a process which is expected to result in a final
  decision on the CPCN in the second half of 1995 in order to have the
  facility in service in the summer of 1998.    
  
       OTHER MATTERS.  On January 14, 1994, the Company submitted its
  Advance Plan 7 filing to the PSCW.  It was updated on April 29, 1994. 
  This plan identifies both the demand side and supply side needs of the
  Company through the year 2013.  Preliminary plans indicate that demand
  side management programs will reduce the need for additional electric
  capacity by 269 megawatts.  Supply side generation forecasts indicate
  the need for peaking generating units in 2001, 2002, 2004 and 2005
  (combustion turbines of 75 megawatts each), an intermediate generating
  unit in 2009 (215 megawatt combined-cycle gas-fired unit), and a
  peaking generating unit in 2013 (75 megawatt combustion turbine).  The
  plan also includes 122 megawatts of cogeneration from the REC as
  discussed above.  Other smaller scale renewable projects are included
  in the plan.  Pulliam Units 3 and 4 are included in the plan as being
  retired in 1998.  They began operating in the 1940s.  Advance Plan 7
  must go through the regulatory review process. Hearings started in
  November of 1994 and are scheduled to conclude in May of 1995.
   
       The Company is developing and implementing strategies to deal
  with issues raised by the National Energy Policy Act of 1992 ("Policy
  Act").  The Policy Act's provisions for transmission access should
  have minimal impact on the Company because the Company already has
  transportation tariffs on file at the FERC.  The generation provisions
  of the Policy Act could create additional competition in that market;
  however, generation opportunities for the Company also could increase.
  
       Regionally, the member companies of the Mid-America
  Interconnected Network, of which the Company is a member, are planning
  the formation of a regional transmission group ("RTG") that will open
  up the entire transmission grid within the network to member companies
  and others who choose to participate.  It will then be easier than
  ever to transport electric power from one purchaser to another.  FERC
  must approve the agreement for the formation of a RTG.
  
       The Company faces increased competition in the wholesale power
  market.  This may result in the loss of certain wholesale customers
  and reduced margins.  The Company intends to compete aggressively to
  retain wholesale load.
  
       In October of 1992, WPPI notified the Company that it was ending
  its agreement to purchase power effective in October of 1997.  WPPI is
  a wholesale customer which buys 66 megawatts from the Company for
  resale to municipal utilities in Algoma, Eagle River, New Holstein,
  Sturgeon Bay and Two Rivers.  WPPI has entered into an agreement to
  buy power from another Wisconsin utility during the period 1997 to

                                    -7-
<PAGE>
  2009.  Also, the Company has negotiated a new power supply agreement
  with the City of Wisconsin Rapids. 
  
       Although 12% of electric revenues come from sales to twenty paper
  mills, resulting in a relatively high and favorable load factor, there
  is no single customer or small group of customers, the loss of which
  would have a materially adverse effect on the electric business of the
  Company.    
  
       In August of 1994, the Company received approval from the PSCW to
  construct a portion of a jointly owned 138 Kv transmission line
  extending from New London to Stevens Point.  The Company's share of
  the sixty mile transmission project will cost approximately $14.9
  million; the remaining $9.6 million cost of the project is the
  responsibility of WEPCO and WP&L.  Completion of the project is
  expected by early 1997.  In the same order, the PSCW denied an
  application by WPPI to build and own the project facilities as a means
  to reduce its overall power supply costs.  The Company, WEPCO and WP&L
  offered, and were ultimately ordered, to file Network Transmission
  Service ("NTS") tariffs with the FERC that would offer comparable use
  on their transmission systems.  The Company tendered its NTS tariff for
  filing with the FERC in September of 1994.  Currently, the NTS tariff
  is under review by the FERC and intervenors.
  
       The Company also is waiting for a ruling from the PSCW regarding
  the Wausau to Abbotsford transmission project, which is part of a
  larger transmission interface project with Northern States Power
  Company, consisting of the rebuild of approximately twenty-three miles
  of 115 Kv transmission line.  The cost of the project is estimated to
  be $4.2 million. 
  
       Applications for relicensing of the Company's Caldron Falls, High
  Falls, Johnson Falls, Sandstone Rapids, Potato Rapids, Peshtigo, Grand
  Rapids and Jersey projects were submitted to the FERC in December of
  1991.  These licenses, representing 30 megawatts of hydroelectric
  generating capacity, expired in December of 1993.  Since the FERC had
  not considered the Company's applications at the license expiration
  dates, the licenses have been extended on an annual basis until FERC
  acts on the applications.  Application to the FERC for relicensing of
  the Company's Wausau Project was submitted in June of 1993.  The
  license for this project expires in June of 1995 and represents 5,400
  kilowatts of capacity.
  
       In the fall of 1994, the PSCW initiated a proceeding to assess
  the future of utility regulation in Wisconsin and to investigate the
  structure necessary for utilities to compete in the new electric
  marketplace.  Public meetings have been held to identify the relevant
  issues.  This matter is discussed in more detail in Part I, Item 1E,
  REGULATORY MATTERS, at page 20.   
  
       Electric research and development expenditures totaled
  $2.3 million for 1994, $2.1 million for 1993 and $2.0 million for
  1992.  These expenditures were made for Company sponsored projects and
  were primarily charged to electric operations.

                           C.  GAS OPERATIONS
  
       GENERAL MATTERS.  At December 31, 1994, the Company provided
  natural gas distribution service to 191,551 customers in 138 cities,
  villages and towns in Northeastern Wisconsin and 4,998 customers in
  and around Menominee, Michigan.  The principal Wisconsin cities served
  include Green Bay, Oshkosh, Sheboygan, Marinette, Two Rivers, Stevens
  Point and Rhinelander.    
  
       The Company transported 58,508,511 dekatherms of gas of which
  34,757,372 dekatherms were for resale during the year ended
  December 31, 1994.  At the end of 1994, the Company had 117 end-user
  customers who purchased their gas directly from suppliers and
  contracted with transporters, including the Company, to transport the
  gas to their points of use.  A total of 23,751,139 dekatherms was
  transported for these customers.  During 1994, several transportation
  customers returned to purchasing their gas requirements from the
  Company.  Load loss due to fuel switching has been minor because
  customers have been able to purchase transportation gas from suppliers
  at competitive prices.
  
       Since the Company has a purchased gas adjustment provision as
  part of its customer rates, it recovers all of its purchased gas costs
  from customers.  This allows the Company to receive the same margin
  (gas revenues less cost of gas) on therm sales to customers who
  purchase natural gas from the Company as it receives from
  transportation customers. 
  
       The Company retains a gas supply consultant who assists in
  creating a gas supply portfolio to match its gas load profile at the
  lowest reasonable cost.  The portfolio is based on twenty-year gas
  peak day and annual sales forecasts and is structured to place the
  Company in an optimum gas purchasing position.  The Company has
  entered into seventeen gas supply contracts with fourteen suppliers
  with terms from five months to six years with domestic suppliers and
  ten years with Canadian suppliers.  There are nine years remaining on
  the contracts with Canadian suppliers.  The large majority of gas is
  competitively priced based on a monthly spot price index.  The gas
  supply contracts contain a gas inventory charge as well as corporate
  warranties to assure gas deliverability for the term of the contract.
  
       Peak day design requirements of 340,777 dekatherms per day is
  based on a 1994-1995 peak day forecast at -20 degrees Fahrenheit.  An
  additional 11,295 dekatherms per day, or 3.3%, of reserve capacity
  allows for growth and any unforeseen needs.  Peak day requirements
  will be served by 117,657 dekatherms per day from transportation gas,
  and 223,120 dekatherms per day from storage gas.  The Company has
  access to eleven BCF of storage capacity in Michigan.  Storage gas is
  purchased and stored during the summer for redelivery during the
  heating season. The Company has purchased 0.1 BCF of underground salt
  dome storage in Louisiana to protect against a supply area gas
  shortage.

                                    -11-
<PAGE>
       The Company transports gas from Louisiana, the Gulf of Mexico,
  the Texas-Oklahoma Panhandle area and Canada under contracts with ANR
  Pipeline Company ("ANR") for domestic gas and Viking Gas Transmission
  Company ("Viking") for Canadian supplies.  On November 1, 1993, FERC
  Order 636 became effective for ANR.  Order 636 prohibits pipeline
  companies, such as ANR, from bundling gas merchant services with
  transportation services.  Thus, Order 636 shifts gas supply
  responsibilities to local distribution companies, such as the Company,
  while the pipeline companies continue to transport gas owned by
  others.  Pipeline transportation rates are governed by tariffs which
  are subject to adjustment by the pipeline companies with the approval
  of the FERC.  As a result of restructuring under Order 636, effective
  November 1, 1993, the Company contracted for its pro rata share of
  pipeline capacity from each of ANR's three supply areas:  Southeast,
  Southwest, and Canada.  The initial term of each contract was for ten
  years with the right to extend in five-year increments.  In addition,
  the Company has preexisting capacity on Viking for delivery of
  Canadian gas with a term of four years with a right to extend.
  
       Order 636 mandates a straight fixed variable rate design which
  loads all fixed costs into the reservation charge.  Based on rates
  effective May 1, 1994, pipeline company reservation charges for 1995
  will total approximately $41.3 million.  The Company also has a no-
  notice service to accommodate load swings caused by unexpected system
  requirements.     
   
       On December 30, 1994, in FERC Docket No. TM 95-3-48-000, ANR
  filed its sixth annual reconciliation of the take-or-pay
  buyout/buydown costs recovered through monthly charges.  These costs,
  which represent 75% of ANR's total take-or-pay buyout/buydown costs
  paid to their gas suppliers, are being passed on to ANR's customers,
  including the Company.  The Company's remaining fixed charge
  obligation for the two take-or-pay dockets still outstanding is
  $41,930.  Monthly fixed charge payments and volumetric payments are
  scheduled to be made through April 1998.  All such costs are expected
  to be recovered from customers pursuant to established policies of the
  PSCW.
  
       ANR, as a result of its FERC Order 636 compliance filing, will
  recover various transition costs from its customers, including the
  Company.  The Company expects to recover ANR transition costs in
  future customer rates.  These costs include purchased gas adjustment
  costs of which the Company's share is approximately $3.7 million.  In
  addition, ANR has upstream pipeline capacity costs of between
  $85 million and $275 million of which the Company's share is
  approximately 10%.  The exact amount cannot be determined at this
  time. 
  
       The Company is currently being billed for ANR's above-market
  costs of gas purchases from the Dakota Gasification Plant.  The
  potential total amount of these billings is undetermined at this time. 
  The 1994 allocation of these costs was $3.2 million, and the 1995
  allocation is expected to be $3.3 million.  The Company, as part of
  the Wisconsin Distributors Group ("WDG"), is contesting the legality

                                    -12-
<PAGE>
  of the Dakota Gasification Plant costs provision and is paying these
  costs under protest subject to refund.  A hearing before the District
  of Columbia Circuit Court could take place in 1995.
  
       WPSR, the parent of the Company, has established a non-regulated
  subsidiary, WPS Energy Services, Inc., to market gas supply services
  to transportation customers.
  
       The Company is a member of the WDG which utilizes a Washington,
  D.C. legal counsel to monitor FERC activities and advise the group. 
  The group files testimony and interventions in cases that impact its
  members.  The Company is also advised by the same Washington, D.C.
  legal counsel.  The Company files interventions in cases to protect
  its interests as they may be different from the group.
  
       All of the Company's Wisconsin retail natural gas rates contain a
  purchased gas adjustment clause which provides for tracking changes
  for wholesale costs and an annual true-up of such costs.  The PSCW
  reaffirmed this purchased gas adjustment clause/true-up mechanism in
  the Company s 1994 rate order.  The Company's Michigan retail rates
  include a gas cost recovery plan under procedures authorized by the
  Michigan Public Service Commission ("MPSC") in 1983.  Both the PSCW
  and the MPSC have approved mechanisms to allow for full recovery of
  take-or-pay and transition related costs which the FERC has authorized
  ANR to pass on to its customers.
   
       The Company is aggressively seeking new natural gas customers
  resulting in the addition of about 6,557 new customers in 1994. 
  Growth in natural gas customers results from adding new customers in
  existing service areas and from the acquisition of new natural gas
  distribution franchises.  At December 31, 1994, five applications for
  new gas distribution franchises were pending before the PSCW.
  
       The Company uses gas for power generation in peaking turbines and
  for ignition and flame stabilization at its Weston Unit 3 and Pulliam
  generating plants.
  
       One large industrial customer is in a geographical location which
  would allow for its direct connection to the ANR system.  A special
  rate designed to keep this customer on the Company distribution system
  has been approved by the PSCW.  The customer has requested a bypass to
  connect directly to the ANR system, but remains a Company
  transportation customer.  There is no single customer or small group
  of customers, the loss of which would have a materially adverse effect
  on the natural gas business of the Company.

                         D.  ENVIRONMENTAL MATTERS   
  
       GENERAL MATTERS.  The Company is subject to regulation with
  regard to the impact of its operations on air and water quality and
  solid waste disposal, and may be subject to regulation with regard to
  other environmental considerations by various federal, state and local
  authorities.  The application of federal and state restrictions to
  protect the environment involves or may involve review, certification
  or issuance of permits by various federal and state authorities,
  including the U. S. Environmental Protection Agency ("EPA") and the
  Wisconsin Department of Natural Resources ("DNR").  Such restrictions,
  particularly in regard to emissions into the air and water and solid
  waste disposal, may limit, prevent or substantially increase the cost
  of the operation of the Company's generating facilities and may
  require substantial investments in new equipment at existing
  installations.  They may also require substantial investments for
  proposed new projects and may delay or prevent authorization and
  completion of the projects.  The Company cannot forecast other effects
  of all such regulation upon its generating, transmission and other
  facilities, or its operations, but believes that it is presently
  meeting existing requirements.
  
       AIR QUALITY.  The plants which the Company operates are in
  compliance with all current sulfur dioxide and nitrogen oxide emission
  standards.
  
       The Federal Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990 ("Act") were enacted
  in 1990.  The Act requires reductions in sulfur dioxide in 1995
  (Phase I) to meet limitations based on an emission rate of 2.5 pounds
  per million BTUs multiplied by a historical generation baseline for
  Pulliam Unit 8 and Edgewater Unit 4 generating units.  The Act
  requires further reductions beginning in the year 2000 (Phase II). 
  These limits are set based on an emission rate of 1.2 pounds per
  million BTUs multiplied by a historical generation baseline for all
  generating units.  The Company's generating facilities met the year
  2000 standard in 1994.  The Company has achieved compliance with
  Wisconsin and federal sulfur dioxide emission limitations by switching
  to low sulfur coal. 
  
       Because of the emission allowance system included in the Act,
  operations during Phase I are expected to produce surplus allowances
  which are expected to be available to aid in compliance with the
  requirements of Phase II.  To the extent the Company determines that
  it will have allowances available beyond its own requirements in both
  Phase I and Phase II, it will consider the sale of these excess
  allowances.  The PSCW has ordered that profits from the sale of
  allowances must be used to benefit utility customers.   
  
       The Act also requires the installation of low nitrogen oxide
  burners on several units.  Low nitrogen oxide burners were installed
  at Pulliam Unit 8 early in 1994.  Phase I of the Act allows units
  smaller than 100 megawatts, such as Pulliam Unit 7, to be designated
  Phase I units, thus building up sulfur dioxide credits.  Having made
  this election, low nitrogen oxide burners were installed at Pulliam

                                    -16-
<PAGE>
  Unit 7 in 1994.  Expenditure of $15 million to $25 million are
  projected through 1999 to assure continued federal and Wisconsin
  emission compliance under all normal operating conditions at Pulliam
  and Weston.  Based on past experience, it is anticipated that
  expenditures related to sulfur dioxide and nitrogen oxide emission
  compliance will be recoverable in customer rates.
  
       Air toxic provisions in the Act will not be applied until the EPA
  conducts a three-year study to determine if those standards need to be
  applied to utilities.     
   
       WATER QUALITY.  The Company is subject to regulation by the EPA
  and the DNR with respect to thermal and other discharges from the
  Company's power plants into Lake Michigan and other waters of
  Wisconsin.  Permits were reissued to the Company for its Pulliam and
  Weston power plants.  Various portions of those permits were
  challenged.  These challenges have not been formally resolved,
  although many of the issues raised in the challenges have been
  resolved through informal discussions with the DNR, additional testing
  by the Company and regulatory changes.  Under Wisconsin law, the
  challenged portions of the permits are stayed, and the administrative
  review process is completed.  It is not anticipated that any of the
  outstanding issues will have a material cost associated with them.
  
       GAS PLANT CLEANUP.  The Company is currently investigating the
  need for environmental cleanup of eight manufactured gas plant sites
  which it previously operated.  The Company engaged an environmental
  consultant to develop cleanup cost estimates for the two sites at
  which Phase II site investigations have been completed.  The cleanup
  cost estimates for the Stevens Point and the Oshkosh sites are
  $1.7 million and $2.6 million, respectively.  With respect to
  Stevens Point, the estimate assumes excavation of contaminated soils,
  thermal treatment of soils, disposal of treatment residuals, on-site
  groundwater extraction and treatment and post-cleanup monitoring for
  twenty-five years.  The cost estimate for the Oshkosh site assumes, in
  addition to those items noted for Stevens Point, removal and disposal
  of contaminated river sediments.  The consultant has yet to perform
  detailed investigations of the remaining six sites, and comparable
  information on these sites is not available.   
  
       The Company used the estimates for these two sites as a basis for
  making projections on cleanup costs at the other sites.  Six of the
  eight sites are located adjacent to rivers.  Using the Oshkosh cleanup
  estimate, which includes remediation of contaminated river sediments,
  and assuming all six sites have sediment contamination, and using the
  Stevens Point estimate for the two sites not adjacent to rivers, the
  range of future investigation and cleanup costs for all eight sites is
  estimated to be from $14.8 million to $29.3 million.  Remediation
  expenditures would be made over the next thirty-four years.  The
  Company has recorded as a liability with an offsetting deferred
  charge, i.e., a regulatory asset, of $26.9 million, which represents
  the Company's current estimate of cleanup costs for all eight sites. 
  Based on discussions with regulators and a recent rate order in
  Wisconsin, management believes that these costs, but not the carrying

                                    -17-
<PAGE>
  costs associated with the deferred charges, will be recoverable in
  future customer rates. 
  
       As additional detailed investigations are completed, three having
  been initiated in 1994, these estimates will be adjusted to reflect
  specific site data.  These adjustments could be significant.  Other
  factors that can affect these estimates are changes in remedial
  technology and regulatory requirements.  The estimates presented above
  do not take into consideration any recovery from insurance carriers or
  other third parties which the Company is pursuing. 
  
       See also Part I, Item 3, LEGAL PROCEEDINGS, at page 24, for
  discussion of the Sheboygan Gas Plant and Oshkosh Gas Plant sites.
  
       OTHER SOLID WASTE DISPOSAL.  On December 1, 1986, the Company
  received notice from EPA-Region V that it was one of 832 potentially
  responsible parties ("PRP") for the cleanup of the Maxey Flats Waste
  Disposal Site.  Documents obtained to date indicate that the Company
  contributed 0.0162% of the waste disposed of at the site.  A remedial
  investigation and feasibility study has been completed.  At this time,
  the cost of the remedial action and EPA oversight is estimated to be
  about $77.5 million.  The EPA has offered a buyout agreement to
  de minimis PRPs.  Although a final agreement has not been executed,
  the Company's buyout cost will be about $28,000.  While liability for
  cleanup under the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation
  and Liability Act ("Superfund") program is joint and several, the
  amounts paid by the PRPs are usually related to their volumetric
  contribution of waste to the site.  
  
       In November of 1986, the Company was notified by the DNR that it
  was one of the several PRPs involved in the Holtz & Krause Landfill
  located in Wausau, Wisconsin.  The Company disposed of 12,516 cubic
  yards of non-hazardous office waste and construction debris at the
  site.  This represents 1.02% of the total amount of waste at the site. 
  The landfill is currently being addressed only by the DNR.  The
  current work is not being conducted as part of the EPA's Superfund
  program.  The DNR has selected a remedy which is estimated to cost a
  total of $11 million to $12 million.  The DNR has agreed to contribute
  approximately $4.5 million toward the remedy.  Also, the county in
  which the landfill is located has adopted a surcharge on the waste
  disposal fee charged at the county's landfill to raise funds to assist
  in the remediation.  Clean Sites, Inc., a neutral cost allocation
  expert, was retained by the Holtz & Krause PRP Group to develop an
  allocation.  The amount to be allocated to the Company, $37,163, was
  paid to the cleanup fund in October of 1993.  The DNR has indicated
  that it will pursue a cost-recovery action against entities that do
  not settle with the Holtz & Krause PRP Group.  In 1994, the Company
  entered into a Consent Decree that acknowledges the payment of the
  settlement amount, requires the settling parties to clean up the site
  and requires the state to pay its agreed upon contribution.  In
  addition, the Company entered into a "buyout" agreement with the
  larger contributors of waste to the site in which the larger
  contributors agreed to indemnify the Company for any cost overruns up
  to a total site remedial cost of $20 million.  If site remedial costs

                                    -18-
<PAGE>
  exceed $20 million, the cost allocation may be reopened.  Most of the
  site work was completed in 1994.    
  
       In March of 1987, the Company was notified by the EPA that it was
  a PRP for the cost of cleaning up the Rose Chemical site in Holden,
  Missouri.  Based on records that are available, a small amount of
  polychlorinated biphenyl material, about 39,000 pounds, was sent to
  the site.  At this time, the Company has signed a participation
  agreement for the cleanup and contributed $60,192 which is based on
  the volumetric contribution of waste and the expected total cleanup
  cost.
   
       In November of 1988, the Company received notice from the DNR
  that the Sherman Street property located in Wausau, Wisconsin, had
  levels of lead contamination present.  Based on an investigation
  conducted by a neighboring business, Wausau Steel, it appears that
  this contamination originates on an adjacent Wausau Steel property. 
  The cleanup of the property by Wausau Steel has been completed,
  pending DNR approval.
  
       In January 1995, the Company was notified that the EPA was
  seeking to recover $775,442 from several companies, not including the
  Company, that sent waste drums to the J. K. Drum site in New London,
  Wisconsin.  One of the companies notified by EPA requested the Company
  to join a group to negotiate a settlement with the EPA.  The Company's
  records indicate that it contributed drums to the site which it
  believes were empty.  The Company is evaluating a response to the
  notice.
  
  
                          E.  REGULATORY MATTERS
  
       GENERAL MATTERS.   Utility rates, service and securities issues
  of the Company are subject to regulation by the PSCW and the MPSC, and
  the Company is subject to regulation of its wholesale electric rates,
  hydroelectric projects and certain other matters by the FERC.  It is
  also subject to limited regulation by local authorities.  The Company
  follows Statement of Financial Accounting Standard No. 71, Accounting
  for the Effects of Certain Types of Regulation, and its financial
  statements reflect the effects of the different ratemaking principles
  of the various jurisdictions.  These include the PSCW, 89% of
  revenues, the MPSC, 2% of revenues and FERC, 9% of revenues.  The
  operation of Kewaunee is subject to the jurisdiction of the
  U. S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission.
  
       In the Wisconsin jurisdiction, the rate process has been changed
  effective in 1995 such that retail electric and natural gas rates will
  be set every two years, rather than annually as has been the practice
  in the past.  The earliest that the rates which took effect January 1,
  1995 could change would be for the year 1997.  Customer rates are set
  based on forecasted expenses and capital costs. 
  
       Wisconsin retail rates include an electric fuel-adjustment clause
  based on a "cost variance range approach."  This range is based on a

                                    -19-
<PAGE>
  specific estimated fuel cost for the next year.  If actual fuel costs
  fall outside this range, a hearing may be held and an adjustment to
  future rates may result.  Automatic fuel-adjustment clauses are used
  for FERC wholesale-electric and Michigan retail-electric portions of
  the Company's business.  The Company has a purchased gas adjustment
  clause which allows it to pass on to all classes of gas customers
  changes in the cost of gas purchased from its suppliers, subject to
  PSCW and MPSC review. 
  
       CUSTOMER RATE MATTERS.  In the Wisconsin jurisdiction, a
  $17.4 million, or 4% electric rate reduction, and a $1 million, or .6%
  natural gas rate increase, covering a one-year period, became
  effective on January 1, 1994.  Electric revenues were also reduced
  $2 million, or .5% in May of 1994 as a result of reduced fuel costs. 
  Customer rates for 1994 reflected an authorized rate of return of
  11.3% on common equity, down from 12.3% in 1993.  The return on common
  equity, when adjusted to reflect allowed earnings on deferred
  investment tax credits, amounted to 11.9% and 13.0%, respectively, for
  the years 1994 and 1993.
   
       On December 19, 1994, the PSCW approved an electric rate
  reduction of $10.9 million, or 2.6% to be effective on January 1, 1995
  for the years 1995 and 1996.  Natural gas rates remained unchanged. 
  The rates for 1995 and 1996 reflect an authorized rate of return on
  common equity of 11.5% which when adjusted to reflect allowed earnings
  on deferred investment tax credits is 12.18%.  A capital structure
  including 54% common equity was also approved.     
  
       No changes were made to Michigan electric and gas rates during
  1994 other than through the fuel adjustment clauses. Likewise,
  wholesale electric rates remained unchanged except for reductions
  related to fuel costs.    
  
       PSCW INDUSTRY RESTRUCTURING PROCEEDING.  On September 8, 1994,
  the PSCW commenced a proceeding to consider the probable costs and
  benefits of changing the structure and regulation of the electric
  utility industry in Wisconsin.  Changes in federal law, improvements
  in the electric transmission system and technological advances suggest
  that now is the time to prepare for, capture and maximize the benefits
  of a changing and more market-oriented industry.  
  
       At its January 24, 1995 meeting, the PSCW identified the primary
  objectives of the proceeding to be the creation of a system that sends
  accurate price signals to customers resulting in the most economically
  efficient use of resources; the creation of a system which maximizes,
  within the public interest, the number and diversity of service
  offerings to customers; and the creation of a system in which
  providers maximize economic efficiency and environmental stewardship.  
  
       The PSCW has created an Advisory Committee ("Committee"),
  consisting of twenty-two members, representing various constituencies,
  including a Company member, which will examine every aspect of
  electric service and determine which functions, if any, should be
  performed by a competitive market and identify specific transitional

                                    -20-
<PAGE>
  mechanisms that may be needed to create a workable competitive market
  for these services.  For services that have natural monopoly
  characteristics, the Committee will explore whether new institutional
  or regulatory policies could further benefit the public.  
  
       Following a period that includes public comment on the
  Committee's recommendations, the Committee will submit its recommended
  alternatives to the PSCW which will review the recommendations along
  with outside comments before deciding the appropriate public policy
  and commencing with implementation of its decision.  The work of the
  Committee is intended to be finished in time to allow the PSCW to
  prepare a final report for the legislature on recommendations for
  legislative changes by December 1, 1995.
  
       ACCOUNTING DEVELOPMENTS.  See Part II, Item 7, MANAGEMENT'S
  DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF
  OPERATION, at page 29, for a discussion of accounting developments. 
  
       In addition, the staff of the U. S. Securities and Exchange
  Commission has questioned certain of the current accounting practices
  of the electric utility industry, including those of the Company,
  regarding the recognition, measurement and classification of nuclear
  decommissioning costs for nuclear generation facilities in the
  financial statements of electric utilities.  In response to these
  questions, the Financial Accounting Standards Board has agreed to
  review the accounting for nuclear decommissioning costs.  If current
  electric utility industry accounting practices for such
  decommissioning are changed:  (1) the annual provisions for
  decommissioning could increase; and (2) the estimated cost for
  decommissioning could be recorded as a liability rather than as
  accumulated depreciation.  The Company does not believe that such
  changes, if required, would have an adverse effect on results of
  operations due to its current and future ability to recover
  decommissioning costs through customer rates.
  
       The PSCW certified new straight-line depreciation rates which
  became effective January 1, 1994 concurrent with the implementation of
  new customer rates.  The result was a reduction in annual depreciation
  expense of approximately $5.8 million.  
  
       Regulatory assets represent probable future revenue associated
  with certain costs which will be recovered from customers through the
  ratemaking process.  Regulatory liabilities represent costs previously
  collected that are refundable in future rates.  At December 31, 1994,
  regulatory assets and liabilities amounted to $109.1 million and
  $66.0 million, respectively.  Based on prior and current rate
  treatment of such deferred charges, management believes it is probable
  that the Company will continue to recover these costs from ratepayers. 
  Pursuant to a PSCW rate order, effective January 1, 1995, the Company
  is to recover approximately $23.6 million of deferred regulatory costs
  each year.
  
       DIVIDEND RESTRICTIONS.  The Company is restricted by a PSCW order
  to paying normal dividends of no more than 109% of the previous year's

                                    -21-
<PAGE>
  common stock dividend without prior notice to the PSCW.  Also,
  Wisconsin law prohibits the Company from making loans to WPSR and its
  non-regulated subsidiaries and from guaranteeing their obligations.   
  
  
                         F.  CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS
   
       Anticipated construction expenditures for 1995 are $84.2 million,
  of which $53.1 million, $1.3 million, $24.4 million, and $5.4 million
  are for electric construction, nuclear fuel, gas construction, and
  other construction expenditures, respectively.   Approximately 60% of
  the expenditures for 1995, and 97% of the anticipated total capital
  expenditures of $150.6 million during 1996 and 1997, are expected to
  be financed through internal sources.  The Company does not expect to
  sell equity or long-term debt during this period.  Expenditures
  related to the REC are not reflected in the above amounts because a
  subsidiary of the Company anticipates entering into a project
  financing arrangement with respect to the $169 million facility.
  
  
                               G. EMPLOYEES
  
       At December 31, 1994, the Company employed 2,572 persons.  Of
  this number, 2,093 and 479 were considered electric and gas utility
  employees, respectively.
     
       Approximately 1,070 the Company employees are represented by
  Local 310 of the International Union of Operating Engineers ("Union"). 
  During 1994, the Union ratified a new contract with the Company which
  provides for work force flexibility in that, for the duration of the
  contract, Union employees can perform traditional union work across
  craft lines, perform non-union work and perform work traditionally
  performed by contractors; and non-union employees can perform some
  union work.   The current contract runs through October of 1997. 
  There has never been a strike against the Company by its employees.

electric transmission and distribution lines.  Gas properties include

                                    -23-
<PAGE>
approximately 3,532 miles of main, 70 gate and city regulator stations
and 181,078 services.  All gas facilities are located in Wisconsin
except for distribution facilities in and near the city of Menominee,
Michigan.    
   
     Substantially all of the Company's utility plant is subject to a
first mortgage lien.


ITEM 3.  LEGAL PROCEEDINGS  

     SHEBOYGAN GAS PLANT.  In November of 1990, the Company was
notified by the DNR that it may be a PRP for environmental
contamination found on property next to the Sheboygan River previously
used by the Company for the gasification of coal in the City of
Sheboygan, Wisconsin (the "Sheboygan II Gas Plant").  The Company last
used the property for this purpose in approximately 1930.  In 1966,
the property was sold and is now owned by the City of Sheboygan.  The
DNR has offered the Company the opportunity to investigate and
remediate the property under an agreement with the State of Wisconsin
as opposed to having the site handled by the EPA as part of the larger
Sheboygan River and Harbor Superfund site.  The Company, the City of
Sheboygan and the State of Wisconsin have negotiated an agreement for
performing the work, and therefore, Wisconsin, and not the EPA, will
be handling this matter.

     An initial study was completed on the site which confirmed the
presence of contaminants that appear to be related to the Sheboygan II
Gas Plant.  A follow-up investigation was recommended by the
environmental consultant to determine more precisely the scope of the
contamination and to determine if any contamination is migrating from
off-site.  The Company is awaiting approval from the DNR for the
additional work.  After the follow-up investigation is completed, the
City of Sheboygan and the Company will negotiate an allocation of the
costs associated with cleanup of the site.  Based on the initial
study, and a more detailed investigation of the Company's former
Oshkosh site, it is believed that the cost of cleanup for the
Sheboygan II Gas Plant site could be as much as $2.6 million.  The
estimates presented above do not take into consideration any recovery
from insurance carriers or other third parties which the Company is
pursuing.

     OSHKOSH GAS PLANT.  In April of 1992, the Company received an
order from the DNR directing it to complete an investigation and
implement remedial activities on property owned by the Company in the
City of Oshkosh, Wisconsin.  Previously, the Company had operated a
manufactured gas plant on the property from 1883 until 1946.  A
challenge to the order was filed on May 8, 1992, and the Company and
the DNR have negotiated the terms of a consent order.  An
environmental consultant conducted an investigation in late 1993 and a
more detailed investigation in 1994.  Based on the more detailed
investigation, the cost of remediation is estimated to be as much as
$2.6 million.  Additional studies are planned to define further the
area of contamination (primary river sediments).  The results of these

                                    -24-
<PAGE>
studies may affect the cost estimate for remediation based on the
nature and extent of contamination.  The City of Oshkosh has claimed
that contaminated groundwater from the former gas plant property has
migrated onto city-owned land.  The Company has agreed to stay the
statute of limitations that may be applicable to the City of Oshkosh's
claim in order to avoid the filing of a lawsuit by the City of
Oshkosh.  The Company is continuing to evaluate the validity of the
City of Oshkosh's claim as additional data is received.  The estimates
presented above do not take into consideration any recovery from
insurance carriers or other third parties which the Company is
pursuing.      
   
     Incorporated herein by reference are the descriptions of the
various proceedings relating to environmental matters described under
D.  ENVIRONMENTAL MATTERS, at pages 16 through 19, Item 1.


ITEM 4.  SUBMISSION OF MATTERS TO A VOTE OF SECURITY HOLDERS

ITEM 5. MARKET FOR REGISTRANT'S COMMON EQUITY AND RELATED
        STOCKHOLDER MATTERS

        The common stock of the Company has been wholly owned by WPSR
since the reorganization which was effective September 1, 1994 as
described in Part I, Item 1A, GENERAL, at page 1.

        The Company is restricted by a PSCW order to paying normal
dividends of no more than 109% of the previous year's common stock
dividend without prior notice to the PSCW.  Also, Wisconsin law
prohibits the Company from making loans to WPSR and its non-regulated
subsidiaries and from guaranteeing their obligations.

        WPSR paid a normal dividend for the fourth quarter of 1994 in the
amount of $.455 per share.  In addition, WPSR paid special dividends
in September and December of 1994 of $3.9 million and $13.0 million,
respectively.

     paid by the Company to public shareholders.  As a result of the
     reorganization, the fourth quarter dividend for 1994 was paid to public
     shareholders by WPSR.

ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION
        AND RESULTS OF OPERATION


RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

OVERVIEW OF 1994 COMPARED TO 1993

Earnings on common stock declined from $58.9 million in 1993 to
$52.7 million in 1994, or 10.5%.  The most significant reason for this
decrease was a Public Service Commission of Wisconsin ("PSCW") order
decreasing the authorized return on common equity for the Company from
12.3% to 11.3%, thereby reducing earnings approximately $3.8 million.

1994 COMPARED TO 1993

Electric margins (revenues less electric fuel expense and purchased
power) declined by $17.3 million, or 5.0%, due primarily to reduced
electric rates.

Electric operating revenues decreased $12.4 million, or 2.5%,
primarily due to a 4.2% reduction in Wisconsin retail rates that took
effect January 1, 1994.  Electric rates also were reduced .5% in May
1994 as a result of reduced fuel costs.  These decreases were
partially offset by a 4.0% increase in kilowatt-hour ("kwh") sales. 
Residential, commercial and industrial kwh sales increased 2.4% and
4.9%, respectively, due to a warmer summer and customer growth. 
Wholesale kwh sales increased 3.0%.

Electric fuels and purchases increased $4.9 million, or 3.4%,
reflecting increased sales, offset in part by reduced production
costs.  Electric production fuels decreased $3.0 million, or 2.7%,
even though generation was up 1.3%.  This decrease in fuel costs per
kwh of 5.4% primarily was the result of purchasing less expensive coal
on the spot market.  Purchased power costs were higher by
$7.9 million, or 25.8%.  This was the result of a 19.9% increase in
kwh purchases, due to the severe cold weather in the first quarter of
the year, which forced WPSC to purchase expensive spot market
electricity, and the Soo Line railroad strike during the second half
of the year which impacted WPSC s ability to operate its coal-fired
units.

Gas margins (revenues less the cost of gas) increased by $1.7 million,
or 3.6%, due to customer growth.  The PSCW allows WPSC to pass on to
its customers, through a purchased gas adjustment clause, changes in
the cost of gas.

Maintenance expense decreased $1.6 million, or 3.1%, due to lower
maintenance activity at the Kewaunee Nuclear Power Plant ("Kewaunee")
and to less electric transmission and distribution maintenance.
Depreciation and decommissioning expense decreased $4.2 million, or
7.0%.  The primary cause was a rate order from the PSCW which took
effect January 1, 1994 reducing the annual depreciation provision by

                                    -29-
<PAGE>
an estimated $5.8 million.  This was offset by higher decommissioning
expense of approximately $1.1 million.

Federal and state income taxes decreased $3.0 million, or 9.1%, due to
lower earnings.

1993 COMPARED TO 1992

Electric operating revenues increased $15.6 million, or 3.3%.  This
increase was the result of a 4.2% increase in kwh sales and a 2.1%
rate increase for WPSC's Wisconsin retail customers that was effective
January 1, 1993.  This was partially offset by rate reductions
totaling $1.1 million in September and November 1993 for Wisconsin
retail customers due to reduced fuel costs.  Residential sales
increased $8.9 million, or 5.7%, due primarily to warmer summer
weather.  Commercial and industrial sales rose $13.3 million, or 5.3%,
reflecting customer growth and the impact of the warmer weather. 
Wholesale sales decreased $4.5 million, or 7.4%, due to an average
rate reduction for this customer class of 6.7%.

Electric production fuel costs decreased $9.8 million, or 7.9%, even
though electric generation was up 2.1%.  This decrease primarily was
the result of less expensive coal which was purchased on the spot
market.  Such purchases decreased overall coal-related costs per kwh
by 11.8% and reduced coal costs by approximately $14.2 million between
years.  

Gas operating revenues increased $30.2 million, or 19.2%.  This
increase primarily is due to a 10.1% increase in the cost of gas
($12.2 million), reflecting spot market volatility, a 3.2% increase in
heating-degree days ($12.5 million) and a 2.3% Wisconsin retail rate
increase ($5.5 million) effective January 1, 1993.  Residential gas
revenues increased $17.3 million, and commercial and industrial gas
revenues increased $14.6 million. 

Gas purchased for resale increased $23.5 million, or 21.3%, due to
higher gas volumes of 10.4% and to a 10.1% higher average cost of gas
per therm.

Other operating expenses increased $12.7 million, or 9.3%, primarily
due to increased amortization of 1991 coal and associated rail
contract buy-out costs of $2.9 million and increased electric and gas
conservation expenses of $9.7 million.

Maintenance expense increased $5.1 million, or 11.1%, primarily due to
additional maintenance activities at WPSC's coal-fired power plants.

Federal and state income taxes increased $5.9 million, or 21.7%, due
to higher pre-tax income and the effect of an increase in the federal
income tax rate from 34% to 35%, as provided in the Revenue
Reconciliation Act of 1993.

BALANCE SHEET

1994 COMPARED TO 1993

Accrued utility revenues decreased $8.5 million as a result of
unseasonably warm weather experienced in December 1994.

Long-term liabilities increased $20.6 million primarily due to higher
estimates for environmental remediation of $10.4 million and post-
retirement health care costs of $7.0 million.


FINANCIAL CONDITION

The Company requires large investments in capital assets used to
deliver electric and gas services. The Company maintains good
liquidity levels and a financial condition considered to be strong by
analysts.  Internally generated funds closely approximate the
utility's cash requirements.  No external funding difficulties are
anticipated in the future.  Pre-tax interest coverage was 4.2 times
for the year ended December 31, 1994.  WPSC's bond ratings are AA+
(Standard & Poor's), Aa2 (Moody's) and AA+ (Duff & Phelps).

The Company is restricted by a PSCW order to paying normal dividends
of no more than 109% of the previous year's common stock dividend
without prior notice to the PSCW.  Also, Wisconsin law prohibits the
Company from making loans to WPS Resources Corporation (WPSR), the
Company's parent, and its subsidiaries and from guaranteeing their
obligations. 

For the three-year period 1995 to 1997, internally-generated funds at
the Company are expected to lag behind construction expenditures,
which total $235 million, by $38 million.  The Company currently
expects to finance this shortfall in internally generated funds with
short-term debt.  These expenditures are comprised of $148 million for
electric construction, $20 million for nuclear fuel, $48 million for
gas construction and $19 million for other construction expenditures.
These construction costs exclude the Rhinelander Energy Center ("REC")
which will be substantially funded with non-recourse project financing
debt.

The PSCW has approved the REC as the preferred electric generating
project to meet the Company's expanding capacity and energy needs.
This approval followed a competitive bidding process.  The REC will be
built and operated by non-regulated subsidiaries of the Company.  REC
will be a coal-fired, 122-megawatt, $169 million cogeneration facility
which will produce steam and electricity for sale to the Rhinelander
Paper Company and electricity for sale to utility customers.  Before
construction commences, the PSCW must certify that the REC satisfies a
public need.  PSCW approval is expected in the second half of 1995. 
The plant is expected to be placed in service in 1998.

Kewaunee is currently licensed through the year 2013.  Physical
decommissioning is expected to occur during the period 2014 to 2021

                                    -31-
<PAGE>
with additional expenditures being incurred during the period 2022 to
2050.  Decommissioning costs in current dollars are $147 million, and
the undiscounted amount is $785 million.  As of December 31, 1994,
$64.1 million has been placed in external trusts to cover these future
costs.  Management does not anticipate decommissioning to have any
negative impacts on the Company's liquidity or capital resources,
since these costs are currently recovered from customers and funded
through external decommissioning trusts.

The Company received a two-year rate order from the PSCW which became
effective January 1, 1995.  This rate order decreased electric retail
rates by 2.6% and kept retail gas rates at current levels.  This order
also increased the authorized rate of return on common equity from
11.3% to 11.5%.

Statement of Financial Accounting Standards ("SFAS") No. 112,
Employers  Accounting for Post-Employment Benefits, became effective
in 1994.  This statement establishes the accounting and reporting
standard for the estimated cost of benefits provided by an employer to
former or inactive employees after employment but before retirement. 
The effect of this statement was not material.

SFAS No. 115, Accounting for Certain Investments in Debt and Equity
Securities, became effective in 1994.  This statement establishes the
accounting and reporting standard for investments in debt and
marketable equity securities.  This standard primarily impacts nuclear
decommissioning investments.  The effect of this statement was not
material.

SFAS No. 119, Disclosure about Derivative Financial Instruments and
Fair Value of Financial Instruments, also became effective in 1994. 
This statement establishes disclosure requirements for derivatives. 
As of December 31, 1994, the Company had no derivatives.


TRENDS

The Company follows SFAS No. 71, Accounting for the Effects of Certain
Types of Regulation, and its financial statements reflect the effects
of the different ratemaking principles followed by the various
jurisdictions regulating the utility.  These include the PSCW, 89% of
revenues, the Michigan Public Service Commission, 2% of revenues, and
the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission ("FERC"), 9% of revenues.  In
addition, Kewaunee is regulated by the Nuclear Regulatory Commission. 
Environmental matters are primarily governed by the Environmental
Protection Agency and the Wisconsin Department of Natural Resources.

The single most important development in the electric utility industry
is the trend toward increased competition brought about by a
combination of new legislation, changing regulation and market forces. 
Transmission access, mandated by the Energy Policy Act of 1992, 
increased competition in the wholesale power segment of the business
and put pressure on profit margins.  Certain segments of the industry

                                    -32-
<PAGE>
could become deregulated.  Low-cost energy producers, such as the
Company, are in a position to benefit from competitive markets.  

The PSCW has initiated a proceeding to consider restructuring electric
utility regulation in Wisconsin.  Matters to be addressed include:

        -    Whether generation, transmission and distribution functions
             will be allowed to exist together in the same company.

        -    Whether retail wheeling should be allowed.

        -    Whether utilities should be obligated to serve those
             customers who have the ability to choose between alternate
             suppliers.

        -    Whether utilities will be given the ability to price
             services based on market factors rather than the traditional
             regulatory-pricing model.

        -    The treatment of stranded investment in utility plant and
             regulatory assets. 

The Company has accrued $26.9 million for the future environmental
remediation of eight manufactured gas plant sites which it operated
previously.  This accrual is based on studies at two sites and was
used as the basis for projecting costs on the remaining six sites. 
The range of cleanup costs for all eight sites is estimated to be from
$14.8 million to $29.3 million.

These estimates will be adjusted as additional site-specific studies
are completed, three of which are anticipated in 1995.  Factors that
can impact future cost estimates include the volume of contaminated
soil and changes in remedial technology and regulatory requirements. 
A recent Wisconsin rate order provides that these costs may be
recovered from customers over a five-year period after expenditures
are incurred, but that no return on unrecovered costs is permitted.  

The estimated cleanup costs presented do not take into consideration
recovery from insurance carriers or other third parties.  In June
1994, the Wisconsin Supreme Court ("Court") held that insurance
coverage was not available for environmental cleanup costs to the
extent the clean up is done to prevent or mitigate future injury.  The
Court also held that a notification letter from a government agency
about an environmental situation did not constitute a suit, triggering
the insurers'  duty to defend.  The Company is exploring alternative
approaches for pursuing claims against carriers in light of the
decision.

In addition, the Company has been notified that it is a minor
participant in a number of waste disposal site cleanup efforts. 
However, no significant costs are anticipated to clean up these sites.

Federal Clean Air Act Amendments ("Act") were enacted in 1990.  The
Act establishes stringent sulfur dioxide and nitrogen oxide emission

                                    -33-
<PAGE>
limitations.  Wisconsin previously had enacted laws to limit sulfur
emissions.  The Company meets the sulfur dioxide emission standards
scheduled to take effect in the year 2000 as a result of switching to
lower-sulfur fuels.  However, some additional capital expenditures
will be required to upgrade existing equipment and to monitor emission
levels.  These expenditures are estimated to be in the range of
$15 million to $25 million between 1995 and 1999.

The steam generator tubes at Kewaunee are susceptible to corrosion
characteristics seen throughout the nuclear industry.  Annual
inspections are performed to identify degraded tubes which are either
repaired by sleeving or are removed from service by plugging.  The
steam generators were designed with approximately a 15% heat-transfer
margin, meaning that full power should be sustainable with the
equivalent of 15% of the steam generator tubes plugged.  Tube plugging
and the build-up of deposits on the tubes affect the heat-transfer
capability of the steam generators to the point where eventually full
power operation is not possible, and there is a gradual decrease in
the capacity of the plant.  The plant s capacity could be reduced by
as much as 20% by the year 2013.  To date, approximately 12% of the
tubes have been plugged, with no reduction in capacity.  The Company
continues to evaluate the operation of the steam generators without
replacement and appropriate repair strategies, including replacement.
The Company also continues to evaluate and implement initiatives to
improve the performance of Kewaunee which already performs at above-
average levels for the industry.  These initiatives include conversion
from a twelve-month to an eighteen-month refueling and major
maintenance cycle, beginning in the spring of 1995, and numerous other
cost-reduction measures.  These initiatives have resulted in
approximately a 25% reduction in Kewaunee operating and maintenance
costs since 1991.  The Company intends to operate Kewaunee until at
least the expiration of the present operating license in 2013.

In 1995, the Company is initiating a new demand-side management
("DSM") program which involves loans and shared savings.  Prior to
1995, DSM expenditures were recovered from all customers.  The new
program provides that those who benefit from energy-saving programs
will finance them.  As of December 31, 1994, the Company had
$46.5 million of deferred DSM expenditures which will be recovered in
future rates.

Local 310 of the International Union of Operating Engineers,
representing 1,070 of the Company's employees, ratified a new three-
year contract with the Company.  The agreement provides for work force
flexibility in that, for the duration of the contract, Union employees
can perform traditional union work across craft lines, perform non-
union work and perform work traditionally performed by contractors;
and non-union employees can perform some union work.  The flexibility
that this contract provides will allow the Company to more easily
adapt to the changing utility environment.

IMPACT OF INFLATION

Current financial statements are prepared in accordance with generally
accepted accounting principles and report operating results in terms
of historic cost.  They provide a reasonable, objective and
quantifiable statement of financial results, but they do not evaluate
the impact of inflation.  Under rate treatment prescribed by the
utility s regulatory commissions, projected operating costs are
recoverable in revenues.  Because forecasts are prepared assuming
inflation, the majority of inflationary effects on normal operating
costs are recoverable in rates.  However, in these forecasts, the
Company is allowed to recover the historical cost of plant via
depreciation.

Although new rates will not be implemented in 1996 due to the two-year
rate order in the Wisconsin jurisdiction, management believes
inflation will be offset by the impact of customer growth and
increased productivity.

                F.  NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS


(1)  SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES
          
     (a)  BUSINESS - Wisconsin Public Service Corporation ("Company")
          is a public utility operating company engaged in supplying
          electrical energy and natural gas to its customers who are
          located primarily in northeastern Wisconsin and Upper
          Michigan.  The Company follows Statement of Financial
          Accounting Standards ("SFAS") No. 71, Accounting for the
          Effects of Certain Types of Regulation, and its financial
          statements reflect the effects of the different ratemaking
          principles followed by the various jurisdictions regulating
          the company.  These include the Public Service Commission of
          Wisconsin ("PSCW"), 89% of revenues, the Michigan Public
          Service Commission ("MPSC"), 2% of revenues, and the Federal
          Energy Regulatory Commission ("FERC"), 9% of revenues.

     (b)  CORPORATE REORGANIZATION - On September 1, 1994,
          WPS Resources Corporation ("WPSR"), pursuant to a one-for-
          one share exchange, acquired all of the common stock of the
          Company.  As a result, the Company became a wholly-owned
          subsidiary of the WPSR.  

     (c)  CONSOLIDATION - The consolidated financial statements
          include the Company and its wholly-owned subsidiary,
          WPS Leasing, Inc.  All significant intercompany transactions
          and accounts have been eliminated.

     (d)  UTILITY PLANT - Utility plant is stated at the original cost
          of construction which includes an allowance for funds used
          during construction ("AFUDC").  Approximately 50% of retail
          jurisdictional construction work in progress ("CWIP"),
          except for major new generating facilities which earn AFUDC
          on the full amount, is subject to AFUDC using a rate based
          on the Company's overall cost of capital.  For 1994, the
          retail AFUDC rate was approximately 10.1%.

          AFUDC is recorded on wholesale jurisdictional electric
          construction work in progress at debt and equity percentages
          specified in the FERC Uniform System of Accounts.  For 1994,
          this rate was approximately 4.3%.

          Substantially all of the Company's utility plant is subject
          to a first mortgage lien.

     (e)  PROPERTY ADDITIONS, MAINTENANCE AND RETIREMENTS - The cost
          of renewals and betterments of units of property (as
          distinguished from minor items of property) is charged to
          utility plant accounts.  The cost of units of property
          retired, sold or otherwise disposed of, plus removal costs,
          less salvage, is charged to the accumulated provision for
          depreciation.  No profit or loss is recognized in connection

                                    -41-
<PAGE>
          with ordinary retirements of utility property units. 
          Maintenance and repair costs and replacement and renewal of
          items less than units of property are generally charged to
          operating expense.  

          In October 1993, the Company sold, at cost, a 32% interest
          in a combustion turbine to a municipality for $7.8 million.

     (f)  DEPRECIATION - Straight-line composite depreciation expense
          is recorded over the estimated useful life of the property
          and includes estimated salvage and cost of removal.  These
          rates have been approved by the PSCW.  Effective January 1,
          1994, depreciation rates were revised based on new estimates
          which decreased annual depreciation expense by approximately
          $5.8 million.  This decrease was considered in setting
          customer rates.

     (g)  NUCLEAR DECOMMISSIONING - Nuclear decommissioning costs are
          accrued over the estimated service life of the Kewaunee
          Nuclear Power Plant ("Kewaunee"), currently recovered from
          customers in rates and deposited in external trusts.  Such
          costs totaled $4.0, $2.4 and $2.4 million for 1994, 1993 and
          1992, respectively.  In July 1994, the PSCW issued a generic
          order covering utilities with nuclear generation. This order
          standardizes the escalation assumptions used in determining
          nuclear decommissioning liabilities.  The undiscounted
          amount of decommissioning costs estimated to be expended
          between the years 2014 to 2050 are $785 million.  Long-term
          after-tax earnings of 5.5% are assumed.  As a result of this
          change, annual decommissioning costs recovered in customer
          rates in 1995 will be approximately $8.7 million.  As of
          December 31, 1994, the accumulated provision for
          depreciation and decommissioning included accumulated
          provisions for decommissioning totaling $64.1 million. 

          The Company's share of Kewaunee decommissioning costs are
          estimated to be $147 million in current dollars based on a
          site-specific study, performed in 1992, using immediate
          dismantlement as the method of decommissioning.  As of
          December 31, 1994, the external trusts totaled $64.1 million
          and were valued at market. 

          Depreciation expense includes decommissioning costs
          recovered in customer rates and a charge to offset earnings
          from the external trusts.  Trust earnings totaled $2.4, $3.5
          and $3.3 million for the years ended December 31, 1994, 1993
          and 1992, respectively.

                                    -42-

     (h)  NUCLEAR FUEL - The cost of nuclear fuel is amortized to
          electric production fuel expense based on the quantity of
          heat produced for the generation of electric energy by
          Kewaunee.  The costs amortized to electric fuel expense
          (which assume no salvage values for uranium or plutonium)
          include an amount for ultimate disposal and are recovered
          through current rates.  As required by the Nuclear Waste
          Policy Act of 1982, a contract with the Department of Energy
          ("DOE") has been signed, and quarterly payments are being
          made to the DOE for the fuel storage based on generation. 
          Interim storage space for spent nuclear fuel is provided at
          Kewaunee, and expenses associated with this storage are
          recognized as current operating costs.  Currently, there is
          on-site storage capacity for spent fuel through the year
          2013.  As of December 31, 1994 and 1993, the accumulated
          provisions for nuclear fuel totaled $136.5 million and
          $130.0 million, respectively.

     (I)  CASH AND EQUIVALENTS - The Company considers short-term
          investments with an original maturity of three months or
          less to be cash equivalents.

     (j)  REVENUE AND CUSTOMER RECEIVABLES - The Company accrues
          revenues related to electric and gas service, including
          estimated amounts for service rendered but not billed.

          As of December 31, 1994, energy conservation loans to
          customers amounting to $1.7 million are included in customer
          receivables and in investments and other assets.  The
          carrying amount of the loans closely approximates their
          market value.

          Automatic fuel-adjustment clauses are used for FERC
          wholesale-electric and MPSC retail-electric portions of the
          Company s business.  The PSCW retail-electric portion of the
          business uses a  cost variance range approach.   This range
          is based on a specific estimated annual fuel cost.  If the
          Company's actual fuel costs fall outside this range, a
          hearing may be held and an adjustment to future rates may
          result.  The Company has a purchased gas adjustment clause
          which allows it to pass on to all classes of gas customers
          changes in the cost of gas purchased from its suppliers,
          subject to PSCW and MPSC review. 

          The Company is required to provide service and grant credit
          to customers within its defined service territory and is
          precluded from discontinuing service to residential
          customers during certain periods of the year.  The Company
          continually reviews its customers' credit-worthiness and
          obtains deposits or refunds deposits accordingly.  The
          Company is permitted to recover bad debts in utility rates. 

          Approximately 8% of the Company's total revenues are from
          companies in the paper products industry.

     (k)  REGULATORY ASSETS AND LIABILITIES - The Company is subject
          to the provisions of SFAS No. 71, Accounting for the Effects
          of Certain Types of Regulation.  Regulatory assets represent
          probable future revenue associated with certain costs which
          will be recovered from customers through the ratemaking
          process. Regulatory liabilities represent costs previously
          collected that are refundable in future rates.  The
          following regulatory assets and liabilities were reflected
          in the Consolidated Balance Sheets as of December 31:

          ============================================================

          As of December 31, 1994, most of the Company's regulatory
          assets are being recovered through rates charged to
          customers over periods ranging from two to ten years. 
          Pursuant to a PSCW rate order, effective January 1, 1995,
          the Company is to recover approximately $23.6 million of
          regulatory costs in 1995 and 1996.

          Based on prior and current rate treatment of such costs,
          management believes it is probable that the Company will
          continue to recover from ratepayers the deferred charges
          described above.

          See notes (1)(m) and (1)(n) for specific discussion of
          pension and deferred tax regulatory liabilities, and note 6
          for discussion of environmental-remediation deferred costs.

     (l)  INVESTMENTS AND OTHER ASSETS - Investments include various
          immaterial affiliates whose income is included in other
          income and deductions using the equity method of accounting. 

                                    -44-
<PAGE>
          Other assets include prepaid pension assets, operating
          deposits for jointly-owned plants, the cash surrender value
          of life insurance policies and the long-term portion of
          energy conservation loans to customers.

     (m)  EMPLOYEE BENEFIT PLANS - The Company has non-contributory
          retirement plans covering substantially all employees under
          which annual contributions are made to an irrevocable trust
          established to provide retired employees with a monthly
          payment if conditions relating to age and length of service
          have been met.  The plans are fully funded, and no
          contributions were made in 1994, 1993 or 1992.  Prior to
          January 1, 1993, the PSCW required the recognition of the
          funded amounts for ratemaking purposes.  Concurrent with a
          rate order, effective January 1, 1993, the Company began
          recovering pension costs in customer rates under SFAS
          No. 87, Employers  Accounting for Pensions, and began
          returning to ratepayers, over five years, the cumulative
          excess of amounts recovered from customers over SFAS No. 87
          costs.

          The tables below set forth the plans' funded status and
          expense (income).

          The Company also offers medical, dental and life insurance
          benefits to employees, retirees and their dependents.  The
          expenses for active employees are expensed as incurred.

          Prior to 1993, the Company expensed amounts related to post-
          retirement health and welfare plans to the extent that such
          amounts were funded to external trusts.

          Effective January 1, 1993, and concurrent with a rate order,
          the Company adopted SFAS No. 106, Employers' Accounting for
          Post-Retirement Benefits Other Than Pensions, which requires
          the cost of post-retirement benefits for employees to be
          accrued as expense over the period in which the employee
          renders service and becomes eligible to receive benefits. 
          In adopting SFAS No. 106, the Company elected to recognize
          the transition obligation for current and future retirees
          over twenty years.

          Since 1981, the Company has been funding amounts to
          irrevocable trusts as allowed for income tax purposes. 
          These funded amounts have been expensed and recovered
          through customer rates.  The investments in the trust
          covering administrative employees are subject to federal
          income taxes at a 39.6% tax rate, while the non-
          administrative trust is tax-exempt.

          The tables below set forth the plans' accrued post-
          retirement benefit obligation ("APBO") as of December 31,
          1994 and 1993 and the expense provision for the years then
          ended.

          The assumed expected long-term return on investments and the
          discount rate used to measure the APBO under SFAS No. 106
          are consistent with rates used to calculate the pension
          plans  funded status and expense under SFAS No. 87.  The
          assumed health care cost trend rates for 1995 are 11.5% for
          medical and 8.5% for dental, decreasing to 7.0% and 5.0%,
          respectively, by the year 2006.  Increasing each of the
          medical and dental cost trend rates by 1% in each year would
          increase the total APBO as of December 31, 1994 by

                                    -46-
<PAGE>
          $24.7 million and the total net periodic post-retirement
          benefit cost for the year then ended by $4.1 million.

          During 1992, the cost of post-retirement health care
          benefits was $2.7 million.  As of December 31, 1994, the
          Company had approximately 1,000 retirees eligible to receive
          health care benefits.

          Concurrent with a rate order which was effective January 1,
          1994, the Company adopted SFAS No. 112, Employers' 
          Accounting for Post-Employment Benefits, which establishes
          accounting and reporting standards for post-employment
          benefits other than those covered by SFAS Nos. 87 and 106. 
          In connection therewith, the Company expensed in 1994 the
          transition obligation of $1.8 million and recovered this
          cost through its customer rates.

          The Company has a leveraged Employee Stock Ownership Plan
          and Trust ("ESOP") that held 2,240,500 shares of WPSR common
          stock (market value of approximately $59.9 million) at
          December 31, 1994.  At that date, the ESOP also had loans
          guaranteed by the Company and secured by the common stock. 
          At December 31, 1994, these loans had recorded values of
          $1.8 million (bearing an interest rate of 73.5% of prime
          rate) and $18.2 million (bearing an interest rate of 9.33%). 
          The estimated market value of these loans at December 31,
          1994 totaled $20.5 million.

          Principal and interest on the loans are to be paid through
          the Company contributions and through dividends on WPSR
          common stock held by the ESOP.  Shares in the ESOP are
          allocated to participants as the loans are repaid.  Tax
          benefits from dividends paid to the ESOP are recognized as a
          reduction in the Company's cost of providing service to
          customers.  The PSCW has allowed the Company to include in
          cost of service an additional employer contribution to the
          plan.  The net effect of the tax benefits and of the
          employee contribution is an approximately equal sharing of
          benefits of the program between customers and employees.

     (n)  INCOME TAXES - Effective January 1, 1993, the Company
          adopted the liability method of accounting for income taxes
          as prescribed by SFAS No. 109, Accounting for Income Taxes. 
          Under the liability method, deferred income tax liabilities
          are established based upon enacted tax laws and rates
          applicable to the periods in which the taxes become payable. 
          The adoption of this accounting standard had an
          insignificant impact on the Company s net income.  The
          excess deferred income taxes, resulting from taxes provided
          at rates greater than current rates, and the previously
          unrecorded deferred income taxes, have been recorded as a
          net regulatory liability to be refunded to customers in
          future years.  Such net regulatory liability totaled
          $38.6 million as of December 31, 1994.

                                    -47-
<PAGE>
          The effective income tax rates are computed by dividing
          total income tax expense, including investment credit
          restored, by the sum of such expense and net income. 
          Previously deferred investment tax credits are being
          restored over the life of the related utility plant.  The
          components of income tax expense are set forth in the tables
          below.

(2)  COMMERCIAL PAPER AND LINES OF CREDIT  

     To support outstanding commercial paper, the Company maintains
     unused bank lines of credit.  Some of these lines may be
     withdrawn at the discretion of the lenders.  While some cash
     balances represent compensating balances for credit lines and
     bank services, there are no legal restrictions as to withdrawal
     of these funds.  The majority of the lines of credit require a
     fee based on the unused balance.

     The following information relates to short-term borrowings and
     lines of credit for the years indicated:

     Included in the above lines of credit are agreements with
     commercial banks that permit the Company to borrow up to
     $16 million at any time provided there is compliance with certain
     financial covenants.  These agreements extend for thirteen months
     or more.  As of December 31, 1994, no borrowings were outstanding
     under these agreements.


(3)  JOINTLY-OWNED FACILITIES

     Information regarding the Company's share of major jointly-owned
     electric generating facilities in service at December 31, 1994 is

     The Company's share of direct expenses for these plants is
     included in the corresponding operating expenses in the
     consolidated statements of income, and the Company has supplied
     its own financing for all jointly-owned projects.  


(4)  LONG-TERM DEBT

     Sinking fund requirements on first mortgage bonds may be
     satisfied by the deposit of cash or reacquired bonds with the

                                    -49-
<PAGE>
     trustee and, for certain series, by the application of net
     expenditures for bondable property in an amount equal to 166-2/3%
     of the annual requirements.

     All series requiring the deposit of cash or reacquired bonds for
     sinking fund purposes have been satisfied to maturity.  For those
     series requiring unpledged property to satisfy sinking fund
     requirements, the Company has adequate unpledged property to
     satisfy the requirement for at least ten years.  

     In 1998, $50 million of 5-1/4% bonds will mature.

     As of December 31, 1994, the market value of the Company's first
     mortgage bonds was $273.0 million.  These bonds have a recorded
     value of $291.1 million.  Historically, gains or losses resulting
     from the settlement on long-term debt obligations have been
     deferred as required by regulators.


(5)  COMMON EQUITY  

     At December 31, 1994, the Company had $279.8 million of retained
     earnings available for dividends; however, the Company is
     restricted by a PSCW order to paying normal dividends of no more
     than 109% of the previous year's common stock dividend without
     prior notice to the PSCW.  Also, Wisconsin law prohibits the
     Company from making loans to WPSR and its subsidiaries and from
     guaranteeing their obligations.  The Company's equity
     capitalization ratio at December 31, 1994 was 54% which is the
     same rate approved by the PSCW for ratemaking purposes.


(6)  COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES  

     COAL CONTRACTS

     To ensure a reliable, low-cost supply of coal, the Company
     entered into certain long-term contracts that have take-or-pay
     obligations totaling $323.7 million from 1995 through 2016. The
     obligations are subject to force majeure provisions which provide
     the Company other options if the specified coal does not meet
     emission limits which may be mandated in future legislation.  In
     the opinion of management, any amounts paid under the take-or-pay
     obligations described above would be legitimate costs of service
     subject to recovery in customer rates.

     GAS COSTS

     The Company also has natural gas supply and transportation
     contracts that require total demand payments of $412.3 million
     through October 2003.  Management believes that these costs will
     be recoverable in future customer rates.

                                    -50-
<PAGE>
     ANR Pipeline Company ("ANR"), the Company's primary pipeline
     supplier, filed with the FERC for approval to recover a portion
     of certain take-or-pay costs it incurred from renegotiating its
     long-term gas contracts.  As a result of the filing, ANR was
     allowed to recover a portion of these costs from its customers. 
     The Company began paying its share of these take-or-pay costs to
     ANR in 1989 and recovering these costs directly from customers
     through its purchased-gas-adjustment clause.  In March 1991, the
     FERC approved the settlement under which the Company will pay ANR
     monthly take-or-pay amounts.  Additional take-or-pay claims by
     ANR may be filed with FERC.  To date, the PSCW has granted the
     Company recovery of all take-or-pay costs.  

     In April 1992, the FERC issued Order No. 636 ("Order") which
     requires natural gas pipelines to restructure their sales and
     transportation services.  As a result of this Order, the Company
     is obligated to pay for a portion of ANR's transition costs
     incurred to comply with the Order.  At December 31, 1994, the
     Company has an accrued liability with an offsetting regulatory
     asset in the amount of $1.9 million for a portion of these
     transition costs.  Though there may be additional costs, which
     could be significant, the amount and timing of these costs are
     unknown at this time.  Management expects to recover these costs
     in future customer rates.

     The Company will be billed $3.3 million in 1995 for their
     allocation of ANR's above-market costs of gas purchases from the
     Dakota Gasification Plant.  The Company is protesting the
     legality of these costs which could total $49.0 million through
     2009.

     NUCLEAR LIABILITY

     The Price-Anderson Act provides for the payment of funds for
     public liability claims arising out of a nuclear incident.  In
     the event of a nuclear incident involving any of the nation's
     licensed reactors, the Company is subject to a proportional
     assessment which is approximately $32.7 million per incident, not
     to exceed $4.1 million per incident, per calendar year.  These
     amounts represent the Company's 41.2% ownership share in
     Kewaunee.

     CLEAN AIR REGULATIONS

     In 1990, the Federal Clean Air Act Amendments ("Act") were signed
     into law.  The Act requires the Company to meet new emission
     limits for sulfur dioxide and nitrogen oxide in 1995 (Phase I)
     and in the year 2000 (Phase II).  Since Wisconsin had already
     mandated reduced sulfur dioxide emissions by 1993, which were
     lower than the Federal levels mandated for 1995, the Company was
     already working on lowering emissions.  The Company has complied
     with both the Federal and Wisconsin sulfur dioxide laws primarily
     through fuel-switching.  The Company was in compliance with the

                                    -51-
<PAGE>
     Wisconsin sulfur dioxide limits and the Federal Phase II limits
     in 1994.  

     The final Federal regulations for nitrogen oxide are not known at
     this time; however, based on draft rules, the Company expects to
     make additional capital expenditures in the range of $15 million
     to $25 million between 1995 and 1999 for Wisconsin and Federal
     air quality compliance.  Management believes that all costs
     incurred to comply with these laws will be recoverable in future
     customer rates.

     MANUFACTURED GAS PLANT REMEDIATION

     The Company currently is investigating the need for environmental
     clean up of eight manufactured gas plant sites which it
     previously operated.  An environmental consultant has been
     engaged to develop cost estimates.  These estimates are based
     upon an investigation of two of the sites and assumes excavation
     of impacted soils, thermal treatment of soils, on-site
     groundwater extraction and treatment and post-clean up and
     monitoring for twenty-five years.  The consultant has not yet
     performed  detailed investigations of the remaining six sites
     and, therefore, comparable information on these sites is not
     available.  

     The Company used the estimates for these two sites as a basis for
     making projections on cleanup costs at the other sites because of
     certain similar characteristics at the other sites.  Thus, for
     all sites, cleanup costs reflecting anticipated inflation,
     current technology and no change in regulatory requirements are
     estimated to be in the range of $14.8 million to $29.3 million. 
     Management has accrued $26.9 million for future cleanup costs for
     all eight sites which will be spent over the next thirty-four
     years. However, as further investigations are performed on all
     sites, this estimate may change significantly.  

     The $26.9 million estimate has been recorded as a liability with
     an offsetting deferred charge (regulatory asset).  Based on a
     recent rate order, these costs (less any insurance recoveries)
     will be recoverable in future rates as expenditures are made.
     However, carrying costs are not recoverable.

     As additional site-specific studies are completed (three are
     anticipated in 1995), these estimates will be adjusted to reflect
     site-specific data. Other factors that can impact these estimates
     are the volume of contaminated soil, changes in remediation
     technology and regulatory requirements.  

     In June, the Wisconsin Supreme Court ("Court") issued a decision
     regarding recoveries from insurance companies for environmental
     remediation costs.  The Court held that insurance coverage was
     not available for environmental cleanup costs to the extent the
     clean up is done to prevent or mitigate future injury.  In
     addition, the Court held that a notification letter from a

                                    -52-
<PAGE>
     government agency about an environmental situation did not
     constitute a suit which triggers the insurers' duty to defend.
     The Company is exploring alternative approaches to pursuing
     claims against its carriers in light of the decision.

     The Company has made minor payments for the investigation and
     potential clean up of certain other waste disposal sites. 
     Management believes the Company has been a minor contributor to
     the total contamination at these sites and, accordingly, does not
     believe its share of cleanup costs to be material.

     LONG-TERM POWER SUPPLY 

     The Company has signed a contract to build a 122-megawatt
     cogeneration facility with Rhinelander Paper Company and has
     filed an application for a Certificate of Public Convenience and
     Necessity with the PSCW requesting approval for the project. 
     Estimated cost for the project is $169 million. 

     Management estimates 1995 utility plant construction expenditures
     to be approximately $84.2 million.  DSM expenditures are
     estimated to be $25.8 million, of which approximately
     $15.0 million will be deferred and amortized over the next ten
     years consistent with rate recovery.

Because of various factors which affect the utility business, the quarterly
results of operations are not necessarily
comparable.

<FN>
(1)  In the quarter ended December 1993, the Company recorded an adjustment as
a result of its annual coal inventory
     observation.  

     This adjustment increased net income and earnings per average share of
common stock by $1.2 million and $.05,
     respectively, for 1993.

                   ----------------------------------------                   

                                       

To Wisconsin Public Service Corporation:

We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets and
consolidated statements of capitalization of Wisconsin Public Service
Corporation (a Wisconsin corporation) and subsidiary as of
December 31, 1994 and 1993, and the related consolidated statements of
income, retained earnings and cash flows for each of the three years
in the period ended December 31, 1994.  These financial statements are
the responsibility of the Company's management.  Our responsibility is
to express an opinion on these financial statements based on our
audits.

We conducted our audits in accordance with generally accepted auditing
standards.  Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit
to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements
are free of material misstatement.  An audit includes examining, on a
test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the
financial statements.  An audit also includes assessing the accounting
principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well
as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation.  We
believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.

In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to
above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position
of Wisconsin Public Service Corporation and subsidiary as of
December 31, 1994 and 1993, and the results of their operations and
their cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended
December 31, 1994 in conformity with generally accepted accounting
principles.

As discussed in notes (1)(m) and (1)(n) to the financial statements,
effective January 1, 1993, Wisconsin Public Service Corporation
changed its method of accounting for post-retirement benefits other
than pensions and income taxes.
