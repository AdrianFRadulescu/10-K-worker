ITEM 1.  BUSINESS

                                   BACKGROUND

          Wilshire Oil Company of Texas (the "Company", "Registrant" or
"Wilshire") was incorporated under the laws of the State of Delaware on December
7, 1951. The Company's principal executive offices are located at 921 Bergen
Avenue, Jersey City, New Jersey 07306, (201) 420-2796.

          The Company is engaged in the exploration and development of oil and
gas, both in its own name and through several wholly-owned subsidiaries in the
United States and Canada. The Company's real estate division owns investment
real estate properties in Arizona, Texas, Florida and New Jersey. The Company
also holds investments in certain marketable securities.

     
               FINANCIAL INFORMATION RELATING TO INDUSTRY SEGMENTS
     
          For financial segment information please see Note 8, "Segment
Information" of the "Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements", presented
elsewhere herein. The Company has no export sales or sales to affiliated
customers.

                             DESCRIPTION OF BUSINESS

OIL AND GAS OPERATIONS

          For a glossary of oil and gas terms, see "Properties - Oil and Gas
Properties - Glossary."

          The Company conducts its oil and gas operations on the North American
continent. Oil and gas operations in the United States are located in Arkansas,
California, Kansas, Nebraska, New Mexico, Ohio, Oklahoma, Pennsylvania, Texas
and Wyoming. In Canada, the Company conducts oil and gas operations in the
Provinces of Alberta, British Columbia and Saskatchewan. 
                                                             
          As of March 15, 1996, 16 people are employed by the Company. Twelve
employees are directly engaged in the search for new oil and gas properties. In
addition, the Company also has consultants. 

          Prospects for lease acquisitions are developed by staff geologists or
acquired from various co-venturers and/or consultants.


                                        1


<PAGE>

          Once a property is acquired, the Company subcontracts for surveying
and drilling operations.  Many of the Company's present producing oil and gas
properties are operated by independent contractors or under operating agreements
with other companies pursuant to which the Company pays a proportionate share of
operating expenses based upon its interests.  The Company also acts as operator
of various properties, charging joint venture partners for their proportionate
share of expenses.

          The Company does not engage in the refining of crude oil or the
distribution of petroleum products.  Crude oil and natural gas productions are
sold to oil refineries and natural gas pipeline companies.

          The Company participated in the drilling of 11 wells (1.3 net) in 1995
compared to 15 (2.7 net) in 1994.

          The United States' program in 1995 consisted of the drilling of 8
development wells (1.0 net). All of these  wells were successfully completed as
oil wells for a success ratio of 100%.

          Two (.6 net) out of  the eight wells drilled were in Wyoming, the
other six  (.4 net)  in Oklahoma.  The two successful wells in Wyoming were the
Messenger #1-3H and the Elk Mountain 41-4 #1H.  Both of these wells were oil
wells and used horizontal drilling, which enables the driller to laterally
intersect several vertical fractures, as distinguished from conventional
drilling methods which limit the number of vertical fractures intersected.  The
six wells drilled in Oklahoma were conventional in nature.  Of the six Oklahoma
wells, five were gas wells and one oil.  

          The Canadian drilling program in 1995 consisted of the drilling of 3
wells (0.3 net), 2 development and 1 exploration. The development wells (.02
net) were successfully completed as oil wells. 
     
          Overall, drilling activities added 257,000 barrels of oil and 118,000
MCF gas to proved reserves in 1995.

          The Company's crude oil and condensate production is sold at posted
field prices, primarily to major crude oil and condensate purchasers. For
average posted field prices, for both oil and gas, see "Properties - Oil and Gas
Properties - Production." The Company has one purchaser, Amoco Production
Company that purchased in excess of 10% of its 1995 consolidated oil and gas
revenues. Amoco purchased 10.5%. Amoco is located in the United States. 

          The loss of any one customer in the domestic hydrocarbon market is not
considered material. The Company is not dependent on any patent, trademark or
license.


          The Company's oil and gas business is subject to all of the operating
risks normally associated with the exploration for and production of oil and
gas.  In accordance with customary industry practices, the Company maintains
insurance coverage limiting financial loss resulting from certain of these
operating hazards.


                                        2

COMPETITION

          The oil and gas industry is intensely competitive and competes with
other industries in supplying the energy and fuel requirements of industrial,
commercial and individual customers.

          The principal method of competition in the production of oil and gas
is the successful location and acquisition of properties which produce
commercially profitable quantities of oil and gas.

          The Company competes with many other companies in the search for and
acquisition of oil and gas properties and leases for exploration and
development.  Many of these companies have substantially greater financial,
technical and other resources than the Company.  Competition among petroleum
companies for favorable oil and gas prospects can be expected to continue.  The
Company is not a significant factor in the oil and gas industry.

          The principal raw materials and resources necessary for the
exploration for, and the acquisition, development, production and sale of, crude
oil and natural gas are leasehold or freehold prospects under which oil and gas
reserves may be discovered, drilling rigs and related equipment to explore for
and develop such reserves, casing and other capital assets required for the
development and production of the reserves and knowledgeable personnel to
conduct all phases of oil and gas operations.  The Company must compete for such
raw materials and resources with both major oil companies and independent
operators and also with other industries for certain personnel and materials. 
Although the Company believes its current inventories of raw materials and
resources are adequate to preclude any significant disruption of operations in
the immediate future, the continued availability of such materials and resources
to the Company cannot be assured.


SEASONALITY

          The oil business is generally not seasonal  in nature.  Gas demand and
prices paid for gas have become seasonal, showing a decrease during the summer
and fall.


                                        3

<PAGE>

ENVIRONMENTAL MATTERS

          The petroleum industry is subject to numerous federal, state and
provincial environmental statutes, regulations and other pollution controls in
both the United States and Canada.  In general, the Company is and will continue
to be subject to present and future environmental statutes and regulations.

          The Company's expenses relating to preserving the environment during
1995 were not significant in relation to operating costs and the Company expects
no material changes in 1996.  Environmental regulations have had no materially
adverse effect on the Company's petroleum operations to date, but no assurance
can be given that environmental regulations will not, in the future, result in a
curtailment of  production or otherwise have materially adverse effects on the
Company's operations or financial condition.

REGULATION - UNITED STATES OPERATIONS

          The Company's operations are affected from time to time, in varying
degrees, by political developments, laws and regulations.  In particular, oil
and gas production operations are affected by changes in taxes and other laws
relating to the petroleum industry and by constantly changing administrative
regulations.  The long-term effects of all the federal enactments and programs,
whether beneficial or detrimental to the future operations and income of the
Company, cannot be predicted at this time.

          Rates of production of oil and gas have for many years been subject to
conservation laws and regulations.  State regulatory agencies set allowable
rates of production and limit the number of days a month a well can produce. 
The petroleum industry has also been subject to tax laws dealing specifically
with it, such as the Crude Oil Windfall Profit Tax Act.  In addition, oil and
gas operations are subject to extensive regulation or termination by government
authorities on account of ecological and other considerations.  All of the
jurisdictions in which the Company operates have statutes and administrative
regulations governing the drilling and production of oil and gas.

REGULATION - CANADIAN OPERATIONS

          The Company's Canadian subsidiary, Wilshire Oil of Canada, Ltd.,
operates primarily in the Province of Alberta, with some activity in the
Province of British Columbia and Saskatchewan.

          The petroleum and natural gas industry operates under federal and
provincial legislation and regulations which govern land tenure, royalties,
production rates, environmental protection, exports and other matters.  Federal
legislation monitors the price of oil and gas in export trade and the quantities
of such products exportable from Canada.  Provincial legislation has been
enacted for the purpose of regulating operations in the Provinces.


                                        4

OIL PRICES

          Oil prices actually being paid by purchasers in the United States are
publicly announced throughout the country and vary depending on locality and
qualitative specifications of the crude oil.  All prices are subject to future
modification by appropriate agency action.  



JACOBS ENGINEERING INVESTMENT

          Wilshire made a significant investment in Jacobs Engineering Group,
Inc.  ("Jacobs") initially during 1986 by purchasing 278,300 shares of common
stock at an average price of $7.25 per share.  Subsequently, the Company
purchased additional shares, the stock split, stock dividends were received and
the Company sold certain shares.   The Company realized gains on sales of common
shares of Jacobs of $9,182,000 in 1995 compared to $5,457,000 in 1994.  On
December 31, 1995 Wilshire held 1,059,660 shares at an average cost of $8.26 per
share.

          Jacobs, headquartered in Pasadena, California, is listed on the New
York Stock Exchange.   It is a world-wide leader in engineering design,
construction management and operation of industrial facilities, plants and
governmental projects.

          Jacobs reported record results for its fiscal year ended September 30,
1995.  From 1994 to 1995, revenues increased from $1.2 billion to $1.7 billion,
net income increased from $19 million to $32 million, and net income per share
increased from $.75 to $1.27.

          The closing price of Jacobs' common stock on the New York Stock
Exchange on March 15, 1996 was 3.4  times more than Wilshire's average cost of
the shares it currently holds.  Wilshire's cost as of March 15, 1996 was
$8,756,000.  The aggregate market value of the Jacobs common stock held by
Wilshire on March 15, 1996 (based on the closing price on that date) was
$30,068,000, or $21,312,000 in excess of Wilshire's cost basis.

          The stock of Jacobs held by Wilshire continues to be important to
Wilshire as it broadens the Company's base and adds substantially to the value
of the Company's assets.

REAL ESTATE OPERATIONS

          The Company's real estate operations are conducted in the states of
Arizona, Texas, Florida and New Jersey. They are not seasonal in nature. 
    
          The Company's Arizona properties include two garden apartment
complexes, a midrise apartment building, an office building, and a
retail/medical use complex.  The garden apartment complexes consist of a 340
unit complex and a 378 unit complex.  The midrise apartment building is a 70
unit, four story building.  The office building is a 53,000 square foot multi-
tenant two story building.  The retail/medical use property consists of 65,000
square feet.

          The Texas property is a  228 unit apartment complex. 

          The Florida property consists of two office buildings having a
combined area of 28,000 square feet. 
    
          The Company's properties in New Jersey include  apartment properties
having  274 units as well as various commercial/retail properties.

          The Company utilizes property management companies to assist in the
management of  its properties.  Expenses incurred in operating the properties
include, among other things, administrative costs, utilities, repairs and
maintenance and property taxes.
   
          The Company will explore other real estate acquisitions as they arise.
The timing of any such acquisition will depend on, among other things, economic
conditions and the favorable evaluation of specific opportunities presented to
the Company.  Accordingly, while the Company anticipates that it will actively
explore real estate acquisition opportunities, no assurance can be given that
any such acquisition will occur.
    
          The real estate industry is intensely competitive in nature.  The
Company competes with many other real estate operators and is not a significant
factor in the market it operates in.

          The Company's real estate operations are subject to existing federal
and state laws regarding environmental quality and pollution control. 
Environmental regulations had no materially adverse effect on the Company's real
estate operations during 1995, but no assurance can be given that environmental
regulations will not, in the future, have a materially adverse effect on the
Company's operations.

gas equivalents are determined using the ratio of six Mcf of natural gas to one
Bbl of crude oil, condensate or natural gas liquids.

          DEVELOPED ACREAGE.  The number of acres which are allocated or
assignable to producing wells or wells capable of production.

          DEVELOPMENT WELL.  A well drilled as an additional well to the same
reservoir as other producing wells on a lease, or drilled on an offset Lease not
more than one location away from a well producing from the same reservoir.

          EXPLORATORY WELL.  A well drilled in search of a new undiscovered pool
of oil or gas, or to extend the known limits of a field under development.

          GROSS ACRES OR WELLS.  The total acres or wells, as the case may be,
in which an entity has an interest, either directly or through an affiliate.

          LEASE.  Full or partial interests in an oil and gas lease, oil and gas
mineral rights, fee rights or other rights, authorizing  the owner thereof to
drill for, reduce to possession and produce oil and gas upon payment of rentals,
bonuses and/or royalties.  Oil and gas leases are generally acquired from
private landowners and federal, provincial and state governments.

RESERVES

          The quantities of natural gas and crude oil Proved and Proved
Developed Reserves presented herein include only those amounts which the Company
reasonably expects to recover in the future from known oil and gas reservoirs
under existing economic and operating conditions.  Therefore, Proved and Proved
Developed Reserves are limited to those quantities which are recoverable
commercially at current prices and costs, under existing technology. 
Accordingly, any changes in the future oil and gas prices, operating and
development costs, regulations, technology and other factors could significantly
increase or decrease estimates of Proved and Proved Developed Reserves.

          The Company's net Proved and Proved Developed Reserves of oil and gas
and the present values thereof at December 31, 1993 and 1994 and 1995 were
estimated by the independent professional engineering consultants referred to on
page 28.  Such estimates were utilized in the preparation of the Company's
consolidated financial statements for the applicable fiscal years and for
reporting purposes.

          Set forth below are estimates of the Company's Proved and Proved
Developed Reserves and the present value of estimated future net revenues from
such reserves based upon the standardized measure of discounted future net cash
flows relating to proved oil and gas reserves in accordance with the provisions
of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 69, "Disclosures about Oil
and Gas Producing Activities" (SFAS No. 69).  The standardized measure of
discounted future net cash flows is determined by using estimated quantities of
Proved Reserves and the periods in which they are expected to be developed and
produced based on period-end economic conditions.  The estimated future
production is priced at period-end prices, except where fixed and determinable
price escalations are provided by contract.  The resulting estimated future cash
inflows are reduced further by estimated future costs to develop and produce
reserves based on period-end cost levels.  No deduction has been made for
depletion, depreciation or income taxes or for indirect costs, such as general
corporate overhead.  Present values were computed by discounting future net
revenues by 10 percent per annum.

          The determination of oil and gas reserves is a complex and
interpretive process which is subject to continued revisions as additional
information becomes available.  Reserve estimates prepared by different
engineers from the same data can vary widely.  Therefore, the reserve data
presented herein should not be construed as being exact.  Any reserve estimate,
especially when based upon volummetric calculations, depends in part on the
quality of available data, engineering and geologic interpretation and
judgement, and thus, represents only an informed professional judgement. 
Subsequent reservoir performance may justify upward or downward revision of the
estimate.

          No Proved or Proved Developed Reserve estimates for oil and gas were
filed with or included in reports to any other federal or foreign governmental
authority or agency since the beginning of fiscal 1995, other than with the
Securities and Exchange Commission.

</TABLE>


          Production as shown in the table, which is net after royalty interests
due others, is determined by multiplying the gross production volume of
properties in which the Company has an interest by the percentage of the
leasehold or other property interest owned by the Company.

          The relative energy content of oil and gas (six Mcf of gas equals one
barrel of oil) was used to obtain a conversion factor to convert natural gas
production into equivalent barrels of oils.

          There are no agreements with foreign governments.

          Unit cost is computed on equivalent barrels of oil equating gas to oil
based on BTU content.  This method is appropriate for the Registrant since
several properties produce both oil and gas and production costs are not
segregated.

          The components of production costs may vary substantially among wells
depending on the methods of recovery employed and other factors, but generally
include severance taxes, administrative overhead, maintenance and repair, labor
and utilities.

e-   The net loss in 1991 includes a pretax charge of $3,000,000 as additional
     depreciation, depletion and amortization to reflect the effect of
     substantial declines in the worldwide prices received for oil and gas,
     coupled with the increased capitalized costs during this period. These
     price declines also had a direct adverse impact on the Company's oil and
     gas revenues in 1991 as compared to prior years. In addition, the
     comparability of net income is affected by the Company's stock option
     plan.           

f-   Total assets at December 31, 1995, 1994 and 1993 reflect investments in
     equity securities stated at market value. See Note 1 to the consolidated
     financial statements regarding this change in accounting.

      The Company's oil and gas operating performance is influenced by several
factors.  The most significant are the prices received for the sale of oil and
gas and the sales volume.   For 1995, the average price of oil that the Company
received was $15.69 compared to $14.83 for 1994, a price increase  of  5.8%. 
Average gas prices received by the Company in 1995 were lower than 1994 average 
gas prices.   The average price of gas for 1995 was $1.23  compared to $1.59 for
1994.

          The following table reflects the average prices received by the
Company for oil and gas, the average production cost per BOE, and the amount of
the Company's oil and gas production for the fiscal years presented:

</TABLE>

    
          Sales prices received by the Company for oil and gas have fluctuated
significantly from period to period.  The fluctuations in oil prices during
these periods primarily reflected market uncertainty regarding the inability of
the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries ("OPEC") to control the
production of its member countries, as well as concerns related to global supply
and demand for crude oil.  Gas prices received by the Company fluctuate
generally with changes in the spot market price for gas.  It is impossible to
predict future  price movements with certainty.

RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 1995  ("1995")  COMPARED WITH YEAR ENDED 
DECEMBER 31, 1994 ("1994").
 
          Net income  for the year ended December 31 increased from $3,577,000
in 1994 to  $4,300,000 in 1995. 

          Oil and gas revenues were $5,672,000 in 1995 compared to $7,926,000 in
1994. This decrease was attributable to production declines from year to 
year. Much of this decrease in production is typical of the natural decline 
experienced in a "horizontal well" drilling program.
  
          Real estate revenues increased from $7,885,000 in 1994 to $8,600,000
in 1995, an increase of $715,000.  This increase was principally due to higher
rents and increased occupancy.

          Oil and gas production expense decreased in 1995. Oil and gas
production expense decreased from $2,846,000 in 1994 to $2,524,000 in 1995.   
Production expense decreased due to, among other things, lower production in
1995.  

          Depreciation, depletion and amortization of oil and gas assets
amounted to $2,401,000 in 1995 compared to $3,150,000 in 1994. This decrease is
principally  attributable to a lower depletable pool and lower oil and gas 
revenues in 1995. Real estate depreciation was $1,037,000 in 1995 compared to
$870,000  in 1994. 

          General and administrative expense was relatively stable, amounting to
$1,415,000 in 1995 compared to $1,386,000 in 1994.  

          The Company realized gains on sales of common shares of Jacobs
Engineering Group, Inc. ("Jacobs") of $9,182,000 in 1995 compared to $5,457,000
in 1994.  As of December 31, 1995, the Company held 1,059,660 shares of Jacobs.

          Interest expense increased from $3,638,000 in 1994 to $4,144,000 in
1995 due to higher interest rates in general in 1995.

          The provision for income taxes includes Federal and Canadian taxes. 
Differences between the effective tax rate and the statutory income tax rates
are due to foreign resource tax credits in Canada, additional provision to 
cover the settlement of a tax examination, and the dividend exclusion in
the United States.

YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 1994 ("1994") COMPARED WITH YEAR ENDED 
DECEMBER 31, 1993 ("1993").
 
          Net income was $3,577,000 in 1994 as compared with $4,573,000 in 
1993. The 1994 operations included the revenues and expenses of real estate 
properties acquired on March 31, 1994 and gains on the sales of marketable 
securities. Gains on sales of marketable securities were $853,000 less in 1994 
than in 1993. 

          Oil and gas revenues were $7,926,000 in 1994 compared to $8,055,000 in
1993. Despite a substantial increase (17.9%) in oil production from the
successful horizontal drilling program during 1994, revenues decreased slightly
due to a drop in the price of crude oil from $15.87 in 1993 to $14.83 in 1994.
Consolidated revenues in 1993 also included a non-recurring gas settlement of
$450,000. 
  
          Real estate revenues increased from $6,526,000 in 1993 to $7,885,000
in 1994, an increase of $1,359,000. This increase was principally due to the
acquisition of additional investment properties in March 1994 as well as
generally higher rents and increased occupancy. 

          Oil and gas production expense was comparable in 1994 and 1993. Oil
and gas production expense was $2,846,000 in 1994 compared with $2,829,000 in
1993. Average cost per BOE decreased by 2% in 1994.

          Depreciation, depletion and amortization of oil and gas assets
amounted to $3,150,000 in 1994 compared to $3,936,000 in 1993. This decrease is
principally attributable to an increase in the estimated value of the Company's
oil and gas reserves. Real estate depreciation was $870,000 in 1994 compared to
$653,000 in 1993. This increase is principally attributable to the newly
acquired properties discussed above.

          General and administrative expense was $1,386,000 in 1994 compared to
$1,097,000 in 1993. The increase is principally attributable to increased
charges in 1994 related to the Company's non-qualified stock option plan.

          The Company realized gains on sales of common shares of Jacobs
Engineering Group, Inc. ("Jacobs") of $5,457,000 in 1994 compared to $6,256,000
in 1993. The Company sold less shares of Jacobs in 1994 than in 1993. As of
December 31, 1994, the Company held 1,412,960 shares of Jacobs.

          Interest expense increased from $2,776,000 in 1993 to $3,638,000 in
1994 due to the addition of $8,704,000 of new financing related to the
acquisition of real estate properties in March 1994 as well as substantially
higher interest rates in general in 1994.

          The provision for income taxes includes Federal and Canadian taxes.
Differences between the effective tax rate and the statutory income tax rates
are due to foreign resource tax credits in Canada and the dividend exclusion in
the United States.

EFFECTS OF INFLATION

          The effects of inflation on the Company's financial condition are not
considered to be material by management.

ACCOUNTING FOR INCOME TAXES

          Statement of Finanancial Accounting Standard No. 109- "Accounting for
Income Taxes" became effective for the Company beginning in the first quarter of
1993. SFAS 109 requires, among other things, an asset and liability approach to
accounting for income taxes. SFAS 109 did not have a material impact on its
consolidated financial statements.

ACCOUNTING FOR CERTAIN INVESTMENTS IN DEBT AND EQUITY SECURITIES

          On December 31, 1993 the Company adopted Statement of Financial
Accounting Standards No. 115 "Accounting for Certain Investments in Debt and
Equity Securities" (SFAS 115). The investments of the Company are principally
equity securities, held for indefinite periods of time. These securities are
carried at fair value and the difference between cost and fair value is
charged/credited directly to shareholders' equity net of income taxes. As of
December 31, 1995, the net unrealized gain on marketable securities was
$17,174,000. This amount, net of related deferred income taxes of $7,728,000, is
included as a credit to shareholders' equity in the Company's 1995 consolidated
financial statements. 

LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES

          At December 31, 1995 the Company had approximately $13.3 million in
marketable securities at cost, with a market value of approximately $30.5
million. The current ratio at December 31, 1995 was 3.4 to 1 on a market basis,
which management considers adequate for the Company's current business. The
Company's working capital was approximately $24 million at December 31, 1995.

          The Company anticipates that cash provided by operating activities and
investing activities will be sufficient to meet its capital requirements to
acquire oil and gas properties and to drill and evaluate these and other oil and
gas properties presently held by the Company.  The level of oil and gas capital
expenditures will vary in future periods depending on market conditions,
including the price of oil and the demand for natural gas, and other related
factors.  As the Company has no material long-term commitments with respect to
its oil and gas capital expenditure plans, the Company has a significant degree
of flexibility to adjust the level of its expenditures as circumstances warrant.
  
          The Company plans to actively continue its exploration and production
activities as well as search for the acquisition of oil and gas producing
properties and of companies with desirable oil and gas producing properties.
There can be no assurance that the Company will in fact locate any such
acquisitions.


                                       23

<PAGE>

          Net cash provided by operating activities was $745,000, $4,446,000,
and $2,489,000 in 1995, 1994 and 1993, respectively. The variations in the three
years principally relate to changes in accounts receivable and accounts payable
and accrued liabilities. 

          Net cash provided by (used in) investing activities was $4,159,000,
$(12,266,000) and $(4,165,000) in 1995, 1994 and 1993, respectively. The
variations principally relate to purchases of real estate properties and
transactions in securities. Purchases of real estate properties amounted to
$10.2 million in 1994 and $3.8 million in 1993. Proceeds from sales of
marketable securities amounted to $10,501,000 in 1995, $6,710,000 in 1994 and
$6,730,000 in 1993. The Company acquired $3,000,000 of preferred stock of The
Trust Company of New Jersey in 1994. Additionally, purchases of marketable 
securities amounted to $3,130,000 in 1995, $5,204,000 in 1994, and $2,170,000
in 1993. 

          Net cash provided by (used in) financing activities was ($4,215,000),
$7,167,000 and $233,000 in 1995, 1994 and 1993, respectively. The variations
principally relate to the issuance and renegotiation of long-term debt. In 1994
and 1993 the Company acquired real estate properties, which were financed with
long-term mortgage loans. Long-term mortgage loans incurred in connection with
these acquisitions amounted to approximately $8,704,000 in 1994 and $3,209,000
in 1993.

          In 1994, the Company renegotiated all of its secured bank loans (other
than mortgage notes). Among other things, more favorable principal amortization
was obtained and the maturity dates of these loans were extended.

          The Company believes it has adequate capital resources to fund
operations for the foreseeable future.

FINANCIAL ACCOUNTING STANDARDS BOARD STATEMENT NO. 69 DISCLOSURES

          The following disclosures are those required to be made by publicly
traded enterprises under Financial Accounting Standards Board Statement No. 69,
Disclosures About Oil and Gas Producing Activities.

          The SEC defines proved oil and gas reserves as those estimated
quantities of crude oil, natural gas and natural gas liquids which geological
and engineering data demonstrate with reasonable certainty to be recoverable in
future years from known reservoirs under existing economic and operating
conditions. Proved developed oil and gas reserves are those that can be
recovered through existing wells with existing equipment and operating methods.

          Estimated future cash inflows are computed by applying year-end prices
of oil and gas to year-end quantities of proved reserves. Future price changes
are considered only to the extent provided by contractual arrangements.
Estimated future development and production costs are determined by estimating
the expenditures to be incurred in developing and producing the proved oil and
gas reserves at the end of the year, based on year-end costs and assuming
continuation of existing economic conditions. Estimated future income tax
expenses are calculated by applying year-end statutory tax rates (adjusted for
permanent differences and tax credits) to estimated future pretax net cash flows
related to proved oil and gas reserves, less the tax basis of the properties
involved.

          These estimates are furnished and calculated in accordance with
requirements of the Financial Accounting Standards Board and the SEC. Due to
unpredictable variances in expenses and capital forecasts, crude oil and natural
gas price changes and the fact that the basis for such estimates vary
significantly, management believes the usefulness of these projections is
limited. Estimates of future net cash flows do not represent management's
assessment of future profitability or future cash flow to the Company.
Management's investment and operating decisions are based upon reserve estimates
that include proved reserves prescribed by the SEC as well as probable reserves,
and upon different price and cost assumptions from those used here. It should be
recognized that 


                                       27

applying current costs and prices at a 10 percent standard discount rate allows
for comparability but does not convey absolute value. The discounted amounts
arrived at are only one measure of financial quantification of proved reserves.

          There were no oil and gas estimates filed with or included in reports
to any other federal or foreign governmental authority or agency within the last
twelve months.

          Reserves in the United States were estimated by Ramsey Engineering
Inc. and the Company. Reserves in Canada were estimated by Citidal Engineering,
Ltd.

          "Total Costs Both Capitalized and Expensed, Incurred in Oil and Gas
Producing Activities" (including capitalized interest), "Cost Incurred in
Property Acquisition, Exploration and Development Activities" and "Results of
Operations from Oil and Gas Producing Activities" during the three years ended
December 31, 1995, 1994 and 1993 are included in Note 9 of the Notes to
Consolidated Financial Statements, presented elsewhere herein.

          The standardized measure of discounted estimated future net cash flows
and changes therein related to proved oil and gas reserves is as follows:

                   REPORT OF INDEPENDENT PUBLIC ACCOUNTANTS




To the Shareholders and
  Board of Directors of

        Wilshire Oil Company of Texas:

We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Wilshire Oil 
Company of Texas (a Delaware corporation) and subsidiaries as of December 31, 
1995 and 1994, and the related consolidated statements of operations, 
shareholders' equity and cash flows for each of the three years in the period 
ended December 31, 1995.  These financial statements are the responsibility 
of the Company's management.  Our responsibility is to express an opinion on 
these financial statements based on our audits.  

We conducted our audits in accordance with generally accepted auditing 
standards.  Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to 
obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free 
of material misstatement.  An audit includes examining, on a test basis, 
evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements.  
An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and 
significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall 
financial statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a 
reasonable basis for our opinion.  

In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present fairly, in 
all material respects, the financial position of Wilshire Oil Company of 
Texas and subsidiaries as of December 31, 1995 and 1994, and the results of 
their operations and their cash flows for each of the three years in the 
period ended December 31, 1995, in conformity with generally accepted 
accounting principles.

                  WILSHIRE OIL COMPANY OF TEXAS AND SUBSIDIARIES

                    NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS


(1) DESCRIPTION OF BUSINESS:

   Wilshire Oil Company of Texas ("the Company") is a diversified corporation
   engaged in oil and gas exploration and production and real estate
   operations.  The Company's oil and gas operations are conducted both in its
   own name and through several wholly-owned subsidiaries in the United States
   and Canada.  Oil and gas operations in the United States are located in
   Arkansas, California, Kansas, Nebraska, New Mexico, Ohio, Oklahoma,
   Pennsylvania, Texas and Wyoming.  In Canada, the Company conducts oil and
   gas operations in the Provinces of Alberta, British Columbia and
   Saskatchewan.  Crude oil and natural gas productions are sold to oil
   refineries and natural gas pipeline companies.  The Company's real estate
   holdings are located in the states of Arizona, Florida, New Jersey and
   Texas.  The Company also maintains investments in marketable securities.

(2) SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT
    ACCOUNTING POLICIES:

   Significant accounting policies followed by the Company and its subsidiaries
   are as follows-

     PRINCIPLES OF CONSOLIDATION-

      The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company
      and its wholly-owned subsidiaries.  Intercompany account balances and
      transactions among subsidiaries have been eliminated.  

     PERVASIVENESS OF ESTIMATES-

      The preparation of these financial statements in conformity with
      generally accepted accounting principals requires management to make
      estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and
      liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the
      date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and
      expenses during the reporting period.  Actual results may differ from
      these estimates. 

     CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS-

      The Company considers cash and cash equivalents to include deposits with
      banks having a maturity of three months or less. 

     MARKETABLE SECURITIES-

      The Company has adopted Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No.
      115, "Accounting for Certain Investments in Debt and Equity Securities"
      (SFAS 115).  As of December 31, 1995 and 1994, the marketable securities
      of the Company subject to the provisions of SFAS 115 consist primarily of
      equity securities.  These securities are held for indefinite periods of
      time and are thus carried at fair value in accordance with the standard. 
      Differences between an investment's cost and its fair value are charged
      (credited) directly to shareholders' equity, net of related deferred
      income taxes.  The cost of securities sold is determined on a specific
      identification basis.


                                      F-8


<PAGE>


      As of December 31, 1995 and 1994, the net unrealized holding gains were
      $17,174,000, and $18,487,000, respectively.  The net unrealized holding
      gains are included as a credit to shareholders' equity, net of deferred
      income taxes of $7,728,000 and $8,319,000 for 1995 and 1994,
      respectively.  

     PROPERTY AND EQUIPMENT-

      OIL AND GAS PROPERTIES-

       The Company follows the accounting policy, generally known in the oil
       industry as "full cost accounting," of capitalizing all costs, including
       interest costs, relating to the exploration for and development of its
       mineral reserves.  Under the Company's method, all costs incurred in the
       United States and Canada are accumulated in separate cost centers and
       are amortized using the gross revenue method based on total future
       estimated recoverable oil and gas reserves.  

       Capitalized costs are subject to a "ceiling" test that limits such costs
       to the aggregate of the estimated present value of the future net
       revenues of proved reserves and the lower of cost or fair value of
       unproved properties.  Management is of the opinion that, based on
       reserve reports of petroleum engineers and geologists, the fair value of
       the estimated recoverable oil and gas reserves exceeds the unamortized
       cost of oil and gas properties at December 31, 1995 and 1994. 

      REAL ESTATE AND OTHER PROPERTIES-

       Real estate properties and other property and equipment are stated at
       cost.  Depreciation is provided on the straight-line method using an
       estimated useful life of 30 to 35 years for real estate buildings and at
       various rates based upon the estimated useful lives of the other
       property and equipment.  

       As of December 31, 1995 and 1994, real estate properties consist of land
       with an aggregate cost of $7,928,000 and $7,928,000, buildings with an
       aggregate cost of $26,644,000 and $26,257,000 and furniture and fixtures
       with an aggregate cost of $1,963,000 and $1,338,000, respectively.  

      IMPAIRMENT OF PROPERTY AND EQUIPMENT-

       During 1995, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued Statement
       of Financial Accounting Standards No. 121, "Accounting for the
       Impairment of Long-Lived Assets."  The Company is required to adopt this
       standard for the year ending December 31, 1996.  The Company does not
       expect that the adoption of this standard will have a material adverse
       impact on its financial condition or results of operations. 


                                      F-9


<PAGE>


     DEFERRED INCOME TAXES-

      Certain transactions are recorded in the accounts in a period different
      from that in which these transactions are reported for income tax
      purposes.  These transactions, as well as other temporary differences
      between the basis in assets and liabilities for financial reporting and
      income tax purposes, result in deferred income taxes.  The principal
      transactions are those related to intangible drilling costs, exploration
      costs, expired leases, depreciation and nonproducing well costs (see Note
      6).  

     INCOME TAXES ON 
     UNREMITTED EARNINGS-

      Unremitted earnings of the Canadian subsidiary are intended to be
      permanently invested in Canada and are subject to foreign taxes
      substantially equivalent to United States Federal income taxes.  The
      unremitted earnings on which the Company has not been required to provide
      Federal income taxes amounted to approximately $14,628,000 at December
      31, 1995.  

     ACCOUNTING FOR STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION-

      The Financial Accounting Standards Board has issued Statement of
      Financial Accounting Standards No. 123, "Accounting for Stock-Based
      Compensation."  The Company is required to adopt this standard for the
      year ending December 31, 1996.  The adoption of this pronouncement will
      have no impact on the Company's financial condition or results of
      operations, however additional disclosures in the financial statements
      will be required. 

     FOREIGN CURRENCY TRANSLATION-

      The assets and liabilities of the Canadian subsidiary have been
      translated at current exchange rates, and related revenues and expenses
      have been translated at average annual exchange rates.  The aggregate
      effect of translation losses have been deferred as a separate component
      of shareholders' equity until the sale or liquidation of the underlying
      foreign investment.  

     NET INCOME PER COMMON SHARE-

      Net income per common share is based upon the weighted average number of
      shares outstanding during the year, after deduction of treasury stock, as
      well as the dilutive effect of stock options, if material. 

     RECLASSIFICATIONS-

      Certain reclassifications have been made to the 1994 and 1993 amounts in
      order to conform with the 1995 presentation.  


                                      F-10

   The Company owns 60,000 shares of The Trust Company of New Jersey's (The
   Trust Company) 9-3/4% preferred stock, which is stated at its original cost.
   Annual dividends of $585,000, $439,000 and $293,000 were received on the

   (a) The term loan payable bears interest at the prime lending rate (8.5% at
       December 31, 1995).  The loan agreement provides for repayment of
       principal in quarterly installments with the balance due in April, 1999.
       It also limits the amount of new debt without the bank's approval.  The
       loan is secured by substantially all of the domestic oil and gas
       producing properties as well as marketable securities with a market
       value of approximately $2,000,000 at December 31, 1995.  

   (b) The note bears interest at the prime lending rate.  The note is payable 
       in quarterly installments and matures in September, 1999 and is secured 
       by 30,000 shares of the preferred stock of The Trust Company and

       Trust Company totaling $27,782,000, payable in installments, bearing

(5) STOCK OPTIONS:

   Under various stock option plans adopted prior to 1995, stock options to
   purchase an aggregate of 374,491 shares of common stock were outstanding to
   officers, key consultants and employees at December 31, 1995.

   In June, 1995, the Company adopted two new stock-based compensation plans
   (1995 Stock Option and Incentive Plan "Incentive Plan"; and 1995 Non-
   employee Director Stock Option Plan "Director Plan") under which up to
   450,000 and 150,000 shares, respectively, are available for grant.  During
   1995, the Company granted 3,000 and 35,000 options to purchase future shares
   of common stock under the Incentive Plan and Director Plan, respectively.

   The number and terms of the options granted are determined by the Company's
   Stock Option Committee (the Committee) based on the fair market value of the
   Company's common stock on the date of grant.  The period during which an
   option may be exercised varies, but no option may be exercised after ten
   years from the date of grant.

   The following table summarizes stock option activity for 1995 and 1994-

   (a) At December 31, 1995, options outstanding include 236,667 options ($1.00
       to $4.44 per share) granted to certain employees or key consultants 
       whereby the initial option price as determined by the Committee is 
       subject to reduction (to a minimum of $1) by an amount equal to the 
       increase in market value from the date of grant.  Included in these 
       options are 212,841 options with attached stock appreciation rights, 
       pursuant to which the Company may elect to grant cash, stock or a 
       combination of cash and stock in lieu of the stock appreciation value. 
       Additional compensation attributable to these options is charged to 
       income or capitalized as exploration and development costs over 
       calculated periods of employment based on the duties performed by the 
       individuals awarded the options.  During 1995, 1994 and 1993, $143,000, 
       $49,000 and $124,000, respectively, was credited to operations, and
