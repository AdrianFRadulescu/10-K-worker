                                  FORM 10-K
                     For the Year Ended December 31, 1995


                                       
                                     PART I

ITEM 1.  BUSINESS.

         GENERAL.     The business of United States Lime & Minerals, Inc. (the
"Company" or the "Registrant"), which was incorporated in 1950, is the
production and sale of lime and limestone products.  The Company extracts
high-quality limestone from its quarries and then processes the limestone for
sale as aggregate, pulverized limestone, quicklime and hydrated lime.  These
operations are conducted through three wholly-owned subsidiaries of the Company:
Arkansas Lime Company, Corson Lime Company and Texas Lime Company. The Company
sold substantially all of the assets and business of its Virginia Lime Company
("VLC") subsidiary on July 15, 1992.  See "Disposition of Assets." References to
the Company herein include references to its subsidiaries.

         The Company's principal corporate office is located at 12221 Merit
Drive, Suite 500, Dallas, Texas 75251.

         BUSINESS AND PRODUCTS.    The Company extracts raw limestone and then
processes it for sale as aggregate, pulverized limestone, quicklime and hydrated
lime.  Aggregate is raw limestone which has been crushed to specified sizes.
Pulverized limestone is a dried product ground to granular and finer sizes.
Quicklime is produced when carbon dioxide is removed from limestone in a heat
process called calcination.  Hydrated lime is formed in a process called
hydration in which water is added to quicklime to produce a soft powder.

         Aggregate is used by the construction industry in concrete, asphalt and
road base.  Pulverized limestone is used primarily in the production of
construction materials such as asphalt paving and roofing shingles, as an
additive to agriculture feeds and as a soil enhancement.  Quicklime is used
primarily in the manufacturing of paper products, in sanitation and water
filtering systems and in metal processing.  Hydrated lime is used primarily in
municipal sanitation/water treatment, soil stabilization in highway and building
construction, the production of chemicals and the production of construction
materials such as stucco, plaster and mortar.

         PRODUCT SALES.   The Company sells its lime and limestone products
primarily in the states of Arkansas, Connecticut, Delaware, Kansas, Louisiana,
Mississippi, New Jersey, New Mexico, New York, Oklahoma, Pennsylvania, South
Carolina, Tennessee, Texas and Virginia.  Sales are made primarily by the
Company's 10 sales employees.  Sales personnel call on potential customers and
solicit orders which are generally made on a purchase-order basis.  The Company
also receives orders in response to bids that it prepares and submits to
potential customers.

         Principal customers for the Company's lime and limestone products are
highway, street and parking lot contractors, chemical producers, paper
manufacturers, roofing shingle manufacturers, glass manufacturers, municipal
sanitation/water treatment facilities, poultry and cattle feed producers,
governmental agencies, steel producers and electrical utility companies.


                                      -1-
<PAGE>   4
         During the year ended December 31, 1995, approximately 1,500 customers
accounted for the Company's sales of lime and limestone products.  No single
customer accounted for more than 10% of such sales.  The Company is not subject
to significant customer risks as its customers are considerably diversified as
to geographic location and industrial concentration.  However, given the nature
of the lime and limestone industry, the Company's profits are very sensitive to
changes in volume.

         Lime and limestone products are transported by rail and truck to
customers generally within a radius of 400 miles of each of the Company's
processing plants.  Sales of lime and limestone products are highest during the
months of March through November.

         Substantially all of the Company's sales are made within the United
States.

         ORDER BACKLOG.   The Company does not believe that backlog information
accurately reflects anticipated annual revenues or profitability from year to
year.

         SEASONALITY.     The Company's sales have historically reflected
seasonal trends, with the largest percentage of total annual revenues being
realized in the second and third quarters.  Low seasonal demand normally results
in reduced shipments and revenues in the first quarter.  Inclement weather
conditions have a negative impact on the demand for lime and limestone products.

         LIMESTONE RESERVES.   The company extracts limestone from three
open-pit quarries, all of which are Company-owned.  The Cleburne Quarry is
located 14 miles from Cleburne, Texas;  the Batesville Quarry is located near
Batesville, Arkansas;  and the Corson Quarry is located at Plymouth Meeting,
Pennsylvania. Access to each location is provided by paved roads.

         Texas Lime Company operates out of the Cleburne Quarry, which is
situated upon a tract of land containing approximately 459 acres.  In addition,
the Company owns 2,149 acres of land adjacent to the Cleburne tract containing
known high-quality limestone reserves in a bed averaging 28 feet in thickness,
with an overburden which ranges from 0 to 50 feet.  The Company also has mineral
interest in the 560 acres of land adjacent to the northwest boundary of the
Company's property.  This tract of land has 531 acres of proven limestone
reserves.  The calculated reserves are approximately 118,000,000 tons. Assuming
the present level of production at the Quarry is maintained, the Company
estimates the reserves are sufficient to sustain operations for approximately
100 years.

         Arkansas Lime Company operates out of the Batesville Quarry, which is
situated upon a tract of approximately 420 acres, 100 of which contain known
deposits of high-quality limestone reserves.  The average thickness of the
limestone bed in this deposit is approximately 60 feet, with an overburden
averaging 20 feet.  Reserves are calculated at approximately 20,000,000 tons.
Assuming the present level of production at the Quarry is maintained, the
Company estimates that reserves are sufficient to sustain operations in excess
of 40 years.  In addition, the Company owns approximately 353 acres with certain
reserves in three tracts of land, which are located adjacent to the Quarry on
its northern, western and southern boundaries.  It is probable that these
additional reserves would extend the life of the Quarry by approximately 25
years.

         Corson Lime Company operates out of the Corson Quarry, which is
situated at Plymouth Meeting, Pennsylvania upon a tract of land containing
approximately 315 acres, approximately 153 acres of which are underlain by
dolomitic limestone reserves.  Permitted reserves are calculated to be
approximately 81,000,000 tons at the Quarry.  The overburden averages
approximately 39 feet. The Company estimates that, assuming the present level of
production at the Quarry is maintained, the reserves are sufficient to sustain
operations for approximately 50 years.


                                      -2-

         MINING.  The Company extracts limestone by the open-pit method at its
three operating quarries.  The open-pit method, which consists of removing the
top layer of soil, trees and other substances and then extracting the exposed
limestone, is generally less expensive than underground mining.  The principal
disadvantage of the open-pit method is that operations are subject to inclement
weather.  To extract limestone, the Company utilizes standard mining equipment
which is Company-owned.  After extraction, limestone is crushed, screened and
ground in the case of aggregate and pulverized limestone, or further processed
in kilns and hydrators in the case of quicklime and hydrated lime, before
shipment.  The Company has no knowledge of any recent changes in the physical
quarrying conditions on any of its properties which have materially affected its
operations, and no such changes are anticipated.

         PLANTS AND FACILITIES.    The Company produces lime and limestone
products in the following plants:

         The Texas plant is located adjacent to the Cleburne Quarry on a tract
of land covering approximately 8.4 acres.  This plant is equipped with three
rotary kilns and has a daily-rated capacity of 1,200 tons of quicklime.  The
plant has pulverized limestone equipment which has a capacity to produce 550,000
tons of pulverized limestone annually, depending on the product mix. In addition
to this plant, the Company owns a plant which is located near Blum, Texas on a
tract of land covering approximately 40 acres.  It is equipped with two vertical
kilns and has a daily-rated capacity of 600 tons of quicklime. The Blum plant
was acquired in 1989 and has not been operated since that time; however, the
plant's storage and shipment facilities are currently being utilized.

         The Arkansas plant, situated on a tract of approximately 290 acres, is
located roughly two miles from the Batesville Quarry and is connected to the
Quarry by a Company-owned railway.  Utilizing six vertical kilns, this plant has
a daily-rated capacity of 345 tons of quicklime.  The plant has two grinding
systems which, depending on the product mix, has the capacity to produce 700,000
tons of pulverized limestone annually.

         The Pennsylvania plant is located adjacent to the Corson Quarry on a
tract of land covering approximately 147 acres.  It is equipped with a dual
crushing system and six vertical kilns and has a daily-rated capacity of 8,000
tons of aggregate and 300 tons of quicklime.

         The Company also maintains a distribution terminal in Mer Rouge,
Louisiana, to service customers in this region.

         The Company maintains lime hydrating equipment and limestone drying
equipment at all three plants. Storage facilities at each of its plants consist
primarily of cylindrical tanks, which are considered by the Company to be
adequate to protect its lime and limestone products and to provide an available
supply for customers' needs at the existing volume of shipments.  Equipment is
maintained at each plant to load trucks and at the Arkansas and Blum plants to
load railroad cars.

         The Company believes that its processing plants are currently being
properly maintained to meet its current needs and are adequately insured.  Much
of the equipment in the plants is aging and will require maintenance and repair
in the future.  See "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial
Condition and Results of Operations" regarding the Company's expected capital
expenditures for modernizing and re-equipping the plants.

         EMPLOYEES.  The Company employed, at December 31, 1995, 338 persons,
45 of whom are engaged in sales, administrative and management activities.  Of
the Company's 293 production employees, 235 are covered by collective
bargaining agreements.  These agreements expire as follows:

                      Pennsylvania facility in  July 1998
                        Texas facility in November 1996
                       Arkansas facility in December 1996


                                      -3-

         COMPETITION.     The lime and limestone industry has certain limiting
factors, including:  the availability of high-quality limestone (calcium
carbonate) reserves, the ability to secure mining and operating permits for a
facility, the cost of building processing plants to create the lime and
limestone products and the transportation costs associated with delivering the
products to customers.  There is not a large number of producers in the United
States as a whole, but producers tend to concentrate on known limestone
formations where competition takes place on a local basis.  The contraction of
the U.S. steel industry in the late 1970's and the early 1980's created an
excess of supply over demand, thus impacting prices and profit levels.  The
industry as a whole has expanded its customer base and, while still selling
heavily to the steel industry, also counts paper producers and road builders
among its major customers.  Recently, the environmental-related uses for lime
have been expanding, including use in flue gas desulfurization and the
treatment of both waste and potable water.

         ENVIRONMENTAL MATTERS.   The Company's operations are subject to
various federal, state and local environmental laws and regulations, including
the Clean Air Act, the Clean Water Act, the Resource Conservation and Recovery
Act, the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act
as well as the Toxic Substances Control Act.  Management does not believe that
any lack of compliance by the Company with applicable environmental laws will
have a material adverse effect on the Company.  In part in response to
requirements of environmental regulatory agencies, the Company incurred capital
expenditures of approximately $220,000 in 1995 on environmental compliance and
is planning to incur approximately $600,000 in 1996.  In the judgment of
management, forecastable expenditure requirements for the future are not of
such dimension as to have a materially adverse effect on the Company's
financial condition, results of operations, liquidity or competitive position.
The Company's recurring costs associated with managing and disposing of
potentially hazardous substances (such as fuels and lubricants used in
operations) and maintaining pollution control equipment amounted to $150,000 in
both 1995 and 1994.  The Company has not been named as a potentially
responsible party in any superfund cleanup site.

         As discussed in Notes 2 and 9 of Notes to Consolidated Financial
Statements, the Company entered into a settlement agreement with Rangaire
Company and Cameron Energy Company in December 1993.  Under the settlement, the
Company received a secured subordinated promissory note for $530,000 and cash
of $200,000.  In turn, the Company agreed to reimburse Cameron Energy Company,
up to a maximum of $200,000, for clean-up costs incurred with regard to a
parcel of land sold in 1989.  In this regard, the Company accrued $170,000 at
December 31, 1993.  In 1994, the Company reimbursed Cameron Energy $165,000 for
the clean-up of this parcel of land.

         DISPOSITION OF ASSETS.   Effective July 15, 1992, substantially all of
the assets and business of VLC, a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company, were

                                 1995  VS  1994

    Revenues increased from $36,865,000 in 1994 to $41,419,000 in 1995, an
increase of $4,554,000 or 12.4%.  This resulted from a 12.0% increase in sales
volume and a 0.4% increase in sales prices.  Volume was up at all plants in
1995.  Prices received for lime and limestone products at the Arkansas and
Texas plants slightly increased in 1995 compared to 1994.  Prices received for
lime and limestone products, including aggregates, at the Pennsylvania plant
were down slightly when compared to 1994.

    The Company's gross profit was $10,847,000 for 1995 compared to $7,629,000
for 1994, a 42.2% increase.  In addition to increased revenues, gross profit
was enhanced by improved efficiencies at the plants and lower amortization of
costs in excess of net assets acquired.

    Selling, general and administrative ("SG&A") expenses increased by $60,000
in 1995 compared to 1994.  SG&A expenses declined as a percent of revenues to
12.5% in 1995, from 13.9% in 1994.

    Interest expense decreased by $161,000 in 1995 over 1994.  This decrease
was due to lower debt outstanding.  The Company's Revolving Credit loan was
completely paid down in September 1995.

    The Company's net income for 1995 increased $2,344,000 or 122.3% from
$1,916,000 ($0.50 per share) in 1994, to $4,260,000 ($1.11 per share).

from a 10.8% increase in sales volume and a 3.1% increase in sales prices.  
Volume was up at all plants except at Texas, which was down compared to 1993.  
Prices received for lime and limestone products at all plants improved in 1994
compared to 1993 except the prices received for aggregates at the Pennsylvania
plant, which were down slightly when compared to 1993.  Volume of shipments
were up for aggregate at all plants in 1994.

          The Company's gross profit was $7,629,000 for 1994 compared to 
$6,073,000 for 1993, a 25.6% increase.  In addition to increased revenues, 
gross profit was enhanced by lower depreciation costs and lower amortization 
of costs in excess of net assets acquired.

          SG&A expenses decreased by $730,000 in 1994 compared to 1993.  This
decrease was primarily the result of both a $325,000 charge included in the
third quarter of 1993 for a payment due under an employment agreement and a
$392,000 charge in the first quarter of 1993 relating to resolution of the
Company's control and stockholder situation.  Excluding these charges, SG&A
expenses decreased by $13,000 in 1994 from 1993, declining as a percent of
revenues to 13.9% in 1994 from 15.9% in 1993.

          Interest expense increased by $84,000 in 1994 over 1993.  This 
increase was due to higher prevailing interest rates, which were partially 
offset by lower debt outstanding.

          The Company's net income for 1994 increased $2,357,000 from a loss of
$441,000 ($0.11 per share) in 1993, to $1,916,000 ($0.50 per share).  Included
in 1994 income was $425,000 ($372,000 net of taxes) due to the expiration of
certain potential post-closing obligations relating to the sale of VLC assets.
See Note 3 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for more information.

          DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS.  During 1993, income of $480,000 (net of 
taxes) was recorded, primarily attributable to a new subordinated secured 
promissory note for $530,000 received from the buyer of the discontinued 
manufacturing operations.  See Notes 2 and 9 of Notes to Consolidated 
Financial Statements.

    FINANCIAL CONDITION

    The Company's financial condition is reflected by the following key
financial measurements:

    In 1995, cash flow from operations was $7,943,000, an improvement of
$2,535,000 or 46.9% over 1994.  In 1995, this cash flow fully funded the
Company's capital expenditure program and reduced the Company's bank debt by
$1,844,000.


                                      -8-

          In October 1993, the Company entered into a financing agreement with a
commercial bank to replace its then-existing borrowings.  The agreement
provided for a 5-year $8,000,000 Term Loan with a monthly principal repayment
of $95,238, with the remaining principal due in September 1998.  The agreement
also provided for a 2-year $6,000,000 Revolving Credit.  Both are secured by
substantially all of the Company's assets.  The Term Loan originally carried an
interest rate of Prime plus 1%, and the Revolving Credit carried an interest
rate of Prime plus  3/4%, with a 1/2% fee on the unused Revolving Credit loan.
In February 1994, the Company fixed the interest rate on the Term Loan at 7.95%
per annum through February 1997.  In September 1995, the loan agreements were
amended to extend the Revolving Credit maturity date to November 1997.  For the
period of January 1 to September 29, 1995, the Term Loan, as amended, carried
an interest rate of Prime plus  1/2%, and the Revolving Credit carried an
interest rate of Prime plus 1/4%.  In addition, effective September 29, 1995,
the Term Loan carries an interest rate of Prime plus  1/4%, and the Revolving
Credit carries an interest rate of Prime.  The new Term Loan rate will go into
effect after the fixed term rate of 7.95% ends in February 1997.  The terms of
the financing agreements contain, among other provisions, requirements for
maintaining defined levels of working capital, net worth, financial ratios and
capital expenditure limitations.  The covenants restrict incurrence of debt,
liens and lease obligations, mergers, and consolidation or acquisition of
assets.

          Capital expenditures for 1995 totaled $4,851,000 compared to 
$2,682,000 in 1994.  The Company expects to spend $15-25 million over the next 
several years to modernize and re-equip plant facilities to improve efficiency 
and reduce costs, to effect environmental improvements and to ensure that 
capacity is in place to meet market demand.  Management believes that the 
necessary funds will be obtained through operations.  The Company is not 
contractually committed to any planned capital expenditures until actual 
orders are placed for equipment.

          In addition, the Company has completed the feasibility studies for a 
new kiln at the Arkansas plant and has decided to proceed with this project.  
The new kiln will complement the existing shaft kilns by allowing the Company to
expand its customer base.  The lime produced on the new kiln will meet the
specific chemical needs of both the existing customer base and customers the
Company currently is unable to serve.  The project is expected to cost
approximately $9-10 million.  The Company's progress on this project has been
slowed due to the state regulatory authorities requiring the Arkansas plant to
apply for and obtain a new plant wide permit.  This new permit replaced the
existing permit and now allows the Company to proceed with the permitting
process of the new kiln.  This permit is expected to be secured by the end of
1996.  The new kiln will be financed by internally generated funds and/or
alternative sources of financing.

ENVIRONMENTAL MATTERS

          The Company's operations are subject to various environmental laws and
regulations.  In part in response to requirements of environmental regulatory
agencies, the Company incurred capital expenditures of approximately $220,000
in 1995.  In the judgment of management, forecastable expenditure requirements
for the future are not of such dimension as to have a materially adverse effect
on the Company's financial condition, results of operations, liquidity or
competitive position.  See "Business--Environmental Matters."

    (c)  Use of Estimates

         The preparation of the financial statements in conformity with
         generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make
         estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the
         financial statements and accompanying notes.  Actual results could
         differ from those estimates.

    (d)  Statements of Cash Flows

         For purposes of reporting cash flows, the Company considers all
         certificates of deposit and highly-liquid debt instruments, such as
         U.S. Treasury Bills and Notes, with original maturities of three
         months or less to be cash equivalents.

         Supplemental cash flow information is presented below:

    (f)  Inventories

         Inventories are valued principally at the lower of cost or market
         determined using the average cost method.  Such costs include
         materials, labor and production overhead.

         A summary of inventories is as follows:

</TABLE>
    (g)  Property, Plant and Equipment

         Depreciation of property, plant and equipment is being provided for by
         the straight-line and declining-balance methods over estimated useful
         lives as follows:

<TABLE>
         <S>                                   <C>
         Buildings and building improvements   3-40 years
         Machinery and equipment               3-20 years
         Furniture and fixtures                3-10 years
         Automotive equipment                  3-8 years
</TABLE>

         Maintenance and repairs are charged to expense as incurred;  renewals
         and betterments are capitalized.  When units of property are retired
         or otherwise disposed of, their cost and related accumulated
         depreciation are removed from the accounts, and any resulting gain or
         loss is credited or charged to income.

    (h)  Other Assets

         Other assets consist of the following:

</TABLE>
         It is the Company's policy to make available for sale assets
         considered excess and no longer necessary for operations.  The
         carrying values of such assets are periodically reviewed and adjusted
         downward to market, when appropriate.

         Deferred stripping costs are amortized by the unit-of-production
         method based on the estimated recoverable reserves in the underlying
         area.

         Deferred financing costs are expensed over the shorter of the life of
         the debt or expected life of the loan using the interest method.

                (dollars in thousands, except per share amounts)



    (i)  Earnings Per Share of Common Stock

         Earnings per share of common stock are based on the weighted average
         number of shares outstanding during each year, which amounted to
         3,836,063 for the years ended December 31, 1995, 1994 and 1993.

    (j)  Environmental Expenditures

         Environmental expenditures that relate to current operations are
         expensed or capitalized as appropriate.  Expenditures that relate to
         an existing condition caused by past operations, and which do not
         contribute to current or future revenue generation, are expensed.
         Liabilities are recorded when environmental assessments and/or
         remedial efforts are probable, and the costs can be reasonably
         estimated.  Generally, the timing of these accruals will coincide with
         completion of a feasibility study or the Company's commitment to a
         formal plan of action.

(2) Discontinued Operations

    In June 1989, the Company sold the net assets of its manufacturing division
    to an unrelated joint venture (Purchaser).  As part of this sale, the
    Company received a $955 subordinated promissory note, the repayment of
    which was contingent upon the Purchaser having sufficient excess cash flow
    (as defined).  The Company was not receiving interest on the note,
    collection of the principal was considered to be doubtful and, accordingly,
    at that time the note was not recorded.  Subsequent to December 31, 1993,
    the Company recorded $200 in cash and a new subordinated note for $530 in
    substitution of the old note.  The new note was secured by all of the
    assets of the Purchaser, and carried an interest rate of 6% per annum.  The
    new note called for a monthly payment of $10 in interest and principal, and
    a final payment of $17 at the end of the 60th month.  The new note was
    recorded as income from discontinued operations in 1993.  The Purchaser
    paid the balance of the note in the fourth quarter of 1995.

(3) Gain on Sale of Virginia Lime Company Assets

    Effective July 15, 1992, substantially all of the assets and business of
    Virginia Lime Company (VLC) were sold to Eastern Ridge Lime Company, L.P.
    (Eastern Ridge), an unrelated company.  At the time of the sale, a $500
    reserve for post-closing adjustments was established.  Potential
    post-closing adjustments included possible additional expenditures for
    claims relating to a water supply system, workers' compensation matters,
    environmental matters, representations and warranties made to Eastern Ridge
    on various issues, employee benefit matters, legal fees and other
    professional charges.  Other than a $50 payment in 1993, in connection with
    the water supply system, Eastern Ridge asserted no claims for adjustment.
    The Company recorded a benefit of $425 in the second quarter of 1994, upon
    payment of certain legal and other expenses and expiration of the
    post-closing obligations.  The Company dissolved this subsidiary in 1995.

(4) Long-Term Debt

    In October 1993, the Company entered into a financing agreement with a
    commercial bank to replace its then-existing borrowings.  The agreement
    provided for a 5-year $8,000 Term Loan with a monthly principal repayment
    of $95, with the remaining principal due in September 1998.  The agreement
    also provided for a 2-year $6,000 Revolving Credit.  Both are secured by
    substantially all of the Company's assets.  The Term Loan originally
    carried an interest rate of Prime plus 1%, and the Revolving Credit carried
    an interest rate of Prime plus  3/4%, with a  1/2% fee on the unused
    Revolving Credit loan.  In February 1994, the Company fixed the interest
    rate on the Term Loan at 7.95% per annum through February 1997.  In
    September 1995, the loan agreements were amended to extend the Revolving
    Credit maturity date to November 1997.  For the period of January 1 to
    September 29, 1995, the Term Loan, as amended, carried an interest rate of
    Prime plus  1/2%, and the Revolving Credit carried an interest rate of
    Prime plus  1/4%.  In addition, effective September 29, 1995, the Term Loan
    carries an interest rate of Prime plus  1/4%, and the Revolving Credit
    carries an interest rate of Prime.  The new Term Loan rate will go into
    effect after the fixed term rate of 7.95% ends in February 1997.  The terms
    of the financing agreements contain, among other provisions, requirements
    for maintaining defined levels of working capital, net worth, financial
    ratios and capital expenditure limitations.  The covenants restrict
    incurrence of debt, liens and lease obligations, mergers, and consolidation
    or acquisition of assets.

    A summary of Long-term debt is as follows:

    At December 31, 1995, the Company had deferred tax liabilities of $653,
    deferred tax assets of $4,188 and a valuation allowance of $3,535.  The
    principal temporary difference related to the deferred tax liabilities is
    depreciation ($653).  The principal temporary differences related to the
    deferred tax assets were net operating loss (NOL) carryforwards ($1,047),
    general business credits ($510), certain financial statement accruals
    ($656) and alternative minimum tax credit carryforwards ($1,975).

    At December 31, 1994, the Company had deferred tax liabilities of $700,
    deferred tax assets of $4,508 and a valuation allowance of $3,808.  The
    principal temporary difference related to the deferred tax liability is
    depreciation ($700).  The principal temporary differences related to the
    deferred tax assets were NOL carryforwards ($1,983), general business
    credit ($756), certain financial statement accruals ($785) and alternative
    minimum tax credit carryforwards ($984).

    The Company has NOL carryforwards for tax purposes of $2,755 which will, if
    unused, expire in 2006 ($1,387), and 2008 ($1,368).  General business 
    credits of $510 are available to reduce the Company's federal income tax, 
    which expire starting 1997 through 2001.

    Deferred tax assets have been reduced by a valuation allowance as
    realization of some portion of these future tax benefits is dependent on
    generating sufficient taxable income.  Favorable resolution of these
    uncertainties would result in the reduction of the valuation allowance.

(6) Employee Retirement Plans

    The Company has a noncontributory defined benefit pension plan covering
    substantially all union employees of its wholly-owned subsidiary, Corson
    Lime Company.  Benefits for the Corson Lime Union Pension Plan (Corson
    Plan) are based on certain multiples of years of service.  The Company's
    funding policy is to contribute annually not less than the minimum required
    nor more than the maximum amount that can be deducted for Federal income
    tax purposes.  Contributions are intended to provide not only for benefits
    attributed to service to date but also for those expected to be earned in
    the future.  The Company funded pension costs of $127 for 1995, $96 for
    1994 and $96 for 1993.

    A summary of the funding status of the Corson Plan and the amounts
    recognized in the consolidated balance sheets are as follows:

                   NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
                (dollars in thousands, except per share amounts)


    In December 1986, the Company purchased 1,550,000 shares of its outstanding
    common stock for $10.50 per share.  Subsequent to that purchase, 200,000
    shares (300,000 shares after stock split) were sold to the Employee Stock
    Ownership Plan (ESOP) for $8.20 per share.  The Company obtained a note
    receivable from the ESOP for the purchase of the shares, which was
    classified as a reduction of stockholders' equity.  As of December 1994,
    the Company made all of the necessary contributions to the ESOP to repay
    all principal and interest due on the note.

    Through December 31, 1994, the Company contributed to the ESOP which covers
    substantially all full-time nonunion employees.  The ESOP is designed to
    invest primarily in the Company's common stock.  Contributions to the ESOP
    are made at the option of the Company, except for certain contributions
    which were required in order for the ESOP to repay the note receivable to
    the Company.  The Company did not make a contribution in 1995 and
    contributed $205 during each of the years 1994 and 1993.

(7) Selling, General and Administrative Expenses

    Selling, general and administrative (SG&A) expenses for 1993 include $391
    for payments related to the termination of employees.  In 1993, SG&A
    includes $215 of bank fees and professional charges incurred in connection
    with a proposed ESOP offer to buy the then-majority owner's shares in the
    Company and the related financing of the then-existing borrowings.  In May
    1993, the then-majority shareholder sold its shares, and, as a consequence,
    the proposed ESOP offer was abandoned.  SG&A expense also includes
    change-in-control payments of $177 made in May 1993.

(8) Stock Option Plan

    The Company has a stock option plan under which options for shares of
    common stock may be granted to key employees.  As of December 31, 1995, the
    Company has granted options to purchase a total of 355,000 shares at a
    range of $4.75 to $8.25 per share, the fair market value of the Company's
    common stock on the date of grant.  The options expire ten years from the
    date of grant and generally become exercisable after the expiration of one
    year from the grant date.  As of December 31, 1995, 25,000 shares are
    available for future grant.

(9) Commitments and Contingencies

    The Company leases some of the equipment used in its operations.
    Generally, the leases are for periods varying from one to five years and
    are renewable at the option of the Company.  Total rent expense was $232
    for 1995, $134 for 1994 and $213 for 1993.  As of December 31, 1995, future
    minimum payments under noncancelable operating leases are as follows:
    1996, $81;  1997, $77;  1998, $75;  and 1999, $36.

                   NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
                (dollars in thousands, except per share amounts)


    As of December 31, 1993, the Company reached agreements to settle two
    lawsuits styled Rangaire Company v. Rangaire Corporation and Cameron Energy
    Company v. Scottish Heritable, Inc.  In settlement of both lawsuits, the
    Company and the plaintiffs entered into mutual releases and agreement for
    dismissal with prejudice of all litigation for claims of any kind.  In
    exchange, the Company  (a) agreed to the substitution for an existing
    unsecured subordinated cash flow promissory note of $955 payable to it by
    Rangaire Company, bearing interest at 10% per annum, of a new secured
    subordinated promissory note for $530, bearing interest at 6% per annum,
    and  (b) received $200 in cash from Rangaire Company to be reimbursed to
    Cameron Energy up to $200 for clean-up costs incurred with regard to a
    parcel of land sold in 1989.  In 1993, the Company accrued $170 for
    potential claims by Cameron Energy.  The unsecured $955 cash flow
    promissory note previously was not recognized as income.  The new $530
    secured promissory note and the $200 cash payment were recorded in
    discontinued operations income in 1993.  In 1994, the Company reimbursed
    Cameron Energy $165,000 for the clean-up costs.  The balance remaining on
    the promissory note as of December 31, 1994 of $447 was completely repaid
    in the fourth quarter of 1995.

    The Company is party to other lawsuit and claims arising in the normal
    course of business, none of which, in the opinion of management, is
    expected to have a material adverse effect on the Company's financial
    condition, results of operation, liquidity or competitive position.

                                  INTRODUCTION


SECTION 1.01  BACKGROUND AND EFFECTIVE DATE.

The Company established the Rangaire Corporation Employee Stock Ownership Plan
(the "Plan") to enable Participants to share in the growth and prosperity of
the Company and to provide Participants with an opportunity to accumulate
capital for their future economic security effective as of August 1, 1975.  The
Plan has been amended from time to time, with a total of five amendments
through 1984, and was restated and amended to comply with the Employee
Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, as amended, and the Internal Revenue
Code of 1954, as amended, effective August 1, 1985.  The Company now desires to
restate and amend the Plan to reflect applicable changes in the law and to
change the name of the Plan to reflect the change in corporate name.Therefore,
the Company hereby amends and restates the Plan as the United States Lime &
Minerals, Inc. Employee Stock Ownership Plan, effective as of August 1, 1989
(except as otherwise provided herein).

The terms of this document set forth the controlling provisions of the Plan for
all persons who are eligible Employees on or after the Effective Date;
provided, however, that to the extent required under section 411(d)(6) of the
Code and related Regulations, the applicable provisions of the preceding Plan
documents are incorporated herein by reference.

Except as may be required by ERISA or the Code, the rights of any person whose
status as an Employee has terminated shall be determined pursuant to the Plan
as in effect on the date such employment terminated, unless a subsequently
adopted provision of the Plan is made specifically applicable to such person.


SECTION 1.02  PURPOSE.

The purpose of the Plan is to reward eligible Employees of the Employers for
their loyal and faithful service by providing them with an opportunity to
become stockholders of the Company.  The Plan is designed to invest primarily
in Company Stock.  The benefits provided by the Plan will be paid from the
Trust and will be in addition to the benefits eligible Employees are entitled
to receive under any other programs of the Employers and from the federal
Social Security Act.  The Plan and the Trust are established and shall be
maintained for the exclusive benefit of the eligible Employees of the Employers
and their Beneficiaries.  The Plan is intended to be qualified under section
401(a) of the Code and the Trust under the Plan is intended to be exempt from
tax under section 501(a) of the Code.  The Plan also is intended to be a stock
bonus plan qualified under section 401(a) of the Code and an ESOP.

The Plan is permitted to borrow funds to finance the acquisition of Company
Stock.  Any loans made to the Plan to finance the acquisition of Company Stock
must meet the requirements of an Acquisition Loan, as defined in Section 2.02
of the Plan.

SECTION 1.03  INTERPRETATION.

Throughout the Plan, certain words and phrases have meanings which are
specifically defined for purposes of the Plan.  These words and phrases can be
identified in that the first letter of the word or words in the phrase are
capitalized.  The definitions of these words and phrases are principally set
forth in Article II of the Plan.

Wherever appropriate, pronouns of any gender shall be deemed synonymous as
shall singular and plural pronouns.


                                   ARTICLE II
                                  DEFINITIONS

When used herein the following words and phrases shall have the meaning set
forth below:


SECTION 2.01  ACCOUNTS.

"Accounts" or "Account" means the interest of a Participant in the assets of
the Trust.

Each Participant's interest shall be segregated into the following account(s)
which shall reflect, in addition to contributions allocated thereto, earnings,
gains, losses, and expenses:

a.    Company Stock Account.  The separate account maintained for a Participant
      reflecting Company Stock allocated to the Participant and any earnings,
      gains, losses, and expenses thereon.

b.    Other Investments Account.  The separate account maintained for a
      Participant reflecting investments of the Plan other than Company Stock,
      attributable to Employer Contributions contributed to the Plan after the
      Effective Date which are not invested in Company Stock and any earnings,
      gains, losses, and expenses thereon.

c.    Special Stock Account.  The portion of the Company Stock Account
      maintained for Participants to whom shares of Company Stock attributable
      to specially designated Employer contributions were allocated.  The
      Special Stock Account was initially established and maintained to qualify
      the Plan as a tax credit employee stock ownership plan.  Contributions
      are no longer allocated to the Special Stock Account, and the balance of
      the Special Stock Account is 100% vested notwithstanding any provision of
      this Plan to the contrary.

The Committee may in its discretion, establish additional accounts and
subaccounts within each separate account.

the affected individuals in proportion to each such individual's Compensation
as determined prior to the application of this limitation.

Committee.

      Compensated Employee" means any Employee who performs service for the
      Employer during the determination year (defined herein) and who, during
      the look-back year (defined herein): (1) received Compensation from the
      Employer in excess of $75,000 (as adjusted pursuant to section 415(d) of
      the Code); (2) received Compensation from the Employer in excess of
      $50,000 (as adjusted pursuant to section 415(d) of the Code) and was a

      Code, for such year; or (3) was an officer of the Employer and received
      Compensation during such year that is greater than fifty percent (50%) of

      from the Employer during the determination year; and (2) Employees who
      are five percent owners at any time during the look-back year or
      determination year.

      If no officer has satisfied the Compensation requirement of (3) above
      during either a determination year or look-back year, the highest paid
      officer for such year shall be treated as a Highly Compensated Employee.

      For this purpose, the "determination year" shall be the calendar year
      ending within the Plan Year.  The "look-back year" shall be the

      former Employee or a Highly Compensated Employee who is one of the ten
      most Highly Compensated Employees ranked on the basis of Compensation
      paid by the Employer during such year, then the family member and the
      five-percent owner or top-ten Highly Compensated Employee shall be
      aggregated.  In such case, the family member and five  percent owner or
      top-ten Highly Compensated Employee shall be treated as a single Employee
      receiving Compensation and Plan contributions or benefits equal to the
      sum of such Compensation and contributions or benefits of the family
      member and five percent owner or top-ten Highly Compensated Employee.
      For purposes of this Section 2.24, family member includes the Spouse,
      lineal ascendants and descendants of the Employee or former Employee, and
      the Spouses of such lineal ascendants and descendants.

      The determination of who is a Highly Compensated Employee, including the
      determination of the number and identity of Employees in the top-paid
      group, the top one hundred (100) Employees, the number of Employees
      treated as officers and the Compensation that is considered, will be made
      in accordance with section 414(q) of the Code and the Regulations
      thereunder.

      received Compensation from the Employer in excess of $50,000 (as adjusted

      was an officer of the Employer and received Compensation during such year
      that is greater than fifty percent (50%) of the dollar limitation in
      effect under section 415(b)(1)(A) of the Code.

      If any Employee is a family member of either a five percent (5%) owner
      who is an active or former Employee or a Highly Compensated Employee who
      is one of the ten most Highly Compensated Employees ranked on the basis
      of Compensation paid by the Employer during such year, then the family
      member and the five-percent owner or top- ten Highly Compensated Employee
      shall be aggregated.  In such case, the family member and five  percent
      owner or top-ten Highly Compensated Employee shall be treated as a single
      Employee receiving Compensation and Plan contributions or benefits equal
      to the sum of such Compensation and contributions or benefits of the
      family member and five percent owner or top-ten Highly Compensated
      Employee.  For

      purposes of this Section 2.24, family member includes the Spouse, lineal
      ascendants and descendants of the Employee or former Employee, and the

      The determination of who is a Highly Compensated Employee, including the
      determination of the number and identity of Employees in the top-paid
      group, the top one hundred (100) Employees, the number of Employees
      treated as officers and the Compensation that is considered, will be made
      in accordance with section 414(q) of the Code and the Regulations
      thereunder.

      Beginning August 1, 1995, salaried Employees shall be credited with an
      Hour of Service for each hour such Employee is paid or entitled to
      payment for the performance of services.  These hours will be credited to
      the Employee for the computation period in which the duties are
      performed.

b.    Each hour for which an Employee is paid, or entitled to payment, by the
      Employer on account of a period of time during which no duties are
      performed (irrespective of whether the employment relationship has

      Disability), layoff, jury duty, military duty, or leave of absence.  No
      more than five hundred one (501) Hours of Service will be credited under
      this paragraph for any single continuous period (whether or not such
      period occurs in a single computation period).  Hours under this
      paragraph will be calculated and credited pursuant to section 2530.200b-2
      of the Department of Labor regulations which is incorporated herein by
      this reference; and

c.    Each hour for which back pay, irrespective of mitigation of damages, is
      either awarded or agreed to by the Employer.  The same Hours of Service
      will not be credited both under paragraph (a) or paragraph (b), as the
      case may be, and under this paragraph (c).  These hours will be credited
      to the Employee for the computation period or periods to which the award
      or agreement pertains rather than the computation period in which the
      award, agreement, or payment is made.

and vesting purposes has occurred in a computation period, an individual who is
absent from work for maternity or paternity reasons shall receive credit for
the Hours of Service which would otherwise have been credited to such
individual but for such absence, or in any case in which such hours cannot be

of this paragraph, an absence from work for maternity or paternity reasons

of a child with the individual in connection with the adoption of such child by
such individual, or (4) for purposes of caring for such child for a period
beginning immediately following such birth or placement.  The Hours of Service
credited under this paragraph shall be credited (1) in the computation period
in which the absence begins, if the crediting is necessary to prevent a break
in service in that period, or (2) in all other cases, in the following
computation period.

However, no credit will be given for such absences from work, unless the
Employee furnishes to the Committee such timely information as it may
reasonably require to establish that the absence from work is for the reason(s)
referred to above, and the number of days for which there was such an absence.

              options as would otherwise apply to a distribution of Company
              Stock from the Plan.  This subsection (c)(1) shall apply
              notwithstanding any other provisions of the Plan other than such
              provisions as require the consent of the Participant to a
              distribution with a present value in excess of $3,500.  If the
              Participant does not consent, such amount shall be retained in
              this Plan.

      2.      In lieu of a distribution under subsection (c)(1), the Qualified
              Participant who has the right to receive a cash distribution
              under subsection (c)(1) above may direct the Plan to transfer the
              portion of the Participant's Account that is covered by the
              election to any qualified plan of the Company which accepts such
              transfers, provided that such plan permits employee directed
              investment, such plan offers at least three (3) investment
              options other than Company Stock consistent with regulations to
              be issued by the Secretary of the Department of Labor and such
              plan does not invest in Company Stock to a substantial degree.
              Such transfer shall be made no later than ninety days after the
              last day of the period during which the election can be made.

d.    Pursuant to this Section 4.07, each Participant is authorized and
      empowered, in such Participant's sole and absolute discretion, to give
      directions to the Trustee in such form as the Trustee may require
      concerning the investment of the Participant's Account, which directions
      must be followed by the Trustee.  Neither the Trustee nor any other
      persons including Committee or otherwise shall be under any duty to
      question any such direction of the Participant or to make any suggestions
      to the Participant in connection therewith, and the Trustee shall comply
      as promptly as practicable with directions given by the Participant
      hereunder.  Any such direction may be of a continuing nature or otherwise
      and may be revoked by the Participant at any time in such form as the
      Trustee may require.  The Trustee may refuse to comply with any direction
      from the Participant in the event the Trustee, in its sole and absolute
      discretion, deems such direction improper by virtue of applicable law.
      The Trustee shall not be responsible or liable for any loss or expense
      which may result from the Trustee's refusal or failure to





                                       17
<PAGE>   24
      comply with any directions from the Participant.  Any costs and expenses
      related to compliance with the Participant's directions shall be borne by
      the Participant's Account.


SECTION 4.08  ACQUISITION LOANS.

The Company may direct the Trustee to incur Acquisition Loans from time to time
to finance the acquisition of Company Stock for the Trust or to repay a prior
Acquisition Loan, provided such loan is primarily for the benefit of
Participants and their Beneficiaries and such Acquisition Loan meets the
following requirements:

a.    The terms of an Acquisition Loan, at the time the Acquisition Loan is
      made, must be at least as favorable to the Plan as the terms of a
      comparable loan resulting from arm's-length negotiations between
      independent parties.

b.    The Acquisition Loan shall be for a specific term, shall bear a
      reasonable rate of interest, and, except in the event of default, shall
      not be payable on demand.  In determining what is a reasonable rate of
      interest, all relevant factors will be considered, including the amount
      and duration of the loan, the security and guarantee (if any) involved,
      the credit standing of the Plan and Trust and the guarantor (if any) and
      the interest rate prevailing for comparable loans.  A variable rate of
      interest is permissible if determined to be reasonable.

c.    In the event of a default on the Acquisition Loan, the value of Trust
      Funds transferred in satisfaction of the loan shall not exceed the amount
      of the default.  If the lender is a "disqualified person" (within the
      meaning of Code section 4975(e)(2)), or a party in interest (within the
      meaning of ERISA section 3(14)), the Acquisition Loan must provide for a
      transfer of Trust Funds, or plan assets upon default only upon and to the
      extent of the failure of the Plan to meet the payment schedule of the
      Acquisition Loan.

d.    The Acquisition Loan may require that the Company or an Affiliate
      guarantee repayment, and the Acquisition Loan may be secured by a
      collateral pledge of the Financed Shares so acquired (or Financed Shares
      acquired with a previous Acquisition Loan now repaid with the current
      Acquisition Loan proceeds).  No other Trust Funds, or any assets of the
      Plan, may be pledged as collateral for an Acquisition Loan, and no lender
      shall have recourse against Trust Funds, or any assets of the plan, other
      than Financed Shares remaining subject to a pledge, other collateral
      given for the Acquisition Loan, Employer Contributions (other than
      contributions of Company Stock) made for the purpose of satisfying the
      Acquisition Loan, and earnings on such Financed Shares, Employer
      Contributions, and such other assets of the Plan, if any, as permitted
      recourse under Code section 4975.  Any pledge of Financed Shares must
      specifically provide for the release of shares so pledged in accordance
      with Section 5.04.  Such Financed Shares shall be allocated to
      Participants' Accounts, as provided in Article V.





                                       18
<PAGE>   25
e.    Repayments of principal and interest on any Acquisition Loan shall be
      made by the Trustee (as directed by the Company or Committee) only from
      (1) Employer Contributions, paid in cash to enable the repayment of such
      Acquisition Loan; (2) Financed Shares or other collateral given for the
      loan; (3) earnings on such Employer Contributions and any cash dividends
      or other earnings received by the Trust on such Financed Shares; (4)
      earnings attributable to such permissible collateral other than Financed
      Shares; and (5) the proceeds of a subsequent Acquisition Loan incurred to
      repay an existing Acquisition Loan.  The Committee shall instruct the
      Trustee as to the priority and source of Acquisition Loan repayments.

f.    The repayments made with respect to an Acquisition Loan during a Plan
      Year must not exceed an amount equal to the sum of Employer Contributions
      and earnings received during or prior to such Plan Year, less such
      payments in prior Plan Years.  Such Employer Contributions and earnings
      must be accounted for separately in the books of account of the Plan
      until the Acquisition Loan is repaid.

g.    All proceeds of an Acquisition Loan shall be used within a reasonable
      time after receipt by the Trustee only to purchase Company Stock, or to
      repay amounts under any Acquisition Loan.

h.    Except as provided herein or in Section 4.08(i) below, no Company Stock
      acquired with the proceeds of a loan described herein may be subject to a
      put, call, or other option, or buy-sell or similar arrangement while held
      by and when distributed from the Plan or its related Trust, whether or
      not the Plan is then an "ESOP" within the ambit of section
      54.4975-7(b)(4) of the Regulations, unless specifically required or
      permitted by such Regulations.  A holder ("Shareholder") of shares of
      Company Stock which have been distributed by the Trustee, may not, for
      valuable consideration, sell, assign, pledge, convey in trust, or
      otherwise transfer or encumber in any manner or by any means whatever
      ("Transfer") any interest in all or any part of Company Stock held by
      him, except in accordance with the terms and conditions of this Section
      4.08(h), if at the time of such Transfer the Company Stock is not
      publicly traded.  Provided, however, "Transfer" shall not include any
      transfer of such shares by reason of a Participant's death, any transfer
      to an alternate payee, or the transfer by a Participant or his surviving
      Spouse of the shares to an individual retirement account described in
      Code section 408(a) in a transaction described in Code section 402(a)(5).
      Upon the receipt of the Notice described below, the Company shall have
      the first option to purchase the shares to be Transferred by the
      Shareholder, and, if that option is not exercised in full by the Company,
      then Trustee shall have the option to purchase shares not purchased by
      the Company.  Prior to any proposed Transfer, the Shareholder must first
      give written notice ("Notice") to the Committee that he intends to
      Transfer his shares of Company Stock or any interest therein, which
      Notice shall state the number of shares to be Transferred, the name of
      the proposed transferee, the consideration for the proposed Transfer and
      the terms and conditions of the Transfer.  The Shareholder shall also
      submit with the Notice copies of all papers and other documents to be
      used in





                                       19
<PAGE>   26
      connection with the proposed Transfer.  Any deviation in the terms of
      such Transfer, however slight, shall require a new Notice thereby
      effecting a new option under this Section 4.08(h).

i.    Any Company Stock acquired with the proceeds of an Acquisition Loan, if
      it is not publicly traded when distributed or is subject to a trading
      limitation when distributed, must be subject to a put option.  The put
      option is to be exercisable only by the Participant, the Participant's
      donees, an alternate payee, a person (including an estate or its
      distributee) to whom the Company Stock passes by reason of a
      Participant's death, or the custodian or trustee of an individual
      retirement account described in Code section 408(a) established by the
      Participant or such Participant's surviving Spouse.  The put option must
      permit the Participant to put the Company Stock to the Company.  The put
      option must be exercisable during the sixty (60) consecutive days
      beginning on the date that the Company Stock subject to the put option is
      distributed by the Plan, and for another sixty (60) consecutive days
      during the Plan Year next following the Plan Year in which the shares
      were distributed.  The put option may be exercised by the holder
      notifying the Company in writing that the put option is being exercised.
      The period during which a put option is exercisable does not include any
      period when a distributee is unable to exercise it because the party
      bound by the put option is prohibited from honoring it by applicable
      federal or state law.  The price at which the put option is exercisable
      is the fair market value of the Company Stock determined in good faith
      based on all relevant factors, determined as of the most recent Valuation
      Date.  The fair market value of each share shall, for this purpose, be
      determined on an enterprise basis without minority discount.

      Payment pursuant to the put option shall be made: (1) in the case of
      distribution of the Participant's entire Account within one taxable year
      of the recipient, no less rapidly than in substantially equal
      installments at least annually over a period beginning no later than
      thirty (30) days after the exercise of the put option and not exceeding
      five (5) years in all; adequate security shall be provided and reasonable
      interest shall be paid on any installments outstanding after thirty (30)
      days after exercise of the put option; and (2) in the case of any other
      form of distribution not described in (1), within thirty (30) days of the
      exercise of the put option. Payment pursuant to the put option shall be
      made no less rapidly than in substantially equal installments at least
      annually over a period beginning no later than thirty (30) days after the
      put option and not exceeding five (5) years in all, except that the
      repayment period may be extended to a date no later than ten (10) years
      after the earlier of the date the put option is exercised or the date of
      final repayment of any debt incurred in connection with the acquisition
      of the Company Stock. The provisions described in this Section 4.08(i)
      are nonterminable, even if the Acquisition Loan is repaid or the Plan
      ceases to be an employee stock ownership plan.

SECTION 4.09  ACCOUNTING FOR FINANCED SHARES.

If Financed Shares are acquired by the Trustee with the proceeds of an
Acquisition Loan, such Financed Shares shall be credited to the Loan Suspense
Account and accounted for separately both before and after their release from
the Loan Suspense Account.



                                   ARTICLE V
                      ALLOCATIONS, VALUATION, AND VESTING

SECTION 5.01  ALLOCATION OF EMPLOYER CONTRIBUTIONS AND FORFEITURES.

As of the Valuation Date, Employer Contributions and Forfeitures for the Plan
Year shall be allocated to the Accounts of each Participant described in
Section 5.02 in the ratio that each Participant's Compensation bears to the sum
of the Compensation of all Participants eligible to receive an allocation for
that Plan Year in accordance with Section 5.02 of the Plan.


SECTION 5.02  PARTICIPANTS ELIGIBLE TO RECEIVE AN ALLOCATION.

Each Plan Year, Employer Contributions made pursuant to Section 4.01 shall be
allocated to the Accounts of those Participants who either (i) are employed on
the last day of the Plan Year (including those Participants who are on a
temporary seasonal lay-off) or (ii) ceased to be an Employee during the year
because of death, Disability or attainment of Early or Normal Retirement Age.


SECTION 5.03  ALLOCATION LIMITATIONS.

The following sets forth limitations as to amounts which may be allocated to a
Participant's Accounts for a given Plan Year.

a.    This subsection (a) applies if the Participant does not participate in,
      and has never participated in another qualified plan maintained by the
      Employer, or a welfare benefit fund, as defined in section 419(e) of the
      Code maintained by the Employer, or an individual medical account, as
      defined in section 415(l)(2) of the Code, maintained by the Employer,
      which provides an Annual Addition as defined in Subsection (d)(1).

      1.      The amount of Annual Additions which may be credited to the
              Participant's Accounts for any Limitation Year, as defined in
              Subsection (d)(8), shall not exceed the lesser of the Maximum
              Permissible Amount, as defined in Subsection (d)(9), or any other
              limitation contained in this Plan.  If the contributions that
              would otherwise be contributed or allocated to the Participant's
              Accounts would cause the Annual Additions for the Limitation





                                       21
<PAGE>   28
              Year to exceed the Maximum Permissible Amount, the amount
              contributed or allocated will be reduced, so that the Annual
              Additions for the Limitation Year shall equal the Maximum
              Permissible Amount.

      2.      As soon as is administratively feasible after the end of the
              Limitation Year, the Maximum Permissible Amount for the
              Limitation Year will be determined on the basis of the
              Participant's actual Compensation, as defined in Subsection
              (d)(2), for the Limitation Year.

      3.      If there is an excess Annual Addition due to a calculation error,
              Employee contributions, the allocation of Forfeitures, or other
              facts and circumstances, as determined by the Committee, the
              Excess Amount will be corrected as follows:

              A.          The Excess Amount in the Participant's Accounts must
                          be allocated and reallocated to other Participants'
                          Accounts, to the extent permitted under this Section
                          5.03;

              B.          Remaining Excess Amounts will be held unallocated in
                          a suspense account.  The suspense account will be
                          allocated and reallocated to all Participants in the
                          next Limitation Year, and each succeeding Limitation
                          Year if necessary;

              C.          If a suspense account is in existence at any time
                          during a Limitation Year pursuant to this Section
                          5.03, it will not participate in the allocation of
                          the Trust's investment gains and losses.  If a
                          suspense account is in existence at any time during a
                          particular Limitation Year, all amounts in the
                          suspense account must be allocated and reallocated to
                          Participants' Accounts before any Employer or any
                          Employee contributions may be made to the Plan for
                          that Limitation Year.  Excess amounts may not be
                          distributed to Participants or former Participants.

b.    This subsection (b) applies if, in addition to this Plan, the Participant
      is covered under another qualified Defined Contribution Plan maintained
      by the Employer, a welfare benefit fund, as defined in section 419(e) of
      the Code maintained by the Employer, or an individual medical account, as
      defined in section 415(l)(2) of the Code, maintained by the Employer,
      which provides an Annual Addition, during any Limitation Year.

      1.      The Annual Additions which may be credited to a Participant's
              Accounts under this Plan for any such Limitation Year will not
              exceed the Maximum Permissible Amount reduced by the Annual
              Additions credited to a Participant's account under the other
              plans and welfare benefit funds for the same Limitation Year.  If
              the Annual Additions with respect to the Participant under other
              Defined Contribution Plans and welfare benefit funds maintained
              by the Employer are less than the Maximum Permissible Amount and
              the Employer contribution that would otherwise be contributed or
              allocated to the Participant's





                                       22
<PAGE>   29
              Accounts under the other Defined Contribution Plans would cause
              the Annual Additions for the Limitation Year to exceed this
              limitation, the amount contributed or allocated will be reduced
              so that the Annual Additions under all such plans and funds for
              the limitation year will equal the Maximum Permissible Amount.
              If the Annual Additions with respect to the Participant under
              this Plan are equal to or greater than the Maximum Permissible
              Amount, no amount will be contributed or allocated to the
              Participant's Account under other Defined Contribution Plans and
              welfare benefit funds for the Limitation Year.

      2.      As soon as is administratively feasible after the end of the
              Limitation Year, the Maximum Permissible Amount for the
              Limitation Year will be determined on the basis of the
              Participant's actual Compensation for the Limitation Year.

      3.      If, as a result of a calculation error, Employee contributions,
              the allocation of Forfeitures, or other facts and circumstances
              as determined by the Committee, a Participant's Annual Additions
              under this Plan and such other plans would result in an Excess
              Amount for a Limitation Year, the Excess Amount will be disposed
              of as follows:

              A.          The Excess Amount shall be reduced or eliminated by
                          refunding any contributions made by the Participant
                          under the other plan, together with earnings thereon;

              B.          The remaining Excess Amount will be deemed to consist
                          of the Annual Additions last allocated, except that
                          Annual Additions attributable to a welfare benefit
                          fund or individual medical account will be deemed to
                          have been allocated first, regardless of the actual
                          allocation date;

              C.          If an Excess Amount was allocated to a Participant on
                          an allocation date of this Plan which coincides with
                          an allocation date of another plan, the excess amount
                          attributed to the Plan will be the product of,

                          i.      the total excess amount allocated as of such
                                  date, times

                          ii.     the ratio of (a) the Annual Additions
                                  allocated to the Participant for the
                                  Limitation Year as of such date under this
                                  Plan to (b) the total Annual Additions
                                  allocated to the Participant for the
                                  Limitation Year as of such date under this
                                  and all other qualified Defined Contributions
                                  Plans;

              D.          Any Excess Amount attributed to this Plan will be
                          disposed in the manner described in Subsection
                          (a)(3).





                                       23
<PAGE>   30
      4.      If an excess amount was allocated to a Participant on an
              allocation date of this Plan which coincides with an allocation
              date of another plan, the excess amount attributed to this Plan
              will be the product of,

              A.          the total excess amount allocated as of such date, 
                          times

              B.          the ratio of (i) the annual additions allocated to
                          the Participant for the Limitation Year as of such
                          date under this Plan to (ii) the total Annual
                          Additions allocated to the Participant for the
                          Limitation Year as of such date under this and all
                          other qualified Defined Contribution Plans.

      5.      Any excess amount attributed to this Plan will be disposed in the
              manner described in Subsection (a)(3).

c.    If the Employer maintains, or at any time maintained, a qualified Defined
      Benefit Plan covering any Participant in this Plan, the sum of the
      Participant's Defined Benefit Plan fraction and Defined Contribution Plan
      fraction will not exceed 1.0 in any limitation year.  If the sum of the
      fractions exceeds 1.0, the annual benefit provided under the Defined
      Benefit Plan will be reduced until the sum of the fractions equals 1.0.

d.    Throughout this Section 5.03, certain words and phrases have meanings
      which are specifically defined for purposes of Section 5.03 of the Plan.
      These words and phrases can be identified in that the first letter of the

      1.      "Annual Additions" means the sum of the following amounts
              credited to a Participant's Account for the Limitation Year:

              A.          Employer Contributions;

              B.          Employee after-tax contributions;

              C.          Forfeitures;

              D.          amounts allocated, to an individual medical account,
                          as defined in section 415(l)(2) of the Code, which is
                          part of a pension or annuity plan maintained by the
                          Employer; and

              E.          amounts derived from contributions paid or accrued
                          after December 31, 1985, in taxable years ending
                          after such date, which are attributable to
                          post-retirement medical benefits, allocated to the
                          separate account of a key employee, as defined in
                          section 416(i)(1) of the Code, under a





                                       24
<PAGE>   31
                          welfare benefit fund, as defined in section 419(e) of
                          the Code, maintained by the Employer.

                          For this purpose, any excess amount applied under
                          Subsections (a)(3) or (b)(3) in the Limitation Year
                          to reduce Employer Contributions will be considered
                          Annual Additions for such Limitation Year.

              Notwithstanding the above, if no more than one-third of the
              Employer Contributions which are used to repay the principal of
              Acquisition Loans are allocated to Highly Compensated Employees,
              Forfeitures of Company Stock acquired with the proceeds of an
              Acquisition Loan and Employer Contributions used to pay interest
              on an Acquisition Loan shall not be considered Annual Additions
              for the purpose of this Section 5.03.

      2.      "Compensation" means all amounts paid or made available to a
              Participant during a Plan Year which amounts are treated as
              compensation under Treasury Regulation section 1.415-2(d)(10) and
              which amounts are not excluded from compensation under Treasury
              Regulation section 1.415-2(d)(3).  Compensation for a Limitation
              Year is the Compensation actually paid or includible in gross
              income during such Limitation Year.

      3.      "Defined Benefit Fraction" means a fraction, the numerator of
              which is the sum of the Participant's Projected Annual Benefits
              under all the Defined Benefit Plans (whether or not terminated)
              maintained by the Employer, and the denominator of which is the
              lesser of (i) one hundred twenty-five percent (125%) of the
              dollar limitation determined for the limitation year under
              sections 415(b)(1)(A) and (d) of the Code or (ii) one hundred
              forty percent (140%) of the Highest Average Compensation,
              including any adjustments under section 415(b) of the Code.

      4.      "Defined Contribution Dollar Limitation" means $30,000 or if
              greater, one-fourth (1/4) of the defined benefit dollar
              limitation set forth in section 415(b)(1)(A) of the Code as
              indexed as in effect for the Limitation Year.

      5.      "Defined Contribution Fraction" means a fraction, the numerator
              of which is the sum of the Annual Additions to the Participant's
              Account under all the Defined Contribution Plans (whether or not
              terminated) maintained by the Employer for the current and all
              prior Limitation Years (including the Annual Additions
              attributable to the Participant's nondeductible Employee
              contributions to all Defined Benefit Plans, whether or not
              terminated, maintained by the Employer, and the Annual Additions
              attributable to all welfare benefit funds, as defined in section
              419(e) of the Code, and individual medical accounts, as defined
              in section 415(1)(2) of the Code, maintained by the Employer),
              and the denominator of which is the sum of the maximum aggregate
              amounts for the current and all prior Limitation Years with the
              Employer (regardless of whether


                                       25
<PAGE>   32
              a Defined Contribution Plan was maintained by the Employer).  The
              maximum aggregate amount in any Limitation Year is the lesser of
              (i) one hundred twenty-five percent (125%) of the dollar
              limitation in effect under section 415(c)(1)(A) of the Code,
              without regard to section 415(c)(6), or (ii) one hundred forty
              percent (140%) times twenty-five percent (25%) of the
              Participant's Compensation for such year.

      6.      "Employer" means the Company and all Affiliates that adopt this
              Plan, and all members of a controlled group of corporations (as
              defined in section 414(b) of the Code as modified by section
              415(h)), all commonly controlled trades or businesses (as defined
              in section 414(c) as modified by section 415(h)) or affiliated
              service groups (as defined in section 414(m)) of which the
              Company is part, and any other entity required to be aggregated
              with the Company pursuant to Regulations under section 414(o) of
              the Code.

      7.      "Excess Amount" means the excess of the Participant's Annual
              Additions for the Limitation Year over the Maximum Permissible
              Amount.

      8.      "Limitation Year" means the Plan Year.  If the limitation year is
              amended to a different twelve-consecutive-month period, the new
              limitation year must begin on a date within the limitation year
              in which the amendment is made.

      9.      "Maximum Permissible Amount" means the maximum Annual Addition
              that may be contributed or allocated to a Participant's Accounts
              under the Plan for any Limitation Year which shall not exceed the
              lesser of:

              A.          the Defined Contribution Dollar Limitation (i.e.,
                          $30,000, or if greater, twenty-five percent (25%) of
                          the Code section 415(b)(1)(A) amount), or

              B.          twenty-five percent (25%) of the Participant's
                          Compensation for the Limitation Year.

              The Compensation limitation referred to in (B) shall not apply to
              any contribution for medical benefits (within the meaning of
              section 401(h) or section 419A(f)(2) of the Code) which is
              otherwise treated as an Annual Addition under sections 415(l)(1)
              or 419A(d)(2) of the Code.

              If a short limitation year is created because of an amendment
              changing the limitation year to a different
              twelve-consecutive-month period, the Maximum Permissible Amount
              shall not exceed the defined contribution dollar limitation
              multiplied by the following fraction:

                 Number of months in the short limitation year
                 ---------------------------------------------
                                       12

                                        
                                       26
<PAGE>   33
      10.     "Projected Annual Benefit" means the annual retirement benefit
              (adjusted to an actuarially equivalent straight life annuity, if
              such benefit is expressed in a form other than a straight life
              annuity or qualified joint and survivor annuity) to which the
              Participant would be entitled under the terms of the Plan
              assuming:

              A.          The Participant will continue employment until Normal
                          Retirement Age under the Plan (or current age, if
                          later); and

              B.          The Participant's Compensation for the current
                          Limitation Year and all other relevant factors used
                          to determine benefits under the Plan will remain
                          constant for all future Limitation Years.


SECTION 5.04  ALLOCATION OF FINANCED SHARES.

All Company Stock acquired by the Trust with the proceeds of an Acquisition
Loan must be added to and maintained in the Loan Suspense Account.  Such
Company Stock shall be released and withdrawn from that account as if all
Company Stock in that account were encumbered.  For each Plan Year during the
duration of the Acquisition Loan, the number of shares of Company Stock
released from the Loan Suspense Account for allocation to Participant Accounts
as set forth in writing in the pledge of the Financed Shares shall equal the
number of Financed Shares in the Loan Suspense Account immediately before
release for that Plan Year multiplied by the ratio that the payments of
principal and interest on the Acquisition Loan for that Plan Year bear to the
total projected payments of principal and interest over the duration of the
Acquisition Loan repayment period (including the principal and interest on the
Acquisition Loan for that Plan Year).  If interest under any loan is variable,
then for purposes of this paragraph, interest to be paid in future periods
shall be determined by using the rate thereof applicable at the end of the Plan
Year.

Notwithstanding the preceding paragraph, in the sole discretion of the
Committee, the number of shares of Company Stock released from the Loan
Suspense Account for any Acquisition Loan, as set forth in writing in the
pledge of the Financed Shares, may be determined using the principal-only
method set forth in section 54.4975-7(b)(8)(ii) of the Regulations.

The shares released pursuant to the repayment of an Acquisition Loan with funds
from Employer Contributions shall be allocated to the Participants' Company
Stock Accounts in the same manner as Employer Contributions are allocated under
Section 5.02.  The shares released pursuant to the repayment of an Acquisition
Loan with funds from cash dividends on Company Stock shall be allocated in the
manner set forth in Section 5.05.  The shares released pursuant to the
repayment of an Acquisition Loan with funds from Participants' Other
Investments Accounts or net income from such Accounts shall be allocated in the
manner set forth in Section 5.07.





                                       27
<PAGE>   34
SECTION 5.05  ALLOCATION OF CASH DIVIDENDS.

Allocation of cash dividends paid with respect to Company Stock held in the
Trust shall be made as follows:

a.    Except as provided in Section 5.05(b), pursuant to the Committee's
      direction to the Trustee, all or a portion of the cash dividends on
      Allocated Shares shall be paid to the Plan and distributed in cash to the
      Participants and Beneficiaries no later than ninety (90) days after the
      close of the Plan Year in which paid.  To the extent not distributed,
      cash dividends shall be credited as earnings to the Company Stock Account
      holding the Company Stock to which they relate, or used to repay the
      Acquisition Loan with respect to such shares of Company Stock.

b.    For any Plan Year during which repayment of an Acquisition Loan is made
      in whole or in part with dividends paid on shares of Company Stock that
      have been allocated to Participants' Accounts, a special dividend
      allocation shall be determined for each Participant and such Employer
      Contribution shall be in addition to any other contribution or allocation
      required under the Plan.  The special dividend allocation shall be in the
      form of Company Stock with a fair market value of not less than the
      amount of such dividends.

c.    Pursuant to the Committee's direction to the Trustee, cash dividends paid
      on Unallocated Shares shall be used to make payments on an Acquisition
      Loan.  Shares released due to cash dividends paid on Unallocated Shares
      used to make payments on an Acquisition Loan shall be allocated as
      follows:

      1.      first, to the Participant's Company Stock Accounts to the extent
              necessary to satisfy subparagraph (b) of this Section 5.05; and

      2.      then, to the Participants' Accounts in the same manner as
              Employer Contributions are allocated pursuant to Section 5.02.


SECTION 5.06  ALLOCATION OF STOCK DIVIDENDS.

Except as provided in section 5.05(b), any Company Stock received by the
Trustee as a result of a stock split, dividend, conversion, or as a result of a
reorganization or other recapitalization of a Company shall be allocated as
Trust Fund earnings as of the day on which the Company Stock is received by the
Trustee to each Participant's Company Stock Account and to the Loan Suspense
Account in the ratio that each such Account bears to the sum of all such
Accounts.





                                       28
<PAGE>   35
SECTION 5.07  ALLOCATION OF INCOME.

The assets of the Trust shall be valued on the Valuation Date at fair market
value.  On such date, the earnings, gains, losses, and expenses attributable to
the assets in all of the Participants' Accounts shall be allocated to each
Participant's Other Investment Account in the ratio that such Participant's
Other Investment Account bears to all Other Investment Account balances.


SECTION 5.08  ADJUSTMENTS FOR ALLOCATION ERROR.

If, in any Plan Year, any Employee who should be considered a Participant is
omitted from receiving an allocation or receives less than such Participant is
entitled, and such omission is determined to be erroneous, the Employer shall
then make a subsequent contribution with respect to the omitted Employee in the
amount which the Employer would have contributed with respect to such Employee
had the omission not occurred.

SECTION 5.09  VALUATIONS.

The Committee shall direct the Trustee, as of the Valuation Date, and at such
other date or dates deemed necessary by the Committee, to determine the net
worth of the assets comprising the Trust Fund, as it exists on such date prior
to taking into consideration any contribution to be allocated for that Plan
Year.  In determining such net worth, the Trustee shall value the assets
comprising each Trust Fund at their fair market value as of the such date and
shall deduct all expenses for which the Trustee has not yet obtained
reimbursement from the Employer or the Trust Fund.

Valuations must be made in good faith and based on all relevant factors for
determining the fair market value of securities.  In the case of a transaction
between a Plan and a disqualified person as defined in section 4975(e)(2) of
the Code, value must be determined as of the date of the transaction.  For all
other Plan purposes, value must be determined as of the most recent Valuation
Date under the Plan.  An independent appraisal will not in itself be a good
faith determination of value in the case of a transaction between the Plan and
a disqualified person.  However, in other cases, a determination of fair market
value based on at least an annual appraisal independently arrived at by a
person who customarily makes such appraisals and who is independent of any
party to the transaction will be deemed to be a good faith determination of
value.  Company Stock not readily tradable on an established securities market
shall be valued by an independent appraiser meeting requirements similar to the
requirements of the Regulations prescribed under section 170(a)(1) of the Code.


SECTION 5.10  VESTING.

This Section 5.10 sets forth rules for determining a Participant's Vested
interest in his or her Accounts.





                                       29
<PAGE>   36
a.    The Vested percentage of a Participant's Accounts is determined as
follows:

<TABLE>
<CAPTION>
                                                                                                           Vested
              Years of Service:                                                                          Percentage:
              -----------------                                                                          ----------- 
      <S>                                                                                                    <C>
      Less than 3 years                                                                                        0%
      At least 3, but less than 4 years                                                                       20%
      At least 4, but less than 5 years                                                                       40%
      At least 5, but less than 6 years                                                                       60%
      At least 6, but less than 7 years                                                                       80%
      7 or more years                                                                                        100%
</TABLE>

b.    Notwithstanding the Vesting specified above, each Participant shall be
      one hundred percent (100%) Vested in the full balance of such
      Participant's Accounts upon Normal Retirement, Early Retirement, death,
      and Disability.

c.    For purposes of computing a Participant's Vested right to such
      Participant's Accounts, Years of Service and breaks in service will be
      measured by the Plan Year.  All of a Participant's Years of Service with
      the Company or an Affiliate are counted to determine the nonforfeitable
      percentage of the Participant's Accounts.

d.    A Participant's Years of Service before a Break in Service shall be
      treated as follows:

      1.      In the case of a Participant who has incurred a One-Year Break in
              Service, Years of Service before such break will not be taken
              into account until the Participant has completed a Year of
              Service after such break in service.

      2.      In the case of any Participant who has five (5) or more One-Year
              Breaks in Service, all service after such Breaks in Service will
              be disregarded for the purposes of vesting the portion of his
              Account balance that accrued before such breaks in service.

      3.      In the case of a Participant who has any Vested interest in his
              Accounts (i.e., whose Vested percentage under Section 5.10(a)
              exceeds 0%), all service prior to such Breaks in Service will be
              taken into account for the purposes of vesting the portion of his
              Account balance that accrues after any such breaks in service.

      4.      In the case of a non-Vested (i.e., a 0%-Vested) Participant who
              has five (5) or more consecutive One-Year Breaks in Service, all
              service prior to such Breaks in Service will be disregarded for
              the purposes of vesting the portion of his Account balance that
              accrues after such Breaks in Service unless upon returning to
              service the number of consecutive One-Year Breaks in Service is
              less than the number of Years of Service.


                                       30
<PAGE>   37
              If such service is disregarded, separate accounts will be
              maintained for the Participant's pre-break and post-break
              Employer-derived Account.  Both Accounts shall share in the
              earnings and losses of the fund.

e.    If any previous Participant shall be reemployed by the Employer before a
      One-Year Break in Service occurs, such Participant shall continue to
      participate in the Plan in the same manner as if such termination had not
      occurred.  If any previous Participant shall be reemployed by the
      Employer after incurring a One-Year Break in Service, and such previous
      Participant received a distribution of such Participant's  entire Vested
      interest (including where the Participant had no Vested amount in his
      account) prior to reemployment, such Participant's forfeited Account
      shall be restored only if the Participant repays the full amount
      distributed before the earlier of five (5) years after the first date on
      which the Participant is subsequently reemployed by the Employer or the
      close of the first period of five (5) consecutive One-Year Breaks in
      Service commencing after the distribution.  If a distribution occurs for
      any reason other than a separation from service, the time for repayment
      may not end earlier than five (5) years after the date of the
      distribution.  In the event the former Participant repays the full amount
      distributed, the undistributed portion of the Participant's Account must
      be restored in full, unadjusted by gains or losses occurring after the
      Valuation Date preceding the distribution.

f.    If the Plan's vesting schedule is changed or amended, or the Plan is
      amended in any way that directly or indirectly affects the computation of
      the Participant's nonforfeitable percentage, each Participant with at
      least three Years of Service with the Employer may elect, within a
      reasonable period after the adoption of the amendment or change, to have
      the Vested percentage computed under the Plan without regard to such
      amendment or change.  The period during which the election may be made
      shall commence with the date the amendment is adopted or deemed to be
      made and shall end on the latest of:

      1.      sixty (60) days after the amendment is adopted;

      2.      sixty (60) days after the amendment becomes effective; or

      3.      sixty (60) days after the Participant is issued written notice of
              amendment by the Employer or Plan Committee.

      If the vesting schedule of the Plan is amended, in the case of an
      Employee who is a Participant as of the later of the date such amendment
      is adopted or the date it becomes effective, the nonforfeitable
      percentage (determined as of such date) of such Employee's right to such
      Participant's Employer-derived Account shall not be less than such
      Participant's percentage computed under the Plan without regard to such
      amendment.

g.    If any previous Participant shall be reemployed by the Employer before a
      One-Year Break in Service occurs, and if a distribution is made to such
      Participant at a time when





                                       31
<PAGE>   38
      the Participant has a Vested right to less than one hundred percent
      (100%) of such Participant's Accounts, such Participant's Accounts shall
      have their Vested percentage increased as follows:

      1.      A separate Account shall be established for the Participant's
              interest in the Plan as of the time of the distribution, and

      2.      At any relevant time, the Participant's nonforfeitable portion of
              the separate Account will be equal to an amount ("X") determined
              by the formula:

              X = P(AB + (R x D)) - (R x D)

              For purposes of applying the formula: P is the Vested percentage
              at the relevant time, AB is the Account balance at the relevant
              time, D is the amount of the distribution, and R is the ratio of
              the Account balance at the relevant time to the Account balance
              after distribution.


                                   ARTICLE VI
                                 DISTRIBUTIONS

The Participant or Participant's Beneficiary, where applicable, may elect the
form or the time of the distribution where more than one type of distribution
is available.  

SECTION 6.01  DISTRIBUTIONS WHILE IN-SERVICE.

Except as provided in Section 6.10, this Plan does not provide for in-service
distributions.


SECTION 6.02  DISTRIBUTIONS UPON SEPARATION FROM SERVICE - SMALL ACCOUNT
              BALANCES.

If a Participant separates from service with the Employer prior to attaining
Normal Retirement Age for reasons other than death or Disability, and the value
of the Participant's Vested Account as determined pursuant to Section 5.09 as
of the immediately preceding Valuation Date adjusted for dividends on Company
Stock allocated under Section 5.05 or 5.06, is not greater than $3,500, the
Committee shall direct the Trustee to distribute the entire Vested portion of
such Account to the Participant as soon as administratively feasible in
accordance with this Article VI.  The nonvested portion shall be treated as a
Forfeiture.  If the value of a Participant's Vested Account is zero, the
Participant shall be deemed to have received a distribution of such Vested
Account.


                                       32
<PAGE>   39
SECTION 6.03  DISTRIBUTIONS UPON SEPARATION FROM SERVICE - ACCOUNT BALANCES
              OVER $3,500.

If a Participant separates from service with the Employer prior to attaining
Normal Retirement Age for reasons other than death or Disability and the value
of the Participant's Vested Account as determined pursuant to Section 5.09 as
of the immediately preceding Valuation Date adjusted for dividends on Company
Stock allocated under Section 5.05 or 5.06, exceeds $3,500, the Committee shall
direct the Trustee to distribute to the Participant the Vested portion of such
Participant's Account not later than the close of the Plan Year which is the
sixth Plan Year following the Plan Year in which the Participant separated from
service, if the Participant so elects.  The non-Vested portion of a
Participant's Account shall be treated as a Forfeiture.

With respect to a Participant's Account which is subject to this Section 6.03,
the Committee may direct the Trustee to segregate the value of such Account,
and invest the segregated amount thereof in a separate, federally insured
savings account, a certificate of deposit, common or collective trust fund of a
bank, or deferred annuity or any other investment deemed prudent by the
Committee until such time as the Account is distributed.  In the event the
value of such Vested Account is not segregated, the amounts shall remain in
separate accounts for the terminated Participant.


SECTION 6.04  DISTRIBUTIONS UPON RETIREMENT.

In the event that a Participant attains Early or Normal Retirement Age, all
Vested amounts credited to such Participant's Accounts shall become
distributable.  The Participant may continue employment with the Employer after
attaining Early or Normal Retirement Age, and shall continue to share in
Employer Contributions in accordance with Section 5.02.  Upon a Participant's
separation from service of the Employer following attainment of Early or Normal
Retirement Age, the Committee shall direct the Trustee to distribute to the
Participant the Vested portion of such Participant's Account balance, as
determined pursuant to Section 5.09 as of the immediately preceding Valuation
Date, adjusted for any dividends on Company Stock allocated under Section 5.05
or 5.06 not later than one year after the close of the Plan Year in which the
Participant separated from service, if the Participant so elects.


SECTION 6.05  DISTRIBUTIONS UPON DEATH.

Upon a Participant's death, the Committee shall direct the Trustee to
distribute the Participant's Vested Account balance, as determined pursuant to
Section 5.09 as of the immediately preceding Valuation Date, adjusted for any
dividends on Company Stock allocated under Section 5.05 or 5.06 to that
Participant's Beneficiary not later than one (1) year after the close of the
Plan Year in which the Participant died.  Notwithstanding the immediately
preceding sentence, in the case of a Beneficiary who is the Participant's
spouse, such Beneficiary may elect to defer commencement of benefits to a date
no later than the date


                                       33
<PAGE>   40
the Participant would have attained age seventy and one half (70 1/2).  The
Participant shall not name as a Beneficiary someone other than such
Participant's Spouse, unless and until the Participant and Spouse designate, in
writing on a valid waiver form provided by the Committee for such purpose, an
alternate Beneficiary, which designation shall be witnessed by a notary public.
In addition, the Participant may designate a Beneficiary other than such
Participant's Spouse if:  (1)  the Participant is legally separated or has been
abandoned and the Participant has a court order to such effect (and there is no
"qualified domestic relations order" as defined in section 414(p) of the Code);
(2)  the Participant has no Spouse; or (3)  the Spouse cannot be located.
Where the Participant makes no designation, the Beneficiary shall be the
Spouse, and if there is no Spouse, the Beneficiary shall be the Participant's
estate.  The Committee may require such proof of death and such evidence of the
right of other persons to be Beneficiaries as it shall deem proper under the
circumstances.  The Committee's determination of death and of the right of any
Beneficiary to receive payments shall be conclusive.  The designation of a
Beneficiary shall be made pursuant to a form approved by the Committee.  A
Participant may revoke or change a Beneficiary designation with the Committee
by filing same with the Committee.  In the event that no valid designation
exists at the time of the Participant's death, the death benefit shall be
payable to the estate.  If the Participant was eligible for any distribution or
distributions, but had not yet received all such distributions prior to death,
the Trustee will distribute any remaining amounts credited to the Accounts of
such Participant to the Beneficiary.


SECTION 6.06  DISTRIBUTIONS UPON DISABILITY.

Upon a Participant's Disability, the Committee shall direct the Trustee to
distribute to the Participant, the value of the Participant's Vested Account
balance, as determined pursuant to Section 5.09 as of the immediately preceding
Valuation Date, adjusted for any dividends on Company Stock allocated under
Section 5.05 or 5.06 not later than one year after the close of the Plan Year
in which the Disability arose, unless the Participant elects to defer
commencement of his benefits to a later date.


SECTION 6.07  SPECIAL BENEFICIARY PROVISIONS.

This Section 6.07 sets forth special distribution rules.

a.    If, after five (5) years have expired following reasonable efforts of the
      Committee to locate a Participant or Beneficiary, including sending a
      registered letter, return receipt requested to the last known address,
      the Committee is unable to locate the Participant or Beneficiary, then
      the amounts distributable to such Participant or Beneficiary shall,
      pursuant to applicable state and Federal laws, be treated as a Forfeiture
      under the Plan.  Where a Participant or Beneficiary is located subsequent
      to the Forfeiture, such benefits shall be reinstated by the Committee,
      and shall not count as an annual addition under section 415 of the Code.





                                       34
<PAGE>   41
b.    The Committee may instruct the Trustee to distribute a sum payable to a
      minor instead to his or her legal guardian, or if there is no guardian,
      to a parent or other responsible adult who maintains the residence of the
      minor.  In the alternative, such distribution could be made to the
      appropriate custodian under the Uniform Gifts to Minors Act or Gift to
      Minors Act, if applicable under the state laws of the state in which the
      minor resides.  Any payment in this method shall discharge all
      fiduciaries involved in the distribution including the Trustee, Employer,
      and Plan from liability regarding the transaction.

c.    A Participant's rights and benefits shall be subject to the rights
      afforded to an alternate payee under a qualified domestic relations
      order.  In connection with a proper qualified domestic relations order
      under section 414(p) of the Code, a distribution shall be permitted if
      such distribution is authorized by the qualified domestic relations
      order, even if the Participant has not achieved a distributable event
      under the Plan.

SECTION 6.08  CONSENT OF THE PARTICIPANT REQUIRED FOR DISTRIBUTION IF ACCOUNT
              BALANCES GREATER THAN $3,500.

If the value of a Participant's Vested Account balance exceeds (or at the time
of any prior distribution exceeded) $3,500, and the Account balance is
immediately distributable, the Participant (or where the Participant has died,
such Participant's Beneficiary) must consent to any distribution of such
Account balance.  An Account is immediately distributable if any part of the
Account could be distributed to the Participant (or Surviving Spouse) before
the Participant attains, or would have attained, if not deceased, the later of
Normal Retirement Age or age sixty-two (62).  If a Participant fails to consent
to a distribution of his Accounts, such failure shall be deemed to be an
election to defer the commencement of benefits.  A Participant shall be given
notice of such Participant's rights under this Section 6.08 no less than thirty
(30) days and no more than ninety (90) days before the first day on which all
events have occurred which entitle the Participant to such benefits, provided
that the Participant may waive the thirty (30) day period in the manner
permitted under section 411(a)(11) of the Code.

The consent of the Participant shall not be required to the extent that a
distribution is required to satisfy sections 401(a)(9) or 415 of the Code.  In
addition, upon termination of the Plan, if the Plan does not offer an annuity
option (purchased from a commercial provider) and if the Company or any
Affiliate does not maintain another Defined Contribution Plan (other than an
ESOP), the Participant's Accounts may, without the Participant's consent, be
distributed to the Participant.  However, if the Company or an Affiliate
maintains another Defined Contribution Plan (other than an ESOP), then the
Participant's Accounts shall be transferred, without the Participant's consent,
to such other plan, if the Participant does not consent to an immediate
distribution.





                                       35
<PAGE>   42
SECTION 6.09  COMMENCEMENT OF BENEFITS.

Notwithstanding any provision to the contrary, unless the Participant elects
otherwise, distribution of benefits shall begin no later than the sixtieth
(60th) day after the latest of the close of the Plan Year in which:

a.    the Participant attains age sixty-five (65) (or Normal Retirement Age, if
      earlier);

b.    occurs the tenth (10th) anniversary of the year in which the Participant
      commenced participation in the Plan; or

c.    the Participant terminates employment with the Employer.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, the failure of a Participant or Beneficiary to
consent to a distribution while a benefit is immediately distributable shall be
deemed to be an election to defer commencement of payment of any benefit
sufficient to satisfy this Section 6.09.


SECTION 6.10  REQUIRED DISTRIBUTIONS.

Notwithstanding any provision to the contrary, Participants who participate in
the Plan after age seventy and one half (70 1/2) must receive Required
Distributions in accordance with section 401(a)(9) of the Code the Regulations
thereunder.


SECTION 6.11  FINANCED SHARES.

Except as required under Section 6.10 and section 401(a)(9) of the Code, the
Trustee shall not distribute the portion of a Participant's Account
attributable to the shares of Company Stock acquired with the proceeds of an
Acquisition Loan until the close of the Plan Year in which such loan is repaid
in full.


SECTION 6.12  FORM OF DISTRIBUTION.

The Participant may elect to receive a distribution of such Participant's
Accounts in the form of a lump sum payment.  Unless the Participant elects
otherwise, distribution of the Participant's Accounts shall be in the form of
substantially equal annual payments, for a period not to exceed five (5) years;
provided, however, that in the case of a Participant with Accounts in excess of
$500,000, the five (5) year distribution period shall be increased by (1)
additional year (but not more than five (5) additional years) for each
$100,000, or fraction thereof, that the Participant's Account balances exceed
$500,000.  For purposes of this Section 6.12, the dollar amounts shall be
adjusted annually in the same manner as section 415(d) of the Code.
Participant election shall be made in a manner and using such forms as may be
prescribed by the Committee.





                                       36
<PAGE>   43
SECTION 6.13  METHOD OF PAYMENT.

At the time a Participant's Vested Account is to be distributed whether by
reason of death, Disability, retirement or separation from service prior to
Normal Retirement Age, the Committee shall determine the fair market value of
the Participant's Vested Account and the number of whole and fractional shares
of Company Stock allocated to such Participant's Company Stock Account
consistent with the valuation pursuant to Section 5.09 as of the most recent
Valuation Date.  The Committee shall direct the Trustee to distribute the
Participant's Vested Account balance within the time specified for distribution
in this Article VI by (1) delivery of Company Stock in the number of whole
shares to which the Participant or Beneficiary is entitled from his Company
Stock Account and (2) cash in an amount equal to the Vested balance of the
Participant's Other Investments Account.  Notwithstanding the preceding
sentence, a Participant or Beneficiary may elect to receive the value of such
Participant's Vested Other Investment Account entirely in whole shares of
Company Stock.  Any balance in the Participant's Other Investment Account shall
be applied to acquire for distribution the maximum number of whole shares of
Company Stock at the then fair market value. If Company Stock is not available
for purchase by the Trustee, it shall hold such balance until Company Stock is
acquired and then make such distribution.  Prior to making any distribution,
the Committee must notify the Participant in writing of this right to demand
that the value of such Participant's Vested Other Investment Accounts be
distributed solely in Company Stock.  The fair market value of fractional
shares in a Company Stock Account or Other Investment Account shall be
distributed in cash.

Notwithstanding any provision to the contrary, a Participant or Beneficiary
shall have no right to demand that the Accounts be distributed in the form of
Company Stock with respect to the portion of such Accounts which the
Participant elected to have diversified pursuant to Section 4.07 of the Plan.

If the Participant is entitled to a contribution or dividend for the last Plan
Year of participation in the Plan and such contribution or dividend is
allocated to such Participant's Account subsequent to the distribution of such
Participant's Vested Account, such amount shall be distributed as soon as
practicable after such amount is allocated to the Participant's Account.


SECTION 6.14  TRUSTEE-TO-TRUSTEE TRANSFERS.

The Trustee may make transfers directly to the trustee of another plan
qualified under section 401(a) of the Code.





                                       37
<PAGE>   44
SECTION 6.15  ROLLOVERS TO OTHER PLANS OR IRAS.

Notwithstanding any provision of the Plan to the contrary that would otherwise
limit a distributee's election under this Section 6.15, a distributee may
elect, at the time and in the manner prescribed by the Administrator, to have
any portion of an eligible rollover distribution paid directly to an eligible
retirement plan specified by the distributee in a direct rollover.  A
distributee may divide an eligible rollover distribution between a direct
rollover and payment to the distributee only if the total distribution is at
least five hundred dollars ($500).  Prior to making any election under this
Section 6.15, the distributee will receive notification in accordance with
section 402(f) of the Code provided that he may waive the thirty (30) day
period in the manner permitted thereunder.

DEFINITIONS:

a.    Eligible rollover distribution.  An eligible rollover distribution is any
      distribution of all or any portion of the balance to the credit of the
      distributee, except that an eligible rollover distribution does not
      include:

      1.      any distribution that is one of a series of substantially equal
              periodic payments (not less frequently than annually) made for
              the life (or life expectancy) of the distributee or the joint
              lives (or joint life expectancies) of the distributee and the
              distributee's beneficiary, or for a specified period of ten (10)
              years or more;

      2.      any distribution to the extent such distribution is required
              under section 401(a)(9) of the Code; and

      3.      the portion of any distribution that is not includible in gross
              income (determined without regard to the exclusion for net
              unrealized appreciation with respect to employer securities).

      Notwithstanding any provision of this Section 6.15 to the contrary, the
      distribution of amounts totaling less than two hundred dollars ($200) in
      any one year shall not be considered eligible rollover distribution(s).

b.    Eligible retirement plan.  An eligible retirement plan is an individual
      retirement account described in section 408(a) of the Code, an individual
      retirement annuity described in section 408(b) of the Code, an annuity
      plan described in section 403(a) of the Code, or a qualified trust
      described in section 401(a) of the Code, that accepts that distributee's
      eligible rollover distribution.  However, in the case of an eligible
      rollover distribution to the surviving spouse, an eligible retirement
      plan is an individual retirement account or individual retirement
      annuity.

c.    Distributee.  A distributee includes an employee or former employee.  In
      addition, the employee's or former employee's surviving spouse and the
      employee's or former employee's spouse or former spouse who is the
      alternate payee under a qualified


                                       38
<PAGE>   45
      domestic relations orders as defined in section 414(p) of the Code, are
      distributees with regard to the interest of the spouse or former spouse.

d.    Direct rollover.  A direct rollover is a payment by the plan to the
      eligible retirement plan specified by the distributee.


                                  ARTICLE VII
                         VOTING RIGHTS OF COMPANY STOCK

SECTION 7.01  VOTING RIGHTS.

Voting rights with respect to shares of Company Stock held in the Trust which
have been allocated to Participants' Accounts are passed-through to the
Participants.  Each Participant shall have the right to give written directions
to the Trustees on forms provided by the Trustee or Committee with respect to
all voting rights in the shares of Company Stock allocated to such
Participants' Accounts.  The Trustee shall vote fractional shares of Company
Stock allocated to Participant's Accounts in the aggregate to the greatest
extent possible to reflect the voting direction of the Participant to whose
Account fractional shares of Stock have been allocated.  If a Participant does
not direct the Trustee as to voting of all or any portion of the shares of
Company Stock allocated to such Participant's Accounts, such voting rights
shall be exercised by the Trustee only to the extent directed by the
Participant.  The Trustee shall vote all of the Unallocated Shares as directed
by the Committee.  Notwithstanding any provision of this Section 7.01 to the
contrary, the Trustee shall vote all Company Stock in accordance with its
fiduciary obligations under ERISA.


SECTION 7.02  NOTICE REQUIRED.

The Committee shall cause the Participants to be notified, not later than ten
days prior to the date such voting rights are to be exercised, of all questions
requiring a vote of the holders of shares of Company Stock.  The Committee
shall also cause to be included with such notice any materials and information
ordinarily supplied to other holders of Company Stock in connection with any
such vote.


                                  ARTICLE VIII

new Committee member.


SECTION 8.03  APPOINTMENT OF ADVISOR.

The Committee may employ such person as it deems necessary to assist in the
administration of the Plan including but not limited to tax advice; amendment,
termination, and operation of the Plan; and advice concerning reports filed
with the Internal Revenue Service.  Such advisor shall not be the Plan
Administrator (as defined in section 3(16) of ERISA and section 414(g) of the
Code).


SECTION 8.04  POWERS AND DUTIES OF THE COMMITTEE.

The Committee on behalf of the Participants and Beneficiaries of the Plan shall
enforce the Plan and Trust in accordance with their terms, and shall have all
powers necessary to carry out such provisions.  The Committee shall interpret
the Plan and Trust and shall determine all questions arising in the
administration and application of the Plan and Trust.  Any such interpretation
or determination by the Committee shall be conclusive and binding on all
persons.

The Committee shall establish rules and regulations necessary for the proper
conduct and administration of the Plan, and from time to time, shall change or
amend these rules and regulations.  The Committee shall also have the power to
authorize all disbursements by the Trustee from the Trust in accordance with
the Plan's terms.

SECTION 8.05  ORGANIZATION AND OPERATION.

The Committee shall act by a majority of its members at the time in office, and
such action may be taken either by a vote at a meeting or by written consent
without a meeting.  The Committee may authorize any one or more of its members
to execute any document or documents on behalf of the Committee, in which event
the Committee shall notify the Employer, in writing, of such authorization and
the name or names of its member or members so designated.  The Employer
thereafter shall accept and rely on any documents executed by said member of
the Committee or members as representing action by the Committee until the
Committee shall file with the Employer a written revocation of such
designation.

The Committee may adopt such bylaws and regulations as it deems desirable for
the conduct of its affairs and may employ and appropriately compensate such
accountants, counsel, specialists, actuaries, and other persons as it deems
necessary or desirable in connection with the administration and maintenance of
the Plan.  The Committee shall have the authority to control and manage the
operation and administration of the Plan.


SECTION 8.06  CLAIMS PROCEDURE.

a.    A claim for benefits under the Trust shall be filed on an application
      form supplied by the Committee.  Written notice of the disposition of the
      claim shall be furnished to the claimant within ninety (90) days after an
      application form is received by the Committee, unless special
      circumstances (as determined by the Committee) require an extension for
      processing the claim.  If such an extension is required, the Committee
      shall render a decision as soon as possible subsequent to the ninety (90)
      day period, but such decision shall not be rendered later than one
      hundred eighty (180) days after the application form is received by the
      Committee.  Written notice of such extension shall be furnished to the
      claimant prior to the commencement of the extension indicating the
      special circumstances requiring such extension and the date by which the
      Committee expects to render the decision on the claim.  In the event the
      claim is denied, the Committee shall set forth in writing the reasons for
      the denial and shall cite pertinent provisions of the Plan and Trust upon
      which the decision is based.  In addition, the Committee shall provide a
      description of any additional material or information necessary for the
      claimant to perfect the claim, an explanation of why such information is
      necessary, and appropriate information as to the steps to be taken if the
      Participant or Beneficiary wish to submit such claim for review as
      provided in (b) below.

b.    A Participant or Beneficiary whose claim described in (a) above has been
      denied in whole or in part shall be entitled to the following rights if
      exercised within sixty (60) days after written denial of a claim is
      received:

      1.      to request a review of the claim upon written application to the

<PAGE>   48
      3.      to submit issues and comments in writing to the Committee.

c.    If a Participant or a Beneficiary requests a review of the claim under
      (b) above, the Committee shall conduct a full review (including a formal
      hearing, if desired) of such request, and a decision on such request
      shall be made within sixty (60) days after the Committee has received the
      written request for review from the Participant or the Beneficiary.
      Special circumstances (such as a need for full hearing on request) may
      allow the Committee to extend the decision on such request, but the
      decision shall be rendered no later than one hundred twenty (120) days
      after receipt of the request for review.  Written notice of such an
      extension shall be furnished to the Participant or the Beneficiary prior
      to the commencement of the extension.  The decision of the Committee on
      review shall be set forth in writing and shall include specific reasons
      for the decision as well as specific references to the pertinent
      provisions of the Plan or Trust on which the decision is based.


SECTION 8.07  RECORDS AND REPORTS.

a.    The Committee shall be entitled to rely upon certificates, reports, and
      opinions provided by an accountant, tax or pension advisor, actuary or
      legal counsel employed by the Employer or Committee.  The Committee shall
      keep a record of all its proceedings and acts, and shall keep all such
      books of account, records, and other data as may be necessary for the
      proper administration of the Plan.  The regularly kept records of the
      Committee, the Employer, and the Trustee shall be conclusive evidence of
      the service of a Participant, such Participant's Compensation, age,
      marital status, status as an Employee, and all other matters contained
      therein and relevant to this Plan; provided, however, that a Participant
      may request a correction in the record of such Participant's age at any
      time prior to his retirement and such correction shall be made if within
      ninety (90) days after such request if the Participant furnishes a birth
      certificate, baptismal certificate, or other documentary proof of age
      satisfactory to the Committee in support of this correction.

b.    Each Participant and each Participant's designated Beneficiary must file
      with the Committee from time to time in writing a correct mailing address
      and each change of mailing address.  Any communication, statement, or
      notice addressed to a Participant or Beneficiary at the last mailing
      address filed with the Committee, or if no address is filed with the
      Committee, the last mailing address as shown on the Employer's records,
      will be binding on the Participant and Beneficiary for all purposes of
      the Plan.  Neither the Committee nor the Trustee shall be required to
      search for or locate a Participant or Beneficiary.





                                       42

SECTION 8.08  LIABILITY.

a.    A member of the Committee shall not be liable for any act, or failure to
      act, of any other member of the Committee, except to the extent that such
      member:

      1.      knowingly participates in, or undertakes to conceal, an act or
              omission of another Committee member, knowing that such act or
              omission is a breach of fiduciary duty to the Plan;

      2.      fails to comply with the specific responsibilities required as a
              member of the Committee, and such failure enables another member
              of the Committee to commit a breach of fiduciary duty to the
              Plan; or

      3.      has knowledge of a breach of fiduciary duty to the Plan by
              another member of the Committee, unless such member makes
              reasonable effort under the circumstances to remedy such breach.

b.    Each member of the Committee shall be liable with respect to his own acts
      of willful misconduct or gross negligence concerning the Plan.  The
      Employer shall indemnify the Committee or each of its members for part or
      all expenses, costs, or liabilities arising out of the performance of
      duties required by the terms of the Plan or Trust, except for those
      expenses, costs, or liabilities arising out of a member's willful
      misconduct or gross negligence.


SECTION 8.09  RELIANCE AND STATEMENTS.

The Committee, in any of its dealings with Participants hereunder, may
conclusively rely on any written statement, representation, or documents made
or provided by such Participants.


SECTION 8.10  REMUNERATION AND BONDING.

Unless otherwise determined by the Company, the members of the Committee shall
serve without remuneration for services to the Plan and Trust.  However, all
expenses of the Committee shall be paid by the Trust except to the extent paid
by the Employer.  Such expenses shall include any expenses incidental to the
functioning of the Committee, including but not limited to fees of accountants,
legal counsel, and other specialists, or any other costs entailed in
administering the Plan.  Title I of ERISA requires certain persons with
discretion over Plan assets to be bonded.  Except as required by ERISA or other
federal law, the members of the Committee shall serve without bond.

SECTION 8.11  COMMITTEE DECISIONS FINAL.

The decision of the Committee in matters within its jurisdiction shall be
final, binding, and conclusive upon the Employer and the Trustee and upon each
Employee, Participant, former Participant, Beneficiary, and every other person
or party interested or concerned.


                                   ARTICLE IX
                                TRUST AGREEMENT

SECTION 9.01  ESTABLISHMENT OF TRUST.

The Company and the Trustee hereby enter into a Trust Agreement which, except
to the extent such trust agreement is set forth in a valid separate and
distinct document, is incorporated herein and which establishes a trust
consisting of such sums of money and other property as may from time to time be
contributed or transferred to the Trustee under the terms of the Plan, along
with any property to which the Plan may from time to time convert, and which
provides for the investment of Plan assets and the operation of the Trust.
This Trust agreement, as amended from time to time, shall be deemed part of the
Plan, and all rights and benefits provided to persons under the Plan shall be
subject to the terms of the Trust agreement.  If the trust agreement between
the Company and the Trustee is set forth in a valid separate and distinct
document, the amendment and restatement of this Plan shall be executed only by
the Company and shall amend the terms of the Plan, but not any terms of the
existing trust agreement.


SECTION 9.02  CONTRIBUTIONS TO TRUSTEE.

The Trustee shall accept any cash, and may accept any other property tendered
to it as contributions hereunder, but shall not be under any duty to require
the Employer or any other person to contribute to the Trust Fund or to
determine whether the amount of any contribution has been correctly computed
under the terms of the Plan.


SECTION 9.03  PURPOSE OF THE TRUST.

The purpose of this Trust is to invest primarily in and hold Company Stock for
the benefit of Participants and the Beneficiaries of Participants.
Accordingly, the Committee shall direct the Trustee as to the portion of the
Trust Fund that shall be invested in Company Stock at any particular time.  As
directed by the Committee, the Trustee may also invest the Trust Fund in
property other than Company Stock.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Trustee shall keep sufficient liquid assets
on hand to pay the amounts attributable to fractional shares in accordance with
Article VI, and to pay cash distributions to those Participants who receive
cash distributions.  The Trust shall be a separate





                                       44
<PAGE>   51
entity from the Employer and its assets.  In no event shall the Trust Fund ever
be subject to the rights or claims of any creditor of the Employer.  Except as
provided in Section 9.01, it is expressly understood that the duties and
obligations of the Trustee shall be only those expressly stated in this Article
IX.


SECTION 9.04  DISTRIBUTIONS.

The Trustee shall from time to time make distributions from the Trust Fund to
such persons, in such amounts, and in such manner as the Committee may direct.
Instructions to the Trustee from the Committee need not specify the purpose of
the distributions so ordered, and the Trustee shall not be responsible in any
way for the propriety of such distributions or for the administration of the
Plan.  Any such instructions shall constitute a certification that each
distribution directed is one which the Committee is authorized to direct.  The
Trustee shall not be responsible for the adequacy of the Trust Fund to meet and
discharge any liabilities under the Plan.  If a dispute arises regarding who is
entitled to or should receive any distribution from the Trust Fund, the Trustee
may withhold, or cause the withholding of, such distribution until the dispute
has been resolved.


SECTION 9.05  EXCLUSIVE BENEFIT.

Except as the Committee may authorize the Trustee to return contributions to
the Employer pursuant to the terms of the Plan, no part of the Trust Fund shall
be used for or diverted to purposes other than for the exclusive benefit of
Participants and their Beneficiaries and for defraying expenses of the Plan and
Trust.

The Employer shall have no beneficial interest in the assets of the Trust, and
no part of the Trust shall ever revert to or be repaid to the Employer,
directly or indirectly, except that upon written request, the Employer shall
have a right to recover:

a.    a contribution to the Plan made by mistake of fact, if such contribution
      (to the extent made by mistake of fact) is returned to the Employer
      within one year after payment of such contribution;

b.    any contributions to the Plan conditioned upon initial qualification of
      the Plan under section 401(a) of the Code, if the Plan does not so
      qualify and such contributions are returned to the Employer within one
      year after the denial of qualification of the Plan and only, if a
      determination letter request is filed by the terms prescribed by law for
      filing the Employer's tax return for the taxable year in which the Plan
      is adopted;

c.    a contribution to the Plan, conditional on deductibility, which is
      disallowed as a deduction under section 404 of the Code, if such
      contribution (to the extent disallowed) is returned to the Employer
      within one year after the deduction is disallowed; and





                                       45
<PAGE>   52
d.    any residual assets due to a section 415 excess contribution upon
      termination of the Plan, if all liabilities of the Plan to Participants
      and their Beneficiaries have been satisfied and the reversion does not
      contravene any provision of law.


SECTION 9.06  EXPENSES OF THE PLAN AND TRUST.

All legal, administrative, taxes, and other expenses of the Plan and Trust and
the Trustee's fees (if any) shall be paid by the Trust, except to the extent
paid by the Employer.


SECTION 9.07  DUTIES AND RESPONSIBILITIES OF TRUSTEE.

It shall be the duty of the Trustee to hold, in trust, Company Stock, cash, and
other property from time to time received by it, and the Trustee shall have
authority to manage and control the assets of the Plan pursuant to the terms of
the Plan and this Trust, and subject to Section 4.07 of the Plan which permits
certain Participants to diversify the investment of certain of their Accounts.
The Trustee is to discharge such powers and duties solely in the interest of
the Participants and Beneficiaries for the exclusive purpose of providing
benefits to them, defraying reasonable expenses of administering the Plan, and
with the care, skill, prudence, and diligence under the circumstances then
prevailing that a prudent man acting in a like capacity and familiar with such
matters would use in the conduct of an enterprise of a like character and with
like aims.  Except as otherwise provided herein, the Trustee shall invest the
assets of the Trust Fund as directed by the Committee.  Since the Trustee is
directed by the Committee to invest the Trust Fund primarily in Company Stock,
the Trustee shall not have a duty to diversify the investments of such Accounts
to the extent such Accounts are invested in Company Stock.  To the extent the
Committee has not directed the Trustee as to the investment of the Trust Fund,
the Trustee shall diversify such investments so as to minimize the risk of
large losses, unless, under the circumstances, it is clearly prudent not to do
so, or to the extent the Trustee is directed as to the investment of the Trust
Fund by a Participant in accordance with Section 4.07 of the Plan.  Further,
the Trustee shall not make any investments or maintain the indicia of ownership
of any assets of the Plan outside the jurisdiction of the District Courts of
the United States.

Any cash received by the Trustee as Employer Contributions or as earnings on
the Trust Fund attributable to Unallocated Shares which is not applied to repay
a current obligation under any Acquisition Loan shall be held in the Loan
Suspense Account and either invested pursuant to Section 9.08, or used to
satisfy another obligation of the Plan.  Pending such investment or application
of cash, the Trustee may retain cash uninvested, without liability for interest
if it is prudent to do so.

The Trustee shall not knowingly cause the Plan to engage in any transaction
prohibited by section 4975 of the Code or by section 406 or 407(a) of ERISA in
the absence of an exception therefor.  The Trustee may hold, acquire, or invest
in qualifying employer securities as defined in section 407(d)(5) of ERISA or
qualifying employer real estate as defined in section





                                       46
<PAGE>   53
407(d)(4) of ERISA (or both) to the extent that the aggregate fair market value
of such securities and property does not exceed the limitations set forth in
section 407 of ERISA; provided, however, that all purchases of Company Stock
shall be for no more than, and for no less than, adequate consideration.  For
this purpose, "adequate consideration" means the fair market value, determined
in good faith by the Trustee.

The Company and each Employer shall indemnify the Trustee for all expenses,
costs, or liabilities arising out of the performances of its duties under the
Plan or Trust, except to the extent it is judicially determined that any such
expense, cost, or liability is due to the willful misconduct or gross
negligence of the Trustee.  The Trustee shall be protected in acting upon any
notice, direction, certificate, or other paper or document reasonably believed
by the Trustee to be genuine and to have been executed by a Participant, the
Plan Administrator, the Employer, a duly appointed Investment Manager or by a
duly authorized person or persons representing any of the foregoing.  During
any period of time that there is more than one Trustee, a Trustee shall not be
liable for any act or failure to act of any other Trustee, except to the extent
a Trustee (a) knowingly participates in, or undertakes to conceal, an act or
omission of another Trustee, knowing that such act or omission is a breach of
fiduciary duty to the Plan; (b) fails to comply with the specific
responsibilities required as a Trustee, and such failure enables another
Trustee to commit a breach of fiduciary duty to the Plan; or (c) has knowledge
of a breach of fiduciary duty to the Plan by another Trustee and does not make
reasonable effort under the circumstances to remedy such breach.


SECTION 9.08  SPECIFIC POWERS AND DUTIES OF TRUSTEE.

In addition to the powers and duties conferred upon it by other provisions of
the Plan and except to the extent inconsistent with applicable law or with
provisions of the Plan and Trust, the Trustee shall have the following powers
regarding the Trust and Trust Fund:

      considerations, in cash or in credit, and upon such terms and conditions,
      as it shall deem advisable.  In connection with the purchase of
      securities, margin accounts may be opened and maintained.  If put or call
      options are traded, they must be traded on and purchased through a
      national securities exchange registered under the Securities Act of 1934,
      as amended, or if the options are not traded on the national securities
      exchange, they must be guaranteed by a member firm of the New York Stock
      Exchange;

b.    to compromise or settle any claim in respect of any debt or other
      obligation due to it as Trustee hereunder, to institute and prosecute any
      and all legal proceedings (including foreclosure proceedings) on behalf

      such claim, and to change the rate of interest or extend the maturity
      date of any such debt or obligation;

      holders of any such securities; to participate in any such protective
      plan or agreement or any such reorganization to the same extent and as
      fully as though it was the absolute and individual owner of such
      securities; to deposit with any Committee or depositories pursuant to any
      such protective Plan or agreement or any such reorganization any
      securities held in the Trust Fund; to make payments from the Trust Fund

      plan or agreement on any such reorganization; and to receive and continue
      to hold in the Trust Fund any property allotted to the Trust Fund by
      reason of the Trustee's participation therein;

e.    to vote, in person or by general or limited proxy, on any securities at
      any time held in the Trust Fund, at any meeting of security holders, with

      necessary or appropriate therefore; and generally to exercise the powers

h.    to cause any property at any time held in the Trust Fund to be registered
      in the name of a nominee of the Trustee, without disclosure of the Trust,
      or to hold in bearer form any securities at any time held in the Trust
      Fund so that they will pass by delivery, but any such registration or
      holding by the Trustee shall not release it from its responsibility for
      the safe custody and disposition of the Trust Fund, in accordance with
      the terms and provisions of this agreement;

i.    to improve, develop, repair, maintain, preserve, and operate any property

<PAGE>   56
If there is more than one Trustee designated and acting under this Trust, all
actions by the Trustee must be adopted by a majority of the Trustees.


SECTION 9.09  INVESTMENT MANAGER.

Upon written notice to the Trustee and the Committee, the Company may appoint
one or more investment managers as described in section 3(38) of ERISA, which
shall have the power to manage, acquire, or dispose of all or part of the Trust
assets in accordance with the provisions of the Plan and Trust agreement.  The
Committee and investment manager shall execute a written agreement specifying
the Trust assets to be managed and the investment manager's duties and
responsibilities with respect to such assets, and in such agreement the
investment manager shall acknowledge that it is a fiduciary with respect to the
Plan and Trust.  The Committee may authorize the investment manager to give
written instructions to the Trustee with respect to acquiring, managing, and
disposing of assets managed by the investment manager, and the Trustee shall
follow such instructions and shall be under no duty to make an independent
determination regarding whether the instruction is proper.  The fees and
expenses of an investment manager shall be paid by the Trust, except to the
extent paid by the Employer.


SECTION 9.10  COMPENSATION OF TRUSTEE AND AGENTS.

The Trustee shall be entitled to reasonable compensation for its services.
Compensation shall be comparable to charges for similar services made from time
to time by other Trustees in the geographic area in which the Trustee has its
principal business.  Any Trustee shall be entitled to reimbursement for
expenses properly and actually incurred in the administration of the Trust.  It
may employ such agents, attorneys, accountants, or assistants as it may from
time to time deem necessary or advisable and fix the compensation to be paid to
them.  Such counsel or other agents may be counsel or other agents consulted or
employed by the Employer.  The expenses of the Trustee and the compensation of
the persons so employed shall be paid by the Trust Fund or the Employer, as the
Committee shall determine, on at least an annual basis.  An individual serving
as Trustee who already receives full-time pay from the Employer shall not
receive compensation from the Plan.


SECTION 9.11  REPORTS OF TRUSTEE.

The Trustee shall maintain records of receipts and disbursements and shall
render reports as of the close of each final year of the Trust and within
ninety (90) days following the resignation or removal of the Trustee shall file
with the Committee an account for such year such form and containing such
information as it deems necessary, provided that such information shall satisfy
all applicable requirements imposed by ERISA.  The records and accounts of the





                                       50
<PAGE>   57
Trustee may be audited annually by an independent firm of certified public
accountants selected by the Committee.


SECTION 9.12  RESIGNATION, REMOVAL, AND SUBSTITUTION OF TRUSTEE.

A Trustee may resign at any time upon sixty (60) days notice to the Employer.
A Trustee may be removed at any time by the Company upon sixty (60) days
written notice to the Trustee, with or without cause.  Upon resignation or
removal of the Trustee, the Committee shall appoint a successor Trustee which
shall have the same powers and duties as are conferred upon the Trustee
hereunder.  Upon the delivery by a predecessor Trustee to the successor Trustee
of all property of the Trust Fund, less such reasonable amount as it shall deem
necessary to provide for its expenses, compensation, and any taxes or advances
chargeable or payable out of the Trust Fund, the successor Trustee thereupon
shall have the same powers and duties as were conferred upon the predecessor
Trustee.  No successor Trustee shall have any obligation or liability with
respect to the acts or omissions of its predecessors.

In the event that a corporate Trustee merged or consolidated with another
corporation or sells or transfers substantially all of its assets and business
to another corporation, or is in any manner reorganized or reincorporated, then
the resulting or acquiring corporation shall thereupon become the corporate
Trustee hereunder without the execution of any instrument and without the need
for any action by the Committee, any Participant or Beneficiary, or any other
person having or claiming to have an interest in the Trust Fund or the Plan.

The Trustee shall be appointed by the Committee.  The appointment of a Trustee
shall become effective as of the date the Committee receives the Trust's
written acceptance of the appointment.  The Trustees' signature on the Plan
constitutes acceptance of the appointment.  The Committee shall appoint a new
Trustee, if the Trustee fails to accept its appointment in writing.



SECTION 9.13  THE COMMITTEE.

The Company shall certify to the Trustee from time to time the name(s) of the
person(s) constituting the Committee.  All directions to the Trustee by the
Committee shall be in writing, properly certified by a Committee member.  The
Trustee shall be entitled to rely, without further inquiry upon all such
written directions received from the Committee.


SECTION 9.14  AMENDMENT AND TERMINATION.

The Company shall have the right at any time, by an instrument in writing, duly
executed and acknowledged and delivered to the Trustee, to modify, alter or
amend this agreement, in whole or in part, and to terminate the Trust, in
accordance with the express provisions of the





                                       51
<PAGE>   58
Plan.  In no event, however, shall the duties, powers or liabilities of the
Trustee hereunder be changed without its written consent.

SECTION 9.15  IRREVOCABILITY.

Subject to the provisions of the Plan, the Trust is declared to be irrevocable,
and except as otherwise provided in Section 9.05, no part of the Trust Fund
shall revert to or be recoverable by the Employer or be used for or diverted to
any purposes other than for the exclusive benefit of Participants and
Beneficiaries.

The previous paragraph shall not apply to a "qualified domestic relations
order," as defined in section 414(p) of the Code, and any other domestic
relations order permitted to be so treated by the Trustee under the provisions
of the Retirement Equity Act of 1984.  The Committee shall establish a written
procedure to determine the qualified status of domestic relations orders and to
administer distributions under any domestic relations orders it determines to
be qualified.  To the extent provided under a "qualified domestic relations
order," a former Spouse of a Participant shall be treated as the Participant's
Spouse or Surviving Spouse for all purposes under the Plan.


SECTION 9.16  PARTIES TO THE TRUST AGREEMENT.

Any Employer which has adopted the Plan in accordance with the terms thereof
shall become a party to this agreement, by signing the Plan or upon delivering
a certified copy of a resolution to the effect that it agrees to adopt the
Plan, to become a party to this agreement, and to be bound by all terms and
conditions of the Plan and this agreement, as then in effect and as may
thereafter be amended.  The Committee shall have the sole authority to enforce
this agreement and the Trustee shall in no event be required to deal with any
person, except the Committee.  The Trustee shall in all respects invest and
administer the Trust Fund as a single fund for investment and accounting
purposes, without identification as to individual Participants, Beneficiaries,
or Employers.

An Employer shall cease to be a party to this agreement upon delivering to the
Trustee a certified copy of a resolution terminating its participation in the
Plan.  In such event, or in the event of the merger, consolidation, sale of
property or stock, separation, reorganization, or liquidation of any
corporation that is a party to this agreement, the Trustee, until directed
otherwise by the Committee, shall continue to hold, in accordance with the
provisions of this agreement, that portion of the Trust Fund which, pursuant to
the determination of the Committee, is attributable to the participation in the
Plan of the Employees and their Beneficiaries affected by such termination or
by such transaction.

SECTION 9.17  TRUSTEE ACTION.

If the Trustee consists of more than one person, the Trustees shall act by a
majority of their number.  The Trustees may authorize one or more specific
Trustees to sign papers on their behalf.


                                   ARTICLE X
                       AMENDMENT, TERMINATION, AND MERGER

SECTION 10.01  AMENDMENT.

The Company reserves the right to amend the Plan and Trust, by written
amendment and resolution of the Board of Directors of the Company, to the
extent permitted under the Code and ERISA.  No amendment affecting the rights
or duties of the Trustee shall be effective without the written consent of the
Trustees.  No amendment to the plan shall be effective to the extent that it
has the effect of decreasing a Participant's accrued benefit.  Notwithstanding
the preceding sentence, a Participant's Account balance may be reduced to the
extent permitted under section 412(c)(8) of the Code.  For purposes of this
paragraph, a plan amendment which has the effect of decreasing a Participant's
Account balance or eliminating an optional form of benefit, with respect to
benefits attributable to service before the amendment, shall be treated as
reducing an accrued benefit.


SECTION 10.02  TERMINATION.

a.    The Employer intends to continue the Plan indefinitely and to fund the
      Plan as required by law and its terms.  However, the Company reserves the
      right to terminate the Plan at any time.  If the Plan is totally or
      partially terminated, or in the event of a complete discontinuation of
      contributions under the Plan, a Participant whose participation in the
      Plan is terminated as a result of such total or partial termination or
      who is affected by the complete discontinuation of contributions to the
      Plan shall be one hundred percent (100%) Vested in such Participant's
      Accounts, determined as of the date of such total or partial termination.

b.    Upon termination of the Plan, the Employer shall allocate the assets of
      the Plan, after the payment of or set aside for the payment of all
      expenses, among the Participants and their Beneficiaries in accordance
      with the Code and ERISA.

c.    Upon termination of the Plan, and after all liabilities of the Plan to
      Participants and Beneficiaries have been satisfied, any residual assets
      of the Plan due to a section 415 excess contribution shall be distributed
      to the Employer, provided such distribution does not contravene any
      provision of the law or the Plan.





                                       53
<PAGE>   60
d.    The allocation of benefits under this Article X shall be accomplished
      either through the continuance of the Trust, the creation of a new Trust,
      the payment of the benefits to be provided to the Participants or
      Beneficiaries, or the purchase of annuity contracts, as determined by the
      Employer.


SECTION 10.03  MERGER, CONSOLIDATION, OR TRANSFER.

The Company shall have the right at any time to merge or consolidate the Plan
with any other Plan, or transfer the assets or liabilities of the Trust to any
other Plan provided each Participant would (if the Plan were then terminated)
receive a benefit immediately after such merger, consolidation or transfer
which would equal or exceed the benefit the Participant would have been
entitled to immediately before such merger, consolidation or transfer (if the
Plan were then terminated).


                                   ARTICLE XI
                              TOP-HEAVY PROVISIONS

SECTION 11.01  APPLICABILITY.

If the Plan is or becomes Top-Heavy in any Plan Year, the provisions of this
Article XI shall supersede any conflicting provisions in the Plan.


SECTION 11.02  TOP-HEAVY DEFINITIONS.

Throughout this Section 11.02, certain words and phrases have meanings which
are specifically defined for purposes of this Article XI of the Plan.  These
words and phrases can be identified in that the first letter of the word or
words in the phrase are capitalized.  The definitions of these words and
phrases are set forth below and, to the extent inconsistent, supersede the
definitions of any such words and phrases which are set forth in Article II, or
any other Article of the Plan.

a.    "Key Employee" means any Employee or former Employee (and the
      Beneficiaries of such Employee) who at any time during the "determination
      period" was (1) an officer of the Employer, if such individual's annual
      Compensation exceeds fifty percent (50%) of the dollar limitation under
      section 415(b)(1)(A) of the Code; (2) an owner (or considered an owner
      under section 318 of the Code) of one of the ten largest interests in the
      Employer if such individual's Compensation exceeds one hundred percent
      (100%) of the dollar limitation under section 415(c)(1)(A) of the Code;
      (3) a five percent (5%) owner of the Employer; or (4) a one percent (1%)
      owner of the Employer who has an annual Compensation of more than
      $150,000.  Compensation means Compensation as defined in section
      415(c)(3) of the Code, but including amounts contributed by the Employer
      pursuant to a salary reduction agreement which are





                                       54
<PAGE>   61
      excludable from the Employee's gross income under sections 125,
      402(e)(3), 402(h) or 403(b) of the Code.  The "determination period" is
      the Plan Year containing the Determination Date and the four preceding
      Plan Years.  The determination of who is a Key Employee will be made in
      accordance with section 416(i)(1) of the Code and the Regulations
      thereunder.

b.    "Top-Heavy Plan" means, for the Plan Year, any of the following
      conditions exists:

      1.      If the Top-Heavy Ratio for this Plan exceeds sixty percent (60%)
              and this Plan is not part of any Required Aggregation Group or
              Permissive Aggregation Group of plans.

      2.      If this Plan is a part of a Required Aggregation Group of plans,
              but not part of a Permissive Aggregation Group of plans and the
              Top-Heavy Ratio for the Required Aggregation Group exceeds sixty
              percent (60%).

      3.      If this plan is a part of a Required Aggregation Group and part
              of a Permissive Aggregation Group of plans and the Top-Heavy
              Ratio for the Permissive Aggregation Group exceeds sixty percent
              (60%).

c.    "Super-Top-Heavy Plan" means, for the Plan Year, the Plan would be
      Top-Heavy when "ninety percent (90%)" is substituted for "sixty percent
      (60%)" each place it appears in (b) above.

d.    "Top-Heavy Ratio" means the following:

      1.      If the Employer maintains one or more Defined Contribution Plans
              (including any simplified employee pension plan) and the Employer
              has not maintained any Defined Benefit Plan which during the five
              (5) year period ending on the Determination Date(s) has or has
              had accrued benefits, the Top-Heavy ratio for this Plan alone or
              for the required or Permissive Aggregation Group, as appropriate,
              is a fraction, the numerator of which is the sum of the Account
              balances of all Key Employees as of the Determination Date(s)
              (including any part of any Account balance distributed in the
              five (5) year period ending on the Determination Date(s)), and
              the denominator of which is the sum of all Account balances
              (including any part of any Account balance distributed in the
              five (5) year period ending on the Determination Date(s)), both
              computed in accordance with section 416 of the Code and the
              Regulations thereunder.  Both the numerator and denominator of
              the Top-Heavy Ratio are increased to reflect any contribution not
              actually made as of the Determination Date, but which is required
              to be taken into account on that date under section 416 of the
              Code and the Regulations thereunder.





                                       55
<PAGE>   62
      2.      If the Employer maintains one or more Defined Contribution Plans
              (including any simplified employee pension plan) and the Employer
              maintains or has maintained one or more Defined Benefit Plans
              which during the five (5) year period ending on the Determination
              Date(s) has or has had any accrued benefits, the Top-Heavy Ratio
              for any required or Permissive Aggregation Group, as appropriate,
              is a fraction, the numerator of which is the sum of Account
              balances under the aggregated Defined Contribution Plan or Plans
              for all Key Employees, determined in accordance with (1) above,
              and the Present Value of accrued benefits under the aggregated
              Defined Benefit Plan or Plans for all Key Employees as of the
              Determination Date(s), and the denominator of which is the sum of
              the Account balances under the aggregated Defined Contribution
              Plan or Plans for all Participants, determined in accordance with
              (1) above, and the Present Value of accrued benefits under the
              Defined Benefit Plan or Plans for all Participants as of the
              Determination Date(s), as determined in accordance with section
              416 of the Code and the Regulations thereunder.  The accrued
              benefits under a Defined Benefit Plan in both the numerator and
              denominator of the Top-Heavy Ratio are increased for any
              distribution of an accrued benefit made in the five (5) year
              period ending on the Determination Date.

      3.      For purposes of (1) and (2) above, the value of Account balances
              and the Present Value of accrued benefits shall be determined as
              of the most recent Valuation Date that falls within or ends with
              the twelve (12) month period ending on the Determination Date,
              except as provided in section 416 of the Code and the Regulations
              thereunder for the first and second Plan Years of a Defined
              Benefit Plan.  The Account balances and accrued benefits of a
              Participant (a) who is not a Key Employee, but who was a Key
              Employee in a prior year, or (b) who has not been credited with
              at least one Hour of Service with any Employer maintaining the
              Plan at any time during the five-year period ending on the
              Determination Date will be disregarded.  The calculation of the
              Top-Heavy Ratio, and the extent to which distributions, rollovers
              and transfers are taken into account will be made in accordance
              with section 416 of the Code and the Regulations thereunder.
              Deductible Employee contributions will not be taken into account
              for purposes of computing the Top-Heavy Ratio.  When aggregating
              plans the value of Account balances and accrued benefits will be
              calculated with reference to the Determination Dates that fall
              within the same calendar year.

              The accrued benefit of a Participant other than a Key Employee
              shall be determined under either; (a) the method, if any, that
              uniformly applies for accrual purposes under all Defined Benefit
              Plans maintained by the Employer; or (b) if there is no such
              method, as if such benefit accrued not more rapidly than the
              slowest accrual rate permitted under the fractional rule of
              section 411(b)(1)(C) of the Code.





                                       56
<PAGE>   63
e.    "Permissive Aggregation Group" means the Required Aggregation Group of
      plans plus any other plan or plans of the Employer which, when considered
      as a group with the Required Aggregation Group, would continue to satisfy
      the requirements of sections 401(a)(4) and 410 of the Code.

f.    "Required Aggregation Group" means:  (1) each qualified plan of the
      Employer in which at least one Key Employee participates or participated
      at any time during the determination period (regardless of whether the
      Plan has terminated); and (2) any other qualified plan of the Employer
      which enables a plan described in (1) to meet the requirements of
      sections 401(a)(4) or 410 of the Code.

g.    "Determination Date" means for any Plan Year subsequent to the first Plan
      Year, the last day of the preceding Plan Year.  For the first Plan Year
      of the Plan, the last day of that year.

h.    "Valuation Date" means the date as defined in Article II as of which
      Account balances or accrued benefits are valued for purposes of
      calculating the Top-Heavy Ratio.

i.    "Present Value" means amounts determined by using the interest and
      mortality rates specified in the applicable plans.  Notwithstanding the
      foregoing, all determinations shall be made in accordance with section
      416 of the Code and the Regulations thereunder.


SECTION 11.03  MINIMUM ALLOCATION.

a.    Except as otherwise provided in (c) and (d) below, the Employer
      Contributions and Forfeitures allocated on behalf of any Participant who
      is not a Key Employee shall not be less than the lesser of three percent
      (3%) (four percent (4%), if the Plan is Super-Top-Heavy) of such
      Participant's Compensation or in the case where the Employer has no
      Defined Benefit Plan which designates this Plan to satisfy section 401 of
      the Code, the largest percentage of Employer Contributions and
      Forfeitures, as a percentage of the Key Employee's Compensation,
      allocated on behalf of any Key Employee for that year.  The minimum
      allocation is determined without regard to any Social Security
      contribution.

b.    For purposes of computing the minimum allocation, Compensation means
      Compensation as defined in Article II.

c.    The provision in (a) above shall not apply to any Participant who was not
      employed by the Employer on the last day of the Plan Year.

d.    The provision in (a) above shall not apply to any Participant to the
      extent the Participant is covered under any other plan or plans of the
      Employer and the minimum





                                       57
<PAGE>   64
      allocation or benefit requirement applicable to Top-Heavy Plans will be
      met in the other plan or plans.


SECTION 11.04  NONFORFEITABILITY OF MINIMUM ALLOCATION.

The minimum allocation required (to the extent required to be nonforfeitable
under section 416(b)) may not be forfeited pursuant to section 411(a)(3)(D) of
the Code.


SECTION 11.05  ALLOCATION LIMITATIONS.

In determining the Defined Contribution Fraction under section 415(e)(3)(B) of
the Code and pursuant to Section 5.03, "one hundred percent (100%)" shall be
substituted for "one hundred twenty-five percent (125%)," unless the minimum
allocation percentage under section 416(c)(2)(A) of the Code and Section
11.03(a) of the Plan is increased from "three percent (3%)" to "four percent
(4%)" and the Plan is a Super-Top-Heavy Plan.

SECTION 11.06  TOP-HEAVY VESTING.

a.    For any Plan Year during which the Plan is Top-Heavy, the vesting
      schedule below will automatically apply to all benefits within the
      meaning of section 411(a)(7) of the Code, except those attributable to
      Employee contributions, including benefits accrued before the effective
      date of section 416 and benefits accrued before the Plan became
      Top-Heavy.  Further, no decrease in a Participant's nonforfeitable
      percentage may occur in the event the Plan's status as Top-Heavy changes
      for any Plan Year.  However, this Section 11.06 does not apply to the
      Account balance(s) of any Employee who does not have an Hour of Service
      after the Plan has initially become Top-Heavy.  Such Employee's Account
      balance attributable to Employer contributions and Forfeitures will be
      determined without regard to the Section 11.06.

b.    The nonforfeitable interest of each Employee in his or her Account
      balance attributable to Employer contributions shall be as follows:

c.    If the vesting schedule under the Plan becomes subject to or is no longer
      subject to the above schedule for any Plan Year, because of the Plan's
      Top-Heavy status, such shift is an amendment to the vesting schedule and
      the election provided in Section 5.10(g) of the Plan shall be available.


                                  ARTICLE XII
                               GENERAL PROVISIONS

SECTION 12.01  GOVERNING LAW.

The Plan and Trust are established under, and its validity, construction and
effect shall be governed by the laws of the State of Texas.  The parties to the
Trust intend that the Trust be exempt from taxation under section 501(a) of the
Code, and any ambiguities in its construction shall be resolved in favor of an
interpretation which will affect such intention.


SECTION 12.02  POWER TO ENFORCE.

The Committee shall have authority to enforce the Plan on behalf of any and all
persons having or claiming any interest in the Trust or Plan.


SECTION 12.03  ALIENATION OF BENEFITS.

Benefits under the Plan shall not be subject to anticipation, alienation, sale,
transfer, assignment, pledge, encumbrance, or charge and any attempt to
anticipate, alienate, sell, transfer, assign, pledge, encumber, or charge the
same shall be void, nor shall any such benefits be in any way liable for or
subject to the debts, contracts, liabilities, engagements, or torts of any
person entitled to such benefits.  This Section 12.03 shall also apply to the
creation, assignment, or recognition of a right to any benefit payable with
respect to a Participant pursuant to a domestic relations order, unless such
order is determined to be a "qualified domestic relations order" as defined in
section 414(p) of the Code, or any domestic relations order entered before
January 1, 1985.


SECTION 12.04  NOT AN EMPLOYMENT CONTRACT.

The Plan is not and shall not be deemed to constitute a contract between the
Employer and any Employees, or to be a consideration for, or an inducement to,
or a condition of, the employment of any Employee.  Nothing contained in the
Plan shall give or be deemed to give an Employee the right to remain in the
employment of the Employer or to interfere with the right to be retained in the
employ of the Employer any legal or equitable right against the Employer, or to
interfere with the right of the Employer to discharge or retire any Employee at
any time.

<PAGE>   66
SECTION 12.05  DISCRETIONARY ACTS.

Any discretionary acts to be taken under the Plan with respect to the
classification of Employees, contributions, or benefits shall be
nondiscriminatory and uniform in nature and applicable to all persons similarly
situated.


SECTION 12.06  INTERPRETATION.

If any provision or provisions of the Plan shall for any reason be invalid or
unenforceable, the remaining provisions of the Plan shall be carried into
effect, unless the effect thereof would be to materially alter or defeat the
purposes of the Plan.  All terms of the Plan and all discretion granted
hereunder shall be uniformly and consistently applied to all the Employees,
Participants, and Beneficiaries.


                                  ARTICLE XIII
                            PARTICIPATING EMPLOYERS

SECTION 13.01  ADOPTION BY OTHER EMPLOYERS.

Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, with the consent of the
Company, any Affiliate may adopt this Plan and all of the provisions hereof,
and participate herein and be known as a participating Employer, by a properly
executed document evidencing said intent and will of such participating
Employer.


SECTION 13.02  REQUIREMENTS OF PARTICIPATING EMPLOYERS.

a.    Each such participating Employer shall be required to use the same
      Trustee as provided in the Plan.

b.    The Trustee may, but shall not be required to, co-mingle, hold and invest
      as one Trust Fund all contributions made by participating Employers, as
      well as all increments thereof.  However, the assets of the Plan shall,
      on an ongoing basis, be available to pay benefits to all Participants and
      Beneficiaries under the Plan without regard to the Employer or
      participating Employer who contributed such assets.

c.    The transfer of any Participant from or to an Employer participating in
      the Plan, whether such Participant is an Employee of the Company or a
      participating Employer, shall not affect such Participant's rights under
      the Plan, and all amounts credited to such Participant's Account as well
      as such Participant's accumulated service time with





                                       60
<PAGE>   67
      the transferor or predecessor, and length of participation in the Plan,
      shall continue to accrue to such Participant's credit.

d.    Any expenses of the Trust which are to be paid by the Employer or borne
      by the Trust Fund shall be paid by each Participating Employer in the
      same proportion that the total amount standing to the credit of all
      Participants employed by such Employer bears to the total standing to the
      credit of all Participants.


SECTION 13.03  DESIGNATION OF AGENT.

Each participating Employer shall be deemed to be a part of this Plan;
provided, however, that with respect to all of its relations with the Trustee
and the Committee for the purpose of this Plan, each participating Employer
shall be deemed to have designated irrevocably the Company as its agent.
Unless the context of the Plan clearly indicates the contrary, the word
"Employer" shall be deemed to include each participating Employer as related to
its adoption of the Plan.


SECTION 13.04  PARTICIPATING EMPLOYER'S CONTRIBUTION.

Any contribution subject to allocation during each Plan Year shall be allocated
among all Participants of all participating Employers in accordance with the
provisions of this Plan.  On the basis of the information furnished by the
Committee, the Trustee shall keep separate books and records concerning the
affairs of each Employer.  In the event of an Employee transfer from one
participating Employer to another, the employing Employer shall immediately
notify the Trustee thereof.


SECTION 13.05  DISCONTINUANCE OF PARTICIPATION.

Any participating Employer shall be permitted to discontinue or revoke its
participation in the Plan, and the Committee may terminate the participation of
any participating Employer.  At the time of any such discontinuance or
revocation, satisfactory evidence thereof and of any applicable condition
imposed shall be delivered to the Committee.  Termination of a participating
Employer's participation by the Committee shall be effected by written notice
to the participating Employer when the Committee deems it appropriate, the
Committee shall direct the Trustee thereafter to transfer, deliver, and assign
Trust assets allocable to the Participants of such participating Employer to
such new Trustee as shall have been designated by such participating Employer,
in the event that it has established a separate plan for its Employees
provided, however, that no such transfer shall be made, if the result is the
elimination or reduction of any "accrued benefit" as described in Section
10.01.  If no successor is designated, the Trustee shall retain such assets for
the Employees of said participating Employer pursuant to the provisions of
Article X.  In no such event shall any part of the corpus or income of the
Trust, as it relates to such participating Employer be used or

diverted for purposes other than for the exclusive benefit of the Employees of
such participating Employer.


SECTION 13.06  COMMITTEE'S AUTHORITY.

The Committee shall have authority to make any and all necessary rules or
regulations, binding upon all participating Employers and all Participants, to
effectuate the purpose of this Article XIV.
