PART I.


ITEM 1.   BUSINESS.

      The Registrant, Dean Witter Realty Income Partnership I, L.P. (the
"Partnership"), is a limited partnership formed in August 1983 under
the Uniform Limited Partnership Act of the State of Delaware for the
purpose of investing primarily in income-producing office, industrial
and retail properties.  

      The Managing General Partner of the Partnership is Dean Witter
Realty Income Properties I Inc. (the "Managing General Partner"), a
Delaware corporation which is wholly owned by Dean Witter Realty Inc.
("Realty").  The Associate General Partner is Dean Witter Realty Income
Associates I, L.P. (the "Associate General Partner"), a Delaware
limited partnership, the general partner of which is Dean Witter Realty
Income Associates I Inc., a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Managing
General Partner.  The Managing General Partner manages and controls all
aspects of the business of the Partnership.  The terms of transactions
between the Partnership and its affiliates are set forth below in
footnote 8 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 and in
Item 13.

      The Partnership issued 92,780 units of limited partnership
interest (the "Units") with gross proceeds from the offering of
$92,780,000.  The offering has been terminated and no additional Units
will be sold.

      The proceeds from the offering were used to make equity
investments in four office properties, two office/research and
development properties and one retail property which were acquired
without mortgage debt.  The properties are described in Item 2 below.

      The Partnership considers its business to include one industry
segment, investment in real property.  Financial information regarding
the Partnership is included in the Partnership's Financial Statements
in Item 8 below.

      The Partnership's real property investments are subject to
competition from similar types of properties in the vicinities in which
they are located.  Further information regarding competition and market
conditions where the Partnership's properties are located is set forth
in Item 7, "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition
and Results of Operations."

      The Partnership has no employees.

      All of the Partnership's business is conducted in the United
States.



<TABLE>
ITEM 2.   PROPERTIES.

      The Partnership's principal offices are located at Two World Trade
Center, New York, New York 10048.  The Partnership has no other
offices.

      The Partnership owns directly or through a partnership interest
the following seven property interests, none of which is encumbered by
mortgage debt.  Generally, the leases pertaining to the properties
provide for pass-throughs to the tenants of their pro-rata share of
certain operating expenses.  In the opinion of the Managing General
Partner, all of the properties are adequately covered by insurance.

            Further information relating to the Partnership's properties
is included in Item 7 and footnotes 4 and 5 to the consolidated
financial statements in Item 8 below.

ITEM 3.     LEGAL PROCEEDINGS.

On December 27, 1995, a class action lawsuit naming various public real
estate partnerships sponsored by Realty (including the Partnership and
its Managing General Partner and Associate General Partner), Realty,
Dean Witter Reynolds Inc. and others as defendants was filed in
Superior Court in California.  The complaint alleges fraud, negligent
misrepresentation, intentional and negligent breach of fiduciary duty,
unjust enrichment and related claims and seeks compensatory and
punitive damages in unspecified amounts and injunctive and other
equitable relief.  The defendants have removed the case to the United
States District Court for the Southern District of California.  The
defendants have not yet responded to the complaint.  The defendants
intend to vigorously defend the action.

ITEM 4.     SUBMISSION OF MATTERS TO A VOTE OF SECURITY HOLDERS.

            No matter was submitted during the fourth quarter of the
fiscal year to a vote of Unit holders.

                                           PART II.

ITEM 5.     MARKET FOR THE REGISTRANT'S COMMON EQUITY AND RELATED              
            STOCKHOLDER MATTERS.

            An established public trading market for the Units does not
exist, and it is not anticipated that such a market will develop in the
future.  Accordingly, information as to the market value of a Unit at
any given date is not available.  However, the Partnership does allow
its limited partners (the "Limited Partners") to transfer their units
if a suitable buyer can be located.

            As of January 25, 1996 there were 14,898 holders of limited
partnership interests.

            The Partnership is a limited partnership and, accordingly,
does not pay dividends.  It does, however, make quarterly distributions
of cash to its partners.  Pursuant to the partnership agreement,
distributable cash, as defined, is paid 90% to the Limited Partners and
10% to the general partners (the "General Partners").  

            The Partnership paid quarterly cash distributions during the
year ended October 31, 1995 aggregating $18.75 per Unit to the Limited
Partners.  The total distribution aggregated $1,932,915 with $1,739,625
distributed to the Limited Partners and $193,290 to the General
Partners.  For the year ended October 31, 1994, the Partnership paid
quarterly cash distributions aggregating $15.00 per Unit to the Limited
Partners.  The total distribution aggregated $1,546,333 with $1,391,700
distributed to the Limited Partners and $154,633 due to the General
Partners.

            On November 28, 1995, the Partnership paid a cash distribution
of $5.00 per Unit to Limited Partners.  The total distribution
aggregated $515,444 with $463,900 of cash distributed to the Limited
Partners and $51,544 due to the General Partners.  

            The Partnership anticipates making regular distributions to
its partners in the future.

            Sale or financing proceeds will be distributed, to the extent
available, first, to each Limited Partner, until there has been a
return of the Limited Partner's capital contribution plus cumulative
distributions of distributable cash and sale or financing proceeds in
an amount sufficient to provide a 9% cumulative annual return on the
Limited Partner's adjusted capital contribution.  Thereafter, any
remaining sale or financing proceeds will be distributed 85% to the
Limited Partners and 15% to the General Partners after the Managing
General Partner receives a brokerage fee of up to 3% of the selling
price of any equity investment.

            Taxable income generally will be allocated in the same
proportions as distributions of distributable cash or sale or financing
proceeds (except that the General Partners must be allocated at least
1% of taxable income from sales or financings).  In the event there is
no distributable cash or sale or financing proceeds, taxable income
will be allocated 90% to the Limited Partners and 10% to the General
Partners.  Any tax loss will be allocated 90% to the Limited Partners
and 10% to the General Partners.

ITEM 7.      MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND
             RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.

             Liquidity and Capital Resources

     The Partnership raised $92,780,000 in a public offering which was
terminated in 1984.  The Partnership has no plans to raise additional
capital.

     The Partnership has purchased six properties and has made one
investment in a partnership on an all-cash basis.  The Partnership's
acquisition program has been completed.  No additional investments are
planned.

     The condition of the real estate market varies among different
regions of the country and by property type.  The relative absence of
office construction as well as growth in business services has resulted
in absorption of office space in cities such as Boston, Charlotte and
suburban Chicago (locations of Westwood 10, Carmel Park, and Arlington
Business Center, respectively). In contrast, office vacancy levels in
southern California (locations of Harborgate and Century Square) remain
essentially unchanged from the prior year as certain large corporations
and financial companies continue to restructure and consolidate their
operations.  In most markets, office construction is limited to build-
to-suit projects.  Office/research and development properties in
certain regions are benefiting from growth in the computer,
communications and electronics industries.  At retail properties, the
demand for space for the first half of 1995 was subdued as a result of
generally sluggish retail sales and competition from large power
centers, discounters and reorganized department stores.  

     The Partnership's liquidity depends on the cash flow from
operations of its properties and expenditures for tenant improvements
and leasing commissions in connection with the leasing of space. In
1995 all of the Partnership's properties generated positive cash flow
from operations, and it is anticipated that they will continue to do
so.

     In 1995, Partnership cash flow from operations and distributions
received from its joint venture investment exceeded distributions to
investors and capital expenditures.  The Partnership expects that such
cash inflows will be sufficient to fund capital expenditures and
distributions to investors in 1996.  The Partnership increased the cash
distribution rate from 1.5% to 2% per Unit beginning with the cash
distribution for the first fiscal quarter of 1995 which were paid in
February 1995.  In addition, beginning with that distribution, the
General Partners no longer defer their share of cash distributions.

     In 1995, the Partnership incurred approximately $782,000 of tenant
improvements and leasing commissions, of which approximately $480,000
was related to the Westwood 10 property, and approximately $141,000 was
related to the Carmel Park I and II properties.  The Partnership also
contributed approximately $388,000 to the Century Square joint venture,
primarily for its share of leasing commissions in connection with the
new Countrywide lease described below.

     Effective January 1, 1995, the lease term of Countrywide Credit
Industries, Inc., the largest tenant at the Century Square office
building, was extended from March 2000 to March 2010.  The rental rate
will remain at the 1994 rate through 2004, rather than increasing, as
provided for under the original leases.  After 2004, rents will
increase ten percent for the remainder of the lease term.  The
restructured lease is expected to result in stable cash flow from the
property for a total of fifteen years, at a higher level than
comparable current market rents.  Given the current market and economic
conditions in Pasadena, CA, and the credit-worthiness of Countrywide,
the Managing General Partner considers the terms of the new agreement
favorable.  

     Prior to 1990, the Partnership had borrowed funds from an affiliate
of the Managing General Partner to fund tenant improvements, capital
expenditures and other partnership expenditures.  As of October 31,
1995, $4,032,527 was outstanding on this loan.  The loan bears interest
at the prime rate (8.75% as of October 31, 1995).  Interest expense on
the affiliate loan amounted to $342,221, $281,361 and $287,091 for the
years ended October 31, 1995, 1994 and 1993, respectively.  

     On November 28, 1995 the Partnership paid the fourth quarter cash
distribution of $5.00 per Unit to Limited Partners.  The total
distribution aggregated $515,444 with $463,900 of cash distributed to
the Limited Partners and $51,544 to the General Partners.   

     Except as described above and in the consolidated financial
statements, the Managing General Partner is not aware of any trends or
events, commitments or uncertainties that will impact liquidity in a
material way.

     Operations

     Fluctuations in the Partnership's operating results for the year
ended October 31, 1995 compared to 1994 and for the year ended October
31, 1994 compared to 1993 are primarily attributable to the following:

     The slight decrease in rental revenue in 1995 compared to 1994
resulted primarily from lower rental revenue on new leases at the
Arlington Business Center offset by increases in rent resulting from
increased occupancy at the Westwood 10 property.  The increase in
rental revenue in 1994 compared to 1993 was primarily attributable to
increased average occupancy levels at 1718 Connecticut and Westwood 10
during 1994.  As described earlier, the lease rate for Countrywide
Credit, the largest tenant at the Century Square property, will remain
level through 2004.
     
     The increase in interest and other revenue in 1995 compared to 1994
is primarily due to tenant reimbursements at Arlington.  Interest
income also increased because of increases in the amount of funds
invested as well as increases in interest rates.  The decrease in 1994
compared to 1993 is primarily due to the receipt of lease termination
fees in 1993 of $52,500 from a tenant at the Arlington Business Center
and $160,000 from another tenant at Carmel Park I.  This decrease was
partially offset by an increase in interest income resulting from
greater funds invested in short-term investments as well as an increase
in interest rates.

     The decrease in property operating expenses for the year ended 1995
when compared to 1994 is primarily due to real estate tax refunds at
the 1718 Connecticut and Harborgate properties.  The increase in
operating expense in 1994 compared to 1993 is primarily attributable
to increases in real estate taxes in 1994 at Arlington Business Center
as a result of an increase in the assessed value of the property and
at Harborgate because of the absence of a refund which had been
received in 1993.  These increases were partially offset by a real
estate tax refund received at Westwood 10 in 1994.  

     The decreases in depreciation and amortization for the year ended
1995 compared to 1994 are due to the lower depreciable basis of the
Harborgate office building and Arlington Business Center properties,
as a result of writedowns recorded in October 1994.  The increases in
depreciation and amortization in 1994 compared to 1993 correspond to
increased expenditures for tenant improvement and leasing commissions
in 1994.

     The decrease in general and administrative expense in 1994 as
compared to 1993 is primarily due to decreased legal fees in 1994.

     In fiscal 1994, the Partnership recorded losses on impairment of
the Harborgate and Arlington Business Center properties.  See Note 4
to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8.

     A summary of the office, retail and research and development
building markets where the Partnership's properties are located and the
performance of each property is as follows:

     In Pasadena, California, the location of the Century Square office
building, the overall office market vacancy rate is approximately 15%,
and it is expected to remain at approximately the same level as there
has been a noticeable lack of movement in that market.  However,
Century Square remained 100% leased during the year.  The property's
largest tenant, Countrywide Credit, occupied 84% of the properties
rentable space.  No leases are due to expire in 1996.

     The Los Angeles, California office market, the location of
Harborgate, is weak primarily as a result of cuts in the defense and
aerospace industries.  The vacancy rate (including sublet space) in
this market has increased to approximately 29%.  Although the property
is well located within this market, there are limited number of tenants
seeking to lease space in this area.  Reduced tenant demand, an
oversupply of available space and competition from surrounding office
markets impedes improvement in this market.  At October 31, 1995,
occupancy at the property was 84%.  The property is leased to 10
tenants.  The lease to U.S. Sprint Communications, which occupies
approximately 52% of the property's net rentable space, was renewed
until October 31, 2000 subject to certain termination rights.  Included
in the U.S. Sprint lease renewal are tenant improvement costs
approximating $490,000 to be spent by the Partnership over the next two
to three years.  Lease expirations in 1996 total 9.8% of the total
rentable space.

     Arlington Business Center, a research and development building is
located in Arlington Heights, Illinois.  An improved midwest economy
and the absence of office construction during the past few years have
reduced office vacancy levels in this suburban Chicago market.  The
vacancy rate in this market is approximately 17%.  However, as of
October 31, 1995, occupancy at the property was 95%.  The property is
leased to 8 tenants.  Tenants occupying more than 10% of rentable space
are Racal Data Communications, CTC International, Inc., Digital
Equipment, Electronic Prepress and Pitney Bowes.  Digital Equipment
lease was due to expire in 1996, but Digital renewed for five years. 
No other leases expire in 1996.  

     Westwood 10, located in Westwood, Massachusetts, has recently
experienced some easing of the oversupply of research and development
buildings. The vacancy rate in this market is approximately 22%.  As
of October 31, 1995, the property was 85% leased to 6 tenants.  Tenants
occupying more than 10% of rentable space are Executone Information
Systems, Mobile Media X-Ray, and Mitek Surgical Products.  Leases
totaling 3.3% of rental space expire in 1996.

     The Washington D.C., office market in which 1718 Connecticut is
located has a vacancy rate of approximately 12%.  As of October 31,
1995, occupancy at the property was 100%.  The property is leased to
9 tenants.  Tenants occupying more than 10% of rentable space are
Policy Studies Association, Island Press, Embassy of Argentina,
Association of American Publishers, and the Door Store.  No leases
expire in 1996.  

     The Charlotte, North Carolina office market, in which Carmel Park
is located, has a vacancy rate of approximately 4%.  In this market,
there is little new construction and rental rates have increased
slightly.  Carmel Park's occupancy was 98% as of October 31, 1995.  The
property is leased to 18 tenants.  Tenants occupying more than 10% of
rentable space are CIGNA and Royal Indemnity.  Leases totaling less
than 1% of rental space expire in 1996.

     Altamonte Springs, Florida, the location of the North Lake Plaza
Shopping Center, is a difficult retail market where overbuilding has
exerted downward pressure on rents and the market vacancy rate is
approximately 20%.  Occupancy at the property as of October 31, 1995
was 91%.  The property was leased to 13 tenants as of October 31, 1995. 
Tenants occupying more than 10% of rentable space are Marshalls and
Burlington Coat Factory.  In March 1992, Home Depot sub-leased its 
space to Burlington Coat Factory for the remainder of the lease term. 
Home Depot will remain obligated to pay rent under its lease until the
lease expires.  No leases expire in 1996.

     Inflation

     Inflation has been consistently low during the periods presented
in the financial statements and, as a result, has not had a significant
effect on the operations of the Partnership or its properties.

Independent Auditors' Report





To The Partners of
Dean Witter Realty Income Partnership I, L.P.:


We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Dean
Witter Realty Income Partnership I, L.P. and consolidated partnerships
(the "Partnership") as of October 31, 1995 and 1994, and the related
consolidated statements of operations, partners' capital, and cash
flows for each of the three years in the period ended October 31, 1995. 
Our audits also included the financial statement schedule listed in the
Index at Item 8.  These financial statements and financial statement
schedule are the responsibility of the Partnership's management.  Our
responsibility is to express an opinion on the financial statements and
the financial statement schedule based on our audits.

We conducted our audits in accordance with generally accepted auditing
standards.  Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit
to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements
are free of material misstatement.  An audit includes examining, on a
test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the
financial statements.  An audit also includes assessing the accounting
principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well
as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation.  We believe
that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.

In our opinion, such financial statements present fairly in all
material respects, the financial position of Dean Witter Realty Income
Partnership I, L.P. and consolidated partnerships as of October 31,
1995 and 1994, and the results of their operations and their cash flows
for each of the three years in the period ended October 31, 1995 in
conformity with generally accepted accounting principles.  Also, in our
opinion, such financial statement schedule, when considered in relation
to the basic consolidated financial statements taken as a whole,
presents fairly in all material respects the information set forth
therein.

1.    The Partnership

Dean Witter Realty Income Partnership I, L.P. (the "Partnership") is
a limited partnership organized under the laws of the State of Delaware
in 1983.  The Partnership is managed by Dean Witter Realty Income
Properties I Inc. (the "Managing General Partner").  The Partnership's
fiscal year ends on October 31.

In 1984, the Partnership issued 92,780 units of limited partnership
interest (the "Units") for $92,780,000.  No additional Units will be
sold.  The proceeds of the offering were used to make equity
investments in income-producing office, industrial and retail
properties which were not encumbered by debt when acquired.

2.    Summary of Significant Accounting Policies

The financial statements include the accounts of the Partnership and
1718 Connecticut, Ltd. on a consolidated basis.  The Partnership's 25%
interest in the Century Square property is accounted for on the equity
method.

The Partnership's records are maintained on the accrual basis of
accounting for financial reporting and tax purposes.  The preparation
of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted
accounting principles requires management to make estimates and
assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities
and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the
financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses
during the reporting period.  Actual results could differ from those
estimates.

The carrying value of real estate includes the purchase price paid by
the Partnership and acquisition fees and expenses.  Costs of
improvements to the properties are capitalized, and repairs are
expensed.  Depreciation is recorded on the straight-line method.

Cash and cash equivalents consist of cash and highly liquid investments
with maturities, when purchased, of three months or less.

At least annually, and more often if circumstances dictate, the
Partnership evaluates the recoverability of the net carrying value of
its real estate.  As part of this evaluation, the fair values of each
of the properties are estimated (in some cases with the assistance of
outside real estate consultants) based on discounted cash flows.  The
fair values are compared to the properties' carrying amounts in the
financial statements.  A deficiency in fair value relative to carrying
amount is an indication of the need for a writedown due to impairment. 
In such case, the expected future net cash flows from the property are
estimated for a period of approximately five years, along with
estimated sales proceeds at the end of the period.  If the total of
these future undiscounted cash flows were less than the carrying amount
of the property, the property would be written down to its fair value,
and a loss on impairment recognized by a charge to earnings.  The
Partnership's policy complies with Statement of Financial Accounting
Standards No. 121, "Accounting for the Impairment of Long-Lived Assets
and for Long-Lived Assets to be Disposed Of".

Because the determination of fair value is based upon projections of
future economic events such as property occupancy rates, rental rates,
operating cost inflation and market capitalization rates which are
inherently subjective, the amounts ultimately realized at disposition
may differ materially from the net carrying value as of October 31,
1995.  The cash flows used to determine fair value and net realizable
value are based on good faith estimates and assumptions developed by
the Managing General Partner.  Unanticipated events and circumstances
may occur and some assumptions may not materialize; therefore actual
results may vary from the estimates and the variances may be material. 
The Partnership may provide additional write-downs which could be
material in subsequent years if real estate markets or local economic
conditions change.

Deferred leasing commissions are amortized over the applicable lease
terms.

Rental income is accrued on a straight-line basis over the terms of the
leases.  Accruals in excess of amounts payable by tenants pursuant to
their leases (resulting from rent concessions or rents which
periodically increase over the term of a lease) are recorded as
receivables and included in other assets. 

Net income (loss) per Unit amounts are calculated by dividing net
income (loss) allocated to Limited Partners, in accordance with the
Partnership Agreement, by the weighted average number of Units
outstanding.     

No provision for income taxes has been made in the financial
statements, since the liability for such taxes is that of the partners
rather than the Partnership.           

For income tax purposes, Partnership results are reported for the
calendar year.  The accounting policies used for tax reporting purposes
differ from those used for financial reporting as follows: (a)
depreciation is calculated using accelerated methods, (b) rental income
is recognized based on the payment terms in the applicable leases, and
(c) writedowns for impairment of real estate are not deductible.  In
addition, offering costs are treated differently for tax and financial
reporting purposes.  The tax basis of the Partnership's assets and
liabilities is approximately $3 million higher than the amounts
reported for financial statement purposes.

3.  Partnership Agreement

The Partnership Agreement provides that distributable cash, as defined,
will be paid 90% to the Limited Partners and 10% to the General
Partners.  

Sale or financing proceeds will be distributed, to the extent
available, first, to each Limited Partner, until there has been a
return of the Limited Partner's capital contribution, plus cumulative
distributions of distributable cash and sale or financing proceeds, in
an amount sufficient to provide a 9% cumulative annual return on the 
Limited Partner's adjusted capital contribution.  Thereafter, any
remaining sale or financing proceeds will be distributed 85% to the
Limited Partners and 15% to the General Partners after the Managing
General Partner receives a brokerage fee of up to 3% of the selling
price of any equity investment.            

Taxable income generally will be allocated in the same proportions as
distributions of distributable cash or sale or financing proceeds
(except that the General Partners must be allocated at least 1% of
taxable income from sales or financings).  In the event there is no
distributable cash or sale or financing proceeds, taxable income will
be allocated 90% to the Limited Partners and 10% to the General
Partners.  Any tax loss will be allocated 90% to the Limited Partners
and 10% to the General Partners.

Distributions paid to limited partners include a return of capital per Unit
of limited partnership interest of $3.86, $15.00, and $13.15, for the years
ended October 31, 1995, 1994 and 1993, respectively, calculated as the
excess of cash distributed per Unit over the accumulated earnings per Unit
not previously distributed.

In fiscal 1994, in accordance with its policies for evaluating the recover-
ability of its real estate, the Partnership concluded that the values of 
the Harborgate office building and Arlington Business Center were impaired.  
Accordingly, in fiscal 1994, the Partnership recognized losses on impairment 
of these properties of approximately $6,130,000 and $4,707,000, respectively.

5.  Investment in Joint Venture

Century Square, Pasadena, California

In 1985, the Partnership purchased, for $9.7 million, a 25% general partnership
interest in the partnership (the "Joint Venture") which owns the property, an
office building.  An affiliate of the Partnership, Dean Witter Realty Income
Partnership II, L.P., purchased the remaining 75% general partnership interest.
Cash flow and profits and losses are allocated to the Partnership and the
affiliate according to their interests in the Joint Venture.                   


In fiscal 1994, the Joint Venture settled a lawsuit with the developer of the
property relating to certain defects in the parking structure and heating,
ventilation and air conditioning systems.  Pursuant to the settlement, the 
Joint Venture received $100,000 and $835,000 in 1995 and 1994, respectively.  
The Partnership's share of these proceeds were $25,000 and $208,750 in 1995 
and 1994, respectively, recorded as part of the distributions from the Joint 
Venture.  The Joint Venture will receive an additional $100,000 in fiscal 
year 1996.

6.    Loan Payable to Bank

In December 1992, the Partnership established a $3.8 million secured line
of credit with a bank.  Borrowings bore interest, at the prime rate plus
three quarters percent and were repayable in 18 consecutive equal
payments beginning September 1, 1994.  Approximately $2.7 million of the
initial draw under this line of credit was used to repay amounts borrowed
from an affiliate of the Managing General Partner in fiscal year 1993. 
In September 1994, this loan was repaid in its entirety.

7.    Leases

</TABLE>
The Partnership has determined that all leases relating to its
properties are operating leases.  The lease terms range from three to
fifteen years, and generally provide for fixed minimum rents with
rental escalation and/or expense reimbursement clauses.


8.  Related Party Transactions

An affiliate of the Managing General Partner provided property
management services for six properties in 1995, 1994 and 1993.  The
Partnership paid the affiliate management fees (included in property
operating expenses) of $186,538, $232,272 and $221,284 for the years
ended October 31, 1995, 1994 and 1993, respectively.

Another affiliate of the Managing General Partner performs
administrative functions and processes certain investor and tax
information on behalf of the Partnership.  In fiscal years 1995, 1994
and 1993 the affiliate was reimbursed $247,518, $278,250 and $278,500,
respectively (included in general and administrative expenses) for
these services. As of October 31, 1995, the affiliate was owed $40,092
for these services.
  
Prior to 1990, the Partnership borrowed funds from an affiliate of the
Managing General Partner to fund the cost of tenant improvements,
capital expenditures and other Partnership expenditures.  The loan
bears interest at the prime rate (8.75% as of October 31, 1995). 
Interest expense amounted to $342,221 in 1995, $281,361 in 1994, and
$287,091 in 1993.  At October 31, 1995 and 1994 the balance due to the
affiliate was $4,032,527 and $4,048,307, respectively.

Through January 31, 1995, the General Partners have deferred receipt
of an aggregate amount of $2,467,674 of distributions to which they are
entitled, including distributions of $38,658, $154,633 and $154,633 for
the years ended October 31, 1995, 1994 and 1993, respectively; amounts
deferred were charged against partners' capital and recorded as
liabilities to the General Partner.  Beginning with the February 28,
1995 distribution, the General Partners began to receive their
distributions currently.

9.  Litigation

On December 27, 1995, a class action lawsuit naming various public real
estate partnerships sponsored by Dean Witter Realty Inc. ("Realty")
(including the Partnership and its Managing General Partner and
Associate General Partner), Realty, Dean Witter Reynolds Inc. and
others as defendants was filed in Superior Court in California.  The
complaint alleges fraud, negligent misrepresentation, intentional and
negligent breach of fiduciary duty, unjust enrichment and related
claims and seeks compensatory and punitive damages in unspecified
amounts and injunctive and other equitable relief.  The defendants have
removed the case to the United States District Court for the Southern
District of California.  The defendants have not yet responded to the
complaint.  The defendants intend to vigorously defend the action.  
It is impossible to predict what financial exposure the Partnership may
have as a result of this litigation

10.  Subsequent Event

On November 28, 1995, the Partnership paid a cash distribution of $5.00 
per Unit to Limited Partners.  The distribution was $515,444 with
$463,900 distributed to the Limited Partners and $51,544 distributed
to the General Partners.  <PAGE>

1993, respectively, which they agreed to defer.  At October 31, 1995,
the General Partners have deferred receipt of a total of $2,467,674 of
such distributions.  The General Partners no longer defer their share
of cash distributions beginning with the distribution made in February

and reimbursed for certain expenses.  Information concerning such fees

ITEM 13.   CERTAIN RELATIONSHIPS AND RELATED TRANSACTIONS.

       As a result of their being partners of a limited partnership
which is the limited partner of the Associate General Partner, certain
current and former executive officers and directors of the Managing
General Partner also own indirect general partnership interests in the
Partnership.  The Partnership Agreement of the Partnership provides
that cash distributions and allocations of income and loss to the
General Partners be distributed or allocated 50% to the Managing
General Partner and 50% to the Associate General Partner.  The General
Partners' share of cash distributions and income or loss is described
in Item 5 above.

       All of the outstanding shares of common stock of the Managing
General Partner are owned by Realty, a Delaware corporation which is
a wholly-owned subsidiary of Dean Witter, Discover & Co.  The general
partner of the Associate General Partner is Dean Witter Realty Income
Associates I Inc., which is a wholly-owned subsidiary of Realty.  The
limited partner of the Associate General Partner is LSA 84 L.P., a
Delaware limited partnership.  Realty and certain current and former
executive officers and directors of Realty are partners of LSA 84 L.P. 
Additional information with respect to the directors and executive
officers and compensation of the Managing General Partner and
affiliates is contained in Items 10 and 11 above.

       The General Partners and their affiliates were paid certain fees
and reimbursed for certain expenses.  Information concerning such fees
and reimbursements is contained in Note 8 to the Consolidated Financial
Statements in Item 8 above.  The Partnership believes that the payment
of fees and the reimbursement of expenses to the General Partners and
their affiliates are on terms as favorable as would be obtained from
unrelated third parties.
