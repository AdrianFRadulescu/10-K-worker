ITEM 1.  BUSINESS
- - -----------------

        UniFirst is a leading company in the garment rental industry.  The
Company's services consist principally of renting, cleaning, and delivering a
variety of industrial employment garments on a periodic basis, usually weekly.
The Company also decontaminates and cleans garments which may have been exposed
to radioactive materials.  Customer billings are rendered and recorded as
revenues when services are performed.

        The Company's principal business, since its inception, has been the
rental and servicing of industrial employment uniforms and protective clothing
(such shirts, pants, jackets, coveralls, jumpsuits, lab coats, smocks and
aprons) as well as industrial wiper towels, floor mats and other non-garment
items.  The Company services its customers by picking up the soiled items on a
periodic basis, usually weekly, and delivering at the same time cleaned and
processed items.

        Through the Company's services, customers are provided with uniforms
and protective work clothing for their employees without the necessity of
investing working capital, which is particularly advantageous to customers
whose worker turnover is high.  The Company's centralized services, specialized
equipment and economies of scale generally allow it to be more cost effective
in providing garment services than the customers could be by themselves.  In
order to better service its customers, the Company maintains a relatively
higher level of inventory of garments in stock than it believes customary in
the industry.  Customers are given a broad selection of styles, colors, sizes,
fabrics and personalized emblems from which to choose.  The Company's uniform
program is intended not only to upgrade the image of the customers, but also to
improve the effectiveness, morale, safety and satisfaction of their employees.

        The Company services a wide variety of manufacturers, retailers and
service companies, including automobile dealers and service stations, bakeries,
transportation companies and agricultural processors.  Substantially all of the
Company's rental services are provided pursuant to written contracts, primarily
for a  term of three years.  The Company services over 100,000 customer
locations in 44 states and Canada from 99 service locations and distribution
centers.  For fiscal  1992, 1993 and 1994, the Company's garment rental
operations produced approximately 64%, 65% and 66%, respectively, of its
revenues, and non-garment rental items accounted for another 27%, 25% and 25%,
respectively, of its revenues, with no single customer accounting for more than
1% of total revenues in any year.

<PAGE>   3

Page 3


        The Company manufactures work pants and shirts for its garment rental
operations in its plants in Luquillo, Puerto Rico, and Cave City, Arkansas,
respectively.  These plants produced approximately 43% of all employment
garments which the Company placed in service during both fiscal 1994 and 1993.

        The Company is also in the specialized business of decontaminating and
cleaning work clothes which may have been exposed to radioactive materials.
The Company's customers in this market include the federal government, research
and development laboratories and utilities operating nuclear reactors.  The
Company maintains decontamination facilities at the site of a conventional
cleaning plant in Massachusetts and has specialized facilities exclusively for
its nuclear decontamination operations in Mississippi, New Mexico, California,
Washington, Hawaii, Pennsylvania, South Carolina, Virginia, Georgia, Illinois
and Iowa.

MARKETING

        The Company markets its services to potential customers through
approximately 230 trained sales representatives whose sole function is to
develop new sales by adding new accounts and who have no direct responsibility
for servicing customer accounts.  Potential customers are contacted by
telephone and also through sales appointments.  The Company has a
separately-staffed telemarketing program of approximately 30 people, designed
to provide broader and more efficient coverage by screening prospects for the
sales representatives.

        The Company believes that customer service is the most important
element in developing and maintaining its market position.  As of August 27,
1994, existing accounts were serviced by approximately 685 route salespersons
and 410 service support people who together are responsible for providing
prompt delivery service and ensuring expeditious handling of customer
requirements  regarding billings, adjustments, garment repairs and other
matters.  The Company's policy is to resolve all customer inquiries and
problems within 24 hours.

        The Company believes that its distinction between sales and service
personnel, which allows the route salespersons to monitor and maximize existing
customer satisfaction while others promote an ongoing new business effort, is
an important part of its competitive strategy.

        Customer service is enhanced by the Company's management information
systems, which provide instantaneous access to information on the customer
employees serviced by the Company.  Available data includes the status of
customer orders, inventory availability, shipping information and personal data
regarding individual customer employees, including names, sizes, uniform styles
and colors.

<PAGE>   4

Page 4


        The Company's emphasis on customer service is reflected throughout the
Company's business.  The Company believes that ownership of its own
manufacturing facilities increases its ability to control the quality of its
garments.   The Company believes its industrial cleaning facilities are among
the most modern in the industry.

        Expansion by the Company into new market areas is achieved through an
acquisition program and internal growth.  Internal expansion normally results
from extending sales routes into new market areas and then servicing the new
accounts from one of  the Company's existing facilities.  Since internal
expansion is thus limited to contiguous areas, the Company also has an
acquisition program to permit it to expand more widely into new market areas.
The Company believes that acquisitions are an effective manner of expanding its
customer base and foresees this avenue as an important source of growth.

COMPETITION

        The markets serviced by the Company are highly competitive.  Although
the Company is one of the larger companies engaged in the business of renting
and cleaning employment garments, there are other firms in the industry which
are larger and have greater financial resources than the Company.  The
principal methods of competition in the industry are quality of service and
price.  The Company believes that its ability to compete effectively is due
primarily to the superior service and support systems which it provides to its
customers.

RAW MATERIALS

        The Company obtained through its manufacturing operations approximately
43% of all garments which it placed in service during fiscal 1994, with other
items and the balance of garments being purchased from a variety of suppliers.
The Company has experienced no significant difficulty in obtaining any of its
raw materials or supplies.

EMPLOYEES

        The Company employs approximately 5,500 persons, about 6% of whom are
represented by unions pursuant to 7 separate collective bargaining agreements.
The Company considers its employee relations to be satisfactory.

ENVIRONMENTAL MATTERS

        All industrial laundries use and have to dispose of detergent waste
water and/or dry cleaning residues.  The Company is aware of the environmental
concerns surrounding the disposal of these materials and has taken steps to
avoid their improper disposal.  Although from time to time the Company is
subject to administrative and judicial proceedings involving environmental
matters, the Company does not foresee a material effect on its  earnings or
competitive position in connection with such proceedings or its compliance with
federal, state and local provisions regulating the environment.  The Company's
nuclear garment decontamination facilities are licensed by the Nuclear
Regulatory Commission or, in certain instances, by the applicable state agency.

        The Company and several other unaffiliated parties have been identified
by the United States Environmental Protection Agency ("EPA") as having
contributed to the presence of hazardous substances  in the ground water in
Woburn, Massachusetts.  The Company has not incurred, and does not currently
anticipate incurring, expenses in  connection therewith which would have a
material adverse effect on  its financial position as a result thereof.

            REPORT OF INDEPENDENT PUBLIC ACCOUNTANTS ON SUPPLEMENTAL
               SCHEDULES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS



To UniFirst Corporation:

        We have audited, in  accordance with generally accepted auditing
standards, the consolidated financial statements included in this Form 10-K,
and have issued our report thereon dated November 1, 1994.  Our report on the
consolidated financial statements includes an explanatory paragraph with
respect to the change in the method of accounting for income taxes, effective
September 1, 1991, as discussed in Note 3 to the consolidated financial
statements. Our audit was made for the purpose of forming an opinion on the
basic consolidated financial statements taken as a whole.  The supplemental
schedules to the consolidated financial statements listed as Item 14(a)(2) in
the Form 10-K are the responsibility of the Company's management and are
presented for purposes of complying with the Securities and Exchange
Commission's rules and are not part of the basic consolidated financial
statements.  These supplemental schedules have been subjected to the auditing
procedures applied in the audit of the basic consolidated financial statements
and, in our opinion, fairly state, in all material respects, the financial data
required to be set forth therein, in relation to the basic consolidated
financial statements taken as a whole.

Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results
of Operations 

UniFirst Corporation and Subsidiaries


Fiscal 1994 Compared with Fiscal 1993

In 1994 revenues increased $30.3 million or 10.5% over 1993. This increase can
be attributed to internal growth and modest price increases (9.2%) and
acquisitions (1.3%).

Income from operations increased to $32.5 million in 1994 from $30.7 million in
1993.  As a percent of revenues, income from operations decreased to 10.2% in
1994 from 10.7% in 1993.  The primary reasons for the decrease are unfavorable
comparative contribution results from the nuclear garment decontamination
business, start-up costs associated with a new emblem image process for our
customers and higher uniform merchandise costs in 1994.

During 1994, net interest expense (interest expense less interest income) was
$2.5 million as compared to $2.7 million in 1993.  The decrease is primarily
attributable to lower average interest rates in fiscal 1994.

The Company's provision for income taxes was 37.0% for both years.  Although
the rates were the same for both years, in 1994 the favorable impact of a new
corporate-owned life insurance program was offset by higher state income taxes.


Fiscal 1993 Compared with Fiscal 1992

In 1993 revenues increased $19.5 million or 7.3% over 1992.  This increase was
generated primarily by internal growth and modest price increases.

Income from operations increased to $30.7 million in 1993 from $26.0 million in
1992.  As a percent of revenues, income from operations increased to 10.7% in
1993 from 9.7% in 1992.  The primary reasons for the increase are the result of
improved margin performances in 1993 from the core rental businesses and a $1.2
million (.4%) charge to operations in 1992 for the closing of the Company's
Pembroke, Ontario manufacturing plant.

During 1993, net interest expense (interest expense less interest income) was
$2.7 million as compared to $4.1 million in 1992.  The decrease is attributable
to repayment of debt and lower interest rates in 1993.

The Company's provision for income taxes was 37.0% in 1993 and 34.5% in 1992.
The increase is due primarily to an increase in the statutory federal income
tax rate and higher state income taxes in 1993.

Liquidity and Capital Resources

The Company's balance sheet continued to strenghten in 1994.  Net cash provided
by operating activities was $28.1 million in 1994 and totaled $98.7 million for
the three years ended August 27, 1994.  These cash flows were used to fund
$61.5 million in capital expenditures to expand and update Company facilities.
Additionally, $19.6 million was used for acquisitions during this three year
period.

Shareholders' equity as a percent of total capital has increased from 67.1% at
August 31, 1991 to 78.2% at August 27, 1994, indicating the significant
improvement in the overall strength of the Company's balance sheet.

The Company had $4.1 million in cash and cash equivalents as well as a line of
credit to borrow an additional $31.1 million as of August 27, 1994.  The        
Company believes its ability to generate cash from operations will adequately
cover its foreseeable capital requirements.

Effects of Inflation

Inflation has had the effect of increasing the reported amounts of the  
Company's revenues and costs.  The Company uses the last-in, first-out (LIFO)
method to value a significant portion of inventories.  This method tends to
reduce the amount of income due to inflation included in the Company's results
of operations.  The Company believes that, through increases in its prices, it
has been able to recover increases in costs and expenses attributable to
inflation.

1.  SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

Principles of Consolidation and Other
The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company and
its subsidiaries, all of which are wholly-owned.  Intercompany balances and
transactions are eliminated in consolidation.  The Company recognizes revenues
when the actual services are provided to customers.

Inventories
Inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market value.  The Company uses
the last-in, first-out (LIFO) method to value a significant portion of its
inventories.  Inventory valued on the LIFO method approximates $12,257,000 and
$8,492,000 at August 27, 1994 and August 28, 1993, respectively.  The remaining
inventories are priced at the lower of first-in, first-out (FIFO) cost or
market.  Had the Company used the FIFO accounting method, inventories would
have been approximately $816,000 and $776,000 higher at August 27, 1994 and
August 28, 1993, respectively.

Rental Merchandise in Service
Rental merchandise in service, stated at cost less amortization, is being
amortized on a straight-line basis over the estimated service lives (primarily
12 months) of the merchandise.

Property and Equipment
The Company provides for depreciation on the straight-line method based upon
the following estimated useful lives:

        Buildings                  30-40 years
        Leasehold improvements   Term of lease
        Machinery and equipment     3-10 years
        Motor vehicles               3-7 years

Other Assets
Covenants are amortized over the terms of the respective non-competition
agreements, which range from five to fifteen years.  Customer contracts are
amortized over periods of up to seventeen years.  Goodwill is amortized over
periods of up to forty years.

Net Income Per Common Share
Net income per common share is calculated on a primary basis using the weighted
average number of common and common equivalent shares outstanding during the
year.  Common equivalent shares include the number of shares issuable under the
Company's stock option plan.  Prior to the convertible debt retirement in the
fourth quarter of 1992, net income per share on a fully diluted basis also
assumed the conversion of the Company's convertible subordinated debt and the
elimination of the related interest expense, net of tax.

Cash Flow Disclosures
Cash and cash equivalents include cash in banks and bank short-term repurchase
agreements with maturities of less than ninety days.


2.  ACQUISITIONS

During fiscal 1994, the Company acquired three industrial laundry businesses
for cash and notes amounting to $9,815,000.  During fiscal 1993, the Company
acquired an industrial laundry business for $1,124,000.  These acquisitions
have been accounted for as purchases and, accordingly, have been included on
the Company's consolidated statements of income since their respective
acquisition dates.

3.  INCOME TAXES (continued)

The Company has negotiated a tax exemption grant for its Puerto Rico
subsidiary under which the subsidiary is tax-exempt on 90% of its income
through 2001.  The Company provides for anticipated tollgate taxes on the
repatriation of the subsidiary's accumulated earnings.

During the second quarter of fiscal 1992 the Company adopted Statement of
Financial Accounting Standards No. 109 (SFAS 109), "Accounting for Income
Taxes", retroactive to September 1, 1991.  The cumulative effect of this change
was an increase to net income of $1,200,000.  The Company has elected not to
restate prior years' financial statements for the effects of this change.

The tax effect of items giving rise to the Company's deferred tax liabilities
are as follows:

</TABLE>

Aggregate current maturities of long-term obligations for each of the next five
years are $6,874,000, $6,700,000, $22,640,000, $731,000 and $749,000    
respectively.  At August 27, 1994 and August 28, 1993, the fair value of the
Company's outstanding debt approximates its carrying value.

The Company's revolving credit agreement runs through 1997.  As of August 27,   
1994, the maximum line of credit was $50,000,000.

In 1993 the Company entered into an interest rate swap agreement with a bank,
notional amount $10,000,000, maturing October 31, 1994.  The Company pays a
fixed rate of 4.9% and receives a variable rate tied to the LIBOR rate.  As of  
August 27, 1994 the variable rate was 4.8125%.

On June 3, 1992 the Company exercised its option to retire $20,000,000 in       
outstanding convertible debt and paid a prepayment premium.  This amount,
$2,620,000, net of tax, was recorded as an extraordinary item.

Certain of the long-term obligations contain among other things, provisions
regarding net worth, working capital and dividends.  Under the most restrictive
of these provisions, the Company is required to maintain minimum consolidated   
tangible net worth of $96,347,000 as of August 27, 1994.  Additionally, retained
earnings available for the payment of dividends was $98,424,000 at August 27,
1994.  Certain notes payable arising from acquisitions are secured by assets of
the acquired company.


5.  EMPLOYEE BENEFIT PLANS

The Company has combined 401(k) and profit sharing plans for all eligible
employees not under collective bargaining agreements.  The amount of the        
Company's contribution is determined at the discretion of the Company.
Contributions charged to income under the plan were $3,200,000 in 1994,
$3,000,000 in 1993, and $2,800,000 in 1992.

Some employees under collective bargaining agreements are covered by
union-sponsored multi-employer pension plans. Company contributions, generally  
based upon hours worked, are in accordance with negotiated labor contracts.
Payments to the plans amounted to $176,000 in 1994, $280,000 in 1993, and
$208,000 in 1992.  Information is not readily available for the Company to
determine its share of unfunded vested benefits, if any, under these plans.

8.  COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES

Lease Commitments
The Company leases certain buildings from independent parties.  Total rent
expense on all leases was $1,581,000 in 1994, $1,637,000 in 1993 and $1,711,000
in 1992.  

Annual minimum lease commitments for all years subsequent to August 27, 1994
are $1,401,000 in 1995, $930,000 in 1996, $602,000 in 1997, $428,000 in 1998 and
$242,000 in 1999.

Contingencies
The Company and its subsidiaries are subject to legal proceedings and claims
arising from the conduct of their business operations, including personal
injury, customer contract, employment claims and environmental matters.  In the
opinion of management, such proceedings and claims are not likely to result in
losses which would have a material adverse effect upon the Company.        

As security for certain agreements, the Company had standby irrevocable bank
commercial letters of credit and mortgages of approximately $12,695,000 and     
$14,952,000 outstanding as of August 27, 1994 and August 28, 1993, respectively.

9.  COMMON STOCK OPTIONS

The Company had adopted an incentive stock option plan in April, 1983 and
reserved 800,000 shares of common stock for issue under the plan.  Options
granted under the plan were at a price of not less than 100% of the fair market 
value on the date of grant and expired ten years after the grant date.  Options
for 250,000 shares at $3.50 per share and 168,000 shares at $3.64 per share
were granted in 1983 and 1984, respectively.  During 1993 the plan expired.

10.  SHAREHOLDERS' EQUITY

On November 18, 1993 the Company's Board of Directors declared a two-for-one
stock split, to be effected in the form of a stock dividend, on the Company's
Common Stock and Class B Common Stock.  The stock dividend was paid on January
19, 1994 to shareholders of record on January 5, 1994.  All references to
average number of shares outstanding and per share data in these financial
statements reflect the effect of the two-for-one split.  

During 1993 the Company's shareholders voted to amend its Articles of   
Organization to increase the number of authorized common shares from
20,000,000 to 30,000,000, and to authorize a new Class B common stock with
20,000,000 authorized shares.  The offer to exchange, on a share-for-share
basis, shares of Class B common stock for shares of common stock resulted in
12,627,954 shares of common stock being exchanged for shares of Class B common
stock.  

The significant attributes of each type of stock are as follows:

Common stock -- Each share is entitled to one vote and is freely transferable.
Each share of common stock is entitled to a cash dividend equal to 125% of any
cash dividend paid on each share of Class B common stock.                 


Class B common stock -- Each share is entitled to ten votes and can be
converted to common stock on a share-for-share basis.  Until converted to
common stock, however, Class B shares are not freely transferable. 
Substantially all shares of Class B common stock are held by officers of the
Company.

Report of Independent Public Accountants


To the Board of Directors and Shareholders of UniFirst Corporation:

We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of UniFirst
Corporation (a Massachusetts corporation) and subsidiaries as of August 27,
1994 and August 28, 1993 and the related consolidated statements of income,
shareholders' equity and cash flows for each of the three years in the period
ended August 27, 1994.  These consolidated financial statements are the
responsibility of the Company's management.  Our responsibility is to express
an opinion on these consolidated financial statements based on our audits.

We conducted our audits in accordance with generally accepted auditing
standards.  Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to
obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements
are free of material misstatement.  An audit includes examining, on a test
basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial
statements.  An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used
and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall
financial statement presentation.  We believe that our audits provide a
reasonable basis for our opinion.

In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present
fairly, in all material respects, the consolidated financial position of
UniFirst Corporation and subsidiaries as of August 27, 1994 and August 28, 1993
and the results of their operations and their cash flows for each of the three
years in the period ended August 27, 1994, in conformity with generally
accepted accounting principles.

As explained in Note 3 to the consolidated financial statements, effective
September 1, 1991, the Company changed its method of accounting for income
taxes.
