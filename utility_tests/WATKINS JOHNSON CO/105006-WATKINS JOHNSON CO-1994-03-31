                                    PART I


ITEM 1. BUSINESS

  (a) General Development of Business

      The company has continued to conduct its business under the same corporate
      structure. There have been no material reclassifications, mergers, or
      consolidations of the company or its subsidiaries during the year. During
      1990-1991, the company realigned and restructured its operations into
      three principal elements which were renamed in 1993; semiconductor
      equipment, electronics, and environmental services. There have been no
      acquisitions or dispositions of material amounts of assets other than in
      the ordinary course of business during 1993.

  (b) Financial Information about Industry Segments

      The company operates within three industry segments-semiconductor
      equipment, electronics, and environmental services. Financial information
      about industry segments is included in Note 10 to the consolidated
      financial statements contained in Part II, Item 8 of this annual report on
      Form 10-K.

  (c) Narrative Description of Business

      Semiconductor Equipment

      The Semiconductor Equipment Group manufactures semiconductor processing
      equipment, primarily chemical-vapor deposition (CVD) equipment. The
      company's atmospheric-pressure CVD equipment is used by semiconductor
      manufacturers worldwide in the production of memory devices (DRAMs) and
      microprocessors.

      Historically, the company's CVD systems have been used primarily for the
      deposition of interlevel-dielectric films--the first dielectric layer on a
      semiconductor wafer. The company's current principal product, the TEOS999
      System, deposits both interlevel and intermetal layers of film on
      sub-half-micron geometries. The addition of the intermetal capability
      increased the potential market size for W-J's CVD equipment.

      The company's next-generation product, the WJ-1000 System, is designed for
      high-throughput CVD onto the 200-mm (8-inch) wafers currently entering
      production in major fabrication facilities in the U.S. and overseas.

      A variant of Watkins-Johnson's semiconductor-production tool is used for
      manufacturing flat-panel displays for personal-communication, computing
      and entertainment products.

      Semiconductor equipment products are primarily marketed through
      manufacturers' representatives and global distributor networks. Sales by
      the segment were 28% of consolidated sales in 1993, 21% in 1992 and 24% in
      1991.

      Semiconductor equipment product customers are numerous. The majority
      of the segment's sales are to manufacturers of semiconductor integrated
      circuits. There are several domestic and international competitors and
      competition is intense. In meeting the competition, emphasis is placed on
      selling quality products having excellent reliability and performance and
      a strong customer support network.

      Electronics

      The Electronics Group manufactures turnkey systems, integrated subsystems
      and signal-processing components for a broad range of communications and
      defense applications. The group is serving new customers who have
      wireless-communication and "dual-use" requirements in addition to
      supplying sophisticated electronic products for defense-intelligence,
      missile-guidance and space-communications missions.

      Recent commercial contracts include high-fidelity W-J cellular receivers
      to monitor ongoing telephone traffic to ensure authorized use of the
      system, transponder subsystems to enable ship traffic to navigate
      treacherous waterways during inclement weather and signal-processing
      components for a wide range of wireless-communications products.

      Watkins-Johnson receivers, antennas and signal-analysis equipment are used
      by both commercial and military governmental agencies to perform
      range-monitoring, frequency-measurement, signal-localization and
      interference-analysis functions, often in complex, high-signal-density
      environments.

      Key missile programs, such as the Advanced Medium-Range Air-to-Air Missile
      (AMRAAM) and the High-speed Anti Radiation Missile (HARM) continue to
      represent a substantial portion of the group's core defense-electronics
      business.

      Electronics products are marketed through direct sales efforts and
      distributor networks. Sales by the electronics segment were 70% of
      consolidated sales in 1993, 76% in 1992 and 72% in 1991. The majority of
      the segment sales is made to government agencies and to customers engaged
      in defense contracting. The principal customer for such sales is the U.S.
      Department of Defense. Sales contracts with the government are customarily
      subject to terms and conditions which provide for renegotiation of profits
      or termination of the contract at the election of the government. The
      right to terminate for convenience has not had any significant effect on
      the company's financial position or results of operations.

      The electronics segment has numerous competitors which include both large
      diversified corporations and smaller specialty firms. Due to the various
      industries in which the company and its competitors operate, a competitive
      ranking cannot be reasonably established. However, the electronics segment
      is a leading supplier in several of its product markets. In meeting its
      competition the company offers quality products featuring excellent
      reliability and performance at competitive prices.

      Environmental Services

      W-J Environmental (WJE) specializes in hydrogeology and offers services
      from the remedial investigation of contaminated-water sites through the
      remedial action necessary to eliminate the environmental problem.

      The recent addition of an environmental engineering capability enabled WJE
      to design and install an innovative wastewater-minimization system which
      eliminates the discharge of heavy metals and cyanide into the public sewer
      system. This system is being marketed to manufacturers and governmental
      agencies charged with finding ways to cope with increasingly restrictive
      environmental regulations.

      The unit also markets its capabilities in chemistry, microbiology,
      geophysics, toxicology, risk assessment and data management to customers
      who do not require a full range of environmental services, but have a
      serious requirement for one or two areas of expertise which our new group
      can satisfy.

      Other Business Items

      Raw materials for the production of semiconductor equipment and
      electronics products are obtained from numerous suppliers. Dependence on
      any particular supplier is minimal. Business operations are not believed
      to be seasonal. Except for negotiated advance or progress payments from
      customers on long-term contracts in the defense-electronics business,
      there are no special working capital practices in any of the three
      segments.

      The company has been increasingly active in securing patents and licensing
      agreements to protect certain proprietary technologies and know-how
      resulting from its on-going research and development efforts. Although the
      company holds and has filings pending on numerous domestic and foreign
      patents and technology licenses for the manufacture and sale of various
      products, patents have not significantly affected the company's operations
      or financial performance. Management believes the company's competitive
      position is derived primarily from its core competence of engineering,
      manufacturing and understanding of its customers and markets.

      Total company backlog at December 31, 1993 was $222,628,000 compared to
      $207,827,000 at December 31, 1992. The percentage of backlog attributable
      to the semiconductor equipment and electronics segments were 22% and 77%
      respectively in 1993, compared to 9% and 89% in 1992. Approximately 86% of
      all backlog at year-end 1993 is expected to be shippable within 12 months
      compared to 83% at year-end 1992.

      Company-sponsored research and development expense was $27,163,000 in
      1993, $27,210,000 in 1992, and $27,180,000 in 1991. Customer-sponsored
      research and development was estimated to be approximately $18,000,000
      in 1993, $25,000,000 in 1992, and $15,000,000 in 1991.

      The company's employment on December 31, 1993 was 2,390. None of the
      company's employees is covered by a collective bargaining agreement. The
      company's relationship with its employees is good.

      Environmental issues are discussed in Note 8 to the consolidated financial
      statements contained in Part II, Item 8 of this annual report on Form
      10-K.

  (d) Financial Information about Foreign and Domestic Operations and Export
      Sales.

      Company foreign operation assets and sales are less than ten percent of
      consolidated totals. Sales outside the United States accounted for 33% of
      the company's sales in 1993, 25% in 1992, and 30% in 1991. The inherent
      risks of foreign business are similar to those of domestic business but
      with the additional risks of foreign government instability and export
      license cancellation. A major portion of foreign product orders in the
      electronics segment requires export licensing by the Department of State
      prior to shipment. For international shipments of electronics and
      semiconductor equipment, the company purchases forward exchange contracts
      and/or obtains customer letters of credit to reduce foreign currency
      fluctuation and credit risks. For further information on foreign sales,
      see Note 7 and Note 10 to the consolidated financial statements contained
      in Part II, Item 8 of this annual report on Form 10-K.

ITEM 2. PROPERTIES

      Watkins-Johnson Company and subsidiaries conduct their main operations at
      plants in Palo Alto, Scotts Valley and San Jose, California and
      Gaithersburg, Maryland. Additional operations are conducted in Columbia,
      Maryland, and Windsor, England. The company has nine field offices in the
      United States and five offices overseas. As part of the company's cost
      reduction efforts, the 56,000 square-foot facility located in North
      Carolina was closed in 1991.

      At December 31, 1993 there were approximately 732,000 square feet of plant
      space in California, 225,000 square feet in Maryland, and 15,000 square
      feet in England. Approximately 90% of the company's plant space is
      occupied for the company's operations. The company is pursuing
      opportunities to realize the market value of its properties while ensuring
      efficient use of available space.

      The electronics segment utilizes substantially all of the above named
      facilities except for the Scotts Valley plant, which houses the
      semiconductor equipment segment. In addition, the environmental services
      division maintains leased field offices located in Palo Alto, California
      and Denver, Colorado.

      The Palo Alto and Columbia facilities are leased. Sales offices are also
      leased. The San Jose plant is held subject to a long-term mortgage.
      Information on long-term obligations is in Note 3 to the consolidated
      financial statements contained in Part II, item 8 of this annual report on
      Form 10-K.

ITEM 3. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS

      Information required under this item is contained in Note 6 and Note 8 to
      the consolidated financial statements contained in Part II, Item 8 of this
      annual report on Form 10-K.


ITEM 4. SUBMISSION OF MATTERS TO A VOTE OF SECURITY HOLDERS

      The company submitted no matters to a vote of the shareowners during the
      last quarter of the period covered by this report.

ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND
        RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

      Financial Condition:

      The company's financial condition remains strong while operations
      continued to generate sufficient funds for growth. During 1993 cash and
      equivalents decreased slightly from $49 million to $45 million as a result
      of higher demands on working capital and increased business volume. The
      company continues to be in excellent position to pursue investment
      opportunities including additional product development, potential
      acquisitions and stock repurchase. The company had no significant
      commitments outstanding at the end of the year.

      Current Operations:

      Performance of the Semiconductor Equipment Group was excellent in 1993.
      Sales and profit rebounded strongly from the poor conditions of the last
      two years. Sales volume in the Asia/Pacific region and the U. S. increased
      substantially. During 1993 Semiconductor Equipment Group facilities were
      modified to improve production efficiency and capacity in keeping pace
      with delivery commitments. The Semiconductor Equipment Group's record
      backlog at year-end indicates that a similar level of business volume is
      likely to continue through the first half of 1994.

      Electronics Group sales were steady in 1993 while profits declined
      slightly. Lower margins were attributable to the disruption of operations
      resulting from the consolidation of a product line during the first half
      of 1993. Persistent pricing pressures from customers and competitors also
      contributed to the lower profitability. The Electronics Group is
      positioning itself to achieve a better balance between commercial and
      defense products. During 1993 the group was successful in capturing orders
      for high-end microwave components, RF receiver opportunities and other
      wireless communication products for commercial applications.

      It must be recognized that the semiconductor equipment business is
      cyclical and can change rapidly. Uncertainty increases significantly when
      projecting demand for semiconductor equipment products more than six
      months into the future. Over a longer horizon, uncertainty persists as to
      how changes in worldwide defense spending may affect sales of the
      company's Electronic Group products. Therefore, the performance and
      results of 1993 may not be indicative of future performance.

      Result of Operations:

      1993 Compared to 1992   Semiconductor Equipment Group sales jumped 46%
      while Electronics Group sales remained flat. Margins improved
      significantly in the Semiconductor Equipment Group due to the higher
      volume and operational efficiencies. This more than offset the slight
      decline in profit margins experienced in the Electronics Group as
      explained above. As a result, the combined gross margin improved from 34%
      in 1992 to 35% in 1993. Selling and administrative expenses were higher as
      expected due to the increase in volume and expenses associated with the
      profitability of the company. In a percentage-of-sales comparison, selling
      and administrative expenses were favorable relative to 1992 but may
      increase in 1994 due to anticipated higher commissions and expenses
      associated with certain international sales. Research and development
      expenses decreased for the first three quarters of 1993 as activities
      eased from the intense levels experienced in 1992. In the fourth quarter
      1993, Semiconductor Equipment Group began to reemphasize research and
      development activities to focus on the next generation of products to meet
      the time-to-market window.

      The higher level of research and development expenses incurred in the
      fourth quarter is expected to continue for at least the first half of
      1994. All other nonoperating income and expenses were within expectations.
      Due to the combined effect of the above factors, 1993 net income of
      $11,596,000 more than doubled the 1992 income of $4,963,000 before the
      cumulative effect of an accounting change. A cumulative tax benefit of
      $5,438,000 was added to the 1992 year-end results due to the adoption of
      Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 109, "Accounting for
      Income Taxes".

      1992 Compared to 1991   Company sales decreased 5%, mostly attributable to
      the continued softness in semiconductor-equipment business while
      electronics sales were flat. The company was able to achieve a 34% gross
      margin and an inventory turnover rate of more than four times a year by
      maintaining minimum levels of inventory during 1992. Although 1992 gross
      margins improved from the 32% in 1991, all elements of cost were under
      substantial pressure because of the extremely competitive business
      environment. The decline in selling and administrative expenses was
      primarily attributable to the company's continual cost reduction efforts.
      Research and development expenses were maintained at 10% of sales to
      improve our competitive position in both the electronics and semiconductor
      equipment markets. Intense R&D efforts resulted in several acceptances by
      key customers of our TEOS-Ozone process, indicating increased order
      opportunities for the Semiconductor Equipment Group. As discussed below,
      certain nonrecurring provisions related to restructuring, environmental
      remediation and government claims adversely affected 1991 results. The
      provisions made in 1991 continued to appear adequate to meet the company's
      obligations. Interest income was higher in 1992 resulting from additional
      funds for investment. All other nonoperating income and expenses were
      within expectations. The company adopted provisions of Statement of
      Financial Accounting Standards No. 109, "Accounting for Income Taxes"
      (SFAS 109) resulting in a cumulative tax benefit of $5,438,000. Income
      before the cumulative adjustment was $.66 per share in 1992 compared to a
      net loss of $2.98 per share in 1991.

                 WATKINS-JOHNSON COMPANY AND SUBSIDIARIES

                NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS


1. SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

Principles of Consolidation--The consolidated financial statements include those
of the company and its subsidiaries after elimination of intercompany balances
and transactions.

Cash Equivalents--Cash equivalents consist principally of U.S. Treasury bills
and commercial paper acquired with remaining maturity periods of ninety days or
less and are stated at cost plus accrued interest which approximates market
value. The company's investment guidelines limit holdings in commercial paper to
$1,000,000 per issuer.

Inventories--Inventories are stated at the lower of cost, using first-in,
first-out and average-cost basis, or market. Cost of inventory items is based on
purchase and production cost. Long-term contract costs and selling and
administrative expenses are excluded from inventory. Progress payments are not
netted against inventory.

Property, Plant and Equipment--Property, plant and equipment are stated at cost.
Leases which at inception assure the lessor full recovery of the fair market
value of the property over the lease term are capitalized. Provision for
depreciation and amortization is primarily based on the sum-of-the-years'-digits
and declining-balance methods.

Revenue Recognition--Revenue on fixed-price contracts other than long-term
contracts is recorded upon shipment or completion of tasks as specified in the
contract. Sales and allowable fees under cost-reimbursement contracts are
recorded as costs are incurred. Long-term contract sales and cost of goods sold
are recognized using the percentage-of-completion method based on the actual
physical completion of work performed and the ratio of costs incurred to total
estimated costs to complete the contract. Any anticipated losses on contracts
are charged to earnings when identified.

Income Taxes--In 1992 the company adopted Statement of Financial Accounting
Standard No. 109, "Accounting for Income Taxes" (SFAS 109); previously the
company had accounted for taxes under SFAS 96 (see Note 7). Under both SFAS 109
and 96, the consolidated statements of income include provisions (benefits) for
deferred income taxes using the "liability" method for transactions that are
reported in one period for financial accounting purposes and in another period
for income tax purposes. State and local income taxes are included in selling
and administrative expenses.

Per Share Information--Beginning in 1993 net income per share is computed using
the weighted average number of common and common equivalent shares (dilutive
stock options) outstanding during the year. The difference between fully diluted
earnings per share and primary earnings per share is not significant. Prior to
1993, the computation excluded outstanding stock options as their dilutive
effect was not material.

Reclassification--Certain amounts for 1992 and 1991 have been reclassified to
conform to the 1993 presentation.


2. RECEIVABLES

Receivables consist of the following (in thousands):


                                               1993              1992
                                             ----------        ----------
U.S. Government long-term contracts:
  Billed ..............................       $ 2,936          $  2,125
  Unbilled  ...........................         4,896             3,560
Commercial long-term contracts:
  Billed ..............................         3,818             2,416
  Unbilled  ...........................        11,917            10,367
                                             ----------        ----------
Total long-term contract receivables ..        23,567            18,468
Other trade receivables ...............        50,404            37,094
                                             ----------        ----------
   Total receivables less allowance of
     $999 in 1993 and $982 in 1992 ....       $73,971           $55,562
                                             ==========        ==========

Unbilled receivables represent revenue recognized for long-term contracts not
yet billable based on the terms of the contract. These amounts are billable upon
shipment of the product, achievement of milestones, or completion of the
contract. Unbilled receivables are expected to be billed and collected within
one year. Receivables representing retainage not collectible within one year are
not material. There are no significant billed or unbilled receivables subject to
future negotiation.

Government contracts have provisions for audit, price redetermination and other
profit and cost limitations. Contracts may be terminated without prior notice at
the Government's convenience. In the event of such termination, the company
may be compensated for work performed, a reasonable allowance for profit, and
commitments at the time of termination. The right to terminate for convenience
has not had any significant effect on the company's financial position or
results of operations.


3. LONG-TERM OBLIGATIONS AND LINES OF CREDIT

Long-term obligations, excluding amounts due within one year, consist of (in
thousands):


                                         1993              1992
                                       ----------        ----------
Mortgage ...........................    $ 4,238           $ 5,508
Deferred compensation ..............      4,034             2,898
Environmental remediation ..........     10,257            11,933
Long-term leases ...................      7,934             8,305
                                       ----------        ----------
   Total ...........................    $26,463           $28,644
                                       ==========        ==========

The current portion of long-term obligations is included in current liabilities.
The expected maturity amounts are as follows: 1994, $4,102,000; 1995,
$1,873,000; 1996, $1,917,000; 1997, $1,964,000, 1998, $2,016,000.

Mortgage--Primarily consists of a mortgage bearing 8-3/4% interest secured by
the San Jose, California plant. The annual payments totaling $710,000
continue into the year 2003 and are payable in monthly installments. Based
on the borrowing rates currently available to the company for loans with
similar terms, the carrying value of the mortgage approximates fair value.

Deferred Compensation--The company has deferred compensation plans covering
selected members of management and key technical employees. The purpose is to
reward and encourage talented employees to remain with the company.

Environmental Remediation--As discussed in Note 8, the company is obligated to
remediate groundwater contamination at the Scotts Valley and Palo Alto
facilities. The portion expected to be paid within one year is included in
current liabilities.

Leases--Certain long-term leases for plant facilities are treated as capital
leases for financial statement purposes. The leases expire during the years 1994
to 2014, however renewal options provide for lease extensions ranging from
fifteen to thirty-five years at revised rental terms. The company also has
noncancellable operating leases for plant facilities and equipment expiring
through 1996. The leases may be renewed for various periods after the initial
term. Payment obligations under these capitalized and operating leases as of
December 31, 1993 are as follows (in thousands):


                                        CAPITAL        OPERATING

Rent expense for property and equipment relating to operating leases is as
follows (in thousands):


                                        1993           1992          1991

                                      ========       ========      =======

Lines of Credit--The company has arranged with certain banks to provide
unsecured revolving lines of credit totaling $23,500,000. These agreements
are generally renegotiated on an annual basis. No material compensating
balances are required or maintained. Borrowings under these facilities
generally bear interest at prime rate, which was 6 percent in 1993.
The lines of credit were substantially unused during the year. The
amount of outstanding letters of credit and other guarantees, which may
reduce the company's available lines, totaled $4,230,000
at December 31, 1993.


4. SHAREOWNERS' EQUITY

Stock Repurchase Program--The Board of Directors has authorized the company to
repurchase a maximum of 1,500,000 shares of company stock. Approximately 936,000
shares have been repurchased through December 31, 1993.

Common Share Purchase Rights--For each share of company common stock
outstanding, one Common Share Purchase Right is attached. The Rights expire
October 20, 1996, and may be redeemed by the company for $.01 per Right at any
time prior to 15 days after an entity acquires 20% or more of the company's
common stock. The Rights become exercisable if an entity acquires 20% or more of
the company's outstanding common stock, or announces an offer which would result
in such entity acquiring 30% or more of the company's common stock. When
exercisable, the Rights trade separately from the common stock and entitle a
holder to buy one share of the company's common stock for $160. If the company
is subsequently involved in a merger or other business combination, each Right
will entitle its holder to buy a number of shares of common stock of the
surviving company having a market value of twice the $160 exercise price. The
Rights also provide for protection against self-dealing transactions by a
controlling shareowner.

Stock Option Plans--The Employee Stock Option Plan provides for grants of
nonqualifying and incentive stock options to certain key employees and officers.
The options are granted at the market price on date of grant and expire at the
tenth anniversary date. One-third of the options granted are exercisable in each
of the third, fourth and fifth succeeding years. The Plan allows those employees
who are subject to the insider trading restrictions certain limited rights to
receive cash in the event of a change in control. Shares issued are net of
retirement of shares used in payment for options exercised. In addition, the
Plan permits the award of restricted stock rights subject to a fixed vesting
schedule. The holder of vested restricted stock has certain dividend, voting,
and other shareowner rights. No restricted stock awards have been made through
December 31, 1993.

The Nonemployee Directors Stock Option Plan provides for a fixed schedule of
options to be granted through 1998. Options granted are exercisable similarly to
the Employee Stock Option Plan. The total number of shares to be issued under
this plan may not exceed 200,000 shares. Included in the tables below, 17,640
option shares were granted at $12.88 in 1993 and 19,080 option shares were
granted at $10.00 in 1992.


   1993                            SHARES                PRICE
- ----------                        ----------          ----------

5. RESTRUCTURING

During 1991, the company took actions resulting in restructuring charges
totaling $12,251,000 associated with the consolidation and closure of
facilities. Such actions included reductions in work force and consolidation of
product lines required to concentrate on core markets. Charges incurred were
primarily related to severance pay and write-down of assets.


6. OTHER INCOME (EXPENSE)--NET

In 1991 the company received and reviewed various audit reports and claims
asserted by the Defense Contract Audit Agency (DCAA) for contracts completed in
prior years. Although the company believes it has meritorious defenses,
provisions totaling $2,500,000 were recorded for these claims in 1991.


7. INCOME TAXES

In 1992 the company adopted Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 109,
"Accounting for Income Taxes" (SFAS 109) which permits recognition of tax
benefits for certain temporary differences that could not be recognized under
SFAS 96. Under SFAS 109, deferred tax assets are recognized when management
believes realization of future tax benefits of temporary differences is more
likely than not. In estimating future tax consequences, SFAS 109 generally
considers all expected future events other than enactments of changes in the tax
law or rates, whereas SFAS 96 gave no recognition to future events other than
the recovery of assets and settlement of liabilities at their carrying amounts.
The cumulative effect of this accounting change increased deferred tax assets at
January 1, 1992 and first quarter 1992 net income by $5,438,000 or 72 cents per
share. As permitted by SFAS 109, the income tax provision for 1991 has not been
restated. The provision (benefit) for Federal and foreign income taxes consists
of the following (in thousands):

The differences between the effective income tax rate and the statutory Federal
income tax rate are as follows:
                                       1993         1992         1991

                                     ==========   ==========   ==========


Deferred tax changes in 1991 resulted primarily from loss provisions for which
no tax benefit was recognized under SFAS 96. Domestic state and local income
taxes included in selling and administrative expenses totaled $1,257,000 in
1993, $640,000 in 1992, and $265,000 in 1991. Foreign operation amounts
represent less than 5% of totals.

The Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1993 (the Act) became effective on
August 10, 1993. The provisions of the Act did not have a material effect on the
company's deferred taxes or its results of operations.


8. ENVIRONMENTAL REMEDIATION AND OTHER CONTINGENCIES

In 1991, the company completed negotiations with the Environmental Protection
Agency (EPA) for a consent decree, which was subsequently lodged in U.S.
District Court. The agreement requires the company to complete restoration and
thereafter maintain the groundwater quality at the Scotts Valley Plant. In a
separate action, the California Environmental Protection Agency issued a letter
challenging the company's position that the source of subsurface contamination
originated outside of company facilities in Palo Alto and directed the company
to revise its remedial investigation/feasibility study. The state further
directed the company to clean up certain contamination under the company
facilities irrespective of the origin thereof; and to coordinate remedial
efforts among the potential responsible parties cited in a 1988 regional
remedial action order. The company recorded a provision totaling $15,000,000 for
estimated costs to comply with the consent decree on the Scotts Valley Plant
site and for estimated costs necessary to fully investigate, develop, and
implement the remedial actions at the Palo Alto Plant site. The provision was
not reduced by any potential recoveries from insurers or other responsible
parties.

The ultimate cost of restoring the sites cannot be predicted with certainty.
Additional uncertainty exists with the Palo Alto site since the extent of the
contamination and the respective share of each potential responsible party has
not yet been conclusively determined. Technological advances and developments
may also affect the future costs of the restoration efforts. Moreover, the
company will continue to vigorously pursue recovery from its insurers and other
responsible parties. The company believes adequate provisions have been taken to
cover the expected expenditures associated with the known environmental actions
at this time.

In addition to the above environmental matters and pending government claims
discussed in Note 6, the company is involved in various legal actions which
arose in the ordinary course of its business activities. Except for the
provisions noted above and in Note 6, the company believes the final resolution
of these matters should not have a material impact on its results of operations
and financial position.


9. EMPLOYEE BENEFIT PLANS

Profit Sharing Investment Plan--The Watkins-Johnson Employees' Profit Sharing
Investment Plan conforms to the requirements of ERISA and the Internal Revenue
Code as a qualified defined contribution plan. The Plan covers substantially all
employees and provides that the company's contribution equal 9% of the net
pretax earnings and be funded each year. The amount charged to income was
$1,945,000 in 1993, $906,000 in 1992, and $0 in 1991.

Employee Stock Ownership Plan (ESOP)--To encourage employee participation and
long-term ownership of company stock, an ESOP was implemented on January 1,
1991. The Board determines each year's contribution depending on the performance
and financial condition of the company. The Board approved a contribution equal
to 1% of eligible employee compensation for 1993, 1992, and 1991, which resulted
in charges to income of $887,000, $900,000, and $910,000, respectively. The ESOP
is a qualified defined contribution plan under the similar employment and
regulatory requirements as the Profit Sharing Investment Plan.


10. BUSINESS SEGMENT REPORTING

The company operates in three industry segments. Operations in the Electronics
(formerly Defense) segment include the design, development, manufacture and sale
of advanced electronic systems and devices for military, space, and commercial
applications. Operations in the Semiconductor Equipment (formerly Commercial)
segment involve the development, production, sales and service of
chemical-vapor-deposition equipment for the manufacture of semiconductor
products and flat-panel displays. The Environmental Services operations provide
technical consulting services ranging from the exploration, development and
utilization of groundwater resources to the detection and remediation of
contaminated sites.

The U.S. Government is a significant customer for the Electronics and
Environmental Services segments. Hughes Aircraft Company is a significant
customer for the Electronics segment. Sales to U.S. Government agencies and
Hughes Aircraft Company totaled $63,000,000 and $41,000,000 in 1993; $70,000,000
and $28,000,000 in 1992; $71,000,000 and $25,000,000 in 1991, respectively.

                           REPORT OF MANAGEMENT

The consolidated financial statements of Watkins-Johnson Company and
subsidiaries were prepared by management, which is responsible for their
integrity and objectivity. The statements were prepared in conformity with
generally accepted accounting principles and, as such, include amounts that are
based on the best judgments of management.

The system of internal controls of the company is designed to provide reasonable
assurance that assets are safeguarded and that transactions are executed in
accordance with management's authorization and are reported properly. Perhaps
the most important safeguard for shareowners is the company's emphasis in the
selection, training and development of professional accounting managers to
implement and oversee the proper application of its internal controls and the
reporting of management's stewardship of corporate assets and maintenance of
accounts in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles.

Deloitte & Touche, independent auditors, are retained to provide an objective,
independent review as to management's discharge of its responsibilities insofar
as they relate to the fairness of reported operating results and financial
position. They obtain and maintain an understanding of the company's accounting
and financial controls, and conduct such tests and related procedures as they
deem necessary to arrive at an opinion on the fairness of the financial
statements.

The Audit Committee of the Board of Directors, composed solely of Directors from
outside the company, meets periodically, separately and jointly, with the
independent auditors and representatives of management to review the work of
each. The functions of the Audit Committee include recommending the engagement
of the independent auditors, reviewing the scope and results of the audit and

                       INDEPENDENT AUDITORS' REPORT

The Shareowners and Board of Directors
 of Watkins-Johnson Company:

We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Watkins-Johnson
Company and subsidiaries as of December 31, 1993 and 1992, and the related
consolidated statements of operations, shareowners' equity, and cash flows for
each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 1993. These financial
statements are the responsibility of the company's management. Our
responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements based on
our audits.

We conducted our audits in accordance with generally accepted auditing
standards. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material
misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting
the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. An audit also includes
assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by
management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation.
We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.

In our opinion, such consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all
materials respects, the financial position of Watkins-Johnson Company and
subsidiaries at December 31, 1993 and 1992, and the results of their operations
and their cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December
31, 1993 in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles.

In 1992, the company adopted Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No.
109, "Accounting for Income Taxes," as described in Note 7 to the consolidated
financial statements.
