                                    PART I 

ITEM 1. BUSINESS 
(a)  General Development of Business 

     The company's  structure  during 1994 was unchanged from the previous year.
     Since Watkins-Johnson realigned its business between 1991 and 1993, it has
     operated in three principal  business  segments:  semiconductor  equipment,
     electronic products and environmental services.

     At the end of 1994, the environmental services unit was divested. Including
     that  divestiture,  there were no  material  reclassifications,  mergers or
     consolidations  of the company or its  subsidiaries  during the year. There
     were no acquisitions  or dispositions of materials  amounts of assets other
     than in the ordinary course of business during 1994.


(b)  Financial Information about Industry Segments 

     The  company   operated   within  three  industry   segments--semiconductor
     equipment,  electronics,  and  environmental  services.  The  environmental
     services  segment was  divested at the end of 1994.  Financial  information
     about industry segments is included in Note 8 to the consolidated financial
     statements contained in Part II, Item 8 of this annual report on Form 10-K.

(c)  Narrative Description of Business 

     Semiconductor Equipment

     The Semiconductor  Equipment Group  manufactures  chemical-vapor-deposition
     (CVD) equipment.  The company's  atmospheric-pressure CVD equipment is used
     by  semiconductor  manufacturers  worldwide  in the  production  of  memory
     devices (DRAMs) and microprocessors.

     Historically,  the company's  CVD systems have been used  primarily for the
     deposition of interlevel-dielectric  films--the initial dielectric layer on
     a  semiconductor  wafer.  The company's  current  principal  products,  the
     TEOS999 and WJ-1000 Systems, deposit both  interlevel-dielectric  (ILD) and
     intermetal-dielectric  (IMD) layers of film on sub-half-micron  geometries.
     The addition of an IMD capability to WJ's historic concentration on the ILD
     process potentially doubles the market size for WJ's CVD equipment.

     Changing wafer-processing requirements,  involving the addition of multiple
     layers  of both  ILD and IMD to  advanced  integrated  circuits,  are  also
     increasing  the market for WJ systems.  The WJ-1000  System,  designed  for
     high-throughput  CVD onto the 200-mm  (8-inch)  wafers  currently  entering
     production in major  fabrication  facilities in the U.S. and overseas,  has
     been well accepted by the market.

     A variant of  Watkins-Johnson's  semiconductor-production  tool is used for
     manufacturing  flat-panel  displays for  personal-communication,  computing
     and entertainment products.

     Sales by the segment were 43% of  consolidated  sales in 1994,  29% in 1993
     and 22% in 1992. The company is changing its mode of selling  semiconductor
     equipment.  In place of a network  of  manufacturers'  representatives  and
     distributors,   WJ  is  establishing   direct  sales  and  service  offices
     worldwide.

     Customers of the Semiconductor  Equipment Group are numerous. A majority of
     the  segment's  sales  is  to  manufacturers  of  semiconductor  integrated
     circuits.  Marubeni  Hytech,  the  company's  Japanese  distributor,  is  a
     significant  customer  of the  segment.  There  are  several  domestic  and
     international  competitors  and  competition  is  intense.  In meeting  the
     competition,  emphasis is placed on selling  quality  products  having both
     reliability and performance and a strong customer- support network.

     The  Semiconductor  Equipment  Group's  business  depends  upon the capital
     expenditures   of   semiconductor   manufacturers,   and  the  current  and
     anticipated  market demand for integrated  circuits.  It is recognized that
     the  semiconductor  equipment  business is cyclical and can change rapidly.
     Uncertainty   increases    significantly   when   projecting   demand   for
     semiconductor equipment products more than 6 months in the future.

                                1           

<PAGE>

     Electronics

     The Electronics Group manufactures turnkey systems,  integrated  subsystems
     and  signal-processing  components for a broad range of communications  and
     defense-electronics  applications.  The group is serving new customers with
     wireless-communication requirements, in addition to supplying sophisticated
     electronic   products  for   defense-intelligence,   missile-guidance   and
     space-communications missions.

     Recent  non-defense   contracts  include  transceivers  for  cellular  base
     stations,    receivers    for   locating    emergency   911   callers   and
     high-dynamic-range  mixers  for  the  Japanese  manufacturer  of  "personal
     handi-phone" base stations.

     Watkins-Johnson receivers,  antennas and signal-analysis equipment are used
     by  both   commercial  and  military   governmental   agencies  to  perform
     range-monitoring,     frequency-measurement,     signal-localization    and
     interference-analysis  functions,  often  in  complex,  high-signal-density
     environments.

     The company is a subcontractor  for certain key missile  programs,  such as
     the Advanced  Medium-Range  Air-to-Air  Missile  (AMRAAM),  the  High-speed
     Anti-Radiation  Missile  (HARM)  and  the  Standard  Missile  Block 4 which
     continue  to   represent  a   substantial   portion  of  the  group's  core
     defense-electronics business.

     Electronics  Group products are marketed through direct selling efforts and
     distributor  networks.  Sales  by  the  electronics  segment  were  57%  of
     consolidated  sales in 1994, 71% in 1993 and 78% in 1992. A majority of the
     segment  sales is made to  government  agencies and to  customers,  such as
     Hughes Aircraft Company, engaged in defense contracting.  The principal end
     user for such sales is the U.S. Department of Defense. Sales contracts with
     the  government  are  customarily  subject  to terms and  conditions  which
     provide for  renegotiation of profits or termination of the contract at the
     election of the government.  The right to terminate for convenience has not
     had any significant  effect on the company's  financial position or results
     of operations.

     The electronics segment has numerous  competitors which include both large,
     diversified  corporations  and  smaller  specialty  firms.  In  addition to
     pressures from competing companies,  Watkins-Johnson's  defense-electronics
     business is influenced by political activity and national budgetary policy.
     In recent years,  Department of Defense  budget  cutbacks have required the
     company  to reduce  its work  force and  restructure  its  organization  to
     address changing business opportunities. Ongoing reductions in U.S. defense
     spending could limit future demand for the company's products.

     Due to the various  industries  in which the  company  and its  competitors
     operate, a competitive ranking cannot be reasonably  established.  However,
     WJ's  Electronics  Group is a leading  supplier  in several of its  product
     markets.  In meeting its  competition,  the company offers quality products
     featuring both reliability and performance at competitive prices.



     Other Business Items

     Raw materials for the production of semiconductor  equipment and electronic
     products are acquired  from a broad range of suppliers.  Because  suppliers
     are  numerous,  dependence  on any one  supplier  is kept to a minimum.  On
     occasion,  however,  the  failure  of a supplier  to deliver  key parts can
     jeopardize the on-time shipment of WJ products. Business operations are not
     believed to be seasonal. Except for negotiated advance or progress payments
     from customers on long-term contracts in the defense-electronics  business,
     there are no special working capital practices.

     The company has been active in securing patents and licensing agreements to
     protect certain  proprietary  technologies and know-how  resulting from its
     ongoing  research and  development.  The financial  impact of the company's
     efforts  to protect  its  intellectual  property  are  unknown.  Management
     believes that the company's competitive strength derives primarily from its
     core  competence  in  engineering,   manufacturing  and  understanding  its
     customers  and  markets;  therefore,   aggressive  steps  to  protect  that
     knowledge are considered justifiable.

                                2

     Total  company  backlog at December 31, 1994 was  $235,942,000  compared to
     $221,437,000  at December 31, 1993. The percentage of backlog  attributable
     to the semiconductor  equipment and electronics  segments were 39% and 61%,
     respectively,  in 1994, compared to 22% and 78% in 1993.  Approximately 92%
     of all backlog at year-end 1994 is shippable within 12 months,  compared to
     86% at year-end 1993.

     Company-sponsored research and development expense was $34,436,000 in 1994,
     $27,163,000 in 1993, and $27,210,000 in 1992.  Customer-sponsored  research
     and  development  was estimated to be  approximately  $24,000,000  in 1994,
     $18,000,000  in 1993,  and  $25,000,000  in 1992,  and was performed by the
     Electronics Group.

     The  company's  employment  at  December  31,  1994 was 2,220.  None of the
     company's employees is covered by a  collective-bargaining  agreement.  The
     company's relationship with its employees is generally good.

     Environmental issues are discussed in Note 6 to the consolidated  financial
     statements contained in Part II, Item 8 of this annual report on Form 10-K.

(d)  Financial Information about Foreign and Domestic Operations and Export 
     Sales. 

     Assets  and sales  from  foreign  operations  are less than ten  percent of
     consolidated  totals.  Export  sales  and  sales  from  foreign  operations
     accounted for 45% of the company's  sales in 1994,  33% in 1993, and 25% in
     1992.  The  inherent  risks of foreign  business  are  similar to  domestic
     business,  with the additional risks of foreign government  instability and
     export license  cancellation.  A major portion of foreign product orders in
     the  electronics  segment  requires  export  licensing by the Department of
     State prior to shipment.  For international  shipments for both electronics
     and  semiconductor   equipment  segments,  the  company  purchases  forward
     exchange  contracts  and/or  obtains  customer  letters of credit to reduce
     foreign currency  fluctuation and credit risks. For further  information on
     foreign  sales,  see  Note  8  to  the  consolidated  financial  statements
     contained in Part II, Item 8 of this annual report on Form 10-K.

ITEM 2. PROPERTIES 

     Watkins-Johnson  Company and subsidiaries  conduct their main operations at
     plants  in Palo  Alto  and  Scotts  Valley,  California  and  Gaithersburg,
     Maryland.  Additional  operations  are conducted in Windsor,  England.  The
     plant in San Jose, California, has been closed and is offered for sale. The
     company  plans to  close  its  50,000  square  foot  facility  in  Columbia
     (Savage),  Maryland, in the first quarter of 1995 and will return it to the
     lessor.

     At December 31, 1994, there were approximately 530,000 square feet of plant
     space in  California,  225,000  square feet in Maryland,  and 15,000 square
     feet in England. Approximately 95% of the company's plant space is occupied
     for the  company's  operations.  The company is pursuing  opportunities  to
     realize the market value of its properties while ensuring  efficient use of
     available space.

     The electronics  segment  utilizes  substantially  all of the Palo Alto and
     Gaithersburg    facilities.    The   Scotts   Valley   plant   houses   the
     semiconductor-equipment segment.

     The Palo Alto facility and sales office  locations are leased.  Information
     on  long-term  obligations  is in  Note  3 to  the  consolidated  financial
     statements contained in Part II, Item 8 of this annual report on Form 10-K.

ITEM 3. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS 

     Information  required  under  this  item  is  contained  in  Note  6 to the
     consolidated  financial  statements  contained  in Part II,  Item 8 of this
     annual report on Form 10-K.

ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND 
RESULTS OF OPERATIONS 

     Financial Condition:

     The company's  financial  condition  remains healthy.  During 1994 cash and
     equivalents  decreased  $11 million from $45 to $34 million.  Although cash
     flow from operations was positive,  the decline in cash was attributable to
     higher capital expenditures,  repayment of a long-term mortgage, dividends,
     and cash used for stock repurchases exceeding stock issuances.  The company
     expects its  operations  to generate  sufficient  funds to meet next year's
     cash requirements.  In addition, the company has the ability to augment any
     unplanned cash needs with readily available external financing.

     Current Operations:

     The  semiconductor-equipment   business  remained  strong  during  1994  as
     semiconductor  manufacturers  continued to expand their plant capacity. The
     Semiconductor  Equipment  Group  increased its production  capacity to keep
     pace with demand. To better serve its international

                                5           

<PAGE>

     customers,  in 1994 the group established  subsidiary  operations in Japan,
     Singapore and Taiwan in addition to South Korea,  which was  established in
     1993.  Preparations are underway to open an office in Europe in early 1995.
     Although the company  remains  cautious about the  uncertainty and cyclical
     nature of the  semiconductor-equipment  business,  it is  encouraged by the
     group's record  backlog at the end of 1994 and good order  prospects in the
     first half of 1995.

     In  contrast  to  the  burgeoning   semiconductor-equipment   market,   the
     persistent weakness in the defense market prompted the Electronics Group to
     further streamline its operations and reduce costs.  During 1994, the group
     consolidated its two Northern California operations into the company's Palo
     Alto,  California Plant. The group is also planning to consolidate its East
     Coast operations into the  Gaithersburg,  Maryland Plant in early 1995. The
     company  believes these actions should help to improve its  competitiveness
     in the shrinking defense electronics market.

     Furthermore,  the company divested its Environmental business at the end of
     the  year.  The  divestiture  did  not  have a  significant  impact  on the
     company's  results of operation and  financial  position.  The  divestiture
     should allow the company to focus its resources on  high-growth  areas such
     as   the   already   robust   semiconductor-equipment   segment   and   the
     telecommunications market within the electronics segment.

     Results of Operations:

     1994 Compared to 1993: Sales in the semiconductor-equipment  segment surged
     78%  and  more  than  offset  the 6%  decline  in the  electronics  segment
     resulting  in an overall  company  increase  of 18%.  The  favorable  shift
     towards more profitable  semiconductor-equipment products helped to improve
     the  company's  gross  margin  to above  40%  despite  consolidation  costs
     incurred in the Electronics Group. Selling and administrative expenses grew
     faster  than  revenues  because  of  commissions  on  higher  international
     semiconductor-equipment sales. As previously discussed, to improve customer
     service and better control international  expenses, the company established
     certain foreign  operations.  The offices will operate in parallel with the
     current  distributors during a transition period.  Research and development
     expenditures  were  expectedly  higher than last year due to the  company's
     efforts in advancing  high-density plasma technology and development of the
     next generation of products for both business  segments.  The effective tax
     rate  declined  from 31% to 30%  primarily  due to higher R&D credit.  As a
     result of the above factors,  net income from  continuing  operations  rose
     78%.

     1993 Compared to 1992: Semiconductor Equipment Group sales jumped 46% while
     Electronics  Group sales were flat.  Margins improved  significantly in the
     Semiconductor  Equipment  Group due to the higher  volume  and  operational
     efficiencies.  This more than offset the slight  decline in profit  margins
     experienced  in the  Electronics  Group.  As a result,  the combined  gross
     margin improved from 35% in 1992 to 36% in 1993. Selling and administrative
     expenses were higher as expected due to the increase in volume and expenses
     associated with the profitability of the company. In a  percentage-of-sales
     comparison,  selling and administrative expenses were favorable relative to
     1992 but may increase in 1994 due to  anticipated  higher  commissions  and
     expenses  associated  with  certain   international  sales.   Research  and
     development  expenses  decreased  for the first  three  quarters of 1993 as
     activities eased from the intense levels experienced in 1992. In the fourth
     quarter  1993,  the  Semiconductor  Equipment  Group  began to  reemphasize
     research and  development  activities  to focus on the next  generation  of
     products to meet the  time-to-market  window.  The higher level of research
     and  development  expenses  incurred  in the fourth  quarter is expected to
     continue for at least the first half of 1994. All other nonoperating income
     and expenses were within  expectations.  Due to the combined  effect of the
     above factors, 1993 net income more than doubled the 1992 income before the
     cumulative effect of an accounting change.

                  NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 

1. SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES 

Principles of Consolidation--The consolidated financial statements include those
of the company and its subsidiaries  after elimination of intercompany  balances
and transactions.

Cash  Equivalents--Cash  equivalents  consist  principally  of commercial  paper
acquired with  remaining  maturity  periods of 90 days or less and are stated at
cost plus accrued  interest  which  approximates  market  value.  The  company's
investment  guidelines  limit  holdings in commercial  paper to  $1,000,000  per
issuer.

Inventories--Inventories  are  stated  at the  lower  of cost,  using  first-in,
first-out and average-cost basis, or market. Cost of inventory items is based on
purchase  and  production  cost.   Long-term  contract  costs  and  selling  and
administrative  expenses are excluded from inventory.  Progress payments are not
netted against inventory.

Property, Plant and Equipment--Property, plant and equipment are stated at cost.
Leases  which at  inception  assure the lessor full  recovery of the fair market
value  of the  property  over the  lease  term are  capitalized.  Provision  for
depreciation and amortization is primarily based on the sum-of-the-years'-digits
and straight-line methods.

Revenue  Recognition--Revenue  on  fixed-price  contracts  other than  long-term
contracts is recorded  upon  shipment or completion of tasks as specified in the
contract.  Sales and  allowable  fees  under  cost-reimbursement  contracts  are
recorded as costs are incurred.  Long-term contract sales and cost of goods sold
are  recognized  using the  percentage-of-completion  method based on the actual
physical  completion of work  performed and the ratio of costs incurred to total
estimated costs to complete the contract.  Any  anticipated  losses on contracts
are charged to earnings when identified.

Foreign Currency Translation--The functional currency for all foreign operations
is the  U.S.  dollar.  Gains  or  losses,  which  result  from  the  process  of
remeasuring  foreign currency  financial  statements and transactions  into U.S.
dollars, are included in net income and are not material in any year presented.

Income  Taxes--In  1992, the company adopted  Statement of Financial  Accounting
Standard  No. 109,  "Accounting  for Income  Taxes" (SFAS 109);  previously  the
company had  accounted for taxes under SFAS 96 (see Note 5). Under SFAS 109, the
consolidated  statements of income include  provisions for deferred income taxes
using the "liability"  method for  transactions  that are reported in one period
for financial accounting purposes and in another period for income tax purposes.
State  and local  income  taxes  are  included  in  selling  and  administrative
expenses.

Per Share Information--Beginning in 1993, net income per share is computed using
the weighted  average number of common and common  equivalent  shares  (dilutive
stock options) outstanding during the year. The difference between fully diluted
earnings per share and primary earnings per share is not  significant.  Prior to
1993,  the  computation  excluded  outstanding  stock options as their  dilutive
effect was not material.

Reclassification--Certain  amounts for 1993 and 1992 have been  reclassified  to
conform to the 1994 presentation.

2. RECEIVABLES 


Receivables consist of the following (in thousands): 

                                            1994      1993 
                                           ---------- ---------

                                           ---------- --------- 
Total long-term contract receivables  ..... 22,515     23,567 
Other trade receivables ................... 57,912     50,404 
                                           ---------- --------- 
Total receivables less allowance of $1,015 
in 1994 and $999 in 1993 ..................$80,427   $ 73,971 
                                           ========== ========= 

Unbilled  receivables  represent revenue recognized for long-term  contracts not
yet billable based on the terms of the contract. These amounts are billable upon
shipment  of the  product,  achievement  of  milestones,  or  completion  of the
contract.  Unbilled  receivables are expected to be billed and collected  within
one year. Receivables representing retainage not collectible within one year are
not material. There are no significant billed or unbilled receivables subject to
future negotiation.

Government contracts have provisions for audit, price  redetermination and other
profit and cost limitations. Contracts may be terminated without prior notice at
the Government's convenience. In the event of such termination,  the company may
be  compensated  for work  performed,  a reasonable  allowance  for profit,  and
commitments at the time of  termination.  The right to terminate for convenience
has not had any  significant  effect  on the  company's  financial  position  or
results of operations.

3. LONG-TERM OBLIGATIONS AND LINES OF CREDIT 

Long-term  obligations,  excluding  amounts due within one year,  consist of (in
thousands):

                              1994      1993 
                           ---------- --------- 
Mortgage ..................$     0   $  4,238 
Deferred compensation  ....  6,330      4,034 
Environmental remediation    8,430     10,257 
Long-term leases ..........  7,823      7,934 
                           ---------- --------- 
Total .....................$22,583   $ 26,463 
                           ========== ========= 

The current portion of long-term obligations is included in current liabilities.
The  expected  maturity  amounts  are  as  follows:  1995,   $2,947,000;   1996,
$2,072,000; 1997, $1,955,000; 1998, $1,948,000; 1999, $1,942,000.

Mortgage--Primarily  consisted of a mortgage bearing 8 3/4 % interest secured by
the San Jose,  California  plant.  During 1994,  the mortgage was paid while the
property was offered for sale.  Based on the  borrowing  rates  available to the
company for loans with  similar  terms,  the  carrying  value of the mortgage at
December 31, 1993 approximated fair value.

Deferred  Compensation--The  company has deferred  compensation  plans  covering
selected  members of management and key technical  employees.  The purpose is to
reward and encourage talented employees to remain with the company.

Environmental  Remediation--As  discussed in Note 6, the company is obligated to
remediate  groundwater   contamination  at  the  Scotts  Valley  and  Palo  Alto
facilities.  The  portion  expected  to be paid  within one year is  included in
current liabilities.

Leases--Certain  long-term  leases for plant  facilities  are treated as capital
leases for financial statement purposes. The leases expire during the years 2014
to 2029, and renewal options do not provide for lease extensions beyond the year
2029. The company also has noncancellable  operating leases for plant facilities
and  equipment  expiring  through  1998.  The leases may be renewed  for various
periods after the initial term. Payment  obligations under these capitalized and
operating leases as of December 31, 1994 are as follows (in thousands):

Lines of  Credit--The  company  has  arranged  with  certain  banks  to  provide
unsecured revolving lines of credit totaling  $23,500,000.  These agreements are
generally renegotiated on an annual basis. No material compensating balances are
required  or  maintained.  Borrowings  under  these  facilities  generally  bear
interest at prime rate,  which ranged from 6 to 8 1/2 percent in 1994. The lines
of credit were  substantially  unused during the year. The amount of outstanding
letters of credit and other guarantees, which may reduce the company's available
lines, totaled $4,701,000 at December 31, 1994.

4. SHAREOWNERS' EQUITY 

Stock  Repurchase  Program--During  1994,  the Board of Directors  increased its
common-stock-repurchase   authorization  from  1,500,000  to  2,500,000  shares.
Through December 31, 1994, 1,500,000 shares have been repurchased completing the
previous repurchase authorization.  The new authorization enables the company to
continue to acquire its common stock from time to time when appropriate.

Common  Share   Purchase   Rights--For   each  share  of  company  common  stock
outstanding,  one Common Share  Purchase  Right is attached.  The Rights  expire
October 20,  1996,  and may be redeemed by the company for $.01 per Right at any
time  prior to 15 days  after an entity  acquires  20% or more of the  company's
common stock. The Rights become exercisable if an entity acquires 20% or more of
the company's outstanding common stock, or announces an offer which would result
in such entity acquiring

                               13

                    WATKINS-JOHNSON COMPANY AND SUBSIDIARIES
            NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS--(Continued)

30% or more of the company's common stock.  When  exercisable,  the Rights trade
separately  from the common  stock and  entitle a holder to buy one share of the
company's  common stock for $160. If the company is  subsequently  involved in a
merger or other business combination,  each Right will entitle its holder to buy
a number  of shares of common  stock of the  surviving  company  having a market
value of twice the $160 exercise  price.  The Rights also provide for protection
against self-dealing transactions by a controlling shareowner.

Stock  Option  Plans--The  Employee  Stock  Option Plan  provides  for grants of
nonqualifying and incentive stock options to certain key employees and officers.
The options  are granted at the market  price on date of grant and expire at the
tenth anniversary date. One-third of the options granted are exercisable in each
of the third, fourth and fifth succeeding years. The Plan allows those employees
who are subject to the insider  trading  restrictions  certain limited rights to
receive  cash in the  event of a change in  control.  Shares  issued  are net of
retirement  of shares used in payment for options  exercised.  In addition,  the
Plan permits the award of  restricted  stock rights  subject to a fixed  vesting
schedule.  The holder of vested restricted stock has certain  dividend,  voting,
and other shareowner  rights.  No restricted stock awards have been made through
December 31, 1994.

The  Nonemployee  Directors  Stock Option Plan provides for a fixed  schedule of
options to be granted through 1998. Options granted are exercisable similarly to
the Employee  Stock  Option Plan.  The total number of shares to be issued under
this plan may not exceed 200,000  shares.  Included in the tables below,  16,320
option  shares  were  granted at $29.00 in 1994 and 17,640  option  shares  were
granted at $12.88 in 1993.

5. INCOME TAXES 

In 1992 the company adopted Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 109,
"Accounting  for  Income  Taxes"  (SFAS 109) which  permits  recognition  of tax
benefits for certain  temporary  differences  that could not be recognized under
SFAS 96. Under SFAS 109,  deferred  tax assets are  recognized  when  management
believes  realization  of future tax benefits of temporary  differences  is more
likely than not.  In  estimating  future tax  consequences,  SFAS 109  generally
considers all expected future events other than enactments of changes in the tax
law or rates,  whereas SFAS 96 gave no  recognition  to future events other than
the recovery of assets and settlement of liabilities at their carrying  amounts.
The cumulative effect of this accounting change increased deferred tax assets at
January 1, 1992 and first  quarter 1992 net income by $5,438,000 or 72 cents per
share.  The  provision  for  Federal  and  foreign  income  taxes on income from
continuing operations consists of the following (in thousands):

The differences  between the effective income tax rate and the statutory Federal
income tax rate are as follows:

Domestic  state and local  income taxes  included in selling and  administrative
expenses totaled  $1,813,000 in 1994,  $1,257,000 in 1993, and $640,000 in 1992.
Foreign operation amounts represent less than 5% of totals.

            NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS--(Continued)

The Omnibus  Budget  Reconciliation  Act of 1993 (the Act) became  effective  on
August 10, 1993. The provisions of the Act did not have a material effect on the
company's deferred taxes or its results of operations.

6. ENVIRONMENTAL REMEDIATION AND OTHER CONTINGENCIES 

The company remains in compliance with the remedial action plans being monitored
by various regulatory agencies at its Scotts Valley and Palo Alto sites. In 1994
the company  reached  agreement  with the other  potential  responsible  parties
regarding allocations of the remediation costs at the Palo Alto site.

In 1991 the company  recorded a $15  million  charge for  estimated  remediation
actions and cleanup costs. No additional provision has been recorded since 1991.
Expenditures  of $2,727,000,  $1,676,000  and  $1,581,000  were incurred for the
years 1994, 1993 and 1992, respectively. While the timing and ultimate amount of
expenditures  of restoring  the sites cannot be predicted  with  certainty,  the
company  believes that the provision  taken is adequate  based on facts known at
this  time.  Changes  in  environmental  regulations,  improvements  in  cleanup
technology and discovery of additional  information  concerning  these sites and
other sites could affect the estimated costs in the future.

In  addition  to the above  environmental  matters,  the  company is involved in
various  legal  actions  which  arose in the  ordinary  course  of its  business
activities.  Although  the  environmental  provision  was  not  reduced  by  any
potential  recoveries from insurers or other  responsible  parties,  the company
will continue to vigorously pursue such recoveries. Except for the environmental
provision  noted  above,  the company  believes  the final  resolution  of these
matters  should not have a material  impact on its results of  operations,  cash
flows, and financial position.

7. EMPLOYEE BENEFIT PLANS 

Profit Sharing Investment  Plan--The  Watkins-Johnson  Employees' Profit Sharing
Investment Plan conforms to the  requirements of ERISA and the Internal  Revenue
Code as a qualified defined contribution plan. The Plan covers substantially all
employees  and  provides  that the  company's  contribution  equal 9% of the net
pretax  earnings  and be funded  each  year.  The  amount  charged to income was
$3,190,000 in 1994,  $1,945,000 in 1993, and $906,000 in 1992. During the fourth
quarter of 1994, the Board of Directors  approved an amendment to the Plan which
provides  for earnings  contributions  to be replaced  with company  matching of
employees' 401(k) salary deferrals  effective January 1, 1995. Under the revised
plan, the company will match up to 3% of eligible employee compensation.

Employee Stock  Ownership  Plan  (ESOP)--The  ESOP was  established to encourage
employee  participation  and  long-term  ownership of company  stock.  The Board
determines each year's  contribution  depending on the performance and financial
condition  of the  company.  The Board  approved a  contribution  equal to 1% of
eligible  employee  compensation  for 1994,  1993,  and 1992,  which resulted in
charges to income of $894,000,  $887,000, and $900,000,  respectively.  The ESOP
held  204,000 and 185,000  shares of common stock at December 31, 1994 and 1993,
respectively.  The ESOP is a qualified defined contribution plan under ERISA and
the Internal Revenue Code.

8. BUSINESS SEGMENT REPORTING 

The  company  had  operated  in  three  industry  segments.  Operations  in  the
Electronics  segment  include the design,  development,  manufacture and sale of
advanced  electronic  systems and devices for military,  space,  and  commercial
applications.  Operations in the  Semiconductor  Equipment  segment  involve the
development,   production,   sales  and  service  of   chemical-vapor-deposition
equipment  used in the  manufacture  of  semiconductor  products and  flat-panel
displays.  The Environmental  Services  operations provide technical  consulting
services   ranging  from  the   exploration,   development  and  utilization  of
groundwater  resources to the detection and remediation of  contaminated  sites.
This business was divested at the end of 1994 and is reported as a  discontinued
business in the financial statements.

The U.S.  Government and Hughes Aircraft  Company are significant  customers for
the Electronics  segment.  Sales to U.S. Government agencies and Hughes Aircraft
Company totaled $57,000,000 and $35,000,000 in 1994; $60,000,000 and $41,000,000
in 1993; $62,000,000 and $28,000,000 in 1992, respectively. Marubeni Hytech, the
company's Japanese distributor,  is a significant customer for the Semiconductor
Equipment  Group.  Sales  to  Marubeni  Hytech  totaled   $39,000,000  in  1994;
$16,000,000 in 1993; and $7,000,000 in 1992.

                             REPORT OF MANAGEMENT 

The   consolidated   financial   statements  of   Watkins-Johnson   Company  and
subsidiaries  were  prepared  by  management,  which is  responsible  for  their
integrity and  objectivity.  The  statements  were  prepared in conformity  with
generally accepted accounting  principles and, as such, include amounts that are
based on the best judgments of management.

The system of internal controls of the company is designed to provide reasonable
assurance  that assets are  safeguarded  and that  transactions  are executed in
accordance with management's  authorization and are reported  properly.  Perhaps
the most important  safeguard for  shareowners is the company's  emphasis in the
selection,  training and  development  of  professional  accounting  managers to
implement and oversee the proper  application  of its internal  controls and the
reporting of  management's  stewardship of corporate  assets and  maintenance of
accounts in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles.

Deloitte  & Touche  LLP,  independent  auditors,  are  retained  to  provide  an
objective,   independent   review   as  to   management's   discharge   of   its
responsibilities  insofar as they relate to the  fairness of reported  operating
results and financial position. They obtain and maintain an understanding of the
company's accounting and financial controls,  and conduct such tests and related
procedures as they deem necessary to arrive at an opinion on the fairness of the
financial statements.

The Audit Committee of the Board of Directors, composed solely of Directors from
outside the  company,  meets  periodically,  separately  and  jointly,  with the
independent  auditors and  representatives  of  management to review the work of
each. The functions of the Audit Committee  include  recommending the engagement
of the  independent  auditors,  reviewing the scope and results of the audit and
reviewing  management's  evaluation of the system of internal controls.

                         INDEPENDENT AUDITORS' REPORT 

The Shareowners and Board of Directors 
 of Watkins-Johnson Company: 

We have audited the accompanying  consolidated balance sheets of Watkins-Johnson
Company  and  subsidiaries  as of December  31,  1994 and 1993,  and the related
consolidated  statements of operations,  shareowners' equity, and cash flows for
each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 1994.  These  financial
statements   are  the   responsibility   of  the   company's   management.   Our
responsibility  is to express an opinion on these financial  statements based on
our audits.

We  conducted  our  audits  in  accordance  with  generally   accepted  auditing
standards.  Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material
misstatement.  An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting
the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements.  An audit also includes
assessing the  accounting  principles  used and  significant  estimates  made by
management,  as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation.
We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.

In our opinion,  such consolidated  financial  statements present fairly, in all
material  respects,  the  financial  position  of  Watkins-Johnson  Company  and
subsidiaries at December 31, 1994 and 1993, and the results of their  operations
and their cash flows for each of the three  years in the period  ended  December
31, 1994 in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles.

In 1992, the company  adopted  Statement of Financial  Accounting  Standards No.
109,  "Accounting for Income Taxes," as described in Note 5 to the  consolidated
financial statements.
