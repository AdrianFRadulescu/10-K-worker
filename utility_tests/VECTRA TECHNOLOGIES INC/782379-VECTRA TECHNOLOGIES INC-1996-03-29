Former Name if Applicable:

Address of Principal Executive Office (STREET AND NUMBER):
5000 Executive Parkway, Suite 500, San Ramon, CA 94583



<PAGE>

- ------------------------------------------------------------------------------

PART II -- RULES 12b-25(b) AND (c)

- ------------------------------------------------------------------------------

If the subject report could not be filed without unreasonable effort or
expense and the registrant seeks relief pursuant to Rule 12B-25(b), the
following should be completed. (Check box if appropriate)

       (a)  The reasons described in reasonable detail in Part III of this 
form could not be eliminated without unreasonable effort or expense; 
                                                [X] Yes   [ ] No

       (b)  The subject annual report, semi-annual report, transition report
on Form 10-K, Form 20-F, 11-K or Form N-SAR, or portion thereof will be 
filed on or before the fifteenth calendar day following the prescribed due 
date; or the subject quarterly report or transition report on Form 10-Q, 
or portion thereof will be filed on or before the fifth calendar day 
following the prescribed due date; and
                                                [X] Yes   [ ] No

       (c)  The accountant's statement or other exhibit required by Rule

                                                [ ] Yes   [X*] No

                                               * Not Applicable
- ------------------------------------------------------------------------------

PART III -- NARRATIVE
- ------------------------------------------------------------------------------

State below in reasonable detail the reasons why Form 10-K and Form 10-KSB,
20-F, 11-K, 10-Q and Form 10-QSB N-SAR, or the transition report or portion 
thereof could not be filed within the prescribed time period.

The Company is unable to complete its Form 10-K and required financial 
statements at this time without unreasonable effort or expense because of
delays resulting from the Company's high employee turnover and subsequent 
restaffing of its finance department, including a new chief accounting 
officer, controller and accounting manager, in the first quarter of 1996.

- ------------------------------------------------------------------------------

PART IV -- OTHER INFORMATION

- ------------------------------------------------------------------------------

     (1) Name and telephone number of person to contact in regard to this
         notification
              Thomas B. Pfeil                     (510)275-4421
         ----------------------------- ----------------- ----------------------
                    (Name)                (Area Code)      (Telephone Number)

                                     -2-

     (2) Have all other periodic reports required under section 13 or 15(d) of 
the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 or section 30 of the Investment Company Act 
of 1940 during the preceding 12 months or for such shorter period that the 
registrant was required to file such report(s) been filed? If answer is no, 
identify report(s).                           /X/ Yes  / / No


   (3) Is it anticipated that any significant change in results of operations
from the corresponding period for the last fiscal year will be reflected
by the earnings statements to be included in the subject report or portion 
thereof?                                     /X/ Yes  / / No

     If so: attach an explanation of the anticipated change, both narratively 
and quantitatively, and if appropriate, state the reasons why a reasonable 
estimate of the results cannot be made.

The Company expects a significant reduction, in accordance with the 
implementation of FAS 121, to the value of goodwill and other long-lived 
assets reflected on the Company's balance sheet, which will significantly 
reduce the results of operations, intangible assets, other long-lived assets 
and equity. The valuation of the Company's goodwill and other long-lived 
assets has not been completed, so that a reasonable estimate of the results 
cannot be made.
