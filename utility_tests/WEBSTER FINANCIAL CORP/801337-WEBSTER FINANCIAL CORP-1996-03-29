                                     PART I
Item 1.  Business
         --------
General

             Wesbster Financial  Corporation,  ("Webster" or the "Corporation"),
through its subsidiary,  Webster Bank,  ("Webster Bank" or the "Bank")  delivers
financial services to local individuals and businesses.  Webster's Mission is to
build  valuable  banking  relationships  by helping  individuals,  families  and
businesses to reach their financial  goals.  The company has grown profitably in
recent years, primarily through a series of acquisitions which have expanded and
strengthened  its franchise and have  accelerated  Webster's  transition  from a
tranditional  thrift  institution  to a  full-service  retail  bank.  Webster is
organized  along  three  lines of business -  consumer,  business  and  mortgage
banking,  each focused on the special  needs of its  customers.  Webster  serves
275,000  customers from 64 banking  offices in  Connecticut,  extending from the
Massachusetts border to Long Island Sound.

             Webster's  goals are to ensure  customer  satisfaction by providing
superior  customer  service and by  delivering  quality  financial  products and
services,  to  provide a  stimulating  and  challenging  work  environment  that
encourages, develops and rewards excellence, and to make a meaningful investment
in the communities Webster serves.

             Assets at  December  31,  1995 were $3.2  billion  compared to $3.1
billion a year  earlier.  Net loans  receivable  amounted  to $1.89  billion  at
December  31, 1995  compared to $1.87  billion a year ago.  Deposits  were $2.40
billion at December 31, 1995 compared to $2.43 billion at December 31, 1994.

             Prior  to   November  1,  1995,   Webster  had  two  savings   bank
subsidiaries:  First  Federal  Bank, a federal  savings bank ("First  Federal"),
founded in 1935,  with its home office in  Waterbury,  Connecticut,  and Bristol
Savings Bank ("Bristol"),  a state chartered savings bank, founded in 1870, with
its home office in Bristol,  Connecticut.  References  herein to Webster Bank or
the Bank prior to  November  1, 1995 mean  First  Federal,  unless  the  context
otherwise indicates. On November 1, 1995, in the following sequence: (i) Bristol
converted  from a state  savings bank charter to a federal  savings bank charter
and was  concurrently  renamed as Webster  Bank,  (ii) First Federal Bank merged
into  Webster  Bank,  as the  surviving  savings  bank  with its home  office in
Waterbury, Connecticut, (iii) Webster acquired Shelton Bancorp, Inc. ("Shelton")
and its  wholly-owned  subsidiary,  Shelton Savings Bank,  through a merger of a
wholly-owned  subsidiary of Webster formed for such purpose into Shelton, as the
surviving  corporation,  (iv) Shelton then merged into Webster, as the surviving
corporation,  and (v) thereafter  Shelton Savings Bank merged into Webster Bank,
as the  surviving  savings  bank.  References to Webster Bank or the Bank on and
after  November 1, 1995 mean the surviving  bnak in the  transactions  that were
consummated on such date, unless the context otherwise indicates.

             Webster  expanded its banking  operations  by acquiring  Shelton in
1995 and 20 former Shawmut Bank Connecticut  ("Shawmut")  branch banking offices
in the Hartford  banking market in February 1996. See "Shelton  Acquisition" and
"Shawmut  Transaction."  In preceding  years,  Webster  expanded its  operations
through  the  acquisition  of Bristol in 1994 (see  "Recent  Acquisitions")  and
Shoreline  Bank  and  Trust   ("Shoreline")   in  1994  and  the   FDIC-assisted
acquisitions  of First  Constitution  Bank  ("First  Constitution")  in 1992 and
Suffield Bank  ("Suffield")  in 1991. (See "FDIC Assisted  Acquisitions"  1991.)
These  acquisitions have  significantly  expanded the market areas served by the
Corporation.

             On an  unconsolidated  basis at December  31,  1995,  the assets of
Webster  consisted  primarily of its investment in the Bank and $61.8 million of
cash and other  investments.  The principal sources of Webster's  revenues on an
unconsolidated  basis are  dividends  from the Bank and  interest  and  dividend
income from other investments.  See Note 18 to Webster's  Consolidated Financial
Statements for parent-only financial statements.

             The Bank's  deposits are federally  insured by the Federal  Deposit
Insurance Corporation ("FDIC"). The Bank is a Bank Insurance Fund ("BIF") member
institution  and  approximately  at December 31, 1995 63% of the Bank's deposits
were subject to BIF assessment  rates and 37% to Savings  Association  Insurance
Fund ("SAIF") assessment rates. After giving effect to the

                                        3

<PAGE>

Shawmut Transaction, approximately 72% of the Bank's deposits are subject to BIF
assessment rates and 28% to SAIF assessments rates. See "Bank Regulation."

             Webster  as  a  holding  company,  and  the  Bank  are  subject  to
comprehensive regulation, examination and supervision by the OTS, as the primary
federal  regulator.  The bank is also  subject to  regulation,  examination  and
supervision by the FDIC as to certain  matters.  At December 31, 1995, the Board
of Governors of the Federal Reserve System ("FRB") also has regulatory authority
over the Bank as to some matters.  See "Holding  Company  Regulation"  and "Bank
Regulation."

             Webster's   executive   offices  are  located  at  Webster   Plaza,
Waterbury, Connecticut, 06702. Its telephone number is (203) 753-2921

Recent Acquisitions

             The Shawmut  Transaction - On October 1, 1995, Webster Bank entered
into a Purchase and Assumption  Agreement with Shawmut Bank Connecticut National
Association  (now  Fleet  National  Bank  of   Connecticut),   as  part  of  the
Fleet/Shawmut merger, to acquire 20 former Shawmut branch banking offices in the
Hartford Banking Market. The Shawmut Transaction was consummated on February 16,
1996 with  Webster  Bank  receiving  approximately  $845  million in BIF insured
deposits, and $586 million in loans. In connection with the Shawmut Transaction,
Webster  completed  the  sale of  1,249,600  shares  of its  common  stock in an
underwritten  public offering in December 1995. The Shawmut Transaction is being
accounted for as a purchase.  The results of  operations  related to the Shawmut
branch banking offices prior to acquisition are not included in the accompanying
Consolidated  Financial  Statements.  Such results will only be included for the
period subsequent to the consummation of the Shawmut Transaction.

             The  Shelton  Bancorp,  Inc.  Acquisition  - On  November  1, 1995,
Webster  acquired  Shelton and its  subsidiary,  Shelton  Savings  Bank,  a $295
million  asset  savings bank in Shelton,  Connecticut,  with $273 million in BIF
insured  deposits.  In connection  with the merger with Shelton,  Webster issued
1,292,549  shares of its common stock for all the outstanding  shares of Shelton
common stock. Under the terms of the agreement,  Shelton  shareholders  received
 .92 of a share of Webster  common stock in a tax free exchange for each of their
Shelton  common  shares.  This  acquisition  was  accounted  for as a pooling of
interests. The Corporation's Consolidated Financial Statements include Shelton's
financial  data as if Shelton had been combined at the beginning of the earliest
period presented.

             Shoreline  Bank and Trust  Company - On December 16, 1994,  Webster
acquired  Shoreline,  a $51.0  million asset  commercial  bank based in Madison,
Connecticut,  with  $47.0  million  in  BIF  insured  deposits.  To  effect  the
acquisition,  Shoreline  was merged into  Webster  Bank and its Madison  banking
office became a full service  office of Webster  Bank.  In  connection  with the
merger, the Corporation issued 266,500 shares of its common stock for all of the
outstanding shares of Shoreline common stock. This acquisition was accounted for
as a pooling of interests.  The Corporation's  Consolidated Financial Statements
include  Shoreline's  financial  data as if Shoreline  had been  combined at the
beginning of the earliest period presented.


             Bristol Savings Bank - On March 3, 1994,  Webster acquired Bristol,
a state  chartered  savings  bank with $486  million  in assets  which  became a
wholly-owned subsidiary of Webster. In connection with the conversion of Bristol
from a mutual to a stock charter concurrently with the

                                        4

<PAGE>

acquisition,  Webster completed the sale of 1,150,000 shares of its common stock
in related  subscription  and public  offerings.  Webster  invested in Bristol a
total of $31.0  million,  including  the net  proceeds  of  approximately  $21.9
million from  subscription  and public  offerings  plus existing  funds from the
holding company. As a result of this investment, Bristol met all ratios required
by the FDIC for a  "well-capitalized"  savings bank. The Bristol acquisition was
accounted  for as a  purchase.  Results of  operations  relating  to Bristol are
included in the  Corporation's  Consolidated  Financial  Statements only for the
period subsequent to the effective date of the acquisition.  Webster  maintained
Bristol as a separate savings bank subsidiary until November 1, 1995, when First
Federal and Bristol were merged and renamed as Webster Bank.


FDIC Assisted Acquisitions


             Webster Bank  significantly  expanded its retail banking operations
through assisted acquisitions of First Constitution Bank ("First  Constitution")
in October  1992 and  Suffield  Bank  ("Suffield")  in  September  1991 from the
Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation ("FDIC").  These acquisitions,  which were
accounted  for as purchases,  involved  financial  assistance  from the FDIC and
extended  Webster  Bank's  retail  banking  operations  into new market areas by
adding 21 branch  offices,  $1.5 billion in retail  deposits  and  approximately
150,000 customer accounts.  See Note 2 to the Consolidated  Financial Statements
for additional information concerning the terms of these assisted acquisitions.

Lending Activities

             General.  Webster originates  residential,  consumer,  and business
loans.  Total loans  receivable  was $1.9 billion at December 31, 1995 and 1994.
All  references  to loan and  allowance for loan loss balances and ratios in the
Lending  Activities  section  exclude  Segregated  Assets,  which are  discussed
immediately  after this  section.  At December 31, 1995,  first  mortgage  loans
secured by one-to-four  family  properties  comprised 77.2% of the Corporation's
loan portfolio, before net items.

             Nonaccrual  loans,  which include most loans  delinquent 90 days or
more,  were $37.8  million at December  31, 1995,  compared to $34.9  million at
December  31, 1994,  out of a total loan  portfolio,  before net items,  of over
$1.94 billion at December 31, 1995 and $1.93  billion at December 31, 1994.  The
ratio of  nonaccrual  loans to total loans before net items was 1.9% and 1.8% at
December 31, 1995 and 1994,  respectively.  Nonaccrual  assets,  which  includes
nonaccrual  loans and real estate owned were $55.0  million and $61.5 million at
December 31, 1995 and 1994 respectively.

             One-to-Four  Family First Mortgage Loans.  Webster  originates both
fixed-rate  and  adjustable-rate  mortgage  loans.  The  Corporation  originates
one-year,  three-year and five-year  adjustable-rate  mortgage loans (ARMs) with
caps on the annual and lifetime interest rate  adjustments,  which currently are
generally 2% and 6%, respectively.  At December 31, 1995, 63% of Webster's total
mortgage loans before net items were  adjustable-rate  loans.  Interest rates on
adjustable  loans  originated  as of  December  31,  1995 were  2.75%  above the
constant maturity  one-year U.S.  Treasury yield index.  There are no prepayment
penalties  on  any of  Webster's  adjustable-rate  loans.  Webster  has  offered
adjustable-rate  mortgage loans at initial  interest rates  discounted  from the
fully indexed rate.

             Although  adjustable-rate  mortgage loans allow Webster to increase
the  sensitivity of its asset base to changes in interest  rates,  the extent of
this interest  sensitivity  is limited by the interest rate "caps"  contained in
adjustable-rate  loans. The terms of such loans may also increase the likelihood
of delinquencies  in periods of high interest rates,  particularly if such loans
are  originated at  discounted  interest  rates.  Federal law permits the FRB to
promulgate  regulations limiting the maximum interest rate that may apply during
the term of adjustable rate mortgage loans.  Under the current  regulations,  no
specific interest rate limit is set, but lenders are required to impose interest
rate  caps  on all  adjustable-rate  mortgage  loans  and  all  dwelling-secured
consumer  loans,  including  home equity loans,  which provide for interest rate
adjustments.

             Webster  originates  15 to 30 year  fixed-rate  mortgage  loans  on
one-to-four family units. Webster has exchanged  fixed-rate,  long-term mortgage
loans for mortgage-backed

Mortgage  Association  ("GNMA").  At December 31, 1995, $555.5 million or 37% of
Webster's total residential mortgage loans before net items had fixed rates.

               Webster sells  mortgage  loans in the secondary  market when such
sales are consistent with its asset/liability management objectives. At December
31, 1995,  Webster had $2.9 million of adjustable and fixed-rate  mortgage loans
held for sale.

             Webster also makes residential construction loans to individuals to
construct  one-to-four  family  residential  units.  At December 31, 1995,  such
construction  loans  totaled  $54.4  million or 2.8% of  Webster's  total  loans
receivable before net items.

             All of the conventional  mortgage loans on one-to-four family units
originated  by Webster  include a  "due-on-sale"  clause,  which is a  provision
giving  Webster the right to declare a loan  immediately  due and payable in the
event, among other things,  that the borrower sells or otherwise disposes of the
real  property  which is subject  to the  mortgage  and the loan is not  repaid.
Webster actively enforces "due-on-sale" clauses.

             Commercial and Commercial Real Estate  Mortgage Loans.  Webster had
$197.9  million,  or 10.2% of its total loans  receivable  before net items,  in
commercial and commercial real estate loans outstanding as of December 31, 1995,
excluding  Segregated  Assets.  Commercial  real  estate  loans are  secured  by
multi-family residences,  office buildings, retail outlets,  warehouses, land or
other commercial real  properties.  Commercial loans are secured by assets other
than real estate, such as inventory or trade receivables.

              Loans  secured  by   commercial   and   multi-family   residential
properties can involve  greater risks than  single-family  residential  mortgage
lending.  Such loans  generally  are  substantially  larger  than  single-family
residential  mortgage loans, and repayment of the loan generally depends on cash
flow generated by the property.  Because the payment experience on loans secured
by such property is often dependent on successful operation or management of the
security  property,  repayment of the loan may be subject to a greater extent to
adverse  conditions  in the real  estate  market or the  economy as  compared to
one-to-four  family  residential  mortgage  loans.  The  commercial  real estate
business is cyclical and subject to downturns,  overbuilding  and local economic
conditions.

              At December 31, 1995,  $14.9  million of Webster's  $41.8  million
allowance for loan losses was allocated to commercial and commercial real estate
loans.  See  "Management's  Discussion  and Analysis and Results of  Operations"
contained  in the  annual  report to  shareholders  and  incorporated  herein by
reference.  The annual report is filed as an exhibit hereto.  Also see "Business
- --  Lending   Activities  --  Nonaccrual  Loans  and   Delinquencies"  for  more
information  about  Webster's  asset  quality,  allowance  for loan  losses  and
provisions for loan losses.

         Consumer  Loans.  At  December  31,  1995,  consumer  loans were $172.3
million or 8.9% of Webster's total loans receivable  before net items.  Consumer
loans consist  primarily of home equity credit lines,  home  improvement  loans,
passbook  loans and other consumer  loans.  The allowance for losses on consumer
loans was $7.9 million at December 31, 1995.

         Loan  Originations.   Federally  chartered  savings   institutions  are
authorized to originate real estate mortgage loans throughout the United States.
However,  almost all of the real estate mortgage loans originated by Webster are
secured by real estate located in Connecticut.

         Loan  originations  come from a number  of  sources.  Residential  loan
originations  are  attributable  primarily to present  depositors and borrowers,
walk-in  customers,   referrals  from  real  estate  brokers,   builders,   loan
originators and third party  correspondents.  Webster seeks to attract  consumer
loans by direct  advertising and  solicitation of its existing  deposit and loan
customers.

         Federal  regulations provide that real estate loans may not exceed 100%
of the appraised value of the security property at the time of origination. With
respect to home loans originated or refinanced in excess of 90% of the appraised
value of the security property, that part of the unpaid balance that exceeds 80%
of the  property's  value must be insured or guaranteed by a qualified  mortgage
insurance  company.  These  regulations also require an  institution's  board of
directors specifically to approve all loans on the security of real estate which
are not home loans and which at the time of origination  are in excess of 90% of
the appraised value of the security property.

         Webster makes  single-family  conventional  first mortgage loans with a
loan-to-value  ratio of up to 95%. Webster  requires private mortgage  insurance
for 25% of the amount of the outstanding  principal balance of any loan having a
loan-to-value ratio over 90%. If the loan-to-value ratio is between 80% and 90%,
Webster requires private mortgage insurance for 20% of the outstanding principal
balance of the loan.

         Property  securing  real estate loans  originated by Webster is usually
appraised by one of several professionally-qualified, state-licensed independent
appraisers who have been ratified by the Board of Directors of Webster.  Webster
also employs staff  appraisers,  who also must be state licensed.  For all first
mortgage real estate loans,  Webster requires the borrower to obtain title, fire
and extended  casualty  insurance and, where  appropriate,  flood  insurance and
business  interruption  coverage.  Loans are approved by certain  officers  with
specified approval authority.  Loans approved in excess of $500,000 are ratified
by the Board of Directors.

         Purchase  and Sale of  Loans  and Loan  Servicing.  Webster  has been a
seller and purchaser of whole loans and  participations in the secondary market.
During  1995 and  1994,  Webster  originated  residential  mortgages  that  were
transferred  primarily to the Federal National Mortgage Association ("FNMA") for
conversion into mortgage-backed securities.  Webster generally retains the right
to service the  underlying  loans for these  securities.  During  1994,  Webster
securitized some of its owned  residential  mortgage loans into  mortgage-backed
securities  and these  assets  were  reclassified  on  Webster's  balance  sheet
accordingly.  Securitization  limits credit risk and increases  liquidity  since
these securities can be easily sold in the secondary market.

         Loan  servicing on purchased  loans is generally  performed by the loan
seller,  which  retains  a  portion  of the  interest  paid by the  borrower  in
consideration  for the servicing of the loan.  Certain direct costs of servicing
loans for  others,  such as  attorneys'  fees and court  costs  associated  with
collecting  delinquent  loans,  are borne  pro-rata  by the owners of the loans.
Other costs of servicing loans are part of the servicing  institution's  general
operating expenses and vary from period to period,  depending primarily on rates
of delinquency  and resulting  collection  efforts  required of the  institution
servicing the loans.  Because  servicing  revenues  generally are collected when
loan  payments  are  received,  such  revenues  also  vary  with  the  rates  of
delinquency.

         The following  table sets forth  information  as to Webster's  mortgage
loan  servicing  portfolio  at the dates  shown.  The  decrease  of total  loans
serviced for 1995 is primarily due to the sale of mortgage loan servicing rights
on both owned and  non-owned  loans while the 1994 increase is mostly due to the
Bristol and Shoreline acquisitions.

         Webster,  from  time to  time,  has  purchased  whole  loans  and  loan
participations.  The loans and loan  participations  purchased  are  secured  by
property  located in Connecticut and in other areas of the United States.  There
can be  significant  risks  associated  with the  purchase  of loans  secured by
properties located outside a savings institution's local lending territory.  The
purchaser  may be  unfamiliar  with the  local  economy  in the area  where  the
security properties are located and is generally dependent on the loan seller to
service the loan and deal with delinquencies and foreclosures.  Webster seeks to
reduce  such  risks by  underwriting  purchased  loans  using at least  the same
conservative  underwriting  policies as used for locally originated loans; using
underwriting  standards  which  meet the  requirements  of FNMA and  FHLMC;  and
purchasing only loans secured by one-to-four  family owner occupied  residences.
The  Corporation  may also  purchase  insurance  to cover a portion of losses on
purchased loans.

         Fee Income from Lending Activities.  Webster realizes loan origination,
commitment  and  other  fee  income  from  its  lending  activities,   including
non-refundable  application fees and appraisal fees, document  preparation fees,
tax service fees and other  miscellaneous fees which are dependent upon the type
of loan originated.  Webster also receives late payment fees, loan  modification
fees and  servicing  fees  from  existing  loans.  Income  realized  from  these
activities  can  vary  significantly  with the  volume  and type of loans in the
portfolio  and  in  response  to  competitive  factors.  Webster  also  realizes
prepayment  penalties from early  repayment of its fixed-rate  loans  originated
prior to 1983.  Total  prepayment  penalties have declined  significantly  since
1983.  Webster currently does not include a prepayment  penalty clause in any of
its residential mortgage loans.

         Usury  Limitations.  Federal  legislation  first  enacted  in 1980  has
preempted  all state usury laws  concerning  residential  first  mortgage  loans
unless the state  legislature acted to override the preemption by April 1, 1983.
The  Connecticut  Legislature  did not act to override  the federal  preemption.
Connecticut  law  imposes  no ceiling  on  interest  rates on the types of loans
currently originated by the Bank.

         Nonaccrual  Assets  and  Delinquencies.  When  an  insured  institution
classifies problem assets as either  "substandard" or "doubtful," it is required
to establish  general  allowances for loan losses in an amount deemed prudent by
management.  General  allowances  represent  loss  allowances  which  have  been
established to recognize the inherent risk associated  with lending  activities,
but which,  unlike  specific  allowances,  have not been allocated to particular
problem assets. When an insured institution classifies problem assets as "loss,"
it is required either to establish a specific allowance for losses equal to 100%
of the  amount of the asset so  classified  or to  charge-off  such  amount.  An
institution's  determination  as to the  classification  of its  assets  and the
amount of its  valuation  allowances  is  subject to review by the OTS which can
order the establishment of additional valuation allowances.  See "Classification
of Assets" below.

         The following table sets forth certain information  regarding Webster's
loans  (excluding  Segregated  Assets)  accounted  for  on a  nonaccrual  basis,

         Classification of Assets. Under the OTS' problem assets  classification
system, a savings  institution's problem assets are classified as "substandard,"
"doubtful"  or  "loss"  (collectively  "classified  assets"),  depending  on the
presence of certain  characteristics.  An asset is considered  "substandard"  if
inadequately  protected  by the  current  net worth and paying  capacity  of the
obligor or of the collateral pledged, if any. "Substandard" assets include those
characterized  by the "distinct  possibility"  that the institution will sustain
"some  loss"  if the  deficiencies  are  not  corrected.  Assets  classified  as
"doubtful" have all of the weaknesses inherent in those classified "substandard"
with the added  characteristic  that the weaknesses  present make "collection or
liquidation in full," on the basis of currently  existing facts,  conditions and
values, "highly questionable and improbable." Assets classified "loss" are those
considered  "uncollectible"  and of such little value that their  continuance as
assets without the establishment of a specific loss reserve is not warranted. In
addition,  assets that do not  currently  warrant  classification  in one of the
foregoing categories but which are deserving of management's close attention are
designated as "special mention" assets.

         At December  31,  1995,  the Bank's  classified  assets  totaled  $82.6
million,  consisting of $75.8 million in loans classified as "substandard," $6.8
million in loans  classified  as  "doubtful"  and $0  classified  as "loss".  At
December  31,  1994,  the  Bank's   classified  loans  totaled  $106.4  million,
consisting of $97.8 million in loans classified as  "substandard,"  $8.3 million
in loans  classified  as  "doubtful"  and  $300,000  classified  as  "loss."  In
addition,  at December 31, 1995 and 1994,  the Bank had $29.8  million and $45.9
million, respectively, of special mention loans.

         Allowance  for Loan  Losses.  Webster's  allowance  for loan  losses at
December 31, 1995 totalled  $41.8  million.  See  "Management's  Discussion  and
Analysis -- Results of Operations  Asset  Quality and  Comparison of Years ended
December 31, 1995 and 1994,"  contained in the annual report to shareholders and
incorporated  herein by reference.  In assessing the specific  risks inherent in
the portfolio, management takes into consideration the risk of loss on Webster's
nonaccrual loans, classified loans and watch list loans including an analysis of
the  collateral  for the loans.  Other factors  considered  are  Webster's  loss
experience, loan concentrations, local economic conditions and other factors.

         Under the Purchase and Assumption  Agreement with the FDIC,  during the
first five years  after  October  2, 1992 (the  "Acquisition  Date") the FDIC is
required to reimburse the Bank quarterly for 80% of all net  charge-offs  (i.e.,
the excess of  charge-offs  over  recoveries)  and  certain  permitted  expenses
related to the commercial  non-mortgage loans,  commercial real estate loans and
multi-family loans acquired by the Bank.

         During the sixth and seventh years following the Acquisition  Date, the
Bank is  required  to pay  quarterly  to the FDIC an amount  equal to 80% of the
recoveries during such years on Segregated  Assets that were previously  charged
off after deducting certain permitted expenses related to those assets. The Bank
is entitled to retain 20% of such recoveries  during the sixth and seventh years
and 100% thereafter.

         Upon termination of the seven-year  period after the Acquisition  Date,
if the sum of net  charge-offs on Segregated  Assets during the first five years
plus permitted expenses during the entire seven-year period, less any recoveries
during the sixth and seventh year on  Segregated  Assets  charged off during the
first five years, exceeds $49.2 million, the FDIC is required to pay the Bank an
additional 15% of any such excess over $49.2  million.  As of December 31, 1995,
the Bank has received $38.0 million in  reimbursements  for net  charge-offs and
permitted  expenses  from the FDIC.  At December 31,  1995,  the Bank had a $3.2
million  allowance  for  losses to cover  its share of losses on the  Segregated
Assets.

         A detail of changes in the allowance for the Bank's share of losses for
Segregated Assets follows:

Investment Activities

         The Bank has  authority  to invest in various  types of liquid  assets,
including United States Treasury  obligations,  securities of federal  agencies,
certificates  of deposit of federally  insured  banks and savings  institutions,
bankers'  acceptances and federal funds.  Subject to various  restrictions,  the
Bank may also invest a portion of its assets in commercial paper, corporate debt
securities,  and mutual funds whose  assets  conform to the  investments  that a
federally  chartered  savings  institution  is  otherwise   authorized  to  make
directly.  The Bank also is required to maintain liquid assets at minimum levels
which vary from time to time.  See  "Regulation  -- Savings Bank  Regulation  --
Liquidity."

         Webster, as a Delaware corporation, has authority to invest in any type
of  investment  permitted  under  Delaware  law. As a unitary  holding  company,
however,   its  investment   activities   are  subject  to  certain   regulatory
restrictions described under "Holding Company Regulation."

         Webster,   directly  or  through  the  Bank,  maintains  an  investment
portfolio  that provides not only a source of income but also,  due to staggered
maturity dates, a source of liquidity to meet lending  demands and  fluctuations
in deposit flows. The securities constituting Webster's investments in corporate
bonds and notes  generally  are publicly  traded and are  considered  investment
grade quality by a nationally  recognized  rating firm. The commercial paper and
collateralized  mortgage  obligations ("CMOs") in Webster's investment portfolio
are all rated in at least the top two rating  categories  by at least one of the
major  rating  agencies  at time  of  purchase.  One of the  inherent  risks  of
investing in mortgage-backed securities,  including CMOs, is the ability of such
instruments to incur  prepayments  of principal  prior to maturity at prepayment
rates  different  than those  estimated at the time of purchase.  This generally
occurs  because of  changes  in market  interest  rates.  The  market  values of
fixed-rate  mortgage-backed  securities are sensitive to  fluctuations in market
interest  rates,  declining in value as interest  rates rise. If interest  rates
decrease,  as had been the case  during  1995,  the  market  value of loans  and
mortgage-backed   securities  generally  will  increase  causing  the  level  of
prepayments  to  increase.  Except for $8.4  million  invested by Webster at the
holding  company  level at  December  31,  1995 in the  common  stock of certain
entities, Webster's investments, directly and through the Bank, were investments
of the  type  permitted  federally  chartered  savings  institutions.  Webster's
investment  portfolio is managed by its Treasurer in  accordance  with a written
investment  policy  approved by the Board of  Directors.  A report on investment
activities is presented to the Board of Directors monthly.

         The average  remaining life of the securities  portfolio,  exclusive of
equity securities with no maturity,  is 14.1 and 15.1 years at December 31, 1995
and 1994, respectively.  Although the stated final maturity of these obligations
are  long-term,  the  weighted  average  life  generally  is much shorter due to
prepayments of principal.

         The following table sets forth the contractual  maturities of Webster's
securities and mortgage-backed  securities at December 31, 1995 and the weighted

investment  activities.  While scheduled loan repayments are a relatively stable
source of funds, deposit flows and loan prepayments are influenced by prevailing
interest rates, money market and local economic conditions. Webster also derives
funds from FHL Bank advances and other borrowings.

         Webster  attempts to control the flow of funds in its deposit  accounts
according  to its need for funds and the cost of  alternative  sources of funds.
Webster  controls the flow of funds primarily by the pricing of deposits,  which
is influenced to a large extent by competitive factors in its market area.

         Deposit Activities. Webster has developed a variety of deposit programs
designed to attract both  short-term  and  long-term  deposits  from the general
public.  These deposit programs include passbook and statement savings accounts,
club  accounts,  regular and NOW checking  accounts,  money market  accounts and
certificate accounts with short and long term maturities.

         Webster  gathers  retail and  commercial  deposits  through its 64 full
service banking offices.  In 1995,  Webster  introduced Check Card, a debit card
that  can be  used  at  over  12  million  merchant  locations  worldwide.  Also
introduced  was the Webster One account,  a  relationship  banking  account that
affords  customers  the  opportunity  to avoid  fees,  earn more on savings  and
simplify  their  bookkeeping  with one combined  statement when they link all of
their  balances with Webster.  Webster relies  primarily on competitive  pricing
policies and  advertising  to attract and retain  deposits  and also  emphasizes
customer  service  and  convenience.  The Bank's  First Call  telephone  banking
service provides  automated  customer access to account  information and Webster
representatives 24 hours a day, seven days a week.  Additionally,  customers may
transfer funds, inquire about checks and ATM transactions. Its customer services
include  ATM's that  utilize  state-of-the  art  technology,  membership  in the
"Yankee-24" and Cirrus ATM networks and convenient  business hours of operation,
including Saturday hours.  Webster provides automatic loan payment features from
its accounts as well as direct  deposit of Social  Security and other  payments.
Webster has not used brokers to obtain deposits, however, some residual brokered
deposits have been received through acquired banks.

         Webster  charges fees for certain  deposit  account  services and early
withdrawal penalties on its certificate accounts.  These fees offset the cost of
providing  additional  services or are intended to offset the adverse effects of
the withdrawal of funds during periods of rising interest rates.

         Additional  information  concerning the deposits of Webster is included
in Note 8 of the  Consolidated  Financial  Statements  contained  in the  annual
report to shareholders and incorporated herein by reference.

         Borrowings.  The FHL Bank System functions in a reserve credit capacity
for savings institutions and certain other home financing institutions.  Members
of the FHL Bank  System  are  required  to own  capital  stock in the FHL  Bank.
Members are  authorized  to apply for advances on the security of such stock and
certain of their home mortgages and other assets  (principally  securities which
are  obligations  of, or  guaranteed  by, the United  States)  provided  certain
creditworthiness  standards  have been met. See "Federal Home Loan Bank System."
Under its  current  credit  policies,  the FHL Bank limits  advances  based on a
member's assets, total borrowings and net worth.

         Webster Bank uses FHL Bank advances as an  alternative  source of funds
to deposits in order to fund its lending  activities  when it determines that it
can profitably  invest the borrowed funds over their term. At December 31, 1995,
Webster  Bank had  outstanding  FHL Bank  advances  of $383.1  million and other
borrowings in the amount of $170.0  million,  compared with FHL Bank advances of
$370.7 million and other borrowings of $43.7 million at December 31, 1994.

         The following table sets forth certain information as to Webster Bank's
FHL Bank short-term borrowings at the dates and for the years indicated.

Reverse  repurchase  agreements were also transacted  during 1995 as a source of
short term borrowings.  Webster Bank uses reverse repurchase agreements when the
cost of such borrowings is favorable as compared to other funding  sources.  The
average  balance  for the year and the  maximum  amount of  outstanding  reverse
repurchase agreements at any month-end

                                       23

<PAGE>

during  1995  was  $37.8   million  and  $126.9   million,   respectively.   The
weighted-average  interest rate of the reverse repurchase agreements outstanding
at December 31, 1995 was 5.80%. No reverse repurchase agreements were transacted
during 1994.

         Equity  Offering.  In  December  1995,  Webster  completed  the sale of
1,249,600  shares of common stock in an  underwritten  public  offering  raising
$32.1 million of additional capital, net of expenses,  which was invested in the
Bank to facilitate  its  completion of the Shawmut  Transaction  and to have the
Bank remain well capitalized for regulatory purposes.

Bank Subsidiaries

         The Bank is  permitted  to invest up to 2% of its  assets in the stock,
paid-in surplus,  and unsecured  obligations of subsidiary service  corporations
engaged in  certain  activities,  and an  additional  1% of its assets  when the
additional  funds are used primarily for community or inner-city  development or
investment.  In addition, since the Bank meets all applicable minimum regulatory
capital requirements, it is also permitted to invest up to 50% of its regulatory
capital in conforming loans to service  corporations.  At December 31, 1995, the
Bank's direct investment in its service corporation subsidiary totaled $198,583.
As of December 31, 1995, the activities of such service  corporation  subsidiary
consisted primarily of the selling of mutual funds and annuities through a third
party  provider.  The  service  corporation  receives  a  portion  of the  sales
commissions  generated  and rental  income for the  office  space  leased to the
provider.  The Bank also has an operating  subsidiary,  the primary  function of
which is to dispose other real estate owned.

Employees

         At  December  31,  1995,  Webster  had  714  employees  (including  152
part-time  employees),  none of whom was represented by a collective  bargaining
group.  Webster  maintains a comprehensive  employee benefit program  providing,
among other  benefits,  group  medical  and dental  insurance,  life  insurance,
disability  insurance,  a  pension  plan,  an  employee  investment  plan and an
employee stock ownership plan. Management considers Webster's relations with its
employees to be good.

Market Area And Competition

         The Bank is headquartered in Waterbury,  Connecticut (New Haven County)
and conducts  business from its home office in downtown  Waterbury and 64 branch
offices in Waterbury,  Southbury,  Ansonia, Bethany, Oxford, Cheshire, Prospect,
Branford,  Derby, East Haven, Hamden, Madison,  Milford,  Naugatuck,  New Haven,
North Haven,  Orange and West Haven (New Haven  County),  Watertown  (Litchfield
County),  Fairfield, and Shelton (Fairfield County), and Suffield, East Windsor,
Bristol, Plainville,  Terryville, Enfield, Windsor Locks, Berlin, East Hartford,
Farmington, Glastonbury, Hartford, Manchester, New Britain, Newington, Simsbury,
West Hartford,  Wethersfield and Southington  (Hartford County) and Cromwell and
Middletown (Middlesex County).  Waterbury is approximately 30 miles southwest of
Hartford and is located on Route 8 midway  between  Torrington and the New Haven
and Bridgeport  metropolitan areas. Most of the Bank's depositors live, and most
of the properties  securing its mortgage loans are located,  in the same area or
the adjoining  counties.  The Bank's market area has a diversified  economy with
the workforce employed primarily in manufacturing,  financial  services,  health
care, industrial and technological companies.


                                       24

<PAGE>

         The  Bank  faces   substantial   competition  for  deposits  and  loans
throughout  its  market  areas.  The  primary  factors  stressed  by the Bank in
competing for deposits are interest rates,  personalized  services,  the quality
and range of financial  services,  convenience  of office  locations,  automated
services and office hours.  Competition  for deposits comes primarily from other
savings  institutions,  commercial banks, credit unions,  money market funds and
other  investment  alternatives.  The primary factors in competing for loans are
interest rates, loan origination fees, the quality and range of lending services
and  personalized  service.  Competition for origination of first mortgage loans
comes  primarily  from  other  savings  institutions,  mortgage  banking  firms,
mortgage  brokers,  commercial  banks and  insurance  companies.  The Bank faces
competition  for  deposits  and loans  throughout  its market area not only from
local institutions but also from out-of-state  financial institutions which have
opened loan production offices or which solicit deposits in its market area.

         The OTS's  statement  of policy on  branching  by  federally  chartered
savings  institutions,  as recently  amended,  permits a federal  association to
branch into any state or states of the United States and its territories, except
as otherwise prohibited under federal law. The OTS statement of policy expressly
preempts  any  contrary  state  law.   Connecticut   permits   interstate  stock
acquisitions  between Connecticut  depository  institutions,  (i.e.,  commercial
banks,  savings  banks,  and  savings  and  loan  associations)  and  depository
institutions in other states that have adopted reciprocal  legislation,  subject
to the  approval  of the  Connecticut  Banking  Commissioner.  Connecticut  also
permits out-of-state bank holding companies or savings institution  companies in
states  which  have  adopted  reciprocal  legislation  to  acquire  the stock of
Connecticut holding companies or depository institutions. A bank holding company
or savings  institution  holding company in a state which has adopted reciprocal
legislation may charter and operate a de novo Connecticut depository institution
or holding company upon the approval of the Connecticut Banking Commissioner.

         Effective  September 29, 1995, the Riegle-Neal  Interstate  Banking and
Branching Efficiency Act of 1994 ("IBBEA"), amended the Bank Holding Company Act
of 1956 to permit a bank holding  company to acquire a bank located in any state
notwithstanding  otherwise  prohibitive  state law if the  acquisition  does not
result in the bank holding company  controlling more than 10% of the deposits in
the  United  States  or 30% of  deposits  in the  state in which  the bank to be
acquired is located  (unless  waived by the  state).  IBBEA  permits  individual
states to  establish a state  concentration  limit of less than 30% and restrict
the  acquisition  of any in-state  bank that has been in existence for less than
five years.  Effective June 1, 1997, IBBEA will permit an adequately capitalized
bank to merge with a bank in another state and operate the target bank's offices
as  branches,  subject  to  similar  national  (10%)  and  state  (30%)  deposit
concentration  limits and certain  other  conditions,  if the state in which the
target bank is located does not enact legislation between September 29, 1994 and
June 1, 1997 to prohibit interstate merger transactions.  IBBEA also will permit
a bank subsidiary of a bank holding company to act as agent for other depository
institutions  owned by the same  holding  company for  certain  deposit and loan
functions  effective as of September  29, 1995.  The  foregoing  provisions  are
expected  to further  increase  competition  within the  Corporation's  existing
market area.


Holding Company Regulation

                  General.  Under the Home  Owners'  Loan Act,  as amended  (the
"HOLA"),  the OTS has  regulatory  jurisdiction  over  savings and loan  holding
companies.  Webster, as a savings and loan holding company within the meaning of
the HOLA, is subject to regulation, supervision and examination by the OTS.

                                       25

<PAGE>

                  The HOLA prohibits a savings and loan holding  company such as
Webster, directly or indirectly,  or through one or more subsidiaries,  from (I)
acquiring  control of, or acquiring  by merger or  purchases of assets,  another
savings  institution  or savings  and loan  holding  company  without  the prior
written approval of the OTS; (ii) acquiring more than five percent of the issued
and outstanding shares of voting stock of another savings institution or savings
and loan  holding  company,  subject to  certain  limited  exceptions;  or (iii)
acquiring and retaining  control of a financial  institution  that does not have
SAIF  or BIF  insurance  of  accounts.  The  HOLA  allows  the  OTS  to  approve
transactions  that result in the  creation of multiple  savings and loan holding
companies  controlling  savings  institutions  located in more than one state in
both supervisory and  non-supervisory  transactions,  subject to the requirement
that, in non-supervisory transactions, the law of the state in which the savings
institution to be acquired is located must  specifically  authorize the proposed
acquisition,  by  language  to  that  effect  and  not  merely  by  implication.
Restrictions  relating to service as an officer or  director of an  unaffiliated
holding company or savings  institution also are applicable to the directors and
officers  of the  Corporation  and the Bank  under the  Depository  Institutions
Management Interlocks Act, as amended. At the time of First Federal's conversion
to stock form,  Webster  agreed to maintain  the capital of Webster Bank (as the
predecessor to the Bank), at a level consistent with regulatory requirements.

                  On November 1, 1995,  Webster  (which  since March 3, 1994 had
been a multiple  savings and loan holding  company) became a unitary savings and
loan holding  company upon the  consummation  of the merger of First Federal and
Bristol, renamed as Webster Bank. As a unitary savings and loan holding company,
Webster is  generally  not  restricted  under  existing  laws as to the types of
business activities in which it may engage,  provided that the Bank continues to
qualify as a qualified  thrift lender.  See "Bank Regulation -- Qualified Thrift
Lender Requirement."

                  If in the future Webster again becomes a multiple  savings and
loan holding company,  the Corporation and its subsidiaries  would be prohibited
from  engaging  in  any  activities  other  than  (I)  furnishing  or  providing
management services for its savings institution subsidiaries; (ii) conducting an
insurance  agency or escrow  business;  (iii)  holding,  managing or liquidating
assets  owned or  acquired  from  the  institution;  (iv)  holding  or  managing
properties used or occupied by its savings institution subsidiaries;  (v) acting
as trustee under deeds of trust;  (vi)  engaging in any other  activity in which
multiple  savings and loan holding  companies  were  authorized by regulation to
engage as of March 5, 1987;  and (vii) engaging in any activity that the Federal
Federal  Reserve by regulation has determined to be permissible for bank holding
companies under section 4(C) of the Bank Holding Company Act of 1956, as amended
(the  "BHCA"),  unless  the OTS,  by  regulation,  prohibits  or limits any such
activity for savings and loan holding companies.

                  The  activities  in which  multiple  savings and loan  holding
companies  were  authorized  by  regulation  to  engage  in as of March 5,  1987
consisted  of  activities  that  generally  are similar to those  permitted  for
service  corporations of federally  chartered savings  institutions and include,
among  other  things,  various  types  of  lending  activities,   furnishing  or
performing  clerical,  accounting  and internal  audit  services  primarily  for
affiliates,   certain  real  estate   development  and  leasing  activities  and
underwriting  credit life or credit health and accident  insurance in connection
with extensions of credit by institutions or their affiliates.

                  The  activities  that the Federal  Reserve by  regulation  has
permitted for bank holding  companies  under section 4(C) of the BHCA  generally
consist of those  activities that the Federal Reserve has found to be so closely
related to banking or managing or controlling  banks as to be a proper  incident
thereto, and include,  among other things,  various lending activities,  certain
real and personal  property leasing  activities,  certain  securities  brokerage
activities,  acting as an  investment  or financial  advisor  subject to certain
conditions,  and providing  management  consulting  to  depository  institutions
subject to certain conditions.  OTS regulations do not limit the extent to which
savings  and  loan  holding   companies   and  their   non-savings   institution
subsidiaries may engage in activities

                                       26

<PAGE>

permitted for bank holding  companies  pursuant to section  4(c)(8) of the BHCA,
although prior OTS approval is required to commence any such activity.


Federal Savings Bank Regulation

                  General.  Webster Bank, as a federally chartered savings bank,
is subject to supervision and regulation by the OTS. OTS  regulations  generally
provide that savings institutions must be examined no less frequently than every
12  months,  unless  the  savings  institution  (I) has assets of less than $250
million;  (ii) is well  capitalized,  (iii) was found to be well-managed and its
composite  condition  was  found to be  outstanding  (or  good,  if the  savings
institution  had total  assets of not more than $100  million)  during  its last
examination;  (iv) is not subject to a formal enforcement proceeding or an order
from the FDIC or another banking  agency;  and (v) has not undergone a change of
control  during the previous  12-month  period,  and then it must be examined no
less frequently than every 18 months. The Bank also is subject to assessments by
the OTS to cover the costs of such examinations.

                  The OTS is authorized to promulgate  regulations to ensure the
safe and  sound  operations  of  savings  institutions  and may  impose  various
requirements  and  restrictions on the activities of savings  institutions.  The
HOLA  requires  that all  regulations  and  policies of the OTS for the safe and
sound operations of savings  institutions are to be no less stringent than those
established  by the  Office of the  Comptroller  of  Currency  (the  "OCC")  for
national  banks.  The  Bank  also is  subject  to  regulation,  supervision  and
examination  by the FDIC,  in its capacity as  administrator  of the BIF and the
SAIF,  to ensure  the  safety and  soundness  of both the BIF and the SAIF.  See
"Insurance  of Deposits"  below.  The OTS and FDIC may revalue the assets of the
Bank based upon appraisals,  and require  establishment of specific  reserves in
amounts equal to the difference  between such  revaluation and the book value of
the assets.  The OTS and FDIC also are  authorized to promulgate  regulations to
ensure  the safe and sound  operations  of savings  institutions  and may impose
various  requirements and  restrictions on the activities of insured  depository
institutions subject to their jurisdiction.

                  Capital  Requirements.  OTS  regulations  require that savings
institutions  maintain  (I) "core  capital"  in an amount of not less than 3% of
total assets,  (ii) "tangible  capital" in an amount not less than 1.5% of total
assets,  and (iii) a level of risk-based  capital  equal to 8% of  risk-weighted
assets.  Capital standards  established by the OTS for savings institutions must
generally be no less stringent than those  applicable to national  banks.  Under
OTS regulations, the term "core capital" generally includes common stockholders'
equity,  noncumulative  perpetual  preferred  stock  and  related  surplus,  and
minority  interests in the equity  accounts of  consolidated  subsidiaries  less
unidentifiable  intangible  assets  (other than certain  amounts of  supervisory
goodwill) and certain  investments in  subsidiaries  plus 90% of the fair market
value of readily  marketable  purchased  mortgage  servicing  rights  ("PMSRs"),
subject to certain  conditions.  "Tangible capital" generally is defined as core
capital minus intangible assets and certain investments in subsidiaries,  except
PMSRs.

                  In determining total risk-weighted  assets for purposes of the
risk-based  requirement,  (I) each off-balance  sheet asset must be converted to
its on-balance sheet credit  equivalent amount by multiplying the face amount of
each such item by a credit  conversion factor ranging from 0% to 100% (depending
upon the  nature  of the  asset),  (ii) the  credit  equivalent  amount  of each
off-balance  sheet asset and each on-balance sheet asset must be multiplied by a
risk  factor  ranging  from 0% to 200% (again  depending  upon the nature of the
asset) and (iii) the resulting  amounts are added together and constitute  total
risk-weighted  assets.  "Total capital," for purposes of the risk-based  capital
requirement,  equals the sum of core capital plus supplementary  capital (which,
as defined,  includes the sum of, among other items,  perpetual  preferred stock
not counted as core capital,  limited life preferred stock,  subordinated  debt,
and general loan and lease loss allowances up to

                                       27

<PAGE>

1.25%  of  risk-weighted   assets)  less  certain  deductions.   The  amount  of
supplementary  capital  that may be counted  towards  satisfaction  of the total
capital  requirement  may not exceed 100% of core capital,  and OTS  regulations
require  the  maintenance  of a minimum  ratio of core  capital  to total  risk-
weighted assets of 4%.

                  OTS regulations were amended to include an interest-rate  risk
component to the risk- based capital  requirement.  However, the OTS has delayed
implementation of this amended regulation indefinitely. Under the regulation, as
amended,  an institution  would be considered to have excess interest  rate-risk
if, based upon a 200 basis point  change in market  interest  rates,  the market
value of an institution's  capital changes by more than 2%. This new requirement
is not expected to have any  material  effect on the ability of the Bank to meet
the risk-based capital requirement.

                  Capital  requirements  higher  than the  generally  applicable
minimum  requirement may be established for a particular savings  institution if
the OTS determines that the  institution's  capital was or may become inadequate
in view of its particular circumstances.

                  As of  December  31,  1995,  the Bank had a ratio of tier 1 or
core  capital  to  adjusted  total  assets of  5.99%;  a ratio of tier 1 or core
capital to total risk-weighted assets of 12.04%; and a ratio of total capital to
total  risk-weighted  assets of  13.30%.  Webster's  consolidated  shareholders'
equity at December 31, 1995 was $210 million or 6.5% of total assets.  Under the
OTS's prompt  corrective  action  regulations,  as shown above,  at December 31,
1995, the Bank was classified as well capitalized based on its capital ratios.

                  Prompt  Corrective  Action.  Pursuant to the FDIA, the federal
banking agencies established for each capital measure levels at which an insured
institution  is  deemed  to  be  well   capitalized,   adequately   capitalized,
undercapitalized,      significantly     undercapitalized     and     critically
undercapitalized.   Federal  banking   agencies  are  required  to  take  prompt
corrective  action with respect to insured  institutions that fall below minimum
capital  standards.   The  degree  of  required   regulatory   intervention  for
institutions that are not at least adequately  capitalized is tied to an insured
institution's  capital  category,  with  increasing  scrutiny and more stringent
restrictions,  including  the  appointment  of a receiver,  being  imposed as an
institution's  capital  declines.  An insured  institution  that falls below the
minimum capital  standards must submit a capital  restoration  plan and could be
subject to operating restrictions.

                  The prompt corrective  action  regulations are generally based
upon an  institution's  capital  ratios.  Under  the  prompt  corrective  action
regulation  adopted by the OTS, a savings  institution  will be considered to be
(I) "well  capitalized" if the institution has a total risk-based  capital ratio
of 10% or greater, a Tier 1 or core capital to risk-weighted  assets ratio of 6%
or greater, and a leverage ratio of 5% or greater (provided that the institution
is not  subject to an order,  written  agreement,  capital  directive  or prompt
corrective  action  directive to meet and maintain a specific  capital level for
any capital  measure);  (ii)  "adequately  capitalized" if the institution has a
total risk- based  capital  ratio of 8% or greater,  a Tier 1 or core capital to
risk-weighted  assets  ratio of 4% or  greater,  and a  leverage  ratio of 4% or
greater  (3% or  greater if the  institution  is rated  composite  1 in its most
recent report of examination); (iii) "undercapitalized" if the institution has a
total risk-based capital ratio that is less than 8%, a Tier 1 or core capital to
risk-weighted  assets  ratio of less than 4%, or a  leverage  ratio that is less
than 4% (3% if the institution is rated composite 1 in its most recent report of
examination);  (iv)  "significantly  undercapitalized"  if the institution has a
total risk- based  capital  ratio that is less than 6%, a Tier 1 or core capital
to risk-weighted  assets ratio that is less than 3%, or a leverage ratio that is
less than 3%; and (v)  "critically  undercapitalized"  if the  institution has a
ratio of tangible  equity to total  assets that is less than or equal to 2%. The
prompt  corrective  action  regulations  also permit the OTS to determine that a
savings  institution  should be  classified in a lower  category  based on other
information, such as the institution's examination report, after written notice.

                                       28

                  An institution that is not well capitalized is prohibited from
accepting   deposits  through  a  deposit  broker.  An  adequately   capitalized
institution  ,  however,  can apply for a waiver  to accept  brokered  deposits.
Institutions  that  receive  a waiver  are  subject  to  limits  on the rates of
interest they may pay on brokered  deposits.  Undercapitalized  institutions are
prohibited   from   offering   rates  of  interest  on  insured   deposits  that
significantly exceed the prevailing rate in their normal market area or the area
in which the deposits would  otherwise be accepted.  Institutions  classified as
undercapitalized  are precluded from  increasing  their assets,  acquiring other
institutions,  establishing  additional  branches,  or  engaging in new lines of
business without an approved capital plan and an agency  determination that such
actions  are  consistent  with the  plan.  Institutions  that are  significantly
undercapitalized  may be required to take one or more of the following  actions:
(I)  raise  additional  capital  so that  the  institution  will  be  adequately
capitalized;  (ii) be acquired  by, or combined  with,  another  institution  if
grounds  exist  for   appointing  a  receiver;   (iii)  refrain  from  affiliate
transactions;  (iv)  limit  the  amount  of  interest  paid on  deposits  to the
prevailing rates of interest in the region where the institution is located; (v)
further restrict asset growth;  (vi) hold a new election for directors,  dismiss
any director or senior executive  officer who held office for more than 180 days
immediately before the institution became undercapitalized,  or employ qualified
senior  executive  officers;  (vii) stop accepting  deposits from  correspondent
depository institutions;  and (viii) divest or liquidate any subsidiary that the
OTS determines is a significant risk to the institution.

                  Critically   undercapitalized   institutions  are  subject  to
additional  restrictions.  No later  than 90 days  after a  savings  institution
becomes  critically  undercapitalized,  the  Director  of the OTS is required to
appoint a  conservator  or receiver  for the  institution,  unless the  Director
determines,  with the  concurrence  of the FDIC,  that other action would better
achieve the purpose of prompt  corrective  action.  The Director  also must make
periodic  redeterminations that the alternative action continues to be justified
no less  frequently  than every 90 days.  The  Director is required to appoint a
receiver if the  institution  remains  critically  undercapitalized  nine months
later, unless the institution is in compliance with an approved capital plan and
the OTS and FDIC certify that the institution is viable.

                  Any company that  controls an  "undercapitalized"  institution
must  guarantee  that the  institution  will  comply  with the plan and  provide
appropriate  assurances of  performance  in connection  with the submission of a
capital restoration plan by the depository institution.  The aggregate liability
of any such controlling  company under such guaranty is limited to the lesser of
(I) 5% of the institution's  assets at the time it became  undercapitalized;  or
(ii) the amount  necessary to bring the institution  into capital  compliance at
the time the institution fails to comply with the terms of its capital plan.

                  Safety and Soundness Guidelines.  The federal banking agencies
have  prescribed  safety  and  soundness  guidelines  relating  to (I)  internal
controls,   information   systems,   and  internal  audit  systems;   (ii)  loan
documentation; (iii) credit underwriting; (iv) interest rate exposure; (v) asset
growth;  and (vi)  compensation and benefit  standards for officers,  directors,
employees and principal  shareholders.  Such guidelines  impose  standards based
upon an institution's asset quality and earnings. The guidelines are intended to
set out standards that the agencies will use to identify and address problems at
institutions  before  capital  becomes  impaired.  Institutions  are required to
establish  and  maintain  a  system  to  identify  problem  assets  and  prevent
deterioration  of those  assets in a manner  commensurate  with its size and the
nature and scope of their operations.  Furthermore,  institutions must establish
and maintain a system to evaluate and monitor  earnings and ensure that earnings
are  sufficient  to  maintain   adequate   capital  and  reserves  in  a  manner
commensurate with their size and the nature and scope of its operation.

                  Under the  guidelines,  an institution not meeting one or more
of the safety and  soundness  guidelines  is required to file a compliance  plan
with the appropriate  federal banking agency.  In the event that an institution,
such as the Bank,  were to fail to submit an acceptable  compliance plan or fail
in any material respect to implement an accepted compliance plan within the

                                       29

<PAGE>

time  allowed by the agency,  the  institution  would be required to correct the
deficiency and the  appropriate  federal agency would also be authorized to: (I)
restrict  asset  growth;  (2) require the  institution  to increase its ratio of
tangible  equity  to  assets;  (3)  restrict  the  rates  of  interest  that the
institution  may pay; or (4) take any other  action that would  better carry out
the purpose of the corrective  action.  The Bank was in compliance with all such
guidelines as of December 31, 1995.

                  Qualified Thrift Lender Requirement.  The Bank is deemed to be
a  "qualified   thrift  lender"  ("QTL")  as  long  as  its  "qualified   thrift
investments"  continue  to equal or exceed  65% of its  "portfolio  assets" on a
monthly  average  basis  in  nine  out of  every  12  months.  Qualified  thrift
investments   generally  consist  of  (I)  various  housing  related  loans  and
investments   (such  as  residential   construction  and  mortgage  loans,  home
improvement  loans,  mobile home loans,  home equity  loans and  mortgage-backed
securities), (ii) certain obligations of the FDIC (including the Federal Savings
and Loan Insurance Corporation and the Resolution Trust Corporation),  and (iii)
shares of stock issued by any FHLB,  the Federal Home Loan Mortgage  Corporation
or the Federal National Mortgage Corporation.  In addition, the following assets
may be  categorized as qualified  thrift  investments in an amount not to exceed
20% in the  aggregate  of  portfolio  assets:  (I) 50% of the  dollar  amount of
residential  mortgage loans  originated and sold within 90 days of  origination;
(ii)  investments in securities of a service  corporation  that derives at least
80% of its income  from  residential  housing  finance;  (iii) 200% of loans and
investments  made to acquire,  develop or  construct  starter  homes or homes in
credit needy areas,  subject to certain conditions;  (iv) loans for the purchase
or  construction  of churches,  schools,  nursing homes and  hospitals;  and (v)
consumer loans (in an amount up to 20% of portfolio assets). For purposes of the
QTL test,  the term  "portfolio  assets" means the savings  institution's  total
assets minus goodwill and other intangible assets, the value of property used by
the savings  institution to conduct its business,  and liquid assets held by the
savings institution in an amount up to 20% of its total assets.

                  OTS  regulations  provide  that any savings  institution  that
fails to meet the  definition  of a QTL must either  convert to a bank  charter,
other  than a  savings  bank  charter,  or  limit  its  future  investments  and
activities  (including  branching and payments of dividends) to those  permitted
for both savings  institutions and national banks.  Further,  within one year of
the loss of QTL status, a holding company of a savings institution that does not
convert to a bank  charter must  register as a bank holding  company and will be
subject to all statutes  applicable to bank holding companies.  In order for the
Bank to exercise the powers granted to federally chartered savings  institutions
and  maintain  full  access to Federal  Home Loan Bank  advances,  The Bank must
continue to meet the definition of a QTL.  Webster Bank qualifies as a QTL under
the current test.

                  Insurance  of  Deposits.  Deposit  accounts  at the  Bank  are
insured by the FDIC up to a maximum of $100,000 per insured depositor.  The Bank
is a BIF member  institution with  approximately 63% of its deposits assessed at
BIF premium rates and  approximately  37% at SAIF rates as of December 31, 1995.
Deposit insurance premiums are paid to the FDIC on a quarterly basis.

                  The  FDIC  has  established  a  risk-based  deposit  insurance
premium  assessment system,  pursuant to which BIF and SAIF member  institutions
both  pay  deposit   insurance   assessment   rates,   depending   on  the  risk
classification  assigned to each  institution.  The FDIC places each institution
into one of nine  assessment  risk  classifications  based on the  institution's
capital and supervisory classification.

                  Deposit insurance premiums for the BIF and the SAIF are set to
facilitate each fund achieving its designated reserve ratio. In August 1995, the
FDIC  determined  that the BIF had achieved  its  designated  reserve  ratio and
lowered  BIF  deposit   insurance   premium  rates  for  all  but  the  riskiest
institutions. Effective January 1, 1996, BIF deposit insurance premiums for well
capitalized  banks were further  reduced to the statutory  minimum of $2,000 per
institution  per  year.  Because  the  SAIF  remains   significantly  below  its
designated reserve ratio, SAIF deposit

                                       30

<PAGE>

insurance  premiums were not reduced and remain at 0.23% to 0.31% of deposits on
an annual basis, based upon an institution's supervisory evaluations and capital
levels.

                  The current  financial  condition  of the SAIF has resulted in
proposed  legislation  to  recapitalize  the SAIF  through  a  one-time  special
assessment  (held by an  institution of  approximately  80 cents to 85 cents per
$100 of  assessable  SAIF  deposits  as of March 31,  1995,  subject  to certain
limited  adjustments).  If the  special  assessment  is  enacted,  the  one-time
assessment would apply to approximately $882 million of assessable SAIF deposits
at The Bank.  Certain  adjustments to the special  assessment  applicable to the
Bank have been proposed that will reduce the amount of the special assessment by
20 percent.  The Bank qualifies for a proposed  adjustment,  because on June 30,
1995,  less than 50  percent of The Bank's  deposits  were  insured by the SAIF.
After the special  assessment,  if SAIF achieves its  designated  reserve ratio,
SAIF premium rates would then become the same as BIF rates. Proposed legislation
also  contemplates  a merger  of the SAIF  into the  BIF,  which  would  require
separate  legislation.  The Bank is  unable  to  predict  whether  the  proposed
legislation will be enacted or the amount or the precise retroactive date of any
one-time assessment or the deposit insurance premium rates that would ultimately
apply to assessable SAIF deposits.

                  Legislation  also has been proposed  that could  eliminate the
federal savings institution  charter.  If such legislation is enacted,  The Bank
would be  required  to convert  its  federal  savings  bank  charter to either a
national  bank  charter  or to a  Connecticut  depository  institution  charter.
Pending legislation may provide relief as to recapture of the bad debt deduction
for  federal  tax  purposes  that  otherwise  would  be  applicable  if The Bank
converted its savings bank charter to a commercial  bank charter,  provided that
The Bank meets a proposed  residential  loan  origination  requirement.  Pending
legislation also may result in Webster becoming regulated at the holding company
level by the Federal  Reserve rather than by the OTS.  Regulation by the Federal
Reserve could  subject  Webster to capital  requirements  that are not currently
applicable to Webster as a holding  company under OTS  regulation and may result
in statutory limitations on the type of business activities in which Webster may
engage at the holding company level, which business activities currently are not
restricted.  Webster  is unable to  predict  whether  such  legislation  will be
enacted or, if enacted, whether it will contain relief as to bad debt deductions
previously taken.

                  FDIC  insurance  of deposits  may be  terminated  by the FDIC,
after notice and  hearing,  upon a finding by the FDIC that the insured bank has
engaged in unsafe or unsound practices,  or is in an unsafe or unsound condition
to continue operations, or has violated any applicable law, regulation, order or
condition  imposed by, or written  agreement  with, the FDIC.  Additionally,  if
insurance  termination  proceedings  are initiated  against a bank, the FDIC may
temporarily  suspend insurance on new deposits received by the institution under
certain circumstances.


                  Capital Distributions.  An OTS rule imposes limitations on all
capital  distributions  by  savings  institutions  (including  dividends,  stock
repurchases and cash-out mergers). Under the current rule, a savings institution
is  classified  as a  tier 1  institution,  a  tier  2  institution  or a tier 3
institution,  depending on its level of regulatory capital both before and after
giving effect to a proposed capital distribution. Under a proposed rule, the OTS
would conform its three classifications to the five capital  classifications set
forth  under the prompt  corrective  action  regulations.  Under such  proposal,
institutions that are at least adequately capitalized would still be required to
provide  prior  notice.   Well  capitalized   institutions  could  make  capital
distributions  without  prior  regulatory  approval in specified  amounts in any
calendar year.

                  A tier 1 institution  (i.e.,  one that both before and after a
proposed  capital  distribution  has net  capital  equal to or in  excess of its
capital  requirements  may,  subject to any  otherwise  applicable  statutory or
regulatory  requirements or agreements  entered into with the  regulators,  make
capital  distributions in any calendar year up to 100% of its net income to date
during the calendar

                                       31
<PAGE>
year plus the amount that would reduce by one-half its "surplus  capital  ratio"
(ie., the percentage by which the institution's  capital-to-assets ratio exceeds
the ratio of its fully  phased-in  capital  requirement  to its  assets)  at the
beginning  of  the  calendar  year.  No  regulatory   approval  of  the  capital
distribution is required, but prior notice must be given to the OTS.

                A tier 2  institution  (ie.,  one that both  before  and after a
proposed  capital  distribution  has net  capital  equal to its  then-applicable
minimum capital  requirement but which fails to meet its fully phased-in capital
requirement either before or after the distribution) may, after prior notice but
without the approval of the OTS, make capital distributions of up to: (1) 75% of
its net income over the most  recent four  quarter  period if it  satisfies  the
risk-based  capital  standard  applicable  to it as of January 1, 1993  computed
based on its  current  portfolio;  or (ii) 50% of its net  income  over the most
recent four  quarter  period if it satisfies  the  risk-based  capital  standard
applicable to it as of January 1, 1991 computed based on its current  portfolio.
In calculating an institution's permissible percentage of capital distributions,
previous  distributions  made during the previous  four  quarter  period must be
included.  Tier 2 institutions  may not make capital  distributions in excess of
the above limitations without the prior written approval of the OTS.

                  A tier 3 institution  (ie.,  one that either before or after a
proposed capital  distribution fails to meet As then-applicable  minimum capital
requirement)  may not make any capital  distributions  without the prior written
approval  of the OTS.  In  addition,  the OTS may  prohibit a  proposed  capital
distribution,  which would otherwise be permitted by the regulation,  if the OTS
determines  that  such  distribution  would  constitute  an  unsafe  or  unsound
practice.  Also,  an  institution  meeting  the tier 1  criteria  which has been
notified that it needs more than normal  supervision will be treated as a tier 2
or tier 3 institution, unless the OTS deems otherwise.

                  The FDIA further prohibits an insured  depository  institution
from declaring any dividend, making any other capital distribution,  or paying a
management  fee to a  controlling  person  if,  following  the  distribution  or
payment, the institution would be classified as undercapitalized,  significantly
undercapitalized  or  critically  undercapitalized.  For  purposes  of the OTS's
capital  distribution  regulation,  The Bank was treated as a tier 1 institution
and had  approximately  $85.1 million  available  under such  regulation for the
payment of dividends as of December 31, 1995.

                  Community  Reinvestment Act. Under the Community  Reinvestment
Act (the "CRA") and the implementing OTS regulations, which were amended in 1995
to provide for a performancebased evaluation system, a savings institution has a
continuing and affirmative obligation to help meet the credit needs of its local
communities,  including low and moderate-income  neighborhoods,  consistent with
the safe and sound operation of the  institution.  The CRA requires the board of
directors of savings  institutions,  such as the Bank,  to adopt a CRA statement
for each assessment area that, among other things, describes its efforts to help
meet  community  credit  needs  and  the  specific  types  of  credit  that  the
institution  is willing to  extend.  In  connection  with its  examination  of a
savings institution,  the OTS is required to take into account the institution's
record of meeting the credit needs of its  community in  determining  whether to
grant  approval  for  certain  types  of  applications   including  mergers  and
acquisitions. The Bank's current CRA rating is "outstanding".

                  Liquidity.  Federal  savings  banks,  such  as the  Bank,  are
required to maintain an average daily balance of liquid assets  (including cash,
certain time deposits,  certain  bankers'  acceptances,  certain  corporate debt
securities and highly rated commercial paper, securities of certain mutual funds
and specified  United States  government,  state or federal agency  obligations)
equal to a  monthly  average  of not less  than a  specified  percentage  of the
average daily balance of the savings  institution's  net  withdrawable  deposits
plus short-term borrowings under OTS regulations. This liquidity requirement may
be changed from time to time by the OTS to any amount  within the range of 4% to
10%  depending  upon  economic'  conditions  and the  deposit  flows  of  member
institutions,  and currently is 5.0%. OTS regulations  also require each savings
institution to maintain an average daily balance of short-term  liquid assets at
a specified percentage (currently
                                                        

                                       32


<PAGE>


1%) of the total of the average daily balance of its net  withdrawable  deposits
and short-term borrowings. At December 31, 1995, the Bank was in compliance with
these liquidity requirements.

                  Loans to One Borrower  Limitations.  Savings institutions must
generally  comply  with the loans-  to-one-borrower  limitations  applicable  to
national banks pursuant to HOLA.  National banks generally may not make loans to
a single  borrower in excess of 15% of their  unimpaired  capital and unimpaired
surplus, plus an additional 10% of unimpaired capital and unimpaired surplus for
loans secured by readily  marketable  collateral  (which,  as defined,  does not
include  real  property).  The  HOLA  provides  exceptions  from  the  generally
applicable  national  bank limits,  under which a savings  institution  may make
loans to one  borrower  in excess  of such  limits  under  one of the  following
circumstances:  (I) for any purpose, in any amount not to exceed $500,000;  (ii)
to develop  domestic  residential  housing units, in an amount not to exceed the
lesser of $30 million or 30% of the savings institution's unimpaired capital and
unimpaired surplus, provided other conditions are satisfied; or (iii) to finance
the sale of real property which it owns as a result of foreclosure, in an amount
not to exceed 50% of the savings institution's unimpaired capital and unimpaired
surplus.  Pursuant to its  authority to impose more  stringent  requirements  on
savings institutions to protect safety and soundness,  the OTS has promulgated a
rule  limiting  loans to one  borrower  to  finance  the  sale of real  property
acquired in satisfaction of debts to 15% of unimpaired capital and surplus.  The
rule provides that purchase money mortgages received by a savings institution to
finance the sale of such real property do not constitute  "loans"  (provided the
savings  institution is not placed in a more  detrimental  position  holding the
note than  holding  the real  estate)  and,  therefore,  are not  subject to the
loans-to-one-borrower limitation. At December 31, 1995, under the lending limits
established by HOLA, the maximum amount that the Bank could lend to one borrower
was, in general, limited to $ 28.9 million.

                  Commercial  Loans.  The Bank is  authorized to invest in loans
for commercial, corporate, business or agricultural purposes in an amount not to
exceed 10% of its total assets under the HOLA. At December 31, 1995,  The Bank's
commercial loan portfolio was within the amount permitted by this limitation.

                  Commercial  Real  Property  Loans.  The  aggregate  amount  of
commercial mortgage loans that a federal savings institution may make may not be
in excess of 400% of the savings institution's capital pursuant to the HOLA. The
revised limit,  however, does not require the divestiture of loans made prior to
enactment of the FIRREA in 1989.  The OTS has the authority to grant  exceptions
to the limit if the  additional  amount will not pose a significant  risk to the
safe or sound operation of the savings institution  involved,  and is consistent
with prudent  operating  practices.  At December 31, 1995, the Bank's commercial
mortgage loan portfolio was within the amount permitted by this limitation.

                Limitation  on Certain  Investments.  As a  federally  chartered
savings institution, the Bank is generally prohibited from investing directly in
equity  securities and real estate (other than that used for offices and related
facilities  or  acquired  through,  or in lieu  of,  foreclosure  or on  which a
contract  purchaser has defaulted).  In addition,  the HOLA limits the aggregate
investment by savings  institutions in certain  investments,  including  service
corporations.  At  December  31,  1995,  the Bank was in  compliance  with  such
requirements and limitations.

                  Activities of Subsidiaries.  A savings  institution seeking to
establish a new subsidiary,  acquire control of an existing company (after which
it would be a subsidiary),  or conduct a new activity through a subsidiary, must
provide  30 days  prior  notice  to the  FDIC  and to the OTS  and  conduct  any
activities of the subsidiary in accordance  with  regulations  and orders of the
OTS. Moreover,  the OTS has the power to require a savings institution to divest
any subsidiary or terminate any activity  conducted by a subsidiary that the OTS
determines is a serious threat to the financial  safety,  soundness or stability
of such savings  institution  or is otherwise  inconsistent  with sound  banking
practices.

                  Transactions   with  Affiliates   Restrictions.   Transactions
engaged in by a savings  institution or one of its subsidiaries  with affiliates
of the savings  institution  generally are subject to the affiliate  transaction
restrictions contained in Sections 23A and 23B of the Federal Reserve Act in the
same manner and to the same extent as such  restrictions  apply to  transactions
engaged in by a member bank or one of its  subsidiaries  with affiliates -of the
member bank.  Section 23A of the Federal  Reserve Act imposes both  quantitative
and qualitative  restrictions on transactions engaged in by a member bank or one
of its subsidiaries with an affiliate,  while Section 23B of the Federal Reserve
Act requires,  among other things that all  transactions  with  affiliates be on
terms  substantially  the same,  and at least as favorable to the member bank or
its  subsidiary,  as the terms  that would  apply to, or would be offered  in, a
comparable transaction with an unaffiliated party.  Exemptions from, and waivers
of, the  provisions  of Sections  23A and 23B of the Federal  Reserve Act may be
granted only by the Federal  Reserve.  The HOLA and OTS regulations  promulgated
thereunder  contain  other  restrictions  on loans  and  extension  of credit to
affiliates,  and the  Director  of the OTS is  authorized  to impose  additional
restrictions  on transactions  with  affiliates if the Director  determines such
restrictions  are  necessary  to ensure the safety and  soundness of any savings
institution.  Current OTS regulations are similar to Sections 23A and 23B of the
Federal Reserve Act.

                    Regulatory   Revision.,   Each  federal  banking  agency  is
required to implement a  comprehensive  review of its  regulations  to eliminate
duplicative,  unduly  burdensome and unnecessary  regulations in accordance with
the Community Development and Regulatory Improvement Act of 1994 (the "Community
Development  Act"),  The  OTS has  announced  that  it  will  review  each of Rs
regulations to determine if: (1) the regulation is current;  (ii) the regulation
could be  eliminated  without  endangering  safety  and  soundness,  diminishing
consumer protection or violating statutory requirements;  (iii) the regulation's
subject matter is more suited for a policy statement or handbook guidance;  (iv)
the regulation is consistent  with the  regulation of the other federal  banking
agencies; and (v) the regulation is easily understood. Based upon the first part
of this review,  in late 1995,  the OTS formally  deleted  eight  percent of its
regulations including outdated, duplicative and otherwise necessary regulations.

                    The  OTS  also  issued  a  notice  of  proposed   rulemaking
concerning a comprehensive  revision to its  regulations  and policy  statements
concerning   lending  and   investments.   Under  the   proposal   certain  loan
documentation  requirements  will be  replaced by general  safety and  soundness
standards,  commercial loans made by a service corporation will be exempted from
an institution's  overall ten percent limit on commercial  loans; an institution
will be able to use its own cost-of-funds  index in structuring  adjustable rate
mortgages,  and the 35% of assets  limitation  on credit  card  lending  will be
eliminated.  The OTS has announced that it expects to issue  proposals that will
reduce the burdens  imposed by its  regulations  governing,  among other things,
subsidiaries,  corporate  governance  and  preemption.  Similarly,  the FDIC has
issued a notice of opportunity  for comment with respect to its review of all of
its regulations and written policies.

Federal Reserve System

                    Savings  institutions  are  required to maintain  nonearning
reserves against their transaction  accounts (primarily NOW and regular checking
accounts) and nonpersonal time deposits (those which are transferable or held by
a person  other than a natural  person)  with an original  maturity of less than
1-1/2 years under certain Federal Reserve regulation.  At December 31, 1995, The
Bank was in compliance  with these  requirements.  These reserves may be used to
satisfy  liquidity  requirements  imposed by the OTS. Because required  reserves
must be maintained in the form of vault cash or a noninterest-bearing account at
a Federal Reserve bank, the effect of this reserve  requirement is to reduce the
amount of the institution's interest-earning assets.

                    The Bank also has the  authority  to borrow from the Federal
Reserve  "discount  window," if it has exhausted  all FHL Bank sources.  Federal
Reserve Banks are prohibited from


                                       34

<PAGE>

providing a discount  window advance to an  "undercapitalized"  institution  for
more than 60 days in a 120-day period, except in limited circumstances.

Federal Home Loan Bank System

                The Federal  Home Loan Bank System  consists of 12 regional  FHL
Banks, each subject to supervision and regulation by the Federal Housing Finance
Board (the "FHFB").  The FHL Banks provide a central credit  facility for member
savings  institutions.  The  Bank,  as a member  of the FHL Bank of  Boston,  is
required  to own shares of capital  stock in that FHL Bank in an amount at least
equal to one percent of the aggregate principal amount of its unpaid residential
mortgage loans, home purchase contracts and similar obligations at the beginning
of each year, or 1/20 of its advances  (borrowings) from the FHL Bank, whichever
is greater. The Bank was in compliance with this requirement. The maximum amount
that  the FHL  Bank of  Boston  will  advance  fluctuates  from  time to time in
accordance with changes in policies of the FHFB and the FHL Bank of Boston,  and
the maximum amount generally is reduced by borrowings from any other source.  In
addition,  the amount of FHL Bank advances that a savings institution may obtain
will be restricted in the event the  institution  fails to constitute a QTL. See
"Federal Savings Bank Regulation -- Qualified Thrift Lender Requirement."

                The FHFB has promulgated regulations that establish standards of
community  service  or  support  as a basis  for FHL Bank  members  to  maintain
continued access to long-term  advances.  Pursuant to the regulations,  each FHL
Bank member is required to provide a Community  Support Statement ("CSS") to its
FHLB for review on a  schedule  established  by the FHFB.  The CCS is to include
information  regarding  the  members  Community   Reinvestment  Act  evaluation,
evidence of assistance to first-time home buyers, documentation of any judgments
based on violation of the Fair Housing and Equal Credit  Opportunity  Acts,  and
evidence of community  support.  The FHFB reviews  certain of the statements and
will require a Community  Support  Action Plan ("CSAP") if it disapproves of the
CSS.  If the  member  has  failed  to  submit a CSS,  submits a CSAP that is not
approved,  or fails to substantially meet its CSAP within one year, the FHFB may
restrict the members access to long-term advances.

Taxation

                Federal.  Webster,  on behalf of  itself  and its  subsidiaries,
files a calendar tax year  consolidated  federal income tax return.  Webster and
its  subsidiaries  report their income and expenses  using the accrual method of
accounting.

                Savings  institutions  are generally taxed in the same manner as
other  corporations.  Unlike other  corporations,  however,  qualifying  savings
institutions  that meet  certain  definitional  tests  relating to the nature of
their  supervision,  income,  assets  and  business  operations  are  allowed to
establish a reserve for bad debts and for each tax year are  permitted to deduct
additions to that reserve for losses on "qualifying  real property  loans" using
the more favorable of the following two alternative  methods: (1) a method based
on the institution's  actual loss experience (the "experience method") or (ii) a
method based on a specified  percentage of an institution's  taxable income (the
"percentage of taxable income method"). "Qualifying real property loans" are, in
general,  loans secured by interests in improved real property.  The addition to
the reserve for losses on  nonqualifying  real  property  loans must be computed
under the experience method.

                Under  the  percentage  of  taxable  income  method,  qualifying
institutions  may  deduct  up  to 8%  of  their  taxable  income  after  certain
adjustments and subject to the limitations  discussed  below.  The net effect of
the percentage of taxable income method deduction is that the maximum  effective
federal  income tax rate on income  computed  without regard to actual bad debts
and certain other factors for qualifying institutions is 32.20%

                                       35


<PAGE>


                The amount of the bad debt deduction  that savings  institutions
such as the Bank may claim with  respect to  additions  to its  reserve  for bad
debts is subject to certain limitations. First, the percentage of taxable income
or  experience  method  deduction  will be  eliminated  entirely,  the  existing
reserves  will be recaptured  into taxable  income and the  institution  will be
permitted a deduction only for specific charge-offs,  unless at least 60% of the
savings institution's assets fall within certain designated categories.  Second,
the bad debt deduction  attributable to "qualifying  real property loans" cannot
exceed the greater of (1) the amount  deductible under the experience  method or
(ii) the amount which,  when added to the bad debt  deduction for  nonqualifying
loans,  equals  the  amount  by which 12% of the sum of the  total  deposits  or
withdrawable  accounts  at the end of the  taxable  year  exceeds the sum of the
surplus,  undivided  profits and reserves at the  beginning of the taxable year.
Third,  the amount of the bad debt  deduction  attributable  to qualifying  real
property  loans  computed  using the  percentage  of  taxable  income  method is
permitted  only to the  extent  that the  institution's  reserve  for  losses on
qualifying  real property  loans at the close of the taxable  year,  taking into
account the addition to that reserve for that taxable  year,  does not exceed 6%
of such  loans  outstanding  at such  time.  Fourth,  the  deduction  under  the
percentage  of taxable  income  method is reduced,  but not below  zero,  by the
amount of the  addition to reserves  for losses on  nonqualifying  loans for the
taxable  year.  Finally,  a savings  institution  that computes its tax bad debt
deduction  using the  percentage of taxable  income method and files its federal
income  tax  return  as part of a  consolidated  group  is  required  to  reduce
proportionately  its taxable  income for losses  attributable  to  activities of
nonsavings  institution members of the consolidated group that are "functionally
related" to the savings  institution  member. The savings  institution member is
permitted, however, to proportionately increase its taxable income in subsequent
years to recover any such  reduction  to the extent the  nonsavings  institution
members  realize income in subsequent  years from their  "functionally  related"
activities. Webster does not expect that these various restrictions will operate
to limit significantly the amount of its otherwise allowable bad debt deductions
in the near future.

                At  December  31,  1995,  the Bank had tax bad debt  reserves of
approximately  $16.4 million.  To the extent that (1) the reserves for losses on
qualifying real property loans  established by the Bank, using the percentage of
taxable income method,  exceed the amount that would have been allowed under the
experience method and (ii) the Bank makes  distributions to its shareholder that
are considered to result in withdrawals from that institution's  excess bad debt
reserve,  then the amounts  considered to be withdrawn  will be included in that
institution's  taxable  income.  The  amount  considered  to be  withdrawn  by a
distribution will be the amount of the distribution plus the amount necessary to
pay the federal income tax with respect to the withdrawal. Dividends paid out of
the Bank's current or accumulated earnings and profits as calculated for federal
income tax purposes,  however,  will not be considered to result in  withdrawals
from the Bank's bad debt reserves. Distributions in excess of the Bank's current
and accumulated earnings and profits,  distributions in redemption of stock, and
distributions in partial or complete liquidation of the foregoing  institutions,
will be considered to result in withdrawals from the Banks bad debt reserves.

                Depending on the composition of its items of income and expense,
a savings  institution  may be subject to the  alternative  minimum tax. For tax
years  beginning  after  1986,  a savings  institution  must pay an  alternative
minimum  tax equal to the  amount (if any) by which 20% of  alternative  minimum
taxable income ("AMTI"),  as reduced by an exemption varying with AMTI,  exceeds
the regular tax due. AMTI equals regular  taxable income  increased or decreased
by certain  adjustments  and  increased  by certain tax  preferences,  including
depreciation deductions in excess of those allowable for alternative minimum tax
purposes, tax-exempt interest on most private activity bonds issued after August
7, 1986  (reduced by any related  interest  expense  disallowed  for regular tax
purposes), the amount of the bad debt reserve deduction claimed in excess of the
deduction  based on the experience  method and, for tax years after 1989, 75% of
the excess of adjusted  current  earnings over AMTI. AMTI may be reduced only up
to 90% by net operating loss carryovers,  but the payment of altemative  minimum
tax will give rise to a minimum  tax  credit  which  will be  available  with an
indefinite   carryforward   period,  to  reduce  federal  income  taxes  of  the
institution in future years (but

                                       36


<PAGE>

not  below  the  level  of  alternative  minimum  tax  arising  in  each  of the
carryforward years). See also 'Bank Regulation -- Insurance of Deposits."

                  Webster's federal income tax returns have been examined by the
Internal  Revenue  Service for tax years  through 1990 and are  currently  under
examination by the Internal Revenue Service for tax years 1991 through 1993.

                  State.  State  income  taxation  is  in  accordance  with  the
corporate  income tax laws of  Connecticut  and other  states on an  apportioned
basis.  For the State of Connecticut the Bank and its  subsidiaries are required
to pay taxes  Linder the larger of two  methods but no less than the minimum tax
of $250 per entity. Method one is 11.25% (scheduled to decrease to 7.5% by 2000)
of the year's  taxable  income  (which,  with  certain  exceptions,  is equal to
taxable income for federal purposes) or method two,  (additional tax on capital)
an amount  equal to 3 and 1/10 mills per  dollar on its  average  capital  and a
special rule for banks to calculate its  additional  tax base is an amount equal
to 4% of the amount of  interest  or  dividends  credited by the Bank on savings
accounts of depositors  or account  holders  during the preceding  taxable year,
provided that, in determining such amount, interest or dividends credited to the
savings  account of a depositor or account holder are deemed to be the lesser of
the actual interest or dividends credited or the interest or dividend that would
have  been  credited  if it had  been  computed  and  credited  at the  rate  of
one-eighth  of 1 % per annum.  In addition,  a surtax was imposed in prior years
equal  to 20%  (reduced  to 10% in  1992  and  eliminated  in  1993)  of the tax
calculated as set forth in the preceding  sentence  (excluding  the $250 minimum
tax)  without  reduction  of the tax so  calculated  by the amount of any credit
against the tax.


Item 2. Properties At December 31, 1995 (after giving effect to the consummation
from the Shawmut  Transaction  on  February  16,  1996),  Webster had 29 banking
offices in New Haven County, 29 banking offices in Hartford County,  two banking
offices in Fairfield  County,  two banking offices in Litchfield  County and two
banking offices in Middlesex  County.  Twenty of the banking offices are related
to the Shawmut  Transaction  and so are noted in the  following  banking  office
table.

                           SEVERANCE PAYMENT AGREEMENT
                           ---------------------------

                  AGREEMENT, dated as of April 17, 1995, among WEBSTER FINANCIAL
CORPORATION (the "Company"),  FIRST FEDERAL BANK, FSB (the "Bank"), and PETER K.
MULLIGAN (the "Employee").

                  WHEREAS,  the  Employee  is  serving  as  the  Executive  Vice
President, Consumer Banking of the Company, the Bank and Bristol Savings Bank, a
wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company ("Bristol");

                  WHEREAS,  the Boards of  Directors of the Company and the Bank
believe  that  it is in the  best  interests  of the  Company  and  the  Bank to
encourage  the  Employee's  continued  employment  with  and  dedication  to the
Company,   the  Bank  and  Bristol  in  the  face  of  potentially   distracting
circumstances arising from the possibility of a change in control of the Company
or the Bank, although no such change is now contemplated;

                  WHEREAS,  the Boards of  Directors of the Company and the Bank
have approved  and-authorized  the entry into this  Agreement with the Employee;
and

                  WHEREAS,  the  parties  desire to enter  into  this  Agreement
setting forth the terms and conditions  for the payment of special  compensation
to the  Employee in the event of a termination of the  Employee's  employment in
connection  with or as the result of a change in  control of the  Company or the
Bank;

                  NOW, THEREFORE, it is AGREED as follows:

                  1. Term.  The initial  term of this  Agreement  shall be for a
period  commencing  on the date  hereof and ending on  December  31,  1997.  The
Company and the Bank may renew this  Agreement by written notice to the Employee
for one  additional  year on December 31, 1995 and each  subsequent  December 31
during  the  term of  this  Agreement.  References  herein  to the  term of this
Agreement shall include the initial term and any additional years for which this
Agreement is renewed.

                  2.  Termination  of Employment in Connection  with a Change in
                  --------------------------------------------------------------
Control.
- --------

                           (a) If during the term of this  Agreement  there is a
change in control of the Company or the Bank,  the Employee shall be entitled to
receive  from the Company and the Bank,  jointly and  severally,  as a severance
payment for services previously rendered to the Company and the Bank, a lump sum
cash payment as provided for herein (subject to Section 2(c) below) in the event
the


<PAGE>

Employee's employment is terminated, voluntarily or involuntarily, in connection
with or within two years after the change in control of the Company or the Bank,
unless  such  termination  is for  cause  (as  defined  below),  is a  voluntary
termination without "Good Reason" (as defined below) in connection with or after
a  "Technical  Change"  (as  defined  below),  or  occurs  by  virtue  of normal
retirement,  permanent and total disability (as defined for purposes of any long
term disability plan maintained by the Company or the Bank in which the Employee
is a  participant,  or, if there is no such plan, as defined in Section 22(e) of
the Internal  Revenue Code) or death.  Subject to Section 2(c) below, the amount
of the payment  shall be equal to one year's  salary from the Company,  the Bank
and  Bristol  plus any  bonuses  paid by them to the  Employee  during  the then
current  fiscal  year,  if (i) the  Employee's  termination  of  employment  was
voluntary  without  "Good  Reason"  (as  hereinafter   defined)  other  than  in
connection with or following a "Technical  Change" (as defined  below),  or (ii)
the Employee's  termination of employment was either  voluntary with Good Reason
or involuntary.  For purposes of this Agreement, a "Technical Change" shall mean
a change in control  described in Section 2( b)(vii) below (and not described in
any other subsection of Section 2(b)) in which the persons who were directors of
the Company before the transaction described in such subsection shall constitute
at  least  50%  of the  Board  of  Directors  of the  Company  or any  successor
corporation.  The term "termination for cause" shall mean termination because of
the Employee's personal dishonesty,  incompetence, - willful misconduct,  breach
of fiduciary  duty involving  personal  profit,  intentional  failure to perform
stated duties,  willful  violation of any law,  rule, or regulation  (other than
traffic  violations or similar offenses) or final cease-and- desist order. "Good
Reason" shall include a material reduction in the position, authority, duties or
responsibilities of the Employee from those which existed prior to the change in
control  or a  reduction  in the  Employee's  job  stature as  reflected  in the
Employee's  title.  If the  Employee  notifies  the Boards of  Directors  of the
Company  and  the  Bank  that  the  Employee  intends  to  terminate  employment
voluntarily for Good Reason, the Employee shall state in such notice the reasons
why the Employee  believes that Good Reason  exists.  Unless the Company and the
Bank,  within 30 days of the date of the  Employee's  notice of  resignation  or
termination,  reject the  Employee's  statement  that Good  Reason  exists,  the
Employee's  entitlement to the severance payment payable under clause (ii) above
shall be conclusive.  If the Boards of Directors reject the Employee's statement
of Good  Reason  within  such 30-day  period,  the  dispute  shall be settled by
arbitration in accordance with the Commercial  Arbitration Rules of the American
Arbitration Association,  and judgment upon the award rendered by the arbitrator
may be entered in any court having jurisdiction thereof, but the Company and the
Bank shall have the burden of proving in such  arbitration  that their rejection
of the Employee's statement was proper. Payment under this Section 2(a) shall be
in lieu of any amount which may be otherwise owed to the Employee as damages for
such  termination.  Payment  under this Section 2(a) shall not be reduced by any
compensation  which the Employee may receive from other  employment with another
employer after termination of the Employee's employment with




                                      - 2 -

the Company  and the Bank.  No payment  hereunder  shall  affect the  Employee's
entitlement to any vested retirement benefits or other compensation payments.

                  In addition, subject to Section 2(c) below, in the case of any
termination  of  employment  within the scope of this  Section  2(a) for which a
severance payment is payable to the Employee, the following shall apply: (1) the
Employee shall also be entitled to continued  medical,  dental,  group term life
insurance  and  long-term   disability   insurance  coverage  and  to  continued
eligibility  for benefits under any other employee  welfare benefit plan (within
the meaning of Section 3(l) of the Employee  Retirement  Income  Security Act of
1974, as amended) in which the Employee was eligible to  participate  before the
change in control,  on a basis no less  favorable to the  Employee  than that in
effect  during the fiscal year  preceding the fiscal year in which the change in
control occurs, as if the Employee's  employment had not been terminated,  which
coverage and eligibility shall continue for one year after the termination;  and
(2)  all  insurance  or  other  provisions  for   indemnification,   defense  or
hold-harmless  of officers and  directors of the-  Company,  the Bank or Bristol
that are in effect on the date the notice of  termination  is given by or to the
Employee  shall  continue for the benefit of the Employee with respect to all of
the  Employee's  acts and  omissions  while an officer or  director as fully and
completely  as if such  termination  had  not  occurred,  and  until  the  final
expiration or running of all periods of limitation  against  action which may be
applicable to such acts. or omissions.

                           (b) A "change in control" of the Company, for purpose
s of this  Agreement,  shall be deemed to have  taken  place if:  (i) any person
becomes the beneficial owner of 25 percent or more of the total number of voting
shares of the  Company;  (ii) any  person  becomes  the  beneficial  owner of 10
percent or more, but less than 25 percent,  of the total number of voting shares
of the Company,  unless.  the Director of the Office of Thrift  Supervision (the
"Director")  has  approved a  rebuttal  agreement  filed by such  person or such
person has filed a  certification  with , the Director;  (iii) any person (other
than the persons named as proxies  solicited on behalf of the Board of Directors
of the Company) holds  revocable or irrevocable  proxies,  as to the election or
removal of two or more  directors of the Company,  for 25 percent or more of the
total number of voting  shares of the Company;  (iv) any person has received the
approval  of the  Director  under  Section 10 of the Home  Owners'  Loan Act, as
amended (the "Holding  Company  Act"),  or  regulations  issued  thereunder,  to
acquire  control of the  Company;  (v) any person has  received  approval of the
Director  under Section 7(j) of the Federal  Deposit  Insurance  Act, as amended
(the "Control Act"), or regulations issued thereunder, to acquire control of the
Company;  (vi) any person has commenced a tender or exchange  offer,  or entered
into an agreement or received an option, to acquire  beneficial  ownership of 25
percent or more of the total number of voting shares of the Company,  whether or
not the requisite  approval for such  acquisition  has been  received  under the
Holding  Company  Act,  the Control Act, or the  respective  regulations  issued
thereunder, or (vii) as the result of, or in connection with, any cash tender or
exchange offer,

merger, or other business combination,  sale of assets or contested election, or
any combination of the foregoing transactions, the persons who were directors of
the  Company  before  such  transaction  shall  cease  to  constitute  at  least
two-thirds   of  the  Board  of  Directors  of  the  Company  or  any  successor
corporation.  Notwithstanding  the foregoing,  a "change in control" will not be
deemed to have occurred  under clauses (ii),  (iii),  (iv),  (v) or (vi) of this
section  2(b),  if within 30 days of such action,  the Board of Directors of the
Company (by a two-thirds affirmative vote of the directors in office before such
action  occurred)  makes a  determination  that such  action does not and is not
likely to constitute a "change in control" of the Company.  For purposes of this
Section  2(b),  a "person"  includes an  individual,  corporation,  partnership,
trust, association, joint venture, pool, syndicate, unincorporated organization,
joint-stock company or similar organization or group acting in concert. A person
for these purposes shall be deemed to be a beneficial owner as that term is used
in Rule 13d-3 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934.

                  A "change  in  control"  of the  Bank,  for  purposes  of this
Agreement,  shall be  deemed to have  taken  place if the  Company's  beneficial
ownership  of the total  number of voting  shares of the Bank is reduced to less
than 50 percent.

                           (c)  Notwithstanding  any  other  provisions  of this
Agreement or of any other agreement,  contract,  or understanding  heretofore or
hereafter  entered into between the Employee and the Company or the Bank (or any
subsidiary or affiliate of either of them),  except an agreement,  contract,  or
understanding  hereafter  entered  into  that  expressly  modifies  or  excludes
application of this Section 2(c) (the "Other  Agreements"),  and notwithstanding
any formal or informal plan or other arrangement heretofore or hereafter adopted
by the Company or the Bank (or any  subsidiary  or  affiliate of either of them)
for the direct or indirect provision of compensation to the Employee  (including
groups or classes of  participants or  beneficiaries  of which the Employee is a
member),  whether or not such compensation is deferred, is in cash, or is in the
form of a benefit to or for the Employee (a "Benefit Plan"),  the Employee shall
not have any right to receive any payment or other benefit under this Agreement,
any Other Agreement, or any Benefit Plan if such payment or benefit, taking into
account  all other  payments  or  benefits  to or for the  Employee  under  this
Agreement, all Other Agreements,  and all Benefit Plans, would cause any payment
to the  Employee  under this  Agreement to be  considered  a parachute  payment"
within the meaning of Section 28OG(b)(2) of the Code (a "Parachute Payment"). In
the event that the receipt of any such payment or benefit under this  Agreement,
any  Other  Agreement,  or any  Benefit  Plan  would  cause the  Employee  to be
considered to have received a Parachute  Payment under this Agreement,  then the
Employee shall have the right, in the Employee's sole  discretion,  to designate
those payments or benefits under this Agreement,  any Other  Agreements,  and/or
any Benefit  Plans,  which should be reduced or eliminated so as to avoid having
the payment to the  Employee  under this  Agreement  be deemed to be a Parachute
Payment.

parties  hereto.  No party may  assign or  delegate  any  rights or  obligations
hereunder  without  first  obtaining  the written  consent of the other  parties
hereto.  However,  in the  event of the  death of the  Employee,  all  rights to
receive payments hereunder shall become rights of the Employee's estate.

                  4. Amendments or Additions;  Action by Board of Directors.  No
amendments or additions to this Agreement shall be binding unless in writing and
signed by all parties  hereto.  The prior  approval by a two-thirds  affirmative
vote of the full  Boards  of  Directors  of the  Company  and the Bank  shall be
required in order for the Company and the Bank to authorize  any  amendments  or
additions to this Agreement.

Agreement are included solely for  convenience and shall not affect,  or be used

To Our Shareholders

"Webster  strives to help  individuals,  families  and  businesses  reach  their
financial goals.  Our focus is on building  valuable  customer  relationships by
providing a broad range of products and services and superior customer service."

We are pleased to report that 1995 was a year of significant  accomplishment for
Webster Financial Corporation. In furthering its record of sound, steady growth,
Webster  expanded  its  franchise  and  its  product  offerings.  Guided  by our
conservative  business  philosophy,  we continued our emphasis on asset quality,
recurring earnings and expense control.

Accomplishments   for  the  year  included  record  operating   earnings  before
non-recurring  items and an increase in the cash dividend.  In October,  Webster
accelerated  its transition from a traditional  thrift to a full-service  retail
bank by agreeing to acquire 20 branches  of Shawmut  Bank  Connecticut.  Webster
subsequently  raised  $34  million in a common  stock  offering  to support  the
Shawmut  branch  acquisition.  The Shawmut branch  acquisition  was completed on
February 16, 1996.  In November,  Webster  acquired  Shelton  Bancorp and merged
Webster's  three bank  subsidiaries  into a single entity renamed  Webster Bank.
Once again,  Webster received the highest rating for Community  Reinvestment Act
(CRA) compliance.

Webster  strives  to help  individuals,  families  and  businesses  reach  their
financial goals.  Our focus is on building  valuable  customer  relationships by
providing a broad range of products and services and superior  customer service.
The bank is  organized  along three  business  lines --  consumer,  business and
mortgage  banking -- each focused on meeting the special needs of its customers.
Webster's  growing  franchise and automated  and telephone  banking  initiatives
enhance   customer  access  and  convenience.   Webster   customers  now  access
information and transact their banking  business from automated  teller machines
(ATMs) worldwide and through Webster's 24-hour banking center.

Webster has completed  and  integrated  six  acquisitions  since 1991,  each one
contributing  to  Webster's  improving  results.  Today,  Webster  is the second
largest  Connecticut-based  bank with assets of $4 billion and over $210 million
in  shareholders'  equity.  Our 1,200 employees serve 275,000  customers from 64
banking  offices and 84 ATMs in  Connecticut,  extending from the  Massachusetts
border to Long Island Sound.

1995 Earnings

Earnings  for the year were  $18.3  million  or $2.30 per  fully  diluted  share
compared to $18.7  million or $2.44 per fully  diluted  share in 1994.  The 1995
results were reduced by $2.7 million of  non-recurring  items net after tax. The
1995  earnings  would have been $18.9  million or $2.83 per fully  diluted share
were it not for the effects of the Shelton acquisition and the net non-recurring
items. Book value per share increased 16 percent in 1995, to $23.87.

Net non-recurring  pretax expenses of $6.4 million were partially offset by $2.2
million  in  pretax  gains  on  the  sale  of  mortgage  loan   servicing.   The
non-recurring  expenses include a $3.3 million charge related to the acquisition
of Shelton  Bancorp,  Inc.,  $2.1  million of expenses  related to the merger of
Webster's three banking  subsidiaries  and name change and $1.0 million of costs
incurred in  preparation  for Webster's  acquisition of 20 former Shawmut branch
banking offices.

Dividend
Webster has paid a regular  quarterly cash dividend for 34 consecutive  quarters
since the  corporation  paid its first  dividend in 1987. In January  1995,  the
board of directors increased the dividend 23 percent to $.16 per common share.

Shawmut Branch Acquisition
In October,  Webster signed a definitive agreement with Shawmut Bank Connecticut
to purchase 20 Shawmut Bank offices in the Hartford  banking  market,  including
approximately   $845  million  in  deposits  and  $586  million  in  loans.  The
acquisition,   which  was  consummated  on  February  16,  1996,   expanded  and
strengthened    Webster's    franchise   and   created   the   second    largest
Connecticut-based  bank in the state with a six percent statewide deposit market
share.

This  acquisition  accelerated  Webster's  transition from a traditional  thrift
institution to a full-service  retail bank.  The Shawmut  acquisition  increases
Webster's  deposit market share in the Hartford  banking market from 3.2 percent
to 8.3 percent, giving Webster the second largest share in that market.

Shelton Bancorp Acquisition

Webster completed the purchase of Shelton Bancorp on November 1. Shelton Bancorp
contributed assets of $295 million and six full-service banking offices in south
central  Connecticut.  The  acquisition  extended  Webster's  franchise  into an
attractive  contiguous  market and added 13,000  households to Webster's growing
customer base.

Subsidiaries Merged and Renamed Webster Bank

In November,  Webster merged its subsidiary banks -- First Federal Bank, Bristol
Savings Bank and Shelton  Savings Bank -- into a single entity  renamed  Webster
Bank. The merger and renaming benefitted both Webster and its customers.

The merger  enables our customers to transact  their banking  business at any of
Webster's  offices  throughout  Connecticut.  The larger bank now offers a wider
array of products and services.  Additionally,  Webster's  commercial  customers
benefit from the bank's presence in a larger geographic area and from the bank's
ability to accommodate the credit needs of larger customers.

The merger enabled Webster to achieve economies of scale,  eliminate duplicative
administrative  activities,  streamline  operations  and reduce  costs.  Webster
Financial  Corporation and Webster Bank are now regulated by a single regulator,
further reducing expenses and the cost of compliance.

Webster Bank expects to achieve  greater name  recognition in the marketplace at
reduced cost by  advertising  as a single bank.  The name change also aligns the
name of the bank more closely with the name of the holding company.

Raising Capital to Support the Shawmut Acquisition

In  December,  Webster  raised $34 million in an offering  of  1,249,600  common
shares  priced at $27.25 per share.  Net proceeds of this public  offering  were
used to support the acquisition of the Shawmut  branches.  Webster currently has
$210  million in equity  capital and  approximately  8.1 million  common  shares
outstanding.

Community Reinvestment Act

Webster is committed to making a meaningful  investment  in the  communities  it
serves  and  is  dedicated  to  achieving   the   objectives  of  the  Community
Reinvestment  Act  (CRA)  and  Fair  Lending   Practices.   Webster  provides  a
comprehensive  array of deposit  and loan  products  to support the needs of all
community members including minorities and low-income  families.  Our commitment
to our  communities  has earned  Webster  the highest  attainable  CRA rating --
Outstanding -- for the third consecutive  rating period, and has helped us build
valuable customer relationships.

Rights Agreement

In February 1996,  Webster's  board of directors  adopted a Rights  Agreement to
assist  the  board  in   protecting   the  rights  and   investment  of  Webster
shareholders.  The plan is designed to protect all Webster  shareholders against
hostile acquirers who may seek to take advantage of Webster and its shareholders
through  coercive or unfair tactics aimed at gaining  control of Webster without
paying all shareholders a full and fair price.

Outlook

The economic outlook for Connecticut appears to be improving.  While lagging the
national  economy,  the  Connecticut  economy  continues to show modest signs of
improvement.   While  corporate   restructuring  and  downsizing  may  continue,
encouraging growth is evident in small businesses statewide.

Growth

Webster  remains  committed to the goal of sound,  steady growth.  Our expanding
franchise,  broader  product  offerings  and  steadfast  attention  to  superior
customer  service  create  opportunities  in this  regard.  We  intend to pursue
opportunities to further  strengthen  Webster's  franchise through  combinations
with other financial institutions on terms that are consistent with this goal.

The year  1995 was a  rewarding  one for  Webster.  Our  achievements  were made
possible through the extraordinary dedication of our employees and the continued
support of our  customers and  shareholders.  Our future is bright as we realize
the benefits of recent  acquisitions  and continue our  transition  to a leading
Connecticut retail bank. We appreciate your investment.

Sincerely,


James C. Smith
Chairman and Chief Executive Officer

Webster Bank Offices

Webster's  franchise  extends  from the  Massachusetts  border  through  central
Connecticut to Long Island Sound.  The Shawmut branch  acquisition  expanded our
network in the Greater Hartford area. The Shelton acquisition extended Webster's
franchise in south central Connecticut.  Today,  Webster's franchise includes 64
full-service  offices  and 84 ATMs  located  in the  central  and most  populous
corridor of Connecticut.

Consumer Banking

Webster  expects  that by 1998,  our  customers  will conduct over 60 percent of
their  transactions using automated or telephone banking means. Here, a customer
uses a 24-hour ATM to make a deposit at Webster's new downtown Hartford office.

It wasn't long ago that superior  customer  service  meant a fast-moving  teller
line and courteous,  professional,  bankers. But as consumer preferences change,
the  definition  has been  expanded to include new product  offerings and easier
methods  by  which  to  access  those  products.   Today,   consumers  look  for
full-service  retail banks offering  everything from basic checking  accounts to
mutual funds and annuities to telephone banking.  Webster  continuously  expands
its product and service offerings to meet evolving consumer needs.

For customers who continue to favor branch banking, Webster offers 64 convenient
locations  from the  Massachusetts  border through  central  Connecticut to Long
Island  Sound.  But  recognizing  that a  growing  number  of  customers  prefer
automated  access to  banking  services,  Webster  has  steadily  increased  its
investment  in  technology  to develop  products and  services  that enhance our
customers'   ability  to  access   their   accounts   and  Webster   telebanking
representatives at anytime and from anywhere they choose.

Webster Bank's First CallSM telephone  banking service  (800-325-2424)  provides
access to  account  information  24 hours a day,  seven  days a week.  More than
45,000  customers  use First Call weekly to get  up-to-date  balances on Webster
accounts,  transfer funds,  and make payments on Webster  installment  loans and
mortgages.   Using  First   Call,   customers   may  also  speak  with   Webster
representatives after normal banking hours to open accounts,  apply for loans or
to simply ask questions. We expect that by 1998, Webster customers will transact
over 60 percent of their banking business by direct banking means.

In 1995,  Webster made  significant  additions to its consumer  product line. We
introduced  the  Webster  Check  Card,  a debit card that can be used at over 12
million  merchant  locations  worldwide.  We  also  introduced  WebsterOneSM,  a
relationship  banking  package that affords  customers the opportunity to reduce
fees,  earn more on savings and  simplify  their  bookkeeping  with one combined
statement.  Additionally, Webster introduced a valuable home equity product that
provides  loans of up to 100  percent  of the  available  equity in a  principal
residence. Webster will introduce its own credit card later this year.

Webster  offers  advanced  products to meet our customers  changing  needs while
maintaining a hometown bank atmosphere.  Providing  superior customer service is
the primary focus of Webster Bank.

Webster's  new  Check  Card  combines  the  convenience  of an ATM card with the
purchasing  power of a Visa  card.  Accepted  at over 12 million  Visa  merchant
locations  worldwide,  the Check Card  automatically  deducts  purchases  from a
customer's  checking  account - it works just like a check.  Here, a customer of
Lane and Lenge in West  Hartford  Center uses her  Webster  Check Card to make a
floral purchase.

Business Banking

Webster  recently  introduced its Webster  FAX-LinkTM  service which provides an
automatic  morning fax to businesses  detailing  checking  account  balances and
transaction  information.  The  Business  Banking  Unit has over $500 million in
credit balances and $150 million in business deposits.

Businesses  large and small fuel our economy,  creating jobs and opportunity for
people from Hartford to Hamden,  from Windsor to Waterbury.  Webster facilitates
this  process  by  providing  credit  and  other  banking  services   throughout
Connecticut, where Webster is among the largest business banks.

Webster provides a full range of business  banking  products and services,  from
cash management to the most complex financing packages.  In 1995, Webster opened
a  business  banking  office in  Hartford  and  expanded  its  business  banking
operations in the Bristol,  New Haven, and Waterbury  regions.  We also formed a
Small  Business  Banking Unit to focus on the special needs of  businesses  with
credit  requirements of up to $250,000.  Every business customer has a dedicated
relationship  manager  who serves as the primary  contact  and liaison  with all
Webster service areas.

Business  Banking  has  introduced  several  new  products to make it easier for
customers  to access  account  information  at anytime  and from  anywhere  they
choose.  Our Webster  PC-LinkTM  product is a PC-based  service  designed to let
businesses  retrieve  and analyze  information  about  Webster  accounts  and to
perform  transactions.  Our Webster FAX- LinkTM product is an automatic  morning
fax service to business customers providing balance and transaction information.
Additionally,  Webster  offers a telephone  banking  service that lets  business
banking  customers  transfer funds between  accounts and perform other financial
transactions  over the phone.  For the many  Connecticut  companies  involved in
foreign trade,  Webster offers international  services including import,  export
and standby letters of credit, acceptance financing and foreign exchange.

Webster's  commitment  to promoting  economic  expansion in  Connecticut  and to
helping  firms  grow  and  create  jobs  makes  us a strong  partner  for  state
businesses. And as businesses prosper, so too will Webster.

Businesses  fuel job  growth  which,  in turn,  fuels the  economy.  Webster  is
committed to providing the capital small- and  medium-sized  businesses  need to
prosper and expand in  Connecticut.  Here,  Bob Annon,  senior  vice  president,
Webster Business Banking,  and Edgar B. Butler, Jr., president and chief quality
officer of The Taylor & Fenn Company in Windsor, view a 3,500 pound casting made
for a Taylor & Fenn  customer.  Taylor & Fenn,  a Webster  customer  since 1986,
employs 136 people and was  recently  named the top state  designee for the Blue
Chip Enterprise  Initiative  sponsored by The United States Chamber of Commerce,
Nations Business magazine and the Connecticut Mutual Life Insurance Company.

Mortgage Banking

Fitz and Cheryl  Morrison  of New Haven  enjoy  their new  two-family  home made
possible in part by a mortgage from Webster Bank. A leading  mortgage  lender in
Connecticut,  Webster is committed to helping  people buy,  build and  refinance
their homes.

Webster's roots lie in mortgage  lending.  Sixty years ago,  Webster's  founder,
Harold Webster Smith,  assisted would-be  homeowners in buying or building their
homes by providing  mortgage  financing  during the Depression era of the 1930s.
Today,  Webster is a leading  mortgage lender in Connecticut  still committed to
helping people buy, build and refinance their homes.

Webster  closed  $275  million  in  residential  first  mortgage  loans in 1995,
including $107 million to first-time homebuyers, and $60 million in construction
financing. Webster participates with federal, state and local agencies to assist
Connecticut  families buy homes. These agencies include the Connecticut  Housing
Finance Authority, the Connecticut Department of Housing, Fannie Mae and Freddie
Mac, to name but a few. Webster actively promotes programs which are designed to
meet the special needs of low-to-moderate income families.

Superior  customer  service  and  innovative  products  are what make  Webster a
successful mortgage lender.  From first-time  homebuyer loans to jumbo mortgages
to construction loans,  Webster meets each customer's unique needs. For example,
Webster's  Family  MortgageSM  introduced  in 1995 allows  parents to help their
children buy homes.  Parents can pledge certificates of deposit or the equity in
their own homes as collateral in lieu of a downpayment. Another popular product,
Webster's  flexible  construction  loan  automatically  converts  to a permanent
mortgage loan.

Innovative  products  mean little if they are  difficult  to access.  That's why
mortgage originators,  equipped with laptop computers,  visit customers in their
homes or their offices to complete an application in just minutes. Responding to
the need for more  convenient  access to bank services,  our laptop  origination
process is a major competitive advantage for Webster.

Mortgage  products  and the way they are  delivered  have  changed a great  deal
through the years. But our commitment to making the dream of homeownership  come
true for Connecticut residents is as strong today as it was in 1935.

Webster  mortgage  originators  count  themselves  among the select few  bankers
nationwide  equipped with laptop computers to expedite the application  process.
Using  laptop  computers,  our  originators  reduce  the time it takes to file a
mortgage application,  and, reduce by a minimum of three days, the time it takes
for an  application to receive  approval.  Here,  Barry and Debbie  Pasqurell of
Berlin provide financial  information for their refinance application to Webster
loan originator Renee Gonzalez.

Harold Webster Smith

On October 11,  1935,  during the depths of the  Depression,  24-year old Harold
Webster Smith opened a bank in downtown  Waterbury,  Connecticut with $25,000 in
deposits  gathered from family and friends.  First Federal  Savings of Waterbury
was founded to help  community  members buy and build their  homes.  Guided by a
conservative  business  philosophy  and  an  extraordinary   commitment  to  its
customers,  the bank has  grown in its  founder's  image to  become  the  second
largest Connecticut-based bank.

As you have read in this  report,  on November 1, 1995,  60 years after the bank
was founded,  Webster  Financial  Corporation  merged First  Federal and its two
other  subsidiary banks into a single entity with a new name - Webster Bank. The
merger  achieved  economies  of scale and  enables  Webster to |resent a unified
image in all  markets.  The name  Webster  was chosen to honor Mr.  Smith and to
reaffirm the bank's Connecticut roots.

Webster's  headquarters  building,  depicted on the cover of this report, is but
four blocks from Mr. Smith's  birthplace and two blocks from the bank's original
main  office.  Mr.  Smith  retired  as chief  executive  officer  in 1987 and as
chairman of the board in 1995. He continues to serve Webster today as a director
and as chairman emeritus.

Management's  Discussion  and  Analysis of  Financial  Condition  and Results of
Operations

Introduction

Webster Financial  Corporation,  ("Webster" or the  "Corporation"),  through its
subsidiary,  Webster Bank,  (the "Bank")  delivers  financial  services to local
individuals  and  businesses.  Webster's  Mission is to build  valuable  banking
relationships  by helping  individuals,  families and  businesses to reach their
financial  goals.  The company has grown  profitably in recent years,  primarily
through a series of  acquisitions  which  have  expanded  and  strengthened  its
franchise and have accelerated  Webster's  transition from a traditional  thrift
institution  to a  full-service  retail bank.  Webster is organized  along three
lines of  business--consumer,  business and mortgage banking each focused on the
special  needs  of  its  customers.  Webster's  1,200  employees  serve  275,000
customers  from  64  banking   offices  in   Connecticut,   extending  from  the
Massachusetts border to Long Island Sound.

Webster's  goals are to  ensure  customer  satisfaction  by  providing  superior
customer service and by delivering quality financial  products and services,  to
provide a stimulating and challenging work environment that encourages, develops
and rewards excellence,  and to make a meaningful  investment in the communities
Webster serves.

Assets at December  31, 1995 were $3.2  billion  compared to $3.1 billion a year
earlier.  Net loans  receivable  amounted to $1.89  billion at December 31, 1995
compared to $1.87  billion a year ago.  Deposits  were $2.40 billion at December
31, 1995 compared to $2.43 billion at December 31, 1994.

Acquisitions

The Shawmut Transaction

On  October  1, 1995,  Webster  Bank  entered  into a  Purchase  and  Assumption
Agreement  with  Shawmut  Bank   Connecticut,   as  part  of  the  Fleet/Shawmut
Divestiture, to acquire 20 former Shawmut branch banking offices in the Hartford
Banking  Market.  The Shawmut  Transaction  was consummated on February 16, 1996
with Webster Bank  receiving  approximately  $845 million in deposits,  and $586
million in loans. In connection with the Shawmut Transaction,  Webster completed
the sale of  1,249,600  shares of its  common  stock in an  underwritten  public
offering in December 1995. The Shawmut  Transaction is being  accounted for as a
purchase.  The  results of  operations  related to the  Shawmut  branch  banking
offices prior to acquisition are not included in the  accompanying  Consolidated
Financial  Statements.  Such  results  will  only be  included  for  the  period
subsequent to the consummation of the Shawmut Transaction.

The Shelton Acquisition

On November 1, 1995, Webster acquired Shelton Bancorp,  Inc. ("Shelton") and its
subsidiary,  Shelton  Savings  Bank,  a $295  million  savings  bank in Shelton,
Connecticut.  In  connection  with  the  merger  with  Shelton,  Webster  issued
1,292,549  shares of its common stock for all the outstanding  shares of Shelton
common stock. Under terms of the agreement, Shelton shareholders received .92 of
a share of Webster common stock in a tax free exchange for each of their Shelton
common shares.  This acquisition was accounted for as a pooling of interests and
as such Consolidated Financial Statements include Shelton's financial data as if
Shelton had been combined at the beginning of the earliest period presented.

Shoreline Bank and Trust Company

On  December  16,  1994,  Webster  acquired  Shoreline  Bank and  Trust  Company
("Shoreline"),   a  $51  million  asset   commercial   bank  based  in  Madison,
Connecticut.  In  connection  with the merger  with  Shoreline,  Webster  issued
266,500  shares  of its  common  stock  for  all of the  outstanding  shares  of
Shoreline  common  stock.  This  acquisition  was  accounted for as a pooling of
interests and as such the Consolidated  Financial Statements include Shoreline's
financial  data as if  Shoreline  had  been  combined  at the  beginning  of the
earliest period presented. Concurrent with the acquisition, Shoreline was merged
into the former First  Federal Bank ("First  Federal")  and its Madison  banking
office became a full service office.

Bristol Savings Bank

On March 3, 1994, Bristol Savings Bank ("Bristol")  converted from a Connecticut
mutual savings bank to a Connecticut capital stock savings bank and concurrently
became a wholly owned  subsidiary of Webster and a sister bank to First Federal.
Webster became a multiple holding company as a result of the Bristol acquisition
and  increased its assets by $486 million.  In  connection  with the  conversion
Webster  completed  the sale of 1,150,000  shares of its common stock in related
subscription and public offerings.  The Bristol acquisition was accounted for as
a purchase  and results of  operations  relating to Bristol are  included in the
accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements only for the period subsequent to
the effective date of the acquisition.  On November 1, 1995,  Webster  converted
Bristol  Savings  Bank from a state to a federal  charter  under the new name of
Webster Bank, and then merged First Federal Bank into the renamed  Webster Bank.
Webster then became a unitary holding company as a result of the merger.

FDIC Assisted Acquisitions

First  Federal  significantly  expanded its retail  banking  operations  through
assisted  acquisitions  of First  Constitution  Bank ("First  Constitution")  in
October 1992 and Suffield Bank  ("Suffield")  in September 1991 from the Federal
Deposit Insurance Corporation ("FDIC"). These acquisitions, which were accounted
for as purchases, involved financial assistance from the FDIC and extended First
Federal's  retail banking  operations  into new market areas by adding 21 branch
offices,  $1.5 billion in retail  deposits and  approximately  150,000  customer
accounts.  See Note 2 to the  Consolidated  Financial  Statements for additional
information concerning the terms of these assisted acquisitions.

Asset Quality

General

Webster devotes significant  attention to maintaining high asset quality through
conservative  underwriting  standards,  active servicing of loans,  aggressively
managing  nonperforming  assets and  maintaining  adequate  reserve  coverage on
nonaccrual  assets.  At year end 1995,  residential and consumer loans comprised
over 90% of the  loan  portfolio.  All  fixed  income  securities  must  have an
investment  rating in the top two rating categories by a major rating service at
time of purchase.

Unless otherwise noted, the information set forth concerning  loans,  nonaccrual
loans,  foreclosed properties and allowances for loan losses excludes Segregated
Assets.

Nonaccrual Assets

The aggregate amount of nonaccrual assets decreased to $55.0 million at December
31, 1995 from $61.5 million at December 31, 1994 and declined as a percentage of
total  assets to 1.71% at December  31, 1995 from 2.10% at  December  31,  1994.
Nonaccrual  loans  increased $2.9 million in 1995 which was offset by a decrease
of $9.4 million in foreclosed properties due to net proceeds received from sales
of $11.5  million.  The allowance for loan losses at December 31, 1995 was $41.8
million and represented 110.45% of nonaccrual assets.  Total loan and foreclosed
properties  allowances  for  losses  of  $42.8  million  represented  76.39%  of
nonaccrual  assets.  The following table details Webster's  nonaccrual loans and
foreclosed properties for the last five years.

</TABLE>

During 1995,  1994 and 1993  increased  loan  charge-offs  were due primarily to
loans  acquired  as  a  result  of  the   acquisitions   of  Bristol  and  First
Constitution.  Such charge-offs were in line with expectations and adequate loan
loss allowances were  established at the time of each  acquisition.  Included in
the 1994 loan  charge-offs  were  write-downs of $2.7 million  related to a bulk
sale  of  $10.0  million  of  nonperforming  residential  loans  and  foreclosed
properties.  See Note 13 to the Consolidated  Financial Statements for a summary
of activity in the  allowance for losses on  foreclosed  properties.  Management
believes that the allowance for loan losses is adequate to cover expected losses
in the loan portfolio.

Segregated Assets

Segregated  Assets  consist  of all  commercial  real  estate,  commercial,  and
multi-family loans acquired from the FDIC in the First Constitution acquisition.
Segregated  Assets,  before the allowance  for losses of $3.2 million,  totalled
$108.1  million at December 31, 1995,  down from $256.6  million at  acquisition
(1992).  Segregated  Assets are subject to a loss-sharing  arrangement  with the
FDIC.  The FDIC is required to reimburse  Webster Bank  quarterly for 80% of the
total net charge-offs and certain related expenses on Segregated Assets for five
years after  acquisition date, with such  reimbursement  increasing to 95% (less
recoveries in years six and seven) as to such charge-offs and expenses in excess
of  $49.2  million  (with  payment  at the  end of the  seventh  year as to such
excess).  The impact of  purchasing  the  Segregated  Assets has been  reflected
primarily  in  increased  noninterest  expenses  for the Bank's share of certain
reimbursable  expenses and all  non-reimbursable  expenses.  The Bank's share of
charge-offs  reduces the allowance for losses on the Segregated

                                       12

<PAGE>
Assets  which  was  established  in  conjunction  with  the  First  Constitution
acquisition.  Management  believes  that the  allowance for losses on Segregated
Assets is adequate to cover expected losses on this portfolio. See Note 5 to the
Consolidated Financial Statements.

Reimbursable  net  charge-offs  and  eligible   expenses  of  Segregated  Assets
aggregated  $7.5 million for 1995.  During  1995,  Webster  Bank  received  $6.9
million as  reimbursement  for eligible  charge-offs and related net expenses in
accordance with the loss-sharing  arrangement described above. Payments due from
the FDIC upon charge-off and related expenses are recorded as receivables.  Such
reimbursements  are made on a quarterly  basis to Webster Bank by the FDIC. When
such  reimbursements are received the funds are invested in earning assets. Such
reimbursements  have no  immediate  impact  on the  consolidated  statements  of
income.

Segregated Assets follows:

Liquidity and Capital Resources

Webster Bank is required to maintain  minimum levels of liquid assets as defined
by  regulations  adopted  by the  Office of  Thrift  Supervision  ("OTS").  This
requirement,  which may be  varied by the OTS,  is based  upon a  percentage  of
withdrawable deposits and short term borrowings. The required liquidity ratio is
currently  5.0% and Webster  Bank's  liquidity  ratio was 5.99% at December  31,
1995.

The primary  sources of liquidity for Webster Bank are cash flows from operating
activities,  investing  activities  and  financing  activities.  Cash  flow from
operating  activities include net income, loans originated for sale, the sale of
loans   originated  for  sale  and   adjustments   for  noncash  items  such  as
depreciation,  the provision for loan losses and changes in accruals.  Cash flow
from  investing  activities  includes  the  purchase,   maturity,  and  sale  of
securities and mortgage-backed securities classified as trading or available for
sale, and the net change in loans and Segregated  Assets.  While  scheduled loan
amortization and maturing  securities and short term  investments  generally are
predictable  sources of funds, loan and mortgage-backed  securities  prepayments
are greatly  influenced  by general  interest  rates,  economic  conditions  and
competition.   One  of  the  inherent  risks  of  investing  in  mortgage-backed
securities is the ability of such instruments to incur  prepayments of principal
prior to maturity at prepayment rates different than those estimated at the time
of purchase.  This generally occurs because of changes in market interest rates.
The market  values of  fixed-rate  mortgage-backed  securities  are sensitive to
fluctuations  in market  interest  rates,  declining in value as interest  rates
rise. If interest rates  decrease,  as has been the case during 1995, the market
value of mortgage-backed  securities generally will tend to increase causing the
level  of  prepayments  to  increase.  The  lower  yields  on  such  loans,  and
mortgage-backed  securities  may be offset by a lower cost of funds.  Changes in
nonaccrual  assets due to  additions  or sales of such  assets  may also  affect
liquidity.

Financing activity cash flows primarily include repayments and proceeds from FHL
Bank  advances and the net change in deposits.  The  utilization  of  particular
sources of funds depends on  comparative  costs and  availability.  Webster Bank
has,  from time to time,  chosen not to pay rates on deposits as high as certain
competitors,  and when necessary,  supplements deposits with various borrowings.
Webster  Bank  manages  the  prices  of  its  deposits  to  maintain  a  stable,
cost-effective deposit base as a source of liquidity.

Webster Bank had additional borrowing capacity from the FHL Bank of $1.4 billion
at December 31, 1995. At that date,  the Bank had FHL Bank advances  outstanding
of $383.1 million compared to $370.7 million at December 31, 1994. See Note 9 to
the Consolidated Financial Statements.

Webster's  main sources of liquidity at the holding  company level are dividends
from the Bank and capital offerings,  while the main outflows are the payment of
dividends to preferred  and common  stockholders  and the payment of interest to
holders of  Webster's 8 3/4% Senior  Notes.  There are certain  restrictions  on
payment of dividends by Webster Bank to Webster. See Note 15 to the Consolidated
Financial Statements.  Webster does not have a regulatory capital requirement at
the holding company level.

In July of 1995, Webster announced its intention to repurchase up to ten percent
of its  outstanding  common  shares from time to time over a  twenty-four  month
period. The shares purchased under the repurchase program are intended to offset
future  dilution  from shares of common  stock that may be issued in  connection
with  conversions  of  currently  convertible  preferred  stock or  issued  upon
exercise of options  under  Webster's  stock option  plans.  No shares have been
repurchased  under this current plan.  Webster  previously  repurchased  548,500
shares in two stock repurchase plans announced in 1988 and 1990.

Applicable OTS  regulations  require federal savings banks such as Webster Bank,
to satisfy certain minimum capital  requirements,  including a leverage  capital
requirement  (expressed  as a ratio of core or Tier 1 capital to adjusted  total
assets) and  risk-based  capital  requirements  (expressed as a ratio of core or
Tier 1 capital and total capital to total risked-  weighted  assets).  As an OTS
regulated  savings  institution,  Webster  Bank  also is  subject  to a  minimum
tangible  capital  requirement  (expressed  as a ratio of  tangible  capital  to
adjusted  total  assets).  At  December  31,  1995,  Webster  Bank  was in  full
compliance with all applicable capital requirements as detailed below:

The OTS issued new  regulations,  effective  January  1,  1994,  which  added an
interest-rate component to the risk-based capital requirement.  However, the OTS
has delayed  implementation of the new regulations  indefinitely.  Under the new
regulation,  an institution is considered to have excess  interest-rate  risk if
based upon a 200 basis point change in market interest  rates,  the market value
of an institution's  capital changes by more than 2%. The new interest-rate risk
requirements,  if implemented, are not expected to affect the ability of Webster
Bank to meet the risk-based capital requirements.

Asset/Liability Management

The  goal  of  Webster's   asset/liability   management   policy  is  to  manage
interest-rate  risk so as to maximize net interest  income over time in changing
interest-rate  environments while maintaining acceptable levels of risk. To this
end,  Webster's  strategies  for managing  interest-rate  risk are responsive to
changes in the interest-rate environment and market demands for particular types
of deposit and loan products.  Management measures interest-rate risk using GAP,
duration and simulation  analyses with particular  emphasis on measuring changes
in the market value of portfolio equity in different interest-rate environments.
The simulations  analyses  incorporate  assumptions  about balance sheet changes
such as asset and liability growth,  loan and deposit pricing and changes due to
the mix and  maturity of such  assets and  liabilities.  From such  simulations,
interest rate risk is quantified and appropriate strategies are formulated.  The
overall interest rate risk position is reviewed on an ongoing basis by the Asset
Liability Committee,  which includes Executive Management and has representation
by members of each line of business.  Strategies employed in 1995 to improve the
interest-rate  sensitive position included (i) the selling of certain fixed-rate
mortgage loans, (ii) promotion of adjustable-rate mortgage loans, (iii) emphasis
on the  origination  of  variable-rate  home equity credit lines and  commercial
loans, (iv) emphasis on the purchase of short-term or adjustable-rate securities
or   mortgage-backed   securities,   (v)   emphasis   on   deposits   that  meet
asset/liability  management  objectives  and  (vi)  the  employment  of  hedging
techniques to reduce the interest-rate risk of certain assets or liabilities.

Based on  Webster's  asset/liability  mix at  December  31,  1995,  management's
simulation  analysis of the effects of changing  interest rates projects that an
instantaneous  200 basis point  increase in interest  rates would  decrease  the
market  value of portfolio  equity by 10% at December 31, 1995.  At December 31,
1995,  Webster had a 4.26%  positive  GAP  position in the one year time horizon
which means that cumulative  interest-rate  sensitive  assets exceed  cumulative
interest-rate  sensitive  liabilities for that period.  Management believes that
its interest-rate risk position  represents a reasonable amount of interest-rate
risk at this point in time. Webster also utilizes as part of its asset/liability
management  strategy  various  interest rate contracts  including  short futures
positions,  interest rate swaps and interest rate caps. The notional  amounts of
these instruments are not reflected in Webster's  statement of condition but are
included in the repricing  table for purposes of analyzing  interest-rate  risk.
Interest-rate   contracts  are  entered  into  as  hedges  against  future  rate
fluctuations and not for speculative purposes.

Webster is unable to predict future  fluctuations  in interest rates and as such
the market values of certain of Webster's  financial  assets and liabilities are
sensitive to fluctuations  in market  interest rates.  Changes in interest rates
can affect the amount of loans  originated by Webster Bank, as well as the value
of its loans and other  interest-earning  assets.  The extent to which borrowers
prepay loans also is affected by prevailing  interest rates. When interest rates
increase, borrowers are less likely to prepay their loans; whereas when interest
rates decrease, borrowers are more likely to prepay their loans. Prepayments may
adversely affect the value of mortgage loans, the levels of such assets that are
retained in Webster Bank's portfolio, and net interest income and loan servicing
income. Similarly,  prepayments on mortgage-backed securities may also adversely
affect the value of these securities and interest income.  Increases in interest
rates  may  cause   depositors   to  shift  funds  from  accounts  that  have  a
comparatively  lower cost such as regular  savings  accounts to accounts  with a
higher cost such as  certificates  of deposit.  If the cost of  interest-bearing
liabilities  increase at a rate that is greater  than the  increase in yields on
interest-earning  assets,  the  interest  rate  spread is  negatively  affected.
Changes in the asset and liability mix also affects the interest rate spread.

The  following  table sets forth the estimated  maturity/repricing  structure of
Webster's  interest-earning assets and interest-bearing  liabilities at December
31, 1995.  Repricing for mortgage  loans is based on  contractual  repricing and
projected  prepayments and repayments of principal.  Deposit liabilities without
fixed  maturities  are  assumed to decay  over the  periods  presented  based on
industry standards and internal projections.

Comparison of 1995 and 1994 Years

General

For 1995, Webster reported net income of $18.3 million,  or $2.30 per share on a
fully diluted basis. Included in the 1995 results are a total of $6.4 million of
non-recurring  expenses which include:  $3.3 million of expenses  related to the
Shelton  acquisition,  $2.1 million of expenses  related to changing the name of
and  merging  together  Webster's  banking  subsidiaries,  and $1.0  million  of
expenses  related to charges  incurred in preparation  for the acquisition of 20
branch banking  offices from the former Shawmut Bank.  Also included in the 1995
results are a $2.2  million  gain on the sale of mortgage  servicing  rights and
$500,000  of  losses  on  the  sale  of   securities  as  part  of  a  portfolio
restructuring  plan. Net income for 1994 amounted to $18.7 million, or $2.44 per
share on a fully  diluted  basis.  Included in the 1994  results are $700,000 of
expenses related to the Shoreline acquisition,  a $5.0 million write-down of the
First Constitution core deposit intangible asset and income tax benefits of $4.5
million  related to a reduction of the deferred  tax asset  valuation  allowance
primarily  related  to  Bristol.   Results  for  Bristol  are  included  in  the
accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements only from the date of acquisition
on March 3, 1994.

Net Interest Income

Net interest income before the provision for loan losses  decreased $5.1 million
in 1995 to $87.3 million from $92.4 million for 1994.  The decrease is primarily
due to the fact  that the cost of  interest-bearing  liabilities  has  increased
faster than the yield on interest-earning  assets, in part due to a shift of low
cost deposits to longer term certificates of deposit.

Interest Income

Total interest income for 1995 amounted to $218.8 million,  an increase of $28.0
million,  or 14.7%,  compared to $190.8 million in 1994. This increase in income
was  due  primarily  to  an  increase  in  the  average   volume  of  loans  and
mortgage-backed  securities  and to an  increase  in the  average  yield  on all
interest-earning assets which increased to 7.20% in 1995 from 6.91% in 1994.

Interest Expense

Interest  expense  for 1995  amounted  to $131.5  million,  an increase of $33.1
million, or 33.6%,  compared to $98.5 million in 1994. This increase in interest
expense of $33.1 million was due  primarily to an increase in interest  rates of
$21.4  million  and to an  increase  in  the  average  volume  of  deposits  and
borrowings of $11.7 million.

The  following  table  shows the major  categories  of  assets  and  liabilities
together with their  respective  interest income or expense and the rates earned
and paid by Webster.

</TABLE>


Provision for Loan Losses

The provision for loan losses for 1995 was $3.1 million  versus $3.2 million for
1994.  The  allowance for losses on loans at December 31, 1995 amounted to $41.8
million and  represented  110.45% of  nonaccrual  loans versus $46.8  million or
134.04% of nonaccrual loans at December 31, 1994.

Noninterest Income

Noninterest income for 1995 amounted to $22.0 million, compared to $13.6 million
in 1994.  Fees and service charges totaled $14.1 million in 1995, an increase of
$1.9 million,  or 15.9% from 1994 due primarily to a larger customer base. Gains
on  sales  of  loans,   mortgage   loan   servicing   rights,   securities   and
mortgage-backed  securities  amounted to $4.3 million in 1995 compared to losses
of $1.2 million in 1994. The 1995 results include  non-recurring  income of $2.2
million, which represent gains on the sale of mortgage loan servicing rights and
non-recurring  losses  on  the  sale  of  securities  as  part  of  a  portfolio
restructuring  plan. Other noninterest income for 1995 amounted to $3.5 million,
an increase of $.9 million from 1994.

Noninterest Expenses

Noninterest  expenses  for 1995  amounted  to $79.6  million  compared  to $79.3
million in 1994.  The  increase of $.3  million is  primarily  due to  increased
salaries and employee benefits,  occupancy,  furniture and equipment,  and other
operating  expenses,  offset by decreases in federal deposit insurance  premiums
and foreclosed properties expenses.  Included in the 1995 results are a total of
$6.4 million of non-recurring  expenses which include:  $3.3 million of expenses
related to the Shelton acquisition, $2.1 million of expenses related to changing
the  name of and  merging  together  Webster's  banking  subsidiaries,  and $1.0
million  of  expenses  related  to  charges  incurred  in  preparation  for  the
acquisition of 20 banking offices from the former Shawmut Bank. Also included in
the 1995 results were  benefits from the  reduction of the Bank  Insurance  Fund
("BIF"),  deposit insurance premiums.  The Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation
determined  that the BIF had met its required  reserve  ratio as of June 1, 1995
and lowered the BIF premium  retroactively  to that date. There was no reduction
by the FDIC in the  premium  rates of the  Savings  Association  Insurance  Fund
("SAIF")  which has not met its required  reserve  level.  At December 31, 1995,
approximately  59% of Webster Bank's  deposits are assessed  premiums at the BIF
rate and 41% at the SAIF rate.  Deposits acquired in the Shawmut  transaction on
February  16,  1996 will be  assessed  at the lower BIF rates.  The  decrease in
foreclosed  property expenses is due to lower provisions for foreclosed property
losses  and  lower  foreclosed  property  expenses  due  to a  decrease  in  the
outstanding balance of foreclosed  properties.  Included in the 1994 results are
$700,000 of expenses  related to the  Shoreline  acquisition  and a $5.0 million
write-down  of  the  First   Constitution  core  deposit  intangible  asset.  An
evaluation  of the core  deposit  intangible  asset  at  December  31,  1995 was
performed  using a discounted  cash flow analysis.  This analysis  revealed that
there has not been any further impairment of this asset.

Income Taxes

Income tax expense for 1995 increased to $8.2 million from $4.8 million in 1994.
Included  in the 1995 and 1994  results  are $2.9  million  and $4.5  million of
benefits from the utilization of tax loss carryforwards and the reduction of the
deferred tax asset  valuation  allowance  primarily  related to Bristol  Savings
Bank.

Comparison of 1994 and 1993 Years

General For 1994,  Webster  reported net income of $18.7  million,  or $2.44 per
share on a fully  diluted  basis.  Included in the 1994 results were $700,000 of
expenses related to the Shoreline acquisition,  a $5.0 million write-down of the
First Constitution core deposit intangible asset and income tax benefits of $4.5
million  related to a reduction of the deferred tax asset  valuation  allowance.
Net income for 1993 amounted to $18.9 million and net income available to common
shareholders  was $16.2  million.  Included in the 1993  results was  cumulative
change in the method of accounting for income taxes of $4.6 million. This change
occurred  as a result of the  adoption  of  Statement  of  Financial  Accounting
Standard No. 109,  "Accounting For Income Taxes" and is discussed in more detail
in Note 14 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Operating earnings for 1994
amounted to $16.9  million or $2.44 per fully  diluted  share  compared to $11.6
million or $2.04 per fully diluted share for the same period a year earlier. The
increased  operating  earnings for 1994 were  primarily  attributed to increased
earning assets as a result of the Bristol  acquisition and lower  provisions for
loan losses.

Net Interest Income

Net interest income before the provision for loan losses increased $18.6 million
in 1994 to $92.4 million from $73.8 million for 1993. The increase was primarily
the result of higher  volumes  of  interest-earning  assets  due to the  Bristol
acquisition.

Interest Income

Total interest income for 1994 amounted to $190.8 million,  an increase of $36.2
million,  or 23.4%,  compared to 1993. This increase in income was due primarily
to an increase in the average  volume of loans,  mortgage-backed  securities and
securities acquired in the Bristol acquisition and to an increase in the average
yield on all interest-earning assets which increased to 6.91% in 1994 from 6.77%
in 1993.

Interest Expense

Interest  expense  for 1994  amounted  to $98.5  million,  an  increase of $17.7
million,  or 21.9%,  compared to 1993. The increase in interest expense of $17.7
million was  attributable  to an increase in the average  volume of deposits and
borrowings of $19.3  million and a decrease of $1.6 million  related to interest
rates.  The  increase  in volume is  primarily  attributable  to an  increase of
interest-bearing liabilities as a result of the Bristol acquisition.

Provision for Loan Losses

The provision for loan losses for 1994 was $3.2 million  versus $4.6 million for
1993.  The allowances for losses on loans at December 31, 1994 amounted to $46.8
million and  represented  134.04% of  nonaccrual  loans versus $45.2  million or
135.79% of nonaccrual loans at December 31, 1993.

Noninterest Income

Noninterest income for 1994 amounted to $13.6 million, compared to $10.7 million
in 1993.  Fees and service charges totaled $12.2 million in 1994, an increase of
$4.3 million, or 54%, from 1993 primarily due to increases in fees from checking
and deposit products and loan servicing as a result of the Bristol  acquisition.
Losses on sales of loans, securities and mortgage-backed  securities amounted to
$1.2  million  in  1994  compared  to  gains  of $1.9  million  in  1993.  Other
noninterest  income for 1994 amounted to $2.6  million,  compared to $911,000 in
1993,  an  increase  of  $1.7  million  primarily  as a  result  of the  Bristol
acquisition.

Noninterest Expenses

Noninterest  expenses  for 1994  amounted  to $79.3  million  compared  to $55.0
million in 1993.  The increase of $24.3  million is  primarily  due to increased
salaries, benefits, occupancy, furniture and equipment costs, increased premiums
for federal deposit insurance,  foreclosed  property expenses and provisions and
other noninterest expenses and are related primarily to the Bristol acquisition.
Expenses for 1994 also  included a $5.0 million  write-down  of the core deposit
intangible asset recorded in the First Constitution  acquisition and $700,000 of
expenses related to the Shoreline acquisition.  A write-down of the core deposit
intangible was deemed  necessary  after a review of the  recoverability  of this
asset was  made.  During  1994  there  were  outflows  of  regular  savings  and
certificate of deposit accounts because of overall  increases in interest rates.
In addition, because of the loss of customer accounts the ability to collect fee
income on such accounts had been reduced.  Based on these changes,  management's
estimates of fees and service charges and interest expense on deposits  indicate
that  the  original  projections  of such  amounts  will not be  achieved.  Such
analysis  was  prepared  using  a  discounted   cash  flow  analysis.   Periodic
evaluations  of the core deposit  intangible  asset will continue to be made and
such further  impairment,  if any, will be recorded as a charge to the statement
of income.  The increase in foreclosed  property expenses and provisions of $1.9
million is primarily due to increased provisions for foreclosed properties.

Income Taxes

Income tax expense for 1994 decreased to $4.9 million from $10.6 million in 1993
due to benefits from the utilization of tax loss carryforwards and the reduction
of the  deferred tax asset  valuation  allowance  primarily  relating to Bristol
Savings Bank.  Included in the 1993 results is a cumulative change in the method
of  accounting  for income  taxes of $4.6 million as a result of the adoption of
Financial  Accounting Standard No. 109,  "Accounting for Income Taxes", which is
discussed in more detail in Note 14 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.

Impact of Inflation and Changing Prices

The financial statements and related data presented herein have been prepared in
accordance  with generally  accepted  accounting  principles,  which require the
measurement of financial  position and operating  results in terms of historical
dollars without  considering  changes in the relative  purchasing power of money
over time due to inflation.

Unlike most industrial companies, virtually all of the assets and liabilities of
a banking institution are monetary in nature. As a result, interest rates have a
more significant impact on a banking institution's  performance than the effects
of general levels of inflation.  Interest rates do not  necessarily  move in the
same direction or in the same  magnitude as the price of goods and services.  In
the current  interest  rate  environment,  the  maturity  structure of Webster's
assets and liabilities are critical to the maintenance of acceptable performance
levels.

Recent Financial Accounting Standards

In October 1995,  the  Financial  Accounting  Standards  Board  ("FASB")  issued
Statement of Financial  Accounting  Standard No. 123 "Accounting for Stock-Based
Compensation." This statement encourages all companies to adopt a new fair value
based  method  of  accounting  for  stock  compensation  plans  in  place of the
intrinsic value method prescribed by Accounting Principals Board ("APB") Opinion
25. In adopting the fair value based method,  companies will record compensation
cost related to activity with their stock-based  compensation  plans.  Companies
that  choose to  continue to account  for stock-  based  compensation  under the
provision  of APB  Opinion 25 will be  required  to  disclose  the impact on net
income and  earnings  per share as if they had  adopted  the fair value  method.
Webster does not plan to adopt the fair value method.  This standard  applies to
financial  statements  for fiscal  years  beginning  after  December  31,  1994.
Calendar year companies will first be required to disclose  comparable pro forma
net income  and  earnings  per share for 1995 and 1996 in their  1996  financial
statements.

In May 1995, the FASB issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 122
("SFAS No. 122") "Accounting for Mortgage Servicing  Rights",  which amends SFAS
No. 65 "Accounting for Certain Mortgage Banking  Activities." Under SFAS No. 65,
mortgage  servicing rights were required to be capitalized only if servicing was
purchased but prohibited  separate  capitalization of mortgage  servicing rights
when acquired through loan portfolio sales with servicing rights retained.  SFAS
No. 122 requires that a mortgage  banking  entity  recognize as a separate asset
the value of the right to service  mortgage loans for others,  regardless of how
those servicing rights are acquired.  Additionally, SFAS No. 122 requires that a
mortgage  banking entity assess its capitalized  mortgage  servicing  rights for
impairment and establish  valuation  allowances based on the fair value of those
servicing  rights,  which include those  servicing  rights acquired prior to the
adoption of SFAS No. 122. As allowed  under the  provisions  of this  statement,
Webster  elected early adoption of SFAS No. 122 on July 1, 1995. At December 31,
1995,  the fair value of all mortgage  servicing  rights  approximates  its book
value of $2.6 million, therefore, no valuation allowance was recorded.

In October 1994, the FASB issued statement of Financial  Accounting Standard No.
119 ("SFAS 119"),  "Disclosures about Derivative Financial  Instruments and Fair
Value  of  Financial  Instruments."  This  statement  requires  institutions  to
disclose the average fair value of derivative  instruments  as well as net gains
and losses arising from trading revenues.  Webster currently holds short futures
positions to minimize the price  volatility  of certain  adjustable-rate  assets
held as  Trading  Securities.  Changes  in the  market  value of  short  futures
positions are  recognized  in the  statements of income as a gain or loss in the
period for which the change occurred.  Webster also holds various  interest-rate
financial  instruments  in the form of  interest  rate  swaps and caps as hedges
against  increases in interest  rates.  This  statement is effective  for fiscal
years ending after December 15, 1994. See Notes 3 and 11.

In November 1993, the Accounting  Standards Executive Committee issued Statement
of Position 93-6,  "Employers'  Accounting for Employee Stock Ownership  Plans."
This statement  requires  institutions  with employee stock  ownership  plans to
record compensation  expense equivalent to the fair value of shares committed to
be released to employees.  Shares not committed to be released are excluded from
outstanding  shares for the calculation of net income per share. Such provisions
are not  required  for  employee  stock  ownership  plan shares  issued prior to
December 31, 1992. On March 3, 1994, in conjunction  with the  subscription  and
public  offerings  of 1,150,000  shares of common stock of Webster,  the Webster
Bank Employee Stock  Ownership Plan purchased  100,000  additional  shares.  The
implementation  of Statement of Position 93-6 did not have an effect on earnings
for 1994 since no shares  related to the  purchase  were  committed  for release
during 1994.  During 1995, 4,127 shares were released and the impact on earnings
was $85,000 before income taxes. The exclusion of the additional  employee stock
ownership  plan shares not  committed  to be  released  does not have a material
effect on the computation of net income per share.

In May 1993, the FASB issued Statement of Financial  Accounting Standard No. 115
("SFAS  115"),   "Accounting   for  Certain   Investments  in  Debt  and  Equity
Securities." As allowed under the provisions of this statement,  Webster elected
early  adoption of SFAS No. 115 on December  31,  1993.  The early  adoption and
implementation of SFAS No. 115 did not

                                       21

have  a  material  affect  on  the  financial  statements.  See  Note  1 to  the
Consolidated Financial Statements for a discussion of SFAS No. 115.

In May 1993,  the  Financial  Accounting  Standards  Board  issued SFAS No. 114,
"Accounting  by Creditors for  Impairment of a Loan." Under SFAS No. 114, a loan
is  considered  impaired when it is probable that the creditor will be unable to
collect  amounts due, both principal and interest,  according to the contractual
terms of the loan  agreement.  This  statement does not apply to large groups of
small-balance  homogeneous loans that are collectively  evaluated for impairment
such as residential and consumer loans. When a loan is impaired,  a creditor has
a choice of ways to measure  impairment.  The factors used to measure impairment
include:  (i) the present  value of expected  future cash flows of the  impaired
loan  discounted  at the  loan's  original  effective  interest  rate,  (ii) the
observable  market  price of the  impaired  loan or (iii) the fair  value of the
collateral of the  collateral-dependent  loan. When a loan has been deemed to be
impaired,   a  valuation  allowance  is  established  for  the  amount  of  such
impairment.

Webster considers its residential and consumer loan portfolios to be exempt from
the  provisions  of  SFAS  No.  114  since  these  loans  are  large  groups  of
small-balance homogeneous loans collectively evaluated for determining loan loss
allowances.  In identifying impaired loans under the provisions of SFAS No. 114,
Webster  aggregates  loans  into risk  classifications  and makes an  individual
assessment  of each  borrower's  ability to repay  based upon  current  contract
terms.  If it is  determined  that the borrower  will not be able to fulfill the
terms of the original  contract,  the loan is classified  as impaired.  Impaired
loans differ from nonaccrual  loans based upon the following:  nonaccrual  loans
are loans which are  contractually  past due 90 days or more as to  principal or
interest payments.  In addition, a loan may be placed on nonaccrual status based
on uncertainty as to future principal or interest payments.  In comparison,  the
measurement of impaired loans is more  subjective due to the use of estimates of
future cash flows.

There is no  difference  in Webster's  charge-off  policy for impaired  loans as
compared to other loans  classified  as  nonaccrual  or  risk-rated by category.
Loans are  charged-off  to the loan loss or impaired loan loss  allowances  when
management  determines  that a portion of the book value of the loan will not be
recovered  either through  principal  repayment or liquidation of the underlying
collateral.

In October 1994, the Financial  Accounting  Standards Board issued SFAS No. 118,
"Accounting  by Creditors  for  Impairment  of a Loan - Income  Recognition  and
Disclosure",  amending  SFAS No. 114.  SFAS No. 118 allows  institutions  to use
existing  methods for recognizing  interest income on impaired loans.  Webster's
policy  with regard to the  recognition  of  interest  income on impaired  loans
includes an individual  assessment of each loan.  Interest which is more than 90
days past due is not  accrued.  When  payments on impaired  loans are  received,
Webster records  interest income on a cash basis or applies the total payment to
principal based on an individual assessment of each loan.

Recent Proposed Legislation

Legislation  has been  introduced in the United States House of  Representatives
("House")  that would  eliminate  the  federal  savings  association  charter by
January 1, 1998. If such  legislation is enacted,  Wester Bank would be required
to convert its federal savings charter to either a national bank charter or to a
state depository  institution  charter.  Pending  legislation also may result in
Webster  becoming  regulated  at the  holding  company  level  by the  Board  of
Governors of the Federal Reserve System ("Federal Reserve") rather than the OTS.
Regulation by the Federal Reserve could subject Webster to capital  requirements
that are not  currently  applicable  to Webster as a holding  company  under OTS
regulation  and may  result in  statutory  limitations  on the type of  business
activities  in which  Webster may engage at the  holding  company  level,  which
business  activities  currently are not restricted.  The pending  legislation is
expected  to  provide  relief as to  recapture  of the bad debt  deduction  that
otherwise  would be  applicable  if Webster  Bank were  unable to  continue as a
qualified  savings  institution  for federal tax purposes.  Webster is unable to
predict whether such legislation will be enacted or, if enacted, whether it will
contain relief as to bad debt deductions previously taken by Webster Bank.

Savings Association Insurance Fund Recapitalization

The current  financial  condition  of the  Savings  Association  Insurance  Fund
("SAIF") has resulted in the  introduction  of various  legislation  in both the
United States Senate  ("Senate") and the House to recapitalize the SAIF and then
to merge the SAIF into the Bank  Insurance  Fund  ("BIF").  Both the  Senate and
House  legislation,  as currently  proposed,  would  generally  impose a special
one-time  assessment  of  approximately  85 cents  per $100 of  assessable  SAIF
deposits at March 31, 1995.  Depending upon the final form of this  legislation,
the special assessment may apply  retroactively to approximately $882 million of
assessable SAIF deposits at Webster Bank.  After the special  assessment,  it is
proposed  that SAIF premium  rates would then be the same as BIF rates until the
funds are merged, which would significantly reduce Webster Bank's future federal
deposit  insurance  premiums.  Webster  Bank is unable to predict  whether  this
legislation  will be enacted,  the amount or applicable  retroactive date of any
one-time  assessment  or the rates  that would  then  apply to  assessable  SAIF
deposits.

Notes To Consolidated Financial Statements

Note 1
Summary of Significant Accounting Policies

a)  Business
Webster   Financial   Corporation   ("Webster"),   headquartered  in  Waterbury,
Connecticut,  is the holding  company for Webster  Bank,  a federally  chartered
savings  bank  ("Webster  Bank"  or "the  Bank").  Webster  Bank is  engaged  in
consumer, commercial and mortgage banking primarily in Connecticut. Webster Bank
attracts  deposits  from retail and business  customers  and obtains  additional
funds through Federal Home Loan Bank ("FHL Bank") advances and other borrowings.
Webster Bank invests its funds in residential  first mortgage loans,  commercial
and industrial loans,  commercial real estate loans, home equity loans, consumer
installment  loans and securities.  Webster Bank currently serves customers from
64 banking offices  located in Hartford,  New Haven,  Fairfield,  and Litchfield
Counties in Connecticut.

Webster Bank's predecessor,  First Federal Bank, a federal savings bank, ("First
Federal") was founded in 1935 and converted  from a federal  mutual to a federal
stock  institution in 1986. On March 3, 1994,  Webster became a multiple holding
company  upon   consummation   of  the   acquisition  of  Bristol  Savings  Bank
("Bristol").  See Note 2. Bristol,  founded in 1870, was a Connecticut-chartered
savings bank headquartered in Bristol,  Connecticut. On November 1, 1995, in the
following sequence: (i) Bristol converted from a state savings bank charter to a
federal savings bank charter and was concurrently  renamed as Webster Bank, (ii)
First  Federal Bank merged into Webster  Bank,  as the  surviving  savings bank,
(iii) Webster acquired Shelton  Bancorp,  Inc.  ("Shelton") and its wholly-owned
subsidiary,  Shelton Savings Bank, through a merger of a wholly-owned subsidiary
of Webster formed for such purpose into Shelton,  as the surviving  corporation,
(iv) Shelton then merged into  Webster,  as the surviving  corporation,  and (v)
thereafter  Shelton  Savings Bank merged into Webster Bank.  The  acquisition of
Shelton was accounted for as a pooling of interests. See Note 2.

b)  Basis of Financial Statement Presentation

The consolidated  financial  statements  include the accounts of Webster and the
Bank.  The  consolidated   financial  statements  and  notes  hereto  have  been
retroactively  restated to include the accounts of Shelton  acquired on November
1, 1995 and  Shoreline  Bank and Trust and  Company  ("Shoreline")  acquired  on
December 16, 1994 as if the mergers had occurred at the  beginning of the period
of the earliest date presented.  The financial  statements have been prepared in
conformity  with generally  accepted  accounting  principles and all significant
intercompany transactions have been eliminated in consolidation.

In preparing the financial statements,  management is required to make estimates
and assumptions  that affect the reported amount of assets and liabilities as of
the date of the  balance  sheets  and  revenues  and  expenses  for the  periods
presented.  The actual  results of Webster  could  differ from those  estimates.
Material  estimates  that are  susceptible  to near  term  changes  include  the
determination of the allowance for loan losses,  the valuation  allowance of the
deferred tax asset and the valuation of foreclosed property.

c)  Allowance for Loan Losses

An  allowance  for loan  losses is  established  based upon a review of the loan
portfolio,  loss  experience,  specific  problem loans,  current and anticipated
economic conditions and other pertinent factors which, in management's judgment,
deserve current recognition in estimating loan losses.


                                       29

<PAGE>


Management  believes  that the  allowance  for loan  losses is  adequate.  While
management  uses  available  information  to recognize  losses on loans,  future
additions  to the  allowance  may be  necessary  based on  changes  in  economic
conditions.  In addition,  various regulatory  agencies,  as an integral part of
their  examination  process,  periodically  review Webster's  allowance for loan
losses.  Such  agencies  may  require  Webster  to  recognize  additions  to the
allowance for loan losses based on judgments different from those of management.

d)  Foreclosed Properties

Foreclosed  Properties  consists  of  properties  acquired  through  foreclosure
proceedings  or  acceptance  of  a  deed  in  lieu  of  foreclosure.  Foreclosed
Properties  are  reported  at the lower of fair  value  less  estimated  selling
expenses or cost with an allowance for losses to provide for declines in values.
Operating  expenses are charged to current period  earnings and gains and losses
upon disposition are reflected in the statements of income when realized.

e)  Loans

Loans are stated at the  principal  amounts  outstanding.  Interest  on loans is
credited  to income as earned  based on the rate  applied to  principal  amounts
outstanding.  Interest which is more than 90 days past due is not accrued.  Such
interest  ultimately  collected,  if any,  is  credited  to income in the period
received.  Loan  origination  fees net of certain direct  origination  costs and
premiums and discounts on loans purchased are recognized in interest income over
the lives of the loans using a method  approximating the interest method.  Loans
held for sale are carried at the lower of cost or market value in aggregate. Net
unrealized  losses on loans held for sale, if any, are recognized in a valuation
allowance by charges to income.

f)  Securities and Mortgage-backed Securities

On December  31, 1993  Webster  adopted  SFAS No. 115,  "Accounting  for Certain
Investments in Debt and Equity  Securities." This statement requires  securities
to be classified into one of three categories.  Securities with fixed maturities
that management has the intent and ability to hold to maturity are classified as
Held to Maturity and are carried at cost,  adjusted for amortization of premiums
and accretion of discounts over the estimated terms of the securities  utilizing
a method which  approximates the level yield method.  Securities that management
intends  to hold for  indefinite  periods  of time,  including  securities  that
management intends to use as part of its asset/liability  strategy,  or that may
be sold in response to changes in interest  rates,  changes in prepayment  risk,
the need to increase regulatory capital or other similar factors, are classified
as Available for Sale.  All Equity  Securities  are  classified as Available for
Sale.  Securities  Available for Sale are carried at fair value with  unrealized
gains and  losses  recorded  as  adjustments  to  shareholders'  equity on a tax
effected basis.  Securities classified as Trading Securities are carried at fair
value with unrealized gains and losses included in earnings. Gains and losses on
the sales of securities are recorded using the specific identification method.

Mortgage-backed  securities include collateralized mortgage obligations ("CMOs")
which are either U.S.  government agency securities or are rated in at least the
top two rating  categories by at least one of the major rating  agencies at time
of  purchase.   One  of  the  risks   inherent   when   investing  in  CMOs  and
mortgage-backed   securities  is  the  ability  of  such  instruments  to  incur
prepayments  of  principal  prior  to  maturity.  Because  of  prepayments,  the
weighted-average  yield of these securities may also change,  which would effect
earnings.

g)  Interest-rate Instruments

Webster  utilizes as part of its asset  liability  management  strategy  various
interest rate contracts  including short futures positions,  interest rate swaps
and interest rate caps.  Webster  holds short futures  positions to minimize the
price volatility of certain  adjustable rate assets held as Trading  Securities.
Changes in the market value of short futures  positions are recognized as a gain
or loss in the  consolidated  statement  of income in the  period  for which the
change occurred.

Interest rate caps and swaps are entered into as hedges against future  interest
rate  fluctuations.   Webster  does  not  trade  in  speculative  interest  rate
contracts.  Those agreements meeting the criteria for hedge accounting treatment
are  designated  as hedges  and are  accounted  for as such.  If a  contract  is
terminated,  any  unrecognized  gain or loss is  deferred  and  amortized  as an
adjustment to the yield of the related asset or liability  over the remainder of
the period that is

                                       30

<PAGE>

being managed.  If the linked asset or liability is disposed of prior to the end
of the period being  managed,  the related  interest  rate contract is marked to
fair value,  with any resulting gain or loss recognized in current period income
as an  adjustment  to the gain or loss on the  disposal of the related  asset or
liability.  Interest  income or expense  associated  with interest rate caps and
swaps is recorded as a component of net interest income.  Interest rate caps and
swaps that hedge available for sale assets are marked to fair value monthly with
adjustments to shareholders' equity on a tax effected basis.

h)  Interest-bearing Deposits

Interest-bearing Deposits consist primarily of deposits in the Federal Home Loan
Bank of Boston.  These  deposits are carried at cost which  approximates  market
value.

i)  Premises and Equipment

Depreciation of premises and equipment is accumulated on a  straight-line  basis
over the estimated useful lives of the related assets. Estimated lives are 15 to
40  years  for  buildings  and  improvements  and 3 to 20 years  for  furniture,
fixtures and equipment.  Amortization of leasehold improvements is calculated on
a straight-line basis over the terms of the related leases.

Maintenance and repairs are charged to expense as incurred and  improvements are
capitalized.  The cost and  accumulated  depreciation  relating to premises  and
equipment retired or otherwise  disposed of are eliminated from the accounts and
any resulting gains and losses are credited or charged to income.

j)  Segregated Assets

Segregated Assets represent commercial,  commercial real estate and multi-family
loans acquired in the October 1992 First Constitution acquisition.  In addition,
Segregated  Assets  contain  foreclosed  properties  that has been so classified
subsequent to the acquisition  date.  These assets are subject to a loss-sharing
arrangement with the FDIC as discussed in Notes 2 and 5.

Interest on Segregated Assets is credited to income earned on loans based on the
rate applied to principal  amounts  outstanding.  Interest which is more than 90
days contractually past due is not accrued.  Such interest ultimately collected,
if any, is credited to income in the period received.

k)  Core Deposit Intangible

The excess of the purchase  price over the fair value of the tangible net assets
acquired  has been  allocated  to  deposits.  The  deposit  intangible  is being
amortized  on a  straight-line  basis over a period of ten years.  On a periodic
basis,  management assesses the recoverability of the deposit  intangible.  Such
assessments  encompass a projection of future  earnings from the deposit base as
compared to original  expectations,  based upon a discounted cash flow analysis.
If an assessment of the intangible  indicates  that it is impaired,  a charge to
income for the most recent period is recorded for the amount of such impairment.

l)  Income Taxes

Deferred  tax  assets  and   liabilities  are  recognized  for  the  future  tax
consequences   attributable  to  differences  between  the  financial  statement
carrying  amounts of existing assets and  liabilities  and their  respective tax
bases.  Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates
expected  to apply to  taxable  income  in the  years in which  those  temporary
differences  are expected to be recovered or settled.  Under  Statement 109, the
effect  on  deferred  tax  assets  and  liabilities  of a change in tax rates is
recognized  in income in the period that includes the  enactment  date.  Webster
adopted  Statement 109 on January 1, 1993 and has reported the cumulative effect
of that change in the statement of income for the year ended December 31, 1993.


                                       31

<PAGE>

m)  Employee Benefit Plans

The  Bank  has  a  noncontributory   pension  plan  covering  substantially  all
employees.  Pension  costs are accrued in  accordance  with  generally  accepted
accounting   principles  (SFAS  87)  and  are  funded  in  accordance  with  the
requirements of the Employee  Retirement  Income Security Act (ERISA).  The Bank
also accrues costs related to postretirement benefits (SFAS 106).

n)  Net Income Per Share

Primary net income per share is calculated  by dividing net income  available to
common shareholders by the weighted-average number of shares of common stock and
common  stock  equivalents   outstanding,   when  dilutive.   The  common  stock
equivalents consist of common stock options.  Fully diluted net income per share
is  calculated  by dividing  adjusted net income by the  weighted-average  fully
diluted common shares,  including the effect of common stock equivalents and the
hypothetical conversion into common stock of the Series B cumulative convertible
preferred stock. The  weighted-average  number of shares used in the computation
of primary  earnings per share for the years ended  December 31, 1995,  1994 and
1993 were 6,969,208, 6,306,994 and 5,177,399, respectively and for fully diluted
earnings per share were 7,970,921, 7,650,343 and 6,621,158 for the same periods,
respectively.

o)  Statements of Cash Flows

For purposes of the Statements of Cash Flows, Webster considers cash on hand and
in banks to be cash equivalents.

p)  Loan Sales and Servicing Sales

Gains or  losses on sales of loans are  recognized  at the time of the sale.  On
July  1,  1995,  Webster  elected  early  adoption  of  Statement  of  Financial
Accounting  Standard No. 122 ("SFAS No. 122") "Accounting for Mortgage Servicing
Rights." SFAS No. 122 requires  that a mortgage  banking  entity  recognize as a
separate  asset the value of the right to  service  mortgage  loans for  others,
regardless of how those servicing rights are acquired. See Note 4.

When loans sold have an average  contractual  interest rate, adjusted for normal
servicing costs, which differs from the agreed yield to the purchaser,  gains or
losses are recognized equal to the present value of such  differential  over the
estimated  remaining life of such loans.  Any resulting net premium is amortized
over the same estimated life using a method  approximating  the interest method.
The aggregate of unamortized  excess servicing rights arising from gains on loan
sales is included in the accompanying  Consolidated Statements of Condition as a
component of Prepaid Expenses and Other Assets and is periodically  reviewed and
adjusted for changed circumstances.

q)  Reclassifications

Certain  financial   statement   balances  as  previously   reported  have  been
reclassified  to  conform  to  the  1995   consolidated   financial   statements
presentation. All per share data and the number of outstanding common shares for
all periods and dates have been adjusted  retroactively  to give effect to stock
dividends  to  common  shareholders  of  record.  In  addition,   all  financial
statements  presented  have been  retroactively  restated  to give effect to the
acquisition of Shelton,  completed on November 1, 1995,  which was accounted for
as a pooling of interests,  and to the  acquisition  of Shoreline,  completed on
December 16, 1994,  which was also accounted for as a pooling of interests.  See
Note  2  for  additional   information   regarding  the  Shoreline  and  Shelton
acquisitions.


Note 2
Acquisitions
Pooling of Interests Transactions

On November 1, 1995, Webster acquired Shelton, with $295 million in assets based
in Shelton,  Connecticut.  In connection  with the  acquisition,  Webster issued
1,292,549  shares  of its  common  stock  for all of the  outstanding  shares of
Shelton  common stock,  based on an exchange  ratio of .92 of a share of Webster
common stock for each of Shelton's outstanding shares of common stock.

                                       32

<PAGE>

On December 16, 1994,  Webster acquired  Shoreline,  with $51 million in assets,
based in Madison,  Connecticut. In connection with the acquisition of Shoreline,
Webster  issued  266,500  shares of its common stock for all of the  outstanding
shares of  Shoreline  common  stock,  based on an  exchange  ratio of 1 share of
Webster's common stock for 2 shares of Shoreline's  common stock.  Shoreline was
merged into the Bank on the acquisition date.

Both  acquisitions  were accounted for as a pooling of interests and as such the
consolidated  financial statements include financial data as if both Shelton and
Shoreline  had  been  combined  as of  the  beginning  of  the  earliest  period
presented.

The following  table sets forth separate  results of operations of the combining
entities:

Shelton  acquisition,  $2.1 million of expenses  related to changing the name of
and  merging  together  Webster's  banking  subsidiaries,  and $1.0  million  of
expenses  related to charges  incurred in the preparation for the acquisition of
20  banking  offices  from the former  Shawmut  Bank  which was  consummated  on
February 16, 1996.  Included in the 1994 Statement of Income are $5.7 million of
non-recurring  expenses  which  include a $5.0 million  write-down  of the First
Constitution  core  deposit  intangible  asset  (See Note 7),  and  $700,000  of
expenses related to the Shoreline acquisition.

Purchase Transactions

The Shawmut Transaction

On October 1, 1995,  Webster Bank's  predecessor,  First Federal  entered into a
Purchase and Assumption Agreement with Shawmut Bank Connecticut,  as part of the
Fleet/Shawmut  Divestiture,  to acquire 20 Shawmut branch banking offices in the
Hartford Banking Market. The Shawmut Transaction was consummated on February 16,
1996, with Webster Bank receiving  approximately  $845 million in deposits,  and
$586 million in loans.  In connection  with the Shawmut  Transaction on December
15, 1995,  Webster completed the sale of 1,249,600 shares of its common stock in
an underwritten public offering.  The Shawmut Transaction is being accounted for
as a purchase and the results of operations  related to Shawmut's branch banking
offices are not included in the accompanying  Consolidated Financial Statements.
Such results  will be included  subsequent  to February  16,  1996,  the date of
consummation of the acquisition.

Bristol Savings Bank Acquisition

On March 3, 1994,  Bristol converted from a Connecticut mutual savings bank to a
Connecticut  capital stock savings bank and  concurrently  became a wholly-owned
subsidiary  of  Webster  and a  sister  bank  to  First  Federal  ("the  Bristol
acquisition").   Bristol,   founded  in  1870,  was  headquartered  in  Bristol,
Connecticut  and had 5 banking  offices in  Hartford  County.  Webster  became a
multiple holding company as a result of the Bristol  acquisition.  In connection
with the  conversion,  Webster  completed  the sale of  1,150,000  shares of its
common  stock  in  related  subscription  and  public  offerings.   The  Bristol
acquisition was accounted for as a purchase,  and results of operations relating
to Bristol  from March 3, 1994 are  included  in the  accompanying  Consolidated
Financial  Statements.  Negative  goodwill of $2.3 million  represented  the net
effect of all purchase accounting  adjustments and is recorded as a reduction of
premises and equipment.

First Constitution Acquisition

On October 2, 1992, Webster Bank's predecessor,  First Federal, acquired most of
the  assets,  all of  the  deposits  and  certain  other  liabilities  of  First
Constitution Bank ("First Constitution"),  New Haven, Connecticut, from the FDIC
in  an  assisted  transaction  (the  "First  Constitution   acquisition").   The
acquisition  increased First Federal's  assets by over $1.3 billion and added 14
banking offices in New Haven County and two banking offices in Fairfield County.

The financial terms of the First Constitution  acquisition included five primary
components.  First,  the FDIC made a cash  purchase of $30 million of  Webster's
Series A Cumulative  Perpetual  Preferred Stock (the "Series A Stock").  Webster
redeemed  $11.75  million of the  Series A Stock on  December  30,  1992 and the
remaining  $18.25  million on June 29, 1993.  Second,  First Federal  received a
$24.2 million cash payment from the FDIC to purchase  certain  assets and assume
certain  liabilities  of First  Constitution  in the  acquisition.  The  payment
increased cash, which was offset on the  consolidated  statement of condition by
various  adjustments  reflecting the market value of the assets and  liabilities
acquired,  and had no impact on the  consolidated  statement  of  income.  First
Federal purchased  approximately  $1.3 billion of First  Constitution's  assets,
including:  $817 million in one-to-four  family home loans;  $30 million in home
equity loans; $34 million in consumer loans; $257 million in "Segregated Assets"
(consisting of multi-family,  commercial and commercial real estate loans);  and
$155  million  in  cash,  cash   equivalents,   U.S.   agency   obligations  and
mortgage-backed securities.  First Federal assumed approximately $1.2 billion in
deposit balances of First Constitution (including  approximately $300 million of
brokered  or  out-of-state  deposits,  most of  which  were  withdrawn  prior to
December  31,  1992 as  planned  by  First  Federal)  and $29  million  of other
borrowings and liabilities.  Third, the FDIC retained approximately $225 million
of First  Constitution's  higher-risk assets,  including other real estate owned
("OREO"), "in-substance foreclosed" loans, commercial loan participations,  real
estate investments, and investments in subsidiaries.  Fourth, the FDIC agreed to
reimburse  First  Federal  quarterly  for 80% of the total net  charge-offs  and
certain related  expenses on all Segregated  Assets purchased in the acquisition
for five years after the acquisition date, with such reimbursement increasing to
95% (less recoveries in years six and seven) as to

                                       34

<PAGE>

such  charge-offs  and expenses in excess of $49.2  million (with payment at the
end of the seventh year as to such excess).


Fifth, the FDIC also agreed to reimburse First Federal,  as a contingent reserve
payment,  for 80% of the  excess  over $52  million  for four  years  after  the
acquisition date, up to a maximum  reimbursement of $20 million of (i) the total
net charge-offs on all First  Constitution  one-to-four family home, home equity
and consumer  loans  purchased  in the  acquisition  plus (ii) the  unreimbursed
portion  of the  total net  charge-offs  and  certain  related  expenses  on the
Segregated Assets. As part of the First Constitution acquisition,  First Federal
established  a  reserve  for the  estimated  unreimbursed  portion  of losses on
Segregated  Assets of $10.7 million and an  additional  reserve of $46.5 million
for the estimated unreimbursed portion of losses on the one-to-four family home,
home equity and consumer  loans acquired in the First  Constitution  acquisition
(including those held for sale).

Suffield Bank Acquisition

In September 1991, Webster's predecessor, First Federal, acquired certain assets
and  liabilities of Suffield Bank,  Suffield,  Connecticut,  from the FDIC in an
assisted transaction in which First Federal received a $2.5 million cash payment
from the FDIC in connection  with the  acquisition  to reflect its negative bid.
This acquisition  involved an assumption of $247 million of deposit  liabilities
(including $93 million of brokered and out-of-state  deposits) and $5 million of
other liabilities and a purchase of $48 million of performing one-to-four family
home loans,  passbook loans and installment  loans and $26 million of cash, cash
equivalents and U.S. agency  obligations.  In addition,  First Federal  received
$181  million in cash from the FDIC,  representing  the  difference  between the
liabilities assumed less the assets purchased.

During 1995, sales from the available for sale portfolio  consisted of treasury,
agency,  mortgage-backed  securities  and equities.  There were no sales of debt
securities from the held to maturity  portfolio for the years ended December 31,
1995 and 1994.  During the 1995 fourth quarter the Bank elected under guidelines
issued  by  the  Financial   Accounting  Standards  Board  to  transfer  certain
securities from the held to maturity to the available for sale portfolio.  These
securities had an approximate book value of $301.4 million and fair market value
of $299.9 million. Under this one-time provision,  the Bank was able to reassess
the appropriateness of the classifications of all securities and account for any
resulting  reclassifications  at fair market value.  This  one-time  election to
reclassify  securities  was required to be  completed by December 31, 1995.  The
Bank reclassified  certain  securities to allow greater  flexibility in managing
interest-rate  risk and to  enhance  its  ability  to react to changes in market
conditions.

maturity portfolios follow:

Included  above at  December  31,  1995 and 1994 are $466.9  million  and $531.5
million,  respectively, of residential and consumer loans acquired from the FDIC
in the First Constitution  acquisition ("Reserve Assets").  For four years after
the acquisition  date, the FDIC is required to reimburse the Bank quarterly,  in
an aggregate  amount up to $20 million,  for 80% of all net  charge-offs  on the
Reserve Assets and the Bank's share of net charge-offs  and expenses  associated
with Segregated Assets ("Webster Bank's Shared Losses"),  if such charge-offs on
the Reserve Assets and Webster Bank's portion of the Shared Losses  collectively
exceed $52 million.  Cumulative net charge-offs on Reserve Assets and the Bank's
share of net  charge-offs and expenses  associated  with Segregated  Assets from
acquisition  date through 1995 totaled  $34.7  million.  No  contingent  reserve
payments  will be made by the FDIC  after  expiration  of the  four-year  period
following the acquisition date. The Bank established $46.5 million in allowances
for loan  losses  and  allowances  for  loans  held for  sale  through  purchase
accounting adjustments to cover its portion of losses on the Reserve Assets.

Webster  adopted SFAS No. 114 "Accounting by Creditors for Impairment of a Loan"
on January 1, 1995, with no impact on its results of operations. At December 31,
1995,  Webster had $9.3  million of impaired  loans,  of which $4.5  million was
measured based upon the fair value of the underlying collateral and $4.8 million
was measured based upon the expected future cash flows of the impaired loans. Of
the total impaired loans of $9.3 million, $6.9 million had allowances for losses
on impaired  loans of $2.1  million.  In 1995,  the average  balance of impaired
loans was  $12.8  million.  The  allowance  for  losses  on  impaired  loans was
established as a result of an allocation from the allowance for losses on loans.

In October 1994, the Financial  Accounting  Standards Board issued SFAS No. 118,
"Accounting  by Creditors  for  Impairment  of a Loan - Income  Recognition  and
Disclosure",  amending  SFAS No. 114.  SFAS No. 118 allows  institutions  to use
existing  methods for recognizing  interest income on impaired loans.  Webster's
policy  with regard to the  recognition  of  interest  income on impaired  loans
includes an individual  assessment of each loan.  Interest which is more than 90
days past due is not  accrued.  When  payments on impaired  loans are  received,
Webster records  interest income on a cash basis or applies the total payment to
principal  based on an individual  assessment of each loan.  Cash basis interest
income  recognized on impaired  loans for the twelve  months ended  December 31,
1995 amounted to $50,362.

Webster is a party to financial  instruments with off-balance sheet risk to meet
the  financing  needs  of its  customers  and to  reduce  its  own  exposure  to
fluctuations in interest rates. These financial instruments included commitments
to extend credit and commitments to sell residential first mortgage loans. These
instruments  involve,  to varying degrees,  elements of credit and interest-rate
risk in excess of the amount recognized on the balance sheet.

The fair value of commitments to extend credit is considered to approximate  the
contract amount.  Future loan commitments  represent  residential  mortgage loan
commitments,  letters of credit,  standby  letters  of credit,  and unused  home
equity credit lines.  Rates for these loans are  generally  established  shortly
before  closing.  The rates on home  equity  lines of credit vary with the prime
rate.

At  December  31, 1995 and 1994  residential  mortgage  commitments  outstanding
totaled $45.8 million and $35.2 million,  respectively.  Residential commitments
outstanding at December 31, 1995 consist of adjustable and fixed-rate  mortgages
of $17.4 million and $28.4 million,  respectively, at rates ranging from 4.8% to
9.8%.  Commitments  to  originate  loans  generally  expire  within 60 days.  In
addition,  at  December  31, 1995 and 1994,  there were unused  portions of home
equity credit lines  extended by Webster of $158.5  million and $100.1  million,
respectively.  Unused  commercial  lines of credit,  letters of credit,  standby
letters of credit and outstanding  commercial new loan commitments totaled $40.3
million and $29.5 million at December 31, 1995 and 1994, respectively.

Webster uses forward  commitments to sell residential first mortgage loans which
are entered  into for the purpose of reducing  the market risk  associated  with
originating  loans held for sale.  The types of risk that may arise are from the
possible  inability of Webster or the other party to fulfill the  contracts.  At
December  31,  1995 and 1994,  Webster  had  forward  commitments  to sell loans
totaling $2.9 million and $4.4 million,  respectively, at rates between 5.5% and
8.0% and 8.0% and 9.5%, respectively. The estimated fair value of commitments to
sell loans approximated the commitment price at December 31, 1995 and 1994.

At  December  31,  1995,  1994 and 1993,  Webster  serviced,  for the benefit of
others, mortgage loans aggregating  approximately $753.1 million, $944.5 million
and $357.7 million,  respectively.  During 1995,  Webster sold $290.0 million in
mortgage loan servicing rights and recorded a $2.2 million gain on their sale.

- ----------------------------------------------------------------------------

During the first five years after the First  Constitution  acquisition date, the
FDIC is required to reimburse  Webster  quarterly for 80% of all net charge-offs
(i.e., the excess of charge-offs over recoveries) and certain permitted expenses
related to the Segregated Assets acquired by Webster.

During the sixth and  seventh  years after the First  Constitution  acquisition,
Webster is required to pay  quarterly  to the FDIC an amount equal to 80% of the
recoveries during such years on Segregated Assets which were previously  charged
off after deducting certain permitted expenses related to those assets.  Webster
is entitled to retain 20% of such recoveries  during the sixth and seventh years
following the First Constitution acquisition and 100% thereafter.

Upon  termination  of  the  seven-year  period  after  the  First   Constitution
acquisition,  if the sum of Webster's 20% share of net charge-offs on Segregated
Assets  for the first  five  years  after the  acquisition  date plus  permitted
expenses during the entire  seven-year  period,  less any recoveries  during the
sixth and seventh year on  Segregated  Assets  charged off during the first five
years,  exceeds $49.2 million, the FDIC is required to pay Webster an additional
15% of any such excess over $49.2  million at the end of the seventh year. As of
December  31,  1995,   Webster  had  received  a  total  of  $38.0   million  in
reimbursements  for net  charge-offs  and  permitted  expenses from the FDIC. At
December 31, 1995 and 1994,  Webster had  allowances  for losses of $3.2 million
and $4.4  million,  respectively,  to cover its  portion  of  Segregated  Assets
losses.

A  detail  of  changes  in the  allowance  for  Webster's  share of  losses  for
Segregated Assets follows:

At  December  31,  1995,  Webster was  obligated  under  various  non-cancelable
operating  leases for properties  used as branch office  facilities.  The leases
contain  renewal  options and  escalation  clauses  which  provide for increased
rental  expense based  primarily upon increases in real estate taxes over a base
year.  Rental expense under leases was $827,000,  $950,000 and $702,000 in 1995,
1994 and 1993,  respectively.  Webster is also  entitled to rental  income under
various  non-cancelable  operating  leases for properties  owned.  Rental income
under these leases was  $1,682,000,  $1,474,000  and $638,000 in 1995,  1994 and
1993, respectively.

The  following  is a schedule of future  minimum  rental  payments  and receipts

The reduction in the Core Deposit Intangible balance at December 31, 1995 is the
result of normal monthly amortization only. The core deposit intangible recorded
as a purchase  accounting  adjustment in the First Constitution  acquisition was
reduced by an additional  $5.0 million at December 31, 1994. A write-down of the
core  deposit   intangible   was  deemed   necessary   after  a  review  of  the
recoverability  of this  asset  was  made.  An  evaluation  of the core  deposit
intangible  at December 31, 1995 was  performed  and no further  impairment  was
noted.  Periodic  evaluations of the core deposit 

                                       41

<PAGE>
intangible  asset will continue to be made and any further  impairment,  if any,
will be recorded as a charge to the Consolidated Statement of Income.

The  amount  due from FDIC of $1.2  million  at  December  31,  1995  represents
Webster's 80%  reimbursement  for fourth quarter net charge-offs and expenses on
Segregated  Assets.  The  reduction in the due from FDIC balance at December 31,
1995 reflects a decrease in the volume of segregated  loan  charge-offs  for the
fourth  quarter as compared to the same  quarter for the  previous  year.  Other
Assets are primarily comprised of capitalized mortgage servicing rights, prepaid
expenses and various  miscellaneous  assets.  The  reduction in the Other Assets
balance at  December  31, 1995 is due  primarily  to lower  balances  related to
mortgage servicing rights and prepaid FDIC deposit insurance premiums.

During  the  1995  second  quarter,   Webster  adopted  Statement  of  Financial
Accounting  Standard No. 122 ("SFAS  122")  "Accounting  for Mortgage  Servicing
Rights".  SFAS No. 122 requires that a mortgage  banking  entity  recognize as a
separate  asset the value of the right to  service  mortgage  loans for  others,
regardless  of how those  servicing  rights are acquired.  During 1995,  Webster
capitalized  $181,000 in connection with selling loans while retaining the right
to service  those  loans.  At December  31,  1995,  the  combined  book value of
Purchased  Mortgage  Servicing  Rights  ("PMSR") and Excess  Mortgage  Servicing
Rights  ("EMSR") was $2.6 million.  At December 31, 1995, the fair value of PMSR
and EMSR approximated book value.

Total Federal Home Loan Bank Advances          $ 383,100        $ 370,700
- -----------------------------------------------------------------------------

The weighted average cost of the Federal Home Loan Bank Advances at December 31,
1995 and 1994 was 6.31% and 6.28%, respectively.

At December 31, 1995,  the Bank had additional  borrowing  capacity of over $1.4
billion  from  the  Federal  Home  Loan  Bank,  including  a line of  credit  of
approximately  $40.0 million.  Advances are secured by the Banks'  investment in
FHLB stock and a blanket security agreement. This agreement requires the Bank to
maintain as collateral certain qualifying assets principally  mortgage loans and
securities.  At December 31, 1995 and 1994, the Bank was in compliance  with all
Federal Home Loan Bank requirements.


Note 10
Other Borrowings

Other borrowings  outstanding  consisted of borrowings by the ESOP totaling $3.2
million and $3.7  million at December  31, 1995 and 1994,  respectively,  Senior
Notes (as defined  below)  totaling  $40.0 million at both December 31, 1995 and
1994 and reverse repurchase  agreements  outstanding  totaling $126.9 million at
December 31, 1995. There were no reverse  repurchase  agreements  outstanding at
December 31, 1994. The ESOP  borrowings are from a commercial bank at a floating
rate based on the commercial bank's base (prime) rate and such rates at December
31, 1995 and 1994 were 8.30% and 8.00%,  respectively.  The estimated fair value
of the ESOP borrowing approximates book value at December 31, 1995 and 1994. The
terms  of the  loan  agreements  call  for the  ESOP to  make  annual  scheduled
principal repayments through 2001. Interest is paid quarterly and the borrowings
are secured and  guaranteed  by Webster.  See Note 15 for a  description  of the
increase in the ESOP's outstanding  indebtedness that was incurred in connection
with the Bristol acquisition.

On June 29,  1993,  Webster  completed a  registered  offering of $40 million in
aggregate  principal  of 8 3/4%  Senior  Notes due 2000  ("the  Senior  Notes").
Webster used $18.25  million from the net proceeds of the offering to redeem the
remaining  shares of Series A Stock issued by Webster to the FDIC in  connection
with the First Constitution Acquisition. The Senior Notes may not be redeemed by
Webster prior to maturity and are not  exchangeable  for any shares of Webster's
common stock.

Information   concerning  borrowings  under  reverse  repurchase  agreements  is
summarized below:

The securities  underlying the reverse repurchase agreements are all U.S. Agency
collateral  and have  been  delivered  to the  broker-dealers  who  arrange  the
transactions.  Webster uses reverse repurchase  agreements when the cost of such
borrowings  is  favorable  as compared  to other  funding  sources.  The average
balance and the maximum amount of outstanding  reverse repurchase  agreements at
any month-end  during 1995 was $37.8 million and $126.9  million,  respectively.
The  weighted-average   interest  rate  of  the  reverse  repurchase  agreements
outstanding at December 31, 1995 was 5.80%.


Note 11
Interest Rate Financial Instruments

Webster  utilizes as part of its asset  liability  management  strategy  various
interest rate contracts  including short futures positions,  interest rate swaps
and interest rate caps. (See Note 3 for disclosures on futures positions). These
interest rate financial instruments involve, to varying degrees, credit risk and
market risk.  Credit risk is the possibility  that a loss may occur if a counter
party to a transaction  fails to perform according to the terms of the contract.
Market risk is the effect of a change in interest rates or currency rates on the
value  of the  financial  instrument.  The  notional  amount  of  interest  rate
financial instruments is the amount upon which interest and other payments under
the contract are based.  For interest rate financial  instruments,  the notional
amount is not exchanged and therefore,  the notional amounts should not be taken
as a measure of credit or market risk.

The fair  value,  which  approximates  the cost to replace  the  contract at the
current  market rates is generally  representative  of market risk.  There is no
credit risk related to the  interest  rate swaps at December 31, 1995 due to the
fact that  Webster is  currently  paying  amounts  that are  greater  than it is
receiving.  There is no  credit  risk  related  to the  interest  rates  caps at
December 31, 1995.

The following table represents a summary of interest rate financial  instruments
at December 31, 1995:

Interest  rate swap  agreements  involve  the  exchange  of fixed  and  variable
interest  payments  based upon  notional  amounts  paid to a maturity  date.  At
December  31, 1995,  Webster had two swap  agreements  in which the  corporation
received a variable rate based on LIBOR and paid a fixed rate of 6.66% and 6.04%
on each  swap.  Total  net  interest  expense  paid on 

                                       44

<PAGE>
swap  agreements  totaled  $312,000 for the year ended December 31, 1995.  There
were no swap agreements outstanding at December 31, 1994 and 1993.

Interest rate cap agreements are similar to interest rate swap agreements except
that interest rate payments are made or received only if current  interest rates
rise above a predetermined  interest rate. At December 31, 1995, Webster had two
outstanding  cap agreements with an interest rate cap of 7%. The amount paid for
entering into the interest rate cap is amortized  over the life of the agreement
as an  adjustment  to  mortgage-backed  securities  available  for sale interest
income.  At December 31, 1995,  Webster had $816,000 of unamortized cap balances
and during the 1995 period amortized $250,000.

In December 1991, the Financial  Accounting Standards Board issued Statement No.
107, "Disclosures about Fair Value of Financial Instruments", which requires all
entities to disclose the fair value of  financial  instruments,  including  both
assets  and  liabilities  recognized  and not  recognized  in the  statement  of
financial position, for which it is practicable to estimate fair value.

The carrying amounts for interest-bearing  deposits approximate fair value since
they mature in 90 days or less and do not present unanticipated credit concerns.
The fair value of securities  (Note 3) is estimated based on prices published in
financial  newspapers or quotations  received from securities dealers or pricing
services.  The fair value of interest rate contracts was based on the amount the
Corporation would receive or pay to terminate the agreements.  Federal Home Loan
Bank stock has no active market and is required to be held by member banks.  The
estimated fair value of Federal Home Loan Bank stock equals the carrying amount.

In  estimating  the fair  value of  loans,  portfolios  with  similar  financial
characteristics  were classified by type. Loans were segmented into four generic
types: residential, consumer, home equity and commercial. Residential loans were
further   
                                       45

<PAGE>
segmented into fifteen and thirty year fixed-rate contractual  maturities,  with
the remaining classified as variable-rate loans. The fair value of each category
is calculated by  discounting  scheduled cash flows through  estimated  maturity
using market  discount rates.  Adjustments  were made to reflect credit and rate
risks inherent in the portfolio.

Due to the loss-sharing  arrangement with the FDIC, a yield on Segregated Assets
that approximates a market yield and the allowance for Webster's share of losses
on  Segregated  Assets,  Webster  believes  that  the  estimated  fair  value of
Segregated  Assets  approximates  their  carrying  amount of $104.8  million and
$137.0 million at December 31, 1995 and December 31, 1994, respectively.

The  estimated  fair  value  of  deposits  with  no  stated  maturity,  such  as
noninterest  bearing demand deposits,  regular  savings,  NOW accounts and money
market  accounts,  is equal to the amount payable on demand.  The estimated fair
values of  certificates  of deposit,  Federal Home Loan Bank  Advances,  reverse
repurchase agreements and Senior Notes were calculated using the discounted cash
flow method.  The discount rate is estimated using rates  currently  offered for
deposits and Federal Home Loan Bank  Advances of similar  remaining  maturities.
The discount rate used for the Senior Notes was  calculated  using a spread over
Treasury  Notes  consistent  with the spread  used to price the Senior  Notes at
their inception.  The carrying amount of purchased mortgage servicing rights and
excess mortgage servicing rights  approximates market value at December 31, 1995
and 1994.

The  calculation of fair value  estimates of financial  instruments is dependent
upon certain  subjective  assumptions  and involves  significant  uncertainties,
resulting in  variability in estimates  with changes in  assumptions.  Potential
taxes and other  expenses that would be incurred in an actual sale or settlement
are not  reflected  in the  amounts  disclosed.  Fair  value  estimates  are not
intended to reflect the liquidation value of the financial instruments.

In connection with the Bristol acquisition,  a purchase accounting adjustment of
$5.9 million for the allowance for losses on foreclosed  properties was recorded
at the time of the  acquisition  and added to  Bristol's  existing  allowance of
$600,000 to reflect an accelerated disposition strategy.

Note 14
Income Taxes

As discussed more fully in Note 1, Webster  adopted  Statement 109 as of January
1, 1993. The cumulative  effect of this change in accounting for income taxes of
$4.6 million was determined as of January 1, 1993 and is reported  separately in
the  consolidated  statements  of income.  Prior period  consolidated  financial
statements have not been restated to apply the provisions of Statement 109.

Charges for income taxes in the Consolidated  Statements of Income are comprised
of the following:

</TABLE>

At December 31, 1995 Webster had a net deferred tax asset of $14.8  million.  In
order to fully realize the net deferred tax asset,  Webster must either generate
tax losses to carryback or generate  future taxable  income.  Based on Webster's
historical and current taxable earnings,  management  believes it is more likely
than not that Webster  will realize the net deferred tax asset.  There can be no
assurance,  however,  that  Webster  will in the  future  generate  any  taxable
earnings or any specific level of continuing taxable earnings.

In March 1994, Webster acquired Bristol,  as discussed more fully in Note 2. The
acquisition of Bristol resulted in significant tax benefits, which are reflected
in the  deferred  tax  asset  at  December  31,  1995 and  1994.  On the date of
acquisition Bristol's deferred tax asset of approximately $14 million had a 100%
valuation  allowance,  due to an unfavorable earnings history of Bristol and the
uncertain  nature of generating  future taxable income.  Since the  acquisition,
Bristol generated net income and there was an expectation that it would continue
to operate profitably in the future.

                                       47

<PAGE>


As a result of the  merger of First  Federal  into  Bristol  and the  subsequent
renaming of the Bank to Webster Bank (see Note 1 a.) any tax loss  carryforwards
and all other tax attributes  associated with the Bristol  acquisition have been
retained.  As a result of the Bristol  acquisition,  Webster has Connecticut net
operating  loss  carryovers  approximating  $13 million  which expire in various
years through 1998.  Webster has  recognized a portion of the deferred tax asset
valuation  allowance  in the current  year,  which  offsets  current  income tax
expense.

Webster's  valuation  allowance  is  principally  for  a  portion  of  temporary
differences  that may be subject to review by taxing  authorities.  The  primary
source of recovery of the  deferred  tax assets are federal  taxes paid that are
available for carryback of approximately  $9.0 million in 1995. The net decrease
of $3.0 million in the valuation allowance was due to favorable  reassessment of
expected future earnings and resulted in a reduction of income tax expense.

The tax effects of temporary  differences that give rise to significant portions
of the deferred tax assets and deferred tax liabilities at December 31, 1995 and
1994 are presented below.

Note 15
Shareholders' Equity

In December 1995, Webster completed the sale of 1,249,600 shares of common stock
in an underwritten  public offering raising $32.1 million of additional capital,
net of expenses,  which was invested in the Bank to facilitate its completion of
the  Shawmut  Transaction  and to have  the Bank  remain  well  capitalized  for
regulatory purposes.

On November 1, 1995,  Webster  acquired Shelton (see Note 2). In connection with
the acquisition, Webster issued 1,292,549 shares of its common stock for all the
outstanding  shares of Shelton  common stock.  Under the terms of the agreement,
Shelton  shareholders  received .92 of a share of Webster  common stock in a tax
free exchange for each of their shares of Shelton common shares.


                                       48

<PAGE>


On December 16, 1994,  Webster  acquired  Shoreline  (see Note 2). In connection
with the acquisition,  Webster issued 266,500 shares of its common stock for all
533,000 outstanding shares of Shoreline common stock, based on an exchange ratio
of 1 share of Webster's common stock for 2 shares of Shoreline's common stock.

On March 3, 1994,  Webster  completed the sale of 1,150,000 shares of its common
stock in subscription and  underwritten  public offerings that were conducted in
connection  with the Bristol  acquisition.  Of the 1,150,000  shares sold in the
subscription  and public  offerings,  100,000  shares were  purchased by Webster
Bank's ESOP. The ESOP's  outstanding loan balance was increased by approximately
$2.1 million in connection with the purchase.

On December 30, 1992,  through a registered  offering,  Webster  issued  250,000
shares of Series B 7 1/2% Cumulative  Convertible Preferred Stock (the "Series B
Stock") for $25 million.  Webster used 50% of the net proceeds of $23.5  million
from this  equity  offering to redeem  $11.75  million of its Series A Preferred
Stock (as defined). On June 29, 1993, Webster completed a registered offering of
$40 million aggregate  principal amount of 8 3/4% Senior Notes due 2000. Webster
used  $18.25  million  of the  proceeds  from this note  offering  to redeem the
remaining shares of its Series A Preferred  Stock.  During 1995 and 1994 holders
of the Series B Stock  converted  260 shares and 77,871 shares into 1,492 shares
and 446,979 shares, respectively of Webster's common stock.

In connection with the First Constitution acquisition,  Webster issued 1,200,000
shares of Series A Cumulative Perpetual Preferred Stock (the "Series A Stock) to
the FDIC on  October  6, 1992 at a  purchase  price of  $25.00  per share for an
aggregate investment of $30 million.

Retained earnings at December 31, 1995 included $16.4 million of earnings of the
bank  appropriated  to bad debt  reserves and  deducted  for federal  income tax
purposes,  which  retained  earnings  are  not  available  for  payment  of cash
dividends  or  other  distributions  to  Webster,   including  distributions  on
redemption, dissolution, or liquidation, without payment of taxes by the Bank on
the amount of such earnings  removed from the reserves for such  distribution at
the then current tax rate.

Under applicable capital standards adopted by the Office of Thrift  Supervision,
("OTS")  savings  institutions  are  required  to  satisfy  a  "Tier  1  capital
requirement," a "Tier 1 risk-based capital requirement," and a "total risk-based
capital  requirement."  At December  31,  1995,  Webster  Bank  exceeded all OTS
regulatory  capital  requirements  and met  the  FDIC  requirements  for a "well
capitalized" savings institution.  In order to be considered "well capitalized,"
a depository  institution  must have a ratio of Tier 1 capital to adjusted total
assets of 5%, a ratio of Tier 1 capital  to  risk-weighted  assets of 6%,  and a
ratio of total capital to risk-weighted assets of 10%.

The OTS  issued  new  regulations,  effective  January  1,  1994,  which  add an
interest-rate  risk component to the risk-based capital  requirement.  Under the
new regulation,  an institution is considered to have excess  interest-rate risk
if based upon a 200 basis  point  change in market  interest  rates,  the market
value  of an  institution's  capital  changes  by  more  than  2%.  The  OTS has
indefinitely  delayed  implementation  of the new regulation.  The interest-rate
risk requirements, if implemented, are not expected to have a material effect on
the ability of the Bank to meet its risk-based capital requirement.

At the time of the respective  conversions of the Bank and certain  predecessors
from mutual to stock form, each  institution  established a liquidation  account
for the benefit of eligible  depositors  who continue to maintain  their deposit
accounts after conversion.  In the event of a complete  liquidation of the Bank,
each eligible  depositor will be entitled to receive a liquidation  distribution
from the liquidation account. The Bank may not declare or pay a cash dividend on
or  repurchase  any of its capital  stock if the effect  thereof would cause its
regulatory   capital  to  be  reduced  below   applicable   regulatory   capital
requirements or the amount required for its liquidation accounts.

The OTS capital distribution  regulations  establish three tiers of institutions
for  purposes of  determining  the level of  dividends  that can be paid.  Since
Webster  Bank's  capital  levels   exceeded  all  fully  phased-in  OTS  capital
requirements at December 31, 1995, it is considered a Tier 1 Institution. Tier 1
Institutions  generally  are  able to pay  dividends  up to an  amount  equal to
one-half of their  excess  capital at the  beginning of the year plus all income
for  the  calendar  year.  In  accordance  with  the  OTS  capital  distribution
regulations,  the Bank must  provide a 30 day notice prior to the payment of any
dividends  to  Webster.  As of December  31,  1995,  the Bank had $85.1  million
available  for the  payment  of  dividends  under 

                                       49

<PAGE>

the OTS capital distribution regulations. The Bank has paid dividends to Webster
amounting  to $13.1  million  and$4.6  million for 1995 and 1994,  respectively.
Under the prompt corrective action regulations  adopted by the OTS and the FDIC,
the Bank is precluded  from paying any dividend if such action would cause it to
fail to comply with applicable minimum capital requirements.

The Bank has an ESOP that invests in Webster  common stock as discussed in Notes
10 and 16.  Since  Webster  has  secured  and  guaranteed  the  ESOP  debt,  the
outstanding ESOP loan balance is shown as a reduction of  shareholders'  equity.
Shareholders'  equity is increased by the amount of principal  repayments on the
ESOP loan. Principal  repayments totaled $848,000,  $384,000 and $352,000 during
the years ended December 31, 1995, 1994 and 1993, respectively.

On February 6, 1996, Webster's Board of Directors adopted a stockholders' rights
plan in which preferred stock purchase rights have been granted as a dividend at
the rate of one Right for each  share of common  stock  held of record as of the
close of  business  on February  16,  1996.  The plan is designed to protect all
Webster shareholders against hostile acquirers who may seek to take advantage of
Webster and its shareholders through coercive or unfair tactics aimed at gaining
control of Webster without paying all  shareholders a full and fair price.  Each
right  initially  would  entitle the holder  thereof to purchase  under  certain
circumstances  one 1/1,000th of a share of a new Series C Preferred  Stock at an
exercise  price of $100 per share.  The rights will expire in February 2006. The
rights will be  exercisable  only if a person or group in the future becomes the
beneficial  owner of 15% or more of the common  stock,  or announces a tender or
exchange  offer which would result in its ownership of 15% or more of the common
stock,  or if the Board  declares any person or group to be an "adverse  person"
upon a determination that such person or group has acquired beneficial ownership
of 10% or more and that  such  ownership  is not in the  best  interests  of the
company.



Note 16
Employee Benefit and Stock Option Plans

The Bank maintains a noncontributory pension plan for employees who meet certain
minimum  service  and age  requirements.  Pensions  are based upon  earnings  of
covered  employees during the period of credited  service.  The Bank also has an
employee  investment  plan under  section  401(k) of the Internal  Revenue Code.
Under the  investment  plan the Bank  will  match  $.50 for  every  $1.00 of the
employee's  contribution  up  to  6%  of  the  employee's  annual  compensation.
Operations were charged with $438,000, $388,000 and $169,000 for the years ended
December  31,  1995,  1994 and  1993,  respectively,  for  contributions  to the
investment plan.

The Bank's ESOP, which is noncontributory  by employees,  is designed to invest,
on behalf of  employees  of the Bank who meet  certain  minimum  age and service
requirements,  in Webster common stock.  The Bank may make  contributions to the
ESOP in such amounts as the board of directors may determine on an annual basis.
To the  extent  that the Banks'  contributions  are used to repay the ESOP loan,
Webster common stock is allocated to the accounts of  participants  in the ESOP.
Stock and other amounts allocated to a participant's account become fully vested
after the  participant  has  completed  five  years of  service  under the ESOP.
Operations were charged with $848,000, $384,000 and $352,000 for the years ended
December 31, 1995, 1994 and 1993,  respectively,  for contributions to the ESOP.
The 1995 ESOP charge  includes  $722,516 for principal  payments and $125,484 of
interest payments (net of $140,792 of dividends on unallocated ESOP shares). The
number of new ESOP shares and shares  committed  to be  released  subject to the
provisions of Statement of Position  93-6 were 100,000 and 10,687  respectively.
See  Note  14 for a  description  of the  increase  in  the  ESOP's  outstanding
indebtedness that was incurred in connection with the Bristol acquisition.

The following  table sets forth the funded status of the Bank's pension plan and
amounts  recognized  in  Webster's  Consolidated  Statements  of Condition as of
December 31, 1995 and 1994. On November 1, 1995,  Webster  acquired Shelton in a
transaction accounted for as a pooling of interests.  The following pension plan
disclosures exclude Shelton's noncontributory multi-employer pension plan, which
had pension expense of $50,000, $85,000 and $52,000 for the years ended December
31, 1995, 1994 and 1993.  Information  concerning the actuarial present value of
accumulated  plan benefits,  plan assets or benefits  attributable to individual
organizations  participating  in the Shelton pension plan is not provided by the
plan administrator and, therefore, is not included on the following page.

In December 1991, the Financial  Accounting  Standards Board,  ("FASB"),  issued
Statement No. 106,  "Employers'  Accounting for Post  Retirement  Benefits Other
Than Pension," which requires that employers  accrue the costs and recognize the
liability for benefits to be provided to retired  employees  over the employees'
service  period.  This statement is effective for fiscal years  beginning  after
December 15, 1992. During 1994, Webster accrued $900,000 representing cumulative
postretirement benefits,  $700,000 of which was a purchase accounting adjustment
related to the Bristol acquisition.

The   following   table  sets  forth  the   status  of   Webster's   accumulated
postretirement benefit obligation, which was unfunded:

- ----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Accumulated benefit obligation                     $550             $768

- ----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Postretirement benefit liability                   $554             $827
- ----------------------------------------------------------------------------

The  weighted   average  discount  rate  used  in  determining  the  accumulated
postretirement benefit obligation was 7.25%. The assumed weighted average health
care cost trend rate was 13% for 1995.  Such rates  decrease  gradually to 4.25%
through  the year 2008 and remain  level  thereafter.  An  increase of 1% in the
assumed health care cost trend rate would result in a  recalculated  accumulated
benefit obligation of $49,000.

Webster maintains stock option plans (the "Option Plans") for the benefit of its
directors,  officers and other full-time  employees.  Options  totaling  59,600,
194,780 and 146,750 shares were granted in 1995, 1994 and 1993, respectively, at
the fair market value of Webster  common stock on the various  grant dates.  All
options issued prior to June 30, 1993 have been adjusted  retroactively  to give
effect to a 10% stock dividend to common shareholders of record on June 4, 1993.
No options  were  canceled or expired in 1995,  1994 and 1993.  At December  31,
1995,  options for 596,216 shares of common stock were outstanding at an average
option price of $15.56. Options for 51,850 shares were exercised in 1995.


Note 17
Legal Proceedings

Webster is a party to various legal proceedings normally incident to the kind of
business  conducted.  Management believes that no material liability will result
from such proceedings.

Independent Auditors' Report and Management's Report

The Board of Directors and Shareholders of
Webster Financial Corporation
Waterbury, Connecticut:

We have audited the accompanying consolidated statements of condition of Webster
Financial Corporation and subsidiaries as of December 31, 1995 and 1994, and the
related consolidated  statements of income,  shareholders' equity and cash flows
for each of the years in the three-year  period ended  December 31, 1995.  These
consolidated  financial  statements are the  responsibility of the Corporation's
management.  Our  responsibility is to express an opinion on these  consolidated
financial statements based on our audits.

We  conducted  our  audits  in  accordance  with  generally   accepted  auditing
standards.  Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material
misstatement.  An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting
the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements.  An audit also includes
assessing the  accounting  principles  used and  significant  estimates  made by
management,  as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation.
We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.

In our opinion, the consolidated  financial statements referred to above present
fairly, in all material  respects,  the financial  position of Webster Financial
Corporation  and  subsidiaries as of December 31, 1995 and 1994, and the results
of their operations and their cash flows for each of the years in the three-year
period ended December 31, 1995, in conformity with generally accepted accounting
principles.

As discussed in Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements,  the Corporation
changed  its method of  accounting  for  mortgage  servicing  rights in 1995 and
income taxes in 1993.

January 24, 1996,  except as to Note 2 and the last  paragraph of Note 15, as to
which the date is February 16, 1996

To Our Shareholders:
The  management of Webster is responsible  for the integrity and  objectivity of
the  financial  and  operating  information  contained  in this  annual  report,
including  the  consolidated  financial  statements  covered by the  Independent
Auditors'  Report.  These  statements were prepared in conformity with generally
accepted  accounting  principles and include  amounts that are based on the best
estimates and judgments of management.

Webster has a system of internal  accounting  controls which provides management
with  reasonable  assurance  that  transactions  are  recorded  and  executed in
accordance  with its  authorizations,  that assets are properly  safeguarded and
accounted  for,  and that  financial  records  are  maintained  so as to  permit
preparation  of financial  statements  in  accordance  with  generally  accepted
accounting principles. This system includes

formal  procedures,  an organizational  structure that segregates  duties, and a
comprehensive  program of periodic audits by the internal auditors.  Webster has
also instituted  policies which require  employees to maintain the highest level
of ethical standards.

In addition, the Audit Committee of the Board of Directors, consisting solely of
outside directors, meets periodically with management, the internal auditors and
the independent auditors to review internal accounting  controls,  audit results
and accounting principles and practices, and annually recommends to the Board of
Directors the selection of independent auditors.
