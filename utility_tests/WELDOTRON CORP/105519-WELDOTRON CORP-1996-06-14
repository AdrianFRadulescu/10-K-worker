     A.   Packaging Systems Group

     The  Packaging   Systems  Group   designs,   manufactures   and  markets  a
comprehensive  line of  packaging  machinery  and  systems  for a broad range of
industrial and consumer  applications  as well as food  packaging,  weighing and
labeling  systems for  supermarkets  and fresh food  processors.  These  systems
employ either shrink or stretch packaging techniques.

     (i)  Industrial  Packaging  Systems:  The  Company's  industrial  packaging
machines and systems employ a technique called "shrink" packaging which utilizes
specially  formulated  thermoplastic  films that are  oriented  in the  original
manufacturing  process  to  shrink  with  the  application  of heat.  In  actual
operation,  the product is enveloped in shrink film, the film is sealed, and the
completely  overwrapped  product is passed through a hot air shrink tunnel where
the heated air causes the film to shrink tightly around the product.

     The  Company  was a  pioneer  in  the  shrink  packaging  industry  and  is
considered a leading  developer of shrink  packaging  machinery.  The  Company's
Industrial Packaging Systems group manufactures a broad line of shrink packaging
systems  designed to provide  substantial  user benefits such as lower packaging
costs,  increased  productivity,  and improved product appearance and integrity.
Many standard  models are offered from manual  L-sealers  and shrink  tunnels up
through fully automated  form/fill/seal  wrapping  systems that include feeders,
collators and speed modulated conveyors.

     Industrial  Packaging's line of manually operated shrink packaging machines
is  believed  to be among the highest  quality  machines  of their  type.  These
machines  incorporate  features not generally found in competitive low-end units
such  as   electronic   timing,   microprocessor   controls,   self-compensating
temperature controls and low operating costs and maintenance requirements.

     Industrial  Packaging's  medium speed  equipment  program  includes the new
FastPakTM  series of automatic  L-sealers.  The FastPak series features a unique
"vertical  rising" seal head that maximizes machine operating speed and produces
stronger seals than pivoting type seal bars found on competitive machines. Other
features include single level operation for smooth product transfer,  adjustable
film forming plow for quick  product  changeover,  and heavy duty unibody  steel
construction for longevity.

     The  Company's  high-speed  automatic  equipment  is of the  type  known as
horizontal  form,  fill and seal.  It  functions  by  forming  film into a tube,
feeding the products to be wrapped at spaced  intervals  into the tube, and then
sealing  and  cutting  the tube  between  successive  products.  The result is a
film-wrapped package which is then passed through a high-speed shrink tunnel for
the final stage of shrinking.  The principal applications for these systems have
been the  packaging  of computer  software  and memory  disks,  magnetic  tapes,
cassettes,  books,  hardware,  toys,  gift  items  and the  like  wherein  large
quantities  of items  must be  packaged  and  shipped in  relatively  short time
intervals.

     The Company also offers an economically  priced,  in-line  form-fill shrink
packaging system that targets a medium speed niche market for larger  industrial
products.  The Company has expanded  this product  range to include an edge seal
version to target the tape, cassette, CD and entertainment products industries.

     The Company's high speed automatic  shrink  packaging  systems also provide
what  the  Company  believes  to  be  a  practical,  cost-effective  method  for
tamper-evident packaging for food and non-food products.

     (ii) Stretch Packaging Systems:  The Company introduced the first automatic
four-way stretch packaging  machines in the United States during the 70's. These
systems  use  semi-elastic  plastic  films to wrap food  products  such as meat,
poultry,  seafood and produce.  These  packaging  systems  mechanically  stretch
plastic film tightly around the food product,  which is generally in a tray, and
then lap the  plastic  film over  itself on the  bottom of the tray and seal the
package. The result is a transparent,  skin-tight wrap on the display surface of
the tray.

     Our automatic  stretch  packaging systems function by cutting and feeding a
predetermined  size  sheet of  plastic  film into  position  above an  elevating
mechanism.  The product to be wrapped is transferred  onto the elevator and then
raised into contact with the film while the  periphery of the film is gripped by
controllable  tension clamps.  The film is thus stretched around the product and
the wrap is completed by  mechanically  tucking the film under the product.  The
wrapped  product is then  discharged  over a hot belt which seals the film under
the product.  Variations of these systems based on horizontal  form/fill stretch
wrapping for high speed applications in food processing plants are also offered.
There are  currently  a choice of models of  stretch  packaging  systems  in the
Company's line intended for central packaging operations (warehouse or packaging
plants) while others are intended for operation in supermarkets.

     The Company  recently  introduced the ULTRAMATIC High  Performance  wrapper
specifically  designed for larger high volume super-stores,  a niche market that
the Company  believes  offers growth  potential.  With continued  refinement the
ULTRAMATIC machines are increasingly successful.

     The wrapping operation, particularly in supermarkets, is generally followed
by a weighing and labeling operation.  After an extensive development program in
the early 80's, the Company developed WeighwrapR,  a fully integrated system, by
combining a stretch  packaging system with: (i) a microcomputer  featuring alpha
numeric  keyboard entry and a large memory  capacity,  (ii) an air-blow  labeler
with thermal  printing  capabilities  that has no moving  parts,  no ink, and no
ribbon,  and (iii) an  electronic  solid state load cell scale.  Building on the
success  of  the  ULTRAMATIC  series,  the  Company  recently  introduced  a new
generation of automatic stretch wrappers for supermarkets called ULTRAMATE.  The
ULTRAMATE is the first wrapper capable of integration with  counter-top  scales,
low-end  prepack  scales  and  automatic  weigh-labeling  units  from  different
manufacturers.

     The Weighwrap system performs the following functions:

1.   As the product to be wrapped is placed on the infeed of the wrapper,  it is
     weighed by an electronic solid state load cell scale.

2.   The  weight  information  is  converted  to  digital  form  and  fed  to  a
     microcomputer   which  calculates  the  sale  price  of  the  product  from
     information stored in the computer's memory.

3.   The weight,  sale price,  and other  optional  information,  are  thermally
     printed on a label which is  automatically  applied to the package as it is
     discharged from the wrapper.

     The  Weighwrap  system is  covered  by  patents  granted  in 1985 which run
through 2002. In 1990, the Company settled  litigation  concerning the Weighwrap
patents  against the Hobart  Division of Premark  International.  Following  the
successful completion of the Hobart litigation,  the Company licensed one of the
patents to other  manufacturers and received initial royalty fees covering prior
periods.  The Company expects to receive future royalties on the patents through
2002 based on percentages of sales of licensees'  products.  Seven companies are
now licensed under the Weighwrap Patent.

     In addition,  a system  combining a package  positioning and conveying unit
with an electronic  scale, a microcomputer,  and a labeler has been developed to
be used in conjunction with previously sold stretch wrapping equipment at either
the in-store or central packaging level,  providing the user with the advantages
of a Weighwrap system.

     The Company has been  experiencing  intense  competition in the supermarket
equipment market. (See Item 1 E. Competition).  To offset such competition,  the
Company  concentrated  more of its efforts on fresh food packaging  applications
for food processor and central packaging plants.

     B.   Safety and Automation Systems Group

     The Safety and Automation Systems Group designs, manufactures and markets a
line of solid state industrial  electronic  control systems for personnel safety
and quality control monitoring of automatic production machinery. Certain models
are  manufactured  in  Piscataway,  New Jersey  while  others  are  manufactured
elsewhere  in  accordance  with the  Company's  specifications.  The  electronic
controls  protect  operators  from  injury,  prevent  tool  damage,  and  detect
production   malfunctions.   Areas  of  concentration  within  this  market  are
electronics,  automotive and appliances. Secondary markets consist of packaging,
plastics, special machines, and robotics area guarding.

     Safe-T-Lite  is the trade name of the  Company's  product  line of infrared
presence sensing devices  designed to comply with current  standards for machine
guarding.  The  addition of the 8230 Thin Line Series has allowed the Company to
gain  market  share.  The  Company  now offers what it believes to be one of the
widest variety of sizes and options of presence sensing devices.

     PMD - Programmable  Monitoring  Device - is the Company's latest entry into
the die protection  market.  The unit  incorporates  advances in  microprocessor
technology  and is  designed  to prevent  costly  damage due to  improper  parts
ejection,  die overload,  misfeed,  and other  malfunctions  of automatic  press
operations.  The PMD has 6 Channel capability,  each with the ability to program
one of 5 functions.

     Pro-Set is a resolver based  multi-functional  press automation controller.
It combines the features of 16-channel programmable limitswitch with an advanced
12-station programmable die protection system and a brake monitor which complies
with OSHA 1910.217 (b 14). It features 200 job set-up memory capability.

During this fiscal year the Company completed the transition from purchasing the
majority of the Safety and Automation  Systems division  product  off-shore to a
domestically sourced and manufactured product.

     C.   Discontinued Operations

      Due to management's desire to focus on its core  businesses--packaging and
safety and  automation--it  decided in the first quarter of Fiscal '95 to divest
its  communications  subsidiary,  Valiant  International  Multi-Media  Corp. The
subsidiary  was sold  effective  August 31, 1994 to a group of  investors  which
included the management of the subsidiary and a Company  director  (subsequently
resigned).

     The  product  line  of  the  discontinued   operation  consisted  of  video
equipment,  tape  recorders  and other audio  devices,  computer  equipment  and
accessories,   books  and  other  related  products.   These  products  targeted
professional  markets that included schools,  business and industry,  government
agencies, hospitals, libraries, television and radio stations and colleges. Some
of the products were produced to Company  specifications  and were assembled and
packaged to meet market needs. None were manufactured by the Company.

     D.   Manufacturing

     The Company conducts North American  manufacturing  operations in a leased,
one-story  plant  consisting of 256,000 square feet located on a 15 acre site in
Piscataway, New Jersey.

     Manufacturing  of packaging  systems are  conducted  on a batch  production
basis using progressive  assembly methods. The Company fabricates the parts used
in its finished  products from raw materials and components and produces most of
its  sub-assemblies,  except for certain  parts and  sub-assemblies  supplied by
selected   domestic  and  foreign   suppliers.   These  parts,   components  and
sub-assemblies  are carried in inventory in  anticipation of projected sales and
are then assembled into finished products according to production schedules.  In
general,  manufacturing  of standard  machines is commenced in  anticipation  of
orders rather than to meet existing backlog. The manufacturing processes for the
Company's  products take several months,  depending upon their size,  complexity
and quantity.  However,  it has generally  been the  Company's  experience  that
except for customized  equipment (which is made to order),  most orders received
are for items that are in the process of being manufactured or are in inventory.
The Company also maintains an extensive  spare parts  inventory to meet customer
needs.

     The raw  materials  used  by the  Company  include  steel,  copper,  brass,
aluminum and various plastics.  Some components including motors,  transformers,
fittings,  electrical and electronic  components,  drives,  and general  purpose
hardware,  are purchased by the Company.  Many of the purchased  components  are
built to the  Company's  specifications.  The  Company  believes  that it is not
dependent upon any single supplier for any raw material or component.

     The  Company's  products  are  designed  to operate  efficiently  over long
periods,  and rigorous  inspection  procedures  are performed to insure that its
manufacturing processes result in products meeting these and other requirements.

    The  Company's   products  are  serviced  at  its  customers'   premises  by
distributors, dealers or the Company's technicians.

     The Company  generally  provides its customers with express limited written
warranties  covering its industrial  packaging equipment for a period of 90 days
and its food packaging equipment for a period up to two years.

     The Company also has a manufacturing plant in Nova Odessa, Brazil.

     E.   Marketing and Sales

     The Company  sells its  packaging  equipment in North America to industrial
companies,  food  processors,  and supermarkets  directly and through  packaging
machinery distributors and dealers. For the fiscal year ended February 29, 1996,
approximately  34% of the Company's sales were made directly to the end user and
approximately 66% were made through other  distribution  channels.  Direct sales
are more prevalent in stretch packaging systems than in shrink systems.  Stretch
wrapping  machinery sales to supermarkets,  however,  are generally made through
independent  dealers who  specialize in sales and service in selected  cities or
regions.  The  Company's  largest  customer  is W.R.  Grace and Co.,  which buys
packaging  equipment  from the Company for  resale.  For the fiscal  years ended
February 29, 1996, and February 28, 1995, and 1994  respectively,  sales to W.R.
Grace and Co. accounted for approximately  8%, 6%, and 14% respectively,  of the
consolidated net sales of the Company.

     Regional sales  territories  are managed by the Company's staff of regional
managers, who provide distributors sales training and sales support. The Company
participates  in domestic  and foreign  trade  shows and  maintains  an in-house
marketing  services  staff that  handles  product  publicity,  advertising,  and
promotion. Advertising is generally placed in trade journals.

     The Company's backlog of unshipped customer orders was approximately $2,200
and $1,653 at February 29, 1996 and February 28, 1995, respectively.
     Foreign sales, which aggregated  approximately 9% of net consolidated sales
for the fiscal year ended  February  29, 1996 are  carried out  directly  and by
certain appointed distributors.

     The Company's  Brazilian  subsidiary,  Weldotron do Brasil,  Ltd. (WdB), is
included  in the  consolidated  results of the  Company.  It is 60% owned by the
Company, with the remaining 40% being Brazilian owned. WdB has been a subsidiary
of the Company since 1973. The Company believes that WdB has a substantial share
of the Brazilian shrink packaging  equipment  market;  however  competition from
imported equipment is intense.

     Weldotron do Brasil manufactures  industrial  packaging systems for sale in
Brazil and certain South American export markets.  WdB owns a 21,000 square foot
production  facility in Nova Odessa,  Brazil which it  constructed  and occupied
during fiscal 1990.

     Although the Brazilian  economy showed  increasing  economic  activity this
year,  inflation  continues to disturb the relative price of goods and services,
leaving the economic situation uncertain.

     In October 1994, the local  management of the company  submitted a proposal
to buy the Brazilian operations.  However, the Company rejected the offer due to
unsatisfactory  terms. The Company obtained the services of an investment banker
to  prepare a  valuation  of the  entire  Brazilian  operations  comprising  the
packaging  machinery business and the real estate.  According to this valuation,
the entire value of this business was  approximately  $1,950,  before the fiscal
1996  distribution  of capital.  The Company has instructed  this firm to find a
possible buyer for the Brazilian  operations assuming an appropriate price would
be realized.

     For the past several fiscal years, the Company has experienced fluctuations
in reported  financial results due to Brazilian  currency  translation gains and
losses.  The Company is not capable of determining  future  translation gains or
losses and is uncertain of their effects on reported results in future periods.

     F.   Competition

     The Company  faces intense  competition  in all of its product  lines.  The
Company  competes  primarily on the basis of quality,  service,  technology  and
price.

     The Company's  principal  competitors  in shrink  packaging are Great Lakes
Corporation,  Shanklin  Corporation and a variety of Japanese  producers.  Great
Lakes  Corporation  and  Shanklin  Corporation  are  comparable  in  size to the
Company.  Although definitive statistics are not available, the Company believes
that it has an important  share of the  high-speed  automatic  shrink  packaging
equipment market in the United States.

     The  Company's  principal  competitors  in stretch  packaging  and weighing
systems are the Hobart Division of Premark International, Inc. and Toledo Scale,
which are larger than the Company.  The Company believes that these  competitors
possess far greater resources than the Company.

     The Company holds and has filed  applications for United States and foreign
patents  relating  to  many  of its  products.  The  Company  also  has  certain
registered trademarks.  The Company has licensed some of its technology to other
manufacturers.

     G.   Employees

     At February 29, 1996, the Company had approximately 111 domestic employees,
including  68  engaged in  manufacturing,  6 in  engineering  and  design,  6 in
technical service and support, 21 in sales and marketing,  and 10 in general and
administrative functions. Comparatively, last year the Company had approximately
103  domestic  employees,  which  included  48  engaged in  manufacturing,  8 in
engineering  and design,  8 in technical  service and  support,  24 in sales and
marketing and 15 in general and administrative functions.

     The Company's  manufacturing  employees  predominantly work a single shift.
Approximately  60 of the Company's  manufacturing  employees are  represented by
Local 427 of the  International  Union of Electrical,  Radio and Machine Workers
AFL-CIO.

     A  labor  contract  covering  the  Company's  manufacturing  employees  was
successfully  concluded in March 1994 for the period  March 1994  through  March
1997. The Company generally considers its labor relations to be satisfactory.

     The Company's Brazilian subsidiary employs about 78 people.

Notes:
(1) Personnel reductions and reduced space requirements due to the use of demand
flow  manufacturing  concepts.  The current space requirement is only 90,000 sq.
ft.  Therefore  the Company is actively  seeking to sublease  the excess  square
footage.  It is anticipated  that the sublease  income will exceed the remaining
lease obligations and amortization of the leasehold improvements.

(2)  Property is free of encumbrances.

ITEM 3. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS

     The Company is involved in various  legal  actions  arising in the ordinary
course of business and several claims have been asserted  against the Company as
of February  29,  1996.  Some of the actions  involve  claims for  compensatory,
punitive or other damages.  The Company presently believes that any compensatory
damage claims are adequately covered by insurance.

Martin Siegel vs. Weldotron Corporation

     On November 23, 1994,  the  Registrant  was served with a lawsuit  filed by
Martin  Siegel in the  Superior  Court of New Jersey,  naming the Company as the
defendant.  The other  defendants  named were:  William L. Remley and Richard C.
Hoffman, officers and directors of the Company; Richard Kramer, John D. Mazzuto,
Bryon Fusini and Fred H. Rohn,  directors of the Company;  Lyford Corp., a major
shareholder of the Company and Mentmore  Holdings Corp. Until earlier this year,
Mr.  Siegel served as Chairman of the Board and Chief  Executive  Officer of the
Company.  On or about  November 2, 1994,  the Company  terminated  Mr.  Siegel's
employment agreement for cause. Mr. Siegel alleged, among other things, that the
Company  breached  its  obligations  to him under his  employment  agreement  by
forcing his  resignation as Chairman of the Board and Chief  Executive  Officer,
ceasing  his  regular  salary and  failing to fund a grantor  trust  designed to
secure Mr. Siegel's  deferred  compensation  benefits.  The defendants were also
served with an Order to Show Cause,  seeking to secure an  immediate  funding of
the grantor trust and summary disposition of his claims.

     On January 3, 1995, the court denied Mr. Siegel's request for a preliminary
injunction  mandating  the  immediate  funding of the grantor  trust and for the
matter to proceed  summarily.  Periodic payments of Mr. Siegel's annual deferred
compensation  benefits were  deposited  into an escrow  account  pending a final
determination of this matter.

     On April 13, 1995,  the Company  reached a full and final  settlement  with
Martin  Siegel.  Under the terms of the  settlement,  which was  approved by the
Court: (1) all claims and  counterclaims  by, between and among Mr. Siegel,  the
Company and the other parties to the litigation were dismissed,  with prejudice,
(2) Mr.  Siegel and the Company  exchanged  mutual  releases,  (3) Mr.  Siegel's
Employment  Agreement  with the  Company  dated March 1, 1988,  as amended,  was
terminated,   and  (4)  Mr.  Siegel  was  awarded  a  lifetime  annual  deferred
compensation  benefit of $100. The annual  deferred  compensation  benefit is an
unsecured obligation of the Company.

Product Safety Program

     The Company has a product  safety  program  which has been  implemented  in
response to the  burgeoning  litigation  against  corporations  in America.  The
program includes,  among other things,  taking a proactive and aggressive course
of action to defend  against  alleged  claims for  damages  including  immediate
investigation if an injury is reported.

     No dividends have been paid to date and the Company does not anticipate the
payment  of  future   dividends.   The  Company's  loan  agreements  also  place
restrictions on the amounts of dividends that can be paid.

There were  approximately  561 stockholders of record at February 29, 1996.
The Company  believes  that a significant  number of beneficial  owners of stock
hold their shares in "street" names.

ITEM 7  MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL
CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

The following  discussion and analysis  should be read in  conjunction  with the
accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements, including the Notes thereto, and
the information presented under the caption,  "Selected  Consolidated  Financial
Data".  All  information is based on the Company's  fiscal year-end of February.
All amounts are in thousands except as noted.

FINANCIAL CONDITION AND LIQUIDITY

The primary and secondary  sources of financing for the Company  during the year
were a secured  revolving  line of credit and term loan with Congress  Financial
Corporation (the Credit Facility) and notes from Related Parties,  respectively.
The  Credit  Facility  was  originally  entered  into  on June  25,1991,  with a
revolving  line of credit  and term loan for  working  capital  purposes  not to
exceed $5,000,  which replaced the Company's  existing credit facility.  In June
1996, the credit  facility was amended to decrease the line of credit to $2,500,
extend the maturity date to June 25, 1997, and reset the financial  covenants as
outlined later.  The Credit Facility will remain the Company's  principal source
of operating liquidity.
Available  borrowings are based on certain  percentages of eligible  receivables
and inventory.

At February 29, 1996 the Company had used  approximately  $1,514 of the Congress
Credit Facility (See note 7 to the consolidated financial statements).  Based on
the advance  percentages of eligible  receivable and inventory,  the Company had
unused borrowing availability of approximately $61 at February 29, 1996.

The principal  covenants in the Credit  Facility,  as amended,  require that the
domestic  consolidated  tangible  net worth and  domestic  consolidated  working
capital as amended in the  financing  agreement,  should be at least  $1,050 and
$1,700 respectively.  Additionally,  capital expenditures should not exceed $500
per year. At February 29, 1996 the Company was in compliance with all covenants,
as amended,  in the Credit  Facility,  with domestic  consolidated  tangible net
worth at $2,078 and domestic  consolidated working capital at $2,585 computed as
defined in the financing agreement. Capital expenditures were $231 for the year.

On August 31,  1994,  the  Company  borrowed  $500 from Lyford  Corporation,  an
affiliated  company that owns 19.56% of the issued and outstanding  common stock
of the Company.  The loan bears interest at 12% per annum and was originally due
on February 29, 1996.  Effective  March 1, 1995, this note was rolled into a new
note in the amount of $1,000, in consideration of an additional  advance of $500
received from Lyford.  The new note was  originally due and payable on or before
March 31, 1996. The note was subsequently  extended until April 1, 1997. The new
note as extended  carries  interest at 14% per annum.  In  connection  with this
financing, the Company granted Lyford on August 5, 1994, a Common Stock Purchase
Warrant to purchase up to 200,000  shares of common stock at $2.00 per share and
on May 5, 1995 a warrant to  purchase  up to 1 million  shares of the  Company's
common stock at an exercise  price of $1.00 per share.  The  warrants  expire in
August 2004 and April 2005. The market price of the Company's  stock at the date
of the grants was $2 in August 1994 and $.875 in May 1995.

In January,  1996 the Company  entered into a $500 revolving loan agreement with
Exford Corp.  an  affiliated  company of Lyford.  The  Registrant  borrowed $150
toward this note which  bears  interest at 14% and is due and payable on January
31, 1997. In connection  with this  revolving  loan, the Company has assigned to
Exford its right,  title and interest as tenant under its lease,  together  with
any rents due and payable to the Company.

     The Company's net working  capital and current  ratio  decreased  from last
year. Net working capital  decreased from $5,933 to $3,989 and the current ratio
decreased from 1.90 to 1.67.  The major changes in the net working  capital from
year to year were the following:  Accounts receivable decreased from $2,461 last
year to $2,000 this year due to a 17.1% decline in domestic sales from last year
coupled  with  improved  collection  performance  at our  Brazilian  subsidiary.
Inventories  decreased  from  $9,025  last  year to  $6,653  this year due to an
inventory  valuation allowance of $1,085 required to reduce inventory to the net
realizable value this year coupled with efforts to keep inventory levels in line
with reduced sales.  Prepaid  expenses and other current  assets  increased from
$303 last year to $563 this year  primarily due to a shift in policy periods for
certain  business  insurance  coverages as a result of obtaining  annual premium
savings.  Short  term  borrowings  decreased  from  $2,178 to $981 due to better
working capital management,  which is partially offset by the Exford note issued
in fiscal  1996 which is due on January  31,  1997.  Accounts  payable and other
current  liabilities  increased  from  $4,440  last  year to  $4,967  due to the
extension of terms received from major vendors. These extended payment terms are
expected to continue in 1997.
Capital expenditures  excluding  finance-type leases were $231 for 1996 compared
to $399 last year.

     The Company  expects capital  expenditures to approximate  $117 in 1997 and
intends to use leases to finance such investments  where practical.  At February
29,1996,  the  Company  had minor  commitments  for  capital  expenditures.  The
Company's sixty percent owned Brazilian subsidiary Weldotron do Brazil, was
financially self-sufficient for the year and is expected to be so again in 1997.
Brazil operates in a highly inflationary  economy. As a hedge against inflation,
in prior  years,  Weldotron  do Brazil had  invested  excess  cash in three real
estate apartments as investment property. One apartment was sold in fiscal 1995,
with the proceeds distributed as dividends in a 60% and 40% relationship between
Weldotron U. S. and the minority  interest.  At the end of fiscal 1996, title to
one  of  the  remaining  two  apartments  was  transferred  to  Weldotron,  U.S.
(approximately a 60% interest in the total value of the two) at a carrying value
of $377.  The Company has enlisted the services of a broker for the sale of this
apartment to raise additional cash.

The major  component  affecting the operating  cash flow adversely this year and
last year was the operating losses.  However, these adverse changes were largely
offset by  decreases  in inventory  levels due to non-cash  inventory  valuation
reserves and tighter controls,  accounts  receivable due to improved  collection
performance,  and a net  increase in total  current  liabilities  due to reasons
described earlier.

     The  Company  invested  $231 in  property  plant  and  equipment  this year
compared to $399 last year.  These capital  expenditures  were primarily made to
enhance   productivity  in  the   manufacturing   operations  at  our  Brazilian
subsidiary.

The effect of exchange  rate changes on cash and cash  equivalents  for the year
ended February 29, 1996 and the prior year was $306 and $375 respectively.  This
is attributable to Brazil's highly  inflationary  economy and the "Remeasurement
method" used for foreign  currency  translation to be measured into U.S. dollars
as required by SFAS No. 52.

In view of the  decreasing  market share and losses over the past several years,
the Company downsized its organization considerably during fiscal 1995 and 1996.
These  personnel  reductions  together  with the  domestic  inventory  reduction
program and the use of flexible  manufacturing  concepts  has resulted in excess
floor space (which the Company is actively looking to sublease) at the Company's
Piscataway,  NJ  headquarters.  The Company has currently  brokered for sale its
interest in an apartment which was formerly held for investment  purposes by its
Brazilian  subsidiary,  and for which title was transferred to Weldotron U.S. at
the end of the fiscal year.  With the  infusion of cash from the  aforementioned
items,  an increase in sales coupled with a lower  break-even as a result of the
downsizing and subleasing,  and the renewal in June, 1996 of the Congress Credit
Facility through June, 1997 the Company's cash  requirements for operating needs
and capital expenditures in the next twelve months may be met.

RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

Fiscal Year 1996 Compared To 1995
Net Sales from  continuing  operations  were $18,315 which is a decrease of 6.9%
from $19,670 in 1995. The sales decrease was all domestically related.  Domestic
packaging systems sales declined from $13,097 to $11,050 or 15.6%, whereas sales
in the Control  segment  declined from $3,023 to $2,318 or 23.3%.  The Brazilian
subsidiary  increased its sales from $3,550 in 1995 to $4,947 in 1996, or 39.4%.
Domestically, the Company streamlined its product offering this year eliminating
several low margin,  custom made products which required  extensive  engineering
time, as well as certain imported product lines which became less profitable due
to unfavorable changes in exchange rates. The Control segment suffered from lack
of inventory,  unfavorable  exchange rates and exorbitant  price  increases.  In
response,  it shifted sourcing to domestic production on 50% of its product line
and  discontinued  products  accounting  for 15% of previous  year's sales.  The
control segment is now producing  domestically adequate inventory at competitive
prices to support demand, and is rebuilding its business.

Continued  cautious  capital  spending in the economy and fierce  competition in
certain segments of the market have contributed to the domestic revenue decline.
In response to the latter  situation,  the Company has lowered prices on certain
products,  while restructuring certain manufacturing  operations to minimize any
margin impacts.

The Loss From Continuing  Operations  decreased to $3,134 from $3,418 last year.
The decrease resulted from substantially reduced operating expenses and deferred
compensation this year.

Gross margin  decreased  from 36.8% to 32.2% of sales in 1996 and from $7,234 to
$5,901 in dollars.  $1,085 in inventory  valuation  reserves were charged to the
period  and  despite  certain  savings  achieved  in  material  and labor  costs
domestically,  the Brazilian  subsidiary's material cost increased from 29.8% of
sales to 33.3%.

In terms  of  dollar  contribution,  the  Brazilian  subsidiary's  gross  margin
increased  $664 due to higher  sales on a  relatively  fixed  level of  overhead
expenses, while the Control segment's and the Domestic Packaging segment's gross
margins declined $316 and $1,681 respectively.

The Company's selling,  general, and administrative expenses decreased this year
by $1,406 to $6,658 compared to last year. The  Piscataway,  New Jersey location
had a decrease of $1,710,  while the Brazilian location had an increase of $304.
The decrease in Piscataway was in: a)salaries and wages of $801, b)legal fees of
     $290, c) benefits of $203 and  d)advertising  and trade shows of $183.  The
increase at Brazil was primarily due to selling and distribution expenses.

In the  current  year,  the  Company  recorded a reserve of $1,085 to write down
inventory to net realizable  value. This compares to a total charge of $1,031 in
the prior year  comprised  of $390 in  reserves to write down  inventory  to net
realizable value, and $641 of write offs due to discontinued  product lines. The
inventory write off related to discontinued product lines was part of an overall
reassessment  program  of future  product  plans and  streamlining  of  existing
products that began during calendar 1993 and which continued through fiscal 1995
due to the complexity of the review process.

The  decrease in deferred  compensation  expense this year by $497 is due to the
effect  of a  settlement  last  year of a lawsuit  brought  by a former  officer
resulting from early termination which increased his deferred  compensation from
$80 to $100 per annum and the  recognition of increased  life  expectancy of two
former officers reflected in the valuation.

Other Income and Expenses this year included a foreign currency translation gain
of $345  compared  to $344 last year with  respect  to the  Company's  Brazilian
subsidiary. These translation gains represent inflationary gains for these years
on the net  assets of the  Brazilian  subsidiary.  Brazil  operates  in a highly
inflationary economy. Accordingly, the results from the Brazilian operations may
be significantly affected by such fluctuations.  The general price index for the
current year was 15% compared to 869% for the prior year.  The official  selling
rates of exchange to the U.S.  dollar were $1 equals R$0.9726 this year compared
to $1 equals  R$0.8460  last year (In fiscal 1995,  the  Brazilian  currency was
changed from Cruzeiros to Reals). The current and historical levels of inflation
in Brazil and the changing  exchange  rates cannot be expected to affect  future
periods to the same  extent,  or even in the same  direction as were the current
and prior years affected.  Interest  expense  increased by $121 due to increased
average  borrowings  from a Related  Party and higher  interest  rates.  Royalty
income  this year was $42  compared  to $84 last year.  The  Company  expects to
receive future royalties on patents through 2002.
Commission income generated entirely by our Brazilian  subsidiary increased from
$109 last year to $489 this year.

RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

Fiscal Year 1995 Compared To 1994
Net Sales from  continuing  operations in 1995 were $19,670 which was a decrease
of 8.3%  from  $21,462  in 1994.  The  sales  decrease  was all in the  Domestic
Packaging  Systems  segment which  declined from $16,147 to $13,097 or 19%. This
decline  was  partially  due to two  non-repeat  orders  for a total  of  $1,500
included  in fiscal 94 sales.  But for these  orders,  the year to year  decline
would have been  10.6%.  The Company  believed  that the  decrease in  packaging
equipment  sales is due to a  combination  of cautious  capital  spending in the
economy and increased  competition in certain segments of the market. Sales from
the  discontinued  product lines in 1995 were not  significant and therefore the
decision to  discontinue  these  product  lines will have no material  effect on
sales or  profits.  The  Company  remained  committed  to its  programs of price
competitiveness and production cost efficiency.

     Sales of the  Controls  segment  increased  in 1995 to $3,023  compared  to
$2,724 in 1994,  or 11.0%.  The  Brazilian  subsidiary  increased its sales from
$2,591 in 1994 to $3,550 in 1995, or
37%.

The year-end 1995 backlog was approximately $1,653 compared to $1,691 at the end
of 1994.  Again,  the Company  believes the reduction in backlog  reflects lower
levels of spending for capital  goods,  together with  increased  competition in
certain segments.

The Loss From Continuing Operations increased to $3,418 from $2,223 in 1994. The
increase  resulted from higher expenses,  explained  below,  partially offset by
increased gross margins. In spite of the sales reduction, gross margin increased
$969 from 29.2% of sales to 36.8% of sales in 1995.  This was  primarily  due to
our Brazilian packaging segment which had a favorable effect on the gross margin
of   approximately   $546.  The  Control  segment  had  a  favorable  effect  of
approximately  $62,  while the  domestic  packaging  segment had an  unfavorable
effect of $29 largely due to write off of excess inventory of $190 and inventory
valuation  reserves  of $290  both  charged  to cost of sales  (in  addition  to
inventory reduction due to discontinued product lines of $641, stated separately
in the statement of operations).

     The  Company's  selling,  general and  administrative  expenses  (including
related party charges and management  fees)  increased in 1995 by $877 to $8,278
compared to 1994. The  Piscataway,  New Jersey location had an increase of $647,
and the Brazilian  location had an increase of $230.  The increase in Piscataway
was in:  a) legal  fees of  $303,  b)  management  fees of  $214,  c) sales  and
marketing salaries of $236 and d) advertising of $64. The increase at Brazil was
primarily due to sales expenses.
In  fiscal  1995,  the  Company   recorded  a  charge  of  $1,031  (included  in
restructuring  and other  inventory  charges)  related to inventory write off of
discontinued  product lines. This compares to a charge of $625 in the prior year
consisting  of inventory  write off and  severance  pay related to  discontinued
product  lines.  This  inventory  write off is part of an  overall  reassessment
program of future product plans and streamlining of existing products that began
during  calendar  1993 and which had  continued  through  fiscal 1995 due to the
complexity of the review process.

The  increase  in deferred  compensation  expense in 1995 of $571 was due to the
effect of a settlement of a lawsuit brought by one officer  resulting from early
termination  which  increased  his  deferred  compensation  from $80 to $100 per
annum,  the  recognition  of increased  life  expectancy of the former  officers
reflected in the valuation, offset by an increase in the discount rate.

Other Income and Expenses in 1995 included a foreign  currency  translation gain
of $344  compared  to  $405 in 1994  with  respect  to the  Company's  Brazilian
subsidiary. These translation gains represent inflationary gains for these years
on the net  assets of the  Brazilian  subsidiary.  Brazil  operates  in a highly
inflationary economy. Accordingly, the results from the Brazilian operations may
be significantly affected by such fluctuations. The general price index for 1995
was 869% compared to 2,567% for 1994. The official  selling rates of exchange to
the U. S. Dollars were $1 equals  R$0.8460  this year  compared to CR.  $326.105
last  year.  The  historical  levels of  inflation  in Brazil  and the  changing
exchange  rates cannot be expected to affect future  periods to the same extent,
or even in the same direction as were fiscal 1995 and previous  years  affected.
Interest expense increased by $46 due primarily to increased average borrowings.
Royalty income in 1995 was $84 compared to $104 in 1994. The Company  expects to
receive  future  royalties on patents  through 2002.  Other expense was $46 this
year compared to other income of $38 last year.  The decline in other income was
primarily due to our Brazilian subsidiary's loss on the sale of property of $75.

ITEM 8. FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND SUPPLEMENTARY DATA

Consolidated Financial Statements and
Supplemental Schedule for the
Years Ended February, 1996 and 1995
and Independent Auditors Report

INDEPENDENT AUDITORS' REPORT

Board of Directors and Stockholders of Weldotron Corporation
Piscataway, New Jersey

We have audited the accompanying  balance sheets of Weldotron  Corporation as of
February  29,  1996  and  February  28,  1995,  and the  related  statements  of
operations,  stockholders'  equity,  and cash flows for each of the three fiscal
years in the period ended February 29, 1996. These financial  statements are the
responsibility of the Company's management.  Our responsibility is to express an
opinion on these financial statements based on our audits.

We  conducted  our  audits  in  accordance  with  generally   accepted  auditing
standards.  Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material
misstatement.  An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting
the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements.  An audit also includes
assessing the  accounting  principles  used and  significant  estimates  made by
management,  as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation.
We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.

In our opinion,  such  financial  statements  present  fairly,  in all materials
respects,  the  financial  position  of the  Company at  February  29,  1996 and
February 28, 1995, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each
of the three fiscal years in the period  ended  February 29, 1996 in  conformity
with generally accepted accounting principles.

The accompanying  financial statements for the year ended February 29, 1996 have
been prepared  assuming that the Company will  continue as a going  concern.  As
discussed in Note 2 to the financial statements,  the Company's recurring losses
from  operations  and  accumulated  deficit  raise  substantial  doubt about its
ability to continue as a going  concern.  Management's  plans  concerning  these
matters are also  described in Note 2. The  financial  statements do not include
any adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty.

See Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
(Dollar amounts in thousands.)

1. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES
Principles  of  Consolidation  - The  consolidated  financial  statements of the
Company and its subsidiaries include the accounts of all subsidiaries. Financial
information  relating to the Company's 60% owned  subsidiary in Brazil  reflects
the 12 month  periods  ended  December  31,  1995,  1994 and 1993.  All material
intercompany transactions and balances have been eliminated.

The Company designs,  manufactures and markets a comprehensive line of packaging
machinery and systems for a broad range of industrial and consumer  applications
as well as innovative food packaging and weighing  systems for  supermarkets and
fresh food processors.  Its Safety & Automation  Systems Group  manufactures and
markets electronic systems for personnel safety and controls for monitoring high
speed automatic production machinery.

     Sales are primarily  made  throughout  North  America,  with only 9% of the
parent  Company's  sales taking place  internationally.  The Company's 60% owned
Brazilian  subsidiary  sells  throughout  Brazil and certain South American
export markets.

Revenue Recognition - Sales and earnings are recognized  primarily upon shipment
of products or when title passes.

Inventories -  Substantially  all  inventories  are valued at the lower of cost,
determined by the use of the first-in, first-out method (FIFO) or market.

A  standard  cost  system is used to value the  inventory  whereby  overhead  is
allocated  to  work-in-process  and  finished  goods  based upon a direct  labor
component.  Portions of product cost  variances  are  allocated to the inventory
value under the FIFO method.

     Accounts  Receivable  - Accounts  receivable  are net of an  allowance  for
doubtful  accounts.  The  provision  for  doubtful  accounts and  write-off  for
uncollectible  accounts  were $(46),  $72, $73 and $21,  $68, $16 for the fiscal
years ended February 1996, 1995, and 1994, respectively.

Property,  Plant and  Equipment  - The Company  provides  for  depreciation  and
amortization  for  financial   statement   purposes  on  the   straight-line  or
accelerated method over the estimated useful lives of the various depreciable or
amortizable  assets.  The Company's  Brazilian  operations  transferred title in
fiscal 1996 to  Weldotron  U.S. of a 60%  interest in certain  residential  real
estate which consists of apartments held for investment  purposes.  The title to
the  remaining  40%  interest  was  transferred  to the  holder of the  minority
interest.  At  year  end,  the  Company  identified  excess,  fully  depreciated
machinery and equipment which has been put up for sale at $200.

Income  Taxes  -  Weldotron   Corporation  and  its  U.S.  subsidiaries  file  a
consolidated federal income tax return.  Accumulated  undistributed  earnings of
the Company's foreign  subsidiary were  approximately $652 at February 29, 1996.
The Company has not  recognized a deferred tax liability  for the  undistributed
earnings of the subsidiary as it is their intention to permanently reinvest such
earnings. Determination of the liability is not practicable.  Effective March 1,
1993, the company adopted Statement of Financial  Accounting  Standards SFAS No.
109,  "Accounting  for  Income  Taxes,"  which had an  immaterial  effect on the
Company's financial statements.

Cash and Cash Equivalents - Cash and cash  equivalents  include cash on hand and
on deposit in banks and certificates of deposit with an original maturity period
not in excess of three months.  Cash and cash  equivalents of $184 and $261 were
designated  for payments  under various bank  agreements as of February 29, 1996
and February 28, 1995, respectively.

Deferred  Costs - Costs  incurred to secure  financing are  capitalized  and are
amortized on a straight-line method over the life of the related borrowings.

Costs incurred in connection with royalty license  agreements are amortized over
the life of the associated patent or the duration of the agreement, whichever is
shorter.

Foreign  Currency  Translation - The U.S. dollar is the functional  currency for
the Brazilian foreign subsidiary operating in a highly inflationary economy, for
which both  translation  adjustments  and gains and  losses on foreign  currency
transactions are included in earnings.

Net Loss Per  Common  Share - Net loss per  common  share  for each of the years
ended  February  29,  1996,  and  February  28,  1995 and 1994 were  computed by
dividing  net loss by the  weighted  average  number  of shares  outstanding  of
2,300,173,  2,300,173  and  2,116,006  respectively.  Assumed  exercise of stock
options,  warrants  and stock  rights has not been  included in the earnings per
common share calculation as the effect is anti-dilutive.

Use of estimates - The  preparation of financial  statements in conformity  with
generally accepted  accounting  principles requires management to make estimates
and assumptions  that affect the reported  amounts of assets and liabilities and
disclosure of  contingent  assets and  liabilities  at the date of the financial
statements  and the  reported  amounts  of  revenues  and  expenses  during  the
reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates.

Fair Value of Financial  Instruments - The Company's  financial  instruments are
comprised  of cash,  accounts  receivable,  accounts  payable and long term debt
which are carried in the balance sheet at amounts which approximate fair value.

2. MANAGEMENT PLANS AND INTENTIONS

The Company's  financial  statements  for the year ended  February 29, 1996 have
been prepared on a going concern basis which  contemplates  the  realization  of
assets and the settlement of liabilities and commitments in the normal course of
business. The Company incurred net losses in recent years and as of February 29,
1996 had an accumulated deficit of $7,351. In addition, there is limited working
capital  available  under  the  debt  agreements  that  expire  in  June,  1997.
Management  actions were  implemented  at the end of fiscal 1995 and  throughout
fiscal 1996 to begin to restore the Company to financial strength and stability.
Among these  actions  were the  divestiture  of non-core  business,  substantial
reductions of operating expenses, the reestablishment of a major distributorship
and the outsourcing of certain manufacturing operations at more favorable costs.
Further, management believes that it will be able to sublease a large portion of
the  manufacturing  facility  within the year.  Although the  Company's  plan to
sublease has to date proven  unsuccessful,  the  aforementioned  actions coupled
with an expected  slight  increase in sales,  leads  management  to believe that
operations  will  improve.  However,  no assurance can be given that the Company
will be successful in achieving  these cost savings and increased  sales levels,
as well as the  Company's  ability to maintain or  increase  existing  financing
arrangements.  Further, there can be no assurance, assuming the Company achieves
the cost savings,  additional  sales,  and working capital that the Company will
achieve profitability or positive cash flow.

    RESTRUCTURING AND OTHER INVENTORY CHARGES

In fiscal 1994 the Company  recorded a restructuring  charge of $625 as a result
of a  strategic  decision  taken  by the  Company's  Board of  Directors,  which
consisted  of  $150  of  severance  payments  for a  terminated  employee  and a
write-off  of $475 of  inventories  related to certain  products and parts which
were discontinued. In fiscal 1995 the Company discontinued several other product
lines which were either aging or not a part of the core  packaging or industrial
safety  and  automation  business  which  resulted  in a  write-off  of  $641 of
inventories.  In addition  during  fiscal  1996 and 1995 the Company  recorded a
reserve  for  $1,085 and $390,  respectively,  to write  down  inventory  to net
realizable value.

      DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS

In August 1994, the Company  adopted a plan to discontinue the operations of its
100%   owned   subsidiary,   Valiant   International   Multi-media   Corporation
("Valiant"),  and  reported the  subsidiary  as a  discontinued  operation as of
August 31, 1994.

The  consolidated  statements of  operations  and cash flows of the Company have
been   reclassified  to  present  the  operating  results  of  the  discontinued
operation.  Summarized  operating results for the discontinued Valiant operation
were as follows ($000's omitted):

</TABLE>

There was no income  tax  expense  or  benefit  related  to income  (loss)  from
operations.

     The sale of  Valiant's  Assets was  consummated  as of August 31, 1994 to a
group which included the subsidiary's  management and a former  director/officer
of the Company.

     The sale resulted in a loss on disposal of $82 or $.04 per share. This loss
consists of costs in connection  with the sale.  There was no current income tax
expense or benefit related to the loss on disposal.

5. ROYALTY AGREEMENTS
     In  1992,  the  Company  licensed  one  of its  patents  to  several  other
manufacturers.  The  Company  received  royalty  revenue  related  to  licensing
agreements  of $42, $84 and $104 for fiscal  years ended  February 29, 1996
and February 28, 1995 and 1994 respectively.

In June 1991, the Company entered into a credit facility (the "Credit Facility")
with Congress Financial Corporation, ("Congress") to provide a revolving line of
credit and term loan for working  capital  purposes.  The interest rate is 3.75%
over the CoreStates  floating base rate which was 8.5% at February 29, 1996. The
weighted  average  interest rate for the fiscal year ended February 29, 1996 was
9.7%.  The Credit  Facility  further  requires  that the Company pay fees on the
unused line of credit,  for  administration  and upon early  termination  of the
Credit  Facility.  The  Credit  Facility  was  amended  on June  10,  1996;  see
Subsequent Events footnote #17 for further discussion.

The Credit Facility is  collateralized by substantially all of the assets of the
Company and its domestic subsidiaries.  Borrowings under the Credit Facility are
limited to certain  percentages  of eligible  inventory and accounts  receivable
including stipulations as to the ratio of advances collateralized by receivables
compared to advances collateralized by inventory.

The Company was in default of its minimum working capital requirements,  as well
as its minimum  tangible net worth  requirements  as of February  29, 1996.  The
Company obtained  waivers of default and renegotiated new covenant  requirements
with its  lender,  effective  as of February  29,  1996,  as  follows:  domestic
consolidated   tangible   net  worth  of  not  less  than  $1,050  and  domestic
consolidated  minimum working capital of not less than $1,700 (excluding amounts
due under the Credit Facility).  In addition,  the Credit Facility prohibits the
declaration  and payment of dividends,  limits the amount of the advances to and
guarantees  for the  Company's  foreign  subsidiary  and limits  annual  capital
expenditures to $500.

Borrowings under the Credit Facility  aggregated  $1,514,  including a $750 term
loan at February 29, 1996. Total additional borrowing available under the credit
facility amount to  approximately  $61 at February 29, 1996, which is the unused
lines of credit pursuant to the collateral-based formula.

On August 31, 1994, the Registrant borrowed $500 Dollars from Lyford Corporation
("Lyford"), an affiliated company that owns 19.56% of the issued and outstanding
common stock of the  Company.  The Company  executed  and  delivered to Lyford a
promissory  note,  a security  agreement  and a Common  Stock  Purchase  Warrant
granting to Lyford the right to purchase up to 200,000  shares of the  Company's
common stock at an initial  exercise price of two dollars per share, the closing
price for the  Company's  common stock on the date the warrant was granted.  The
warrant expires on August 4, 2004.

On March 1, 1995, the  Registrant  concluded the rolling of this note into a new
note in the amount of  $1,000.  The new  obligation  is  evidenced  by a certain
Amended,  Extended and Restated  Promissory  Note dated as of March 1, 1995 (the
"Restated  Note").  In consideration  for the new loan, the Company executed and
delivered to Lyford the Restated  Note and an additional  Common Stock  Purchase
Warrant. The new note was originally due and payable on or before March 31, 1996
and bears interest at 12% per annum.  The note was  subsequently  extended until
April 1, 1997 and the interest  rate was  increased to 14%.  (See also note #17)
The new loan is secured by a junior lien on all of the Company's assets. The new
warrant  grants to Lyford the right to  purchase up to  1,000,000  shares of the
Company's  common stock at an initial  exercise  price of One ($1.00) Dollar per
share.  The market price of the Company's  common stock was $.875 on the date of
the warrant grant.  The new warrant  expires by its terms on April 12, 2005. The
Company's management considers the note to be at fair value and has not assigned
any value to the warrants.  The loan  transaction  closed  pursuant to documents
dated as of March 1, 1995 and, in the case of the new  Warrant,  April 13, 1995.
These loan documents were  contingent on the Company's  obtaining the consent of
its senior lender, which consent was obtained on May 5, 1995.

In January,  1996 the  Registrant  entered into a $500  revolving loan agreement
with Exford Corp.  ("Exford"),  an affiliated  company of Lyford. The Registrant
borrowed $150 under this agreement  which  borrowings  bear interest at 14%, and
are due on January 31, 1997. In connection with this revolving loan, the Company
has  assigned to Exford its right,  title and  interest as tenant under the main
operating lease, together with any rents due and payable to the Company.

Debt is carried in the balance sheet at amounts which approximate fair value.

8. COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES

Legal  Proceedings  3/4 The  Company is involved  in certain  legal  actions and
claims arising in the ordinary course of business.  Management believes that the
ultimate  outcome of such litigation and claims will not have a material adverse
impact on the Company's financial position.

Self  Insurance - The Company is party to personal  injury and  property  damage
litigation  arising out of  incidents  involving  the use of its  products.  The
Company  obtains  insurance  for  product and general  liability.  However,  the
Company has elected to retain a significant  portion of expected  losses through
the use of  deductibles.  Provisions  for  losses  are  recorded  based upon the
Company's estimates of the aggregate liability for claims incurred. Estimates of
such accrued  liabilities are based on an evaluation of the merits of individual
claims and historical claims experience;  thus, the Company's ultimate liability
may exceed or be less than the amount  accrued.  Amounts  accrued  are paid over
varying periods, which generally do not exceed five years. The methods of making
such estimates and  establishing  the resulting  accrued  liability are reviewed
continually,  and any adjustments  resulting  therefrom are reflected in current
earnings.

Leases - The  Company  rents  office and  manufacturing  facilities  under lease
arrangements  classified  as  operating  leases which  expire  during 2005.  The
Company is  responsible  for the payment of real estate  taxes,  water and sewer
rates and  charges  and  janitorial  and general  maintenance  charges  upon the
facilities.

Rent  expense  for  continuing   operations,   net  of  sublease   income,   was
approximately  $266,  $188 and $194 for the years ended  February 29, 1996,  and
February 28, 1995 and 1994, respectively. Sublease income was $30, $147 and $136
for the years  ended  February  29,  1996,  and  February  28,  1995,  and 1994,
respectively.

Aggregate net minimum lease payments for the remainder of leases are as follows:

Fiscal Year Ended   Operating
   February         Leases
    1997            $  303
    1998               293
    1999               291
    2000               291
    2001               291
 Thereafter          1,237

Employment  Agreements - The Company has no employment  or severance  agreements
with  officers  which  provide  severance  pay if certain  changes in control or
employment status take place.

      STOCK OPTIONS AND WARRANTS

The Company has an Incentive and  Non-Qualified  Stock Option Plan which permits
the granting of options to purchase  100,000  shares of common stock.  Under the
plan,  the option price,  as to the incentive  options,  cannot be less than the
fair market value of the stock as of the date of grant and at least 110% of fair
market value for certain  management  employees.  The purchase  price under each
non-qualified  stock  option  is  determined  by a  Committee  of the  Board  of
Directors.  Options were granted until May 1993 and are  exercisable  within ten
years of the date of grant.

The Company  has a  Directors'  Stock  Option Plan  permitting  the  granting of
options to purchase  100,000 shares of common stock.  Under the plan, the option
price  cannot be less than the fair market  value of the stock as of the date of
the granting of the option.  Options,  which were granted  January 13, 1988, are
exercisable for ten years effective from the date of grant.

In June 1988,  the  stockholders  approved the 1988 Stock Option Plan.  The Plan

In connection with financing  provided by Lyford  Corporation  (see note 7), the
Company  granted  Lyford on August 5, 1994, a Common Stock  Purchase  Warrant to
purchase up to 200,000  shares of common  stock at $2.00 per share and on May 5,
1995 a warrant to purchase up to 1 million shares of the Company's  common stock
at an exercise price of $1.00 per share.  The warrants expire in August 2004 and
April 2005.  The market price of the  Company's  stock at the date of the grants
was $2 in August 1994 and $.875 in May 1995.

      EMPLOYEE BENEFIT PLANS

The Company sponsors a 401(k) savings plan. The Company contributes at a minimum
75% of each participating  employee's annual  contribution  limited to 4% of the
employee's   annual   compensation.   Additionally,   the   Company's   matching
contribution  increases  on  a  sliding  scale  based  on  pretax  profits  as a
percentage of net worth.  The  additional  contribution  is based on the audited
results of the Company's fiscal year immediately  preceding the beginning of the
plan year.  Savings  Plan  expense was  approximately  $63,  $87 and $80 for the
fiscal years ended February 1996, 1995 and 1994, respectively.

The Company participates in a multi-employer pension plan which provides defined
benefits to substantially all union employees.  Amounts charged to pension costs
and  contributed  to the Plan were $62,  $94 and $123 for the fiscal years ended
February 1996, 1995, and 1994, respectively.

      DEFERRED COMPENSATION

The Company has deferred compensation  agreements with two former officers which
provides for an aggregate of $150 to be paid annually for the remainder of their
lives. The Company  recorded the present value of the future estimated  payments
over the remaining lives of these former employees based upon actuarial  tables.
Deferred  compensation expense under these agreements was $124, $621 and $50 for
the fiscal years ended  February,  1996, 1995 and 1994,  respectively.  Payments
made  during  the  fiscal  years  ended  February,  1996,  1995  and  1994  were
approximately $160, $66 and $54, respectively.

The increase in deferred  compensation expense in 1995 is due to the effect of a
settlement of a lawsuit brought by one officer resulting from early termination,
which  increased  his  deferred  compensation  from $80 to $100 per  annum,  the
recognition of increased life expectancy of the former officers reflected in the
current valuation, offset by an increase in the discount rate.

    RELATED PARTIES

The  Company  entered  into an initial  one year  management  advisory  services
agreement in June 1994 with Mentmore Holdings, an affiliate of Lyford and Exford
Corporations,  two  related  companies.  (See  also Note #7) The  agreement  was
automatically  extended  for  successive  one-year  periods  thereafter,  and is
subject to termination upon written notice by either party not less than 90 days
prior to the  expiration of any extended  term.  The  agreement  provides for an
annual  fee of $300.  All  unpaid  monthly  installments  of the fee shall  bear
interest at the lesser of the rate of 12% per annum, or the maximum rate allowed
by law  until  such time as such  installments  are  paid.  Management  fees and
expenses  were $300 and $214 for the years ended  February 29, 1996 and February
28, 1995, respectively, under the agreement. (See also Note #7)

    INDUSTRY SEGMENTS

The Company operates primarily in two business  segments:  Packaging Systems and
Controls.  The Packaging  Systems segment  designs,  manufactures  and markets a
variety  of  industrial  and  food  packaging  systems.   The  Controls  segment
manufactures electronic controls systems.

     Sales to one  distributor,  primarily from the Packaging  Systems  segment,
were  approximately  $1,417,  $1,214, and $2,952 or 8%, 6%, and 14% of net sales
for the fiscal years ended February, 1996, 1995 and 1994 respectively.

15. SHAREHOLDERS' RIGHTS PLAN

On February 25, 1988,  the Board of Directors  declared a dividend of one common
share  purchase  right ( the "Rights") on each  outstanding  common share of the
Company  ( the  "Common  Stock").  The  Rights  attach to the  Common  Stock and
entitles  the holder to buy one share of Common  Stock at an  exercise  price of
$30.00 per share until March 30,  1998,  unless they are redeemed  earlier.  The
exercise price and the number of shares  issuable upon exercise of the Rights is
subject to adjustment to prevent dilution. The Rights have no voting or dividend
rights and  2,500,000  shares of Common Stock are  reserved  for  issuance  upon
exercise of the Rights.

     The Rights can be redeemed by the Company's Board of Directors for $.05 per
Right at any time until ten days  after 20% of the  Company's  Common  Stock has
been acquired or the Rights expire.

The Rights only become exercisable, or transferable apart from the common stock,
ten business  days after a person or group ( the  "Acquiring  Person")  acquires
beneficial  ownership  of 20% or more  of the  Common  Stock;  or  commences  or
announces  an offer for 30% or more of the Common  Stock.  Thereafter,  upon the
occurrence  of certain  events,  (for  example,  if the  Company is a party to a
merger or other business  combination  transaction or the Company is a surviving
entity in a reverse  merger) each Right not owned by the Acquiring  Person would
become  exercisable for the number of shares of the Acquiring  Person (or of the
Company  in the case of a reverse  merger)  which,  at that  time,  would have a
market value of twice the exercise price of the Right.

16. CONCENTRATION OF CREDIT RISK
Financial instruments which potentially subject the Company to concentrations of
credit risk, as defined by Statement of Financial  Accounting Standards No. 105,
consist of certain trade receivables.

The Company's  customer base includes a customer which  represents a significant
portion of the Company's sales and accounts receivables. Although the Company is
directly  affected by the well-being of this  significant  customer,  management
does not believe significant credit risks exist at February 29, 1996.

17. SUBSEQUENT EVENTS

On June 10, 1996, the Company amended its credit facility decreasing its maximum
line of credit and term loan to $2,500,  extending the maturity date to June 25,
1997, and resetting its financial covenants as follows: minimum domestic working
capital of $1,700 and minimum domestic tangible net worth of $1,050. As a result
of this extension,  Weldotron has reclassified the term portion of their debt as

ITEM 13. CERTAIN RELATIONSHIPS AND RELATED TRANSACTIONS

On August 31, 1994,  the  Registrant  concluded a loan  transaction  in which it
borrowed  $500  from  Lyford  Corp.   ("Lyford").   Immediately   prior  to  the
consummation  of  said  transaction,  Lyford  owned  19.56%  of the  issued  and
outstanding  common stock of the Company.  In  consideration  for the loan,  the
Company executed and delivered to Lyford a promissory note, a security agreement
and a Common Stock Purchase Warrant.  The security agreement granted to Lyford a
junior lien on the Company's assets.  The warrant granted to Lyford the right to
purchase  200,000 shares of the Company's common stock at a price of Two ($2.00)
Dollars per share.  The market price of the Company's common stock was $2 on the
date of the warrant grant.  The warrant  expires by its terms on August 4, 2004.
The loan  transaction  closed  pursuant to documents  dated as of August 5,1994.
These loan documents were  contingent on the Company's  obtaining the consent of
its senior lender, which consent was obtained on August 31, 1994.

On May 5, 1995,  the  Registrant  concluded  the rolling of this note into a new
note in the amount of  $1,000.  The new  obligation  is  evidenced  by a certain
Amended,  Extended and Restated  Promissory  Note dated as of March 1, 1995 (the
"Restated  Note").  In consideration  for the new loan, the Company executed and
delivered to Lyford the Restated  Note and an additional  Common Stock  Purchase
Warrant. The new note was originally due and payable on or before March 31, 1996
and bears interest at 12% per annum.  The note was  subsequently  extended until
April 1, 1997 and the interest  rate was  increased to 14%.  (See also Note 17).
The new loan is secured by a junior lien on all of the Company's assets. The new
warrant  grants to Lyford the right to  purchase up to  1,000,000  shares of the
Company's  common stock at an initial  exercise  price of One ($1.00) Dollar per
share.  The market price of the Company's  common stock was $.875 on the date of
the warrant grant.  The new warrant  expires by its terms on April 12, 2005. The
Company's management considers the note to be at fair value and has not assigned
any value to the warrants.  The loan  transaction  closed  pursuant to documents
dated as of March 1, 1995 and, in the case of the new  Warrant,  April 13, 1995.
These loan documents were  contingent on the Company's  obtaining the consent of
its senior lender, which consent was obtained on May 5, 1995.

     In  January,  1996  the  Registrant  entered  into  a $500  revolving  loan
agreement with Exford Corp.  ("Exford"),  an affiliated  company of Lyford.  The
Registrant  borrowed $150 toward this note which bears interest at 14%, and
is due and payable on January 31, 1997.

         FOR VALUE  RECEIVED,  the  undersigned,  WELDOTRON  CORPORATION,  a New
Jersey corporation with offices at 1532 South Washington Avenue, Piscataway, New
Jersey 08855  ("Maker"),  hereby promises to pay to the order of EXFORD CORP., a
Delaware  corporation  ("Payee"),  at such place or places as the holder of this
Promissory Note (this "Note") may from time to time designate in writing, and in
the  absence of such  designation,  then at the office of Payee  located at 1430
Broadway,  13th Floor,  New York,  New York  10018,  the  principal  sum of FIVE
HUNDRED  THOUSAND DOLLARS  ($500,000.00),  or so much thereof as may be advanced
and/or readvanced hereunder and remain unpaid, together with accrued interest at
the rate hereinafter set forth, on the unpaid principal balance hereof from time
to time outstanding  (the "Principal  Balance"),  at the rate applicable  before
maturity,  as set forth in this Note. By Maker's  execution and delivery  hereof
and  Payee's  acceptance  hereof,  such  parties  hereby  acknowledge  that  the
Principal Balance is One Hundred Fifty Thousand Dollars  ($150,000.00) as of the
date hereof.

         1. Revolving Loan.  This Note evidences a revolving loan.  Advances and
readvances shall be made hereunder as provided in that certain Loan and Security
Agreement of even date herewith between Maker and Payee (the "Loan Agreement") .
The entire unpaid principal  balance,  together with accrued and unpaid interest
thereon, and all other obligations of maker hereunder, if not sooner paid, shall
be due and payable in full on January 31, 1997 (the "Maturity Date").

         2 . Rate of Interest.  This Note shall bear  interest  (computed on the
basis of the actual number of days elapsed over a 360-day  year) until  maturity
on the  Principal  Balance at a rate (the  "Interest  Rate")  equal to  fourteen
percent (14%) per annum from the effective date hereof.  Interest after maturity
shall be payable at a annual rate equal to two percent  (2%) per annum in excess
of the rate otherwise  payable hereunder (the "Default Rate") .In no event shall
the interest charged  hereunder  exceed the maximum  permitted under the laws of
the State of New York.

         3. Payments. Interest,  commencing as of the date hereof and calculated
at the  Interest  Rate  aforesaid  on the  Principal  Balance,  shall be due and
payable in consecutive monthly installments in arrears on the first (1st) day of
each and every  calendar  month during the term of this Note  commencing  on the
first (1st) day of February,  1996,  and continuing on the first day of each and
every month thereafter;  provided,  however,  that Payee shall have the absolute
right (but not the obligation),  in its sole discretion, to add to the Principal

and unpaid  interest,  and the  remainder  of each  payment  shall be applied to
unpaid principal.

accrued interest to the date of such prepayment, at any time, without penalty or
premium.  Prepayments  shall not  postpone  or reduce any  regular  payments  of
interest,  but shall be credited to  installments  of principal,  if any, in the
reverse order of their maturity.

performance  and prompt  payment,  whether at  maturity  or by  acceleration  or
otherwise,  of the full principal  balance of this Note,  together with interest
calculated as aforesaid,  and all  reasonable  legal or other costs  incurred by
Payee in the enforcement thereof against Maker.

terminated for any reason  whatsoever  (each of (i), (ii),  (iii),  (iv), (v) or
(vi)  being an  "Event  of  Default"  )shall  constitute  an  event  of  default
hereunder. Upon the occurrence of an Event of Default, or at any time thereafter
during the  continuance of any such Event of Default,  in addition to and not in
limitation  of all rights and  remedies of the Payee  under the Loan  Agreement,
applicable law or otherwise, all such rights and remedies being cumulative,  not

may, with or without notice to Maker,  declare this Note to be  immediately  due
and payable,  as to the unpaid Principal  Balance,  any accrued  interest,  late
charges and any  expenses,  costs and/or  damages  provided for herein,  without
presentment,  demand,  protest  or other  notice of any  kind,  all of which are
hereby expressly waived.

Agreement  and is or may be secured by (i)  Financing  Statements  by Maker,  as
debtor,  and Payee,  as secured  party,  and (ii) any other  instruments  now or
hereafter  executed  by maker in favor of Payee  which in any manner  constitute
additional security for this Note (the foregoing  documents,  including the Loan
Agreement,  are hereinafter  collectively referred to as the "Loan Documents") .
All of the terms, covenants, conditions and provisions of the Loan Documents are
hereby  incorporated  in and made a part of this  Note to the same  extent as if
herein set forth in full.

         7. Outstanding  Principal  Amount.  The face-amount of this Note is the
total principal  amount that may be outstanding  hereunder at any one time. Each
advance and  readvance by Payee hereof shall be evidenced by this Note,  and any
repayments of principal by Maker shall be credited  against the unpaid principal
balance  due on this  Note,  but shall not  extinguish  this Note in whole or in
part. The unpaid balance due on this Note may increase and decrease as advances,
readvances  and  payments  are made  hereunder,  pursuant to the Loan  Agreement
(including  amendments and supplements  thereto) between Maker and Payee hereof,
and this Note shall  evidence all of the  indebtedness  of Maker  hereunder from
time to time existing pursuant to said Loan Agreement,  including  readvances of
sums already paid. The aggregate  principal  advances and readvances  under this
Note may exceed the face amount hereof,  but the total principal  amount of debt
evidenced  and  outstanding  at any one time by this Note  shall not at any such
time exceed the face amount hereof. At no time shall the aggregate amount of the
additional  principal  advances,  plus the then  unpaid  balance  of this  Note,
including the  additional  principal  advances and readvances  previously  made,
exceed  the  sum of  Five  Hundred  Thousand  Dollars  ($500,000.00),  it  being
understood  and agreed  that Payee  hereof  does not intend to make any loans to
Maker that are not secured by the Loan Agreement and that each and every advance
and  readvance  made at present or  hereafter  to Maker  shall be deemed to be a
fully secured advance evidenced by this Note.

         8 . Waivers.  Maker  hereby  waives  demand,  presentment  for payment,
notice of dishonor, protest and notice of protest and diligence in collection or
bringing  suit  and  agrees  that  Payee  may  accept  partial  payment  without
discharging the obligations evidenced hereby.

         9 . Attorneys'  Fees and Costs;  Waiver of Jury Trial.  Maker agrees to
pay all reasonable  attorneys' fees and costs incurred by Payee in collecting or
attempting  to collect  this Note,  whether by suit or  otherwise.  MAKER HEREBY

BROUGHT BY PAYEE TO COLLECT THIS NOTE AND ALL RIGHTS OF SET-OFF AND ANY RIGHT TO
INTERPOSE COUNTERCLAIMS AND CROSS-CLAIMS.

         10. Applicable Law;Venue; Assigns. This Note is being delivered to, and
accepted by, Payee in New York City, State of New York and shall be governed by,
and construed in accordance  with,  the laws of the State of New York. The Maker
hereby  irrevocably  consents to the nonexclusive  jurisdiction of the courts of
the  State  of New  York  and of any  Federal  court  located  in such  State in
connection  with any action or  proceeding  arising  out of or  relating to this
Note.  The execution and delivery of this Note has been  authorized by the Board
of Directors of Maker. If any term or provision of this Note shall be held to be
illegal,  invalid  or  unenforceable,  the  validity  of  all  other  terms  and
provisions shall in no way be affected thereby. As used herein,  Maker and Payee
shall be deemed to include their respective  successors,  legal  representatives
and assigns, whether by voluntary action of the parties or by operation of law.

     11. Default Rate of Interest. Any late payment of interest or the Principal
Balance  (whether  at maturity  or by  acceleration  of this Note as provided in
Section 5) shall bear interest from the due date of such payment until paid
at the Default Rate.

         12.   Highest   Lawful   Rate.   Anything   herein   to  the   contrary
notwithstanding,  the  obligations of Maker on this Note shall be subject to the
limitation  that to the extent  that  contracting  for or receipt of interest or
interest at the Default Rate  hereunder  would be contrary to  provisions of any
law  applicable  to Payee  limiting  the highest  rate of interest  which may be
lawfully  contracted for, charged or received by Payee,  such amount which would
exceed the highest  lawful rate shall be applied to the  reduction of the unpaid
Principal  Balance due  hereunder and not to the payment of interest or interest
at the Default Rate.

     13. Notices.  Any notice to the parties  provided for in this Note shall be
given by mailing such notice by  certified  or  registered  mail  (personal  and
confidential) to Maker at the following address:

or secured by that certain Loan  Agreement  of even date  herewith  (hereinafter
called  the  "Loan  Agreement")  between  Assignor  and  Assignee  and all other

the form of this  Assignment,  any and all subsequent  subleases upon all or any
part of the  Premises  (it being  understood  and agreed  that no such  specific
Assignment shall be required for such subsequent  subleases to be covered by and
included  within this  Assignment  as provided  herein);  to deliver to Assignee
executed  copies of any and all  renewals  and  extensions  of the Lease and any
sublease  thereunder  and all  subsequent  subleases upon all or any part of the
Premises; and to execute and deliver at the request of Assignee all such further
assurances and assignments in the Premises covered by the Lease, any sublease or
the Rents as  Assignee  shall from time to time  require  and to  deliver  other
records and  instruments,  including but not limited to a rent roll and books of
account, that Assignee shall from time to time require.

         4. Covenants and agrees to receive any and all Rents from or out of the
Premises  in trust  for the use and  benefit  of  Assignee  for  payment  of the
Indebtedness  and the  obligations  of the Premises as set forth  herein,  until
receipt from Assignee of notice of the occurrence of a default  specified in the
Note,  the Loan  Agreement or any other  document or  instrument  evidencing  or
securing  the  Indebtedness  (hereinafter  called a "Notice of  Default").  Upon
receipt from Assignee of a Notice of Default,  each  sublessee or assignee of or
under  the  Lease is  authorized  and  directed  to pay the  Rents  directly  to
Assignee.  Until such time, if any, as Assignee may issue a Notice of Default to
any assignee or sublessee of or under the Lease,  Assignor  shall have the right
to receive such Rents on behalf of Assignee,  provided that Assignor  shall hold
such Rents in trust as a fund to be applied  for the  benefit of and as directed
by Assignee,  and Assignor hereby covenants so to apply the Rents,  before using
any part of the same for any other purposes,  first, to the payment of Rents due
to Landlord  under the Lease;  second,  to the payment of taxes and  assessments
upon the Premises before penalty or interest is due thereon;  third, to the cost
of insurance,  maintenance and repairs to the Premises  required by the terms of
the Lease;  fourth,  to the satisfaction of all other obligations of Assignor as
Tenant as  specifically  set forth in the Lease;  and,  fifth, to the payment of
interest  and  principal  becoming  due on the  Indebtedness.  Upon receipt from
Assignee of a Notice of Default,  an  assignee of and each  sublessee  under the
Lease shall make  payment of the Rents to Assignee as provided  above;  and each
such  assignee and  sublessee  making  payment of Rents  directly to Assignee as
provided  herein  shall be a  released  of all  liability  to the  extent of all
amounts so paid. The receipt by an assignee of or sublessee under the Lease of a
Notice  of  Default  shall be  sufficient  authorization  for such  assignee  or
sublessee  to make all future  payments of Rents  directly to Assignee  and each
such  assignee or sublessee  shall be entitled to rely on such Notice of Default
and shall have no  liability  to Assignor  for any Rents paid to Assignee  after
receipt of such Notice of Default.  Rents  received by Assignee  after  giving a
Notice of Default for any period shall be applied by Assignee to the payment (in
such order as Assignee  shall  determine) of: (a) Rent due to the Landlord under
the Lease, (b) all expenses of operating and maintaining the Premises, including
but not limited to all taxes,  assessments,  charges,  claims, utility costs and
premiums for insurance, and the cost of all alterations, renovations, repairs or
replacements;  all expenses  incident to taking and retaining  possession of the
Premises and/or collecting the Rents due and payable under the any assignment of
or sublease  under the Lease;  and (c) the  Indebtedness,  principal,  interest,
attorney's and collection  fees and other amounts,  in such order as Assignee in
its sole discretion may determine.  In no event will this Assignment  reduce the
Indebtedness  except to the extent,  if any, that Rents are actually received by
Assignee  and  applied  upon  (after  said  receipt)  to  such  Indebtedness  in
accordance with the preceding sentence.  Without impairing its rights hereunder,
Assignee  may,  at its  option,  at any time and from time to time,  release  to
Assignor Rents so received by Assignee or any part thereof.  As between Assignor
and Assignee, and any person claiming by, through or under Assignor,  other than
any  assignee of or  sublessee  under the Lease who has not received a Notice of
Default pursuant to this Paragraph and has paid Rents to Assignor in trust, this
Assignment is intended to be absolute, unconditional and presently effective and
the  provisions  of  this  Paragraph  for  notification  of  an  assignee  of or
sublessees  under the Lease upon the  occurrence  of a default  specified in the
Note, the Loan Agreement or any instrument or document  evidencing,  securing or
otherwise  relating to the  Indebtedness  are intended solely for the benefit of
each such assignee or sublessee and shall never inure to the benefit of Assignor
or any person claiming by, through or under Assignor (other than a sublessee who
has not  received  such  notice).  It shall never be  necessary  for Assignee to
institute legal  proceedings of any kind whatsoever to enforce the provisions of
this Paragraph or this Assignment.

         5.  Covenants  and agrees  that at any time  during  which  Assignor is
receiving  Rents  directly  from any assignee of or  sublessee  under the Lease,
Assignor  shall,  upon receipt of written  direction from Assignee,  make demand
and/or sue for all Rents due and payable under any such  assignment or sublease,
as directed by Assignee,  as it becomes due and payable,  including  Rents which
are past due and unpaid.  In the event Assignor fails to take such action, or at
any time during which Assignor is not receiving  Rents directly from an assignee
of or  sublessee  under the Lease,  Assignee  shall have the right (but shall be
under no duty) to demand, collect and sue for, in its own name or in the name of
Assignor,  all Rents due and payable under any such  assignment or sublease,  as
they becomes due and payable, including Rents which are past due and unpaid.

         6.  Covenants and agrees that Assignee shall not be liable for any loss
sustained by Assignor  resulting from Assignee's failure to sublet the Premises,
or any part  thereof,  or from any other act or omission  of  Assignee  under or
relating  to the Lease or any  sublease,  nor shall  Assignee  be  obligated  to
perform or discharge any  obligation,  duty or liability  under the Lease or any
sublease  by reason of this  instrument  or the  exercise  of rights or remedies
hereunder.  Assignee  shall not be liable  for its  failure to  collect,  or its
failure to exercise  diligence in the  collection of, Rents under any assignment
of the Lease or any sublease thereunder, but shall be accountable only for Rents
that  Assignee  actually  receives.  Assignor  will  indemnify and hold harmless
Assignee (for purposes of this paragraph,  the term "Assignee" shall include the
directors, officers, partners, employees, representatives and agents of Assignee
and any persons or entities  owned or controlled by, owning or  controlling,  or
under  common  control  or  affiliated  with  Assignee)  from and  against,  and
reimburse  Assignee  for, all claims,  demands,  liabilities,  losses,  damages,
causes of action, judgments,  penalties, costs and expenses (including,  without
limitation,  reasonable  attorneys' fees and costs of appeal) incurred under the
Lease or any  assignment  of or  sublease  under  the  Lease by  reason  of this
instrument  or the  exercise  of rights or remedies  hereunder,  or which may be
asserted against  Assignee by reason of any alleged  obligations or undertakings
on its part to perform or discharge  any of the terms,  covenants or  agreements
contained  in the Lease or any  sublease  thereof,  including  specifically  any
obligation  or  responsibility  for any  security  deposits  or  other  deposits
delivered to Assignor by any sublessee  and not actually  delivered to Assignee.
The  indemnities  contained in this  paragraph  shall include  claims,  demands,
liabilities,  losses, damages, causes of action, judgments, penalties, costs and
expenses  (including without limitation,  reasonable  attorneys' fees) resulting
from the negligence of Assignor,  and the gross negligence or willful misconduct
of Assignee. The foregoing indemnities shall not terminate upon release or other
termination  of this  Assignment.  Any amount to be paid under this Paragraph by
Assignor to Assignee shall be a demand obligation owing by Assignor to Assignee,
shall bear interest from the date such amount becomes due until paid at the rate
of interest  payable on matured but unpaid  principal of or interest on the Note
and shall be secured by any other  instrument  securing the  Indebtedness.  This
Assignment  of Lease and Rents shall not operate to place  responsibility,  upon
Assignee for the control,  care,  management or repair of the Premises,  nor for
the carrying out of any of the terms and conditions of the Lease, any assignment
of the Lease or any sublease  thereunder;  nor shall it operate to make Assignee
responsible  or liable for any waste  committed on the Premises by the Assignor,
or any  subtenants  or by any other  parties or for any  dangerous  or defective
condition of the  Premises,  or for any  negligence in the  management,  upkeep,
repair or control of the  Premises  resulting  in loss or injury or death to any
subtenant, licensee, employee or stranger.

         7.  Covenants  and agrees that this  Assignment is primary in nature to
the obligations evidenced by the Note, the Loan Agreement and any other document
or  instrument  given to  evidence  or secure  and  collateralize  or  otherwise
relating to the  Indebtedness  and that any default under this Assignment is and
shall be a default under the Loan  Agreement.  Assignor agrees that Assignee may
enforce this Assignment without first resorting to or exhausting any security or
collateral  securing the payment of the  Indebtedness;  provided  however,  that
nothing herein contained shall prevent Assignee from suing on the Note, the Loan
Agreement  or any  document or  instrument  evidencing,  securing  or  otherwise
relating to the  Indebtedness or exercising any other right thereunder at law or
in equity.

         8. Covenants and agrees that so long as the Indebtedness remain unpaid,
in the  event  any  sublessee  under the  Lease  should  be the  subject  of any
proceeding  under the Federal  Bankruptcy  Code or any other  federal,  state or
local statute which  provides for the possible  termination  or rejection of any
sublease under the Lease  assigned  hereby,  if any sublease is so rejected,  no
settlement  for  damages  shall be made  without  the prior  written  consent of
Assignee, and any check in payment of damages for rejection of any such sublease
will be made payable to Assignee.  Assignor  hereby  assigns any such payment to
Assignee and further covenants and agrees that upon the request of Assignee,  it
will duly endorse to the order of Assignee any such check, the proceeds of which
will  be  applied  to the  Indebtedness,  principal,  interest,  attorneys'  and
collection  fees  and  other  amounts,  in such  order as  Assignee  in its sole
discretion may determine.

         9. Agrees with Assignee that nothing  contained  herein and no act done
or omitted by  Assignee  pursuant  to the  powers  and rights  granted  Assignee
hereunder  shall be deemed to be a waiver by Assignee of its rights and remedies
under  the  Note,  the  Loan  Agreement  or any  other  document  or  instrument
evidencing,  securing or otherwise  relating to the  Indebtedness or a waiver of
curing of any default  hereunder  or under the Note,  the Loan  Agreement or any
other document or instrument  evidencing,  securing or otherwise relating to the
Indebtedness,  and this Assignment is made and accepted without prejudice to any
of the rights and remedies  possessed by Assignee under the terms  thereof.  The
right of  Assignee to collect  said  Indebtedness  and to enforce  any  security
therefor held by it may be exercised by Assignee either prior to, simultaneously
with, or subsequent to any action taken by it hereunder.

         10. If the Indebtedness is paid as the same becomes due and payable and
if all of the covenants,  warranties,  undertakings  and agreements  made in the
Loan  Agreement  and in this  Assignment  are  kept  and  performed,  then  this
Assignment  shall  become  null and void and of no further  force and effect but
neither the Landlord  nor any assignee of or sublessee  under the Lease shall be
required  to take notice of such  termination  until a copy of a release of this
Assignment  shall have been  delivered  to the  Landlord or to such  assignee or
sublessee.

         11.  Agrees  that  Assignee  may take or release any  security  for the
payment of the  Indebtedness,  may release any party  primarily  or  secondarily
liable therefor and may apply any security held by it to the satisfaction of the
Indebtedness or any portion thereof without prejudice to any of its rights under
this Assignment.

         12.  Agrees  that  Assignee  may at any time and from time to time,  in
writing:  (a) waive  compliance  by Assignor  with any  covenant  herein made by
Assignor to the extent and in the manner specified in such writing;  (b) consent
to Assignor doing any act which hereunder  Assignor is prohibited from doing, or
consent to Assignor  failing to do any act which hereunder  Assignor is required
to do, to the extent and in the manner specified in such writing; or (c) release
any part of the Premises  and/or the Lease, or any interest  therein,  from this
Assignment. No such act shall in any way impair the rights of Assignee hereunder
except to the extent specifically agreed to by Assignee in such writing.

         13. Agrees that the rights and remedies of Assignee hereunder shall not
be impaired by any  indulgence,  including  but not limited to (a) any  renewal,
extension  or  modification  which  Assignee  may  grant  with  respect  to  the
Indebtedness,  (b)  any  surrender,  compromise,  release,  renewal,  extension,
exchange or  substitution  which  Assignee  may grant in respect of the Premises
and/or the Lease and/or the Rents or any part  thereof or any interest  therein,
or (c) any release or indulgence granted to any endorser, guarantor or surety of
the Indebtedness.

         14. Agrees that a  determination  that any provision of this Assignment
is unenforceable or invalid shall not affect the  enforceability  or validity of
any other provision and any determination  that the application of any provision
of this  Assignment to any person or  circumstance  is illegal or  unenforceable
shall not affect the  enforceability  or  validity of such  provision  as it may
apply to any other persons or circumstances.

         15. Agrees and covenants  with  Assignee that this  Assignment  and the
terms,  provisions,  representations  and warranties  herein  contained shall be
binding upon Assignor and Assignor's  successors  and assigns,  the Landlord and
all  subsequent  sublessees  of the  Premises  and shall inure to the benefit of
Assignee and Assignee's successors and assigns, including all subsequent holders
of the Note. All references in this  Assignment to Assignor or Assignee shall be
deemed to include all such successors and assigns of such respective party.

         16.  Agrees that within this  Assignment , words of any gender shall be
held and construed to include any other gender, and words in the singular number
shall be held and construed to include the plural and words in the plural number
shall  be held and  construed  to  include  the  singular,  unless  the  context
otherwise requires.

         17.  Agrees  that this  Assignment  may be  executed  in any  number of
counterparts  with the same effect as if all parties  hereto had signed the same
document. All such counterparts shall be construed together and shall constitute
one instrument, but in making proof hereof it shall only be necessary to produce
one such counterpart.

         18. Agrees and covenants with Assignee that this  Assignment  shall not
be  construed  or deemed  made for the benefit of any third party or parties and
shall be  construed in  accordance  with and shall be subject to the laws of the
State of New Jersey.

         19. Agrees and covenants  with Assignee that this  Assignment  contains
the entire agreement  concerning the assignment by Assignor of the Lease and the
Rents  thereunder  between the parties hereto.  No variations,  modifications or
changes  herein or hereof  shall be binding  upon any party  hereto,  unless set
forth in a document duly executed by or on behalf of such party.

         IN WITNESS WHEREOF,  Assignor has executed this Assignment of Lease and
Rents as of the date first above written.

foregoing  now  exist  or may  hereafter  be  amended,  modified,  supplemented,
extended, renewed, restated or replaced, being hereinafter collectively referred
to as the "Financing Agreements").

         Debtors have requested certain  amendments to the Financing  Agreements
and  Congress is willing to agree to such  amendments,  subject to the terms and
conditions  contained herein. By this Amendment,  Congress and Debtors intend to
evidence such amendments.

         In  consideration  of the  foregoing and the  respective  covenants and
agreements contained herein, the parties hereto agree as follows:

     1.  Definitions.  All capitalized terms used herein shall have the meanings
assigned  thereto in the Accounts  Agreement or the other Financing  Agreements,
unless defined herein.

         2.  Notwithstanding  anything to the contrary contained in the Accounts
Agreement or the other Financing  Agreements,  effective as of December 1, 1995,
the  term  "Working  Capital"  shall  mean  as to any  Person  at any  time,  in
accordance with generally accepted accounting principals, as in effect from time
to time, on a consolidated basis with such Person's domestic  subsidiaries,  the
amount equal to the difference between:  (i) the aggregate net book value of all
Current  Assets of such Person and its domestic  subsidiaries  (as determined in
accordance with generally accepted accounting principals, as in effect from time
to  time),  calculating  the book  value of  inventory  for  this  purpose  on a
first-in-first-out  basis,  and (ii) all Current  Liabilities of such Person and
its domestic  subsidiaries (as determined in accordance with generally  accepted
accounting principals, as in effect from time to time).


     3. Minimum Working Capital.  Effective as of December 1, 1995, Section 8(a)
of the Rider is hereby  deleted in its  entirety and the  following  substituted

     4.  Tangible Net Worth.  Effective as of December 1, 1995,  Section 8(c) of

     5. Fee. Debtors hereby jointly and severally agree to pay a facility fee in

Amendment  waiving,  and has no  intention of waiving any other Event of Default
which may be  continuing  on December 1, 1995 or any Event of Default  which may
occur  after  December  1, 1995  (whether  the same or similar  to the  Existing
Default or otherwise) and Congress  reserves the right,  in its  discretion,  to
exercise  any or all of its rights and remedies  arising  under the terms of the
Financing Agreements as a result of any Event of Default which may be continuing
on  December 1, 1995 or any Event of Default  which may occur after  December 1,
1995 (whether the same or similar to the Existing Default or otherwise).


         7.  Representations,  Warranties  and  Covenants.  In  addition  to the
continuing  representations,  warranties  and covenants  heretofore or hereafter
made by Debtors to Congress pursuant to the Financing Agreements, Debtors hereby
represent,  warrant  and  covenant  with  and  to  Congress  as  follows  (which

Debtors  and is in  full  force  and  effect  as of the  date  hereof,  and  the
agreements and  obligations of Debtors  contained  herein  constitute the legal,
valid  and  binding  obligations  of  Debtors  enforceable  against  Debtors  in
accordance with their respective terms.

     8.  Conditions  Precedent.  The  amendments  to  the  Financing  Agreements
provided for herein shall only be effective upon the satisfaction of each of the
following conditions precedent in a manner satisfactory to Congress:

                  (a)  Congress  shall  have  received,  in form  and  substance

     (b) no Event of Default shall have occurred and be continuing  and no event
shall have occurred or condition be existing and continuing  which,  with notice
or passage of time or both, would constitute an Event of Default.

           9. Effect of this Amendment. Except as specifically modified pursuant
hereto,  no other  changes or  modifications  to the  Financing  Agreements  are
intended or implied  and in all other  respects  the  Financing  Agreements  are

     10. Binding  Effect.  This Amendment shall be binding upon and inure to the
benefit  of each of the  parties  hereto  and their  respective  successors  and
assigns.

     11.  Counterparts.  This  Amendment  may  be  executed  in  any  number  of
counterparts, but all of such counterparts shall together constitute but one and
the same agreement.

     12. Governing Law. This Amendment and the rights and obligations  hereunder
of  each  of the  parties  hereto  shall  be  governed  by and  interpreted  and

conditions  contained herein. By this Amendment,  Congress and Debtors intend to
evidence such amendments.

        In  consideration  of the  foregoing  and the  respective  Covenants and
agreements contained herein , the parties hereto agree as follows:

           1.     Definitions.

                  (a)      Amendments to Definitions.

     (i) All references to the term "Maximum  Credit" in the Accounts  Agreement
and any of the other Financing Agreements shall be deemed and each such
reference is hereby amended to mean "$2,500,000".

     (ii) All  references to the term "Renewal  Date" in the Accounts  Agreement
and any of the other Financing Agreements shall be deemed and each such
reference is hereby amended to mean "June 25, 1997".

                (b) Interpretation. All capitalized terms used herein shall have
the meanings  assigned thereto in the Accounts  Agreement or the other Financing
Agreements, unless otherwise defined herein.

     2. Termination.  Section 9.1 of the Accounts Agreement is hereby deleted in

        "9.1 This Agreement  shall become  effective upon  acceptance by you and
shall  continue  in full force and effect for a term  ending  June 25, 1997 (the

upon the occurrence of an Event of Default. We agree that all of the Obligations
shall, if not sooner paid, be absolutely and  unconditionally due and payable in

hereby deleted in its entirety and the following substituted therefor:

     "(iii) at no time  shall the sum of (x) all  Letters  of Credit and (y) the

Worth in an aggregate amount for Weldotron and its consolidated  subsidiaries of
not less than $1,050,000."

        6. Waiver.  Congress  hereby waives any Events of Default as a result of
Debtors'  failure to comply  with  Sections  8(a) and 8(c) of the Rider prior to

continuing  representations,  warranties  and covenants  heretofore or hereafter
made by Debtors to Congress pursuant to the Financing Agreements, Debtors hereby

Debtors  and is in  full  force  and  effect  as of the  date  hereof,  and  the

CORPORATION

For information, please contact:

WELDOTRON CORPORATION (AMEX: WLD)

Varghese Reju, Treasurer and Chief Financial Officer (908) 968-9647

TO:      THE EDITOR

FOR:  IMMEDIATE RELEASE                                       OCTOBER 3, 1995

WELDOTRON MEETING WITH AMEX OFFICIALS
Piscataway,  New Jersey,  October 3, 1995...  Weldotron  Corporation  (AMEX:WLD)
announced that it has been notified by the American Stock Exchange on October 2,
1995 that it is reviewing the  continued  listing  eligibility  of the Company's
Common Stock on the Exchange  because the Company does not fully meet all of the
Exchanges financial guidelines for continued listing.  Specifically, the Company
has  incurred  net losses from  Continuing  Operations  in each of its past nine
fiscal years and its Common Stock has sold for a substantial period of time at a
low price per share.  In this  regard,  the  Exchange  noted that the  Company's
Common  Shares are  currently  trading at $1.00 each and have not traded  higher
than $3.00 since July 1993.

In order to provide the Company with an  opportunity  to present  information in
support of a continued  listing,  the  Exchange  has  scheduled  a meeting  with
representatives  from the Company for October 31, 1995.  The Exchange  will then

Item 5. Other Events.



On May 5, 1995, Weldotron Corporation (the "Company" or "Registrant")  concluded
a loan  transaction in which it borrowed One Million  ($1,000,000)  Dollars from
Lyford Corporation. ("Lyford"). This loan transaction accomplished the extension
of the maturity date of  Registrant's  existing loan from Lyford  Corporation in
the amount of five hundred thousand dollars  ($500,000) which had matured by its
terms on February 28, 1995,  and secured an additional  advance in the amount of
five hundred thousand dollars  ($500,000).  The new obligation is evidenced by a
certain Amended, Extended and Restated Promissory Note dated as of March 1, 1995
(the "Restated  Note").  As of March 5, 1995,  Lyford owned 19.65% of the issued
and outstanding common stock of the Company.  In consideration for the new loan,
the Company  executed and  delivered  to Lyford the  Restated  Note and a Common
Stock Purchase  Warrant.  The new loan is secured by a junior lien on all of the
Company's assets.  The warrant grants to Lyford the right to purchase  1,000,000
shares of the  Company's  common  stock (the  "Initial  Warrant  Number")  at an
initial  exercise  price of One ($1.00)  Dollar per share (the "Initial  Warrant
Price"). The Initial Warrant Number and the Initial Warrant Price are subject to
equitable  adjustment in the event there is a merger or  recapitalization of the
Company,  or the Company  declares a stock dividend.  The Initial Warrant Number
and the  Initial  Warrant  Price  are also  subject  to  adjustment  by means of
anti-dilution  provisions.  The warrant  expires by its terms on April 12, 2005.
The loan transaction  closed pursuant to documents dated as of March 1, 1995 and
in the case of the Warrant, April 13, 1995. These loan documents were contingent
on the Company's  obtaining the consent of its senior lender,  which consent was
obtained on May 5, 1995.
