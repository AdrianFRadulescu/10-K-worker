ITEM 1.  BUSINESS

GENERAL

      U S WEST Communications, Inc. (the "Company") is incorporated under the
laws of the State of Colorado and has its principal offices at 1801 California
Street, Denver, Colorado, 80202, telephone number (303) 896-3099. The Company is
an indirect, wholly-owned subsidiary of U S WEST, Inc.  ("U S WEST").

      The Company was formed January 1, 1991, when Northwestern Bell Telephone
Company ("Northwestern Bell") and Pacific Northwest Bell Telephone Company
("Pacific Northwest Bell") were merged into The Mountain States Telephone and
Telegraph Company ("Mountain Bell"), which simultaneously changed its name to
U S WEST Communications, Inc.  U S WEST acquired ownership of Mountain Bell,
Northwestern Bell and Pacific Northwest Bell on January 1, 1984, when American
Telephone and Telegraph Company ("AT&T") transferred its ownership interests in
these three wholly-owned operating telephone companies to U S WEST.  This
divestiture was made pursuant to a court approved consent decree entitled the
Modification of Final Judgement ("MFJ"), which arose out of an antitrust action
brought by the United States Department of Justice against AT&T.

COMPANY OPERATIONS

  The Company provides telecommunications services in the states of Arizona,
Colorado, Idaho, Iowa, Minnesota, Montana, Nebraska, New Mexico, North Dakota,
Oregon, South Dakota, Utah, Washington and Wyoming (the "14 state region"). The
Company serves approximately  80% of the population in these states and
approximately 40% of the land area. Beginning in 1993, the Company entered into
a process to sell certain rural exchanges over the next several years. It is
currently estimated that such sales could amount to approximately 2.0% of total
network access lines. At December 31, 1993, the Company had approximately
13,843,000 telephone network access lines in service, a 3.7% increase over year
end 1992.

     Under the terms of the MFJ, the 14 state region was divided into 29
geographical areas called local access and transport areas ("LATAs") with each
LATA generally centered on a metropolitan area or other identifiable community
of interest. The principal types of telecommunications services offered by the
Company are (i) local service, (ii) intraLATA long distance service and (iii)
exchange access service (which connects customers to the facilities of interLATA
service providers). For the year ended December 31, 1993, local service,
exchange access service and intraLATA long distance service accounted for 44%,
33% and 17%, respectively, of the sales and other revenues of the Company.
In 1993, revenues from a single customer, AT&T, accounted for approximately
13% of the Company's sales and other revenues.

REGULATION

     The Company is subject to varying degrees of regulation by state
commissions with respect to intrastate rates and service, and access
charge tariffs. Under traditional rate of return regulation, intrastate
rates are generally set on the basis of the amount of revenues needed
to produce an authorized rate of return (refer to page 9 of Management's
Discussion).

                                      PART I

ITEM 1.  BUSINESS (continued)

REGULATION (CONTINUED)

     The Company has sought alternative forms of regulation ("AFOR") plans which
provide for competitive parity,  enhanced pricing flexibility and improved
capability in bringing to market new products and services. In a number of
states where AFOR plans have been adopted, such actions have been accompanied by
requirements to refund revenues, reduce existing rates or upgrade service, any
of which could have adverse short-term effects on earnings. Similar agreements
may have resulted under traditional rate of return regulation (refer to pages 12
and 13 of Management's Discussion).

     The Company is also subject to the jurisdiction of the Federal
Communications Commission ("FCC") with respect to interstate access tariffs
(that specify the charges for the origination and termination of interstate
communications) and other matters. The Company's interstate services have been
subject to price cap regulation since January 1991. Price caps are a form of
incentive regulation and, ostensibly, limit prices rather than profits. However,
the FCC's price cap plan includes sharing of earnings in excess of authorized
levels with interexchange carriers. The Company believes that competition will
ultimately be the determining factor in pricing telecommunications services.
In January 1994, the FCC announced that it will begin reviewing its
current form of regulation.

     In September,  1993, the  FCC adopted  licensing rules  for Personal
Communications Services ("PCS") and announced that it would auction the spectrum
frequencies available for PCS in late 1994. PCS offers users mobile voice and
data communications capabilities similar to existing analog cellular service.
U S WEST intends to pursue PCS opportunities as they become available.

COMPETITION

     Historically, communications, entertainment and information services were
provided by different companies in different industries. The convergence of
these technologies is changing both the competitive environment and the way the
Company does business. This convergence, which is being fueled by technological
advances, will lead to more intense competition from companies with which the
Company has not historically competed.

     The Company's principal current competitors are competitive access
providers ("CAPs"). Competition from CAPs is currently limited to providing
large business customers (with high-volume traffic) private line access to the
facilities of interexchange carriers. In coming years, CAPs could also become
significant competitors for other local exchange services.  MCI announced plans
in early 1994 to build fiber-optic  rings and local switching  infrastructures
in major metropolitan markets, hence providing the ability to compete directly
with the local telephone company.  Additionally,  AT&T's entrance into the
cellular communications market through its proposed acquisition of McCaw
Cellular Communications, Inc. has the potential to create increased competition
in local exchange as well as cellular services. The loss of local exchange
customers to competitors would affect multiple revenue streams, including
those related to local and access services, and long distance network
services, and could have a material, adverse effect on the Company's
operations.

                                  PART I

ITEM 1.  BUSINESS (continued)

COMPETITION (CONTINUED)

     In addition to CAPs and providers of wireless services, a major potential
source of future competition includes cable television companies which may offer
telecommunications and other information services in addition to existing video
services.

     Competition from long distance companies continues to erode the Company's
market share of intraLATA long distance services such as WATS and "800." These
revenues have declined over the last several years as customers have migrated to
interexchange carriers that have the ability to offer these services on both an
intraLATA and interLATA basis. The Company is prohibited from providing
interLATA long distance services.

     The actions of state and federal public policymakers will play an important
role in determining how increased competition affects the Company. The Company
is working with regulators and legislators to help ensure that public policies
keep pace with our rapidly changing industry and allow the Company to bring new
services to the marketplace.

     The Company supports regulatory reform. It is increasingly apparent that
the legal and regulatory framework under which the Company operates, which
includes restrictions on equipment manufacturing, prohibitions on cross-
ownership of cable television by telephone companies and the provision of cable
boundaries, limits both competition and consumer choice. The Company believes
that it is in the public interest to lift these restrictions and to place all
competitors under the same rules to ensure the industry's technological
development and long-term financial health.

COMPETITIVE STRATEGY

     The Company intends to implement its competitive strategy by focusing on
three key objectives: 1) business growth through the development of broadband
networks; 2) customer loyalty through continuous improvement in customer
service; and 3) improved productivity through systems re-engineering and
other cost controls.

ITEM 2.  PROPERTIES

     The properties of the Company do not lend themselves to description by
character and location of principal units. At December 31, 1993, the percentage
distribution of total net telephone plant by major category for the Company was
as follows:

      a.  Connecting lines not on customers'
             premises ............................   36%

      b. Central office equipment ..............     39%

      c. Land and buildings (occupied
             principally by central offices) .....   15%

      d. General equipment and vehicles ........      9%

      e.  Miscellaneous equipment and inside
             wiring (substantially all of which
             are on the premises of customers) ...    1%



     At December 31, 1993, substantially all of the installations of central
office equipment were located in buildings owned by the Company situated on land
which it owns in fee, while many garages, and administrative and business
offices were in leased quarters.

     Total investment in telephone plant increased to $28.0 billion at December
31, 1993, from $26.6 billion at December 31, 1992, after giving effect to
retirements, but before deducting accumulated depreciation. The Company's 1993
capital expenditures of $2.2 billion were substantially devoted to the continued
modernization of rural and urban telephone plant, including investments in fiber
optic cable and the conversion of central offices to digital technology, in
order to improve customer services and network productivity. 1994 capital
expenditures are anticipated to be $2.3 billion and the majority of these are
expected to be financed through internally generated funds.

ITEM 3.  LEGAL PROCEEDINGS

     With respect to lawsuits, proceedings and other claims pending at year-end,
it is the opinion of management that after final disposition, any monetary
liability or financial impact to the Company beyond that provided at year-end,
would not be material to the consolidated financial position of the Company.

</TABLE>

     Income before extraordinary items and cumulative effect of change in
accounting principles decreased $514.7 compared to 1992. Absent the effects of a
restructuring charge, which reduced 1993 income by approximately $534.0, and the
cumulative effect on deferred taxes of the 1993 federally mandated increase in
income tax rates which reduced income by $54.0, income before extraordinary
items and cumulative effect of change in accounting principles increased by
$73.3 or 7.7%. The extraordinary items relate to the discontinuance of
accounting for the Company's operations as a regulated enterprise and the
refinancing of debt to obtain lower financing costs prospectively.  The Company
had a net loss in the prior year due to the adoption of "Employer's Accounting
for Postretirement Benefits Other than Pensions" (SFAS No. 106) and "Employer's
Accounting for Postemployment Benefits" (SFAS No. 112).

OPERATING REVENUES

     Total operating revenues were $8,655.9, a $332.2, or 4.0%, increase
compared to the prior year. In the tables below, price changes primarily
represent the aggregate effects of price changes resulting from regulatory
proceedings and growth represents increased market penetration through both
increased access lines and additional sales to existing customers.  Different
regulatory commissions govern the interstate and intrastate jurisdictions,
resulting in varying price and refund impacts.

- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
</TABLE>

     Local service increased $154.8 primarily due to business growth. The
Company added 498,000 access lines, a record 3.7% increase over the
December 31, 1992, level.

- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
</TABLE>

     The increase in interstate access service of $100.0 was primarily a result
of increased growth partially offset by the effects of price reductions.
Interstate access minutes of use increased 8.5% over the same period in 1992.
Interstate access prices were reduced by approximately $60 annually, effective
July 1, 1993, in addition to $90, effective July 1, 1992, due to FCC mandated
changes which resulted in a cost shift to intrastate jurisdictions.  In addition
to price changes resulting from FCC regulatory actions, an increasingly
competitive market for access services will continue to drive prices down.

  INTRASTATE ACCESS SERVICE

- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
</TABLE>

     The  increase in  intrastate  access  service revenues of $9.2 was due to
increased growth and lower refunds, partially offset by price decreases.

- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
</TABLE>

     Long distance network service increased $21.8 primarily due to increased
growth. This increase was partially offset by price decreases and the impacts of
competition, particularly in the Wide Area Telephone Service ("WATS") and 800
services.

  OTHER SERVICES

     Other services revenue increased $46.4 as a result of growth in billing and
collection services and continued market penetration in voice messaging
services.

OPERATING EXPENSES

     Employee-related costs increased $54.0 over 1992. The increase was a result
of costs associated with customer service initiatives and a lower pension credit
in the current year. Increases in basic compensation costs, including overtime
primarily related to an increase in customer demand and flood damage in the
mid-western states, were essentially offset  by the effects of work-force
reductions.  In 1993, 2,500 employees exited the business under the 1991
restructuring plan. These increases were partially offset by reduced health care
costs.

     Other operating expenses increased $43.2 over the same period last year.
The increases were primarily related to increases in network software costs and
advertising expenses.

     The increase of $31.7 in taxes other than income taxes is a result of
adjustments made in 1992 for resolution of certain long-standing appeals.

     Depreciation and amortization expense increased over the same period last
year by $71.1. The increase is attributable to a higher depreciable plant base
and the approval of changed depreciation rates and amortizations by the FCC and
certain state jurisdictions.  A depreciation adjustment in the prior year
resulting from an alternative form of regulation implemented in the state of
Washington partially offset the increase. Prior to the discontinuance of SFAS
No. 71, the  Company's depreciation expense  was based on  regulator approved
depreciation rates. The Company's discontinuance of SFAS No. 71 has resulted in
the use of shorter asset lives (for financial reporting purposes) to more
closely reflect the economic lives of telephone plant. With these new, economic
lives, the Company expects depreciation expense to increase in 1994 by
approximately 3 to 5 percent over the 1993 amount.  The Company continues to
pursue higher regulator-approved depreciation rates and improved capital
recovery within the regulatory environment.

OPERATING EXPENSES (CONTINUED)

     The Company's 1993 results reflect a pretax restructuring charge of $880
million. The restructuring charge includes specific incremental and direct costs
which can be estimated with reasonable accuracy and are clearly identifiable
with the related plan.

     The restructuring plan is designed to provide faster, more responsive
customer services while reducing the costs of providing these services. As part
of the plan, the Company will develop new systems that will enable it to monitor
networks to reduce the risk of service interruptions, activate telephone service
on demand, provide automated inventory systems and centralize its service
centers so that customers can have their telecommunications needs resolved with
one phone call. The Company will also reduce its work force by approximately
8,000 employees by the end of 1996 (in addition to a remaining reduction of
1,000 employees pursuant to the restructuring plan announced in 1991) and
consolidate the operations of its existing 560 customer centers into 26
customer centers in ten cities.

     Following is a schedule of costs included in the restructuring charge:

<TABLE>

                                                                  $880
                                                                ======
</TABLE>

     Employee separation costs include severance payments, healthcare coverage
and postemployment education benefits. Real estate costs include preparation
costs for the new service centers. The relocation and retraining costs are
related to moving employees to the sites of the new service centers and
retraining employees on the new methods and systems required in the new,
restructured mode of operation. Systems development includes the replacement of
existing, single-purpose systems with new systems designed to provide
integrated, end-to-end customer service. There are no costs for asset write-
downs included in the restructuring charge. The work-force reductions would not
be possible without the development and installation of the new systems which
will eliminate the current, labor-intensive interfaces between existing systems.

     The estimated annual cash expenditures relating to the restructuring plan
are $365, $300 and $215 in 1994, 1995 and 1996, respectively. In addition to
these expenditures, the Company anticipates incremental capital expenditures
related to the restructuring plan of $450 over the next three years. The
restructuring plan is estimated to reduce cumulative total employee and related
costs by approximately $525 during the next three years, starting in 1994. These
savings are expected to be largely offset by higher employee salaries and wages
for the remainder of the work force.

MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION.  (DOLLARS IN MILLIONS)

OPERATING EXPENSES (CONTINUED)

     The Company's 1991 restructuring plan was established to partially offset
the effects of future wage, salary and benefit increases. The plan will result
in a work-force reduction of approximately 6,000 employees, of which
approximately 5,000 employees have left the Company as of December 31, 1993.
The 1991 restructuring charge was $240, of which approximately $56 is unused at
December 31, 1993.

INTEREST AND OTHER

     Interest expense decreased $27.7 primarily as a result of the refinancing
of debt in order to take advantage of lower interest rates. Additional detail
of the debt refinancing is provided on page 24 in Note 7 of the Notes to
Consolidated Financial Statements.

     Other expense decreased due to the gain on the sale of several small
exchanges and a reversal of accrued interest based on settlement with several
interexchange carriers related to the 89/90 monitoring period, both occurring in
the current year.  Other items impacting this decrease were a favorable Internal
Revenue Service settlement, a charge for the refinancing of debt and the impacts
of litigation, all occurring in the prior year.

PROVISION FOR INCOME TAXES

     Excluding the effects of the restructuring charge, income tax expense
increased $162.9 over the same period last year.

     The increase in the effective tax rate ("ETR") from 31.4 percent to 36.6
percent resulted primarily from the $54.0 cumulative effect on deferred taxes of
the 1993 federally mandated increase in income tax rates and the ongoing effects
of discontinuing SFAS No.  71, partially offset by the tax effects of the
restructuring charge (refer to Note 4 on page 22 of the Notes to Consolidated
Financial Statements). In 1994, the ETR is expected to increase to approximately
37.5 percent due to the full year ongoing impact of discontinuing SFAS No. 71.

     In 1993, the Company implemented SFAS No.  109, "Accounting for Income
Taxes." Adoption of this new standard did not have a material effect on the
Company's financial position or results of operations, primarily because of the
Company's 1989 adoption of SFAS No.  96 which reflects deferred income taxes at
current income tax rates.

OTHER ITEMS

ALTERNATIVE FORMS OF REGULATION ("AFOR") AND REGULATORY ACTIVITY

     The Company has sought AFOR plans which provide for competitive parity,
enhanced pricing flexibility and improved capability in bringing to market new
products and services. In addition to the FCC's price cap plan, the Company has
existing AFOR plans in the states of Minnesota, Washington, Oregon, Colorado,
Idaho, Nebraska, North Dakota and South Dakota. In a number of states where AFOR
plans have been adopted, such actions have been accompanied by agreements to
refund revenues, reduce existing prices or upgrade service.

ALTERNATIVE FORMS OF REGULATION ("AFOR") AND REGULATORY ACTIVITY (CONTINUED)

     On August 3, 1993, the FCC announced that it will require that certain
telephone companies, including the Company, allow competitive access providers
to interconnect directly to a telephone company's switching equipment. The
decision extends the current collocation requirement applicable to special
access services to local transport for switched access services. The effect
of this decision will be to increase competition and lower prices for interstate
access services provided to interexchange carriers. The FCC has granted local
telephone companies subject to this requirement additional pricing flexibility.

    There are pending regulatory actions in local regulatory jurisdictions which
call for price decreases, refunds or both. In one such instance, the Utah
Supreme Court has remanded a Utah Public Service Commission ("PSC") order to
the PSC for reconsideration, thereby  establishing two exceptions to  the rule
against retroactive ratemaking: 1) unforeseen and extraordinary events and 2)
misconduct. The Commission's initial order denied a refund request from
interexchange carriers and other parties related to the Tax Reform Act of 1986.
If the Commission finds that either of the exceptions apply, the Company could
be liable for refunds, although at this time any such amount is not reasonably
estimable since the case is still in the discovery process.

DISCONTINUANCE OF SFAS NO. 71

     The Company incurred a non-cash, extraordinary charge of $3.0 billion, net
of an income tax benefit of $2.3 billion, in conjunction with its decision to
discontinue accounting for its operations in accordance with SFAS No.  71,
"Accounting for the Effects of Certain Types of Regulation," as of September 30,
1993. SFAS No. 71 generally applies to regulated companies that meet certain
requirements, including a requirement that a company be able to recover its
costs, competition notwithstanding, by charging its customers at prices
established by its regulators. The Company's decision to discontinue the
application of SFAS No. 71 was based on the belief that competition, market
conditions and the development of broadband technology, more than prices
established by regulators, will determine the future revenues of the Company.
As a result of this change, the remaining asset lives of the Company's telephone
plant have been shortened to more closely reflect the useful (economic) lives of
such plant.  The Company's accounting and reporting for regulatory purposes are
not affected by the change. For additional detail, refer to Note 5 on page 23
in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.

EARLY EXTINGUISHMENT OF DEBT

     During 1993, the Company refinanced long-term debt issues aggregating $2.7
billion in principal amount. These refinancings allowed the Company to take
advantage of favorable interest rates.  Extraordinary costs associated with the
redemptions reduced 1993 net income by $77.2. Additional information is provided
in Note 7 on page 24 in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.

SALE OF CERTAIN RURAL EXCHANGES

     Beginning in 1993, the Company entered into a process to sell certain rural
exchanges over the next several years. It is currently estimated that such sales
could amount to approximately 2.0% of total network access lines.

                     NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
                              (DOLLARS IN MILLIONS)

NOTE 1: SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

BASIS OF PRESENTATION: The Consolidated Financial Statements include the
accounts of U S WEST Communications,  Inc. and its wholly-owned subsidiaries
(the "Company"). The Company is an indirect, wholly-owned subsidiary of U S
WEST, Inc. The Company was formed as a result of the January 1, 1991, merger of
The Mountain States Telephone and Telegraph Company, Northwestern Bell
Telephone Company and Pacific Northwest Bell Telephone Company.  The merger was
accounted for as a transfer of assets among entities under common control
similar to that of a pooling-of-interests.

    In the third quarter of 1993, the Company discontinued accounting for its
operations under Statement of Financial Accounting Standards ("SFAS") No. 71,
"Accounting for the Effects of Certain Types of Regulation." Refer to Note 5 on
page 23 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.

     Certain reclassifications within the Consolidated Financial Statements have
been made to conform to the current year presentation.

CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS: Cash and cash equivalents include highly liquid
investments with original maturities of three months or less which are readily
convertible into cash and which are not subject to significant risk resulting
from changes in interest rates.

MATERIALS AND SUPPLIES: New and reusable materials are carried principally at
average cost, except for significant individual items which are valued based on
specific costs. Non-reusable material is carried at its estimated salvage value.

PROPERTY, PLANT AND EQUIPMENT: The investment in property, plant and equipment
is carried at cost less accumulated depreciation.  Additions, replacements and
substantial betterments are capitalized. Capitalized costs include applicable
salaries and employee benefits, materials, taxes and certain other items. The
cost of repairs and maintenance for property, plant and equipment is charged to
expense as incurred.

    The Company's provision for depreciation of property, plant and equipment is
based on various straight-line group methods using remaining useful (economic)
lives based on industry-wide studies.  Prior to discontinuing SFAS No.  71,
depreciation was based on lives specified by regulatory commissions.  When
depreciable property, plant and equipment is retired or sold, the original cost
less the net salvage value is generally charged to accumulated depreciation.

     The Company capitalized the cost of debt and equity funds as a component of
plant construction. This cost was amortized over the remaining service lives of
the plant, resulting in higher depreciation expense. Total amounts capitalized
by the Company were $19.1, $23.4 and $30.5 in 1993, 1992 and 1991,
respectively, and were included as an element of other expense, prior to the
discontinuance of SFAS No. 71.  Subsequent to the discontinuance of SFAS No.
71, amounts capitalized will be offset against interest expense.

REVENUE RECOGNITION: Local telephone service revenues are generally billed
monthly in advance.  These revenues are  recognized when services  are
provided. Nonrecurring and usage sensitive revenues derived from installation,
exchange access and long distance services are billed and recognized monthly
as services are provided.

NOTE 2: MAJOR CUSTOMER

     The Company provides network access services to interexchange carriers, the
largest volume of which is provided to AT&T. During 1993, 1992 and 1991,
billings for all services to AT&T approximated $1,159, $1,191 and $1,243,
respectively. The decreases are primarily due to price decreases prescribed by
the Federal Communications Commission ("FCC"). Related accounts receivable at
December 31, 1993 and 1992, totaled $97 and $106, respectively.

NOTE 3: RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS

    The Company purchases various services, as noted below, from affiliated
companies. The amount paid by the Company for these services is determined in
accordance with FCC and state cost allocation rules, which prescribe various
cost allocation methodologies that are dependent upon the service provided.
Management believes that such cost allocation methods are reasonable. The
costs of those services are billed to the regulated company.

     It is not practicable to provide a detailed estimate of the expenses which
would be recognized on a stand-alone basis. However, the Company believes that
corporate services, including those related to shareholder relations,
procurement, tax, legal and human resources, are obtained more economically
through affiliates than they would be on a stand-alone basis, since the Company
absorbs only a portion of the total costs. Additionally, through its 1/7
ownership interest in Bellcore (see footnote 1 below), the Company obtains
benefits associated with research and development activities which exceed the
Company's share of the total costs.

     The Company's operations include the following charges for these services:

NOTE 4: RESTRUCTURING CHARGES

     The Company's 1993 results reflect a pretax restructuring charge of $880
million. The restructuring charge includes specific incremental and direct costs
which can be estimated with reasonable accuracy and are clearly identifiable
with the related plan.

     The restructuring plan is designed to provide faster, more responsive
customer services while reducing the costs of providing these services. As part
of the plan, the Company will develop new systems that will enable it to monitor
networks to reduce the risk of service interruptions, activate telephone service
on demand, provide automated inventory systems and centralize its service
centers so that customers can have their telecommunications needs resolved with
one phone call. The Company will also reduce its work force by approximately
8,000 employees by the end of 1996 (in addition to a remaining reduction of
1,000 employees pursuant to the restructuring plan announced in 1991) and
consolidate the operations of its existing 560 customer centers into 26
customer centers in ten cities.

     Following is a schedule of costs included in the restructuring charge:


<TABLE>
       <S>                                              <C>
       Employee separation                                 $235
       Real estate                                          120
       Relocation                                           105
       Retraining                                            60
       Systems development                                  360
                                                         ------
                                                           $880
                                                         ======
</TABLE>

     Employee separation costs include severance payments, healthcare coverage
and postemployment education benefits. Real estate costs include preparation
costs for the new service centers. The relocation and retraining costs are
related to moving employees to the sites of the new service centers and
retraining employees on the new methods and systems required in the new,
restructured mode of operation.  Systems development includes the replacement
of existing, single-purpose systems with new systems designed to provide
integrated, end-to-end customer service. There are no costs for asset
write-downs included in the restructuring charge. The work-force reductions
would not be possible without the development and installation of the new
systems which will eliminate the current, labor-intensive interfaces
between existing systems.

     The Company's 1991 restructuring plan was established to partially offset
the effects of future wage, salary and benefit increases. The plan will result
in a work-force reduction of approximately 6,000 employees, of which
approximately 5,000 employees have left the Company as of December 31, 1993.
The 1991 restructuring charge was $240, of which approximately $56 is unused
at December 31, 1993.

NOTE 5: DISCONTINUANCE OF SFAS NO. 71

     The Company incurred a non-cash, extraordinary charge of $3.0 billion, net
of an income tax benefit of $2.3 billion, in conjunction with its decision to
discontinue accounting for its operations in accordance with SFAS No.  71,
"Accounting for the Effects of Certain Types of Regulation," as of September 30,
1993. SFAS No. 71 generally applies to regulated companies that meet certain
requirements, including a requirement that a company be able to recover its
costs, competition notwithstanding, by charging its customers at prices
established by its regulators. The Company's decision to discontinue the
application of SFAS No. 71 was based on the belief that competition, market
conditions and the development of broadband technology, more than prices
established by regulators, will determine the future revenues of the Company.
As a result of this change, the remaining asset lives of the Company's telephone
plant have been shortened to more closely reflect the useful (economic) lives of
such plant.

    Following is a list of the major categories of property, plant and equipment
and the manner in which lives were affected by the discontinuance of
SFAS No. 71:

NOTE 6: FAIR VALUE OF FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS

    The carrying value of cash, short-term investments and other current amounts
receivable and payable approximate fair value because of their short maturity.
The fair value of the Company's long-term debt is estimated based on quoted
market prices where available. If not available, fair value is based on
discounting future cash flows using current interest rates. As of December 31,
1993 and 1992, the carrying amount of the Company's debt was $5,352 and $5,000,
respectively, and the fair value was $5,500 and $5,100, respectively.  The fair
value of debt includes the effect of variable-to-fixed interest rate swaps on
notional principal amounts of $200 at December 31, 1993.

NOTE 9: CONTINGENCIES

      There are pending regulatory actions in local regulatory jurisdictions
which call for price decreases, refunds or both. In one such instance, the
Utah Supreme Court has remanded a Utah Public Service Commission ("PSC") order
to the PSC for reconsideration, thereby  establishing two exceptions to
the rule against retroactive ratemaking: 1) unforeseen and extraordinary events
and 2) misconduct. The Commission's initial order denied a refund request from
interexchange carriers and other parties related to the Tax Reform Act of 1986.
If the Commission finds that either of the exceptions apply, the Company could
be liable for refunds, although at this time any such amount is not reasonably
estimable since the case is still in the discovery process.

NOTE 10: EMPLOYEE BENEFITS

PENSION PLANS

     The Company is a participant in a defined benefit pension plan administered
by U S WEST, which covers substantially all management and occupational
employees. Prior to 1993, the Company was a participant in two defined benefit
pension plans administered by U S WEST, which were merged into one plan
effective January 1, 1993. Benefits for management employees are based upon a
final pay formula while occupational benefits are based upon a flat benefit
formula.  The projected unit credit method is used for financial reporting
purposes and the aggregate cost method for funding purposes. No funding was
required in 1993, 1992 or 1991. Net pension credits for 1993, 1992 and  1991
were $66.0, $101.8 and $100.6, respectively.

POSTRETIREMENT BENEFITS OTHER THAN PENSIONS

     The Company provides certain health care and life insurance benefits for
retired employees.  Effective January 1, 1992, the Company adopted Statement of
Financial Accounting Standards ("SFAS") No.  106, "Employers' Accounting for
Postretirement Benefits Other Than Pensions." SFAS No.  106 mandates that
employers reflect in their current expenses an accrual for the cost of providing
retirement medical and life insurance benefits to current and future retirees.
Prior to 1992, the Company recognized these costs as they were paid. Adoption of
SFAS No.  106 resulted in a one-time, non-cash charge against 1992 earnings of
$1,675.3, net of a deferred tax benefit of $1,022.1, for the prior service of
active and retired employees. The Company used the projected unit credit method
for the determination of postretirement medical costs for financial reporting
purposes.

     In conjunction with the adoption of SFAS No. 106, for financial reporting
purposes,  the Company  elected to  immediately recognize  the accumulated
postretirement benefit obligation for current and future retirees, net of the
fair value of plan assets. In 1992, pursuant to SFAS No. 71, "Accounting for the
Effects of Certain Types of Regulation," a regulatory asset associated with the
recognition of the transition benefit obligation was not recorded because of
uncertainties as to the timing and extent of recovery given the Company's
assessment of its long-term competitive environment. However, the FCC and
certain state jurisdictions permit amortization of the transition obligation
over the average remaining service period of active employees for regulatory
accounting purposes.

     Net postretirement benefit costs for 1993 and 1992 were $247.5 and $258.3,
respectively. The amount funded by the Company will generally follow the amount
of expense allowed in regulatory jurisdictions.

OTHER POSTEMPLOYMENT BENEFITS

     The Company also  adopted SFAS No.  112,  "Employers' Accounting for
Postemployment Benefits," effective January 1, 1992. SFAS No. 112 requires that
employers accrue for  the estimated costs of benefits,  such as workers'
compensation and disability, provided to former or inactive employees who are
not eligible for retirement.  Adoption of SFAS No. 112 resulted in a one-time,
non-cash charge against 1992 earnings of $49.1, net of a deferred tax benefit of
$29.9. No adjustment to the postemployment benefit liability was necessary at
December 31, 1993.

NOTE 11: INCOME TAXES

     The provision for income taxes consists of an amount for taxes currently
payable and a provision for tax consequences deferred to future periods in
accordance with SFAS No. 109, "Accounting for Income Taxes," adopted by the
Company effective January 1, 1993. SFAS No. 109 uses a balance sheet approach
that generally allows consideration of expected future income. Prior to 1993,
the Company used the SFAS No. 96 approach that gave no recognition to future
events other than the recovery of assets and settlement of liabilities at their
carrying amounts. The cumulative effect of adopting SFAS No. 109 was not
material to the results of operations.

     The Company is included in the consolidated tax return of U S WEST. Under
an agreement with U S WEST, the Company recognizes income taxes on a separate
return basis. At December 31, 1993 and 1992, the Company had an outstanding tax
payable to U S WEST of $96.3 and $22.9, respectively.

     For financial statement purposes, investment tax credits are being
amortized over the economic lives of the related property, plant and equipment
in accordance with the deferred method of accounting for such credits.

     The components of the provision for income taxes follow:

NOTE 11: INCOME TAXES (Continued)

     Prior to the discontinuance of SFAS  No.  71, the Company recorded
additional deferred taxes and established a corresponding regulatory asset,
primarily related to the cumulative amount of tax  benefits previously flowed
through to ratepayers. In addition,  the Company  recorded a regulatory
liability coincidental  with the reduction of the deferred tax reserves from
higher historical to lower current tax rates.  The  regulatory asset and
liability were  grossed up, in  accordance with SFAS No.  109,  for the tax
effect of future  revenue requirements.  In connection with the discontinuance
of SFAS No.  71, the remaining  balance of the regulatory asset and liability
at  December 31, 1992, and the related  deferred tax asset and liability, were
written off as  described in Note  5 on page  23 of the  Notes to Consolidated
Financial Statements.

     On  August 10,  1993, federal  legislation  was enacted  which increased
the corporate tax rate from  34 percent to 35 percent effective  January 1,
1993.  The cumulative effect on deferred  taxes of the 1993 increase in  income
tax rates was $54.

The year ended 1993 ratio is based on income before extraordinary
charges associated with the decision to discontinue accounting for
the operations of the Company in accordance with SFAS No. 71 of
$3,040.9 and the early extinguishment of debt of $77.2. The year
ended 1993 ratio includes a one-time restructuring charge of $880.0.
Excluding the restructuring charge the ratio of earnings to fixed
charges would have been 4.55.

The year ended 1992 ratio is based on income before the cummulative
effect of change in accounting principles which reduced net income
by $1,724.4.
