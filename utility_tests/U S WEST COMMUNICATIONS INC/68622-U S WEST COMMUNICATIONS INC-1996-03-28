                                    PART I

ITEM 1.     BUSINESS

General

U  S WEST Communications, Inc. ("U S WEST Communications" or the "Company") is
incorporated  under  the  laws  of the State of Colorado and has its principal
offices  at  1801 California Street, Denver, Colorado  80202, telephone number
(303)  896-3099.    The Company is an indirect, wholly owned subsidiary of U S
WEST, Inc.  ("U S WEST").

Company Operations

The Company provides telecommunications services to more than 25 million
residential  and business customers in the states of Arizona, Colorado, Idaho,
Iowa,  Minnesota,  Montana,  Nebraska, New Mexico, North Dakota, Oregon, South
Dakota, Utah, Washington and Wyoming (collectively, the "Region").  The
Company serves approximately 80 percent of the Region's population and
approximately 40 percent of its geographic area.

The  principal types of telecommunications services offered by the Company are
(i)  local  service, (ii) exchange access service (which connects customers to
the facilities of interLATA service providers), and (iii) intraLATA
long-distance  network  service.   For the year ended December 31, 1995, local
service,  exchange  access service and intraLATA long-distance network service
accounted  for 47%, 34% and 13%, respectively, of the sales and other revenues
of the Company.  At December 31, 1995, the Company had approximately
14,847,000  telephone  network  access  lines in service, a 3.6% increase over
year-end 1994.   Excluding the effect of the sale of approximately 95,000
rural  telephone  access  lines  during 1995, access lines increased 4.2% over
year-end  1994.  In 1995, revenues from a single customer, AT&T, accounted for
approximately 12% of the sales and other revenues of the Company.  The Company
expensed $14 million, $23 million and $42 million for research and development
costs in 1995, 1994 and 1993, respectively.

The  Company  incurred  capital  expenditures of approximately $2.7 billion in
1995 and expects to incur approximately $2.5 billion in 1996.  The 1995
capital expenditures of the Company were substantially devoted to the
continued  modernization  of telephone plant, to improve customer services and
to accommodate additional line capability in several states.

<PAGE>
ITEM 2.     PROPERTIES

The properties of the Company do not lend themselves to description by
character and location of principal units.  At December 31, 1995, the
percentage distribution of total net telephone plant by major category for the
Company was as follows:

d.  General purpose computers and other.  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .                      13%
</TABLE>





At December 31, 1995, substantially all of the installations of central office
equipment were located in buildings owned by the Company situated on land
which it owns in fee, while many garages, and administrative and business
offices were in leased quarters.

Total investment in telephone plant increased to $31.0 billion at December 31,
1995, from $29.4 billion at December 31, 1994, after giving effect to
retirements,  but  before  deducting  accumulated depreciation.  The Company's
1995  capital  expenditures  of $2.7 billion were substantially devoted to the
continued  modernization  of  telephone  plant, including investments in fiber
optic cable, to improve customer services and network productivity.  1996
capital  expenditures  are  anticipated to be $2.5 billion and the majority of
these are expected to be financed through internally generated funds.



<PAGE>
ITEM 3.     LEGAL PROCEEDINGS

With respect to lawsuits, proceedings and other claims pending at year-end, it
is the opinion of management that after final disposition, any monetary
liability or financial impact to the Company beyond that provided at year-end,
would not be material to the consolidated financial position of the Company.

(1)  1995 income before extraordinary items includes a gain of $85 on the sales
of certain rural telephone exchanges and $8 for costs associated with U S WEST,
Inc.'s November 1, 1995 recapitalization.
<F2>
(2)  1994 income before extraordinary items includes a gain of $51 on the sales
of certain rural telephone exchanges.
</FN>
</TABLE>


The Company's 1995 income before extraordinary items, excluding the effects of
one-time items described in Note (1) to the table above, was $1,142, an
increase  of $18, or 1.6 percent, compared with $1,124 in 1994, also excluding
the effects of one-time items.  Total revenue growth of 3.2 percent was
largely offset by significantly higher costs incurred to improve customer
service  and  meet  greater  than expected business growth.  Net income growth
will also be limited in 1996 while the Company continues to commit significant
resources to meet customer service objectives and broaden its range of product
and service offerings.

During 1995, the Company refinanced $145 of long-term debt.  Expenses
associated  with the refinancings resulted in extraordinary charges of $8, net
of tax benefits of $5.

Increased  demand  for  the  Company's services resulted in growth in earnings
before interest, taxes, depreciation, amortization and other ("EBITDA") of 5.2
percent  as  compared  with 1994.  The Company believes EBITDA is an important
indicator  of  the  operational  strength of its businesses.  EBITDA, however,
should  not  be  considered as an alternative to operating or net income as an
indicator  of  performance  or  as an alternative to cash flows from operating
activities  as  a  measure of liquidity, in each case determined in accordance
with generally accepted accounting principles ("GAAP").

                       ======  ======  =========  =========  ========  =======  =========  ========
</TABLE>


Approximately  59  percent of the revenues of the Company are derived from the
states of Arizona, Colorado, Minnesota and Washington.  Approximately 29
percent  of  the  access lines in service are devoted to providing services to
business  customers.   The access line growth rate for business customers, who
tend  to be heavier users of the network, has consistently exceeded the growth
rate  of  residential  customers.  During 1995, business access lines grew 5.4
percent while residential access lines increased 2.8 percent.

The primary factors that influence changes in revenues are customer demand for
products  and  services,  price changes (including those related to regulatory
proceedings)  and refunds.  During 1995, revenues from new product and service
offerings  were  $491, an increase of 57 percent as compared with 1994.  These
revenues  primarily  consist  of  caller identification, voice messaging, call
waiting and high-speed data network transmission services.

Local  service  revenues  include local telephone exchange, local private line
and public telephone services.  In 1995, local service revenues increased
principally  as  a  result of higher demand for new and existing services, and
demand  for  second lines.  Local service revenues from new services increased
$92, or 78 percent, as compared with 1994.  Reported total access lines
increased 511,000, or 3.6 percent, of which 161,000 were second lines.  Second
line  installations increased 25.5 percent as compared with 1994.  Access line
growth  was  4.2  percent  adjusted for the sale of approximately 95,000 rural
telephone access lines during the last 12 months.

<PAGE>
Operating Revenues (continued)

Access  charges  are collected primarily from interexchange carriers for their
use  of  the  local exchange network.  For interstate access services there is
also a fee collected directly from telephone customers.  Approximately 33
percent  of  access revenues and 12 percent of total revenues are derived from
providing access service to AT&T.

Higher  revenues from interstate access services were driven by an increase of
9.2 percent in interstate billed access minutes of use.  The increased
business volume more than offset the effects of price reductions and refunds. 
The  Company  reduced  prices  for interstate access services in both 1995 and
1994 as a result of Federal Communications Commission ("FCC") orders and
competitive  pressures.  Intrastate access revenues increased primarily due to
the  impacts of increased business volume and the multiple toll carrier plans,
partially offset by the impacts of rate changes.

Long-distance  revenues are derived from calls made within the LATA boundaries
of  the Region.  During 1995 and 1994, long-distance revenues were impacted by
the implementation of multiple toll carrier plans ("MTCPs") in Oregon and
Washington  in  May  and July 1994, respectively.  The MTCPs essentially allow
independent  telephone  companies to act as toll carriers.  The 1995 impact of
the MTCPs was long-distance revenue losses of $62, partially offset by
increases in intrastate access revenues of $12 and decreases in other
operating  expenses (i.e. access expense) of $42 as compared with 1994.  These
regulatory arrangements have decreased annual net income by approximately $10.
  Similar  changes  in other states could occur, though the impact on 1996 net
income would not be material.

Excluding  the  effects  of the MTCPs, long-distance revenues decreased by 5.9
percent in 1995, primarily due to the effects of competition and rate
reductions.   Long-distance revenues have declined over the last several years
as  customers have migrated to interexchange carriers that have the ability to
offer  these  services on both an intraLATA and interLATA basis.  A portion of
revenues  lost  to  competition, however, are recovered through access charges
paid  by  the  interexchange  carriers.  Erosion in long-distance revenue will
continue  due  to  the  loss of 1+ dialing in Minnesota, effective in February
1996,  and  in Arizona, effective in April 1996.  Annual long-distance revenue
losses  could  approximate  $30  as a result of these changes.  The Company is
partially mitigating competitive losses through competitive pricing of
intraLATA long-distance services.

Revenues from other services primarily consist of billing and collection
services provided to interexchange carriers, voice messaging services,
high-speed data transmission services, and sales of service agreements related
to inside wiring .

<PAGE>
Operating Revenues (continued)

During 1995, revenues from other services increased $22, primarily as a result
of continued market penetration in voice messaging services and sales of
high-speed  data transmission services.  Revenue growth from other services is
also  attributable  to  maintenance  contracts for inside wire services. These
increases  were partially offset by a decrease of $20 in revenues from billing
and  collection  services.   The decline in billing and collection revenues is
primarily  related  to  lower  contract prices and a decrease in the volume of
services provided to AT&T.

</TABLE>


Employee-related expenses include basic salaries and wages, overtime, benefits
(including pension and health care), payroll taxes and contract labor.  During
1995,  improving  customer service was the Company's first priority.  Overtime
payments and contract labor expense associated with customer service
initiatives  increased  employee-related  costs by approximately $178 compared
with  1994.  Expenses related to the addition of approximately 2,800 employees
in 1995 (including the absorption of certain employee transfers from affiliate
companies) also increased employee-related costs.  These expenses were
incurred  to handle the higher than anticipated volume of business and to meet
new  business  opportunities.   Partially offsetting these increases was a $32
reduction in the accrual for postretirement benefits, a $19 decrease in travel
expense and reduced expenses related to employee separations under
reengineering  and streamlining initiatives.  The Company will continue to add
employees to address customer service issues and growth in the core business. 
Costs related to these work-force additions will partially offset the benefits
of  employee  separations achieved through restructuring.  (See "Restructuring
Charge.")

<PAGE>
Costs and Expenses (continued)

Other  operating  expenses include access charges (incurred for the routing of
long-distance traffic through the facilities of independent companies),
network  software expenses and other general and administrative costs.  During
1995,  other  operating expenses decreased primarily due to the effects of the
multiple  toll  carrier  plans  and a reduction in expenses related to project
funding  at Bell Communications Research, Inc. ("Bellcore"), of which U S WEST
Communications has a one-seventh ownership interest.  These decreases in other
operating expenses were partially offset by increases in costs associated with
increased sales of products and services, including bad debt expense.

Taxes other than income taxes, which consist primarily of property taxes,
decreased 1.9 percent in 1995, primarily due to favorable property tax
valuations and mill levies as compared with 1994.  As a result of these
valuations  and  mill levies, 1995 fourth-quarter accruals decreased by $20 as
compared with fourth-quarter 1994.

Increased depreciation and amortization expense was attributable to the
effects of a higher depreciable asset base, partially offset by the effects of
the sales of certain rural telephone exchanges.

Interest  expense  increased primarily as a result of an increased use of debt
financing. The increase in other expense is largely attributable to $8 of
costs associated with U S WEST, Inc.'s November 1, 1995 recapitalization.

The  decrease in the effective tax rate resulted primarily from the effects of
a research and experimentation credit and adjustments for prior periods.

Restructuring Charge

The  Company's  1993 results reflected an $880 restructuring charge (pretax). 
The related restructuring plan (the "Restructuring Plan") is designed to
provide  faster, more responsive customer services while reducing the costs of
providing  these  services.  As part of the Restructuring Plan, the Company is
developing  new  systems and enhanced system functionality that will enable it
to monitor networks to reduce the risk of service interruptions, activate
telephone service on demand, rapidly design and engineer products and services
for customers, and centralize its service centers.  The Company has
consolidated its 560 customer service centers into 26 centers in 10 cities and
plans on reducing its work force by approximately 10,000 employees.  All
service centers are operational and supported by new systems and system
functionality.

The Restructuring Plan is expected to be substantially completed by the end of
1997.  Implementation of the Restructuring Plan has been impacted by growth in
the business and related service issues, new business opportunities, revisions
to system delivery schedules and productivity issues caused by the major
rearrangement  of  resources due to restructuring.  These issues will continue
to affect the timing of employee separations.

The  Company estimates that full implementation of the 1993 Restructuring Plan
will  reduce  employee-related expenses by approximately $400 per year.  These
savings related to work-force reductions will be offset by the effects of
inflation and a variety of other factors.  These factors include costs related
to  the  achievement  of customer service objectives, and increased demand for
existing services.  (See "Costs and Expenses.")

Restructuring Charge (continued)

Employee separation costs include severance payments, health-care coverage and
postemployment education benefits.  Systems development costs include new
systems and the application of enhanced system functionality to existing,
single-purpose  systems  to  provide integrated, end-to-end customer service. 
Real  estate costs include preparation costs for the new service centers.  The
relocation  and  retraining  costs  are related to moving employees to the new
service  centers  and retraining employees on the methods and systems required
in the new, restructured mode of operation.

Employee Separation  Under the Restructuring Plan, the Company anticipates the
separation of 10,000 employees.  Approximately 1,000 employees that were
originally expected to relocate have chosen separation or other job
assignments  and  have  been  replaced.  This increased the number of employee
separations  to  10,000 from 9,000, and increased the estimated total cost for
employee separations to $311 from $281, as compared with the original
estimate.   The $30 cost associated with these additional employee separations
was reclassified from relocation to the reserve for employee separations
during 1995.

Annual employee separations and employee-separation amounts under the
Restructuring Plan follow:

Restructuring Charge (continued)

Systems  Development  The existing information management systems were largely
developed  to  support  a monopoly environment.  These systems were inadequate
due to the effects of increased competition, new forms of regulation and
changing technology that have driven consumer demand for new products and
services that can be delivered quickly, reliably and economically.  The
Company  believes that improved customer service, delivered at lower cost, can
be  achieved by a combination of new systems and introducing new functionality
to  existing systems.  This is a change from the initial strategy which placed
more emphasis on the development of new systems.

The systems development program involves new systems and enhanced system
functionality for systems that support the following core processes:

   Service Delivery - to support service on demand for all products and
 services.  These new systems and enhanced system functionality permit
  customer  calls to be directed to those service representatives who can meet
  their  requirements.   This process will provide enhanced information to the
  service  representatives  regarding the customer requests and the ability of
 the Company to fulfill them.

   Service Assurance - for performance monitoring from one location and remote
  testing  in  the new environment, including identification and resolution of
 faults prior to customer impact.

   Capacity Provisioning - for integrated planning of future network capacity,
 including the installation of software controllable service components.

Certain of the new systems and enhanced system functionality have been
implemented  in  the  service  centers and have simplified the labor-intensive
interfaces  between  systems processes in existence prior to the Restructuring
Plan.    Enhanced system functionality introduced under the Restructuring Plan
since its inception includes the following:

- --    The  ability to determine facilities' availability while the customer is
placing an order;

- --   Automated engineering of central office facilities and automated updating
of central office facilities' records;

- --    The  ability to track the status of complex network design jobs from the
customer's perspective; and


<PAGE>

- --  Systems that accurately diagnose network problems and prepare repair
packages to correct the problems identified.

enhanced system functionality follow:

Systems  expenses  charged  to  current operations consist of costs associated
with the information management function, including planning, developing,
testing  and  maintaining databases for general purpose computers, in addition
to  systems  costs  related to maintenance of telephone network applications. 
Other  systems  expenses are for administrative (i.e. general purpose) systems
which  include customer service, order entry, billing and collection, accounts
payable, payroll, human resources and property records.  Ongoing systems costs
comprised  approximately six percent of total operating expenses in 1995, 1994
and  1993.  The Company expects systems costs charged to current operations as
a percent of total operating expenses to approximate the current level
throughout  1996.    Systems  costs could increase relative to other operating
costs as the business becomes more technology dependent.

Regulatory Issues

On  February 1, 1996, the House and Senate approved the Telecommunications Act
of 1996 (the "1996 Act") which is intended to promote competition between
local telephone companies, long-distance carriers and cable television
operators.  The 1996 Act was signed into law on February 8, 1996, and replaces
the antitrust consent decree that broke up the "Bell System" in 1984.  A major
provision of the legislation includes the preemption of state regulations that
govern competition by allowing local telephone companies, long-distance
carriers and cable television companies to enter each other's lines of
business.    Consequently, the Regional Bell Operating Companies ("RBOCs") are
immediately  permitted  to offer wireline interLATA toll services out of their
regions.  However, to participate in the interLATA long-distance market within
their regions, the RBOCs must first open their local networks to
facilities-based competition by satisfying a detailed checklist of
requirements,  including  requirements  related  to interconnection and number
portability.

Other  key provisions of the 1996 Act: (1) eliminate most of the regulation of
cable television rates within three years and eliminate the ban on
cross-ownership between cable television and telephone companies in small
communities;  (2)  permit  the RBOCs to develop new, competitive cable systems
within their regions and to acquire or build wireless cable systems; (3)
provide  partial  relief from the ban against manufacturing telecommunications
equipment by the RBOCs; and (4) permit wireless operators to provide interLATA
toll service in and out of region without a separate subsidiary and to jointly
market or resell cellular service.

The FCC and state regulators have been given latitude in interpreting and
overseeing the implementation of this legislation, including developing
universal service funding policy.  The extent and timing of future
competition, including the Company's ability to offer in-region interLATA
long-distance  services,  will depend in part on the implementation guidelines
determined  by  the  FCC and state regulators, and how quickly the Company can
satisfy requirements of the checklist.  The Company estimates that fulfillment
of the checklist requirements could occur in the majority of its states within
12 to 18 months.

<PAGE>
Regulatory Issues (continued)

The  Company's  interstate  services have been subject to price cap regulation
since January 1991.  Price caps are an alternative form of regulation designed
to limit prices rather than profits.  However, the FCC's price cap plan
includes  sharing  of earnings in excess of authorized levels.  In March 1995,
the  FCC issued an interim order on price cap regulation.  The price cap index
for  most  services is annually adjusted for inflation, productivity level and
exogenous costs and has resulted in reduced access prices paid by
interexchange  carriers  to local telephone companies.  The interim order also
provides  for  three  productivity options, including a no-sharing option, and
for increased flexibility for adjusting prices downward in response to
competition.    In  1995, the Company selected the lowest productivity option,
while prior to this interim order, the Company used an optional higher
productivity factor in determining its prices.  Consequently, the Company
expects the order to have no significant near-term impact.

There  are  pending  regulatory actions in local regulatory jurisdictions that
call  for  price  decreases,  refunds or both.  In one such instance, the Utah
Supreme  Court  has remanded a Utah Public Service Commission ("PSC") order to
the  PSC  for reconsideration, thereby establishing two exceptions to the rule
against  retroactive  ratemaking:  1) unforeseen and extraordinary events, and
2) misconduct.  The PSC's initial order denied a refund request from
interexchange carriers and other parties related to the Tax Reform Act of
1986.    This  action is still in the discovery process.  If a formal filing -
made  in  accordance with the remand from the Supreme Court - alleges that the
exceptions apply, the range of possible risk is $0 to $150.

The  Company  is  subject to varying degrees of federal and state regulation. 
The Company's regulatory strategy includes working to:

- --  Achieve accelerated capital recovery;

- --  Reprice local services to cover costs and ensure these services are
subsidy free, while lowering toll and access rates to meet competition; and

- --    Ensure  that the new rules associated with the Telecommunications Act of
1996 concerning the unbundling of interconnection, resale of services and
universal service do not advantage one competitor over another.

The  Company  is  currently  working with state regulators to gain approval of
these initiatives.

Interest Rate Risk Management

The Company is exposed to market risks arising from changes in interest rates.
  Derivative  financial instruments are used to manage this risk.  The Company
does not use derivative financial instruments for trading purposes.

The  objective of the interest rate risk management program is to minimize the
total cost of debt. Interest rate swaps are used to adjust the ratio of fixed-
to variable-rate debt.  The market value of the debt portfolio including
interest  rate  swaps, is monitored and compared with predetermined benchmarks
to evaluate the effectiveness of the risk management program.

Notional amounts of interest rate swaps outstanding were $784 and $781 at
December 31, 1995 and 1994, respectively, with various maturities extending to
2001.  The estimated effect of the Company's interest rate derivative
transactions  was to adjust the level of fixed-rate debt from 89 percent to 98
percent  of  the total debt portfolio at December 31, 1995 and from 74 percent
to 86 percent of the total debt portfolio at December 31, 1994.

In  conjunction  with  the 1993 debt refinancing, the Company executed forward
contracts to sell U.S. Treasury bonds to lock in the U.S. Treasury rate
component  of  $1.5  billion  of the future debt issue.  At December 31, 1995,
deferred credits of $8 and deferred charges of $51 on closed forward contracts
are included as part of the carrying value of the underlying debt.  The
deferred  credits  and charges are being recognized as a yield adjustment over
the  life  of  the debt, which matures at various dates through 2043.  The net
deferred  charge  is  directly offset by the lower coupon rate achieved on the
new debt.

Other Items

In connection with U S WEST's February 27, 1996 announcement of a planned
merger  with  Continental Cablevision, U S WEST, Inc.'s credit rating is being
reviewed  by  credit  rating agencies, which may result in a downgrading.  The
credit  rating of the Company was not placed under review by Moody's, has been
reaffirmed  by  Duff  and  Phelps, and is under review by Fitch and Standard &
Poors.

Other Items (continued)

On  October 2, 1995, union members approved a new three-year contract with U S
WEST.    The contract provides for salary increases of 10.6 percent over three
years  effective January 1 of each year.  The contract also provides employees
with a lump sum payment of $1,500 in lieu of wage increases becoming effective
in  August  of  each year.  This lump sum payment is being recognized over the
life of the contract.  The agreement covers approximately 30,000
Communications Workers of America members who work for the Company.

ITEM 8.    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND SUPPLEMENTARY DATA

                      REPORT OF INDEPENDENT ACCOUNTANTS

To the Shareowner and Board of Directors of U S WEST Communications, Inc.

We have audited the consolidated financial statements and the
consolidated  financial  statement  schedule of U S WEST Communications, Inc.
listed  in  the  index on page 40 of this Form 10-K.  The financial statements
and financial statement schedule are the responsibility of the Company's
management.  Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the financial
statements and financial statement schedule based on our audits.

We conducted our audits in accordance with generally accepted auditing
standards.  Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to
obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of
material misstatement.  An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence
supporting  the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements.  An audit
also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant
estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial
statement presentation.  We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis
for our opinion.

In  our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present fairly, in
all material respects, the consolidated financial position of U S WEST
Communications,  Inc.  as  of December 31, 1995 and 1994, and the consolidated
results  of  its  operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in
the period ended December 31, 1995, in conformity with generally accepted
accounting  principles.   In addition, in our opinion, the financial statement
schedule referred to above, when considered in relation to the basic
financial statements taken as a whole, present fairly, in all material
respects, the information required to be included therein.

As  discussed in Note 4 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, the
Company discontinued accounting for its operations in accordance with
Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 71, "Accounting for the
Effects of Certain Types of Regulation," in 1993.

                  NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
                            (Dollars in millions)

NOTE 1: SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

Basis of Presentation  The Consolidated Financial Statements include the
accounts  of  U S WEST Communications, Inc., and its wholly owned subsidiaries
(the  "Company").   The Company is an indirect, wholly owned subsidiary of U S
WEST, Inc. ("U S WEST").  The Company was formed as a result of the January 1,
1991, merger of The Mountain States Telephone and Telegraph Company,
Northwestern Bell Telephone Company and Pacific Northwest Bell Telephone
Company.   The merger was accounted for as a transfer of assets among entities
under common control similar to that of a pooling-of-interests.

Certain  reclassifications  within  the Consolidated Financial Statements have
been made to conform to the current year presentation.

Industry Segment  The Company primarily provides regulated communications
services  to  more  than  25 million residential and business customers in the
Company's  region  (the "Region").  The Region includes the states of Arizona,
Colorado, Idaho, Iowa, Minnesota, Montana, Nebraska, New Mexico, North Dakota,
Oregon,  South  Dakota, Utah, Washington and Wyoming.  Services offered by the
Company include local telephone services, exchange access services (which
connect customers to the facilities of carriers, including long-distance
providers  and  wireless  operators),  and long-distance services within Local
Access and Transport Areas ("LATAs") in the Region.  The Company provides
other products and services, including custom calling, voice messaging, caller
identification and high-speed data applications.

Approximately 59 percent of the Company's revenues are derived from the states
of Arizona, Colorado, Minnesota and Washington.

Significant  Concentrations   The largest volume of the Company's services are
provided to AT&T.  During 1995, 1994 and 1993, revenues related to those
services provided to AT&T were $1,085, $1,130 and $1,159, respectively. 
Related accounts receivable at December 31, 1995 and 1994 totaled $91 and $98,
respectively.   As of December 31, 1995, the Company is not aware of any other
significant  concentration  of business transacted with a particular customer,
supplier or lender that could, if suddenly eliminated, severely impact
operations.

Use  of  Estimates  The preparation of financial statements in conformity with
generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates
and  assumptions  that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements
and accompanying notes.  Actual results could differ from those estimates.

Cash  and  Cash  Equivalents   Cash and cash equivalents include highly liquid
investments  with original maturities of three months or less that are readily
convertible into cash and are not subject to significant risk from
fluctuations in interest rates.


<PAGE>
NOTE 1: SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES  (CONTINUED)

Materials  and Supplies  New and reusable materials of the Company are carried
at average cost, except for significant individual items that are valued based
on  specific  costs.  Nonreusable material is carried at its estimated salvage
value.

Property, Plant and Equipment  The investment in property, plant and equipment
is  carried  at  cost, less accumulated depreciation.  Additions, replacements
and substantial betterments are capitalized.  Costs for normal repair and
maintenance of property, plant and equipment are expensed as incurred.

The  Company's  provision for depreciation of property, plant and equipment is
based on various straight-line group methods using remaining useful (economic)
lives based on industry-wide studies. In third quarter 1993, the Company
discontinued accounting for its regulated telephone operations under Statement
of Financial Accounting Standards ("SFAS") No. 71, "Accounting for the Effects
of  Certain  Types  of  Regulation." (See Note 4 to the Consolidated Financial
Statements.)    Prior  to discontinuing SFAS No. 71, depreciation was based on
lives specified by regulators.

When  the  depreciable property, plant and equipment of the Company is retired
or  sold, the original cost less the net salvage value is generally charged to
accumulated depreciation.

Interest  related  to  qualifying  construction projects is capitalized and is
reflected as a reduction of interest expense.  Prior to discontinuing SFAS No.
71,  capitalized interest was included as an element of other income.  Amounts
capitalized by the Company were $39, $36 and $19 in 1995, 1994 and 1993,
respectively.

Revenue  Recognition    Local  telephone service revenues are generally billed
monthly, in advance, and revenues are recognized the following month when
services are provided.  Revenues derived from exchange access and
long-distance services are billed and recorded monthly as services are
provided.

Financial Instruments  Net interest received or paid on interest rate swaps is
recognized  over  the life of the swaps as an adjustment to interest expense. 
Gains and losses on forward contracts are deferred and recognized as an
adjustment to interest expense over the life of the underlying debt.  Currency
swaps entered into to convert foreign debt to dollar-denominated debt are
combined  with  the  foreign currency debt and accounted for as if fixed-rate,
dollar-denominated debt were issued directly.

<PAGE>
NOTE 1: SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (CONTINUED)

Computer Software  The cost of computer software, whether purchased or
developed internally, is charged to expense with two exceptions.  Initial
operating  systems  software is capitalized and amortized over the life of the
related hardware, and initial network applications software is capitalized and
amortized  over  three years.  Subsequent upgrades to capitalized software are
expensed.  Capitalized computer software of $181 and $146 at December 31, 1995
and 1994, respectively, is recorded in property, plant and equipment. 
Amortization  of  capitalized computer software costs totaled $69, $61 and $37
in 1995, 1994 and 1993, respectively.

Income  Taxes   The provision for income taxes consists of an amount for taxes
currently payable and an amount for tax consequences deferred to future
periods  in  accordance  with  SFAS No. 109.  The Company implemented SFAS No.
109, "Accounting for Income Taxes," in 1993.  Adoption of the new standard did
not have a material effect on the financial position or results of operations,
primarily because of the Company's earlier adoption of SFAS No. 96.

For  financial  statement purposes, investment tax credits are being amortized
over the economic lives of the related property, plant and equipment in
accordance with the deferred method of accounting for such credits.

New Accounting Standards  In 1996, the Company will adopt SFAS No. 121,
"Accounting  for the Impairment of Long-Lived Assets and for Long-Lived Assets
to be Disposed Of."  SFAS No. 121 requires that long-lived assets and
associated  intangibles  be  written down to fair value whenever an impairment
review indicates that the carrying value cannot be recovered on an
undiscounted  cash  flow  basis.  SFAS No. 121 also requires that a company no
longer record depreciation expense on assets held for sale.  The Company
expects  that  the adoption of SFAS No. 121 will not have a material effect on
its financial position or results of operations.

NOTE 2: RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS

The  Company purchases various services, as noted, from affiliated companies. 
The  amount paid by the Company for these services is determined in accordance
with FCC and state cost allocation rules, which prescribe various cost
allocation methodologies that are dependent upon the service provided. 
Management  believes  that  such  cost allocation methods are reasonable.  The
cost of those services are billed to the regulated company.

It  is  not  practicable  to provide a detailed estimate of the expenses which
would  be  recognized  on  a stand-alone basis.  However, the Company believes
that  corporate  services,  including  those related to shareholder relations,
procurement,  tax,  legal  and human resources, are obtained more economically
through affiliates than they would be on a stand-alone basis, since the
Company  absorbs only a portion of the total costs.  Additionally, through its
one-seventh ownership interest in Bellcore (see footnote (1) below), the
Company  obtains  benefits associated with research and development activities
which exceed the Company's share of the total costs.

NOTE 3: RESTRUCTURING CHARGE

The  Company's  1993 results reflected an $880 restructuring charge (pretax). 
The related restructuring plan (the "Restructuring Plan") is designed to
provide  faster, more responsive customer services while reducing the costs of
providing  these  services.  As part of the Restructuring Plan, the Company is
developing  new  systems and enhanced system functionality that will enable it
to monitor networks to reduce the risk of service interruptions, activate
telephone service on demand, rapidly design and engineer new products and
services  for  customers, and centralize its service centers.  The Company has
consolidated its 560 customer service centers into 26 centers in 10 cities and
plans on reducing its work force by approximately 10,000 employees.
Approximately  1,000  employees that were originally expected to relocate have
chosen separation or other job assignments and have been replaced.  This
increased the number of employee separations to 10,000 from 9,000, and
increased  the estimated total cost for employee separations to $311, compared
with $281 in the original estimate.  The $30 cost associated with these
additional employee separations was reclassified from relocation to the
reserve for employee separations during 1995.

The Restructuring Plan is expected to be substantially completed by the end of
1997.  Implementation of the Restructuring Plan has been impacted by growth in
the business and related service issues, new business opportunities, revisions
to system delivery schedules and productivity issues caused by the major
rearrangement  of  resources due to restructuring.  These issues will continue
to affect the timing of employee separations.

NOTE 4: PROPERTY, PLANT AND EQUIPMENT (CONTINUED)

DISCONTINUANCE OF SFAS NO. 71

The  Company  incurred a noncash, extraordinary charge of $3.0 billion, net of
an  income  tax  benefit  of $2.3 billion, in conjunction with its decision to
discontinue accounting for its operations in accordance with SFAS No. 71,
"Accounting  for  the Effects of Certain Types of Regulation," as of September
30, 1993.  SFAS No. 71 generally applies to regulated companies that meet
certain requirements, including a requirement that a company be able to
recover  its  costs, notwithstanding competition, by charging its customers at
prices  established  by  its regulators. The Company's decision to discontinue
application  of  SFAS  No. 71 was based on the belief that competition, market
conditions and technological advances, more than prices established by
regulators, will determine the future cost recovery by the Company.  As a
result  of  this change, the remaining asset lives of the Company's plant were
shortened to more closely reflect the useful (economic) lives of such plant.

Following  is  a list of the major categories of telephone property, plant and
equipment and the manner in which depreciable lives were affected by the
discontinuance of SFAS No. 71:

</TABLE>


The  Company employed two methods to determine the amount of the extraordinary
charge.  The "economic life" method assumed that a portion of the
plant-related effect is a regulatory asset that was created by the
under-depreciation of plant under regulation.  This method yielded the
plant-related adjustment that was confirmed by the second method, a discounted
cash flows analysis.

</TABLE>


Long-term debt consists principally of debentures and medium-term notes.

During  1995,  the Company refinanced $1.5 billion of commercial paper to take
advantage of favorable long-term interest rates.  In addition to the
commercial  paper,  the  Company  refinanced $145 of long-term debt.  Expenses
associated  with  the  refinancing of long-term debt resulted in extraordinary
charges to income of $8, net of tax benefits of $5.

During  1993,  the  Company  refinanced long-term debt issues aggregating $2.7
billion in principal amount.  Expenses associated with the refinancing
resulted  in an extraordinary charge to income of $77, net of a tax benefit of
$48.

Interest  payments,  net  of  amounts capitalized, were $367, $344 and $386 in
1995, 1994 and 1993, respectively.

INTEREST RATE RISK MANAGEMENT

The  Company  enters into interest rate swap agreements to effectively convert
existing commercial paper to fixed-rate debt.  This allows the Company to
achieve interest savings over issuing fixed-rate debt directly.

<PAGE>
NOTE 5: DEBT  (CONTINUED)

Under an interest rate swap, the Company agrees with another party to exchange
interest payments at specified intervals over a defined term.  Interest
payments are calculated by reference to the notional amount based on the
fixed- and variable-rate terms of the swap agreements.  The net interest
received or paid as part of the interest rate swap is accounted for as an
adjustment to interest expense.

During 1995 and 1994, the Company entered into currency swaps to convert Swiss
franc-denominated  debt  to dollar-denominated debt.  This allowed the Company
to achieve interest savings over issuing fixed-rate, dollar-denominated debt. 
The  currency swap and foreign currency debt are combined and accounted for as
if fixed-rate, dollar-denominated debt were issued directly.

The  following table summarizes terms of swaps pertaining to the Company as of
December  31,  1995 and 1994.  Variable rates are indexed to two- and ten-year
constant maturity treasury and 30-day commercial paper rates.

</TABLE>


In 1993, the Company executed forward contracts to sell U.S. Treasury bonds to
lock in the U.S. Treasury rate component of the future debt issue.  At
December 31, 1995, deferred credits of $8 and deferred charges of $51 on
closed  forward  contracts  are  included as part of the carrying value of the
underlying  debt.   The deferred credits and charges are being recognized as a
yield  adjustment  over  the  life of the debt, which matures at various dates
through  2043.  The net deferred charge is directly offset by the lower coupon
rate  achieved on the debt issuance.  At December 31, 1995, there were no open
forward contracts.

The counterparties to these interest rate contracts are major financial
institutions. The Company is exposed to credit loss in the event of
nonperformance  by these counterparties.  The Company manages this exposure by
monitoring the credit standing of the counterparty and establishing dollar and
term limitations which correspond to the respective credit rating of each
counterparty.  The Company does not have significant exposure to an individual
counterparty and does not anticipate nonperformance by any counterparty.

<PAGE>
NOTE 6: FAIR VALUES OF FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS

Fair values of cash equivalents, other current amounts receivable and payable,
and short-term debt approximate carrying values due to their short-term
nature.

The fair values of interest rate swaps are based on estimated amounts the
Company  would receive or pay to terminate such agreements taking into account
current interest rates and creditworthiness of the counterparties.

The fair values of long-term debt are based on quoted market prices where
available  or,  if  not  available, are based on discounting future cash flows
using current interest rates.

NOTE 9: EMPLOYEE BENEFITS

PENSION PLAN

The  Company  participates  in a defined benefit pension plan sponsored by U S
WEST,  which  covers substantially all management and occupational employees. 
Benefits for management employees are based on a final pay formula, while
occupational benefits are based on a flat benefit formula.  The projected unit
credit  method is used for financial reporting purposes and the aggregate cost
method  for funding purposes.  No funding was required in 1995, 1994 or 1993. 
Net pension costs for 1995, 1994 and 1993 were $(2), $0 and $(66),
respectively.

<PAGE>
NOTE 9: EMPLOYEE BENEFITS  (CONTINUED)

POSTRETIREMENT BENEFITS OTHER THAN PENSIONS

The  Company participates in plans sponsored by U S WEST which provide certain
health  care and life insurance benefits to retired employees.  In conjunction
with  the  Company's 1992 adoption of SFAS No. 106, "Employers' Accounting for
Postretirement  Benefits Other Than Pensions," U S WEST elected to immediately
recognize  the  accumulated  postretirement benefit obligation for current and
future  retirees.   However, the Federal Communications Commission and certain
state  jurisdictions permit amortization of the transition obligation over the
average remaining service period of active employees for regulatory accounting
purposes  with  most jurisdictions requiring funding as a stipulation for rate
recovery.

The  Company  used  the  projected unit credit method for the determination of
postretirement  medical and life costs for financial reporting purposes.   Net
postretirement benefit costs for 1995, 1994 and 1993 were $183, $220 and $248,
respectively.  The amount funded by the Company is based on regulatory
accounting requirements.

</TABLE>


The  current  portion  of the deferred tax asset was $240 and $280 at December
31, 1995 and 1994, respectively, resulting primarily from restructuring
charges and compensation related items.

On August 10, 1993, federal legislation was enacted which increased the
corporate  tax  rate  from  34 percent to 35 percent retroactive to January 1,
1993.   The cumulative effect on deferred taxes of the 1993 increase in income
tax rates was $54.


NOTE 11: CONTINGENCIES

There  are  pending  regulatory actions in local regulatory jurisdictions that
call  for  price  decreases,  refunds or both.  In one such instance, the Utah
Supreme  Court  has remanded a Utah Public Service Commission ("PSC") order to
the  PSC  for reconsideration, thereby establishing two exceptions to the rule
against  retroactive  ratemaking:  1) unforeseen and extraordinary events, and
2) misconduct.  The PSC's initial order denied a refund request from
interexchange carriers and other parties related to the Tax Reform Act of
1986.    This  action is still in the discovery process.  If a formal filing -
made  in  accordance with the remand from the Supreme Court - alleges that the
exceptions apply, the range of possible risk to  U S WEST Communications is $0
to $150.

ITEM 9.  Changes In and Disagreements with Accountants on Accounting and
Financial Disclosure.

Coopers  & Lybrand L.L.P. has served as the Company's independent auditor, and
Arthur  Andersen  L.L.P.  has  served as the primary auditing firm for certain
major  subsidiaries  of  U  S WEST, since 1984.  In view of the targeted stock
structure adopted by U S WEST in 1995, U S WEST determined, following a
recommendation of its Audit Committee, that it will be more efficient and
effective for U S WEST to have a single firm perform the auditing function for
its entire business, including the Company.

During  the Company's two most recent fiscal years ended December 31, 1995 and
December  31,  1994,  the reports of Coopers & Lybrand L.L.P. on the Company's
financial  statements  contained  no adverse opinion or disclaimer of opinion,
nor were they qualified or modified as to uncertainty, audit scope or
accounting  principles.  In addition, during such fiscal years and the interim
periods  thereafter:   (1) no disagreements with Coopers & Lybrand L.L.P. have
occurred on any matter of accounting principles or practices, financial
statement  disclosure, or auditing scope or procedure, which disagreements, if
not resolved to the satisfaction of Coopers & Lybrand L.L.P., would have
caused it to make reference to the subject matter of the disagreement in
connection with its report on the Company's financial statements; (2) no
reportable  events  involving Coopers & Lybrand L.L.P. have occurred that must
be  disclosed  under  applicable  securities laws; and (3) the Company has not
consulted  with Arthur Andersen L.L.P. on items that concerned the application
of accounting principles to a specific transaction, either completed or
proposed, or on the type of audit opinion that might be rendered on the
Company's financial statements.

                                      OF

                        U S WEST COMMUNICATIONS, INC.


Pursuant  to  Section  7-110-107 of the Colorado Business Corporation Act, U S
WEST  COMMUNICATIONS, INC. a corporation organized and existing under the laws
of  Colorado,  hereby  restates its Articles of Incorporation and certifies as
follows:


FIRST:       The name of the corporation is U S WEST COMMUNICATIONS, INC.  The
          date of filing of its original Certificate of Incorporation with the
       Secretary of State was July 17, 1911.

SECOND:     That pursuant to Section 7-110-107 of the Colorado Business
        Corporation Act, these Restated Articles of Incorporation were adopted
        by the sole shareholder of the corporation on December 7, 1995, in the
        manner prescribed by the Colorado Business Corporation Act.

THIRD:     That the text of the Restated Articles of Incorporation as
       heretofore amended and supplemented is hereby restated and further
       amended to read in its entirety as follows:

ARTICLE  ONE.    The  name of the Corporation is U S WEST COMMUNICATIONS, INC.
("the Corporation).

ARTICLE  TWO.   The Corporation shall have and may exercise all of the rights,
powers,  and privileges now or hereafter conferred upon corporations organized
under  the  laws  of Colorado; provided, however, that the Corporation shall
not engage in any act or activity which could violate the Modification of
Final Judgment entered August 24, 1982, in United States v. Western Electric,
et  al.,  Case  No.  82-0192, United District Court, District of Columbia, as
amended, modified, supplemented or interpreted by a court of competent
jurisdiction from time to time.  In addition, the Corporation may do
everything  necessary, suitable or proper for the accomplishment of any of its
corporate  purposes.   The Corporation may conduct part or all of its business
in any part of Colorado, the United States, or the world and may hold,

such places.

<PAGE>
ARTICLE THREE.  (a)  The aggregate number of shares of stock which the
Corporation  shall  have  authority  to issue is one (1) share of common stock
without par value.  The share of this class of common stock shall have
unlimited voting rights and shall constitute the sole voting group of the
Corporation,  except  to  the extent any additional voting group or groups may
hereafter  be established in accordance with the Colorado Business Corporation
Act.  The share of this class of common stock shall also be entitled to
receive the net assets of the Corporation upon dissolution.

(b)    Each  shareholder of record shall have one vote for each share of stock
standing  in  his  name  on the books of the Corporation and entitled to vote,
except  that in the election of directors, each shareholder shall have as many
votes  for each share held by him as there are directors to be elected and for
whose election the shareholder has the right to vote.  Cumulative voting shall
not be permitted in the election of directors or otherwise.

(c)    Unless  otherwise  ordered by a court of competent jurisdiction, at all
meetings of the shareholders, one-third of the shares of a voting group
entitled  to  vote  at  such meeting, represented in person or by proxy, shall
constitute a quorum of that voting group.

ARTICLE  FOUR.    The number of directors of the Corporation shall be fixed by
the Bylaws.  The number of directors constituting the current Board of
Directors of the Corporation is three (3).

ARTICLE FIVE.  The address of the Corporation's principal office is 1801

ARTICLE  SIX.  The address of the Corporation's registered office in the State
of Colorado is 1675 Broadway, Denver, Colorado 80202. The name of the

ARTICLE  SEVEN.    The provisions as to the management of the business and the
conduct  of the affairs of the Corporation shall be set forth in the Bylaws of
the  Corporation  or  as approved by the Board of Directors of the Corporation
from time to time, and the same shall be in furtherance of and not in
limitation or exclusion of the powers conferred by the law.

ARTICLE  EIGHT.   In furtherance and not in limitation of the powers conferred
by the Colorado Business Corporation Act, the Board of Directors of the
Corporation  is  expressly authorized and empowered to adopt, amend and repeal
the  Bylaws of the Corporation.  Election of a Director need not be by written
ballot.

ARTICLE  NINE.    These Restated Articles of Incorporation correctly set forth
the provisions of the Articles of Incorporation, as amended.

FOURTH:        That the number of shares of the Corporation outstanding at the
           time of such adoption was one, and the number of shares entitled to
        vote thereon was one.

FIFTH:     That the number of shares voted for the Restated Articles of
       Incorporation was sufficient for approval.

SIXTH:     That upon the issuance of the Restated Certificate of Incorporation
       by the Colorado Secretary of State, these Restated Articles of
          Incorporation shall supersede the original Articles of Incorporation
       and all amendments thereto.

Restated Articles of Incorporation to be signed by Stephen E. Brilz, its
Assistant Secretary, this 19th day of December, 1995.

Colorado, as the Board of Directors may designate or as the business of the
corporation may require from time to time.

     The registered office of the corporation required by the Colorado
Business Corporation Act to be maintained in Colorado may be, but need not be,

may be changed from time to time by the Board of Directors.


                                 ARTICLE TWO

                                Shareholders

     Section 1.  Annual Meeting.  The annual meeting of the shareholders
shall be held on the first Friday in April in each year beginning in 1996, at
an hour to be named in the notice of the meeting, or at such other date and
time as the Board of Directors shall determine, for the purpose of electing
Directors of the corporation and for the transaction of such other business as
may come before the meeting.  If the annual meeting is not held on the day
designated, or at any adjournment thereof, the Board of Directors shall cause
a meeting in lieu thereof to be held as soon thereafter as is convenient.

     Section 2.  Special Meetings.  Special meetings of the shareholders may
be called for any purpose.  Such meetings may be called by the President or by
the Board of Directors, and shall be called by the President at the request of
holders of shares representing at least ten percent (10%) of all of the votes
entitled to be cast on any issue proposed to be considered at the meeting.

     Section 3.  Place of Meeting.  The Board of Directors may designate any
place either within or outside Colorado as the place of meeting for any annual
meeting or for any special meeting.  If no designation is made, or if a
special meeting is called other than by the Board of Directors, the place of
the meeting shall be the principal office of the corporation.

     Section 4.  Notice of Meeting.  Written notice stating the place, date,
and hour of the meeting shall be given delivered not less than ten (10) days
nor more than sixty (60) days before the date of the meeting, except that, (i)
if the authorized shares are to be increased, at least thirty (30) days'

the Colorado Business Corporation Act.  Notice of a special meeting shall
include a description of the purpose or purposes of the meeting.  Notice shall
be given personally or by U.S. mail (postage prepaid), private carrier,
telegraph, teletype, electronically transmitted facsimile or other form of
wire or wireless communication by or at the direction of the President, the
Secretary, or the officer or persons calling the meeting, to each shareholder
of record entitled to vote at such meeting.

     Section 5.  Record Date.  For the purpose of determining shareholders
entitled to (i) notice of or to vote at any meeting of shareholders or any
adjournment thereof, (ii) receive distributions or share dividends, or (iii)
demand a special meeting, or to make a determination of shareholders for any
other proper purpose, the Board of Directors shall fix, in advance, a date as
the record date for the determination of shareholders.  Such date shall be not
more than seventy (70) days, and for a meeting of shareholders, not less than
ten (10) days prior to the date on which the particular action requiring such
determination of shareholders is to be taken.  When a determination of
shareholders entitled to vote at any meeting of shareholders is made as
provided in this Section, such determination shall apply to any adjournment
thereof unless the Board of Directors fixes a new record date, which it must
do if the meeting is adjourned to a date more than one hundred twenty (120)
days after the date fixed for the original meeting.

     Notwithstanding the above, the record date for determining the
shareholders entitled to take action without a meeting or entitled to be given
notice of action so taken shall be the date a writing upon which the action is
taken is first received by the corporation.

     Section 6.  Quorum.  One-third of the votes entitled to be cast on a
matter by a voting group shall constitute a quorum of that voting group for
action on that matter.  If a quorum is present, the affirmative vote of the
majority of the shares represented at the meeting and entitled to vote on the
subject matter shall be the act of the shareholders, unless the vote of a
greater proportion or number is required by law or the Articles of
Incorporation.  If a quorum is not represented at any meeting of the
shareholders, such meeting may be adjourned for a period not to exceed one
hundred twenty (120) days for any one adjournment.

     Section 7.  Proxies.  At all meetings of shareholders, a shareholder
may vote by proxy by signing an appointment form or similar writing, either
personally or by his duly authorized attorney_in_fact.  The proxy appointment
form or similar writing shall be filed with the Secretary of the corporation
before or at the time of the meeting.  The appointment of a proxy is effective
when received by the corporation and is valid for eleven (11) months unless a
different period is expressly provided in the appointment form or similar
writing.

     Section 8.  Informal Action by Shareholders.  Any action required or
permitted to be taken at a meeting of the shareholders may be taken without a
meeting if a written consent (or counterparts thereof) that sets forth the
action so taken is signed by all of the shareholders entitled to vote with
respect to the subject matter thereof and received by the corporation.  Such
consent shall have the same force and effect as a unanimous vote of the
shareholders and may be stated as such in any document.  Action taken under
this Section 8 is effective as of the date the last writing necessary to
effect the action is received by the corporation, unless a different effective
date is specified, in which case such specified date shall be the effective
date for such action.

     Section 3.  Vacancies.  A vacancy occurring in the Board of Directors
may be filled by the affirmative vote of a majority of the shareholders or the
Board of Directors.  If the Directors remaining in office constitute fewer
than a quorum of the Board, the Directors may fill the vacancy by the
affirmative vote of a majority of all the Directors remaining in office. 
Whether elected by the Directors or the shareholders, a Director shall hold

     Section 5.  Special Meetings.  Special meetings of the Board of
Directors may be called at any time by or at the request of the President or
any of the Directors.  The person or persons authorized to call special
meetings of the Board may fix any place, either within or outside Colorado, as

meeting by written notice either personally delivered or mailed to each
Director at his business address, or by notice transmitted by telegraph,

     A Director may waive notice of a meeting before or after the time and
date of the meeting by a writing signed by such Director.  Such waiver shall
be delivered to the corporation for filing with the corporate records. 
Further, attendance of the Director at a meeting shall constitute a waiver of
notice of that meeting, except when the Director attends for the express
purpose of objecting to the transaction of any business at that the meeting
because the meeting was not lawfully called or convened.   Neither the
business to be transacted at, nor the purpose of, any regular or special
meeting of the Board of Directors need be specified in the notice of such
meeting.

     Section 7.  Quorum and Voting.  A majority of the number of Directors
fixed by these Bylaws shall constitute a quorum for the transaction of
business, and the acts of a majority of Directors present at a meeting at
which a quorum is present shall constitute the acts of the Board of Directors.
 If, at any meeting of the Board of Directors, less than a quorum is present,
a majority of those present may adjourn the meeting from time to time without
further notice, for a period not to exceed sixty (60) days at any one

authority to such committee, nor any action by such committee pursuant to its
authority shall alone constitute compliance by any member of the Board of
Directors or a member of the committee in question with his responsibility to
conform to the standard of care set forth in Article Three, Section 12 of
these Bylaws.

     Section 10.  Informal Action by Directors.  Any action required or
permitted to be taken at a meeting of the Directors or any committee
designated by the Board of Directors may be taken without a meeting if a
written consent (or counterparts there) that sets forth the action so taken is
signed by all of the Directors entitled to vote with respect to the action
taken.  Such consent shall have the same force and effect as a unanimous vote
of the Directors or committee members and may be stated as such in any
document.  Unless the consent specifies a different effective date, action
taken under this Section 10 is effective at the time the last Director signs a
writing describing the action taken, unless, before such time, any Director
has revoked his consent by a writing signed by the Director and received by
the President or the Secretary of the corporation.

     Section 11.  Telephonic Meetings.  Members of the Board of Directors or
any committee designated by such Board may participate in a meeting of the
Board or committee by means of communication by which all persons
participating in the meeting can hear each other during the meeting.  Such
participation shall constitute presence at the meeting.

     Section 12.  Standard of Care.  A Director shall perform his duties as
a Director, including, without limitation, his duties as a member of any
committee of the Board, in good faith, in a manner he reasonably believes to
be in the best interests of the corporation, and with the care an ordinarily
prudent person in a like position would exercise under similar circumstances. 
In performing his duties, a Director shall be entitled to rely on information,
opinions, reports or statements, including financial statements and other
financial data, in each case prepared or presented by the persons herein
designated.  However, he shall not be considered to be acting in good faith if
he has knowledge concerning the matter in question that would cause such
reliance to be unwarranted.  A Director shall not be liable to the corporation
or its shareholders for any action he takes or omits to take as a Director,
if, in connection with such action or omission, he performs his duties in
compliance with this Section 12.

     The designated persons on whom a Director is entitled to rely are (i) one
or more officers or employees of the corporation whom the Director reasonably
believes to be reliable and competent in the matters presented, (ii) legal
counsel, public accountant, or other person as to matters which the Director
reasonably believes to be within such person's professional or expert
competence, or (iii) a committee of the Board of Directors on which the
Director does not serve if the Director reasonably believes the committee
merits confidence.

                                 ARTICLE SIX

            Indemnification of Directors, Officers, and Employees

     Section 1.  Scope of Indemnification.

          (a)  The corporation shall indemnify an indemnified representative
against any liability incurred in connection with any proceeding in which the
indemnified representative may be involved as a party or otherwise, by reason
of the fact that such person is or was serving in an indemnified capacity,
except to the extent that any such indemnification against a particular
liability is expressly prohibited by applicable law or where a judgment or
other final adjudication adverse to the indemnified representative
establishes, or where the corporation determines, that his or her acts or
omissions (i) were in breach of such person's duty of loyalty to the
corporation or its shareholders, (ii) were not in good faith or involved
intentional misconduct or a knowing violation of law, or (iii) resulted in
receipt by such person of an improper personal benefit.  The rights granted by
this Article shall not be deemed exclusive of any other rights to which those
seeking indemnification, contribution, or advancement of expenses may be
entitled under any statute, certificate or articles of incorporation,
agreement, contract of insurance, vote of shareholders or disinterested
directors, or otherwise.  The rights of indemnification and advancement of
expenses provided by or granted pursuant to this Article shall continue as to
a person who has ceased to be an indemnified representative in respect of
matters arising prior to such time and shall inure to the benefit of the
heirs, executors, administrators, and personal representatives of such a
person.

          (b)     If an indemnified representative is not entitled to
indemnification with respect to a portion of any liabilities to which such
person may be subject, the corporation shall nonetheless indemnify such
indemnified representative to the maximum extent for the remaining portion of
the liabilities.

          (c)     The termination of a proceeding by judgment, order,
settlement, conviction, or upon a plea of nolo contendere or its equivalent
shall not, of itself, create a presumption that the indemnified representative
is not entitled to indemnification.

          (d)  To the extent permitted by law, the payment of indemnification
provided for by this Article, including the advancement of expenses pursuant
to Section 2, with respect to proceedings other than those brought by or in
the right of the corporation, shall be subject to the conditions that the
indemnified representative shall give the corporation prompt notice of any
proceeding, that the corporation shall have complete charge of the defense of
such proceeding and the right to select counsel for the indemnified
representative, and that the indemnified representative shall assist and
cooperate fully in all matters respecting the proceeding and its defense or
settlement.  The corporation may waive any or all of the conditions set forth
in the preceding sentence.  Any such waiver shall be applicable only to the
specific payment for which the waiver is made and shall not in any way
obligate the corporation to grant such waiver at any future time.  In the
event of a conflict of interest between the indemnified representative and the
corporation that would disqualify the corporation's counsel from representing
the indemnified representative under the rules of professional conduct
applicable to attorneys, it shall be the policy of the corporation to waive
any or all of the foregoing conditions subject to such limitations or
conditions as the corporation shall deem to be reasonable in the
circumstances.

          (e)  For purposes of this Article:

               (1)  "indemnified capacity" means any and all past, present, or
future services by an indemnified representative in one or more capacities as
a director, officer, employee, or agent of the corporation or, at the request
of the corporation, as a director, officer, employee, agent, fiduciary, or
trustee of another corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust, employee
benefit plan, or other entity or enterprise; any indemnified representative
serving an affiliate of the corporation in any capacity shall be deemed to be
doing so at the request of the corporation; an "affiliate of the corporation"
means an entity that directly, or indirectly through one or more
intermediaries, controls, or is controlled by, or is under common control
with, the corporation;

               (2)  "indemnified representative" means any and all directors,
officers, and employees of the corporation and any other person designated as
an indemnified representative by the Board of Directors of the corporation;

               (3)  "liability" means any damage, judgment, amount paid in
settlement, fine, penalty, punitive damage, excise tax assessed with respect
to an employee benefit plan, or cost or expense of any nature (including,
without limitation, expert witness fees, costs of investigation, litigation
and appeal costs, attorneys' fees, and disbursements); and

               (4)  "proceeding" means any threatened, pending, or completed
action, suit, appeal, or other proceeding of any nature, whether civil,
criminal, administrative, or investigative, whether formal or informal,
whether external or internal to the corporation, and whether brought by or in
the right of the corporation, a class of its security holders or otherwise.

          Section 2.  Advancing Expenses.  As provided by the Colorado
Business Corporation Act and to the maximum extent permitted by such law, the
corporation shall pay the reasonable expenses incurred in good faith by an
indemnified representative in advance of the final disposition of a proceeding
described in Section 1.  Before making any such advance payment of expenses,
the corporation shall receive an undertaking by or on behalf of the
indemnified representative to repay such amount if it shall ultimately be
determined that such person is not entitled to be indemnified by the
corporation pursuant to this Article.  Such undertaking shall be an unlimited,
unsecured general obligation of the indemnified representative and shall be
accepted without reference to the ability of such person to make repayment. 
No advance shall be made by the corporation if a determination is reasonably
and promptly made by the Board of Directors by majority vote of a quorum of
disinterested directors, or (if such a quorum is not obtainable or, even if
obtainable, a quorum of disinterest directors so directs) by independent legal
counsel in a written opinion, that, based upon the facts known to the Board or
counsel at the time such determination is made, the indemnified representative
has acted in such a manner as to permit or require the denial of
indemnification pursuant to the provisions of Section 1.


                                ARTICLE SEVEN

                               Miscellaneous

     Section 1.  Corporate Seal.  The official seal for the corporation
shall be circular in form and shall contain the name of the corporation and
the words, "Corporate Seal" and "Colorado."

     Section 2.  Fiscal Year.  The fiscal year of the corporation shall be
as established by the Board of Directors.

     Section 3.  Waiver of Notice.  When any notice is required to be given
to any shareholder or Director of the corporation under the provisions of
these Bylaws or under the provisions of the Articles of Incorporation or under
the provisions of the Colorado Business Corporation Act, a waiver thereof, in
writing, signed by the person entitled to such notice whether before, at, or
after the time stated therein, shall be equivalent to the giving of such
notice.

     Section 4.  Adoption or Amendment of Bylaws.  The Board of Directors
shall have power, to the maximum extent permitted by the Colorado Business
Corporation Act, to make, amend and repeal the Bylaws of the corporation at
any regular or special meeting of the Board unless the shareholders, in
making, amending or repealing a particular bylaw, expressly provide that the
Directors may not amend or repeal such bylaw.  The shareholders also shall
have the power to make, amend or repeal the Bylaws of the corporation at any
annual meeting or at any special meeting called for that purpose.

     Section 5.  Gender.  The masculine gender is used in these Bylaws as a
matter of convenience only and shall be interpreted to include the feminine
and neuter genders as the circumstances indicate.

     Section 6.  Conflicts.  In the event of any irreconcilable conflict
between these Bylaws and either the corporation's Articles of Incorporation or
applicable law, the latter shall control.
