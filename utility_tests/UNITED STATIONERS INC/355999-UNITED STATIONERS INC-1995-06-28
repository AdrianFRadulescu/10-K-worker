IMPORTANT EXPLANATORY NOTE

     On March 30, 1995, pursuant to an Agreement and Plan of Merger, dated
as of February 13, 1995 (the "Merger Agreement"), between Associated
Holdings, Inc., a Delaware corporation ("Associated") and United Stationers
Inc., a Delaware corporation (the "Company") and Associated's related Offer
to Purchase dated February 21, 1995 (the "Offer"), Associated purchased
17,201,839 shares of Common Stock, $0.10 par value (the "Shares"), of the
Company at a purchase price of $15.50 per share, or approximately $266.6
million, from the Company's stockholders.  On March 30, 1995, pursuant to
the terms of the Merger Agreement, Associated was merged with and into the
Company, with the Company surviving (the "Merger"), and immediately
thereafter, Associated Stationers, Inc., a Delaware corporation and wholly
owned subsidiary of Associated ("ASI") was merged with and into United
Stationers Supply Co., an Illinois corporation and wholly owned subsidiary
of the Company ("USSC"), with USSC surviving.  The acquisition of the
Shares by Associated pursuant to the Offer together with the Merger is
referred to herein as the "Acquisition".  Although the Company was the
surviving corporation in the Merger, the transaction was treated as a
reverse acquisition for accounting purposes with Associated as the
acquiring corporation.

     Effective for 1995, the Company changed its fiscal year from a year
end of August 31 to December 31.  A report on Form 8-K was filed on April
26, 1995, reporting that the Company had changed its fiscal year end to
December 31.  This Transition Report on Form 10-K is being filed by the
Company due to the cessation for accounting purposes of the Company as of
March 30, 1995.   The Form 10-K includes the final audited financial
statements of the Company through the date of cessation for the period
September 1, 1994 through March 30, 1995. The following information
reflects the Company prior to the Merger unless otherwise noted.  The
financial statements included in this filing reflect the Company's
historical financial statements only, prior to the Merger,  including the
impact of certain merger-related costs.

     References to Fiscal 1995 included in this document refer to the
transition period from September 1, 1994 through March 30, 1995.  The
fiscal years of 1994, 1993 and 1992  reflect twelve months ended August 31.

     The unaudited Pro Forma Combined Financial Statements for the merged
companies for the year ended December 31, 1994 were included in the
Company's Form 8-K dated April 14, 1995.  See Note 1 to the Consolidated
Financial Statements.

ITEM 1.  BUSINESS

General
   United Stationers Inc. is the parent company for its direct wholly owned
subsidiary, United Stationers Supply Co.  Except where the context  clearly
indicates  otherwise,  the  terms  "Company"  or  "United  Stationers"   as
hereinafter  used  include  United  Stationers  Inc.  together   with   its
subsidiary.

   United  Stationers Supply Co. was incorporated in 1922  under  the  name
Utility  Supply  Co. and has operated under its present  name  since  1960.
United  Stationers  Supply  Co.  serves  office  products  dealers,  office
products  superstores,  mail order houses, specialty  retail  stores,  mass
merchandisers, and sanitary supply distributors.  Its MicroUnited division,
which  distributes  computer products, primarily serves  computer  products
resellers, computer superstores, national computer store chains,  and  mail
order  houses.   Its  furniture division distributes  primarily  to  office
furniture dealers.

   On  June  24,  1992,  United Stationers Supply Co.  acquired  Stationers
Distributing  Company  ("SDC"),  a  privately  held  wholesaler  of  office
products based in Fort Worth, Texas with annual revenues of more than  $400
million.  SDC was immediately merged into United Stationers Supply Co.
                                     

   The  Company  sells its products through a single national  distribution
network  to  more than 14,000 resellers, who in turn sell directly  to  end
users.   These  products  are  distributed substantially  within  24  hours
through  a computer-based network of warehouse facilities and truck  fleets
radiating  from  58  distribution points.  For the Fiscal  1995  transition
period,   no  single  dealer accounted for more than 4%  of  the  Company's
consolidated  net  sales.   The Company's annual net  sales  to  individual
dealers represent only a portion of each dealer's total purchases from  all
sources.

Products
   The Company is engaged in the wholesale distribution of a broad line  of
business  products to more than 14,000 resellers.  The Company  distributes
approximately 25,000 items, including: traditional office supplies;  office
furniture  and  desk accessories; office machines, equipment and  supplies;
and  computer hardware, peripherals and supplies; and facilities management
supplies such as safety and sanitation items.

    The   Company's   products  are  purchased   from   approximately   500
manufacturers.   The  Company  has  distribution  contracts  with   certain
suppliers,  under  which  the  Company's  obligations  to  each  individual
supplier is not material.  For the Fiscal 1995 transition period, no single
supplier  accounted for more than 11.5% of the total dollar amount  of  the
Company's purchases.  The Company historically has purchased on a  purchase
order basis.

Customers
   United  Stationers  serves all segments of the office  products,  office
furniture  and  computer reseller markets.  In addition,  the  Company  now
serves sanitary supply distributors.  The Company offers a menu of programs
and  services designed to meet the diverse needs of each of these  customer
categories.

   The  mainstay of the office products industry continues to be commercial
dealers  who  typically serve large companies, institutions and  government
agencies.   Through  consolidation, these dealers are  getting  larger  and
becoming even more important to the Company.  Commercial dealers remain one
of United Stationers' fastest growing customer classes.

   The  independent  dealer population has been declining  for  some  time,
especially  as  dealerships are acquired and brought under an  umbrella  of
common  ownership.   However,  many  independent  office  products  dealers
continue to thrive, adapting to the highly competitive environment with the
help of resources the Company offers.

   Some  independent dealers have joined forces in marketing and/or  buying
groups.   United  Stationers is the leading wholesale source  for  many  of
these groups, providing not only merchandise but also special programs that
enable these dealers to utilize their combined strengths.

   While  United  Stationers maintains and builds its business  with  these
traditional  dealers, the Company has also initiated  programs  with  major
office  products superstore chains.  The Company has placed  catalog  order
stations  in  some of these stores, providing consumers the opportunity  to
order items that superstores do not typically stock.

   Through  its  furniture division, United Stationers offers  middle-grade
office furniture to both office products and office furniture dealers.  The
Company  also  provides  computer-related products  to  all  categories  of
computer  resellers through its MicroUnited division.  The Company provides
marketing materials and professional expertise to meet the various needs of
these resellers.

Marketing and Sales
   The  Company concentrates its marketing efforts on providing value-added
services  to resellers within the business products industry.  The  Company
distributes  products that are generally available at similar  prices  from
multiple  sources, and most of its customers purchase their  products  from
more  than  one  source.   As a result, the Company  differentiates  itself
through  broad product selection, a high degree of product availability,  a
variety  of  customer  services and expeditious distribution  capabilities.
The  Company's significant inventories and its advanced distribution system
enable  each of the Company's customers to provide a high level of  service
to  end  users  while minimizing the reseller's own inventory requirements.
The  Company maintains sufficient inventory levels to ship from stock  more
than 90% of all items ordered.

   In  addition to emphasizing its broad product line, extensive inventory,
computer  integration and national distribution capabilities, the Company's
marketing  programs  have  relied  upon two  additional  major  components.
First, the Company produces catalogs that are usually custom imprinted with
each  dealer's  name.   These catalogs are sold to dealers  who,  in  turn,
distribute  the catalogs to their customers.  Second, the Company  provides
its  dealers  with  a  variety of services, including  business  management
systems, promotional programs and price updating services.

   The  Company produces numerous catalogs for placement with dealers' end-
user  customers, including: an annual General Line Catalog  listing  22,000
items;   an  annual  office  furniture  catalog  featuring  furniture   and
accessories; a quarterly Concept 2000 catalog offering approximately  1,000
high-volume  commodity products; an annual Universal catalog promoting  the
Company's  private-brand merchandise; an annual Computer  Products  Catalog
offering  hardware, peripherals and supplies; an annual  Computer  Concepts
catalog;   an   annual  Facilities  Management  Supply  catalog   featuring
janitorial  and  sanitation  supplies and ergonomic  products;  a  business
presentation products catalog; and Access, a new promotional catalog.

   An  office  products dealer typically distributes only one  wholesaler's
catalogs.   The  dealer  will often purchase products  to  meet  customers'
orders  from the wholesaler that provided the catalogs.  Consequently,  the
Company  attempts  to  maximize  the  distribution  of  its  catalogs  and,
therefore,  offers  a  rebate and allowance program  that  can  offset  the
purchase  price  of  most catalogs.  In addition, the  Company  provides  a
variety  of  dealer  support and marketing programs that  are  designed  to
create  orders  for  dealers from their end-user customers  throughout  the
year.

   The  Company  began  to focus on niche markets in Fiscal  1991  and  has
expanded  steadily upon this concept since then.  A furniture division  was
established  to offer national delivery and set up capabilities  to  office
products dealers as well as to attract new furniture dealers.  Other  niche
markets include computer-related products, custom-imprinted items, facility
management supplies and business presentation products.

   The  Company  offers its dealers promotional programs at  various  times
throughout  the  year.  These programs offer retailers  special  prices  on
certain  brand-name  and  private-brand  merchandise  along  with  packaged
promotional  materials,  including newspaper and direct  mail  flyers.   In
addition, a support program is offered to help dealers develop their market
through direct mail techniques.

  To help inform dealers of price changes, the Company offers various price
updating  services  in hard copy and computer media formats.   The  Company
publishes  a pricing guide listing manufacturers' suggested retail  prices.
For  computer  updating, the Company provides its price files on  diskettes
and tapes as well as through on-line access.

   The  Company  offers its dealers a range of electronic order  entry  and
business management systems.  The Company benefits by gaining an increasing
share  of  the dealers' business, while the dealers benefit through  better
control   and  administration  of  their  business.   The  Company's   most
sophisticated  electronic  management  system  enables  dealers  to  manage
critical  business  functions including order entry,  purchasing,  pricing,
accounts receivable, accounts payable and inventory control.  In July 1993,
United  Stationers entered into a joint venture, creating a new corporation
called United Business Computers, Inc. to enhance, market and support  this
system.  Other systems are linked to the Company's computer network through
dedicated  or dial-up lines.  These systems allow instant stock checks  and
order entry for the approximately 25,000 items offered by the Company.

Distribution
   The  Company  has  a  national network of 58  distribution  points  that
generally enables the Company to make its entire product line available  to
the customer within 24 hours of order placement.  Each of the Company's  30
Regional  Distribution Centers carries most of the Company's full  line  of
inventory.  The Company supplements its Regional Distribution Centers  with
Local  Distribution Points throughout the United States that serve as will-
call  and  reshipment points for orders filled at the Regional Distribution
Centers.   The  Company's  truck  fleet allows  direct  delivery  from  the
Regional Distribution Centers and Local Distribution Points to the dealers.

   The  Company's  computerized systems enable orders to be  taken  at  any
Regional  Distribution Center and filled from that or  any  other  Regional
Distribution  Center.  Dealers may elect to pick up  their  orders  at  the
Regional  Distribution  Center or choose to  have  them  shipped  from  the
Regional  Distribution  Center to the dealer or directly  to  the  dealer's
customer.   The  merchandise may also be shipped to the Local  Distribution
Point  that is closest to the dealer (or the dealer's customer)  for  will-
call, local delivery or reshipment.

   The Company's ability to readily deliver its products can be impaired by
work  stoppages  by  its  employees.  Although the Company  has  maintained
service  levels during past work stoppages by distributing to its customers
from unaffected distribution centers, profitability has been reduced during
such  periods  as  a  result of higher distribution costs.   The  Company's
service  levels  would also be affected in the event of an interruption  in
operation of its computers and/or telecommunications network on a  company-
wide  scale  for  an  extended period of time.  The Company  has  developed
contingency  plans to limit its exposure.  As the number of  the  Company's
distribution  centers  increases, the operation  of  any  one  distribution
center becomes less significant in relation to the overall operation of the
Company.
                                     

Competition
   The Company competes with office products manufacturers as well as other
wholesale  distributors of business products.  Most wholesale  distributors
conduct  operations regionally and locally, sometimes with limited  product
lines such as writing instruments or computer products.  Other wholesalers,
including   the   Company,  carry  a  full  line  of   business   products.
Manufacturers  typically  sell  their  products  through   a   variety   of
distribution   channels,  including  business  products   wholesalers   and
resellers.  Manufacturers have traditionally been viewed as both  suppliers
to and competitors of wholesalers.

  Competition between the Company and manufacturers is based primarily upon
net  pricing,  minimum  order quantity and product availability.   Although
manufacturers  may provide lower prices to dealers than the  Company  does,
the  Company's  marketing  and catalog programs,  combined  with  speed  of
delivery and its ability to offer dealers a broad line of business products
with lower minimum order quantities, are important factors in enabling  the
Company to compete effectively.  Competition between the Company and  other
wholesalers  is  based  primarily on net pricing  to  dealers,  breadth  of
product  lines,  availability  of products and  other  services,  speed  of
delivery to dealers, and the quality of its services.  The Company believes
it is competitive in each of these areas.

            UNITED STATIONERS INC. AND SUBSIDIARY
           MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF
        FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS


RESULTS OF OPERATIONS


FISCAL 1995 COMPARED TO FISCAL 1994


Transition Period - September 1, 1994 through March 30, 1995

     Net sales were $980.6 million for the transition period
of 1995, a 12.5% increase from net sales of $871.6 million
in the comparable period a year ago.  The increase primarily
reflects growth in unit volume.

     Gross profit as a percent of net sales was 21.1% in the
transition period of 1995, compared with 22.5% in the
comparable year ago period.  This lower margin rate reflects
a shift in product mix and is consistent with the margin
rate achieved in the latter half of Fiscal 1994 (twelve
months ended
August 31).

     Operating expenses as a percent of net sales increased
to 20.6% in the transition period of 1995 from 19.6% in the
comparable period a year ago.  The increase includes $27.8
million of merger-related costs consisting of employment
contracts;  insurance benefits; legal, accounting and other
professional fees; stock options; and letter of credit fees
and other.  Operating expenses as a percent of net sales
prior to the merger-related costs was 17.7% in 1995.  This
decline from the comparable period in 1994 is a result of
savings in employee-related and freight-out expenses.

     Income from operations as a percent of net sales was
 .5% in the transition period of 1995, compared with 2.9% in
the comparable period in 1994.  Income from operations as a
percent of net sales was 3.3% in 1995, excluding the merger-
related costs.

     Other expense was $7.5 million in the transition period
of 1995, compared with $5.7 million in the year-ago period.
The increase was due to higher interest expense from
increased debt to meet working capital and other capital
expenditure needs and higher interest rates on borrowings.

     Income (loss) before income taxes as a percent of net
sales was a loss of .3% in the transition period of 1995,
compared to income of 2.3% in the comparable period of 1994.
Net income (loss) was a loss of $7.2 million in 1995,
compared with income of $11.5 million in 1994.  Net income
(loss) per share was a loss of $0.39 in 1995, compared with
income of $0.62 in 1994.

Fiscal 1994 Compared with Fiscal 1993

     Net sales were $1.5 billion for Fiscal 1994, a 0.2%
increase over Fiscal 1993 reflecting a slight increase in
unit volume.  Sales in the early part of Fiscal 1994 were
affected by a temporary drop in in-stock service levels and
the discontinuing of nearly 12,000 items as a final step in
the consolidation process of the June 1992 acquisition of
Stationers Distributing Company.  Sales were also negatively
impacted by temporary, merger-related operational
disruptions in the west and southwest regions.  Sales grew
in the fourth quarter by 3.4%, reversing the decline
experienced in the prior two quarters.

     Gross margin decreased to 21.9% in Fiscal 1994 from
23.4% in Fiscal 1993.  The decline primarily reflects higher
levels of rebates and volume allowances earned by the
Company's customers as a result of ongoing consolidations.
In addition, gross margin was affected by a LIFO charge (an
increase to "Cost of Sales") of $2.2 million in Fiscal 1994
versus LIFO income (a decrease to "Cost of Sales") of $4.7
million in Fiscal 1993, and a shift in product mix.

     Operating expenses as a percent of net sales decreased
to 19.4% in Fiscal 1994 from 20.3% in Fiscal 1993.  The
decrease is the result of streamlining the Company's work
processes and reducing payroll and freight expense.

     Income from operations as a percent of net sales was
2.5% in Fiscal 1994, compared with 3.1% in Fiscal 1993.

     Interest expense increased in Fiscal 1994 due primarily
to additional debt incurred to support working capital and
other capital expenditures.  Income before income taxes
decreased by 29.4% from Fiscal 1993 to Fiscal 1994.  Net
income per share was $0.85 for Fiscal 1994, a 26.1% decrease
from the $1.15 for Fiscal 1993.

     Certain interim expense and inventory estimates are
recognized throughout the fiscal year relating to shrinkage,
inflation and product mix.  The results of the year-end
close and  physical inventory reflected a favorable
adjustment with respect to such estimates, resulting in
approximately $0.5 million of additional net income, which
is reflected in the fourth quarter of Fiscal 1994.

     The effective tax rates for the fiscal years ending
August 31, 1994 and August 31, 1993 were 39.6% and 42.1%,
respectively.  The decrease is primarily due to the
liquidation of a foreign subsidiary and a decrease in the
effective state income tax rate, offset by an increase in
the non-deductible losses in the Company's foreign operation
and the non-deductible amortization of goodwill.

Fiscal 1993 Compared with Fiscal 1992

     Net sales were $1.5 billion for Fiscal 1993, a 34%
increase over net sales of $1.1 billion for Fiscal 1992.
This increase was due to an increase in sales volume
substantially attributable to the June 1992 acquisition of
Stationers Distributing Company.

     Gross margin increased to 23.4% in Fiscal in Fiscal
1993 from 22.4% in Fiscal 1992, caused by LIFO income (a
decrease to "Cost of Sales") of $4.7 million in Fiscal 1993
versus a LIFO charge (an increase to "Cost of Sales") of
$2.7 million in Fiscal 1992 and a favorable product mix.

     Operating expenses as a percent of net sales increased
to 20.3% in Fiscal 1993 from 20.0% in Fiscal 1992.  This
increase was the result of higher expense levels associated
with offering a free-freight marketing program to customers
and costs related to temporarily managing the separate
product offerings of United Stationers and Stationers
Distributing.  Also, delays in some of our merger-related
facilities consolidations resulted in additional expenses.

     Income from operations as a percent of net sales was
3.1% in Fiscal 1993, compared with 2.4% in Fiscal 1992.

     Interest expense increased in Fiscal 1993 due primarily
to the full-year impact of the additional debt incurred in
connection with the acquisition of Stationers Distributing
and the debt required to meet working capital and other
capital expenditure needs.


                              

     Income before income taxes increased by 82.2% from
Fiscal 1992 to Fiscal 1993.  Net income per share was $1.15
for Fiscal 1993, a 62.0% increase from the $0.71 for Fiscal
1992.

     Certain interim expenses and inventory estimates are
recognized throughout the fiscal year relating to shrinkage,
inflation and product mix.  The results of the year-end
close and physical inventory reflected a favorable
adjustment with respect to such estimates, resulting in
approximately $2.6 million of additional net income, which
is reflected in the fourth quarter of Fiscal 1993.

     The effective tax rates for the fiscal years ending
August 31, 1993 and August 31, 1992 were 42.1% and 43.9%,
respectively.  The decrease is primarily due to a decline in
the non-deductible losses in the Company's foreign operation
and a decrease in the effective state tax rate, offset by an
increase in the Federal tax rate.

Liquidity and Capital Resources

     A change occurred in the Company's liquidity and
capital resources as a result of the March 30, 1995 Merger
between United Stationers Inc. and Associated Holdings,
Inc.; see Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.

     During the first seven months of 1995, funds to support
the Company's working capital and capital expenditure
requirements were generated from borrowings under the
Company's Reducing Revolving Credit and Term Loan Agreement
(the "Credit Agreement") and operating activities.

     The decrease in net cash provided by operations in
Fiscal 1994 ($8.1 million) compared with Fiscal 1993 ($36.0
million) was primarily attributable to a decrease in accrued
liabilities, accounts payable and a decrease in net income,
partially offset by a decrease in accounts receivable and
inventory.

     Net cash used in investing activities in Fiscal 1992
included $37.3 million of cash as part of the purchase price
of Stationers Distributing Company, Inc. (see Note 3 to the
Consolidated Financial Statements).  Net capital
expenditures in Fiscal 1994, 1993 and 1992 were $10.5
million, $30.0 million and $8.2 million, respectively.

     Net cash provided by financing activities in Fiscal
1992 primarily reflects additional debt to finance the
acquisition of Stationers Distributing Company, Inc.

     On March 30, 1995, the Company had $149.0 million of
borrowings outstanding under the Credit Agreement.  The
Credit Agreement, as amended, consisted of $130.0 million
revolving credit facility ("Revolver") and a $30.0 million
term loan ("Term Loan").

     The Revolver provided for revolving credit loans up to
the amount of the commitment until August 31, 1997, at the
Company's option.  The initial $130.0 million commitment
decreases quarterly to $83.6 million as of August 31, 1997
based on quarterly decreases which began in May 1994 as
specified in the Credit Agreement.  Under the terms of the
Credit Agreement, the Company was required to pay a facility
fee of 3/16 of 1% of the total available Revolver.  The Term
Loan matures on September 30, 1995 (or earlier upon certain
subsequent offerings by the Company of debt or equity).
Interest on both loans is payable at varying rates provided
for in the Credit Agreement.

     The Credit Agreement contained certain financial
covenants covering the Company and its subsidiaries on a
consolidated basis, including, without limitation, covenants
relating to the consolidated current ratio, tangible net
worth, capitalization, fixed charge coverage, capital
expenditures and payment of dividends by the Company.

     On February 28, 1995 the Company entered into a loan
agreement which provided for an additional line of credit of
$30.0 million.  Under the terms of the loan agreement, the
Company was required to pay a facility fee of 3/16 of 1% of
the total face amount of the line of credit.  The
termination date for the line of credit is April 30, 1995.
Interest is payable at varying rates provided for in the
Agreement.  As of March 30, 1995, the Company had a $6.0
million outstanding balance under this Agreement.

During the transition period of 1995, capital expenditures
totaled approximately $7.8 million.











































                              
Report of Independent Auditors



To the Stockholders and Board of
Directors of United Stationers Inc. :

     We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance
sheet of United Stationers Inc. and Subsidiary as of March

the responsibility of the Company's management.  Our
responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial

     We conducted our audit in accordance with generally

financial statements are the responsibility of the Company's

these consolidated financial statements based on our audits.

     We conducted our audits in accordance with generally
accepted auditing standards.  Those standards require that
we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance
about whether the consolidated financial statements are free
of material misstatement.  An audit includes examining, on a
test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures
in the consolidated financial statements.  An audit also

believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our
opinion.

     In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements
referred to above present fairly, in all material respects,
the financial position of United Stationers Inc. and

generally accepted accounting principles.

     Our audit was made for the purpose of forming an
opinion on the basic financial statements taken as a whole.
Schedule II is the responsibility of the Company's
management and is presented for purposes of complying with
the Securities and Exchange Commission's rules and is not
part of the basic financial statements.  This schedule has

audit of the basic financial statements and, in our opinion,
fairly states in all material respects the financial data
required to be set forth therein in relation to the basic
financial statements taken as a whole.

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements

1.  Subsequent Event

    On March 30, 1995, pursuant to an Agreement and Plan of Merger, dated
as of February 13, 1995 (the "Merger Agreement"), between Associated
Holdings, Inc., a Delaware corporation ("Associated") and United Stationers
Inc., a Delaware corporation (the "Company") and Associated's related Offer
to Purchase dated February 21, 1995 (the "Offer"), Associated purchased
17,201,839 shares of Common Stock, $0.10 par value (the "Shares"), of the
Company at a purchase price of $15.50 per share, or approximately $266.6
million, from the Company's stockholders.  On March 30, 1995, pursuant to
the terms of the Merger Agreement, Associated was merged with and into the
Company, with the Company surviving (the "Merger"), and immediately
thereafter, Associated Stationers, Inc., a Delaware corporation and wholly
owned subsidiary of Associated ("ASI") was merged with and into United
Stationers Supply Co., an Illinois corporation and wholly owned subsidiary
of the Company ("USSC"), with USSC surviving.  The acquisition of the
Shares by Associated pursuant to the Offer together with the Merger is
referred to herein as the "Acquisition."  Although the Company was the
surviving corporation in the Merger, the transaction was treated as a
reverse acquisition for accounting purposes with Associated as the
acquiring corporation.

    Immediately following the Merger, the number of outstanding Shares was
5,998,077 (or 6,973,720 on a fully diluted basis), of which (i) the former
holders of Class A Common Stock, $0.01 par value, and Class B Common Stock,
$0.01 par value, of Associated ("Associated Common Stock") and warrants or
options to purchase Associated Common Stock in the aggregate owned
4,603,333 Shares constituting approximately 76.7% of the outstanding Shares
and outstanding warrants or options for 975,643 Shares (collectively 80.0%
on a fully diluted basis) and (ii) pre-Merger holders of Shares (other than
Associated-owned Shares and treasury Shares) in the aggregate owned
1,394,744 Shares constituting approximately 23.3% of the outstanding Shares
(or 20.0% on a fully diluted basis).  As used in this paragraph, the term
"Shares" includes shares of Nonvoting Common Stock, $0.01 par value, of the
Company, which are immediately convertible into Shares for no additional
consideration.

    To finance the Offer, refinance existing debt of ASI, the Company and
USSC, repurchase stock options and pay related fees and expenses,
Associated, ASI, USSC and the Company entered into (i) new credit
facilities ("New Credit Facilities") with a group of banks and financial
institutions providing for term loan borrowings of $200.0 million and
revolving loan borrowings of up to $300.0 million and (ii) a senior
subordinated bridge loan facility in the aggregate principal amount of
$130.0 million (the "Subordinated Bridge Facility").  In addition,
simultaneously with the consummation of the Offer, Associated obtained
$12.0 million from the sale of additional shares of Associated Common
Stock, which proceeds were used to finance the purchase of a portion of the
Shares pursuant to the Offer.

    On May 3, 1995, USSC completed the issuance of $150 million of 12 3/4%
Senior Subordinated Notes (the "Notes") due 2005.  The net proceeds of the
Notes (after discount and fees of approximately $5.5 million) were used to
pay certain expenses, to repay the $130.0 million Subordinated Bridge
Facility (together with $1.6 million in accrued and unpaid interest
thereon), to repay a portion of the Tranche A and Tranche B term loans
(totaling approximately $6.5 million) and provide working capital.  In the
event the necessary consents are obtained, the Company is permitted to
redeem the Series B Preferred Stock (approximately $7.0 million).



    The New Credit Facilities contain certain financial covenants covering
the Company and its subsidiaries on a consolidated basis, including,
without limitation, covenants relating to tangible net worth,
capitalization, fixed charge coverage, capital expenditures and payment of
dividends by the Company.

    Effective for 1995, the Company changed its fiscal year from a year end
of August 31 to December 31.  The financial statements included herein
represent the final financial statements of the Company through the date of
the consummation of the Merger.  Future financial statements of the Company
will reflect Associated and its acquisition of the Company, and will be on
the basis of  a December 31 fiscal year end.

    As part of the Merger, the Company incurred approximately $27.8 million
of merger-related costs.  The amount consisted of employment contracts
($9.6 million); insurance benefits ($7.4 million); legal, accounting and
other professional services fees ($5.2 million); stock options ($3.0
million); and letter of credit fees and other ($2.6 million).
Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements
United Stationers Inc. and Subsidiary

2.  Summary of Significant Accounting Policies

Principles of Consolidation

    The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of United
Stationers Inc. and its wholly owned subsidiary ("the Company").
Investments in 20% to 50% owned companies are accounted for by the equity
method.  All significant intercompany accounts and transactions have been
eliminated in consolidation.  Certain prior-year amounts have been
reclassified to conform with current-year presentations.

Revenue Recognition

    Sales and provisions for estimated sales returns and allowances are
recorded at the time of shipment.

Cash and Cash Equivalents

    Investments in low-risk instruments that have original maturities of
three months or less are considered to be cash equivalents.  Cash
equivalents are stated at cost which approximates market value.  The
Company's cash equivalent policy conforms to the requirements of Financial
Accounting Standard No. 95.

Inventories

    Inventories constituting approximately 82% of total inventories at
March  30, 1995, August 31, 1994 and August 31, 1993 have been valued under
the last-in, first-out (LIFO) method with the remainder of the inventory
valued under the first-in, first-out (FIFO) method.  Inventory valued under
the FIFO and LIFO accounting methods are recorded at the lower of cost or
market.  If the lower of FIFO cost or market method of inventory accounting
had been used by the Company for all inventories, merchandise inventories
would have been approximately $21,797,000, $18,854,000 and $16,679,000
higher than reported at March 30, 1995, August 31, 1994 and August 31,
1993, respectively.

    In 1994, liquidations of certain LIFO inventories had the effect of
increasing net earnings by $830,000 or $0.04 per share.

Depreciation and Amortization

    Depreciation and amortization are determined by using the straight-line
method over the estimated useful lives of the assets.

    The estimated useful life assigned to fixtures and equipment is from
two to 10 years; the estimated useful life assigned to buildings does not
exceed 40 years; leasehold improvements and assets under capital leases are
amortized over the lesser of their useful lives or the term of the
applicable lease.

    Goodwill reflecting the excess of cost over the value of net assets of
businesses acquired is being amortized on a straight-line basis over 40
years.  The cumulative amount of goodwill amortized at March 30, 1995,
August 31, 1994 and August 31, 1993 is $2,965,000, $2,315,000 and
$1,200,000, respectively.


Software Capitalization

    The Company capitalizes major internal and external systems development
costs determined to have benefits for future periods.  Amortization expense
is recognized over the periods in which the benefits are realized,
generally not to exceed three years.  Systems development costs capitalized
were $1,896,000, $2,166,000, $1,955,000 and $4,202,000 in 1995, 1994, 1993
and 1992, respectively.  Amortization expense was $1,795,000, $2,376,000,
$2,946,000 and $3,384,000 in 1995, 1994, 1993 and 1992, respectively.

Fair Value of Financial Instruments

    The Company's financial instruments consist primarily of cash and cash
equivalents, trade receivables, trade payables and debt instruments.  The
book value of cash and cash equivalents, trade receivables and trade
payables are considered to be representative of their respective fair
values.

    Borrowings under the Company's Reducing Revolving Credit and Term Loan
Agreement are considered to be at fair market value.  The Company had
approximately $62.4 million, $62.7 million  and $66.1 million of long-term
debt (excluding borrowings under the Company's Reducing Revolving Credit
and Term Loan Agreement) outstanding as of March 30, 1995, August 31, 1994,
and August 31, 1993, respectively.  The approximate fair value was $61.3
million, $59.8 million  and $68.0 million as of March 30, 1995, August 31,
1994 and August 31, 1993, respectively.  The fair value is based on the
current rates offered to the Company for debt of similar maturities.  The
fair values on the long-term debt financial instruments are not necessarily
indicative of the amounts that would be realized in a current market
exchange and exclude any liquidation or origination costs.

Foreign Currency Translation

    All assets and liabilities of the Company's foreign operations are
translated at current exchange rates.  Revenues and expenses are translated
at average exchange rates for the year in accordance with Statement of
Financial Accounting Standard No. 52.  The amounts for all years presented
were immaterial.

Earnings Per Share

    Earnings per share and the effect on earnings per share of potentially
dilutive stock options are computed by the treasury stock method.  This
computation takes into account the weighted average number of shares
outstanding during each year, outstanding stock options and their exercise
prices, and the market price of the stock throughout the year.  The
exercise of outstanding stock options would not result in a material
dilution of earnings per share.
3.  Business Combination and Restructuring Charge


    On June 24, 1992, the Company acquired all of the outstanding capital
stock of SDC Distributing Corp., parent of Stationers Distributing Company,
Inc. ("SDC").  The results of operations of SDC have been included in the
Company's consolidated financial statements since June 25, 1992.

    The following summarized unaudited pro forma results of operations for
the years ended August 31, 1992 and 1991 assume the acquisition occurred at
the beginning of the respective periods.  These pro forma results have been
prepared for comparative purposes only and do not purport to be indicative
of the results of operations that actually would have resulted had the
combination been in effect on the dates indicated, or which may result in
the future.

tax restructuring charge related to severance payments and closing of
certain facilities associated with the acquisition.



4.   Long-Term Debt

 Long-term debt consists of the following amounts (in thousands of dollars):
                                                        1995    1994    1993

          The prevailing prime interest rate at March 30, 1995, August 31,
1994 and August 31, 1993 was 9.0%, 7.8%, and 6.0%, respectively.

          The Company has a $160.0 million Reducing Revolving Credit and Term
Loan Agreement ("Credit Agreement") with a group of seven lenders (the
"Lenders").  The Credit Agreement consists of a $130.0 million revolving
credit facility ("Revolver") and a $30.0 million term loan ("Term Loan").
Proceeds are used to finance working capital requirements and capital
expenditures of the Company.

          The Revolver provides for revolving credit loans up to the amount of
the commitment until August 31, 1997, at the Company's option.  The initial
$130.0 million commitment decreases to $83.6 million as of August 31, 1997
based on quarterly decreases which began in May 1994 as specified in the
Credit Agreement.  As of August 31, 1994, the Revolver commitment is $126.0
million.  Under the terms of the Credit Agreement, the Company is required to
pay a facility fee of 3/16 of 1% of the total available Revolver.  The Term
Loan (as amended) matures on September 30, 1995 (or earlier upon certain
subsequent offerings by the Company of debt or equity).  The Term Loan can be
prepaid without penalty.  Interest on both loans is payable at varying rates
provided for in the Credit Agreement.

          On February 28, 1995, the Company entered into a $30.0 million line
of credit with a major  bank.  This credit facility was entered into to meet
seasonal requirements after the Revolving Credit and Term Loan Agreement was
fully utilized, and bore interest at agreed upon market rates.  The Company
had $6.0 million outstanding under this agreement immediately prior to the
Merger.  This agreement was terminated in connection with the Merger.

     The Credit Agreement contains certain financial covenants covering the
Company and its subsidiaries on a consolidated basis, including, without
limitation, covenants relating to the consolidated current ratio, tangible
net worth, capitalization, fixed charge coverage, capital expenditures and
payment of dividends by the Company.

     The net book value of assets subject to secured mortgages and
industrial development bonds as of March 30, 1995, August 31, 1994 and
August 31, 1993 was $28,128,000, $28,610,000 and $28,962,000, respectively.

     Maturities of long-term debt (excluding amounts borrowed under the
Credit Agreement), for the following periods as indicated, are as follows
(in thousands of dollars):


     Year  (except 1995)                            Amount
     Nine Months Ending December 31, 1995          $ 6,125
     1996                                            8,167
     1997                                            8,218
     1998                                            8,824
     1999                                            6,129
     Later years                                    24,971
                                                   $62,434


      As part of the Merger, approximately $180 million of debt at March
30, 1995 was refinanced.  The refinanced debt consisted of various
mortgages, the Edison, New Jersey industrial development bonds, the private
placement loan, the Term Loan, and Revolver.






















5.  Pension Plans and Postretirement Benefits


    The Company has pension plans in effect for substantially all employees.
Non-contributory plans covering non-union employees provide pension benefits
that are based on years of credited service and a percentage of annual
compensation.  Non-contributory plans covering union members generally provide
benefits of stated amounts based on years of service.  The Company funds the
plans in accordance with current tax laws.

    The Company also has a non-contributory, non-qualified plan ("Supplemental
Benefit Plan") in effect for certain executives.  The Company has not funded
this plan.

    Pension expense in 1995, 1994, 1993 and 1992 was approximately $1,707,000,
$1,755,000, $1,269,000 and $866,000, respectively.

    The following table sets forth the plans' funded status at March 30, 1995,
August 31, 1994  and August 31, 1993 (in thousands of dollars):

1  The Supplemental Benefit Plan was funded and paid out as a result of the
merger.

     The plans' assets consist of debt securities, equity securities and
government securities.  Net periodic pension cost for 1995, 1994, 1993 and 1992
for pension and supplemental benefits plans includes the following components
(in thousands of dollars):



                                        1995    1994    1993    1992

Net periodic pension cost             $1,707  $1,755  $1,269$    866


     The projected benefit obligations for 1995, 1994, 1993 and 1992 were
determined using an assumed discount rate of 7.5%, 7.5%, 7.25%, and 7.5%,
respectively.  In 1995, 1994, 1993, and 1992, the assumed rate of compensation
increase ranged from 0% to 5.5%.  The expected long-term rate of return on
assets used in determining net periodic pension cost was 7.5%.

     The Company provides an unfunded health care plan to substantially all
retired non-union employees and their dependents.  Eligibility requirements are
based on the individual's age (minimum age of 55), years of service and hire
date.  The benefits are subject to retiree contributions, deductibles, co-
payment provisions and other limitations.

     During the first quarter of 1994, the Company adopted Statement of
Financial Accounting Standard No. 106 (SFAS 106), "Employer's Accounting for
Postretirement Benefits Other Than Pensions." SFAS 106 requires companies to
accrue the expected cost of postretirement health care and life insurance
benefits throughout the employee's active service period.  Previously,
postretirement health care costs were recognized as claims were paid.  The
Company elected to amortize the unfunded Accumulated Postretirement Benefit
Obligation over 20 years.

     The assumed health care average cost trend rate used in measuring the APBO
at March 30, 1995 was 11.0% in 1995 and 3% in 1996 and beyond.  Beginning in
1996, retirees will pay the difference between actual plan costs and the portion
of cost paid by the Company which is limited to a cost trend rate of 3%.  The
assumed discount rate was 7.75%.  A 1% increase in the care cost trend rate
would increase the APBO as of March 30, 1995 by approximately $339,000 and the
sum of the 1995 annual service cost and interest cost by approximately $35,000.




                                        
                                        

     The cost of postretirement health care benefits for the seven months ended

     Prior to 1994, the cost of providing postretirement health care benefits,
net of retiree contributions, was $46,777 in 1993 and $33,396 in 1992.

     The Company has a qualified Profit Sharing Plan in which all salaried
employees and certain hourly paid employees of the Company are eligible to
participate upon completion of six consecutive months of employment.  The Profit
Sharing Plan provides for annual contributions by the Company in an amount
determined by the Board of Directors.  The Plan also permits employees to have
contributions made as 401(k) salary deferrals on their behalf and to make after-
tax voluntary contributions.  The Plan provides that the Company may match
employee contributions as 401(k) salary deferrals.  Company contributions to the
Plan for both profit sharing and matching of employee contributions were
approximately $0.8 million in 1995, $0.5 million in 1994, $1.4 million in 1993
and $1.0 million in 1992.


6.  Stock Incentive Plans


    As a result of the change in control of the Company, the Company paid
out approximately $3.0 million to option holders representing the
difference between the tender offer price of the stock ($15.50 per share)
and the option exercise price.  The amount was included in merger-related
costs in 1995.

    Under the Directors' Stock Option Plan, the Company granted options for
7,500 shares at a price of $13.75 per share in 1995, 7,500 shares at a
price of $15.25 per share in 1994 and 7,500 shares at a price of $19.25 per
share in 1993.  The Directors' Option Plan provides for the granting of
options covering up to 100,000 shares of the Company's common stock,
subject to anti-dilution adjustments.  Options are exercisable at any time
after they are granted, but for not more than ten years after the option's
grant.  As of the period ended 1995,  1994, and 1993, 0, 41,000 and 45,500
options, respectively, were outstanding at a price range of $8.75 to $22.13
per share.

During fiscal 1995, options for a total of 100,000 shares at $10.50 were
granted to certain officers.  The grant was approved at the 1995 Annual
Meeting held in January.

    Under the Company's 1981 Stock Incentive Award Plan, options
outstanding had an exercisable life of either five, six or ten years from
the date of grant.  The Company granted certain officers 15,000 and 16,700
shares of restricted stock in 1992 and 1991, respectively.  There have been
no restricted stock grants since 1992.  The grants of restricted shares
resulted in deferred compensation expense of $699,000 of which $16,000,
$39,000, $132,000 and $185,000 was recognized in 1995, 1994, 1993 and 1992,
respectively.  The unrecognized portion of deferred compensation was $0,
$16,000 and $55,000 as of March 30, 1995, August 31, 1994 and August 31,
1993, respectively.  Under the terms of the grant, the stock does not vest
to the employee until completion of three years of employment after the
date of grant.  The 1981 Stock Incentive Award Plan was terminated by the
Company's Board of Directors on March 30, 1995.

    In 1989, the Board of Directors terminated the 1985 Non-qualified Stock
Option Plan so that no further stock options would be issued under this
plan.  The termination of the plan did not affect the options previously
granted and outstanding.  No option could have been exercised more than ten
years after its grant.

    The following table summarizes the transactions of the 1981 and 1985
Option Plans for 1995, 1994 and 1993.

   included in merger-related costs in 1995.

8.  Income Taxes

     The Company accounts for income taxes in accordance with Statement of
Financial Accounting Standard No. 109, "Accounting for Income Taxes," which was
adopted in 1992.

    The Company does not intend to provide Federal income taxes on the
undistributed earnings for its foreign subsidiaries.  The  Company's policy is
to leave the income in the country of origin until such time as all Federal
income tax due upon its distribution will be fully offset by foreign tax
credits.  As of March 30, 1995, neither foreign subsidiary had undistributed
earnings.

     The Company provides for income taxes at statutory rates based on income
reported for financial statement purposes.  A summary of income tax expense is
shown below (in thousands of dollars):
                               1995    1994    1993    1992

    Federal                 $14,122  $7,059  $7,972  $8,565
    Other tax credits             -     (5)    (10)    (37)

Prepaid and deferred taxes (12,014)   1,664   5,323 (2,130)
                           $  4,692 $10,309 $15,559  $8,899

     The deferred tax assets and liabilities result from timing differences in
the recognition of certain income and expense items for financial and tax
accounting purposes.  The sources of these differences and the related tax
effects were as follows (in thousands of dollars):

                                March 30, 1995                  August 31, 1994

    In the consolidated balance sheets, these deferred assets and deferred
liabilities are classified as deferred tax assets or deferred income tax
liabilities, based on the classification of the related asset or liability for
financial reporting.  A deferred tax liability or asset that is not related to
an asset or liability for financial reporting, including deferred tax assets
related to carryforwards, are classified according to the expected reversal date
of the temporary difference.


     No valuation allowance was recorded in 1995 or 1994.  A valuation allowance
of $1,504,000 was recorded in 1993.

     The Company's effective income tax rates for the period ended March 30,
1995 and August 31, 1994, 1993 and 1992 varied from the statutory federal income
tax rate as set forth in the following table:

Item  9.   Changes  in  and  Disagreements with Accountants  on  Accounting  and
Financial Disclosure.


      A  report  on  Form  8-K was filed on April 26, 1995  reporting  that  the
Company's  Board  of  Directors  appointed Ernst  &  Young  LLP  as  independent

       The   Registrant  had  no  disagreements  on  accounting  and   financial
disclosure of the type referred to in Item 304 of
 Regulation S-K.

     Insofar as indemnification for liabilities arising under the
Securities Act of 1933 may be permitted to directors, officers and
controlling persons of the registrant pursuant to the foregoing provisions,
or otherwise, the registrant has been advised that in the opinion of the
Securities and Exchange Commission such indemnification is against public
policy as expressed in the Securities Act of 1933 and is, therefore,
unenforceable. In the event that a claim for indemnification against such
liabilities (other than the payment by the registrant of expenses incurred
or paid by a director, officer or controlling person of the registrant in
the successful defense of any action, suit or proceeding) is asserted by
such director, officer or controlling person in connection with the
securities being registered, the registrant will, unless in the opinion of
its counsel the matter has been settled by controlling precedent, submit to
a court of appropriate jurisdiction the question whether such
indemnification by it is against public policy as expressed in the Act and
will be governed by the final adjudication of such issue.
