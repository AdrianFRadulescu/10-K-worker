ITEM 1.  BUSINESS
- -----------------

     WorldCorp, Inc., a Delaware corporation ("WorldCorp" or the "Company"), was
organized in March 1987 to serve as the holding company for World Airways, Inc.,
a Delaware corporation ("World Airways"), which was organized in March 1948 and
is the predecessor to the Company.  Currently, WorldCorp operates in two
business areas:  air transportation services and transaction processing.
WorldCorp's air transportation subsidiary, World Airways, was a wholly-owned
subsidiary in 1993.  In February 1994, the Company sold 24.9% of its ownership
to MHS Berhad, a Malaysian aviation company.  World Airways is a leading
worldwide provider of air transportation for commercial and government
customers. In March 1987, WorldCorp acquired Key Airlines, Incorporated, a
Delaware corporation ("KeyAir"), which was subsequently sold on October 23,
1992.  WorldCorp's transaction processing business consists of its ownership
interest in US Order, Inc. ("US Order") and WorldGames.  US Order, a
developmental stage company, has developed a patented order and payment system
("ScanFone(R)") which facilitates the purchase of goods and services from the
home.  In December 1993, US Order completed a $12.0 million private equity
placement.  As a result of this transaction, WorldCorp currently owns 46% of the
voting stock of US Order. WorldCorp has an option through December 15, 1994 to
purchase additional shares of the capital stock of US Order for consideration
equal to $5.0 million which, if exercised, would increase its voting ownership
percentage to 79%.  WorldGames, a wholly-owned subsidiary, is the sole licensee
of ScanFone(R) technology for applications in the gaming industry.  The
principal executive offices of WorldCorp are located at Washington Dulles
International Airport in The Hallmark Building, 13873 Park Center Road, Herndon,
Virginia 22071.  WorldCorp's telephone number is (703) 834-9200.


Airline Operations
- ------------------

     World Airways is a certificated air carrier, operations of which are
limited to the air transportation industry ("Airline Operations").  Airline
Operations accounted for 100% of the Company's operating revenue and operating
income in 1986 through 1991.  In 1992 and 1993, revenue from other business
areas represented less than 1% of the Company's total operating revenues. World
Airways provides supplemental air transportation to major international
airlines, freight forwarders, small package shippers, international vacation
tour operators and the U.S. government.  World Airways' customers purchase the
use of the entire aircraft and then sell either passenger seats or cargo space
directly to their customers.  World Airways' customers assume the risk of
filling the aircraft with passengers or cargo.

     World Airways uses quick-change passenger/cargo convertible aircraft to
target different seasonal peaks throughout the year and to respond rapidly to
demands for supplemental airlift which arise on short notice, such as Operation
Desert Storm.  World Airways' fleet of DC10-30 and MD-11 aircraft appeal to
customers who desire long-range, non-stop, international service.  Some of World
Airways' competitors fly shorter-range aircraft which must make inconvenient and
time-consuming refueling and technical stops.

     World Airways uses specialized operating techniques in pursuit of its
strategic objective to maintain consistently high levels of on-time reliability.
For example, World Airways implements programs that are designed to maintain
World Airways' aircraft to exacting standards, is converting its fleet to new,
state-of-the-art MD-11 aircraft, and extensively trains all flight and technical
personnel and carries maintenance representatives and extensive spare parts kits
on board its aircraft.

     On October 30, 1993, WorldCorp, World Airways, and MHS Berhad ("MHS")
entered into a stock purchase agreement (the "Stock Purchase Agreement")
pursuant to which MHS, subject to satisfactory completion of its due diligence
investigations, agreed to purchase 24.9% of World Airways' common stock.  At the
time of the signing of the Stock Purchase Agreement, World Airways was a wholly
owned subsidiary of WorldCorp.  On February 28, 1994, WorldCorp, World Airways,
and MHS concluded the transaction according to the terms described above.

     MHS recently announced that it will acquire 32% of Malaysian Airline System
Berhad ("MAS"), the flag carrier of Malaysia.  MAS is one of World Airways'
largest commercial customers.

Transaction Processing
- ----------------------

     US Order is a provider of interactive transaction services to the home and
the only company with a screen-based telephone that is fully operational with a
broad menu of available services. Transaction services are currently offered via
screen-based telephones, although the Company expects to offer its bill pay
services via personal computers and touch tone telephones using audio response
units in 1994. Longer term, the Company plans to develop the capability to
support services offered via interactive cable, video games control units, and
personal digital assistants.  Services currently offered by US Order include
bank account inquiry, funds transfer, bill payment, catalog shopping, home
delivery of groceries and restaurant meals, and enhanced telephone services.
The Company generates revenues through the monthly fees charged to customers for
its screen-based telephone ("ScanFone(R)") and transaction services used, as
well as the fees paid to the Company by service providers.

     US Order's Regional Bell Operating Company (RBOC) strategy has evolved from
a joint marketing relationship to a value-added reseller relationship for the
RBOC's enhanced caller services such as Caller ID.  This evolution has taken
place as a result of the RBOC's increased focus on video and cable television
interactivity. In particular the video focus by Bell Atlantic led to the
termination of the Bell Atlantic joint marketing agreement with US Order in
March 1994 as Bell Atlantic consolidated its efforts in the video arena.
Because screen-based telephones greatly improve the ease of use of enhanced
telephone services such as Caller ID, strategic relationships with RBOCs are
developing along this track.

     US Order's product offering to financial institutions have expanded in
1994.  In addition to pursuing joint marketing alliances, US Order will also
provide bill payment services to financial institutions through existing Audio
Response Units, commonly known as touch tone or telephone banking services.  The
company is currently negotiating agreements with several major banks to offer
these services in 1994.

     US Order is also expanding its direct sales of screen-based telephones and
interactive services to consumers.  In October 1993, US Order announced its next
generation screen-based telephone, PhonePlus /TM/, which it expects to have
available to consumers in the third quarter of 1994.  As in the cellular
telephone industry, the price of the telephone will be related to the length and
type of service contract the consumer chooses.

     On February 3, 1992, the US Patent and Trademark Office ("PTO") issued an
order granting a request to reexamine US Order's patent based on a previously
issued patent to a third party. On April 3, 1993, the PTO completed its
reexamination and approved the amended claims of US Order's patent. Other claims
of patent infringement have also been asserted or threatened against US Order.
Although US Order and its counsel believe that US Order has substantial defenses
to any claim of infringement, there can be no assurances that US Order would
prevail in any such proceedings. In addition, upon the occurrence of certain
events such as the bankruptcy of US Order, an investor of the company receives a
fully paid, non exclusive worldwide license to certain of US Order's licensed
technology.

     In December 1993, US Order underwent a private equity placement with
financial and strategic partners.  As a result of this transaction, WorldCorp
owns 46% of the capital stock of US Order.  WorldCorp has an option to purchase
all of the remaining shares of common stock of US Order, which, if exercised,
would increase its ownership percentage to 79%.


Aviation Fuel
- -------------

     The Company's source of aviation fuel is primarily from major oil
companies, under annual delivery contracts, at often frequented commercial
locations, and from United States military organizations at military bases.
More than one supplier is under contract at several locations.  Although the
crisis in the Persian Gulf resulted in substantially higher fuel prices during
the third and fourth quarters of 1990 and the first quarter of 1991, the Company
has experienced no difficulty purchasing fuel during the past three years and
does not expect availability to be a problem in the foreseeable future.  The
availability and price of aviation fuels remains subject to the various
unpredictable economic and market factors that affect the supply of all
petroleum products.

     Most of the air transportation contracts held by World Airways provide for
either customer supplied fuel or a pass-through of fuel price changes.  Although
rapidly escalating fuel costs may cause a decrease in the overall

                                       4
<PAGE>
 
level of activity in the industry, the Company does not anticipate that any
future industry-wide energy problems would have a substantial adverse effect
upon the profitability of Airline Operations.


Seasonality
- -----------

     The contract air carrier transportation business is significantly affected
by seasonal factors.  Typically, Airline Operations experience lower levels of
utilization during the first quarter as demand for passenger and cargo services
are lower relative to other times of the year.  During the first quarter of
1991, the Company experienced unusually high demand due to operations in support
of Operation Desert Storm for the United States Air Mobility Command ("AMC").
Airline Operations generally experience higher levels of utilization in the
second and third quarters due to demand for commercial passenger service
including the annual Hadj pilgrimage.  Fourth quarter utilization generally
depends upon the overall world economic climate, global trade patterns and the
resulting demand for air cargo services.  Airline Operations experienced soft
demand and weak yields in worldwide cargo and passenger markets in the fourth
quarters of 1993, 1992, and 1991.  The quarterly financial data is contained in
Note  19 "Unaudited Quarterly Results" of the Company's Notes to Consolidated
Financial Statements in Item 8.


Customers
- ---------

     Significant customers of WorldCorp's Airline Operations are AMC, MAS, and
P.T. Garuda Indonesia ("Garuda").  The loss of any of these customers or a
substantial reduction in business from any of these sources, if not replaced,
would have a material adverse effect on the Company.

     AMC has awarded contracts to World Airways since 1956. World Airways'
current annual contract with AMC will expire in September 1994.  The minimum
contract amount for 1994 of $20.4 million is a 68% increase over 1993, and will
be augmented by further expansion business.  Expansion business totalled 161% of
the minimum contract amount for 1993 and 53% for 1992.  World Airways cannot
determine how any future cuts in military spending may affect future operations
with AMC.

     World Airways has provided service to MAS since 1981, transporting
passengers for the annual Hadj pilgrimage as well as providing aircraft for
integration into MAS' scheduled passenger and cargo operations. The current MAS
contract, which was entered into in 1992, expires in 1996.  In 1992, the
government of Malaysia instructed the Malaysian Hadj Board (which in turn
instructed MAS) to competitively rebid the contract for the 1993 Hadj. MAS rebid
the contract for the 1993 Hadj and World Airways was again selected to provide
1993 Hadj service to MAS.  World Airways' management believes that its contract
with MAS through 1996 is a legally binding obligation.  MHS Berhad, which
recently acquired 24.9% of World Airways, is in the process of acquiring 32% of
MAS from the Malaysian government.

     World Airways has provided service to Garuda since 1988 under an annual
contract.  World Airways will provide six aircraft for the 1994 Garuda Hadj
operations. In addition, World Airways has provided aircraft for Garuda's cargo
operations.

     The information regarding major customers and foreign revenue is contained
in Note 15 "Segment Information" of the Company's Notes to Consolidated
Financial Statements in Item 8.

     Information concerning classification of products within the air
transportation industry comprising 10% or more of the Company's consolidated
operating revenues is presented in the following table (in millions):

Competition
- -----------

     The Company's Airline Operations compete to varying degrees for commercial
contract revenue with other air carriers and, indirectly, suppliers of surface
transportation.  The Company believes that the basis for competition is price,
availability of scheduled passenger air transportation to a destination, speed
of delivery for cargo, and performance characteristics of aircraft.  In
addition, other competitors could choose to enter contract flight services at
any time, thereby significantly increasing competition.

     The allocation of military air transportation contracts by AMC is based
upon the number and type of aircraft a carrier, alone and/or through joint
venture, makes available to the Civil Reserve Air Fleet ("CRAF").  An increase
by other air carriers in their commitment of aircraft to the CRAF, a reduction
in the number of aircraft controlled by the Company, a reduction of AMC's air
transportation requirements or federal appropriations for such purpose, the
failure to renew joint venture arrangements, or a change in AMC's policy
concerning the method of awarding AMC contracts, among other things, could
adversely affect the amount of AMC contracts, if any, which are awarded in
future years.

     US Order has developed a patented, automated ordering system with
residential and commercial applications.  Residential services include banking,
grocery shopping, telephone services, mail-order catalog shopping, and take-out
food and flower ordering, among others.  US Order's Scanfone(R) system is a
screen-based telephone which is currently the lowest cost means of providing
home shopping and bill paying.  US Order believes that the basis for competition
is price, ease of use of equipment, state-of-the-art equipment, availability of
services, and customer acceptance and satisfaction.  US Order is one of the
first companies to enter this market and believes that this provides a distinct
competitive advantage.  However, other companies are attempting to enter the
home transaction services market using similar types of systems, principally
AT&T, Northern Telecom and Philips.  As demonstrated by the number of potential
competitors, US Order expects competition for this service to increase in the
future.

Regulatory Matters
- ------------------

     All certificated air carriers, including the Company's Airline Operations,
are subject to regulation by the Federal Aviation Administration (the "FAA")
under the Federal Aviation Act of 1958, as amended (collectively the "Federal
Aviation Act"). Generally, the FAA has regulatory jurisdiction over flight
operations, including equipment, personnel, maintenance, and other safety
matters. To assure compliance with its operational standards, the FAA requires
air carriers to obtain operating, airworthiness and other certificates, which
may be suspended or revoked for cause.  The FAA also conducts safety audits and
has the power to impose fines and other sanctions for violations of airline
safety regulations.  Under the Act, the Department of Transportation has
jurisdiction over certain aviation matters such as antitrust concerns (mergers,
acquisitions and unfair competitive practices), accounts and records, and
international routes and fares.  Additionally, foreign governments assert
jurisdiction over air routes and fares to and from the United States, airport
operation rights and facilities access.

     Airline Operations must comply with FAA noise standard regulations
promulgated under the Federal Aviation Act, as amended by the Noise Control Act
of 1972 and the Quiet Communities Act of 1978, and with Environmental Protection
Agency engine emissions regulations promulgated under the Clean Air Act of 1970,
as amended.  In addition, certain of the operations of World Airways are subject
to laws and regulations relating to the disposal of hazardous wastes.

     Certain airport operations have adopted local regulations which, among
other things, impose curfews and noise abatement regulations.

     By virtue of the extensive use of radio and other communications facilities
in its Airline Operations, the Company is also subject to the Federal
Communications Act of 1934, as amended.

     Labor Relations in the air transport industry are generally regulated under
the Federal Railway Labor Act, as amended, which vests certain regulatory powers
in the National Mediation Board with respect to disputes between airlines and
labor unions arising under collective bargaining agreements.  Airlines
certificated prior to October 24, 1978, including the Company's Airline
Operations, are also subject to regulations issued by the Department of Labor
which implements the statutory preferential hiring rights granted by the Airline
Deregulation Act of 1978 to certain airline employees who have been furloughed
or terminated.

                                       6
<PAGE>
 
     The Company's Airline Operations are also subject to regulations of the
Department of Defense whenever flights are conducted for the military, as well
as other regulations which all U.S. corporations experience as a result of doing
business pursuant to state and federal legal requirements.


Employees
- ---------

     At March 24, 1994, the Company and its subsidiaries employed approximately
675 persons. Airline Operations provide various employee benefits customary in
the air transportation industry. Approximately 368, or 54.5%, of the employees

     (1) As of March 24, 1994 the contract has not been amended.

     On June 17, 1987, World Airways and the International Brotherhood of
Teamsters ("Teamsters") executed a five-year agreement on behalf of the World
Airways' cockpit crewmembers, which was ratified on July 30, 1987.  On July 16,
1987, World Airways and the Teamsters executed a five-year agreement on behalf
of the World Airways' flight attendants, which was ratified on August 5, 1987.
Both contracts expired in July 1992 and since that time the cockpit crewmembers
and flight attendants have been employed under the terms of their prior contract
pursuant to the provisions of the Railway Labor Act.  The Company is currently
in active negotiations with the Teamsters concerning renewal of the contracts
for the cockpit crewmembers and flight attendants.  On December 11, 1992, World
Airways and the Teamsters jointly requested the assistance of a federal mediator
to facilitate negotiations between World Airways and its cockpit crewmembers.
The outcome of the negotiations cannot be determined at this time.

     The agreements between World Airways and the Teamsters, on behalf of both
groups, incorporate letters of agreement which require World Airways to give
notice to the Teamsters of any acquisition or merger and would require World
Airways and any successor of World Airways, among other things, to provide
severance pay for employees furloughed within eighteen months of such
acquisition or merger when such furlough results from the merger.  The
agreements also make provision for integration of seniority lists if World
Airways' operations are merged with another air carrier.

     On February 21, 1990, World Airways and the Transport Workers Union
executed a three and one-half year contract on behalf of the World Airways'
Dispatchers, which was ratified on February 27, 1990.  As of March 24, 1994 this
contract has not been amended.

     In March 1992, the Company filed with the Securities and Exchange
Commission ("SEC") a registration statement on Form S-3 registering $60.0 to
$90.0 million of Convertible Subordinated Debentures due 2004 (the
"Debentures"). On May 26, 1992, $65.0 million of the Debentures were issued. The
Debentures are convertible into WorldCorp common stock at $11.06 per share and
bear an annual interest rate of 7%. Semi-annual interest payments are due on May
15 and November 15.

     The Company did not declare any cash dividends in 1993 or 1992 and does not
plan to do so in the foreseeable future.  The Indenture governing the Company's
Debentures and 13 7/8% Subordinated Notes due 1997 in certain circumstances may
restrict the Company from paying dividends or making other distributions on its
common stock.

     The approximate number of shareholders of record at March 24, 1994 is 
2,869.

ITEM 7.  MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS
- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
      OF OPERATIONS
      -------------

  Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of
Operations presented below relates to the operations of WorldCorp, Inc. ("the
Company") as reflected in its consolidated financial statements.  These
statements primarily include the accounts of the contract flight operations of
World Airways, Inc. ("World Airways") and Key Airlines, Incorporated ("KeyAir")
until October 23, 1992 when WorldCorp sold 100% of KeyAir. WorldCorp also has an
ownership interest in US Order, Inc. ("US Order"), a developmental stage
company, which has developed a patented order and payment system ("ScanFone(R)")
which facilitates the purchase of goods and services from the home. On July 1,
1992, the Company increased its ownership to 51%.  In December 1993, US Order
completed a $12.0 million private equity placement.  As a result of this
transaction, WorldCorp currently owns 46% of the voting stock of US Order.
WorldCorp has an option through December 15, 1994, to purchase additional shares
of the capital stock of US Order for consideration equal to $5.0 million, which
if exercised, would increase its voting ownership  percentage to 79%.  US
Order's results of operations are consolidated in the accompanying financial
statements for the period subsequent to July 1, 1992.


GENERAL

  In 1993, WorldCorp operated in two business areas:  air transportation
services and transaction processing.  WorldCorp's air transportation subsidiary,
World Airways, is a leading worldwide provider of air transportation for
commercial and government customers.  WorldCorp's transaction processing
business consists of its 46% ownership of the voting stock of US Order and 100%
ownership of WorldGames.  US Order develops and sells patented, automated
ordering systems with residential and commercial applications.  WorldGames is
the sole licensee of ScanFone(R) technology for applications in the gaming
industry.

  World Airways was a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company in 1993.  In
February 1994, the Company sold 24.9% of its ownership to MHS Berhad, a
Malaysian aviation company (see "Liquidity and Capital Resources").

AIR TRANSPORTATION SERVICES
- ---------------------------

  World Airways is a contract air carrier that charges customers based on a
block hour basis rather than a per seat or per pound basis as do scheduled
passenger carriers or overnight express carriers.  A "block hour" is defined as
the elapsed time computed from the moment the aircraft moves at its point of
origin to the time it comes to rest at its destination.  Fluctuations in flight
revenues are not necessarily indicative of true growth because of shifts in the
mix between full service contracts and basic contracts. Under the terms of full
service contracts, World Airways is responsible for all costs associated with
operating these contracts and receives a higher rate per hour.  Under the terms
of basic contracts, World Airways provides only certain services associated with
the contract including aircraft, crews, insurance, and maintenance.  World
Airways typically charges a lower rate per hour for basic contracts since the
customer is responsible for other operating costs.  For this reason, it is
important to measure pure growth through block hours flown rather than actual
revenues earned.  Typically, U.S. military contracts are full service contracts
where the rate paid is set annually and consists of all flying costs, including
fuel and ground handling of the aircraft and cargo.  World Airways, as a matter
of policy, includes fuel cost adjustment mechanisms in full service contracts,
thus minimizing the risk of fuel price volatility to World Airways.

Customers
- ---------

  World Airways' business relies heavily on its U.S. Air Mobility Command
("AMC"), Malaysian Airline System Berhad ("MAS") and P.T. Garuda Indonesia
("Garuda") contracts, which provided 24%, 17% and 21%, respectively, of
consolidated revenues in 1993, and 19%, 16%, and 16%, respectively, of total
block hours. During 1992, AMC, MAS, and Garuda contracts provided 41%, 24%, and
13%, respectively, of consolidated revenues, and 31%, 29%, and 11%,
respectively, of total block hours.  The loss of any of these contracts or a
substantial reduction in business from any of these contracts, if not replaced,
would have a material adverse effect on the Company's revenues and financial
condition.

  AMC has awarded contracts to World Airways since 1956. World Airways' current
annual contract with AMC will expire in September 1994.  The minimum contract
amount for 1994 of $20.4 million is a 68% increase over

                                       11
<PAGE>
 
1993, and will be augmented by further expansion business.  Expansion business
totalled 161% of the minimum contract amount for 1993 and 53% for 1992.  World
Airways cannot determine how any future cuts in military spending may affect
future operations with AMC.

  World Airways has provided service to MAS since 1981, transporting passengers
for the annual Hadj pilgrimage as well as providing aircraft for integration
into MAS' scheduled passenger and cargo operations. The current MAS contract,
which was entered into in 1992, expires in 1996.  In 1992, the government of
Malaysia instructed the Malaysian Hadj Board (which in turn instructed MAS) to
competitively rebid the contract for the 1993 Hadj. MAS rebid the contract for
the 1993 Hadj and World Airways was again selected to provide 1993 Hadj service
to MAS.  World Airways' management believes that its contract with MAS through
1996 is a legally binding obligation.  MHS Berhad, which recently acquired 24.9%
of World Airways, is in the process of acquiring 32% of MAS from the Malaysian
government.

  World Airways has provided service to Garuda since 1988 under an annual
contract.  World Airways will provide six aircraft for the 1994 Garuda Hadj
operations. In addition, World Airways has provided aircraft for Garuda's cargo
operations.

TRANSACTION PROCESSING SERVICES
- -------------------------------

  US Order is a leading provider of interactive transaction services to the home
and the only company with a screen-based telephone that is fully operational
with a broad menu of available services. Transaction services are currently
offered via screen-based telephones, although the Company expects to offer its
bill pay services via personal computers and touch tone telephones using audio
response units in 1994.  Longer term, the Company plans to develop the
capability to support services offered via interactive cable, video games
control units, and personal digital assistants.  Services currently offered by
US Order include bank account inquiry, funds transfer, bill payment, catalog
shopping, home delivery of groceries and restaurant meals, and enhanced
telephone services.  Future services are expected to encompass a greatly
expanded set of applications.  The Company generates revenues through the
monthly fees charged to customers for its screen-based telephone ("ScanFone(R)")
and transaction services used, as well as the fees paid to the Company by
service providers.


RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

1993 COMPARED WITH 1992
- -----------------------

Operating Revenue
- -----------------

  In 1993, operating revenues increased $2.3 million (1%) to $202.7 million
primarily due to an increase in block hours flown. Block hours increased five
percent to 23,462 in 1993 from 22,263 in 1992.  Due to peak airlift requirements
of World Airways' customers for the 1992 Hadj pilgrimage, certain flights were
subcontracted to other carriers which resulted in $11.5 million of revenue in
1992 with no corresponding block hours flown.  This was not necessary in 1993.
This increase was partially offset by a five percent decrease in revenue per
block hour to $8,589 in 1993 from $8,996 in 1992.  Block hours under full
service contracts were 85% of total block hours in 1993 and 84% in 1992.

  Aircraft capacity, the number of days that the Company's aircraft are
available for service (including days in maintenance), increased to 8.8
available aircraft per day in 1993 from 7.2 in 1992.  This increase was offset
by a 13% decrease in daily aircraft utilization to 7.3 hours from 8.4 hours.
Aircraft utilization is measured by the total block hours that the Company's
aircraft were in use divided by the number of days that the aircraft were
available for service (including days in maintenance).  Included in other
revenues in 1992 is $4.1 million related to settlements of contract claims from
AMC.

Operating Expenses
- ------------------

  Flight costs increased $10.6 million (20%) due to costs associated with the
integration of MD-11 aircraft (see "Capital Plans").  The Company maintained the
maximum number of crews available during the first six months of 1993 in order
to support intensive crewmember training for the MD-11 aircraft while
maintaining the previous year's

                                       12
<PAGE>
 
level of flight operations.  This resulted in higher crew costs than normal
given the low level of utilization during the first quarter of 1993.

  Maintenance costs decreased by $5.8 million (17%) due to lower maintenance
costs for new MD-11 aircraft and lower engine overhaul repair expense for the
DC10-30 fleet.  Maintenance cost per block hour was $1,222 in 1993 compared with
$1,548 in 1992.  The reduced maintenance costs are due, in part, to guarantees
and warranties received from the engine and aircraft manufacturers of the MD-11
aircraft.  Because the MD-11 is a relatively new aircraft, cost experience on
the maintenance of the aircraft is unavailable.  Therefore, the Company is, in
part, relying on manufacturers' guidelines to estimate future maintenance costs
on the MD-11 aircraft.

  Aircraft costs increased by $17.1 million (49%) in 1993.  This increase was
primarily due to a $20.5 million increase in rent cost associated with the
delivery of four MD-11 aircraft during March and April 1993.  In July 1993, two
DC10-30 aircraft were returned to their lessors, resulting in a $1.5 million
early termination payment of which $1.1 million was expensed in 1993.  Partially
offsetting these increases was a reduction of $5.4 million in rent costs
associated with the return of the two DC10 aircraft and short-term aircraft
leases not required in 1993.

  Fuel costs increased by $2.9 million (8%) due to the increase in block hours
flown and a small increase in fuel prices paid per gallon.

  Flight operations subcontracted to other carriers decreased by $10.3 million
(89%).  In 1992, World Airways subcontracted a portion of its AMC contract award
in order to redeploy one of its aircraft for commercial passenger flying.  This
was not necessary in 1993.

  Depreciation and amortization increased $0.4 million (7%) due to the purchase
of spare parts for MD-11 aircraft integrated into the fleet in 1993.

  Selling and administrative costs increased $2.2 million (12%) primarily as a
result of a $0.9 million settlement associated with the return of a DC10-30
aircraft, increased legal fees, and the formation of World Flight Crew Services,
a new subsidiary of WorldCorp.

Loss on Sale of Key Airlines
- ----------------------------

  On October 23, 1992, WorldCorp sold 100% of the outstanding common stock of
KeyAir.  Loss on sale of KeyAir in 1993 primarily consists of the write-off of a
$0.3 million uncollateralized line of credit and $0.3 million drawdown of a
letter of credit.

Transaction Processing-US Order
- -------------------------------

  On July 1, 1992, the Company purchased an incremental 6% of the preferred
stock of US Order for $1.0 million which increased the Company's ownership in US
Order to 51%.  Accordingly, US Order's results of operations are consolidated in
the accompanying financial statements beginning on July 1, 1992.  In December
1993, US Order completed a $12.0 million private equity placement.  Following
this transaction, WorldCorp owns 46% of the voting stock of US Order.  WorldCorp
has an option through December 15, 1994 to purchase additional shares of the
voting stock of US Order for consideration equal to $5.0 million, which would
increase its ownership of the voting stock to 79%.  The accompanying statements
of operations include 59% of the results of operations of US Order beginning
December 1993.  This 59% is based on liquidation preferences.  In 1993, the
Company recorded $9.2 million of losses (net of minority interest) relating to
US Order, compared to $2.4 million of losses in 1992.  This $6.8 million
increase resulted primarily from an increase in overhead costs associated with
expanded research and development and the writedown of an older generation of
terminal components.

Non-Operating Items
- -------------------

  Interest income decreased as a result of lower investment balances and lower
interest rates in 1993.  Interest expense decreased $0.1 million in 1993 as a
result of partially replacing the 13 7/8% Subordinated Notes ("the Notes") with
the 7% convertible debentures (the "Debentures") and lower debt balances.
Offsetting these decreases was interest associated with MD-11 rotables
financing, aircraft rent deferrals, and a bank line of credit.

Operating Revenue
- -----------------

  On October 23, 1992, WorldCorp sold 100% of the outstanding common shares of
its wholly-owned subsidiary, KeyAir, to Savannah Aviation Group ("SAG").
Accordingly, KeyAir's net loss for the period January 1, 1992 through October
23, 1992 is reflected in the accompanying financial statements under the caption
"Loss from operation of Key Airlines".  The Consolidated Statement of Operations
for 1991 has not been reclassified to conform with the 1992 presentation.  The

</TABLE>

     This financial information is presented to facilitate a comparative
analysis of the ongoing operations of the Company and is used as the basis for
Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of
Operations presented below.

     In 1992, revenue decreased $26.3  million (12%) to $200.4  million.  Block
hours decreased 13% from 25,570 in 1991 to 22,263 in 1992.  Due to peak airlift
requirements of World Airways' customers for the 1992 Hadj pilgrimage, certain
flights were subcontracted to other carriers which resulted in $11.5 million of
revenue in 1992 with no corresponding block hours flown.  Excluding this
revenue, operating revenue decreased $36.5 million.  This decrease is due to a
shift from military flying in support of Operation Desert Storm in 1991 to
commercial passenger flying at lower revenue rates in 1992.  Revenue also
decreased as a result of a shift to more basic contracts in 1992.  Full service
block hours represented 84% of total DC10 block hours in 1992 compared with 92%
of DC10 block hours in 1991.  In addition, revenue decreased as a result of
lower block hour rates received for full service contracts in 1992.  Included in
other revenues in 1992 is $4.1 million related to settlements of contract claims
from the AMC.

     World Airways' block hour decrease is primarily due to a decrease in
aircraft utilization.  Aircraft utilization is measured by the total block hours
that the Company's aircraft were in use divided by the number of days that the

                                       14
<PAGE>
 
aircraft were available for service including days in maintenance.  World
Airways' aircraft utilization decreased 13% from 9.6 hours per day in 1991 to
8.4 hours per day in 1992.

     World Airways' DC10 aircraft capacity remained essentially the same in 1992
as compared with 1991.  Aircraft capacity is defined as the number of days that
the Company's aircraft are available for service including days in maintenance.
In 1991, World Airways operated four DC10-10 aircraft under various lease terms
and one DC10-30 aircraft under a short-term lease.  The four DC10-10 aircraft
were returned to their lessors at various times in 1991 and 1992.  These
aircraft were replaced with two DC10-30 passenger aircraft integrated into World
Airways' fleet in April 1992.  Also, two DC10-30 passenger aircraft were
operated under short-term leases beginning in May 1992 to meet peak airlift
requirements of World Airways' customers for the 1992 Hadj pilgrimage.  These
factors combined to create a 1% decrease in DC10 aircraft capacity in 1992.

Operating Expenses
- ------------------

     Flight costs decreased $3.0 million.  This decrease is due to lower
variable costs associated with the 13% decrease in DC10 block hours flown and a
shift to more basic contracts in 1992.

     Maintenance costs decreased $11.0  million.  This decrease is primarily due
to ongoing cost control efforts (specifically, material, component repair costs
and parts rental charges), and the return to their lessors of four DC10-10
aircraft which, historically, have been more costly to maintain.  World Airways
maintenance costs also decreased as a result of the 13% decrease in DC10 block
hours flown.  Total World Airways maintenance expense was $1,548 per block hour
in 1992 compared to $1,779 per block hour in 1991.

     Aircraft costs increased $0.4 million.  DC10 aircraft rent decreased $0.3
million primarily due to the replacement of four DC10-10 and one DC10-30
aircraft with four DC10-30 aircraft.  Aircraft hull insurance increased $0.7
million as a result of increases in insured values due to replacing DC10-10
aircraft with DC10-30 aircraft and increases in insurance rates charged.

     Depreciation expense increased $0.9 million primarily as a result of adding
leasehold improvements and rotables relating to two DC10-30 aircraft integrated
into World Airways' fleet in April 1992.

     Fuel costs decreased $13.9 million as a result of the 13% decrease in DC10
block hours flown and the decrease in fuel costs since the end of the Persian
Gulf War.

     Due to peak airlift requirements of World Airways' customers for the 1992
Hadj pilgrimage, certain other flights were subcontracted to other carriers
which resulted in expenses of $11.6 million.

     Selling and administrative costs decreased $1.4 million primarily due to
the World Airways' Profit Sharing Bonus Plan (the "Plan") expense being included
in flight costs in 1992 and included in selling and administrative costs in
1991.  Through 1991, payments under the Plan were first made to individuals who
were entitled to repayment of wage concessions from December 1, 1982 through
January 31, 1985.  With the payment of the 1991 Plan expense amount, all wage
concession amounts have been repaid.  Beginning in 1992, amounts expensed
pursuant to the Plan are for profit sharing and are paid to current employees,
primarily crewmembers.

Loss (Income) From Operation of Key Airlines
- --------------------------------------------

     Operating results of Key Airlines decreased to a loss of $6.0 million in
1992 from income of $0.2 million in 1991.  This is partially due to ten months
of activity in 1992 compared with twelve months of activity in 1991.  This $6.2
million decrease is primarily attributable to a 10% decrease in block hours
flown combined with a 20% decrease in revenue yield per block hour.  KeyAir's
revenue decreased $15.0 million in 1992.  In 1991, KeyAir's customers consisted
of tour operators and the U.S. military which typically guaranteed payment for
blocks of seats or for the full aircraft on a point-to-point basis.  In 1992,
KeyAir operated its Caribbean Connection service based on a hub and spoke system
and sold tickets to individual passengers directly, through travel agencies, or
through tour operators.  As a result, in 1992, KeyAir experienced an overall
increase in expenses directly attributable to this new type of flying.  For
example, expenses associated with KeyAir's headquarters in Savannah, Georgia
increased, and advertising expense, credit card and bank fees, travel agent
commissions, and reservations systems costs all increased in 1992 or were not
incurred in 1991.

                                       15
<PAGE>
 
Loss on Sale of Key Airlines
- ----------------------------

     Loss on sale of Key Airlines consists principally of the non-cash write-
down of the B727 aircraft and related rotables to estimated net realizable
values and the write-off of the remaining goodwill associated with the purchase
of KeyAir in 1987.

Transaction Processing - US Order
- ---------------------------------

     On July 1, 1992, the Company purchased an incremental 6% of the preferred
stock of US Order, a transaction processing company, for $1.0 million which
increased the Company's ownership in US Order to 51%.  Accordingly, US Order's
results of operations are consolidated in the accompanying financial statements
for the period subsequent to July 1, 1992.  For the six months ended December
31, 1992, US Order incurred operating costs of $4.0 million. To date, US Order
has generated limited revenue through the rental of ScanFones(R) and transaction
processing fees.

Non-Operating Items
- -------------------

     Interest expense decreased primarily as a result of the redemption of $48.8
million of 13 7/8% Subordinated Notes (the "Notes") partially offset by the
issuance of $65.0 million of 7% Convertible Debentures (the "Debentures") in May
1992.  Interest expense also decreased as a result of the settlement, in January
1992, of World Airways' litigation with the State of California Franchise Tax
Board, decreases in variable interest rates, the payoff of World Airways' short-
term line of credit for most of the year, and the paydown of B727-100 aircraft
debt.  Interest income decreased as a result of lower investment balances held
in 1992 and lower interest rates.  In 1992, the gain on investments consists
primarily of a $1.1 million gain on sales of bonds and the termination of an
interest rate swap agreement, reduced by a $0.9 million loss from WorldCorp's
equity investment in US Order.  During the first six months of 1992, WorldCorp's
investment in US Order was recorded using the equity method of accounting.
Accordingly, WorldCorp's share of US Order's losses were recorded as a loss on
investments.  In 1991, loss on investments primarily result from the sale of
high-yield securities held in the Company's investment portfolio.  In 1992,
$48.8 million of the face value of the Notes were repurchased at a loss of $3.3
million.  In 1991, $10.3 million of the Notes were repurchased at an average of
60% of face value resulting in a gain of $3.5 million.

     During the fourth quarter of 1991, World Airways settled litigation with
the State of California Franchise Tax Board (the "Board") concerning assessments
of deficiencies in state franchise taxes for the years 1973-75 and 1978.  The
Board had asserted a total tax deficiency of approximately $2.4 million and
accrued interest of approximately $5.9 million.  World Airways settled this case
with the Board and reversed a previously recorded liability which resulted in a
non-operating gain of $5.5 million, net of legal expenses.


LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES

     The Company's air transportation subsidiary operates in a very challenging
business environment.  The combination of a generally weak economy, reduced
military spending, and the depressed state of the airline industry and the
economy has adversely affected the Company's operating performance.  The Company
is highly leveraged primarily due to losses sustained by World Airways'
scheduled operations between 1979 and 1986, debt restructurings in 1984 and
1987, and losses the Company incurred in 1990, 1992, and 1993.  The Company has
historically financed its working capital and capital expenditure requirements
out of cash flow from operating activities, secured borrowings, and other
financings from banks and other lenders.

Cash Flows from Operating Activities
- ------------------------------------

     During 1993, operating activities used $8.6 million compared to $17.5
million in the prior year. Excluding the non-cash loss on the sale of KeyAir in
1992, losses in 1993 were $14.2 million higher than 1992. The increased losses
were offset by the deferral of certain aircraft rental payments, an increase in
accounts payable and a decrease in accounts receivable. Accounts receivable
decreased due to lower levels of military flying in the fourth quarter of 1993.

                                       16
<PAGE>
 
Cash Flows from Investing Activities
- ------------------------------------

     Cash flows from investing activities used $14.6 million in 1993 as compared
to $4.4 million in 1992 resulting primarily from the purchase of spare parts for
the MD-11 aircraft in 1993, partially offset by proceeds received from the
disposal of DC10 and B727 rotable spare parts.

Cash Flows from Financing Activities
- ------------------------------------

     In 1993, financing activities provided $26.4 million compared to providing
$12.9 million in the prior year.  In 1992, the Company received $62.9 million
from the sale of the Debentures and used $47.1 million of these proceeds to
repurchase the 13 7/8% Notes.  In 1993, the Company financed $19.1 million of
spare parts related to the integration of the MD-11 aircraft, and entered into a
$20.0 million credit facility.  The Company made debt payments of approximately
$28.7 million in 1993 compared to $10.3 million in 1992.  This $18.4 million
increase primarily relates to the repayment of the Company's two bank lines of
credit. The US Order private placement (see "Financing Developments") and the
exercise of options and warrants of the Company provided $8.4 million in 1993.

Capital Plans
- -------------

     World Airways plans to exit higher cost DC10 aircraft and ultimately
standardize its fleet around the MD-11 aircraft.  In October 1992 and January
1993, World Airways signed a series of agreements to lease seven new MD-11
aircraft for initial lease terms of two to five years.  As of March 25, 1994,
World Airways has taken delivery of four passenger MD-11 aircraft and is
scheduled to take delivery of one freighter MD-11 in April 1994, and two
convertible MD-11s in 1995.  Two of the passenger MD-11 aircraft replaced the
two passenger DC10-30 aircraft which were integrated into World Airways' fleet
in April 1992 and returned to McDonnell Douglas in July 1993. The delivery of
the convertible MD-11s is expected to occur approximately six months after the
end of the lease in 1994 of three DC10-30 convertibles.

      World Airways made $20.7 million of capital expenditures and cash deposits
for MD-11 integration in 1993, of which $19.1 was financed.  World Airways
estimates that its required capital expenditures for MD-11 integration will be
approximately $7.3 million in 1994 and $9.8 million in 1995.  As of December 31,
1993, the Company holds approximately $14.7 million of aircraft spare parts and
transaction processing terminals currently available for sale.  The Company
anticipates proceeds from the sale of these assets to be approximately $7.5
million in 1994.

     US Order's working capital and capital expenditure requirements for 1994
are expected to be approximately $8.0 million.  As of December 31, 1993,
WorldCorp had invested $18.1 million of funds in US Order.  US Order is
currently seeking a private equity placement for up to $8.0 million with
financial and strategic partners. However, there can be no assurance that such
financing will be obtained.  WorldCorp does not plan to provide additional
financing to US Order in 1994.

     On December 7, 1993, World Airways entered into a $20.0 million revolving
line of credit borrowing arrangement.  This credit facility is collateralized by
aircraft spare parts and certain receivables.  $4.4 million of these proceeds
were used to repay the outstanding balance on the $5.0 million revolving line of
credit borrowing arrangement which expired in 1993.

Financing Developments
- ----------------------

     In its most recent Form 10-Q filing, the Company stated management would
take several steps to add to its cash reserves. As of this date, the Company has
closed certain transactions and executed agreements covering other transactions
which, in aggregate, have significantly increased the cash reserves of
WorldCorp, World Airways, and US Order.

     First, on October 30, 1993, WorldCorp, Inc., World Airways, Inc., and MHS
Berhad entered into a Stock Purchase Agreement (the "Stock Purchase Agreement")
pursuant to which MHS, subject to satisfactory completion of its due diligence
investigations, agreed to purchase 24.9% of World Airways' common stock for
$27.4 million in cash.  Under this Agreement, World Airways would receive upon
closing (the "Closing") $12.4 million to fund its working capital requirements.
The remaining $15.0 million (less a $2.7 million deposit received in December

                                       17
<PAGE>
 
1993) would be paid to WorldCorp to add to its cash reserves.  At the time of
the signing of the Stock Purchase Agreement, World Airways was a wholly-owned
subsidiary of WorldCorp.  On February 28, 1994, WorldCorp, World Airways, and
MHS concluded the transaction according to the terms described above.  As a
result of this transaction, WorldCorp will recognize a gain of approximately
$27.0 million in the first quarter of 1994.

     Second, World Airways finalized an agreement with a financial institution
for a $20.0 million credit facility collateralized by certain receivables and
spare parts.  This agreement contains certain covenants related to World
Airways' financial condition and operating results.  Approximately $10.8 million
of the proceeds from this transaction were used to retire existing obligations.
The balance was added to cash reserves. As of March 24, 1994, $0.8 million of
the $8.0 million portion of the credit facility collateralized by receivables
was utilized.

     Third, on November 8, 1993, World Airways completed negotiations for $14.7
million of lease payment deferrals and related financings for eight of its nine
aircraft in 1993.  The ninth aircraft was returned to the lessor in October
1993.  Additionally, World Airways received a permanent reduction in the lease
rate for one DC10 aircraft, the only DC10 that will remain on long-term lease
after September 1994.  In 1993, $6.6 million of the deferrals were repaid.  The
remaining deferrals are scheduled to be repaid beginning in the second quarter
of 1994, and bear interest at rates ranging from 7% to 12%.

     Fourth, in December 1993, US Order completed a private equity placement
with financial and strategic partners for $12.0 million, of which WorldCorp
invested $1.7 million.  As a result of this transaction, WorldCorp owns 46% of
the voting stock of US Order.  WorldCorp has an option through December 15,
1994, to purchase additional shares of capital stock of US Order for
consideration equal to $5.0 million, which if exercised, would increase its
ownership percentage of the voting stock to 79%.  US Order is currently seeking
a private equity placement for up to $8.0 million with other financial and
strategic partners.

     Fifth, in October and November 1993, the Company received $2.6 million of
new equity investment through a series of warrant exercises by Ganz Capital
Management.

     Finally, WorldCorp is seeking to place privately two securities of US Order
that it currently holds:  a $3.5 million increasing rate note with warrants in
US Order, and $7.5 million of non-convertible preferred stock with warrants in
US Order.  No assurances can be made that the Company will be successful in
placing these securities.

     The Company believes that the combination of the financings consummated to
date and the operating and additional financing plans described above will be
sufficient to allow the Company to meet its operating and capital requirements
during 1994.


BUSINESS TRENDS

     The Company is highly leveraged primarily due to losses sustained by World
Airways' scheduled operations between 1979 and 1986, debt restructurings in 1984
and 1987 and losses the Company incurred in 1990, 1992, and 1993.  In addition,
the Company incurred substantial debt and operating lease commitments during
1993 in connection with acquiring MD-11 aircraft and related spare parts. As a
result, in the second half of 1993, the Company took several steps to improve
its liquidity, including: negotiating rent deferrals on eight aircraft and the
early return to the lessor of another aircraft, arranging a $20.0 million
accounts receivable and aircraft parts financing, and consummating the sale of
24.9% of World Airways.

     The Company's air transportation business is highly seasonal.  Typically,
World Airways experiences reduced demand during the first quarter for passenger
and cargo services relative to other times of the year.  World Airways generally
experiences stronger results in the second and third quarters due to demand for
commercial passenger services including the annual Hadj pilgrimage.  Fourth
quarter results depend upon the overall world economic climate and global trade
patterns.

     Since the end of the Persian Gulf War, soft demand and weakening yields
have adversely effected worldwide cargo and passenger markets. In management's
view, block hours flown are a critical indicator of the airline's profitability.
In order for World Airways to achieve positive operating results and meet its
requirements under certain financing agreements, it will be necessary to
increase block hours flown from 1993 levels. In response, World

Airways has significantly increased its worldwide sales and marketing presence
by 1) selling 24.9% of its equity to MHS Berhad solidifying a marketing alliance
with a leading aviation company in Malaysia, 2) recruiting three active outside
board members with experience in worldwide aviation and travel services, and 3)
increasing its internal sales and marketing staff from two to seven executives.
These actions were taken with the objective of increasing World Airways' flying
levels. The fourth quarter of 1993 was the first recent quarter where flying
level trends turned positive, increasing by 40% over the prior year's fourth
quarter.  Also, in the first quarter of 1994, management expects flying levels
to be up more than 20% compared to 1993 levels.  Management believes that
positive trends will continue for the second and third quarters.  Fourth quarter
1994 flying levels will largely depend upon global trade demand for cargo and
the placement of at least two MD-11 passenger aircraft under longer-term
contracts.

     On February 28, 1994, WorldCorp, World Airways, and MHS concluded the 24.9%
sale of World Airways' common stock for $27.4 million in cash.  WorldCorp will
recognize a gain of approximately $27.0 million from this transaction in the
first quarter of 1994.  The Company has an objective to replicate a similar
investment with strategic partners in Latin America.

     US Order is a provider of interactive transaction processing services to
the home and the only company with a screen-based telephone that is fully
operational with a broad menu of available services.  US Order, however, is a
development stage company and expects to continue to incur losses in 1994 and
has significant working capital and capital expenditure requirements for 1994
(see "Liquidity and Capital Resources" and "Capital Plans").

     US Order's Regional Bell Operating Company (RBOC) strategy has evolved from
a joint marketing relationship to a value-added reseller relationship for the
RBOC's enhanced caller services such as Caller ID.  This evolution has taken
place as a result of the RBOC's increased focus on video and cable television
interactivity. In particular the video focus by Bell Atlantic led to the
termination of the Bell Atlantic joint marketing agreement with US Order in
March 1994 as Bell Atlantic consolidated its efforts in the video arena.
Because screen-based telephones greatly improve the ease of use of enhanced
telephone services such as Caller ID, strategic relationships with RBOCs are
developing along this track.

     US Order's product offering to financial institutions have expanded in
1994.  In addition to pursuing joint marketing alliances, US Order will also
provide bill payment services to financial institutions through existing Audio
Response Units, commonly known as touch tone or telephone banking services.  The
company is currently negotiating agreements with several major banks to offer
these services in 1994.  Later in 1994, US Order expects to offer similar "back
end" bill payment support via personal computers.

     US Order is also significantly expanding its direct sales of screen-based
telephones and interactive services to consumers.  In October 1993, US Order
announced its next generation screen-based telephone, PhonePlus /TM/, which it
expects to have available to consumers in the third quarter of 1994.  As in the
cellular telephone industry, the price of the telephone will be related to the
length and type of service contract the consumer chooses.


OTHER MATTERS

     On August 11, 1992, WorldCorp, World Airways, and certain other commercial
paper customers of Washington Bancorporation ("WBC") were served with a
complaint by WBC as debtor-in-possession by and through the Committee of
Unsecured Creditors of WBC (the "Committee").  The complaint arises from
investment proceeds totaling $6.8 million received by WorldCorp and World
Airways from WBC in May 1990 in connection with the maturity of WBC commercial
paper.  The Committee seeks to recover this amount on the grounds that these
payments constituted voidable preferences and/or fraudulent conveyances under
the Federal Bankruptcy Code and under applicable state law.  On June 9, 1993,
the Company filed a motion to dismiss this litigation and intends to vigorously
contest the claim.  No assurances can be given of the eventual outcome of this
litigation.

     World Airways' cockpit and flight attendant crewmembers are covered by
collective bargaining agreements which expired in July 1992.  World Airways is
currently in negotiations with the International Brotherhood of Teamsters
("Teamsters") to develop new agreements for cockpit and flight attendant
crewmembers.  World Airways and the Teamsters jointly requested the assistance
of a federal mediator to facilitate negotiations between World Airways and its
cockpit crewmembers.  The outcome of the negotiations cannot be determined at
this time.

     WorldCorp has never paid any cash dividends and does not plan to do so in
the foreseeable future.  Both the 13 7/8% Subordinated Notes Indenture and the
indenture pursuant to which the Debentures were issued (the "Indentures")
restrict the Company's ability to pay dividends or make other distributions on
its common stock. In addition, the Indentures originally restricted the ability
of World Airways to pay dividends other than to the Company. In 1994, however,
the Company received approval from the holders of the Indentures to allow World
Airways to pay dividends to parties other than the Company.

     The $20 million credit facility also contains restrictions on World
Airways' ability to pay dividends.  Under this agreement, World Airways cannot
declare, pay, or make any dividend or distribution in excess of the lesser of
$4.5 million or 50% of net income for the previous six months.  In addition,
World Airways must have a cash balance of at least $7.5 million immediately
after giving effect to such dividend.

     All of the funds from operations are generated by the Company's
subsidiaries.  The ability of the Company and its subsidiaries to pay principal
and interest on their respective short and long-term obligations is
substantially dependent upon the payment to the Company of dividends, interest
or other charges by its subsidiaries and upon funds generated by the operations
of the subsidiaries.

     As of December 31, 1993, the Company had net operating loss carryforwards,
investment tax credit carryforwards, and alternative minimum tax credit
carryforwards of $137.2 million, $9.6 million, and $2.2 million, respectively
(the "Carryforwards").  The availability of net operating loss and tax credit
carryforwards to reduce the Company's future federal income tax liability is
subject to limitations under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the
"Code").  Generally, these limitations restrict availability of net operating
loss and tax credit carryforwards upon an ownership change.  In August 1991, the
Company experienced an ownership change, and the use of $72.6 million of net
operating loss carryforwards available to the Company from losses generated
prior to the ownership change, plus the tax credit carryforwards described
above, are limited to approximately $6.3 million annually (the "Limitation").
As a result of the transaction with MHS in February 1994, however, the
Carryforwards will be split into two components:  those generated solely by
World Airways, and those generated by the remaining entities of the controlled
group.  As a result, approximately $84.8 million of the consolidated net
operating loss carryforward will no longer be available to offset federal
taxable income reflected on future consolidated tax returns.  Instead, the $84.8
million will be available to World Airways on a separate company basis (subject
to the Limitation).  World Airways will also retain sole use of the $9.6 million
investment tax credit carryforward and the $2.2 million alternative minimum tax
credit carryforward to reduce its future federal income tax liability, subject
to limitations under the Code.

                        WORLDCORP, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES
                   NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS


1.  SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES

A.  Principles of Consolidation

  The accompanying consolidated financial statements include the accounts of
WorldCorp, Inc. ("WorldCorp" or the "Company"), its wholly-owned subsidiaries:
World Airways, Inc., ("World Airways") (see Note 18);  Key Airlines,
Incorporated ("KeyAir") (see Note 3);  WorldCorp Leasing, Inc.;  WorldCorp
Leasing II, Inc.;  WorldCorp Services, Inc.;  World Airways Cargo, Inc.;
WorldCorp Investments, Inc.; World Flight Crew Services, Inc.; and a 46%
ownership interest in the voting stock in US Order, Inc. ("US Order").  All
significant intercompany balances have been eliminated.

B.  Financial Statement Reclassifications
  Certain items in prior year financial statements included herein have been
reclassified to conform to 1993 financial statement presentation.

C.  Cash Equivalents

  For purposes of the Statements of Cash Flows, the Company considers all highly
liquid investments purchased with an original maturity of ninety days or less to
be cash equivalents.

D.  Revenue Recognition
  Contract flight operations and transaction processing revenues are recognized
as the services are provided.

E.  Net Earnings (Loss) Per Common Share

  Primary earnings (loss) per common share have been computed by dividing
earnings (loss) by the weighted average number of common and common equivalent
shares outstanding.  Common equivalent shares include warrants and options.
Fully diluted earnings per common and common equivalent shares including
convertible debt, have not been presented where the results are anti-dilutive.

F.  Investments
  Short-term investments are carried at the lower of aggregate cost or market
value.

  Interest to be paid or received on notional principal amounts associated with
interest rate swap agreements are measured as interest rates change and are
recorded ratably over the life of the agreement.

G.  Equipment and Property

  Equipment and property are stated at cost or if acquired under capital leases,
at the present value of the minimum lease payments.  Engine overhauls and major
airframe maintenance and repairs are charged to operating expense on an accrual
basis.  Modifications performed in response to Airworthiness Directives issued
by the Federal Aviation Administration are capitalized at cost.

  Provisions for depreciation and amortization of equipment and property are
computed over estimated useful lives by the straight-line method, with estimated
residual values of 0 - 15%.  Estimated useful lives of equipment and property
are as follows:

     DC10 and MD11 flight equipment             15-16 years
     Other equipment and property                3-10 years

H.  Assets Held for Sale
  Assets held for sale are recorded at the lower of cost or estimated net
realizable value.

I.  Intangible Assets

  The excess cost of the Company's investment in US Order over the fair value of
the Company's share of US Order's net assets at the date of acquisition is being
amortized over 17 years using the straight-line method.

J.  Income Taxes

  In February 1992, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued Statement of
Financial Accounting Standards No. 109, "Accounting for Income Taxes," ("FAS
#109").  Under the asset and liability method of FAS #109, deferred tax assets
and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to
differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets
and liabilities and their respective tax bases.  Deferred tax assets and
liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable
income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be
recovered or settled.  Under FAS #109, the effect on deferred tax assets and
liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that
includes the enactment date.

  Effective January 1, 1992, the Company adopted FAS #109 which did not result
in any cumulative adjustment to the accompanying consolidated financial
statements.

K.  Postretirement Benefits Other Than Pensions

  World Airways' cockpit crewmembers and eligible dependents are covered under
postretirement health care benefits to age 65.  Effective January 1, 1992, World
Airways adopted Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 106,
"Employers' Accounting for Postretirement Benefits Other Than Pensions" ("FAS
#106").  The Company elected to immediately recognize the cumulative effect of
the change in accounting for postretirement benefits of $2.0 million.  The
Company funds the benefit costs on a pay-as-you-go (cash) basis.

L.  Transactions in Subsidiaries' Stock
  Gains or losses realized in connection with the sale of stock by a subsidiary
are recognized in income by the Company.

2.  OPERATING ENVIRONMENT

  The Company is highly leveraged primarily due to losses sustained by World
Airways' scheduled operations between 1979 and 1986, debt restructurings in 1984
and 1987 and losses the Company incurred in 1990, 1992, and 1993.  In addition,
the Company incurred substantial debt and operating lease commitments during
1993 in connection with acquiring MD-11 aircraft and related spare parts. As a
result, in the second half of 1993, the Company took several steps to improve
its liquidity, including: negotiating rent deferrals on eight aircraft and the
early return to the lessor of another aircraft, arranging a $20.0 million
accounts receivable and aircraft parts financing, and consummating the sale of
24.9% of World Airways.

  The Company's air transportation business is highly seasonal.  Typically,
World Airways experiences reduced demand during the first quarter for passenger
and cargo services relative to other times of the year.  World Airways generally
experiences stronger results in the second and third quarters due to demand for
commercial passenger services including the annual Hadj pilgrimage.  Fourth
quarter results depend upon the overall world economic climate and global trade
patterns.

  Since the end of the Persian Gulf War, soft demand and weakening yields have
adversely effected worldwide cargo and passenger markets. In management's view,
block hours flown are a critical indicator of the airline's profitability.  In
order for World Airways to achieve positive operating results and meet its
requirements under certain financing agreements, it will be necessary to
increase block hours flown from 1993 levels. In response, World Airways has
significantly increased its worldwide sales and marketing presence by 1) selling
24.9% of its equity to MHS Berhad solidifying a marketing alliance with a
leading aviation company in Malaysia, 2) recruiting three active outside board
members with experience in worldwide aviation and travel services, and 3)
increasing its internal sales and marketing staff from two to seven executives.
These actions were taken with the objective of increasing World Airways' flying
levels. The fourth quarter of 1993 was the first recent quarter where flying
level trends turned positive, increasing by 40% over the prior year's fourth
quarter.  Also, in the first quarter of 1994, management expects flying levels
to be up more than 20% compared to 1993 levels.  Management believes that
positive trends will continue for the second and third quarters.  Fourth quarter
1994 flying levels will largely depend upon global trade demand for cargo and
the placement of at least two MD-11 passenger aircraft under longer-term
contracts.

  The Company's investment in its US Order subsidiary has also required
substantial support by WorldCorp in recent years.  The Company's share of US
Order losses in 1993 approximated $9.2 million.  US Order, a development stage
company, expects to continue to incur losses in 1994.  In December 1993, US
Order completed a private equity financing (see Note 16 for additional
information) and is currently seeking additional equity

                                       28
<PAGE>
 
financing.  However, there can be no assurance that such financing will be
obtained.  WorldCorp does not plan to provide additional financing to US Order
in 1994.

  The Company believes that the combination of the financings consummated to
date and the operating and additional financing plans described above will be
sufficient to allow the Company to meet its operating and capital requirements
during 1994.

3.  SALE OF KEY AIRLINES

  In September 1992, WorldCorp decided to dispose of its wholly-owned
subsidiary, KeyAir and on October 6, 1992, WorldCorp entered into a letter of
intent to sell the stock of KeyAir to Savannah Aviation Group ("SAG").  The sale
of KeyAir was completed on October 23, 1992. Accordingly, KeyAir's net loss for
1992 is reflected in the accompanying financial statements, under the caption
"Loss from operation of Key Airlines".  Included in "Loss from operation of Key
Airlines" in 1992 is $40.7 million of KeyAir operating revenues and $46.7
million of KeyAir operating expenses. The 1991 financial statements were not
reclassified to conform with the 1992 presentation.

Under the terms of the stock purchase agreement, WorldCorp sold all of the
outstanding common shares of KeyAir for $6.5 million.  As consideration for the
shares, WorldCorp accepted a $3.5 million Senior Secured Note (the "Note") and a
$3.0 million Convertible Subordinated Debenture (the "Debenture") from SAG,
which were not recorded by the Company due to uncertainty regarding realization
of these amounts.  WorldCorp recorded an estimated loss on the sale of KeyAir of
$31.4 million in the accompanying financial statements as of December 31, 1992.
Loss on sale of KeyAir in 1992 consisted primarily of a writedown of the B727
aircraft and related rotables to estimated net realizable values and a write-off
of the remaining goodwill associated with the purchase of KeyAir in 1987.  As a
result of the sale of KeyAir and the Company's inability to deploy the aircraft
in other long-term opportunities beyond 1992, the Company discontinued operating
the B727-100 aircraft after December 31, 1992.  The Company entered into a
consignment agreement with a third party to dismantle and sell certain of the
B727-100 aircraft and the related rotables beginning in November 1992.  As a
result, in 1992, the Company reduced the carrying values of the B727 aircraft to
estimated net realizable values and classified these amounts as assets held for
sale in the accompanying balance sheet (see Note 7).

  On February 8, 1993, KeyAir filed a voluntary petition for bankruptcy
protection under Chapter 11 and certain disputes arose between the Company and
the purchasers of KeyAir.  During 1993, in connection with the settlement of
these disputes, the Company relinquished all rights to collection of the Notes
and the Debentures. The Company recorded a loss of approximately $0.8 million in
1993 related to amounts outstanding under a line of credit and certain letters
of credit related to KeyAir which will not be recovered by the Company.

credit and $4.3 million received in the form of forgiveness of various
liabilities of US Order.  Additionally, during 1993, US Order entered into $1.7
million of capital leases and other long-term obligations in connection with the
purchase of transaction processing equipment.

  Debt issuance costs consist of the costs of issuing the 13 7/8% Subordinated
Notes due 1997, the Convertible Subordinated Debentures due 2004, and revolving
lines of credit agreements.  These costs are being amortized over the term of
the respective debt instruments using the effective interest method (see Note 9
and 10).

7.   ASSETS HELD FOR SALE

  Assets held for sale consist primarily of DC10 and B727 rotables with a net
book value of $8.9 million and two DC10 engines with a net book value of $4.5
million.  The Company has consigned these parts with a third party to sell these
parts over a reasonable period of time with the objective of maximizing the
proceeds from sale.  During 1993, US Order recorded a $1.8 million writedown
associated with its older generation of terminal components, a portion of which
are available for sale.

8.  EQUIPMENT AND PROPERTY

  World Airways was awarded an insurance settlement which resulted in a $1.1
million reduction in maintenance expenses in 1991 for repairs associated with an
aircraft that was damaged in a volcanic eruption.

  On May 1, 1991, World Airways sold a DC10-30 engine for $3.2 million and
leased the engine back under a 60 month operating lease.

  On December 29, 1989, World Airways purchased a McDonnell Douglas DC10-30CF
series aircraft (the "Aircraft") from Potomac Capital Investment Corporation,
for approximately $42.0 million.  The Aircraft had been involved in a sale
leaseback transaction with Burnham Leasing Incorporated in 1987,  and was in the
World Airways fleet under an operating lease which was terminated at the time of
the purchase. Upon purchase of the Aircraft, World Airways reduced the carrying
value of the Aircraft and, correspondingly, the deferred gain from the 1987 sale
by $5.0 million.  On January 15, 1991, World Airways sold the Aircraft for $47.5
million, retired $38.1 million in related debt, and leased the Aircraft back
under a twelve year operating lease.  The resulting gain on sale of $12.1
million is being amortized over the lease period.

9.  NOTE PAYABLE TO BANK

  In 1993, World Airways entered into an $8.0 million revolving line of credit
borrowing arrangement which is collateralized by certain receivables which were
sold to the bank with recourse. Borrowing availability under the line is based
on the amount of eligible receivables.  Borrowings under the line of credit were
$7.1 million at December 31, 1993 and bear interest at the greater of the
federal funds rate plus 2.5% or the prime rate plus 2%. At December 31, 1993,
the interest rate was 8%. World Airways is required to pay any outstanding
amounts under the line of credit by January 7, 1996, with the option to extend
for one year. This agreement contains certain covenents related to World
Airways' financial condition and operating results, including minimum quarterly
net income tests. In addition, there is an unused facility fee of 0.5% per year
(see Note 10).

  The Company had a $10.0 million revolving line of credit borrowing
arrangement, collateralized by certain receivables, available during 1992.
Approximately $9.8 million was available under this credit facility at December
31, 1992 based upon the amount of outstanding receivables.  Borrowings under the
line of credit were $9.3 million at December 31, 1992 and bear interest at the
lesser of the LIBOR rate plus 2.75% per annum or the lender's prime rate plus
0.5% per annum.  At December 31, 1992 the interest rate was 6.5%.  The line of
credit was paid in full on December 7, 1993 and expired at the end of the year.

  The Indenture pursuant to which the 13 7/8% Subordinated Notes (the
"Indenture") were issued may restrict the Company's ability to pay dividends on
its common stock.  Under the Indenture, the Notes are redeemable beginning
August 15, 1992, at which time they are redeemable at 104% of par value and at
rates declining thereafter.

  In May 1992, the Company issued $65.0 million of Convertible Subordinated
Debentures due 2004 (the "Debentures").  The Debentures are convertible into
WorldCorp common stock at $11.06 per share, subject to adjustment in certain
events, and bear an annual interest rate of 7%.  Semi-annual interest payments
are due on May 15 and November 15.  During the second and third quarters of
1992, the Company used $47.1 million of the proceeds from this borrowing to
retire a portion of its 13 7/8% Subordinated Notes due 1997 (the "Notes").

  WorldCorp has never paid any cash dividends and does not plan to do so in the
foreseeable future.  Both the 13 7/8% Subordinated Notes Indenture and the
indenture pursuant to which the Debentures were issued (the "Indentures")
restrict the Company's ability to pay dividends or make other distributions on
its common stock. In addition, the Indentures originally restricted the ability
of World Airways to pay dividends other than to the Company. In 1994, however,
the Company received approval from the holders of the Indentures to allow World
Airways to pay dividends to parties other than the Company.

  The aircraft parts security agreement is subject to the terms of the $8.0
million revolving line of credit borrowing (see Note 9).  Under this agreement
the borrowing must be reduced by the amount of proceeds received from the sale
of excess DC10 and B727 spare parts, but at a minimum of $0.5 million each
month.  The borrowing facility also restricts World Airways' ability to pay
dividends.  Under this agreement, World Airways cannot declare, pay, or make any
dividend or distribution in excess of the lesser of $4.5 million or 50% of net
income for the previous six months.  In addition, World Airways must have a cash
balance of at least $7.5 million immediately after giving effect to such
dividend.

  The following table shows the aggregate amount of scheduled principal
maturities (in thousands) of debt outstanding at December 31, 1993:

Deferred Aircraft Rent


  During 1993, the Company negotiated with several of its lessors to defer
approximately $14.7 million of lease payments on eight aircraft.  Of this
amount, $6.6 million was repaid during 1993.  The remaining deferrals are
scheduled to be repaid beginning the second quarter of 1994 and bear interest at
rates ranging from 7% to 12%.  Principal payments in 1994 amount to $6.3
million, with the remaining amounts due as follows (in thousands):

  Property under capital leases consists of equipment leases and are amortized
on a straight-line basis over the lease terms or expected useful life of the
assets.  Accumulated amortization under capital leases was $3.2 million and $2.5
million at December 31, 1993, and 1992, respectively.  Amortization expense of
property under capital lease totaled $658,000, $522,000, and $456,000 for the
years ended December 31, 1993, 1992, and 1991, respectively.

Operating Leases

  In October 1992 and January 1993, World Airways signed a series of agreements
with International Lease Finance Corporation ("ILFC"), McDonnell Douglas
Corporation, GATX Capital Corporation, and Pratt and Whitney to lease seven new
McDonnell Douglas MD-11 aircraft under initial lease terms of two to five years.
Six of the seven aircraft leases contain annual renewal options in years three
through fifteen of the lease term.  Under the terms of the lease agreements,
World Airways may be required to pay additional rent in excess of the fixed
monthly amounts depending on block hours flown.  World Airways took delivery of
four passenger MD-11s in 1993, and is scheduled to take delivery of one
freighter MD-11 in 1994 and two convertible MD-11s in 1995. The delivery of the
convertible MD-11s is expected to occur approximately six months after the end
of the lease in 1994 of three DC10-30 convertibles.  The leases contain options
to purchase the aircraft at various times throughout the lease terms.  Long-term
deposits consist primarily of deposits on the MD-11 leases.  As part of the
lease agreements, World Airways was assigned purchase options for four
additional MD-11 aircraft.  At December 31, 1992, World Airways made non-
refundable deposits toward three of the option aircraft.  During 1993, the
options' exercise dates were extended to July 30, 1994 with scheduled aircraft
delivery dates from August 1995 to September 1996.  If the options are
exercised, World Airways intends to obtain financing for the purchases.

  In February 1992, World Airways signed twelve year operating leases for two
McDonnell Douglas DC10-30 passenger aircraft.  In July 1993, World Airways
returned these aircraft to their lessor which resulted in a $1.5 million early
termination payment of which $1.1 million was expensed in 1993.

  In October 1993, the Company returned an aircraft to its lessor and recorded
an expense of $1.2 million related to the early termination of the lease.

  Rental expense, primarily relating to aircraft leases, totaled approximately
$52.1 million, $39.6 million, and $43.0 million for the years ended December 31,
1993, 1992, and 1991, respectively.

  The following is a schedule of future annual minimum rental payments (in
thousands), principally aircraft rentals (excluding variable portions), required
under operating leases that have initial or remaining noncancellable lease terms
in excess of one year as of December 31, 1993:

11.  COMMON STOCK PURCHASE WARRANTS

Drexel Warrants

  On June 30, 1988, the Company issued to Drexel Burnham Lambert, Incorporated
("Drexel") warrants expiring May 24, 1994 to purchase 1,000,000 shares of the
Company's common stock at a price of $8.00 per share, subject to certain
antidilution adjustments (the "Drexel Warrants").  On July 31, 1989, the Company
purchased 500,000 of these warrants from Drexel for $1.3 million.  In 1992,
37,500 of these warrants were exercised.  At December 31, 1993, there were
462,500 Drexel Warrants fully vested and outstanding.

BNYFC Warrants

  On December 7, 1993, in connection with a revolving line of credit facility
and an aircraft parts security agreement (see Notes 9 and 10), the Company
granted to Bank of New York Financial Corporation ("BNYFC") warrants expiring
December 7, 1996 to purchase 250,000 shares of the Company's common stock, at a
price of $6.15 per share. These warrants include certain registration rights.
At December 31, 1993, these warrants were fully vested and outstanding.

1986  Executive Warrants

  During 1986, the Company entered into agreements with certain officers of the
Company to issue 3,600,000  warrants, expiring May 24, 1994, each to purchase
one share of the Company's common stock at a price of $5.00 per share, subject
to certain antidilution adjustments (the "1986 Executive Warrants").  During
1993, 1992, and 1991, 779,875, 0, and 237,789, respectively, of these warrants
were exercised.  At December 31, 1993, a total of 2,362,336 of the 1986
Executive Warrants are fully vested and outstanding.

1989  Executive Warrants

  During 1989, the Company entered into warrant agreements with certain officers
of the Company providing for the issuance of warrants ("1989 Executive
Warrants") to purchase a total of 745,000 shares of Company common stock at an
exercise price of $5.50;  such warrants to vest, at differing rates, over 60
months.  The 1989 Executive Warrants expire on August 31, 1997.  On November 1,
1990, Mr. T. Coleman Andrews cancelled his right to receive 250,000  warrants
granted to him under his 1989 Executive Warrant agreement, and the agreement was
terminated.  Mr. Andrews agreed to cancel his right to receive the 250,000
warrants so that equity compensation under the 1988 Stock Option Plan could be
granted in 1990 to officers of the Company and its subsidiaries.  During 1991,
163,417 of the warrants were cancelled.  During 1992, 40,000 of these warrants
were cancelled.  At December 31, 1993, there were 291,583 1989 Executive
Warrants outstanding of which 276,416 are fully vested.

12.  STOCK OPTIONS

   On July 19, 1988, the Board of Directors approved The WorldCorp, Inc. 1988
Stock Option Plan (the "1988 Plan").  The 1988 Plan was amended and restated on
May 13, 1992.  The 1988 Plan calls for one share of WorldCorp common stock to be
issued upon exercise of one stock option.  Shares issuable under the 1988 Plan,
as amended, shall not exceed 2,800,000 in the aggregate.  Options may be granted
to employees and directors at the discretion of the Administrative Committee of
the 1988 Plan.  In 1990,  the 1988 Plan was amended to change the vesting
percentage to 20% per year beginning on the grant date provided that the grantee
was still an employee of the Company or a subsidiary.

   During 1991, the Company made cash payments totaling $35,054 in exchange for
the cancellation of 9,670 options.

   A summary of option transactions under the 1988 Plan for the years ended
December 31, 1991, 1992, and 1993 is presented below:

13.  EMPLOYEE BENEFIT PLANS

   During 1989, the Company adopted an Employee Stock Ownership Plan (the
"ESOP") for the benefit of employees not covered by collective bargaining
agreements.  The ESOP is designed as a stock bonus plan which qualifies for
favorable tax treatment under Section 401(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of
1986, as amended (the "Code"),  and as an employee stock ownership plan under
Section 4975(e)(7) of the Code.  In addition, the ESOP includes a "cash or
deferred arrangement" under Section 401(k) of the Code.

   During 1989, the ESOP acquired 450,000  shares of common stock from Violet
June Daly and 450,000 shares of common stock from the Estate of Edward J. Daly.
The purchase price in each transaction was $4.00 per share or a total of $3.6
million. The ESOP obtained bank financing of $3.6 million (the "ESOP Loan") that
matures seven years from funding and requires quarterly principal payments of
$90,000 and a final principal payment of $1,080,000. Interest at 85% of the
bank's prime rate is payable monthly. At December 31, 1993, the ESOP had pledged
478,501 shares as collateral for the loan and the loan is guaranteed by
WorldCorp. Under the guarantee, the Company is also required to meet certain
restrictive covenants. The Company is required to make minimum annual
discretionary contributions to the ESOP in an amount necessary to pay principal
and interest due on the ESOP Loan to the extent that other contributions to the
ESOP are insufficient to make such payments. In 1992, contributions from
employees combined with employer matching contributions were sufficient to make
required principal and interest payments.  The Company expensed $0.2 million and
$0.1 million of principal and interest for the ESOP Loan in 1993 and 1991,
respectively.

   In 1990, the ESOP was replaced by the Employee Savings and Stock Ownership
Plan ("ESSOP").  Participation in the ESSOP is limited to employees not covered
under a collective bargaining agreement.  Employees may elect to invest Salary
Deferral Contributions in either the WorldCorp Stock Fund or in Other Investment
Funds.  The ESSOP provides employer matching contributions in the WorldCorp
Stock Fund at a rate determined by the Board of Directors, but at least 50% of
the Salary Deferral Contribution.  The employer matching contribution rate in
the WorldCorp Stock Fund for 1993, 1992 and 1991 was 100%.  The employer
matching contribution in Other Investment Funds is at the rate of 33 1/3% of the
Salary Deferral Contribution.  The Company charged approximately $416,000,
$394,000, and $273,000 to expense for its contributions to the ESSOP in 1993,
1992 and 1991, respectively.

   The World Airways' Crewmembers Target Benefit Plan is a defined contribution
plan covering flight engineers and pilots with contributions based upon defined
wages.  This is a tax-qualified retirement plan under Section 401(a) of the
Code.  The World Airways' Flight Attendants Target Benefit Plan is a defined
contribution plan covering flight attendants with contributions based upon
defined wages.  This is a tax-qualified retirement plan under Section 401(a) of
the Code.  Pension expense for both plans totaled $1,524,000, $1,288,000, and
$1,165,000 for the years ended December 31, 1993, 1992  and 1991, respectively.

   Effective January 1, 1987, World Airways adopted the World Airways, Inc.
Profit Sharing Bonus Plan (the "1987  Profit Sharing Plan").  Contributions to
the 1987 Profit Sharing Plan are equal to 20% of World Airways'

                                       36
<PAGE>
 
defined operating income, subject to an annual limitation of 10% of the total
annual aggregate compensation of World Airways' employees participating in the
1987 Profit Sharing Plan in that year.  This is not a tax-qualified retirement
plan under Section 401(a) of the Code. Prior to 1993, contributions to the 1987
Profit Sharing Plan were allocated first to payments to all persons or their
beneficiaries whose wages were reduced during the time from December 1, 1982 to
January 31, 1985.  The total wage reduction for this period was approximately
$5.8 million.  World Airways has repaid the entire $5.8 million as of December
31, 1992.  Approximately $0.8 million was distributed in 1993 pertaining to 1992
financial results.  The Company does not anticipate any distributions in 1994
pertaining to 1993 financial results.

   World Airways' cockpit crewmembers and eligible dependents are covered under
postretirement health care benefits to age 65.  Effective January 1, 1992, World
Airways adopted Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 106, Employers'
                                                                     ----------
Accounting for Postretirement Benefits Other Than Pensions ("FAS #106").  FAS
- ----------------------------------------------------------                   
#106 requires accrual accounting for all postretirement benefits other than
pensions.  Prior to the adoption of FAS #106, the cost of health benefits for
cockpit retirees was recognized by charging claims to expense as they were
incurred.  The Company elected to immediately recognize the cumulative effect of
the change in accounting for postretirement benefits of $2.0 million in 1992.
1991's financial results have not been restated.  World Airways funds the
benefit costs on a pay-as-you-go (cash) basis.

   A summary of the net periodic postretirement benefit cost for the year ended
December 31, 1993 is as follows:

</TABLE>

   The assumed discount rate used to measure the accumulated postretirement
benefit obligation for 1993 was 6.25%.  The medical cost trend rate in 1993 was
11.75% trending down to an ultimate rate in 2011 of  4.25%.  A one percentage
point increase in the assumed health care cost trend rates for each future year
would have increased the aggregate of the service and interest cost components
of 1993 net periodic postretirement benefit cost by $30,000 and would have
increased the accumulated postretirement benefit obligation as of December 31,
1993 by $175,000.

14.  FEDERAL AND STATE INCOME TAXES

   Effective January 1, 1992 the Company adopted FAS #109.  There was no
adjustment necessary for the cumulative effect of this change in accounting for
income taxes as of January 1, 1992.  The 1991 financial statements have not been
restated to apply the provisions of FAS #109.  The consolidated provision for
income taxes consists entirely of current income taxes and excludes any amounts
related to US Order since US Order is not part of WorldCorp and subsidiaries
consolidated income tax return.

   Total income tax expense was allocated as follows (in thousands):

   The availability of net operating loss, investment tax credit, and
alternative minimum tax credit carryforwards to reduce the Company's future
Federal income tax liability is subject to limitations under the Internal
Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the "Code").  Generally, these limitations
restrict the availability of net operating loss and investment tax credit
carryforwards upon certain changes in stock ownership by five percent
shareholders which, in aggregate, exceed 50 percentage points in value in the
three-year testing period ("Ownership Change").

   In August 1991, 5.7 million shares of common stock were sold by a group of
existing shareholders.  This transaction constituted an Ownership Change, which
reduced the annual utilization of net operating loss, alternative minimum tax
credit, and investment tax credit carryforwards ("Carryforwards") available to
the Company in 1991 and future years.  As of December 31, 1993, the Company had
net operating loss carryforwards for federal income tax purposes of $72.6
million [subject to a $6.3 million annual limitation based on the value of the
outstanding Common Stock immediately prior to the Ownership Change and the
statutorily provided long-term tax exempt rate (the "Limitation")] and $64.6
million (generated after the Ownership Change) which are available to offset
future federal taxable income.  These carryforwards expire between 1995 and
2008.

   On February 28, 1994, the Company sold 24.9% of World Airways' common stock
to MHS Berhad ("MHS"), decreasing WorldCorp's ownership in World Airways to
75.1% (see Note 18).  The Code permits a controlled group to file a consolidated
tax return that includes all subsidiaries which are at least 80% owned by the
parent company.  As a result, for the period beginning March 1, 1994, World
Airways will be required to file a separate company tax return and will no
longer be included in the WorldCorp and subsidiaries consolidated U.S. income
tax return.  As a result, approximately $84.4 million of the consolidated net
operating loss carryforwards for federal income tax purposes (subject to the
Limitation) will be allocated to World Airways, and will no longer be available
to offset federal taxable income reflected on future consolidated tax returns.

   World Airways settled its litigation with the State of California Franchise
Tax Board (the "Board") concerning assessments of deficiencies in state
franchise taxes for the years 1973-1975 and 1978.  The Board had asserted a
total tax deficiency of $2.4 million and unpaid interest of $5.9 million.  This
final settlement resulted in the reversal of a previously recorded liability and
the recognition of a 1991 non-operating gain of $5.5 million, net of related
legal expenses.

15.  SEGMENT INFORMATION

   The Company operates in two business segments:  air transportation and
transaction processing.  The air transportation segment consists of the
operations of World Airways, a worldwide provider of air transportation for
commercial and government customers.  The Company's transaction processing
business consists of its 46% ownership of the voting stock of US Order, a
company that has developed a patented, automated ordering system with
residential and commercial applications.

   Summarized financial information by business segment is as follows (in

   The Company's contract with the United States Air Mobility Command ("AMC")
expires in September 1994.  The Company anticipates that future renewals of the
AMC contract will be on an annual basis.

   World Airways has provided service to MAS since 1981, transporting passengers
for the annual Hadj pilgrimage as well as providing aircraft for integration
into MAS' scheduled passenger and cargo operations. The current MAS contract,
which was entered into in 1992, expires in 1996. However, in 1992 the government
of Malaysia instructed the Malaysian Hadj Board (which in turn instructed MAS)
to competitively rebid the contract for the 1993 Hadj. MAS rebid the contract
for the 1993 Hadj and World Airways was again selected to provide 1993 Hadj
service to MAS.  World's management believes that its contract with MAS through
1996 is a legally binding obligation.  MHS has agreed to acquire 32% of MAS in
1994 (see Note 18).

   World Airways has provided service to Garuda since 1988 under an annual
contract.  World Airways supplied six of Garuda's sixteen aircraft necessary for
its 1993 Hadj operations and will provide six aircraft for the 1994 Garuda Hadj
operations.

   World Airways provided service to Burlington Air Express in 1993.  At this
time, World Airways has no contract for services in 1994.

16.  RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS

   Effective November 10, 1988,  T. Coleman Andrews', III employment agreement
to serve as Chief Executive Officer and President of WorldCorp, which was
originally entered into in August 1986, was extended an additional five years to
August 1, 1994.  The contract will automatically be extended annually at the end
of the term of the agreement unless either party provides a twelve month
advance, written notice of their intent to terminate the agreement.  The Company
and Mr. Andrews did not provide written notice of their intent to terminate the
Agreement, and therefore, Mr. Andrews' employment agreement has been
automatically extended through August 1995.  In connection with the employment
agreement, Mr. Andrews also entered into a Supplemental Incentive agreement with
WorldCorp that provides for a bonus in the amount of $1,300,000 plus interest
earned at 8.91% to be paid to Mr. Andrews on August 1, 1994 provided he is still
an employee of WorldCorp at that time. This amount is included in  accrued wages
in the accompanying 1993 consolidated balance sheet.  In connection with this
employment arrangement, the Company loaned Mr. Andrews  $1,300,000  on January
10, 1989.  Mr. Andrews executed and delivered to the Company a full recourse
promissory note dated January 10, 1989.  The principal

                                       40
<PAGE>
 
amount of the note is due and payable on December 31, 1994 and interest accrues
quarterly and is payable at maturity at a fixed rate of 8.91% per annum.  This
amount is included in prepaid expenses and other current assets in the
accompanying 1993 consolidated balance sheet.

   On September 10, 1990,  the Board of Directors of WorldCorp unanimously
authorized WorldCorp to enter into and consummate a Stock Purchase Agreement
dated as of September 14, 1990 (the "Stock Purchase Agreement"), under which
WorldCorp agreed to purchase Series A Preferred Stock ("Preferred Stock") issued
by US Order.  The Board of Directors of the Company authorized the purchase of
US Order, a development stage company with limited revenue to date, as part of
the Company's continuing efforts to diversify its interests.  Mr. Gorog is
Chairman of the Board of US Order and is Chairman of the Board of Directors of
WorldCorp.  Mr. Gorog, together with certain members of his immediate family
(the "Founders"), were majority owners of US Order.  On July 1, 1992, the
Company purchased an incremental 6% of the preferred stock of US Order for $1.0
million which increased the Company's ownership in US Order to 51%.
Accordingly, US Order's financial position, results of operations, and statement
of cash flows have been consolidated in the accompanying financial statements
for the period subsequent to July 1, 1992.  All significant intercompany
balances have been eliminated.  Prior to July 1, 1992, WorldCorp's investment
was accounted for using the equity method.  As of December 31, 1993, WorldCorp
had purchased for $5.3 million a total of 5,204,082 shares of US Order preferred
stock, which are convertible into common stock. In December 1992, WorldCorp
agreed to convert $7.6 million in principal amount of loans from WorldCorp to US
Order into 7,550 shares of redeemable preferred stock of US Order.  The
preferred stock pays quarterly dividends at a rate of 7.5%.  As part of this
transaction, WorldCorp's option to purchase additional shares of the capital
stock of US Order was extended from September 15, 1993 to December 15, 1994, and
WorldCorp received an exclusive license to apply US Order's transaction
processing technology to lottery and gaming applications. In December 1993, US
Order completed a private equity placement for $12.0 million with financial and
strategic partners.  WorldCorp invested $1.7 million in this equity offering.
Following this transaction, WorldCorp owns 46% of the voting stock of US Order.
US Order is still in the developmental stage and, therefore, the gain resulting
from this transaction of $0.8 million was recorded as additional paid-in-capital
in the accompanying consolidated financial statements.  Additionally, the
intangible asset previously recorded by the Company was eliminated. WorldCorp
and the financial and strategic partners of US Order own stock which carry
liquidation preferences pursuant to which WorldCorp is currently entitled to 59%
of any distributions.  The results of operations of US Order are allocated based
on liquidation preferences. WorldCorp provided consulting services to assist US
Order's management during 1993, 1992 and 1991. US Order paid consulting fees to
WorldCorp equal to the cost of the salary and benefits of WorldCorp personnel
who performed these services.

17.  COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES

Litigation and Claims

   On August 11, 1992, WorldCorp, World Airways, and certain other commercial
paper customers of Washington Bancorporation ("WBC") were served with a
complaint by WBC as debtor-in-possession by and through the Committee of
Unsecured Creditors of WBC (the "Committee").  The complaint arises from
investment proceeds totaling $6.8 million received by WorldCorp and World
Airways from WBC in May 1990 in connection with the maturity of WBC commercial
paper.  The Committee seeks to recover $2.0 million from WorldCorp and $4.8
million from World Airways on the grounds that these payments constituted
voidable preferences and/or fraudulent conveyances under the Federal Bankruptcy
Code and under applicable state law.  The Company has filed a motion to dismiss
this complaint and intends to defend vigorously against these claims.  No
assurances can be given of the eventual outcome of this litigation.

   On February 3, 1992, the US Patent and Trademark Office ("PTO") issued an
order granting a request to reexamine US Order's patent based on a previously
issued patent to a third party. On April 3, 1993, the PTO completed its
reexamination and approved the amended claims of US Order's patent. Other claims
of patent infringement have also been asserted or threatened against US Order.
Although US Order and its counsel believe that US Order has substantial defenses
to any claim of infringement, there can be no assurances that US Order would
prevail in any such proceedings. In addition, upon the occurrence of certain
events such as the bankruptcy of US

Order, an investor of the company receives a fully paid, non exclusive worldwide
license to certain of US Order's licensed technology.

   The Company is involved in various other claims and legal actions arising in
the ordinary course of business.  In the opinion of management, the ultimate
disposition of these matters will not have a material adverse effect on the
Company's consolidated financial position.

Letters of Credit

   At December 31, 1993 and 1992, restricted cash and short-term investments
included customer deposits held in escrow and cash pledged as collateral for
various letters of credit facilities issued by a bank on the Company's behalf
totaling $1.0 million and $2.9 million, respectively, with expiration dates
principally occurring in 1994.

Options on MD-11 Aircraft

   The Company has options to purchase four MD-11 aircraft, which, if exercised,
would require a downpayment equal to five percent of the purchase price in July
1994.

18.  SUBSEQUENT EVENTS

   On October 30, 1993, WorldCorp, Inc., World Airways, Inc., and MHS Berhad
("MHS") entered into a Stock Purchase Agreement (the "Stock Purchase Agreement")
pursuant to which MHS, subject to satisfactory completion of its due diligence
investigations, agreed to purchase 24.9% of World Airways' common stock for
$27.4 million in cash.  Under this Agreement, World Airways would receive upon
closing $12.4 million to fund its working capital requirements.  The remaining
$15.0 million would be paid to WorldCorp to add to its cash reserves. The
Company received $2.7 million prior to December 31, 1993 as an advance on the
sales price.  At the time of the signing of the Stock Purchase Agreement, World
Airways was a wholly-owned subsidiary of WorldCorp.  On February 28, 1994,
WorldCorp, World Airways, and MHS concluded the transaction according to the
terms described above.  As a result of this transaction, WorldCorp will
recognize a gain of approximately $27.0 million in the first quarter of 1994.
Under this agreement, if at any time after October 30, 1996 World Airways
registers its common stock under the Securities Act of 1993, MHS has the right
to demand the registration of its shares.  Also, if without the prior written
consent of MHS: (1) World Airways sells all or substantially all of its
business; or (2) World Airways fundamentally changes its line of business, then
MHS has the option (a) to sell or transfer all or a portion of its shares to a
third party notwithstanding the aforementioned three-year holding period; and/or
(b) to require WorldCorp to purchase all or part of MHS's shares at fair market
value.  Fair market value may not be less than the aggregate of the costs borne
by MHS in acquiring and holding its World Airways shares.  Management has
indicated that it does not intend to take any such actions without the prior
consent of MHS.

   MHS recently announced that it will acquire 32% of Malaysian Airline System
Berhad ("MAS"), the flag carrier of Malaysia.  MAS is one of World Airways'
largest commercial customers.

                          INDEPENDENT AUDITORS' REPORT



The Board of Directors and Stockholders
WorldCorp, Inc. :


We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of WorldCorp, Inc.
and subsidiaries (WorldCorp) as of December 31, 1993 and 1992, and the related
consolidated statements of operations, changes in common stockholders' deficit
and cash flows for each of the years in the three-year period ended December 31,
1993.  In connection with our audits of the consolidated financial statements,
we also have audited the related financial statement schedules as listed in Item
14(a)2 herein.  These consolidated financial statements and financial statement
schedules are the responsibility of WorldCorp's management.  Our responsibility
is to express an opinion on these consolidated financial statements and
financial statement schedules based on our audits.

We conducted our audits in accordance with generally accepted auditing
standards.  Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material
misstatement.  An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting
the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements.  An audit also includes
assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by
management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation.
We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.

In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present
fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of WorldCorp, Inc. and
subsidiaries as of December 31, 1993 and 1992, and the results of their
operations and their cash flows for each of the years in the three-year period
ended December 31, 1993, in conformity with generally accepted accounting
principles.  Also in our opinion, the related financial statement schedules,
when considered in relation to the basic consolidated financial statements taken
as a whole, present fairly, in all material respects, the information set forth
therein.

As discussed in Notes 13 and 14 to the consolidated financial statements,
effective January 1, 1992, WorldCorp adopted the provisions of the Financial
Accounting Standards Board's Statements of Financial Accounting Standards No.
106,"Employers' Accounting for Postretirement Benefits Other Than Pensions", and
No. 109,"Accounting for Income Taxes".

failure on Lender's part to provide adequate accounts receivable management and

chargeable to Borrower's account thereafter.

(discretionary or otherwise) hereunder may result during the term of this
Agreement in one or more increases or decreases in the Advance Rates and
Borrower hereby consents to any such increases or decreases which may limit or
restrict advances requested by Borrower.

       (g) If Borrower does not pay any interest, fees, costs, charges or
commissions to Lender when due, Borrower shall thereby be deemed to have
requested, and Lender is hereby authorized at its discretion to make and charge
to Borrower's account, a Revolving Credit Advance to Borrower as of such date in
an amount equal to such unpaid interest, fees, costs, charges or commissions.
Borrower hereby acknowledges that Lender may

charge to Borrower's account all amounts owing to Lender hereunder when the same
are due.

       (h) Any sums expended by Lender due to Borrower's failure to perform or
comply with its obligations under this Agreement, including but not limited to
the payment of taxes, insurance premiums or leasehold obligations, shall be
charged to Borrower's account as a Revolving Credit Advance and added to the
Obligations, provided however that Lender will use its best efforts to give the
Borrower two Business Days advance notice of its intent to expend such sums.

       (i) Lender will account to Borrower monthly with a statement of all Loans
and other advances, charges and payments made pursuant to this Agreement, and
such account rendered by Lender shall be deemed final, binding and conclusive

which objection is made.

to Borrower on the same Business Day as such collection (if practical) and
otherwise on the next Business Day after such collection.

Lender to Borrower at Borrower's request.

        ---------------------------------------                            
borrowing of Revolving Credit Advances prior to 1:00 P.M. New York time on the
Business Day of its request to incur, on that day, a Revolving Credit Advance.
All Revolving Credit Advances shall be disbursed from whichever office or other
place in the United States Lender may designate from time to time and, together
with any and all other Obligations of Borrower to Lender, shall be charged to
the Borrower's account on Lender's books. The proceeds of each Revolving Credit
Advance made by the Lender shall be made available to the Borrower on the day so
requested by way of credit to the Borrower's operating account maintained with
such bank as Borrower designated to Lender by Federal Funds Wire. Any and all
Obligations due and owing hereunder may be charged to Borrower's account and
shall constitute Revolving Credit Advances.

     5.  Interest; Fees; Commissions.
         --------------------------- 

         (a)  Interest.

              (i) Except as modified by Section 5(a)(iii) below, interest on
Revolving Credit Advances shall be payable in arrears on the last day of each
month. Interest payments hereunder may, at Lender's option be charged by Lender
to Borrower's account. Interest charges shall be computed on the unpaid balance
of the Revolving Credit Advances for each day they are outstanding at a rate per
annum equal to the Contract Rate. In the event the aggregate amount of Revolving
Credit Advances exceeds the Formula Amount for ten (10) or more days in any
month during the Term, the average daily balance of Revolving Credit Advances in
that month shall bear interest at the Overadvance Rate.

              (ii)   Interest shall be computed on the basis of actual days
elapsed over a 360-day year.

              (iii)  Upon the occurrence and during the continuance of an Event
of Default described in Section 18(a), interest shall be payable at the
Default Rate on the amount overdue.

              (iv)   Notwithstanding the foregoing, in no event shall interest
exceed the maximum rate permitted under any applicable law or regulation, and
if any provision of this Agreement or an Ancillary Agreement is in
contravention of any such law or regulation, such provision shall be deemed
amended to provide for interest at said maximum rate and any excess amount
shall either be applied, at Lender's option, to the outstanding
<PAGE>
 
                                      -15-

Loans in such order as Lenders shall determine or refunded by Lender to
Borrower.

              (v) Borrower shall pay principal, interest and all other amounts
payable hereunder, or under any Ancillary Agreement, without any deduction
whatsoever, including, but not limited to, any deduction for any set-off or
counterclaim.

         (b)  Fees.

              (i)   Closing Fee. Upon execution of this Agreement by Borrower
                    ----------- 
and Lender, Borrower shall pay to Lender a closing fee in an amount equal to
$100,000.00. Any portion of the Deposit delivered to us pursuant to the
proposal letter remaining in your account with us after all expenses have been
applied, shall be offset against the closing fee.

              (ii)  Due Diligence Fee. Upon execution of this Agreement by
                    -----------------
Borrower and Lender, Borrower shall pay to Lender a due diligence fee in an
amount equal to $100,000.

              (iii) Facility Fee. Borrower shall pay to Lender a facility fee in
                    ------------
an amount equal to $185,000.00, payable in installments of $10,000 per month
during the first year of the Term and $5,000 per month thereafter.

              (iv)   Collateral Monitoring Fee. Upon Lender's performance of any
                     -------------------------                                  
collateral monitoring - namely any field examination, collateral analysis or
other business analysis, the need for which is to be determined by Lender and
which monitoring is undertaken by Lender or for Lender's benefit, an amount
equal to $600.00 per day, per person, for each person employed to perform such
monitoring together with all reasonable out-of-pocket costs, disbursements and
expenses incurred by the Lender and the person performing such collateral
monitoring shall be charged to Borrower's account provided that such charges
shall not exceed $10,000.00 annually.

              (v) Unused Facility Fee. Borrower shall pay to Lender monthly, an
                  -------------------                                          
unused facility fee, at the rate of .5% (one-half of one percent) per annum on
the difference between $8,000,000 and the average daily amount of Revolving
Credit Advances which have been made based upon Receivables.

       (c) Increased Costs. In the event that a change shall occur after the
           ---------------                                                  
Closing Date in any applicable law, treaty or governmental regulation, or in the
interpretation or application thereof, or compliance by Lender (for purposes of
this Section 5(c), the term "Lender" shall include Lender and any corporation or
bank controlling Lender) with any request or directive (whether or not having
the force of law) from any central bank or other financial, monetary or other
authority, if such request results from such a change, shall:
<PAGE>
 
                                    -16-
 
          (i)   subject Lender to any stamp, documentary or similar tax with
respect to this Agreement or any Ancillary Agreements;

          (ii)  impose, modify or hold applicable with respect to the Loans any
reserve, special deposit, assessment or similar requirement against assets held
by, or deposits in or for the account of, advances or loans by, or other credit
extended by, any office of Lender, including (without limitation) pursuant to
Regulation D of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System; or

          (iii) impose on Lender any other condition with respect to this
Agreement or any Ancillary Agreements; and the result of any of the foregoing is
to increase the cost to Lender of making, renewing or maintaining its Loans
hereunder by an amount that Lender deems to be material or to reduce the amount
of any payment (whether of principal, interest or otherwise) in respect of any
of the Loans by an amount that Lender deems to be material, then, in any case
Borrower shall promptly pay Lender, upon its demand, such additional amount as
will compensate Lender for such additional cost or such reduction, as the case
may be. Lender shall certify the amount and method of calculation of such
additional cost or reduced amount to Borrower, and such certification shall be
conclusive absent manifest error. Lender shall take such reasonable steps, as
Borrower may request and at Borrower's expense, to minimize such costs provided
such steps have no adverse effect on Lender.

       (d)  Capital Adequacy.
            ---------------- 

            (i) In the event that a change after the Closing Date in any
applicable law, rule, regulation or guideline regarding capital adequacy, or in
the interpretation or administration thereof by any governmental authority,
central bank or comparable agency charged with the interpretation or
administration thereof, or compliance by Lender (for purposes of this Section
5(d), the term "Lender" shall include Lender and any corporation or bank
controlling Lender) with any request or directive regarding capital adequacy
(whether or not having the force of law) of any such authority, central bank or
comparable agency, which request or directive results from such a change, has
the effect of reducing the rate of return on Lender's capital as a consequence
of its obligations hereunder to a level below that which Lender could have
achieved but for such adoption, change or compliance (taking into consideration
Lender's general policies with respect to capital adequacy) by an amount deemed
by Lender to be material, then, from time to time, Borrower shall pay upon
demand to Lender such additional amount or amounts as will compensate Lender for
such reduction. In determining such amount or amounts, Lender may use any
reasonable averaging or attribution methods. The protection of this Section
shall be
<PAGE>
 
                                      -17-

available to Lender regardless of any possible contention of invalidity or
inapplicability with respect to the applicable law, regulation or condition
Lender shall take such reasonable steps, as Borrower may request and at
Borrower's expense, to minimize such costs provided such steps have no adverse
effect on Lender.

            (ii) A certificate of Lender setting forth such amount or amounts as
shall be necessary to compensate Lender with respect to Section 5(d) hereof and
the method of calculation thereof when delivered to Borrower shall be conclusive
absent manifest error.

       (e)  Commission.
            ---------- 

            (i) Borrower shall pay to Lender monthly, on the fifteenth day of
each month, a commission on each invoice evidencing a Receivable purchased
hereunder during the prior month of $5.00.

       (f)  Matured Funds. On the last day of each month during the Term, Lender
            -------------                                                       
shall credit Borrower's account with interest at the Matured Funds Rate in
effect during such month on the average daily balance during such month of any
amounts payable by Lender to Borrower hereunder which are not drawn by Borrower
on the Settlement Date.

       6.  Security Interest.
           ----------------- 

       (a) To secure the prompt payment to Lender of the Obligations, Borrower
hereby assigns, pledges and grants to Lender a continuing security interest in
and to the Collateral, whether now owned or existing or hereafter acquired or
arising and wheresoever located (whether or not the same is subject to Article 9
of the Uniform Commercial Code). All of the Borrower's ledger sheets, files,
records, books of account, business papers and documents relating to the
Collateral shall, until delivered to or removed by Lender, be kept by Borrower
in trust for Lender until all Obligations have been paid in full. Each
confirmatory assignment schedule or other form of assignment hereafter executed
by Borrower shall be deemed to include the foregoing grant, whether or not the
same appears therein.

       (b) Lender may file one or more financing statements disclosing Lender's
security interest in the Collateral without Borrower's signature appearing
thereon or Lender may sign on Borrower's behalf as provided in paragraph 13
hereof. The parties agree that a carbon, photographic or other reproduction of
this Agreement shall be sufficient as a financing statement. If any Receivable
becomes evidenced by a promissory note or any other instrument for the payment
of money, Borrower will immediately deliver such instrument to Lender
appropriately endorsed.

                                    -18-

     7. Representations Concerning the Collateral. Borrower represents and
        -----------------------------------------                         
warrants (each of which such representations and warranties shall be deemed
repeated upon the making of each request for a Revolving Credit Advance and made
as of the time of each and every Revolving Credit Advance hereunder):

       (a) all the Collateral (i) is owned by Borrower free and clear of all
claims, liens, security interests and encumbrances (including without limitation
any claims of infringement) except (A) those in Lender's favor and (B) Permitted
Liens and (ii) is not subject to any agreement prohibiting the granting of a
security interest or requiring notice of or consent to the granting of a
security interest;

       (b) all Receivables except those with respect to which Borrower has
notified Lender at the time of assignment were not to be treated as Eligible
Receivables (i) represent complete bona fide transactions which require no
further act under any circumstances on Borrower's part to make such Receivables
payable by Customers, (ii) to the best of Borrower's knowledge, are not subject
to any present, future or contingent Disputes and (iii) do not represent bill
and hold sales, consignment sales, guaranteed sales, sale or return or other
similar understandings or obligations of any Affiliate or Subsidiary of
Borrower.

     8. Covenants Concerning the Collateral. During the Term, Borrower covenants
        -----------------------------------                                     
that it shall:

       (a) not dispose of any of the Collateral whether by sale, lease or
otherwise except for (i) the sale of Inventory in the ordinary course of
business, (ii) the sale of Spare Parts Inventory, (iii) the disposition or
transfer of obsolete and worn-out Equipment in the ordinary course of business
during any fiscal year having an aggregate fair market value of not more than
$200,000 and, if in excess of said amount, only to the extent that (x) the
proceeds of any such disposition are used to acquire replacement Equipment which
is subject to Lender's first priority security interest or (y) the proceeds of
which are remitted to Lender in reduction of the Obligations and (iv) the
disposition of General Intangibles in the ordinary course of business;

       (b) not encumber, mortgage, pledge, assign or grant any security interest
in any Collateral to anyone other than Lender except as set forth on Schedule 1
                                                                     ----------
(B) attached hereto and made a part hereof;
- ---                                        

       (c) place notations upon Borrower's books of account and any financial
statement prepared by Borrower to disclose Lender's security interest in the
Collateral;

       (d) defend the Collateral against the claims and demands of all parties;
<PAGE>
 
                                      -19-

       (e) keep and maintain the Equipment in good operating condition, except
for ordinary wear and tear, and shall make all necessary repairs and
replacements thereof so that the value and operating efficiency shall at all
times be maintained and preserved ordinary wear and tear excepted. Borrower
shall not permit any such items to become a fixture to real estate or accessions
to other personal property;

       (f) not extend the payment terms of any Receivable without prompt notice
thereof to Lender;

       (g) perform all other steps requested by Lender to create and maintain in
Lender's favor a valid perfected first security interest in all Collateral; and

       (h) Borrower shall promptly provide Lender with duplicate originals of
all credits which Borrower issues to its Customers and immediately notify Lender
of any merchandise returns or Disputes. Borrower shall settle all Disputes at no
cost or expense to Lender. Should Lender so elect, during the continuation of
any Event of Default, Lender may at any time in its discretion (i) withdraw
Borrower's authority to issue credits to its Customers without Lender's prior
written consent; (ii) litigate Disputes or settle them directly with Customers
on terms acceptable to Lender; or (iii) direct Borrower to set aside and
identify as Lender's property any returned or repossessed merchandise or other
goods which by sale resulted in Receivables theretofore assigned to Lender
("Retained Goods"). All Retained Goods (and the proceeds thereof) shall be (A)
held by Borrower in trust for Lender as Lender's property, (B) subject to
Lender's security interest hereunder and (C) disposed of only in accordance with
Lender's express written instructions.

     9. Collection and Maintenance of Collateral and Records. Lender may at any
        ----------------------------------------------------                   
time verify Borrower's Receivables utilizing an audit control company or any
other agent of Lender, provided however, that absent an Event of Default, or a
reason to suspect fraud such action may only be taken during normal business
hours upon one Business Day's notice to the Borrower. Lender or Lender's
designee may, but only while an Event of Default in continuing, notify
Customers, at any time at Lender's sole discretion, of Lender's security
interest in Receivables, collect them directly and charge the collection costs
and expenses to Borrower's account, but, unless and until Lender does so or
gives Borrower other instructions, Borrower shall instruct all of its Customers
to make payments on account of Receivables to an account under Lender's dominion
or control at such bank as Lender may designate, as provided by the terms of
Section 23. To the extent Borrower receives any payments on account of
Receivables, it shall hold such payments for Lender's benefit in trust as
Lender's trustee and immediately deliver them to Lender in their original form
with all necessary endorsements or, as
<PAGE>
 
                                      -20-

directed by Lender, deposit such payments as directed by Lender pursuant to
Section 22 hereof. Lender will credit (conditional upon final collection) all
such payments to Borrower's account on the Settlement Date. Once each week
Borrower shall provide Lender with schedules describing all Receivables created
or acquired by Borrower during the preceding seven days and shall execute and
deliver confirmatory written assignments of such Receivables in the form of
Schedule 9 to Lender, but Borrower's failure to execute and deliver such
schedules or written confirmatory assignments of such Receivables shall not
affect or limit Lender's security interest or other rights in and to the
Receivables. Borrower shall furnish, at Lender's request, copies of contracts,
invoices or the equivalent, and any original shipping and delivery receipts for
all merchandise sold or services rendered and such other related documents and
information as Lender may require. All of Borrower's invoices shall bear the
payment terms stated on the applicable customer order, and no change from the
original payment terms of such customer order shall be made without the prior
written consent of Lender. Borrower shall provide Lender on a monthly (within
ten (10) days after the end of each month), or more frequent basis, as requested
by Lender, a summary report of Borrower's current Spare Parts Inventory,
certified as true and accurate by Borrower's President or Chief Financial
Officer. Borrower shall provide Lender, as requested by Lender, such other
schedules, documents and/or information regarding the Collateral as Lender may
reasonably require.

     10. Inspections. At all times during normal business hours, Lender shall
         -----------                                                         
have the right to (a) visit and inspect Borrower's properties and the
Collateral, (b) inspect, audit and make extracts from Borrower's relevant books
and records, including, but not limited to, management letters prepared by
independent accountants, and (c) discuss with Borrower's principal officers, and
independent accountants, Borrower's business, assets, liabilities, financial
condition, results of operations and business prospects provided that absent an
Event of Default or a reason to suspect fraud, such action may be taken only
upon one Business Day's notice to the Borrower. Borrower will deliver to Lender
any instrument necessary for Lender to obtain records from any service bureau
maintaining records for Borrower.

     11. Financial Information. Borrower shall provide Lender (a) as soon as
         ---------------------                                              
available, but in any event within ninety (90) days after the end of each of
Borrower's fiscal years, Borrower's balance sheet as at the end of such fiscal
year and the related statements of income, retained earnings and statement of
cash flow for such fiscal year, setting forth in comparative form the figures as
at the end of and for the previous fiscal year, which shall have been reported
on by Peat Marwick & Co. or such other independent certified public accountants
who shall be reasonably satisfactory to Lender and shall be accompanied by an
unqualified audit report issued by such independent certified
<PAGE>
 
                                      -21-

public accountants; (b) as soon as available, drafts of Borrower's balance sheet
as at the end of each of Borrower's fiscal years and the related statements of
income, retained earnings and statement of cash flow for such fiscal year, which
have been internally prepared by Borrower; (c) as soon as available, but in any
event within forty-five (45) days after the end of each quarter, Borrower's
balance sheet as at the end of such quarter and the related statements of
income, retained earnings and statement of cash flow for such quarter, setting
forth in comparative form the figures as at the end of and for the previous
quarter, which shall have been internally prepared by Borrower and certified as
being prepared in accordance with GAAP, subject to year-end adjustments by its
Chief Financial Officer; (d) as soon as available, but in any event within
thirty (30) days after the close of each month, the balance sheet as at the end
of such month and the related statements of income, retained earnings and
statement of cash flow for such month, which have been internally prepared by
Borrower and certified by its Chief Financial Officer as being prepared in
accordance with GAAP, subject to year-end adjustments. All financial statements
required under (a), (b), (c) and (d) above shall be prepared in accordance with
GAAP, subject to year-end adjustments in the case of monthly and quarterly
statements. At the times the financial statements are furnished pursuant to (a),
(b), (c) and (d) above, a certificate of Borrower's President or Chief Financial
Officer shall be delivered to Lender stating that, based on an examination
sufficient to enable him to make an informed statement, no Event of Default or
Incipient Event of Default exists, or, if such is not the case, specifying such
Event of Default or Incipient Event of Default and its nature, when it occurred,
whether it is continuing and the steps being taken by Borrower with respect to
such event. If any internally prepared financial information, including that
required under this paragraph, is unsatisfactory in any manner to Lender, and an
Event of Default is continuing Lender may at its own expense request that
Borrower's independent certified public accountants review same.

     In addition to the foregoing financial statements, Borrower shall furnish
Lender (i) no less than thirty (30) days after the close of each month a
borrowing base certificate in the form of Schedule 11 and (ii) no less than
thirty (30) days prior to the beginning of each fiscal year, or such other
reasonable intervals as may be requested by Lender, commencing with fiscal year
1995, a month by month projected operating budget and cash flow for such fiscal
year (including an income statement for each month and a balance sheet as at the
end of the last month in each fiscal quarter), such projections to be
accompanied by a certificate signed by Borrower's President or Chief Financial
Officer to the effect that such projections have been prepared on the basis of
sound financial planning practice consistent with past budgets and financial
statements and that such officer has no reason to question the reasonableness of
any material assumptions on which such projections were prepared. If any such
<PAGE>
 
                                    -22-

projections are unsatisfactory in any manner to Lender, and an Event of Default
is continuing, Lender may at its own expense request that Borrower's independent
certified public accountants compile or review same. Borrower shall also furnish
Lender with copies of the 10Q, 10K and 8K Statements of WorldCorp, Inc.

     12. Additional Representations, Warranties and Covenants. Borrower
         ----------------------------------------------------          
represents and warrants (each of which such representations and warranties shall
be deemed repeated upon the making of a request for a Revolving Credit Advance
and made as of the time of each Revolving Credit Advance made hereunder), and
covenants that:

       (a) Borrower is a corporation duly organized and validly existing under
the laws of the State of Delaware and duly qualified and in good standing in
every other state or jurisdiction in which the nature of Borrower's business
requires such qualification;

       (b) the execution, delivery and performance of this Agreement and the
Ancillary Agreements (i) have been duly authorized, (ii) are not in
contravention of Borrower's certificate of incorporation, by-laws or of any
indenture, agreement or undertaking to which Borrower is a party or by which
Borrower is bound and (iii) are within Borrower's corporate powers;

       (c) this Agreement and the Ancillary Agreements executed and delivered by
Borrower are Borrower's legal, valid and binding obligations, enforceable in
accordance with their terms;

       (d) it keeps and will continue to keep all of its books and records
concerning the Collateral at Borrower's executive offices located at the address
set forth in the introductory paragraph of this Agreement and will not move such
books and records without giving Lender at least thirty (30) days prior written
notice;

       (e) (i) the operation of Borrower's business is and will continue to be
in compliance in all material respects with all applicable federal, state and
local laws, including but not limited to all applicable environmental laws and
regulations.

          (ii) In the event the Borrower obtains, gives or receives notice of
any release or threat of release of a reportable quantity of any Hazardous
Substances on its property (any such event being hereinafter referred to as a
"Hazardous Discharge") or receives any notice of violation, request for
information or notification that it is potentially responsible for investigation
or cleanup of environmental conditions on its property, demand letter or
complaint, order, citation, or other written notice with regard to any Hazardous
Discharge or violation of any environmental laws affecting its property or
<PAGE>
 
                                      -23-

Borrower's interest therein (any of the foregoing is referred herein as an
"Environmental Complaint") from any Person or entity, including any state agency
responsible in whole or in part for environmental matters in the state in which
such property is located or the United States Environmental Protection Agency
(any such person or entity hereinafter the "Authority"), then the Borrower
shall, within five (5) Business Days, give written notice of same to the Lender
detailing facts and circumstances of which the Borrower is aware giving rise to
the Hazardous Discharge or Environmental Complaint and periodically inform
Lender of the status of the matter. Such information is to be provided to allow
the Lender to protect its security interest in the Collateral and is not
intended to create nor shall it create any obligation upon the Lender with
respect thereto.

          (iii) Borrower shall respond promptly to any Hazardous Discharge or
Environmental Complaint and take all necessary action in order to safeguard the
health of any Person and to avoid subjecting the Collateral to any lien, charge,
claim or encumbrance. If Borrower shall fail to respond promptly to any
Hazardous Discharge or Environmental Complaint or Borrower shall fail to comply
with any of the requirements of any environmental laws, the Lender may, but
without the obligation to do so, for the sole purpose of protecting the Lender's
interest in Collateral: (A) give such notices or (B) enter onto Borrower's
property (or authorize third parties to enter onto such property) and take such
actions as the Lender (or such third parties as directed by the Lender) deem
reasonably necessary or advisable, to clean up, remove, mitigate or otherwise
deal with any such Hazardous Discharge or Environmental Complaint. All
reasonable costs and expenses incurred by the Lender (or such third parties) in
the exercise of any such rights, including any sums paid in connection with any
judicial or administrative investigation or proceedings, fines and penalties,
together with interest thereon from the date expended at the Default Rate for
Revolving Credit Advances shall be paid upon demand by the Borrower, and until
paid shall be added to and become a part of the Obligations secured by the Liens
created by the terms of this Agreement or any other agreement between Lender and
Borrower.

          (iv) Borrower shall defend and indemnify the Lender and hold the
Lender harmless from and against all loss, liability, damage and expense,
claims, costs, fines and penalties, including reasonable attorney's fees,
suffered or incurred by the Lender under or on account of any environmental
laws, including, without limitation, the assertion of any lien thereunder, with
respect to any Hazardous Discharge by Borrower or on its property, the presence
of any Hazardous Substances affecting Borrower's property, whether or not the
same originates or emerges from Borrower's property or any contiguous real
estate, including any loss of value of the Collateral as a result of the
foregoing except to the extent such loss, liability, damage and expense is
attributable to any Hazardous Discharge
<PAGE>
 
                                    -24-
 
resulting from actions on the part of the Lender.  The Borrower's obligations
under this paragraph 12(e) shall arise upon the discovery of the presence of any
Hazardous Substances on the Borrower's property, whether or not any federal,
state, or local environmental agency has taken or threatened any action in
connection with the presence of any hazardous substances. The Borrower's

purposes of this Section 12(o);

       (p) all financial projections of Borrower's performance prepared by
Borrower or at Borrower's direction and delivered to Lender will represent, at

financial performance and will be based upon assumptions which are reasonable in
light of Borrower's past performance and then current business conditions;

Borrower's name on any checks, notes, acceptances, money orders, drafts or other

all acts of the attorney executed as aforesaid. Absent gross negligence, neither
Lender nor the attorney will be liable for any acts or omissions or for any
error of judgment or mistake of fact or law. This power, being coupled with an
interest, is irrevocable so long as any Receivable which is assigned to Lender
or in which Lender has a security interest remains unpaid and until the
Obligations have been fully satisfied.

costs and expenses, including without limitation reasonable fees and
disbursements of counsel retained or employed by Lender and appraisers, in

be secured by the Collateral. Borrower hereby acknowledges that Lender shall not
be liable in any manner whatsoever for any selling expenses, orders, purchases
or contracts of any kind resulting from any transaction between Borrower and any
other Person and Borrower hereby indemnifies and holds Lender harmless with
respect thereto, which indemnity shall survive termination of this Agreement.

     15. Assignment By Lender. In the event of a sale of its assets or stock,

Lender may assign any or all of the Obligations together with any or all of the
security therefor and any transferee shall succeed to all of Lender's rights

retains full decision making authority and administrative responsibility for the
transactions contemplated hereby and the holder of any such participation shall,
subject to the terms of any agreement between Lender and such holder, be
entitled to the same benefits as Lender with respect to any security for the
Obligations in which such holder is a participant. Borrower agrees that each
such holder may exercise any and all rights of banker's lien, set-off and

         --------                                                            
Section 18(i) herein, all Obligations shall be immediately due and payable and
this Agreement shall be deemed terminated; upon the occurrence and continuation
of any other of the Events of Default, Lender shall have the right to demand
repayment in full of all Obligations, whether or not otherwise due. Until all
Obligations have been fully satisfied, Lender shall retain its security interest
in all Collateral. Lender shall have, in addition to all other rights provided
herein, the rights and remedies of a secured party under the Uniform Commercial
Code, and under other applicable law, all other legal and equitable rights to
which Lender may be entitled, including without limitation, the right to take
immediate possession of the Collateral, to require Borrower to assemble the
Collateral, at Borrower's expense, and to make it available to Lender at a place
designated by Lender which is reasonably convenient to both parties and to enter
any of the premises of Borrower or wherever the Collateral shall be located,
with or without force or process of law, and to keep and store the same on said
premises until sold (and if said premises be the property of Borrower, Borrower
agrees not to charge Lender for storage thereof for a period up to at least
sixty (60) days after sale or disposition of said Collateral). Further, Lender
may, at any time or times after
<PAGE>
 
                                      -34-

default by Borrower, sell and deliver all Collateral held by or for Lender at
public or private sale for cash, upon credit or otherwise, at such prices and
upon such terms as Lender, in Lender's sole discretion, deems advisable or
Lender may otherwise recover upon the Collateral in any commercially reasonable
manner as Lender, in its sole discretion, deems advisable. Except as to that
part of the Collateral which is perishable or threatens to decline speedily in
nature or is of a type customarily sold on a recognized market, the requirement
of reasonable notice shall be met if such notice is received by Borrower at
Borrower's address as set forth herein, at least ten (10) days before the time
of the event of which notice is being given. Lender may be the purchaser at any
sale, if it is public. In connection with the exercise of the foregoing
remedies, Lender is granted permission to use all of Borrower's trademarks,
tradenames, tradestyles, patents, patent applications, licenses, franchises and
other proprietary rights which are used in connection with (a) Inventory for the
purpose of disposing of such Inventory and (b) Equipment for the purpose of
completing the manufacture of unfinished goods. The proceeds of sale shall be
applied first to all costs and expenses of sale, including attorneys' fees, and
second to the payment (in whatever order Lender elects) of all Obligations.
Lender will return any excess to Borrower and Borrower shall remain liable to
Lender for any deficiency.

     20. Waiver; Cumulative Remedies. Failure by Lender to exercise any right,
         ---------------------------                                          
remedy or option under this Agreement or any supplement hereto or any other
agreement between Borrower and Lender or delay by Lender in exercising the same,
will not operate as a waiver; no waiver by Lender will be effective unless it is
in writing and then only to the extent specifically stated. Lender's rights and
remedies under this Agreement will be cumulative and not exclusive of any other
right or remedy which Lender may have.

     21. Application of Payments.  Borrower irrevocably waives the right to
         -----------------------                                           
direct the application of any and all payments at any time or times hereafter
received by Lender from or on Borrower's behalf and Borrower hereby irrevocably
agrees that Lender shall have the continuing exclusive right to apply and
reapply any and all payments received at any time or times hereafter against
Borrower's Obligations hereunder in such manner as Lender may deem advisable
notwithstanding any entry by Lender upon any of Lender's books and records.

     22. Depository Accounts. Any payment received by Borrower on account of any
         -------------------                                                    
Receivables or Spare Parts Inventory shall be held by Borrower in trust for
Lender and Borrower shall promptly deliver same in kind to Lender or deposit all
such payments into a cash collateral account at such bank as Lender may
designate for application to payment of the Obligations.

     23. Lock Box Accounts. Borrower shall, at Lender's request, instruct all of
         -----------------                                                      
its Customers to make such payments on account of Receivables to an account
under Lender's dominion and
<PAGE>
 
                                      -35-

control at such bank in the United States as Lender may designate.

     24. Revival. Borrower further agrees that to the extent Borrower makes a
         -------                                                             
payment or payments to Lender, which payment or payments or any part thereof are
subsequently invalidated, declared to be fraudulent or preferential, set aside
and/or required to be repaid to a trustee, receiver or any other party under any
bankruptcy act, state or federal law, common law or equitable cause, then, to
the extent of such payment or repayment, the obligation or part thereof intended
to be satisfied shall be revived and continued in full force and effect as if
said payment had not been made.

     25. Notices. Any notice or request (except a request under Section 4
         -------                                                         
hereof) hereunder may be given to Borrower or Lender at the respective addresses

     THIS WARRANT AGREEMENT is entered into as of December 7, 1993, by and
between BNY Financial Corporation, a New York corporation, ("BNYFC"), and
WorldCorp, Inc., a Delaware corporation (the "Company").

     In furtherance of that certain Accounts Receivable Management and Security
Agreement between BNYFC and the Company of even date herewith (the "Loan
Agreement"), the Company agrees to grant to BNYFC warrants (the "Warrants") to
purchase shares of the Company's common stock, par value $ 1.00 per share
("Common Stock"), on the terms and conditions stated herein with Warrants to
purchase 250,000 shares of Common Stock being granted hereby.  Each Warrant
shall entitle the Holder thereof to purchase upon the exercise thereof one share
of the Company's  Common Stock as the number of shares may be adjusted from time
to time pursuant to Section 9 below (the shares of Common Stock issuable upon
exercise of the Warrants being referred to herein as "Warrant Shares").

     NOW THEREFORE, in consideration of the premises and the mutual agreements
herein and for other good and valuable consideration, the parties hereto agree
as follows:

     1.  Issuance and Exercisability of Warrants:  Form of Warrant Certificates.
         ---------------------------------------------------------------------- 

         (a)  BNYFC is hereby granted 250,000 Warrants, which Warrants will be
exercisable as of the date hereof through the Expiration Date as hereinafter
defined.  The Company will issue and deliver to BNYFC a warrant certificate or
warrant certificates (individually a "Warrant Certificate" and collectively the
"Warrant Certificates") for the 250,000 warrants.  The text of the Warrant
Certificate and of the form of election to purchase shares shall be
substantially as set forth in Exhibit A hereto.  The form of election to
                              ---------                                 
purchase shares shall be substantially as set forth in Exhibit B hereto.
                                                       ---------        

     2.  Registration.  The Warrant Certificates shall be numbered and shall be
         ------------                                                          
registered in a Warrant Register as they are issued.  The Company shall be
entitled to treat the registered holder of any Warrant Certificate on the
Warrant Register (the "Holder") as the owner in fact thereof for all purposes
and shall not be bound to recognize any equitable or other claim to or interest
in such Warrant on the part of any other person, and shall not be liable for any
registration of transfer of Warrant Certificates which are registered or to be
registered in the name of a fiduciary or the nominee of a fiduciary unless made
with the actual knowledge that a fiduciary or nominee is committing a breach of
trust in requesting such registration of transfer, or with knowledge of such
facts that its participation therein amounts to bad faith.  The Warrant
<PAGE>
 
Certificates to be issued to BNYFC hereunder shall be registered initially in
the name of "BNY Financial Corporation."

     3.  Exchange of Warrant Certificate.  Subject to any restriction upon
         -------------------------------                                  
transfer set forth in this Warrant Agreement, each Warrant Certificate may be
exchanged for another Warrant Certificate or Warrant Certificates of like tenor
and representing in the aggregate a like number of Warrants.  Any Holder
desiring to exchange a Warrant Certificate or Warrant Certificates shall make
such request in writing delivered to the Company, and shall surrender, properly
endorsed, the Warrant Certificate or Warrant Certificates to be so exchanged.
Thereupon, the Company shall execute and deliver to the person entitled thereto
a new Warrant Certificate or Warrant Certificates, as the case may be, as so
requested.

     4.  Transfer of Warrants.  Subject to compliance with state and federal
         --------------------                                               
securities laws and the terms and conditions hereof, BNYFC shall have the right
to sell, transfer, negotiate, assign or grant participation in all or any part
of BNYFC's rights and obligations under this Warrant Agreement or under any
Warrant Certificate.  The Warrant Certificates shall be transferable on the
books of the Company (the "Warrant Register") only upon delivery thereof duly
endorsed by the Holder or by his duly authorized attorney or representative, or
accompanied by proper evidence of succession, assignment or authority to
transfer.  In all cases of transfer by an attorney, the original power of
attorney, duly approved, or an official copy thereof, duly certified, shall be
deposited with the Company.  In case of transfer by executors, administrators,
guardians or other legal representatives, duly authenticated evidence of their
authority shall be produced, and may be required to be deposited with the
Company in its discretion.  Upon any registration of transfer, the Company shall
deliver a new Warrant Certificate or Warrant Certificates to the person entitled
thereto.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Company shall have no obligation to
cause Warrant Certificates to be transferred on its books to any person, unless
the Holder of such Warrant Certificates shall furnish to the Company evidence of
compliance with the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the "Act"), in
accordance with the provisions of Section 11 of this Warrant Agreement.  The
text of each new Warrant Certificate issued under Sections 3 or 4 and of the
form of election to purchase shares shall be set forth in Exhibit A hereto and
                                                          ---------           
shall be exchanged and transferred and subject to adjustment in the same manner
as if such new Warrant Certificate were the original Warrant Certificate issued
to the Holder.  Any Holder who transfers Warrants shall be responsible for and
pay all costs and expenses associated with such transfer of Warrants to its
transferee.
<PAGE>
 
     5.  Term and Compliance with Government Regulations.
         ------------------------------------------------

         5.1  Term of Warrants: Exercise of Warrants.
              ---------------------------------------

              (a) From and after each Warrant becomes exercisable, such
Warrant entitles the registered Holder thereof to purchase one share of Common
Stock at any time thereafter until 5:00 p.m. Washington, D.C. time, December
7, 1996 (the "Warrant Expiration Date"), at a purchase price of $6.15 per
share, as such number of shares may be adjusted from time to time pursuant to
Section 9 of this Warrant Agreement (such purchase price, as adjusted, being
referred to herein as the "Warrant Price").

              (b) Subject to the provisions of this Warrant Agreement, each
registered Holder of Warrant Certificates shall have the right, which may be
exercised as expressed in such Warrant Certificates, to purchase from the
Company (and the Company shall issue and sell to such registered Holder) the
number of fully paid and nonassessable shares of Common Stock specified in
such Warrant Certificates, upon surrender to the Company, or its duly
authorized agent, of such Warrant Certificates, with the form of election to
purchase duly filled in and signed, and upon payment to the Company of the
Warrant Price for the number of shares in respect of which such Warrants are
then exercised. Payment of such Warrant Price may be made in cash or by
certified or cashier's check. No adjustment shall be made for any dividends on
any shares of stock issuable upon exercise of a Warrant.

              (c) Upon such surrender of Warrant Certificates, and payment of
the Warrant Price as aforesaid, the Company shall issue and cause to be
delivered with all reasonable dispatch to or upon the written order of the
registered Holder of such Warrant Certificates and (subject to receipt of
evidence of compliance with the Act in accordance with the provisions of
Section 11 of this Warrant Agreement) in such name or names as such registered
Holder may designate, a certificate or certificates for the number of full
shares of stock so purchased upon the exercise of such Warrants.

              (d) If permitted by applicable law, such share certificate or
certificates shall be deemed to have been issued and any person so designated
to be named therein shall be deemed to have become a holder of record of such
shares as of the date of the surrender of such Warrant Certificates and
payment of the Warrant Price as aforesaid. The rights of purchase represented
by the Warrant Certificates shall be exercisable, at the election of
registered Holders thereof, either as an entirety or from time to time for
part only of the shares specified therein and, in the event that any Warrant
is exercised in respect of less than all of the shares specified therein at
any time prior to the date of

                                      3
<PAGE>
 
expiration of the Warrants, a new Warrant Certificate or Warrant Certificates
will be issued for the remaining whole number of shares specified in the Warrant
so surrendered.

     5.2 Compliance with Government Regulations.  The Company covenants that if
         --------------------------------------                                
any shares of Common Stock required to be reserved for purposes of exercise of
Warrants require, under any Federal or state law or applicable governing rule or
regulations of any national securities exchange, registration with or approval
of any governmental authority, or listing on any such national securities
exchange before such shares may be issued upon exercise, the Company will as
expeditiously as possible endeavor to cause such shares to be duly registered,
approved or listed on the relevant national securities exchange, as the case may
be.

     6.  Payment of Taxes.  The Company will pay all taxes (other than any
         ----------------                                                 
income taxes or other similar taxes), if any, attributable to the initial
issuance of the Warrants: provided, however, that the Company shall not be
                          --------  -------                               
required to pay any tax or taxes which may be payable in respect of any other
issuance or delivery of any Warrants or the issuance of certificates for Warrant
Shares, or the transfer thereof, and no such issuance, delivery or transfer
shall be made unless and until the person requesting such issuance or transfer
has paid to the Company the amount of any such tax, or has established, to the
satisfaction of the Company, that no such tax is payable or such tax has been
paid.

     7.  Mutilated or Missing Warrants.  In case any of the Warrant Certificates
         -----------------------------                                          
shall be mutilated, lost, stolen or destroyed, the Company shall issue and
deliver in exchange and substitution for and upon cancellation of the mutilated
Warrant Certificate, or in lieu of the substitution for the Warrant Certificate
lost, stolen or destroyed, a new Warrant Certificate of like tenor and
representing an equivalent right or interest, but only upon receipt of evidence
reasonably satisfactory to the Company of such loss, theft or destruction of
such Warrant Certificate and indemnity or bond, if requested, also reasonably
satisfactory to the Company.  An applicant for such substitute Warrant
Certificate shall also comply with such other reasonable regulations and pay
such other reasonable charges as the Company may prescribe.

     8.  Reservation of Warrant Shares.  There has been reserved out of the
         -----------------------------                                     
authorized and unissued shares of Common Stock, and the Company shall at all
times keep reserved out of its authorized and unissued shares of Common Stock, a
number of shares sufficient to provide for the exercise of the rights of
purchase represented by the Warrants, and the transfer agent for the Common
Stock ("Transfer Agent") and every subsequent Transfer Agent for any shares of
the Company's Common Stock issuable upon

                                      4
<PAGE>
 
the exercise of any of the rights of purchase aforesaid are hereby irrevocably
authorized and directed at all times until the Expiration Date to reserve such
number of authorized and unissued shares as shall be requisite for such purpose.
Concurrently with any corporate action that might result in an increase in the
number of shares for which any Warrant may be exercised pursuant to Section 9
below, the Company shall reserve out of its authorized and unissued Common Stock
the maximum number of additional shares that would be needed to provide for
exercise of all outstanding Warrants after any such increase.  The Company will
keep a copy of this Warrant Agreement on file with the Transfer Agent and with
every subsequent Transfer Agent for any shares of the Company's Common Stock
issuable upon the exercise of the rights of purchase represented by the
Warrants.  The Company will supply such Transfer Agent with duly executed stock
certificates for such purpose.  The Company will furnish to such Transfer Agent
a copy of all notices of adjustments, and certificates related thereto,
transmitted to each Holder pursuant to Section 9.7 hereof.  All Warrant
Certificates surrendered in the exercise of the rights thereby evidenced shall
be cancelled.

     9.  Adjustments.  The number and kind of securities purchasable upon the
         -----------                                                         
exercise of each Warrant and the Warrant Price shall be subject to adjustment
from time to time upon the happening of certain events, as hereinafter
described.

         9.1  Definitions.
              ----------- 

              (a) "Common Equity Securities" means any class or series of
Common Stock of the Company;

              (b) "Convertible Security" means any evidence of indebtedness of
the Company, any share of stock of the Company (other than Common Stock), or
any other security of the Company that is convertible into Common Stock;

              (c) "Option" means, subject to Section 9.11 hereof, any right,
option or warrant to purchase either Common stock or Convertible Securities;

              (d) "Other Security" means (i) any security of the Company
(other than Common Stock), (ii) any other security of the Company or any
successor entity which the Holder of a Warrant shall be entitled to purchase
at any time, or shall have purchased, upon exercise thereof in lieu of or in
addition to Common Stock, or (iii) any other security of the Company which at
any time shall be issuable or shall be been issued in exchange for, or as a
distribution with respect to, Common Stock or other securities of the Company;
and
              (e) "Additional Shares of Common Stock" means all shares of
Common Stock (or Other Securities) issued (or, pursuant 

                                      5
<PAGE>
 
to Section 9.3 below, deemed to be issued) by the Company after the date hereof.

         9.2 Adjustments of Warrant Price and Number of Warrant Shares in
             ------------------------------------------------------------
General. Upon the occurrence of any of the events described in this Section 9,
- -------
subject to Sections 9.10 and 9.11 hereof, the Warrant Price shall be adjusted
in the manner and as of the time set forth in this Section 9. Upon each
adjustment of such Warrant Price pursuant to this Section 9, the Holder of
each Warrant shall thereafter prior to the Expiration Date thereof be entitled
to purchase, at the Warrant Price resulting from such adjustment, the number
of Warrant Shares obtained by multiplying the Warrant Price in effect
immediately prior to such adjustment by the number of Warrant Shares issuable
upon exercise of such Warrant immediately prior to such adjustment and
dividing the product thereof by the Warrant Price resulting from such
adjustment. Notwithstanding any provision in this Warrant Agreement to the
contrary, however, no adjustment shall be made in the Warrant Price in respect
of the issuance of Additional Shares of Common Stock unless the consideration
per share for an Additional Share of Common Stock issued or deemed to be
issued by the Company is less than the lesser of the Closing Price or the
Warrant Price in effect immediately prior to such issuance.

         9.3  Issue of Additional Shares of Common Stock; Actual and Deemed.
              --------------------------------------------------------------

              (a)  Whenever the Company issues Additional Shares of Common Stock
(including Additional Shares of Common Stock deemed to be issued pursuant to
subsection 9.3(b) below) without consideration or for a consideration per share
less than the lesser of the Closing Price or the Warrant Price in effect on the
date of and immediately prior to such issuance, such Warrant Price shall be
reduced, concurrently with such issuance, to a price (calculated to the nearest
cent) determined by multiplying such Warrant Price by the sum of the number of
shares of Common Stock outstanding immediately prior to such issuance and the
number of shares of Common Stock which the aggregate consideration received by
the Company for the total number of Additional Shares of Common Stock so issued
would purchase at such Warrant Price, and dividing the result by the sum of the
number of shares of Common Stock outstanding immediately prior to such issuance
and the actual number of such Additional Shares of Common Stock so issued.  For
purposes of this calculation, all shares of Common Stock issuable upon
conversion of outstanding Convertible Securities shall be deemed to be
outstanding, and immediately after any Additional Shares of Common Stock are
deemed issued pursuant to subsection 9.3(b) below, such Additional Shares of
Common Stock shall be deemed to be outstanding.

                                      6
<PAGE>
 
              (b) In the event that the Company, after the date hereof, issues
any Options or Convertible Securities, subject to Section 9.11 hereof, then
the maximum number of shares (as set forth in the instrument governing such
Options or Convertible Securities, without regard to any provisions contained
therein for a subsequent adjustment of such number) of Common Stock issuable
upon the exercise of such Options or, in the case of Convertible Securities
and Options therefor, such number of shares of Common Stock into which such
Convertible Securities may be converted, shall be deemed to be Additional
Shares of Common Stock issued as of the time of issuance, provided that
                                                          -------- ----
Additional Shares of Common Stock shall not be deemed have been issued unless
the consideration per share (determined pursuant to subsection 9.5(a) below)
of such Additional Shares of Common Stock would be less than the lesser of the
Closing Price or the Warrant Price in effect on the date of and immediately
prior to such issuance. Throughout this Section 9, the terms "issue" and
"issuance" and all related forms thereof, when used in reference to issuance
of Additional Shares of Common Stock, include reference to deemed issuance
under this subsection 9.3(b), except where the context requires otherwise.

          9.4 Readjustment. In any case in which Additional Shares of Common
               ------------                                                    
Stock are deemed or have been deemed issued in connection with the issuance of
Options or Convertible Securities, certain subsequent events shall require
further adjustment of the Warrant Price as set forth in this Section 9.4.

              (a) No further adjustment in the Warrant Price shall be made as a
result of the subsequent issuance of any Convertible Security or share of
Common Stock upon the exercise of any such Options or the conversion of any
such Convertible Securities.

              (b) If such Options or Convertible Securities by their terms
provide, with the passage of time or otherwise, for any decrease in the
consideration payable to the Company, or increase in the number of shares of
Common Stock issuable upon the exercise, conversion, or exchange thereof, the
Warrant Price computed upon the original issuance thereof, and any subsequent
adjustments based thereon, shall, upon any such decrease or increase becoming
effective, be recomputed to reflect such decrease or increase insofar as it
affects such Options or the rights of conversion or exchange under such
Convertible Securities. Notwithstanding any provision to the contrary in any
instrument governing such Options or Convertible Securities, however, there
shall be no such decrease or increase as a result of any recomputation of the
Warrant Price pursuant to this subsection 9.4(b).

              (c) Upon the expiration of any Options or rights of conversion or
exchange under any Convertible Securities, if

                                      7
<PAGE>
 
any thereof shall not have been exercised, the Warrant Price shall, upon such
expiration, be readjusted and shall thereafter be such as it would have been had
it been originally adjusted (or had the original adjustment not been required,
as the case may be) as if (A) the only shares of Common Stock so issued were the
shares of Common Stock, if any, actually issued or sold upon the exercise of
such Options or conversions or exchange rights under such Convertible Securities
and (B) such shares of Common Stock, if any, were issued or sold for the
consideration actually received by the Company upon such exercise plus the
aggregated consideration, if any, actually received by the Company for the
issuance, sale or grant of all of such Options or conversion or exchange rights
under such Convertible Securities whether or not exercised, provided, further,
                                                            --------  ------- 
that no such readjustment shall have the effect of increasing the Warrant Price
by an amount in excess of the amount of the adjustment initially made, in
respect to the issuance, sale or grant of such Options, or conversion or
exchange rights under such Convertible Securities.

         9.5  Determination of Consideration.  For purposes of this Section 9,
              ------------------------------                                    
the consideration received or deemed to be received by the Company for the
issuance or deemed issuance of any Additional Shares of Common Stock shall be
determined according to this Section 9.5, but shall not include interest
accrued and unpaid on Convertible Securities.

              (a) Options and Convertible Securities. The consideration per
                  ----------------------------------
share received by the Company for Additional Shares of Common Stock deemed to
have been issued pursuant to subsection 9.3(b) relating to Options and
Convertible Securities shall be determined by dividing

              (x)  the total amount, if any, received by the Company as
              consideration for the issuance of such Options or Convertible
              Securities, plus the minimum aggregate amount of additional
              consideration (as set forth in the instruments relating thereto,
              without regard to any provision contained therein for a
              subsequent adjustment of such consideration) payable to the
              Company upon the exercise of such Options or the conversion of
              such Convertible Securities, the exercise of such Options for
              Convertible Securities and the conversion of such Convertible
              Securities, by

              (y) the maximum number of shares of Common Stock (as set forth
              in the instruments relating thereto, without regard to any
              provision contained therein for a subsequent adjustment of such
              number) issuable upon the exercise of such Options or the
              conversion of such Convertible Securities, or, in the case of
              Options for Convertible Securities,

                                      8
<PAGE>
 
              the exercise of such Options for Convertible Securities and the
              conversion of such Convertible Securities.

              (b) Stock Dividends and Stock Subdivisions.  Any Additional
                  --------------------------------------                 
Shares of Common Stock issued or deemed to have been issued pursuant to any
stock dividend or stock subdivision shall be deemed to have been issued for no
consideration.


          9.6  Stock Dividends and Stock Splits.
               -------------------------------- 

               (a)  In the event the Company at any time or from time to time on
or after the date hereof shall, subject to Section 9.11 hereof, pay any dividend
on securities payable in Common Stock, or effect a subdivision of the
outstanding shares of Common Stock into a greater number of shares, Additional
Shares of Common Stock shall be deemed to have been issued for no consideration:

              (i)  in the case of any such dividend, immediately after the close
              of business on the record date for determining the holders of any
              class of securities entitled to received such dividend, or

              (ii) in the case of any such subdivision, at the close of
              business on the date immediately prior to the date upon which
              such corporate action becomes effective.

In either case the number of Additional Shares of Common Stock deemed to have
been issued shall be the difference between the number of outstanding shares of
Common Stock immediately before such dividend or subdivision and the number of
shares of Common Stock outstanding immediately thereafter.

              (b)  In the event the Company at any time or from time to time
after the date hereof shall pay any dividend on securities payable in
Convertible Securities, an adjustment shall be made as if such dividend were an
issuance, for no consideration, of the total number of Convertible Securities
distributed in such dividend.

          9.7  Adjustments for Combinations or Consolidation of Common Stock.
               -------------------------------------------------------------  
In the event the outstanding shares of Common Stock shall be combined or
consolidated into a lesser number of shares of Common Stock, the Warrant Price
in effect immediately prior to such combination or consolidation, concurrently
with the effectiveness of such combination or consolidation, shall be
proportionately increased.

                                      9
<PAGE>
 
          9.8  Adjustment for Merger or Reorganization, etc.  In case of any
               ---------------------------------------------                
consolidation or merger of the Company with or into another corporation or the
conveyance of substantially all of the assets of the Company to another
corporation, each Warrant hereunder, without any further act or the execution of
any further instrument whatsoever, shall become a warrant to purchase or
receive, at the Warrant Price, such shares of stock or other securities or
property as a holder of the number of Warrant Shares purchasable upon exercise
of such Warrant immediately prior to such consolidation, merger, or conveyance
would have been entitled to upon such consolidation, merger or conveyance, and
appropriate adjustment (as reasonably determined by the Board of Directors of
the Company or the surviving corporation, as the case may be) shall be made in
the application of the provisions herein set forth with respect to the rights of
the holder of such Warrant, to the end that such provisions (including
provisions with respect to changes in and other adjustments of the Warrant
Price) shall thereafter be applicable, as nearly as reasonably may be, in
relation to any shares of stock or other property thereafter deliverable upon
exercise of such Warrant.  The Company shall not effect any such consolidation,
merger or conveyance unless prior to the consummation thereof the successor (if
other than the Company) resulting from such consolidation or merger, or the
transferee of the assets, as the case may be, shall have assumed by written
instrument the obligation to deliver to each holder of a Warrant such shares of
stock or other securities or property as, in accordance with the foregoing
provisions and the provision of each Warrant, such holder may be entitled to
purchase or receive.

          9.9  Adjustment of Warrant Price Upon Issuance of Other Securities.
               -------------------------------------------------------------  
In the event Other Securities shall be issued or shall become subject to
issuance upon the conversion of any shares (or Other Securities) of the Company
for a consideration such as to diminish the aggregate fair market value of the
Warrant Shares purchasable upon exercise of any Warrant, adjustments of the
Warrant Price shall be made as nearly as possible in the matter provided in this
Section 9 so as to maintain the aggregate fair market value of such Warrant
Shares to the extent reasonably possible.

          9.10 Minimum Adjustment.  Notwithstanding anything in this Section 9
               ------------------                                             
to the contrary, the Company shall not be required to give effect to any
adjustment in the Warrant Price unless and until the cumulative effect of one or
more adjustments, determined as above provided, shall have required a change in
the Warrant Price by at least one cent ($.01), but when the cumulative effect of
one or more adjustments so determined shall be to change the Warrant Price by at
least one cent ($.01) such cumulative change in the Warrant Price shall
thereupon be given effect.

                                     10
<PAGE>
 
          9.11  No Adjustment.  No adjustment in the Warrant Price shall be
                -------------                                              
made:

              (a)  for a change in the par value of the Warrant Shares; or
 
              (b)  in the case of the Warrants issued pursuant hereto; or

              (c)  as a result of shares of Common Stock or Convertible
Securities being issued upon conversion or exchange of any Options, warrants, or
Convertible Securities of the Company outstanding on the date hereof; or

              (d)  solely on account of any warrants issued or deemed to be
issued in connection with an adjustment pursuant to the antidilution provisions
of any outstanding warrants of the Company; or

              (e)  in the case the Company issues or distributes to each Holder
of Warrants the Options or Convertible Securities which each Holder of Warrants
would have been entitled to receive had the Warrants been exercised prior to the
happening of such event or the record date with respect thereto.

              (f)  in the case of shares of Common Stock or Convertible
Securities pursuant to any employee or director incentive or benefit plan or
stock ownership plan, agreement or arrangement, including any employment,
severance or consulting agreement of the Company or any subsidiary or affiliate
of the Company heretofore or hereafter adopted or approved, as the case may be,
and any modifications to, or amendments of, any such plans, agreements or
arrangements.

          For the purpose of any computation under this Section 9, the term
"Closing Price" on any day shall mean the last reported sales price regular way
on such day or, in case no such reported sale takes place on such day, the
average of the closing bid and asked prices regular way for such day, in each
case on the principal national securities exchange on which the shares of Common
Stock are listed or admitted to trading or, if not listed or admitted to trading
on any national securities exchange, the average of the closing bid and asked
prices of the Common Stock in the over-the-counter market as reported by NASDAQ
or any comparable system, or, in the absence of one or more such quotations, the
average of the closing bid and asked prices as furnished by any New York Stock
Exchange member firm selected from time to time by the Company for this purpose.
The term "Trading Day" shall mean a date on which the New York Stock Exchange
(or any successor to such exchange) is open for the transaction of business.

          9.12  Notice of Adjustment.  Whenever the number of Warrant Shares
                --------------------                                        
purchasable upon the exercise of each Warrant or the Warrant Price of such
Warrant Shares is adjusted, as herein provided, the Company shall promptly mail
by first class, postage prepaid, to each Holder notice of such adjustment or
adjustments and a certificate of a firm of independent certified public
accountants selected by the Board of Directors of the Company (who may be the
regular accountants employed by the Company) setting forth the number of Warrant
Shares purchasable upon the exercise of each Warrant and the Warrant Price of
such Warrant shares after such adjustment, setting forth a brief statement of
the facts requiring such adjustment and setting forth the computation by which
such adjustment was made.

          9.13 Statement on Warrant Certificates.  Irrespective of any
               ---------------------------------                      
adjustments in the Warrant Price or the number or kind of shares purchasable
upon the exercise of the Warrants, Warrant Certificates theretofore or
thereafter issued may continue to express the same price and number and kind of
shares as are stated in the Warrant Certificates initially issuable pursuant to
this Warrant Agreement.
 
     10.  No Fractional Interests.  No fractional Warrant Shares, or cash or
          -----------------------                                           
other property in lieu thereof, shall be issued upon the exercise of Warrants.

     11.  Registration under the Securities Act of 1933 and Registration Rights.
          --------------------------------------------------------------------- 

          (a)  BNYFC represents and warrants to the Company that BNYFC will not
dispose of any of its Warrants or Warrant Shares except pursuant to (i) an
effective registration statement under the Act, (ii) Rule 144 under the Act (or
any similar rule under the Act relating to the disposition of securities), or
(iii) an opinion of counsel that an exemption from such registration is
available.
 
     12.  Certificates to Bear Legends.  The Warrants shall be subject to a
          ----------------------------                                     
stop-transfer order and the Warrant Certificates therefor shall bear the
following legend by which each Holder shall be bound:


          THE WARRANTS REPRESENTED BY THIS CERTIFICATE AND THE SHARES OF COMMON
     STOCK (OR OTHER SECURITIES) ISSUABLE UPON EXERCISE THEREOF MAY NOT BE
     OFFERED OR SOLD EXCEPT PURSUANT TO (i) AN EFFECTIVE REGISTRATION STATEMENT
     UNDER THE SECURITIES ACT OF 1933, AS AMENDED, (ii) TO THE EXTENT
     APPLICABLE, RULE 144 UNDER SUCH ACT (OR ANY SIMILAR RULE UNDER SUCH ACT
     RELATING TO THE DISPOSITION OF SECURITIES), OR (iii) AN OPINION OF COUNSEL
     THAT AN EXEMPTION FROM REGISTRATION UNDER SUCH ACT IS AVAILABLE.

                                     12
<PAGE>
 
          The Warrant Shares (or Other Securities) issued upon exercise of the
Warrants shall be subject to a stop-transfer order and the Warrant Certificate
or Warrant Certificates evidencing any such Warrant Shares (or Other Securities)
shall bear a legend in substantially the following form:

          THE SHARES REPRESENTED BY THIS CERTIFICATE MAY NOT BE OFFERED OR SOLD
     EXCEPT PURSUANT TO (i) AN EFFECTIVE REGISTRATION STATEMENT UNDER THE
     SECURITIES ACT OF 1933, AS AMENDED, (ii) TO THE EXTENT APPLICABLE, RULE 144
     UNDER SUCH ACT (OR ANY SIMILAR RULE UNDER SUCH ACT RELATING TO THE
     DISPOSITION OF SECURITIES), OR (iii) AN OPINION OF COUNSEL THAT AN
     EXEMPTION FROM REGISTRATION UNDER SUCH ACT IS AVAILABLE.

          The Company covenants that it shall issue a new Warrant Certificate or
Warrant Certificates without the legends referred to above, evidencing the
Warrants or the Warrant Shares or Other Securities issued upon exercise of the
Warrants, in exchange for a Warrant Certificate or Warrant Certificates
evidencing such Warrants, Warrant Shares or Other Securities, and will remove
the stop-transfer order, in the event the Holder of such Warrants, Warrant
Shares or Other Securities shall deliver to the Company an opinion of counsel
reasonably satisfactory to the Company that an exemption from registration under
the Act is available with respect to such Warrants, Warrant Shares or Other
Securities.

     13.  Registration Rights.  The Company and BNYFC agree that their
          -------------------                                         
respective rights and obligations with respect to registration of the Warrants
and Warrant Shares under the Act are as hereinafter set forth.

          13.1 Registration of Warrants and Warrant Shares.  If the Company at
               -------------------------------------------                    
any time proposes to register any of its Common Stock under the Act for its own
account or for the account of any Holder or any other person (other than (i) any
registration of an offering solely to employees of the Company or its
subsidiaries or (ii) any registration relating to a merger or other business
combination transaction), it shall promptly give written notice to the Holder of
its intention to do so, and the Company shall include in such registration,
subject to Section 13.2 hereof, all Warrant Shares that the Holder shall specify
in a written notice delivered to the Company within 30 days after its receipt of
the Company's notice of the proposed filing of the registration statement,
provided that the Company shall not be required to include in such registration
- --------                                                                       
any Warrant Shares that a Holder shall so specify if, in the unqualified opinion
of counsel to the Company reasonably acceptable to the Holder so specifying,
registration under the Act is not required for the transfer of such Warrant
Shares in the manner requested by such Holder or that a post-effective amendment
to an existing registration

                                     13
<PAGE>
 
statement would be legally sufficient for such transfer and the Company shall
have obtained such a post-effective amendment.
 
          13.2 Exclusion.  If the proposed or required registration is to be
               ---------                                                    
underwritten (whether on a "best efforts" or a "firm commitment" basis), the
managing underwriter shall have the right to exclude all or any part of the
Warrant Shares of the Holder if the underwriter advises the Company in writing
that it reasonably believes that such securities should be withdrawn therefrom.
Any exclusion of Warrant Shares shall be made pro rata among the Holder and all
other persons (other than the Company) participating in the registration in
proportion to the respective number of Warrant Shares or other securities for
which such Holder and each such other person have requested registration.

          13.3 Further Obligations and Conditions Relating to Registration of
               --------------------------------------------------------------
Shares.  Registration of Warrant Shares pursuant to Section 13.1 shall be

subject to the following:

               (i) Information, Documents, Assignments, etc.  The Holder shall
                   -----------------------------------------                  
               furnish to the Company such information as the Company may
               reasonably request and as shall be required in connection with
               any registration, qualification or compliance referred to herein.
               The Company shall permit counsel for the Holder to participate in
               meetings in connection with the preparation of any registration
               statement prepared pursuant to Section 13.1 (but the Holder shall
               be under no obligation to participate in any such meetings and
               shall incur no liability for its failure to so participate).
               Before filing any such registration statement or amendment or
               supplement thereto, the Company shall furnish to the Holder
               copies of all such documents proposed to be filed.  The Company
               shall promptly deliver to the Holder copies of each such
               registration statement and each amendment or supplement thereto
               as filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission ("SEC").
               The Company shall furnish to the Holder the number of
               prospectuses, offering circulars or other documents, and all
               amendments or supplements thereto, incident to each registration,
               qualification or compliance as from time to time the Holder may
               reasonably request.

               (ii) Underwriting Agreement.  The Company and the Holder shall
                    ----------------------                                   
               enter into an underwriting agreement in customary form with
               respect to the registration of Warrant Shares pursuant to Section
               13.1 hereof with the underwriter or underwriters selected for

                                     14
<PAGE>
 
               such underwriting by the Company, which underwriting agreement
               shall provide for the completion of the offering within 90 days
               of the effective date of the registration statement, provided,
                                                                    -------- 
               however, that such underwriting agreement shall not require any
               -------                                                        
               Holder to indemnify the underwriter for any losses, claims,
               damages, liabilities or actions except those arising out of or
               based on an untrue statement or omission made in reliance upon
               and in conformity with written information furnished to the
               underwriter by such Holder for specific use in the registration
               statement, prospectus, preliminary prospectus, amendment or
               supplement.

               (iii) Filing of Amendments.  The Company shall file such
                     --------------------                              
               amendments and supplements to the registration statement and the
               related prospectus and take such other action as may be necessary
               to keep the registration statement effective and to comply with
               the Act for such period, not exceeding 90 days from the original
               effective date of the registration statement.

               (iv) Blue Sky.  The Company shall do any and all acts and things
                    --------                                                   
               which may be necessary or advisable to enable the Holder to
               consummate the sale, transfer or other disposition of Warrant
               Shares and take such action under the securities laws of such
               states as the Holder shall reasonably request, provided, however,
                                                              --------  ------- 
               that the Company shall not be required to file any general
               consent to service of process, to qualify to do business as a
               foreign corporation, or to otherwise subject itself to taxation
               in connection with any such action, in any state.

               (v) Expenses.  The Company and the Holder shall share all of the
                   --------                                                    
               costs of registration and all related blue sky costs, including,
               but not limited to, printing expenses, registration and filing
               fees, and fees and disbursements of counsel and accountants for
               the Company (subject, however, to subsection (vi) below), except
               that the Holder shall pay the fees and selling commissions
               applicable to its Warrant Shares and the Company (or others)
               shall pay the fees and selling commissions applicable to all
               other shares of Common Stock being sold.  Such sharing shall be
               in the proportion that the number of Warrant Shares being so
               registered for the Holder bears to the total number of other
               shares of Common Stock being

                                     15
<PAGE>
 
               so registered.  Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of this
               subsection, the Company shall not be required to pay any of the
               costs or such expenses with respect to registration statements
               prepared pursuant to Section 13.1 hereof unless the aggregate
               value of the total number of Warrant Shares to be registered,
               including all Common Stock to be registered by another person,
               exceeds $2,000,000.  In the event that the Company shall not be
               required to pay any of such costs or expenses, each person
               participating in the registration shall bear its pro rata portion
               of such costs or expenses.  The aggregate value of the total
               number of Warrant Shares and Common Stock to be registered shall
               be determined by multiplying the total number of Warrant Shares
               and Common Stock to be registered by the average of the daily
               Closing Price (as defined in Section 9.11 hereof) of the Common
               Stock for 20 consecutive Trading Days commencing 30 Trading Days
               before the date on which the Holder received from the Company the
               notice of proposed registration referred to in Section 13.1
               hereof.

               audited financial statements at the request of the Holder other
               than those statements customarily prepared at the end of its
               fiscal year, unless the Holder shall agree to reimburse the
               Company of the out-of-pocket costs incurred by the Company in the
               preparation of such other audited financial statements.  The
               Company shall, however, furnish, without charge, copies of all
               such unaudited financial statements as the Holder shall
               reasonably request.

               (vii)  Indemnification.  The Company shall indemnify and hold

               controlling person of the Holder, and each underwriter for the
               Holder against any losses, claims, damages or liabilities to
               which the Holder, controlling person or underwriter may become
               subject under the Act or otherwise, insofar as such losses,
               claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof)
               shall arise out of or be based upon any untrue or allegedly
               untrue statement of any material fact contained in the
               registration statement, upon any related prospectus or
               preliminary prospectus or any amendment or supplement to the
               registration statement or any prospectus or preliminary
               prospectus or upon the

               expenses reasonably incurred by the Holder, controlling person or
               underwriter in connection with investigating or defending against
               any such loss, claim, damage, liability or action; provided,
                                                                  --------

               controlling person or underwriter for any losses, claims,
               damages, liabilities or actions insofar as the same shall arise
               out of or be based upon any such untrue statement or omission
               made in reliance upon and in conformity with written information
               furnished by the Holder, controlling person or underwriter
               seeking indemnification hereunder to the Company for use in the
               registration statement, prospectus, preliminary prospectus,
               amendment or supplement.  The Holder and each underwriter for the
               Holder shall similarly indemnify and hold harmless the Company
               and its controlling persons and underwriters and all persons
               participating in the registration against any such losses,
               claims, damages, liabilities or actions but only insofar as the
               same shall arise out of or be based upon any untrue statement or
               omission made in reliance upon and in conformity with written
               information furnished by such indemnifying person to the Company
               for use in the registration statement, prospectus, preliminary
               prospectus, amendment or supplement.

contribution in circumstances in which the indemnification provided for in
Section 13.3 above is due in accordance with its terms but is for any reason
held by a court to be unavailable from the Company or the Holder, the Company
and each Holder shall contribute to the aggregate losses, claims, damages, and
liabilities (or actions in respect thereof) to which any Holder or the Company
may be subject in such proportion so that the indemnifying party is responsible
for that portion of such losses, claims, charges, and liabilities for which its
has agreed to indemnify the indemnitee pursuant to Section 13.3 above, provided
that in no event shall the indemnifying party be required to contribute to any
losses, claims, damages or liabilities that arise solely out of or are based
upon written information furnished by such indemnitee for specific use in the
registration statement, prospectus, preliminary prospectus, amendment or
supplement.

days in any case specified in paragraphs (a) and (b) above) prior to the date
fixed as a record date or the date of closing and transfer books for the
determination of the stockholders entitled to such dividend, distribution, or

2.  PRICING
    -------

     a.  Contract Line Item Numbers (CLINs) 0001 and 0002 shall be priced as
follows:

          (1)  Airlift services shall be paid at the price established for each
SUBCLIN.  Such price shall be determined in accordance with AMC Uniform
Negotiated Rates and Rules incorporated by reference for International Long- and
Short-Range Commercial Augmentation.  AMC will continue to conduct an annual
rate review in accordance with the Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) between the
contractors and AMC.  Mileages will be determined in accordance with the
Commercial Operations Integrated System (COINS).  Those missions that cannot be
flown at the mileages calculated in COINS due to circumnavigating certain
communist countries, will be paid override mileage.  Override mileage will be
determined on actual flight plans and mutually agreed to.

          (2)   CAT A cargo transportation services shall be paid at the one-way
CAT B

B-2
<PAGE>
 
ton mile rate, provided that, if a carrier has on file a tariff available to
the general public for equivalent unrestricted service which is less than the
above rate, then the tariff rate shall apply. In either case, the price shall
be calculated in accordance with the FY94 AMC Uniform Rates and Rules for long-
range airlift).

          (3)  The prices are subject to adjustment for variances in fuel prices
as set forth in the AMC Final Uniform Negotiated Rates and Rules Appendix A.

          (4)  When requirements for SAAMs or Exercises exceed the 'Maximum
Standard Payloads' as set forth in Appendix A of the Rates and Rules, the
Government shall negotiate an ACL taking into consideration the Gross Take Off
Weight (as certified by the carrier), desired ACL and mission requirements.
Ferry on SAAMs or Exercises will be paid at the standard ACL or where allowable
cabin loads for various aircraft types are less, the government shall pay ferry
for the lower number of seats.

          (5)  CLIN 0005AA:  The following additional charges may be recognized
under the terms of this contract:  Excess Baggage Charges (Scheduled Service);
Transportation Tax; Head Tax; Custom Charges as outlined in 19 USC 58c;
Immigration Charges as outlined in 8 USC 1356(d); Passenger Facility Charge
Imposed by Commercial Airports, approved by the FAA under the Aviation, Safety,
and Capacity Expansion Act of 1990; and Federal Inspection Service fee.

          (6)  CLIN 0005AC - (Demurrage) will be paid on completed cargo
missions when departure is delayed over 3 hours beyond scheduled block time and
the delay is Government controlled (See paragraph F-7).  Payment of delays of
fractions of an hour will be calculated using normal rounding procedures, i.e.,
29 minutes or less will be dropped, 30 minutes or more will be rounded to the
next whole hour.  Charges are as follows:

<TABLE>

          <S>           <C> <C> 
          (1)  B747     -   $1246 per hour
          (2)  DC-10    -   $1038 per hour
          (3)  DC-8     -   $ 623 per hour
          (4)  B707     -   $ 505 per hour
</TABLE>

    b.  CLIN 0003 is included in the AMC determined rate and shall not be priced
separately.

    c.  CLIN 0004 (excluding aeromedical) shall be priced as follows:

          (1)  Prices for airlift services during CRAF activation, Stage I, II
and III and during Commander, AMC, determined periods where volunteered
airlift is used in lieu of CRAF activated airlift shall be determined in the
same manner as for CLINs 0001 and 0002, except that one-way cargo and
passenger missions will be priced at the percentage of the round trip rate,
identified as CRAF one-way rate, in the AMC Negotiated Uniform Rates and
Rules.

          (2)  For long-range international aircraft called up (See Atch 9,
                                                     --------- 
para 2.18) under CRAF activation Stages I, II or III, there will be a
guaranteed average daily utilization of 8 hours flight time. If an aircraft
fails to achieve the guaranteed utilization, the contractor will be entitled
to additional compensation due to under utilization.

          (a)  The equation for computing compensation for under utilization is:

                   (guaranteed hours - actual hours) x 500 mph x ACL x rate =
compensation.

                   1. Flight time (actual hours) shall include all revenue
                   -
hours including paid-ferry and any commercial flights operated during the CRAF
activation.

B-3
<PAGE>
 
                   2.  Actual hours will be increased by 8 hours for each time
                   -
an aircraft is unavailable to the Government for contractor controllable
reasons.

                   3.  The rate will be based on the AMC Negotiated Uniform
                   -
Rate minus any costs not expected to be incurred (i.e., fuel, meals,
maintenance).

                   4.  The underutilized hours will be converted to miles
                   -
using an average speed of 500 mph.

EXAMPLE:

     (i)  Tail number N123 with an ACL of 326 PAX is activated on the 5th of
the month.

     (ii)  The aircraft operated for 100 flight hours for the remainder of the
month including 10 commercial hours.

     (iii)  Guaranteed utilization = 200 hours (25 days x 8 hrs)

     (iv)  Actual utilization = 100 hours

     (v)  Underutilized hours = 100 hours

     (vi)  100 hours x 500 mph = 50,000 miles x 326 ACL = 16,300,000 seat
miles x .045 (actual rate to be determined = $733,500 compensation earned for
the month.

            (b)  The procedure for determining under utilization and
compensation will be based on documentation provided by the contractor.
Contractor will report to AMC at the end of each month total hours flown for
each called up aircraft, the number of contractor controllable delays, hours
flown in commercial service, and hours flown in AMC service. Compensation for
under utilization will be accomplished at the end of the contract period or
upon CRAF deactivation, whichever comes first. Contractors must provide cost
data to determine the rate as soon as possible.

            (c)  Additionally, should the long-range international aircraft
called up, as defined in Attachment 9, para 2.14. under CRAF activation Stages
I, II, III not be required for the 30-day minimum guaranteed utilization
period or not be required for all or a portion of the 15 days between
notification and official release from call up, they will be compensated for
not being utilized at an amount not to exceed that calculated as provided in
paragraph 2(b) above. Carriers are obligated to utilize their best efforts to
obtain commercial business to minimize government costs.

            (d)  Prices for airlift called up under CRAF activation Stages I,
II, and III may be adjusted by negotiation between the contractor and the
government pursuant to the procedures in the CHANGES clause. The Memorandum of
Understanding (MOU) between the contractor and AMC shall serve as the
guideline for establishing prices and adjustments thereto. In establishing
such prices, it shall be presumed, unless the contractor presents evidence
establishing that an adjustment to the rate of compensation is appropriate,
that prices computed in accordance with the AMC Negotiated Uniform Rate
applied to the mileage set forth in COINS for the shortest route over which
the type of aircraft involved operated, constitutes equitable prices for such
services. However, consideration will be given but not limited to evidence so
presented by the contractor for aircraft called up which reflect reasonable
incurred cost outside the peacetime rate associated with call-up aircraft
under CRAF activation. Examples of such costs are:

                   1.  Additional per diem expenses incurred to relocate
                   -
personnel required to assist in the flow of CRAF activated aircraft.

B-4
<PAGE>
 
                   2.  Additional security expenses for the safety of aircraft
                   -
and crew.

     d.  The government shall also have the right at its sole option to order
other airlift service under the contract in accordance with and at the rate
specified by the contractor for service to the public which will, in the
judgment of the contracting officer, meet the government needs. In addition,
the government may, for airlift service not covered by the AMC Uniform Rates
and Rules, establish rates by negotiation.

3.  MINIMUM GUARANTEE
    -----------------

The total minimum guarantee to be awarded under this contract will be those
dollars negotiated and awarded for each contract as the fixed award under CLIN
0001.  This minimum can be satisfied by a combination of fixed and expansion
award.

PART I - THE SCHEDULE

SECTION C - DESCRIPTION/SPECS/WORK STATEMENT

1.  GENERAL DESCRIPTION OF SERVICE

          a.  Contractor shall provide international long and/or short range
airlift services.  Services are to include passenger, cargo and/or aeromedical
transportation as stated in SECTION B and in accordance with the specifications
set forth in Attachments 1 through 7, 9 through 11 and Exhibit A.  Cargo (and/or
baggage during CRAF operations) may include hazardous material classes 1 through
9 as defined in the International Air Transport Association Dangerous Goods
Regulation.  Passenger service shall in no event be less than that afforded
economy class passengers, commensurate with customs, practices and standard
procedures of particular airports and countries, and this contract.

          b.  Contractor shall operate in accordance with Federal Aviation
Administration (FAA) approved manuals, (applicable copies of which shall be
aboard each aircraft), appropriate provisions of Federal Aviation Regulation
(FAR) 121, applicable International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO)
recommended practices and standard procedures, appropriate emergency response
guidebook/manual, and this contract.

          c.  The Contractor, in furnishing services hereunder shall provide,
except as otherwise specifically set forth in the contract, all personnel,
facilities, supplies, and equipment to support and perform air transportation
services called for under this contract.  Contractor shall be self-supporting at
all bases of operation.

2.  CONTRACT REQUIREMENTS

          a.  The contractor (or in the case of a Contractor Team Arrangement,
the entity of the Contractor Team Arrangement operating the aircraft) shall
conform and adhere to these requirements throughout the term of the contract:

            (1)  Shall meet requirements set forth in AMC FARS 5352.247-1001
incorporated in Section H, paragraph 17.

            (2)  Shall participate in the Civil Reserve Air Fleet (CRAF) Program
and maintain a minimum of 15% of the aircraft in their wide-body equivalent
fleet.

            (3)  The Contractor shall provide and maintain a minimum of four
qualified cockpit crews per aircraft as required by Attachment 9 of this
contract, exclusive of those with Reserve or National Guard commitments, and
material to enable at least 10 hours per day utilization of each aircraft as
required in Attachment 9.  Cockpit crew members must be US. citizens and
eligible for a SECRET clearance.  The Contractor shall submit a list of the
names of the crew members within 15 days if requested by the Contracting
Officer.

               (a)  Contractors who do not have sufficient crews for all of
their aircraft may arrange with other contractors for the necessary crews.
Contractor may employ such crews on a full-time basis; however, arrangements
could include standby or temporary crews as long as their names appear on the
contractor's list of current and qualified crew members provided to the FAA.

               (b)  In the event cockpit crews are obtained through contractual
arrangement with another contractor, they must be US citizens and eligible for a
Secret clearance.  If during any period of contract performance, including
activation of CRAF, the contractor for reasons beyond its control is unable to
provide either the personnel or the material necessary to operate 10 hours per
day, it will still be obligated to provide the aircraft listed on Attachment 8,
and the Government shall have the right to operate such aircraft.  The exercise
of such right is contingent upon the provision by the Government of adequate
financial protection to the contractor/carrier and any lessor(s).  In such
event, the compensation, which would otherwise be paid to the 

C-1
<PAGE>
 
Contractor under the terms of this contract, shall be reduced by the amount
which the Contracting Officer finds to represent the services and material not
furnished by the Contractor, and related overhead and profit.

            (4)  The Contractor shall at all times during the contract period,
including any extension described elsewhere in the contract, maintain control
over the aircraft listed on Attachment 8, to the extent necessary to assure the
Contractor's ability to meet its guarantee under CRAF.  The Contractor shall, at
any time or times during the contract period, furnish to the Contracting Officer
upon demand, evidence that demonstrates the required control of said aircraft.
The Contractor shall not part with control of any aircraft accepted by AMC and
listed on Attachment 8 unless the loss is beyond the control of the Contractor,
such as aircraft accident, or the Contracting Officer, at his option, has agreed
to the substitution of other acceptable CRAF aircraft, as appropriate, and has
accomplished such substitution by contract modification.  Examples of failure to
maintain control within the intent of this paragraph are as follows; (1) failure
to retain US registry, (2) leasing of aircraft to unapproved foreign
contractors, (3) dry leasing of aircraft to US airlines or aircraft operators
not possessing a temporary or permanent certificate issued by the DOT and, (4)
removal of aircraft from active utilization (in storage, out of service, or
parked) and not flyable for reasons other than maintenance, repair, or overhaul.
Aircraft temporarily removed from active utilization that are mission capable
within 24 hours are considered to meet the control requirements of this
contract.  The parties agree that failure of the Contractor to maintain control
of any aircraft listed on Attachment 8, unless loss of the control is beyond the
control of the Contractor, such as aircraft accident, or approved by the
Contracting Officer, will constitute failure to have a currently existing
capability to perform services called for,  and will justify termination of this
contract under the clause entitled "Default."  In lieu of Default, the
Government, at its option, may, by unilateral contract modification, reduce its
purchase of airlift services for passengers or cargo, or both, during the
remaining period of the contract by an amount equal to the award share for the
remaining period of the contract attributable, under the formula used to
determine the original contract award entitlement, to the aircraft removed from
the AMC contract creditable mobilization base and deleted from Attachment 8.
Nothing in this paragraph shall limit the right of the Contracting Officer to
terminate this contract for cause for reasons other than failure to maintain
control of the above mentioned aircraft.

            (5)  Any non-certificated member of a Contractor Team Arrangement
must be an indirect air carrier, exercising effective ownership or control of
the aircraft.


3.  MAINTENANCE

        a.  The contractor shall furnish an aircraft for each flight capable of
completing the flight without requiring regularly scheduled maintenance.

        b.  No scheduled maintenance except en route or turnaround service and
safety of flight items shall be accomplished at military installations under
the terms of this contract except as otherwise authorized by the
Administrative Contracting Officer (ACO) when deemed to be in the best
interest of the Government. Request for performance of maintenance other than
en route or turn-around servicing, shall be submitted to the Contract
Administrator and the local Operations Center/Command Post. It shall be the
responsibility of the Contractor to arrange for all scheduled aircraft
maintenance and to provide for movement of aircraft to and from their selected
maintenance activity without charge to the Government. Such movement to and
from selected maintenance activity shall not become part of scheduled route
operations. If any maintenance service is to be performed including en route,
turnaround, safety of flight, or scheduled maintenance during ground time of
aircraft, Contractor shall notify the local Operations Center/Command Post as
follows:

            (1)  Specific type of maintenance to be performed;

C-2
<PAGE>
 
            (2)  Anticipated duration;

            (3)  Type of Government Furnished Service desired in conjunction
with performance of the turnaround or en route maintenance service;

            (4)  Any reimbursable support desired in conjunction with
performance of the turnaround or en route maintenance service; and

            (5)  Any change in status or type of work to be performed
subsequent to initial notification to Operations Center/Command Post will be
immediately communicated to the Operations Center/Command Post.

       c.  The Operations Center/Command Post will coordinate the above
information with Maintenance Control to assure proper spotting of the aircraft
in relation to the degree of hazard associated with the maintenance work to be
performed. Aerial Port Contract Coordinator (CONCOR) and any other interested
base agencies will also be notified by the Operations Center/Command Post.
Except as otherwise specified in the contract, no charge will be made for any
Government furnished services required to perform en route turnaround
maintenance checks and servicing. If any services or material are required to
perform other than turnaround maintenance checks and servicing, such services
or material will be provided on a reimbursable basis in accordance with Air
Force Regulation (AFR) 55-20 and Air Force Manual (AFM) 67-1, Vol I, Part I,
Chapter 10, SECTION O, Subsection 2. Requests for reimbursable services will
be passed from the Operations Center/Command Post to the CONCOR who will
arrange for performance of the required services. Contractor shall comply with
the Air Force "Foreign Objects Damage Program" in accordance with AFR 66-33.

4.  AMC TACC OPERATIONS CENTERS

     AMC TACC Operations Centers are primarily concerned with mission
monitoring/status and only under cases of extreme emergency will guidance be
provided by the Operations Center as it pertains to mission accomplishment.  All
other problems shall be directed to the ACO or appropriate Contract
Administrator for resolution.

5.  SPECIAL ASSIGNMENT AIRLIFT MISSIONS or EXERCISE MISSIONS

     When positioning at the initial on-load station for a Special Assignment
Airlift Mission (SAAM) or Exercise mission, the contractor shall provide the
AMC mission identifier, aircraft tail number, and ETA to the controlling
numbered TACC Operations Center (OC), i.e., McGuire AFB NJ, or Travis AFB CA.
This information shall be reported as soon as the aircraft departs the last
station prior to positioning at the on-load station originating the SAAM or
Exercise mission. If a mission will be delayed beyond the scheduled or
contractual positioning time, contractor shall report the cause for delay and
the estimated revised ETA to the controlling numbered TACC Operations Center.

6.  UNLAWFUL SEIZURE

     The Contractor, in performance of this contract, shall have established a
program to prevent unlawful seizure of aircraft.  At airports, bases, and air
terminals where there is a Air Mobility Command (AMC) presence or where US
forces are present and responsible for deployment/redeployment of forces, the
military will be responsible for security processing of passengers at on/off
load.   At en route/technical stops and at locations where there is no AMC or
military presence, security processing of passengers shall be the responsibility
of the contractor.  At these locations, the Contractor shall satisfy the
requirements of the FAA security program for scheduled/charter operations in
commercial service.  Contractor shall establish procedures for off-load of
baggage of gate "No Show" passengers unless that baggage has received customs
preclearance.  Copies of the Contractor's program shall be furnished to the
Administrative Contracting Officer (ACO) upon request.

C-3
<PAGE>
 
7.  UNUSUAL WEATHER CONDITIONS

       a.  Contract missions will be permitted into military stations under
either actual or forecast typhoon/hurricane condition I or II, provided such
flights are conducted in accordance with Federal Aviation Regulation's
applicable provisions of the USAF Foreign Clearance Guide, regulations of the
foreign country in which the station is located, and have the approval of the
departure and destination station AMC commander (base commander where there is
no AMC commander). This approval must be obtained prior to originating each
flight segment entering the above forecast conditions. There are no
restrictions relative to actual or forecast typhoon condition III or IV.

       b.  Whenever possible, every effort should be made to delay a civil
mission at the originating station in instances when severe weather (for
example, a typhoon) is forecast for the terminating station, rather than
permit the mission to proceed to an en route station and then be delayed.

8.  AIR ROUTE TRAFFIC CONTROL CLEARANCE OF AIRCRAFT

       a.  The Contractor shall use the appropriate FAA or ICAO clearance form
when clearing aircraft from civil airports. When clearing from military
installations, DD Form 175, Military Flight Plan, or appropriate FAA or ICAO
clearance form may be used. Civil aircraft commanders are vested with self-
clearance authority; therefore, military clearance officers are not required
to sign clearance.

       b.  The DD Form 2401, Civil Aircraft Landing Permit, issued to the AMC
contract carriers constitutes prior approval for landings at AF bases only
while performing bona fide US Government AMC contract missions. Commanders are
authorized to impose a penalty landing fee for any aircraft which lands at an
AF base without prior authority (a valid DD Form 2401) except for bona fide
emergency landings. Unauthorized landings constitute a violation and the base
commander will take action in accordance with AFR 55-20, Use of United States
Air Force Installations by Other Than United States Department of Defense
Aircraft.

9.  FLYING IN CONTROLLED AIRSPACE

     All contract flights shall fly over established airways, domestic or
international, and in controlled airspace.  Exception may be made to this
requirement where it is impractical to follow airways or fly in controlled
airspace, provided airways are intersected at the first practical point and
departed at the last practical radio navigational fix near destination, or when
area control or established airways do not exist within a flight information
region.  Economic considerations will not justify deviation from this procedure.

10.  BLUE BARK PASSENGER/CARGO

     Occasionally survivors of deceased military or civilian personnel of the
DOD are carried on contract missions. The code name assigned by AMC to these
passengers is BLUE BARK. The originating station CONCOR will tell the local
contractor representative of the names of the BLUE BARK passengers on board.
The contractor shall ensure that these passengers are afforded the utmost
courtesy throughout their trip. When such passengers are terminating at a
civil airport the contractor shall tell the CONCOR at the nearest AMC
terminal. The CONCOR will make sure that proper onward handling is provided.
Cargo accompanied by a BLUE BARK Passenger at the civil airport normally is
accepted from the Government at plane side and delivered to the Government at
plane side, unless directed by special contract provisions requiring pickup
and delivery at a particular location.

11.  SCHEDULED TRAFFIC STOPS/OPERATIONAL STOPS

       a.  A scheduled traffic stop is a military required stop and scheduled
arrival/departure time must be met by the contractor.

C-4
<PAGE>
 
       b.  An operational stop is one made by the contractor for their own
convenience. At such stops, the contractor has the right to depart the
aircraft upon completion of its own required ground operations. The Government
may on/off-load passengers or cargo at operational stops if this does not
interfere with the contractor's ground operations or delay their departure.
Even though operational stops are reflected in the published schedule, the
contractor may overfly such stops and AMC may not force the contractor to land
at such stations for the purpose of on/off-loading traffic. Special care must
be taken to make sure any off-load or on-load of passengers at operational
stops do not conflict with the diplomatic clearance or customs required of the
country involved.

12.  UNAUTHORIZED TRANSPORT OF PERSONNEL ON FERRY SEGMENTS

     Under provisions of the AMC airlift service contracts only those Government
personnel traveling for contract administration purposes are authorized
transportation on the ferry segments of AMC contract flights.

13.  ROUTE SUPPORT

       a.  Where support items or personnel are required for performance of
this contract, the contractor may transport route support items and personnel,
including support for aircraft not operationally ready, in belly compartments,
in any space available on a ferry segment of any trip, and in unused
guaranteed standard ACL space which may exist due to nongeneration of
Government traffic. However, in any such case, any passengers and/or cargo
displaced by said route support will result in appropriate reduction in
payment to the contractor for such flight. The contractor will not be charged
for use of Government 463L pallets nor for on/off-loading services in
connection with moving route support cargo. Route support personnel are
employed by the contractor for route support and required for performance of
this contract.

       b.  A request received by the contractor for transportation of route
support cargo for other AMC contractors will be referred to the ACO, who may,
at his/her discretion, permit such transportation.

       c.  Contractor requests for transportation of route support personnel or
equipment on military or another AMC contract aircraft will be referred to the
ACO.  The ACO will, in his/her sole discretion, decide whether or not to permit
such transportation.

       d.  The contractor route support items including the baggage of the
crews shall be stowed aboard the aircraft in a place that will not restrict or
impede the immediate off-load at destination points of cargo and/or the
personal baggage of passengers. The contractor's crew members shall not
transport motorized cycles or like equipment on passenger flights.

14.  REFERENCED PUBLICATIONS AND FORMS

     Publications and forms referenced in this contract are listed in Atch 10.

15.  CONTRACTOR TEAM ARRANGEMENT

     The term Contractor Team Arrangement as used in this contract includes
any and all permissible team arrangements identified in the Federal
Acquisition Regulation and supplements thereto. Any teaming arrangements
proposed for fulfillment of the requirements of this contract are subject to
approval by the Government. All teaming arrangements must be documented and
defined in a teaming arrangement agreement or similar document which defines
the roles, responsibilities, and relationships of the parties thereto. All
agreements must be signed by all parties thereto.

         -----
              (1)  Acceptable Service: The Scheduled Service which does not
                   ------------------
exceed the maximum elapsed time (MET) set forth in SECTION B. Missions that
require passengers to board or disembark between 2400 hours and 0600 hours
local will not be considered if other flights are available.

              (2)  Most Expeditious Service: The service offered by the
                   ------------------------
contractor requiring the shortest flying time between POE and POD.

              (3)  Maximum Elapsed Time: The combined time of the outbound and
                   --------------------
inbound segments of a round trip mission.

day period over a contracted scheduled service route. The new service will be
utilized for expansion requirements only.

     c.  If the Contractor is unable to accommodate a booked Scheduled Service
passenger on any delay that exceeds 8 hours, the Contractor will accommodate
such passenger on the first available flight of the contractor to the
passenger's destination.  In event the Contractor is unable to accommodate the
passenger, on its own flight within 24 hours from the original schedule, the
Contractor will obtain substitute service.  The purchase of such service must
comply with the Fly America Act and be approved by the Contracting Officer.  In
such event, the Contractor would be paid the original contract price.

F-5
<PAGE>
 
              (1)  Controllable Delays: The Contractor will provide, without
                   ------------------- 
charge to the passenger or to the Government, meals, quarters, and

be provided. The Contractor shall submit an invoice supported by receipts for
billets and transportation charges to HQ AMC/XOKMA for reimbursement of these
charges. The Government shall effect fair and reasonable payment to the
Contractor on receipt of a valid invoice.

     d.  Twelve hours in advance of flight departure time, AMC will furnish the
Contractor at the originating station with a passenger list, AMC Form 117, AMC
Passenger List, or other appropriate document listing the passengers booked for
that flight.  The passenger will present the Contractor's ticket agent a DD Form
1482, AMC Transportation Authorization (MTA).  The Contractor will annotate the
passenger list indicating whether the passenger appeared or no-showed.  If a
passenger does not have a DD Form 1482, and the passenger is booked, Contractor
shall attach a copy of the passenger's orders to the passenger list.  If a
passenger has only one copy of his/her orders, the Contractor shall reproduce a
copy of the orders.  The Contractor shall sign the AMC Passenger List and return
the list with an MTA for each passenger moved to the appropriate AMC reporting
station within 24 hours of flight departure for locations where the originating
station and AMC reporting station are collocated and 48 hours for other than
collocated stations.

     e.  The Government will pay for all scheduled seats in accordance with the
procedures in SECTION G, whether or not a passenger is booked against those
seats.  Since the Government has purchased these reserved seats, the Government
reserves the right to add or substitute passenger names within the reserved seat
capacity (as indicated on the AMC Form 117 or other appropriate document listing
passengers) up to 1 hour and 30 minutes prior to flight departure.  Contractor
will not cancel these "CATYMIL" bookings until this time without approval of a
PRC representative.  The Government (AMC reporting station or PRC) will be
allowed to substitute nonscheduled passengers for no-shows in the Scheduled
Service System.

     f.  Personnel shall not be accommodated in the Scheduled Service System
above the PRC Total Scheduled Seat (manifested seats) without prior approval
of the AMC Reporting Station or PRC. The Contractor shall be reimbursed only
for the PRC total scheduled seats plus any additional approved seats.

     g.  Contractor shall provide secure space and facilities for two AMC
representatives at the applicable commercial terminals in the vicinity of the
passenger processing counter.

7.  GOVERNMENT CONTROLLABLE DELAYS - CAT B CARGO (DEMURRAGE)

Compensation will accrue to the contractor for departure delays of more than 3
hours beyond the scheduled block time on completed cargo missions when delay is
Government controllable.  Demmurage charges are limited to delays in loading or
unloading but exclude delays due to damage resulting from the negligence of
government personnel.  The compensation will be as set forth in SECTION B.
Delays due to Act of God, ATC or contractor controllable reasons will not be
compensated.

EXAMPLE:

   B747 cargo aircraft is scheduled to depart at 0700. Departure is delayed
   due to a broken K-loader until 1140 (4 hours 40 minutes Government
   controlled delay). Contractor is entitled to demurrage payment of $2492. (1
   hour 40 minutes rounded to the next whole hour compensable).

PART I - THE SCHEDULE

SECTION G - CONTRACT ADMINISTRATION DATA

1.  EXPANSION ALLOCATION

        a.  Entitlement will be calculated in the same manner as calculated for
the fixed, peacetime airlift award and described in paragraph b, below.
Teaming Arrangements (TAs) are to be aware that when two entities of a TA make
an acceptable offer under expansion business, the TA agent will be asked to make
the decision which contractor will perform the mission.  Factors used to
determine the acceptability of an offer include aircraft type, aircraft weight
capacity, date of availability and total cost.  The Contracting Officer will
determine which offers are acceptable.

        b.  Ordering of expansion business will be allocated monthly based on
entitlement calculated by dividing each carrier's mobilization points by the
total points of all carriers offering in a category.  The L-100 does not receive
entitlement from the CRAF, and therefore, will not be counted toward any
individual contractor's entitlement.  Six months after contract start date,
mobilization value points will be recalculated to include any additional
aircraft added to the CRAF.  Recalculated entitlement percentages will be
utilized on expansion business only.  Scheduled service expansion will be
ordered based on meeting the METs.  Entitlement will be used to allocate
business among carriers when more than one carrier meets the METs.  Entitlement
not used in one month may not be carried over to a future month.  These
percentages are calculated for every category.  If a contractor does not operate
in a particular category, the entitlement is distributed among those contractors
who offer.  Such service shall be ordered in accordance with the procedures set
forth in this SECTION.  The Government is not undertaking any obligation to
issue orders for services and will issue such orders only when it is considered
in the best interest of the Government.  The Government may from time to time
purchase services to be performed by aircraft other than those specified herein.
Aircraft must meet all other terms and conditions outlined elsewhere in this
contract.

2.  DELIVERY ORDERS

        a.  The Government will request and contractors shall submit offers for
expansion airlift (except as specified in paragraph 3 below) via the electronic,
coded bulletin board or telefax.  An offer submitted via the bulletin board or
telefax is considered a firm offer that, when accepted by the government,
becomes binding.  Issuance of a delivery order (DD Form 1155) serves as
government acceptance of the contractor's offer.  Delivery orders shall set
forth (1) the services being ordered, (2) performance date, (3) price, (4) fund
cite, and (5) any other pertinent information.  In emergencies, offers may be
requested, submitted, and accepted by telephone or telefax.  Contractors shall
confirm telephone offers in writing (by bulletin board or telefax) within 24
hours.  The government will issue a delivery order confirming emergency orders.
An executed copy of each delivery order will be mailed to the contractor.

G-1
<PAGE>
 
        b.  Category (CAT)-A Cargo:  The Contractor and the Government may agree
to move cargo over any of the Contractor's scheduled routes at the rates set
forth in the AMC Uniform Negotiated Rates and Rules or the Contractor's
published tariff, whichever is lower.  When the Contractor agrees to move such
traffic, a delivery order will be issued which will purchase a specified number
of pallets/pounds of cargo by route.  The delivery order will show the route,
period of performance, quantitative requirements, and the rate and total dollar
amount for cargo movement.  (Ref Atch 6).

3.  SCHEDULED SERVICE ORDERS

The Government will request and contractors shall make offers for scheduled
service expansion airlift by telephone or otherwise.  Offers will be solicited
on the basis of seats per month.  Offers will be evaluated on the basis of MET,
availability, and entitlement.  Each requirement to be ordered as expansion will
be assigned an individual call number and entered on a Scheduled Service Order
(SSO) which identifies (1) the route, (2) performance date, (3) price, (4) fund
cite, (5) name of individual making the offer for the contractor and (6) any
other pertinent information.  On the first business day of each week, during the
contract period of performance, the contracting officer will forward (telefax)
the contractor the SSO for the previous weeks activity.  The SSOs will be
sequentially numbered (6900-OCT-01,02 etc.).  Ordering occurs through the
bilateral execution of the SSO.  The contractor is required to sign the SSO and
return it to the contracting officer.  The SSO shall become a binding contract.
An executed copy will be mailed to the contractor.

4.  RECEIPT FOR SERVICES PERFORMED

        a.  An AMC Form 8 will be issued for each Category (CAT)-B mission to be
performed under this contract.  These documents will be used for payment
purposes as well as certifying the transportation services rendered by the
Contractor pursuant to the terms of this contract.  The AMC Form 8 will be
prepared and appropriate remarks entered at each station by the Government.  The
Government will provide the Contractor representative the AMC Form 8 who in-turn
will be responsible for insuring that it is aboard the aircraft from origin to
final destination of the mission.  At final destination station, the
Contractor's representative shall sign the AMC Form 8 certifying that the
services were performed in accordance with the contract.  The Government
representative at final destination will retain one copy of the AMC Form 8 to be
mailed to HQ AMC/XOKMA, 402 Scott Dr Room 132,  Scott AFB IL 62225-5363.  The
original and one copy will be returned to the Contractor's representative.  The
contractor will be responsible to provide a completed copy of the AMC Form 8
with submission of the payment voucher.  Scheduled service will be accepted on a
DD Form 250, Material Inspection and Receiving Report, prepared by the
Government.

        b.  CAT-A Cargo.  A DD Form 250 will be issued by the Quality Assurance
Evaluator (QAE), indicating the amount of CAT-A cargo moved by flight
number/date.  The frequency of issue of the DD Form 250 will be as mutually
agreed between the Government and the Contractor.  Sufficient copies of the DD
Form 250 with waybills will accompany the shipment to the receiving activity.
Upon receipt of the CAT-A cargo at the destination, an authorized Government
representative will sign/date in Item 22 of the DD Form 250 to verify acceptance
of the shipment.  The Contractor will attach two copies of the DD Form 250 and
applicable waybills to his billing and submit them to HQ AMC/XOKM, 402 Scott Dr
Room 132, Scott AFB IL  62225-5363 for payment.  Authorization for payment of

10.  SCHEDULE RELIABILITY - CAT-B MISSIONS ONLY

       a. The Contractor's schedule reliability rate shall be computed for a
three-month period by subtracting the total number of Contractor-controllable
delays during the 3-month period from the Contractor's total number of
scheduled originating and turnaround station departures in that 3-month
period, and dividing the remainder by the Contractor's total number of
scheduled originating and turnaround station departures for the period. In the
event a Contractor had a CRAF contract the previous year, the schedule
reliability for the final 2 months of the previous year will be used in
determining schedule reliability for the first 2 months of this contract. This
reliability rate computation shall be made as of 2400 hours GMT on the last
day of each calendar month. The originating station is defined as the initial
on-load station of a mission. The turnaround station is defined as that
station of a round-trip mission where the mission number changes, or initial
backhaul on-load station of a round-trip SPECIAL ASSIGNMENT AIRLIFT MISSION
(SAAM).

       b. The schedule reliability rate, which is based on the combination of
total departures in both 21 AF and 22 AF, may be measured and enforced in
three ways, and each carrier performing hereunder is obligated to meet the
standard in each of those ways. First, the requirement applies to all service
performed under this contract by any one carrier. Second, in the event of a
Contractor Team Arrangement , the reliability requirement applies also to the
aggregate performance under the contract by all members of the Contractor Team
Arrangement. (Each member of the Contractor Team Arrangement bears joint and
several liability for failure of either the Contractor Team Arrangement in the
aggregate, or its individual carrier members performing hereunder, to meet the
schedule reliability requirement.) Third, for each carrier performing under
this contract, whether individually or as part of a Contractor Team
Arrangement, the requirement applies in the aggregate to all service performed
by that carrier under its CRAF contract with AMC.

       c. A delay shall be deemed to have occurred at the originating or
turnaround station if the Contractor's aircraft departs the blocks more than
20 minutes after the scheduled departure time. The scheduled departure time
shall be as established pursuant to SECTION F, paragraphs entitled "Schedules"
and "CAT-B Mission Positioning", and published in the Operations Bulletin as
amended by scheduling messages; the scheduled departure time at turnaround
stations shall be subject to revision as herein- after provided. A delay at
originating and turnaround stations, caused by factors beyond the control and
without the fault or negligence of the Contractor, shall be considered as
Contractor-uncontrollable; a delay for any other reason shall be considered
Contractor-controllable. The Contractor-uncontrollable delay time experienced
at the originating and en route stations on a mission shall be added to the
scheduled departure time at the turnaround station for purposes of determining
the scheduled departure time at the turnaround station on that mission.
Additionally, if missions are scheduled back-to-back with an aircraft that
experienced a Contractor-uncontrollable delay, this uncontrollable delay time
shall be added to the scheduled departure time of the subsequent AMC mission
with the resultant delay charged as Contractor-uncontrollable. This will give
the Contractor sufficient recovery time to return to schedule or obtain
substitute service for his follow-on 


G-5


missions.  However, the Contractor-controllable delay time experienced on a 
previous mission shall not be added to the scheduled departure time at the 
originating station for any subsequent mission.  In the latter instance, the
Contractor is required to originate his next mission, on schedule, with his own
aircraft or substitute service.

d.  The Contractor and in the case of a Contractor Team Arrangement, each
carrier, shall maintain an 80 percent schedule reliability rate as the minimum
acceptable standard of performance, based on 30 or more departures from
originating or turnaround stations during a 3-month period.  Where volume is
less than 30 departures, reliability will be reviewed on a case-by-case basis.
Failure to maintain an 80 percent schedule reliability rate for a 3-month period
will be reason for termination, pursuant to the Contract Clause entitled
"Default."  However, nothing in this paragraph shall limit the right of the
Government to terminate this contract for cause for other reasons or to limit
any other rights and remedies provided the Government by law or under this
contract.


e.  It is understood that, should a schedule reliability rate fall below an
average of 85 percent for a 3-month period, the Government may elect not to
order expansion transportation services pursuant to this SECTION of this
contract.

11.  5352.247-1002 CONTRACTOR'S FAILURE TO PROVIDE SERVICE (MAR 1988)-AMCFARS
(CAT-B Missions Only)

a.  In the event that Contractor's aircraft is unable to depart from any station
or if it can depart from any station but is unable to transport the full amount
of generated traffic within the guaranteed ACL, the Government may invoke
remedies which are set forth in this paragraph, which will neither constitute a
termination within the meaning of the clause entitled "Termination for
Convenience of the Government," nor in any way, diminish the Government's rights
under the Clause entitled "Default."  The rights and remedies of the Government
provided for in this paragraph are not exclusive and do not give rise to
Government liability for costs incurred and are in addition to any other
Government rights and remedies provided for by law or by this contract.

b.  Deficit Traffic.  This term applies to a situation where the Contractor's
aircraft did depart, but where the full amount of traffic within the guaranteed
ACL was not transported on the flight involved due to reasons caused by the
Contractor.  The deficit shall be charged from the station where it is incurred
through to destination unless the Government utilizes the space at an en route
station.  Contractor shall not be paid for deficit traffic.  Contractor shall be
paid at the AMC negotiated uniform price for that portion of the trip, if any,
over which he did transport said traffic less a discount.  The discount shall be
equal to a percent of the amount otherwise due.  This percent shall be obtained
by dividing the deficit by the guaranteed ACL, but in no event shall that
percent or the discount be greater than 10 percent.  Deficit traffic moved by a
Contractor on any subsequent flight will be considered as newly generated
traffic.  The Contractor will not bill for the dollar value of the deficit
traffic, and the Government's guarantee with respect to that mission is reduced
accordingly.

c.  Substitute Service.  This term, as used herein, applies to the substitution
of an aircraft to replace Contractor's aircraft which is unable to proceed from
the departure station or from any en route station short of destination in
accordance with schedules established pursuant to this contract.  If the
Contractor fails to make an aircraft available for departure within 16 hours
subsequent to scheduled departure time for a passenger flight or a mixed flight
from an originating station or an en route station, or within 4 hours of a
scheduled departure time for a passenger flight or a mixed flight from an en
route station where no holding facilities for passengers are available, or
within 24 hours of a schedule departure time for a cargo flight from either the
originating station or an en route station, or for any flight within such lesser
time as may be agreed to by the Contractor's designee, the Government may:  (1)
cancel the requirement for further movement of the defaulted flight; (2) require
the Contractor to transport the defaulted passengers or cargo by substitute
service within such additional time as the Contracting Officer may allow; (3)
acquire substitute service from commercial sources; (4) reschedule the defaulted
flight; or transport the defaulted passengers or cargo, or any portion thereof,
itself.  The exercise of any of these options will be in accordance with the
following:

(1)  In the event that the requirement for further movement of the defaulted
flight is canceled, the number of passengers equal to the guaranteed ACL for the
flight involved, or the number of pounds of cargo equal to the guaranteed ACL of
the flight involved, or the number of miles for the flight involved, will be
subtracted from the Government's guarantee.  Any canceled requirement will be
deleted from the contract by unilateral modification.

If the failure to depart was from the originating station, Contractor will not
be paid any amount for the flight involved.  If the failure to depart was from
an en route station, the Contractor will be paid at the AMC negotiated uniform
rate for that portion of the trip over which he did transport the passengers or
cargo.

(2)  If the Contractor is required to transport the passengers or cargo of the
defaulted flight by substitute service within such additional time as the
Contracting Officer may allow, the Contractor shall arrange and pay directly all
costs involved in the transportation by the substitute aircraft.  Contractor
will be paid, in this event, the full contract price for the flight involved,
irrespective of the amount paid by him for this transportation by substitute
aircraft.  The substitute aircraft provided by the Contractor must be of like
type, configured in accordance with the applicable specifications, and must be
approved by the Contracting Officer.  In lieu of, or in addition to, providing
the above type substitute service, the Contractor may, at his own expense,
purchase the amount of space, by common carriage or otherwise, needed for the
movement of the passengers or cargo of the defaulted flight.  The purchase of
such space must be approved by the Contracting Officer and must be obtained only
from American Flag carriers, except that in the event an American Flag carrier
is unavailable or not reasonably available for point-to-point substitute service
within an overseas area, upon prior authorization of the Contracting Officer,
the Contractor may use a Foreign Flag schedule carrier for substitute service on
an exceptional basis only and provided the requirements of the clause entitled
"Preference for United States Flag Air Carriers," are complied with.  In such
event, Contractor would be paid the contract price for the involved
transportation.  If Contractor transports by purchase of common carriage only a
part of the number of passengers or amount of cargo of the defaulted flight, he
will only be paid for those passengers or cargo so transported, and the
passengers or cargo not transported shall be deducted from the Government's
guarantee.

(3)  The Government may purchase substitute service from commercial sources.
This can be by a substitute commercial aircraft or by the purchase from
commercial sources of sufficient space to transport by common carriage or
otherwise, the number of passengers or amount of cargo involved in the defaulted
flight.  In either event, the substitute service shall be deducted from the
Government's guarantee and the Contractor would be charged by the Government,
any amount which the Government had to pay to commercial sources which is in
excess of the contract price for the transportation of the passengers or cargo
involved for the distance involved.  If this substitute service is obtained for
only a portion of a trip as provided in the contract, the contract price will be
prorated for the distance involved in determining the amount due the Government.
Contractor will not be paid any amount for this defaulted flight except that he
will be paid at the AMC negotiated uniform rate for that portion of the trip, if
any, over which he did transport the passengers or cargo on the flight involved.
The Contractor shall provide all services normally provided in connection with
flights operating under this contract.  In the event the defaulted flight was to
be performed between military bases and the Government procures common carriage
substitute service, the defaulting Contractor shall be responsible for the
transportation between the military bases and the commercial terminal.

(4)  The Government may, in its discretion, elect to either reschedule the
defaulted flight to a later time within the performance period of the contract
or may move these passengers and/or this cargo, or any portion thereof.  In this
event, the number of passengers equal to the guaranteed ACL for the flight
involved, or the number of pounds of cargo to the guaranteed ACL of the flight
involved, or the number of miles for the flight involved will be subtracted from
the Government's guarantee and the Contractor will be charged, by the
Government, the excess, if any, of the charge for this movement as computed
under the provisions of AFR 76-28 over the contract price.  If this movement is
utilized for only a portion of a trip as provided in the contract, the contract
price will be prorated 
<PAGE>
 
for the distance involved in determining the amount due the Government.
Contractor will not be paid any amount for transportation of the passengers or
cargo of the defaulted flight except that he will be paid at the AMC
negotiated uniform rate for that portion of the trip, if any, over which he
did transport said passengers or cargo in the flight involved.

      d.  The Contracting Officer may permit the Contractor to provide
services with substitute aircraft having a lower ACL. When such substitution
of aircraft is permitted, the Contractor shall be reimbursed at the rate per
ton/passenger mile established in the original award times the lesser ACL with
a corresponding reduction in the Government's guarantee. In addition or as an
alternative to providing substitute aircraft having a lower ACL, the
Contracting Officer may permit the Contractor to acquire, at his own expense,
the amount of space, by common carriage, needed for movement of the passenger
or cargo equal to the ACL of the aircraft originally scheduled for the flight,
in which event the Contractor will be paid at the contract rate for the
passenger and/or cargo within the guaranteed ACL which are actually
transported. The Contracting Officer may also permit the Contractor to provide
services with substitute aircraft having a higher ACL than the aircraft
required for performance of services under the contract. In this event, the
Contractor will be reimbursed only the contract price for the flight as
originally awarded.

      e.  The Contracting Officer, in making his decisions and selections for
substitute service, will use his discretion in such a manner as to mitigate
Contractor's liability for excess costs when reasonably possible.  However,
military needs and urgency will be the prime consideration in the exercise of
this discretion.

      f. Irrespective of any of the provisions of this paragraph, the
Government may cancel any mission for movement of submarine crews if the
specified aircraft or an equal substitute aircraft acceptable to the
Government is not positioned two hours prior to scheduled departure time. This
cancellation, under these circumstances, is at the sole discretion of the
Government and will be at no cost to the Government. This will not be
considered against the Government's other rights to "no cost cancellations."

      g.  The provisions of Attachment 1, "Performance Work Statement Passenger
Service," relative to Contractor's responsibility for care of passengers, and
for providing meals and billets, apply to all situations discussed in this
paragraph, wherein the Contractor failed to depart as scheduled.  Contractor
shall retain responsibility for passengers until such time as they are moved by
the Contractor or the Government, or the requirement is canceled by the
Government.

      h.  In the event the Contractor fails to deliver any part of the GACL 
(passenger or cargo) to manifested destination due to an accident, Contractor 
will be paid at AMC negotiated uniform rate only for that amount of passenger 
or cargo delivered to manifested destination.

12.  CONTRACTOR POINT OF CONTACT

The Contractor shall furnish to the ACO at HQ AMC:

      a.  The name of a person and point of contact who will serve as a liaison
between the Contractor and the ACO and,

      b.  The name of a person and point of contact who will serve as liaison 
between the Contractor and the Contract Administrator (CA) for each station 
transited.  This person must have authority to adjust schedules, engage 
substitute service, and make decisions pertinent to the airlift service, in 
the name of the Contractor.

13.  DISCREPANCY PERFORMANCE RATE

      a.  A discrepancy performance rate shall be computed on a monthly basis to
determine the level of contract violations.  This rate is computed by dividing
the total number of mission segment inspections performed during the period into
the total number of discrepancies for that period.  Mission segment inspections
shall be performed at all 

G-8
<PAGE>
 
stations in the routing, including origination, turnaround and en route, where 
the aircraft can be inspected by a QAE or CA.  The discrepancy performance 
rate shall be computed as soon as possible after the monthly discrepancy 
reports are received by HQ AMC/XOKM.

      b. A discrepancy shall be established whenever the Contractor's aircraft
or service is in violation of the terms and conditions of this contract and
shall be documented on a Contract Violation Notice, AMC Form 166b. During an
inspection, each type of discrepancy will be listed only once on an AMC Form
166b (e.g., 10 seats torn-one discrepancy, 100 meals without date stamps-one
discrepancy, etc.). An AMC Form 166b will not be issued for a contractor
controllable delay since these violations are included in the schedule
reliability rate.

      c.  The minimum acceptable standard of performance under this contract 
shall be a discrepancy performance rate not to exceed 10 percent, as an
average, for a consecutive 3-month period with a total of 30 or more
departures from originating and turnaround stations. Where volume is less than
30 departures, discrepancies will be reviewed on a case-by-case basis. Failure
to maintain an average discrepancy rate of 10 percent or less may be reason
for termination, pursuant to the clause entitled "Default". However, nothing
in this paragraph shall limit the right of the Government to terminate this
contract (for cause for other reasons) or to limit any other rights and
remedies provided the Government by law or under this contract. The Government
may elect not to order expansion transportation service pursuant to this
SECTION of this contract.

14.  EXTENDED PARKING

      a. Requests for extended parking privileges exceeding 8 hours will be
reviewed on an individual basis and may be honored consistent with the
availability of space, equipment, and manpower resources. Extended ground time
exceeding 8 hours will be requested and concurrence or nonconcurrence received
through the local operations center, in coordination with deputy commander for
maintenance/chief of maintenance, and aerial port manager. Evaluation of the
contractor's request for extended parking privileges will be considered based
on the following :

          (1)  Positioning of aircraft in advance of time stipulated in the 
contract so as to prevent delays due to weather, crew limitations, or other 
reasons.  

          (2)  Back-to-back scheduling of aircraft for a follow-on AMC mission.

          (3)  Other programmed mission requirements.

          (4)  Aircraft programmed or scheduled for subsequent commercial 
operation on termination of a military mission at a military station will not 
be granted extended parking privileges.

      b.  Use of the following procedures in requesting approval for extended 
parking:

          (1)  Contractor may submit a request any time prior to arrival of 
the aircraft.  If the request is prior to mission execution, the approval 
should come through the NAF/DOO scheduler.  While the mission is in execution, 
approval should be via the NAF/DOC.

          (2)  The local operations center will coordinate the request with 
the deputy commander for maintenance/chief of maintenance, and squadron/port 
operations office, and will advise the contractor whether the request has been 
approved, or disapproved prior to the arrival of aircraft.

          (3)  The TACC Current Operations (DOOM) scheduler will intervene at 
the contractor's request if these procedures result in denial.

      c.  If approval is granted for extended parking privileges, it will be 
subject to the following criteria:

G-9
<PAGE>
 
          (1)  Taxiing crews required when towing services are not available 
for the immediate respotting of an aircraft from a terminating mission shall be
contractor-furnished.  Towing equipment/crews required in the repositioning of
an aircraft resulting from the above action, or from a maintenance area, shall
be contractor-furnished, with the exception of the tractor and driver which will
be furnished by the Government.

          (2)  The Government will not be responsible for late positioning of 
contractor aircraft due to the lack of towing tractors, other equipment, or
personnel. Equipment or personnel may be withdrawn from contractor use for
higher priority AMC mission support, in accordance with the AMC Mission
Priority System. The command post will determine priorities for allocation of
manpower and equipment to service AMC military or contract aircraft.

          a.  General.  Prior to performance of any services hereunder, the
Carrier shall, at its own expense, procure and maintain during the entire
performance period of this contract, with financially and legally responsible
insurance company or companies, passenger and public liability insurance in
accordance with paragraph b or c, below.  Liability insurance purchased pursuant
to the requirements of this paragraph shall cover payment to the Government,
pursuant to the subrogation provision of the Medical Care Recovery Act (42 USC
265l-3) and within the liability limitations of this contract, of the cost of
Government provided medical care to the extent that said insurance would cover
payment to injured individuals of the cost of medical care in the absence of any
Government obligation to provide medical care.  The Carrier shall furnish to the
Contracting Officer a Certificate of Insurance, duly executed by the Insurer, of
the insurance required by this paragraph.  The Certificate of Insurance shall
substantially conform to the form set forth in paragraph d, below.  If a court
of competent jurisdiction determines that any transportation furnished pursuant
to this contract is subject to the Warsaw Convention, 49 Stat. 3000, and that
the Carrier is entitled to limit its liability under that Convention, then the
minimum limit of insurance required by this clause shall be considered to be a
"higher limit of liability agreed to by special contract" as contemplated by the
last sentence of Article 22(l) of that Convention, and the Contractor agrees
that it shall not with respect to any claim arising out of the death, wounding,
or other bodily injury of a passenger, avail itself of any defense under Article
20(l) of the Convention.  Nothing herein shall be deemed to affect the rights
and liabilities of the Carrier with regard to any claim brought by, on behalf
of, or in respect of any person who has willfully caused damage which resulted
in death, wounding, or other bodily injury of a passenger.  See note below
subparagraph c(2) of paragraph entitled, "Passenger and Public Liability
Insurance".

          b.  Split Limits Liability.  The minimum limits of liability insurance
coverage  maintained by the Carrier shall be as follows:

                (1) Liability for bodily injury to or death of aircraft
passengers: A limit for any one passenger of at least three hundred thousand

                (2) Liability for bodily injury to or death of persons
(excluding passengers): A limit of at least three hundred thousand dollars
($300,000.00) for any one person in any one occurrence, and a limit of at
least twenty million dollars ($20,000,000.00) for each occurrence.

                (3) Liability for loss of or damage to property: A limit of at
least twenty million dollars ($20,000,000.00) for each occurrence.

          c.  Combined Single Limit Liability.

                (1) Notwithstanding the provisions of paragraph b above the
Carrier may be insured for a single limit of liability for each occurrence. In
that event, coverage must be equal to or greater than the combined required
minimums set forth in paragraph b, above, for bodily injury, property damage,
and/or passenger liability for the type of use to which such aircraft is put,
as the case may be.

                (2) In the case of a single limit of liability, aircraft may
be insured by a combination of primary and excess policies. Such policies must
have combined coverage equal to or greater than the required minimums set
forth in paragraph b, above, for bodily injury to non-passengers, property
damage, and/or passenger liability for the type of use to which the aircraft
is put, as the case may be.

obligation and responsibility to furnish appropriate agencies all required
manifest, immigration, and border clearance documents, covering all personnel
and cargo aboard the aircraft upon entry into the United States or a foreign

military installation is required by Contractor personnel for ground handling of
aircraft, the  Contractor personnel must meet the requirements established by
AFR 205-1, Chapter 11, and DD Form 254 (Attachment 10).  Applications for
personnel security investigations shall be made to the local chief of security
police.  (Military installations are airfields that are owned, leased, or
controlled by the US Government.)

          b.  While on military installations or on military portions of civil
installations, Contractor personnel shall comply with security regulations
promulgated by the military installation/activity commander.  Security
regulations are directive in nature and will be adhered to by all contractor
personnel.  Senior Lodger station managers, both CONUS and overseas, are
responsible for ensuring that all contractor personnel are aware of station
regulations.

7.  RESPONSIBILITY FOR GOVERNMENT CARGO

          a.  Property (hereinafter referenced in this paragraph as Government
cargo) placed in Contractor's possession for the sole purpose of air
transportation shall not be deemed to be Government Property within the meaning
of the Government Property Clause.  Government cargo, within the meaning of this
paragraph, does not include passenger baggage.

          b.  The Government hereby relieves the Contractor of liability for
loss of, or damage to, any and all Government cargo transported by the
Contractor in performance of this contract, except such loss, destruction and
damage resulting from the willful misconduct or lack of good faith of any of the
Contractor's managerial personnel, as defined in the contract clauses entitled
"Government Property," (Fixed-Price Contract) - Alternate I, and except as
follows:

                (1) If, other than at the direction of the Government, it
should be necessary to off-load cargo at any en route commercial stations, the
Contractor shall immediately notify the ACO. The ACO will be apprised of the
Contractor's arrangements for movement of the cargo to its originally
consigned destination. The Contractor shall at his expense be responsible for
safeguarding such cargo from loss, theft, or damage by the elements or other
causes until such time as the Contractor is relieved of responsibility by the
ACO. The provisions of SECTION G apply in determining whether the Contractor
should be charged a deficit.

                (2) In the event of an accident, the Contractor will be
responsible for providing continuous protection of all cargo aboard the
aircraft and for delivery of the cargo to the point designated by the ACO.

                (3)  To the extent insurance required by subparagraph b(3) of
paragraph entitled, "Passenger and Public Liability Insurance" of this SECTION
or the appropriate portion of subparagraph c of paragraph entitled, "Passenger
and Public Liability Insurance" of this SECTION (if Combined Single Limit
Liability is used), is not required for payment of third party claims, the
balance of said insurance shall apply to Government property loss, damage or
destruction thereto.

          c.  Any expenses incurred by the Contractor in connection with
safeguarding cargo off-loaded at the direction of the Government at any
commercial field will be reimbursable to the Contractor by the Government by a
Supplemental Agreement to this contract.

8.  COLLECTIVE BARGAINING UNITS

          a.  The contractor agrees to advise the applicable Collective
Bargaining Units of the contract requirements set forth in SECTION C 
paragraph 2.

          b.  The Contractor agrees to provide the Contracting Officer, upon
request, a copy of any Collective Bargaining Agreement applicable to employees
performing on this contract.

9.  PETROLEUM SUPPORT

          a.  Upon completion of round trip missions, Contractors are entitled
to purchase sufficient POL at Defense Fuel Supply Center (DFSC) standard prices
for movement of the aircraft to its nearest home base.  For example:
McGuire/Dover/Charleston to Kennedy/Philadelphia/Wilmington or Travis/Norton to
San Francisco/Los Angeles/Seattle- Tacoma.  If the Contractor is depositioning
their aircraft to a point other than its nearest home base, the amount of fuel
at DFSC standard prices will not be more than that quantity which would be
needed to deposition to the Contractor's nearest home base.  For the purpose of
purchasing POL in excess of the amount required to deposition to contractor's
home base, an AMC mission will be considered a civil aircraft not under contract
or charter within the provisions of AFR 144-9.  The sale of POL in excess of
depositioning POL will be at the DFSC standard price plus a 5.5 percent
accessorial and administrative charge, except as provided for in paragraph c,
below.

          b.  Upon completion of one-way trips Contractors are entitled to
purchase sufficient POL at DFSC standard prices for movement of the aircraft to
point of origin of the trip or to the home base nearest to the point of origin,
if within the general area of the point of origin of the live trip.  If the
Contractor has commercial business for the ferry trip, the Contractor is
entitled to purchase POL at the DFSC standard price from the destination point
of the one-way mission to the point of origin of the commercial mission as long
as this station is less distant than the original ferry leg.

          c.  Upon completion of one-way or round trip missions, Contractors
will be allowed to purchase POL at DFSC standard price for ferrying from one
coast to another when positioning to originate another AMC mission.  Fuel at
DFSC standard price also will be provided to permit the return of an aircraft to
the opposite coast (or any point short of the opposite coast) if, in fact, the
mission originated on the opposite coast regardless of the location of the
contractor's home base.  Contractors may not transit other Air Force bases en
route while ferrying cross country.

10.  LEGAL DOCUMENTS

The Contractor shall submit, simultaneously with its transfer to the DOT, one
copy to HQ AMC/XOK and one copy to HQ AMC/JAN of each application, pleading, or
other document submitted to said Agency by the Contractor or by any organization
of which the Contractor is a member, which application, pleading, or other
document pertains, directly or indirectly, to this or any other contract for air
transportation to which AMC is a party or is expected to be a party.  Included
among such pleadings are any pertaining to the leasing of any aircraft listed in
Attachment 8.

11.  REQUIRED REPORTS

          a.  FINANCIAL AND MILEAGE REPORT.  The Contractor shall file with HQ

12.  INVITED CONTRACTOR OR TECHNICAL REPRESENTATIVE STATUS - REPUBLIC OF KOREA

          a.  Invited-contractor or technical representative status under the
US-ROK SOFA is subject to the written approval of HQ USFK, ATTN:  ACJ, APO
96301-0010.

          b.  The Contracting Officer will coordinate with HQ USFK, ATTN:  ACJ
in accordance with DFARS, subpart 225.802, and USFK Reg 700-19.  The AC of S,
Acquisition Management, HQ USFK, will determine the appropriate contractor
status under the SOFA and notify the ACO of the determination.

          c.  Subject to the above approval, the Contractor, including their
employees and lawful dependents, may be accorded such privileges and exemptions
as specified in the US-ROK SOFA, and implemented per USFK Reg 700-19, subject to
the conditions and limitations imposed by the SOFA and that regulation.  These
privileges and exemptions may be furnished during the performance period of the
contract, subject to their availability and provided the invited-contractor or
technical-representative status is not withdrawn by USFK.

          d.  The Contractor officials and employees performing under this
contract collectively and separately warrant that they are not now performing,
nor will perform during the period of this contract, any contract services or
otherwise engage in business activities in the ROK other than those pertaining
to the US armed forces.

          e.  During the performance of the work in the ROK required by this
contract, the contractor will be governed by USFK regulations pertaining to the
direct hiring and the personnel administration of Korean National employees.

          f.  The authorities of the ROK will have the right to exercise
jurisdiction over invited contractors and technical representatives, including
officials and employees, and their dependents, for offenses committed in the ROK
and punishable by the laws of the ROK.  In recognition of the role of such
persons in the defense of the ROK, they will be subject to the provisions of
paragraphs 5, 7(b), and 9 of the US-ROK SOFA and the related agreed minutes of
US-ROK SOFA, Article XXII.  In those cases in which the authorities of the ROK
decide not to exercise jurisdiction, they shall notify the US military
authorities as soon as possible.  On such notification, the military authorities
will have the right to exercise such jurisdiction over the persons referred to,
as conferred on them by the law of the United States.

H-14
<PAGE>
 
          g.  Invited contractors and technical representatives agree to
cooperate fully with the USFK sponsoring agency and responsible officer on all
matters pertaining to logistic support.  In particular, contractors will provide
prompt and accurate reporting of changes in employee status as required by this
regulation to the assigned sponsoring agency.

          h.  Invited contractor and technical representative status will be 
withdrawn by USFK on--

                (1) Completion or termination of the contract.

                (2) Proof that the contractor or employees are engaged in
business activities in the ROK other than those pertaining to US armed forces.

                (3) Proof that the contractor or employees are engaged in
practices illegal in the ROK or are violating USFK regulations.

          i.  It is agreed that the withdrawal of the invited-contractor or
technical-representative status or any of the privileges associated therewith by
the US Government, will not constitute grounds for excusable delay by the
contractor in the performance of the contract, nor will it justify or excuse the
contractor defaulting the performance of this contract; and such withdrawal will
not serve as a basis for the filing of any claims against the US Government if
the withdrawal is made for the reasons stated in subparagraph h above.  Under no
circumstances will the withdrawal of such status or privileges be considered or
construed as a breach of contract by the US Government.  The determination to
withdraw SOFA status and privileges by USFK shall be final and binding on the
parties unless it is patently arbitrary, capricious, and lacking in good faith.

13.  OPTION TO EXTEND CONTRACT PERFORMANCE

extension of performance hereunder shall not exceed six (6) months.  The
Contracting Officer may exercise the option by written notice to the contractor
not later than 15 days prior to expiration of the contract.  The Government's
rights under this paragraph are in addition to those under CLIN 0004 of SECTION
B.

15.  5352.223-9004 SAFETY AND ACCIDENT PREVENTION (APR 1984) AFFARS

          a. In performing work under this contract on a Government 
installation, the Contractor shall--

                (1) Conform to the specific safety requirement established by
this contract;

                (2) Comply with the safety rules of the Government
installation that concern related activities not directly addressed in this
contract;

                (3) Take all reasonable steps and precautions to prevent
accidents and preserve the life and health of Contractor and Government
personnel performing or in any way coming in contact with the performance of
this contract; and

                (4) Take such additional immediate precautions as the
Contracting Officer may reasonably require for safety and accident prevention
purposes.

          b.  If this contract is performed on an Air Force installation, the
Air Force Occupational Safety and Health (AFOSH) Standards developed in
accordance with AFR 127- 12, in effect on the date of this contract, apply.  If
contract performance is on other than an Air Force installation, the Contractor
shall comply with the safety rules of that Government installation, in effect on
the date of this contract.

          c.  The Contracting Officer may, by written order, direct additional
AFOSH and safety and accident standards as may be required in the performance of
this contract and any adjustments resulting from such direction will be in
accordance with the Changes clause of this contract.

          d.  Any violation of these safety rules and requirements, unless
promptly corrected as directed by the Contracting Officer, shall be grounds for
termination of this contract in accordance with the "Default" clause of this
contract.

16.  5352.247-1000 AIR SAFETY (NOV 1991) AMCFARS

          a.  Contractor is obligated to comply with generally accepted
standards of airmanship, training, and maintenance practices and procedures.
Contractor must also satisfy DOD quality and safety requirements as described in
32 CFR Part 861 Section 861.3.  In addition, contractor shall comply with all
provisions of applicable statutes, tenders of service, and contract terms, as
such may affect flight safety, as well as with all applicable Federal Aviation
Administration Regulations, Air worthiness Directives, Orders, Rules, and
Standards promulgated under the Federal Aviation Act of 1958, as amended.
Compliance with published standards may not, standing alone, constitute
compliance with generally accepted standards of airmanship, training or
maintenance.

          b.  The cleanliness and orderliness of an aircraft, including the
visible components and surfaces thereof affect the ability to inspect an
aircraft, may be valid indicators of the overall maintenance level of an
          ------                                                        
aircraft, and may have a direct effect on the security and confidence of
              --------                                                  
passengers.  Therefore, Contractor's failure to keep and maintain all such
components and surfaces of the aircraft used in performance of this contract
clean, orderly, and in a good state of repair, may be deemed a failure to comply
                                               ---------------------------------
with generally accepted standards of maintenance to the extent the failures go
- ------------------------------------------------------------------------------
beyond mere cosmetic or housekeeping deficiencies and relate in some manner to
- ------------------------------------------------------------------------------
confidence in the safety, maintenance or air worthiness of the aircraft.
- ------------------------------------------------------------------------

          c.  Should the Government determine that any of the following
conditions exist, it may suspend or place in temporary nonuse status
Contractor's further performance of airlift transportation services for the
Department of Defense:

H-16
<PAGE>
 
                (1) Contractor's failure to meet any of the obligations
imposed by the preceding two paragraphs;

                (2) Involvement of one of Contractor's aircraft in a serious
or fatal accident, incident, or operational occurrence (regardless of whether
or not such aircraft is being used in the performance of this contract);

                (3) Any other condition which affects the safe operation of
Contractor's flights hereunder.

          d.  Such suspension shall be accomplished pursuant to the Air Mobility
Command (AMC) and Military Traffic Management Command (MTMC) Commercial Airlift
Safety Review Procedures (32 CFR Part 861), which are hereby incorporated in
this contract by reference, or any procedures that supersede same which may be
adopted by HQ AMC/MTMC from time-to-time.  The suspension procedures, including
the temporary nonuse, reinstatement, and appeals processes, set out therein, are
binding, final, and conclusive.  In no event shall suspension or temporary
nonuse proceedings, regardless of outcome, give rise to any liability on the
part of the Government.

          e.  Suspension or temporary nonuse hereunder resulting in
unavailability of Contractor aircraft to perform service under this contract
shall be treated as failure to maintain authorization to engage in air
transportation under the clause of the contract entitled, "REQUIREMENT FOR
AUTHORIZATION TO ENGAGE IN AIR TRANSPORTATION."

17.  5352.247-1001 REQUIREMENT FOR AUTHORIZATION TO ENGAGE IN AIR TRANSPORTATION
(MAR 1988) AMCFARS

            a.  This contract is conditioned upon the Contractor being an air
carrier and holding a Certificate of Public Convenience and Necessity issued
under Section 401 of the Federal Aviation Act (FAA of 1958, as amended), or is
otherwise authorized by the DOT to engage in air transportation services,
holding an Air Carrier's Operating Certificate issued by the FAA under Part 121
of the Federal Aviation Regulations (14 CFR 121) for airlift operated by the
offeror (or in the case of a joint venture, the entity of the joint venture
operating the aircraft), and participating in the CRAF, if applicable.
Furthermore, the Contractor shall not be in a suspension or temporary nonuse
status in accordance with the special clause in SECTION H entitled "AIR SAFETY."

          b.  If at any time during the performance period of this contract the
Contractor is not in compliance with the requirements of paragraph a above,
including, but not limited to, instances when the certificate demonstrating
compliance with paragraph a above is, (i) suspended by the pertinent regulatory
body for any period of time even though the effect of the suspension is stayed
pending review by a court of competent jurisdiction, (ii) canceled or revoked in
its entirety by the pertinent regulatory body even though the effect of the
cancellation or revocation is stayed pending review by a court of competent
jurisdiction, or (iii) such certificate or interim operating authority has
expired and has not been renewed, then the Contracting Officer may elect any one
or a combination of the following courses of action:

                (1) Suspend the Contractor from further performance of all or
any part of this contract until such time as the suspension/temporary nonuse
imposed by the pertinent regulatory body shall have expired or until such time
as the suspension, temporary nonuse, cancellation, or revocation shall have
been finally set aside, removed, or otherwise terminated. The period of
suspension of this contract will begin at the time that notice thereof is
given by the Contracting Officer to the Contractor's designee named in
accordance with paragraph entitled, "Contractor Point of Contact" in SECTION G
of this contract. All flights which were scheduled to be flown during the time
any such suspension is in effect will be canceled. A unilateral modification
reflecting the cancellation and reducing the Government's obligation
accordingly will be issued by the Contracting Officer at the Termination of
the period during which this contract is suspended or after the expiration of
the period of performance of this contract. Any 

H-17
<PAGE>
 
such cancellation is not for the convenience of the Government and is not a
termination within the meaning of the clause entitled "Termination for
Convenience of the Government (Fixed-Price)." Such cancellation will be
accomplished at no cost to either party, and the substitute service provisions
of this contract will not apply to such canceled flights.

                (2) Exercise the Government's rights under the special clause
of the contract entitled, "Contractor's Failure to Provide Service."

                (3) Terminate this contract in whole or in part under the
procedures of the clause entitled "Default." If this contract is terminated
for default pursuant to paragraph b, and if it is subsequently determined that
termination for default is not appropriate, this contract shall then be
considered to have been canceled pursuant to subparagraph b(4) below.

                (4) Cancel this contract in whole or in part. Any such
cancellation will be accomplished by the issuance of a unilateral modification
and will not be a termination under the provisions of the clause entitled
"Termination for Convenience of the Government (Fixed-Price)" and neither
party will be liable to the other party for costs incurred as a result of such
cancellation.

18.  SUBMISSION OF COST AND PRICING DATA--MOU

          Contractors who are required to submit certified cost and pricing data
pursuant to the MOU shall do so within the time specified by HQ AMC/LGC.
Failure to provide certified cost and pricing data within the defined time shall
result in a reduction of such offerors' entitlement for the purpose of awarding
business for the forecast year.  Mobilization points shall be reduced at a rate
of one percentage point per day late, up to a maximum reduction of 30 percent.
Requirements for submission of certified cost and pricing data are addressed in
the MOU and procedures defined in FAR 52.215-10 entitled "Late Submissions,
Modifications, and Withdrawal of Proposals."

19.  REQUIREMENT FOR INDEMNIFICATION APPROVAL

          Notwithstanding the inclusion of FAR Clause 52.250-1 and the clause
entitled Definition of Unusually Hazardous Risk in Section I (paras 4 & 5) they
have no force and effect in this contract until the contracting officer notifies
the contractor by modification that indemnification has been approved by the

     (d)  In making the certification in paragraph (2) of the certificate,
the officer or employee of the competing Contractor responsible for the offer or
bid, may rely upon a one-time certification from each individual required to
submit a certification to the competing Contractor, supplemented by periodic
training.  These certifications shall be obtained at the earliest possible date
after an individual required to certify begins employment or association with
the contractor.  If a contractor decides to rely on a certification executed
prior to the suspension of section 27 (i.e., prior to December 1, 1989), the
Contractor shall ensure that an individual who has so certified is notified that
section 27 has been reinstated.  These certifications shall be maintained by the
Contractor for a period of 6 years from the date a certifying employee's
employment with the company ends or, for an agency, representative, or
consultant, 6 years from the date such individual ceases to act on behalf of the
contractor.

     (e) The certification required by paragraph (c) of this clause is a
material representation of fact upon which reliance will be placed in
executing this modification.

FRAUD  (JAN 1992) DFARS

     (a)  10 U.S.C. 2307(e) permits the head of the agency to reduce or
suspend advance, partial, or progress payments upon a written determination by
the agency head that substantial evidence exists that the Contractor's request
for payment is based on fraud.  The provisions of 10 U.S.C. 2307(e) are in
addition to any other rights or remedies provided by the Government by law or
under contract.

     (b)  Actions taken by the Government under 10 U.S.C. 2307(e) shall not
constitute an excusable delay under the Default clause of this contract or
otherwise relieve the Contractor of its obligations to perform under this
contract.

4.  52.250-1 INDEMNIFICATION UNDER PUBLIC LAW 85-804  (APR 1984) FAR

     (a)  "Contractor's principal officials," as used in this clause, means
directors, officers, managers, superintendents, or other representatives
supervising or directing--

          (1)  All or substantially all of the Contractor's business;

          (2)  All or substantially all of the Contractor's operations at any
one plant or separate location in which this contract is being performed; or

          (3)  A separate and complete major industrial operation in

     (b)  Under Public Law 85-804 (50 U.S.C. 1431-1435) and Executive Order
10789, as amended, and regardless of any other provisions of this contract, the
Government shall, subject to the limitations contained in the other paragraphs
of this clause, indemnify the Contractor against--

          (1)  Claims (including reasonable expenses of litigation or
settlement) by third persons (including employees of the Contractor) for death;
personal injury; or loss of, damage to, or loss of use of property;

          (2) Loss of, damage to, or loss of use of Contractor property,
excluding loss of profit; and

          (3) Loss of, damage to, or loss of use of Government property,
excluding loss of profit .

loss, or damage (1) arises out of or results from a risk defined in this
contract as unusually hazardous or nuclear and (2) is not compensated for by



I-5
<PAGE>
 
insurance or otherwise.  Any such claim, loss, or damage, to the extent that it
is within the deductible amounts of the Contractor's insurance, is not covered
under this clause.  If insurance coverage or other financial protection in
effect on the date the approving official authorizes use of this clause is
reduced, the Government's liability under this clause shall not increase as a
result.

     (d)  When the claim, loss, or damage is caused by willful misconduct
or lack of good faith on the part of any of the Contractor's principal
officials, the Contractor shall not be indemnified for--

          (1)  Government claims against the Contractor (other than those 
arising through subrogation); or

          (2)  Loss or damage affecting the Contractor's property.

     (e)  With the Contracting Officer's prior written approval, the
Contractor may, in any subcontract under this contract, indemnify the

or nuclear.  This indemnification shall provide, between the Contractor and the
subcontractor, the same rights and duties, and the same provisions for notice,
furnishing of evidence or proof, and Government settlement or defense of claims
as this clause provides.  The Contracting Officer may also approve
indemnification of subcontractors at any lower tier, under the same terms and
conditions.  The Government shall indemnify the Contractor against liability to
subcontractors incurred under subcontract provisions approved by the Contracting
Officer.

     (f)  The rights and obligations of the parties under this clause shall
survive this contract's termination, expiration, or completion.  The Government
shall make no payment under this clause unless the agency head determines that
the amount is just and reasonable.  The Government may pay the Contractor or
subcontractors, or may directly pay parties to whom the Contractor or
subcontractors may be liable.

     (g)  The Contractor shall--

          (1)  Promptly notify the Contracting Officer of any claim or action

5.  DEFINITION OF UNUSUALLY HAZARDOUS RISK

1.  Definitions:

     A.  "Civil Reserve Air Fleet (CRAF) Mission" means the provision of
airlift services under this contract (1) ordered pursuant to authority available
because of the activation of CRAF or (2) directed by Commander in Chief, US
Transportation Command (USCINCTRANS), or his successor for missions
substantially similar to or in lieu of those ordered pursuant to formal CRAF
activation.

     B.  "Airlift Services" means all services (passenger, cargo, or
medical evacuation) and anything the contractor is required to do in order to
conduct or position the aircraft, personnel, supplies, and equipment for a

I-6
<PAGE>
 
flight and return.  Airlift Services include Senior Lodger and other ground
related services supporting CRAF missions.  Airlift Services do not include any
services involving any persons or things which, at the time of the event, act,
or omission giving rises to a claim, are directly supporting commercial business
operations unrelated to a CRAF mission objective.

     C.  "War risks" means risks of:

          (1)  War (including war between the Great Powers), invasion, acts of
foreign enemies, hostilities (whether declared or not), civil war, rebellion,
revolution, insurrection, martial law, military or usurped power, or attempt at
usurpation of power.

          (2)  Any hostile detonation of any weapon of war employing atomic or
nuclear fission and/or fusion or other like reaction or radioactive force or
matter.

          (3)  Strikes, riots, civil commotion's, or labor disturbances 
related to occurrences under subparagraph (1) above.

          (4)  Any act of one or more persons, whether or not agents of a
sovereign power, for political or terrorist purposes and whether the loss or
damage resulting therefrom is accidental or intentional, except for ransom or
extortion demands.

          (5)  Any malicious act or act of sabotage, vandalism, or other act 
intended to cause loss or damage.

          (6)  Confiscation, nationalization, seizure, restraint, detention,
appropriation, requisition for title or use by or under the order of any
Government (whether civil or military or de facto) or public or local authority.

          (7)  Hijacking or any unlawful seizure or wrongful exercise of control
of the aircraft or crew (including any attempt at such seizure or control) made
by any person or persons on board the aircraft or otherwise, acting without the
consent of the insured.

          (8)  The discharge or detonation of a weapon or hazardous material
while on the aircraft as cargo or in the personal baggage of any passenger.

2.  For the purpose of the contract clause entitled "Indemnification Under
Public Law 85-804 (APR 1984)," it is agreed that all war risks resulting from
the provision of airlift services for a CRAF mission in accordance with the
contract are unusually hazardous risks, and shall be indemnified to the extent
that such risks are not covered by insurance procured under Title XIII of the
Federal Aviation Act or other insurance, because such insurance has been
canceled, has applicable exclusions, or has been determined by the government to
be prohibitive in cost.  The government's liability to indemnify the contractor
shall not exceed that amount for which the contractor commercially insures under
its established policies of insurance.

     a.  Notwithstanding the above, indemnification for liability or loss
is provided for coverage in excess of the amounts the Contractor  has agreed to
insure pursuant to the contract should government action or omission cause the
Contractor to lose the protection of loss limitations under the Warsaw
Convention/Montreal Agreements whether or not the claim is related to war risks
and regardless of policy limits.

     b.  Indemnification is provided for personal injury and death claims
resulting from the transportation of medical evacuation patients whether or not
the claim is related to war risks.

3.  Indemnification of risks involving the operation of aircraft, as discussed
above, is limited to claims or losses arising out of events, acts, or omissions
involving the operation of an aircraft for airlift services for a CRAF 



I-7
<PAGE>
 
mission, from the time that aircraft is withdrawn from the contractor's regular
operations (commercial, DOD, or other activity unrelated to airlift services for
a CRAF mission) until it is returned for regular operations.  Indemnification
with regard to other contractor personnel or property utilized or services
rendered in support of CRAF missions is limited to claims or losses arising out
of events, acts, or omissions occurring during the time the first pre-
positioning of personnel, supplies and equipment to support the first aircraft
of the contractor used for airlift services for a CRAF mission is commenced
until the timely removal of such personnel, supplies and equipment after the
last such aircraft is returned for regular operations.

4.  Indemnification, is contingent upon the Contractor maintaining, if
available, non premium insurance under Title XIII of the Federal Aviation Act
and normal commercial insurance, as required by this contract or by other
competent authority.  Indemnification for losses covered by a contractor self-
insurance program shall only be on such terms as incorporated in this contract
by the contracting officer in advance of such a loss.

6.  252.223-7004 DRUG-FREE WORK FORCE (SEP 1988/DFARS)

  (a)  Definitions.  (1)  Employee in a sensitive position, as used in this
clause, means an employee who has been granted access to classified information;
or employees in other positions that the Contractor determines involve national
security, health or safety, or functions other than the foregoing requiring a
high degree of trust and confidence.

     (2)  Illegal drugs, as used in this clause, means controlled substances
included in Schedules I and II, as defined by section 802(6) of title 21 of the
United States Code, the possession of which is unlawful under chapter 13 of that
Title.  The term "illegal drugs" does not mean the use of a controlled substance
pursuant to a valid prescription or other uses authorized by law.

  (b)  The Contractor agrees to institute and maintain a program for achieving
the objective of a drug-free work force.  While this clause defines criteria for
such a program, contractors are encouraged to implement alternative approaches
comparable to the criteria in paragraph (c) that are designed to achieve the
objectives of this clause.

  (c)  Contractor programs shall include the following, or appropriate
alternatives:

     (1)  Employee assistance programs emphasizing high level direction,
education. counseling, rehabilitation, and coordination with available community
resources;

     (2)  Supervisory  training to assist in identifying and addressing illegal
drug use by Contractor employees;

     (3)  Provision for self-referrals as well as supervisory referrals to
treatment with maximum respect for individual confidentiality consistent with
safety and security issues;

     (4)  Provision for identifying illegal drug users, including testing on a
controlled and carefully monitored basis.  Employee drug testing programs shall
be established taking account of the following:

        (i)  The Contractor shall establish a program that provides for testing
for the use of illegal drugs by employees in sensitive positions.  The extent of
and criteria for such testing shall be determined by the Contractor based on
considerations that include the nature of the work being performed under the
contract, the employee's duties, the efficient use of Contractor resources, and
the risks to health, safety, or national security that could result from the
failure of an employee adequately to discharge his or her position.

        (ii) In addition, the Contractor may establish a program for employee
drug testing-
           (A)  When there is a reasonable suspicion that an employee uses
illegal drugs; or
           (B)  When an employee has been involved in an accident or unsafe
practice;
           (C)  As part of or as a follow-up to counseling or rehabilitation for
illegal drug use;
           (D)  As part of a voluntary employee drug testing program.
        (iii) The Contractor may establish a program to test applicants for
employment for illegal drug use.

        (iv) For the purpose of administering this clause, testing for illegal
drugs may be limited to those substances for which testing is prescribed by
section 2.1 of subpart B of the "Mandatory Guidelines for Federal Workplace Drug
Testing Programs" (53 FR 11980 (April 11 1988)), issued by the Department of
Health and Human Services.

  (d)  Contractors shall adopt appropriate personnel procedures to deal with
employees who are found to be using drugs illegally.  Contractors shall not
allow any employee to remain on duty or perform in a sensitive position who is
found to use illegal drugs until such times as the Contractor, in accordance
with procedures established by the Contractor, determines that the employee may
perform in such a position.

  (e)  The provisions of this clause pertaining to drug testing program shall
not apply to the extent they are inconsistent with state or local law, or with
an existing collective bargaining agreement; provided that with respect to the
latter, the Contractor agrees that those issues that are in conflict will be
subject of negotiation at the next collective bargaining session.

payment amount is subject to contract settlement actions, acceptance shall be 
deemed to have occurred on the effective date of the contract settlement. 
However, if the designated billing office fails to annotate the invoice with 
the actual date of receipt, the invoice payment due date shall be deemed to be
the 30th day after the date the Contractor's invoice is dated, provided a 
proper invoice is received and there is no disagreement over quantity, quality,
or Contractor compliance with contract requirements.

            (3)  The due date on contracts for meat, meat food products, or 
fish; contracts for perishable agricultural commodities, contracts for dairy

7th day after product delivery.

                 (ii) The due date for fresh or frozen fish, as defined in 
Section 204(3) of the Fish and Seafood Promotion Act of 1986 (16 U.S.C. 
4003(3)), will be as close as possible to, but not later than, the seventh day

the 10th day after product delivery, unless another date is specified in the 
contract.

                 (iv) The due date for dairy products, as defined in section 
111(e) of the Dairy Production Stabilization Act of 1983 (7 U.S.C. 4502(e)),

be as close as possible to, but not later than, the 10th day after the date on
which a proper invoice has been received.

                 (v)  If the contract does not require submission of an 
invoice for payment (e.g., periodic lease payments), the due date will be as 
specified in the contract.

            (4)  An invoice is the Contractor's bill or written request for 
payment under the contract for supplies delivered or services performed. An 
invoice shall be prepared and submitted to the designated billing office 
specified in the contract. A proper invoice must include the items listed in 
subdivisions (a)(4)(i) through (a)(4)(viii) of this clause. If the invoice 
does not comply with these requirements, then the Contractor will be
 
I-9
 
<PAGE>
 
notified of the defect within 7 days after receipt of the invoice at the 
designated billing office (3 days for meat, meat food products, or fish, and 5
days for perishable agricultural commodities, edible fats or oils, and food 
products prepared from edible fats or oils). Untimely notification will be 
taken into account in the computation of any interest penalty owed the 
Contractor in the manner described in subparagraph (a)(6) of this clause.

          (i)  Name and address of the Contractor

          (ii) Invoice date

          (iii) Contract number or other authorization for supplies delivered 
or services performed (including order number and contract line item number).

          (iv) Description, quantity, unit of measure, unit price, and extended
price of supplies delivered or services performed.

          (v) Shipping and payment terms (e.g., shipment number and date of 
shipment, prompt payment discount terms). Bill of lading number and weight of 
shipment will be shown for shipments will be shown for shipments on Government 
bills of lading.

          (vi)  Name and address of Contractor official to whom payment is to 
be sent (must be the same as that in the contract or in a proper notice of 
assignment).

          (vii) Name (where practicable), title, phone number and mailing 
address of person to be notified.

          (viii) Any other information or documentation required by other 
requirements of the contract (such as evidence of shipment).

      (5)  An interest penalty shall be paid automatically by the Government,
without request from the Contractor, if payment is not made by the due date 
and the conditions listed in subdivisions (a)(5)(i) through (a)(5)(iii) of 
this clause are met, if applicable.

           (i)  A proper invoice was received by the designated billing office.

           (ii) A receiving report or other Government documentation 
authorizing payment was processed and there was no disagreement over quantity,
quality, or contractor compliance with any contract term or condition.

           (iii) In the case of a final invoice for any balance of funds due 
the Contractor for supplies delivered or services performed, the amount was 
not subject to further contract settlement actions between the Government and 
the Contractor.

      (6)  the interest penalty shall be at the rate established by the 
Secretary of the Treasury under section 12 of the Contract Disputes Act of 
1978 (41 U.S.C. 611) that is in effect on the day after the due date, except 
where the interest penalty is prescribed by other governmental authority. This
rate is referred to as the "Renegotiation Board Interest Rate," and it is 
published in the Federal Register semiannually on or about January 1 and July
1. The interest penalty shall accrue daily on the invoice payment amount 
approved by the Government and be compounded in 30-day increments inclusive 
from the first day after the due date through the payment date. That is, 
interest accrued at the end of any 30-day period will be added to the approved
invoice payment amount and be subject to interest penalties if not paid in the
succeeding 30-day period. If the designated billing office failed to notify 
the contractor of a defective invoice within the periods prescribed in 
subparagraph (a)(4) of this clause then the due date on the corrected invoice 
will be adjusted by subtracting the number of days taken beyond. Any interest 
penalty owed the Contractor will be based on this adjusted due date. 
Adjustments will be made by the designated payment office for errors in 
calculating interest penalties, if requested by the Contractor.

           (i)  For the sole purpose of computing an interest penalty that 
might be due the Contractor, Government acceptance shall be deemed to have 
occurred constructively on the 7th day (unless otherwise specified in this 
contract) after the Contractor delivered the supplies or performed the 
services in accordance with the terms and conditions of the contract, unless 
there is a disagreement over quantity, quality, or contractor compliance with 
a contract provision.  In the event that actual acceptance occurs within the 
constructive acceptance period, the determination of an interest penalty shall
be based on the actual date of acceptance. The constructive acceptance 
requirement does not, however, compel Government officials to accept supplies 
or services, perform contract requirement does not, however, compel Government
officials to accept supplies or services, perform contract administration 
functions, or make payment prior to fulfilling their responsibilities.

           (ii)  The following periods of time will not be included in the 
determination of an interest penalty:

I-10
<PAGE>
 
                     (A)  The period taken to notify the Contractor of defects
in invoices submitted to the Government, but this may not exceed 7 days (3 
days for meat, meat food products, or fish, and 5 days for perishable 
agricultural commodities, dairy products, edible fats or oils, and food 
products prepared from edible fats or oils).

                     (B)  The period between the defects notice and 
resubmission of the corrected invoice by the Contractor.

              (iii)  Interest penalties will not continue to accrue after the 
filing of a claim for such penalties under the clause at 52.233-1.  Disputes, 
or for more than 1 year.  Interest penalties of less than $1.00 need not be 

              (iv)   Interest penalties are not required on payment delays due
to disagreement between the Government and Contractor over the payment amount 
or other issues involving contract compliance or on amounts temporarily 
withheld or retained in accordance with the terms of the contract.  Claims 
involving disputes, and any interest that may be payable, will be resolved in 
accordance with the clause at 52.233-1.  Disputes.

          (7) An interest penalty shall also be paid automatically by the 
designated payment office, without request from the Contractor, if a discount
for prompt payment is taken improperly.  The interest penalty will be 
calculated as described insubparagraph (a)(6) of this clause on the amount of 
discount taken for the period beginning with the first day after the end of 
the discount period through the date when the Contractor is paid.  

          (8) If this contract was awarded on or after October 1, 1989, a 
penalty amount, calculated in accordance with regulations issued by the 
Office of Management and Budget, shall be paid in addition to the interest 
penalty amount if the Contractor:

              (i)   Is owed an interest penalty;
              (ii)  Is not paid the interest penalty within 10 days after the 
date the invoice amount is paid; and  
              (iii) Makes a written demand, not later than 40 days after the 
date in invoice amount is paid, that the agency pay such a penalty.

       (b)  Contract financing payments

            (1)  For purposes of this clause, "contract financing payment" 
means a Government disbursement of monies to a Contractor under a contract 
clause or other authorization prior to acceptance of supplies of services by 
the Government.  Contract financing payments include advance payment, progress
payments based on cost under the clause at 52.232.16, Progress Payments, 
progress payments based on a percentage or stage of completion (132.102(e)(1))

for payment shall be submitted to the designated billing office as specified 
in this contract or as directed by the Contracting Officer.  Contract 
financing payments shall be made on the 30th say after receipt of a proper 
contract financing request by the designated billing office.  In the event 
that an audit or other review of a specific financing request is required to 
ensure compliance with the terms and conditions of the contract, the 
designated payment office is not compelled to make payment by the due date

1.5.2.  LATE CONUS ARRIVAL:  In the event any contractor flight is delayed at
        ------------------                                                   
any point and (a) the passenger mission arrives the CONUS 4 hours or more after
scheduled arrival time; (b) actual arrival time is later than 2000 hours local;
and (c) late arrival is due to controllable reasons, the Contractor shall be
required to care for passengers who are unable to make onward travel connections
due to the late arrival.  The Contractor shall provide the following care:
overnight billeting, hot meals, and transportation to and from the meal and
billeting areas.

1.5.3.  OTHER CONTRACTOR CONTROLLABLE DELAYS:  In the event a flight is delayed
        ------------------------------------                                   
and the delay is contractor controllable, the Contractor shall provide hot meals
and transportation to the feeding point if the delay extends over a meal period
for all passengers manifested at the close-out time of the flight at the delay
station, and all space required passengers that check in at enroute stations.
If a controllable delay requires an overnight stay, the Contractor is
responsible for meals, transportation, and billeting at the origin, enroute and
destination stations (if applicable).  The Contractor is responsible only for
those passengers manifested at the scheduled manifest close-out time.  Overnight
billeting will be considered when the delay is more than 4 hours, or crew rest
is required due to the length of the delay, or a passenger convenience delay is
declared.  A passenger convenience delay and/or overnight billeting
determination will be declared only by a Contracting Officer at 21/22 AF
Operating Location or HQ AMC/XOK.  Slot time requirements at all airfields,
etc., shall be made by the appropriate personnel prior to declaring a passenger
convenience delay or overnight billeting.

1.5.4.  DIVERSIONS.
        ---------- 

1.5.4.1.  If the Contractor overflies an enroute station due to Contractor
controllable reasons, the passengers awaiting transportation at the overflown
station and the passengers who were to be off-loaded at the overflown station
are the responsibility of the Contractor.  This includes passenger care and
transportation to manifested destination.

1.5.4.2.  If the Contractor overflies an enroute station due to a diversion, the
passengers awaiting pickup at the enroute station are the responsibility of AMC.
However, the Contractor is responsible for care of the passengers on the
aircraft who were to be off-loaded at the overflown enroute station until they
are delivered by the Contractor at Contractor's expense to the manifested
destination; or until such time as the Government provides suitable air
transportation.  The Contracting Officer  or his representative will coordinate
with the carrier's representative and arrange transportation for the delayed
passengers as soon as possible on the first military or contract flight, if
possible.  Whenever suitable transportation is available but not used, the
passengers become the responsibility of AMC.  With the approval of the
Contracting Officer or representative, the carrier may decide to move the
overflown passengers by air or suitable ground transportation to the overflown
station or care for the passengers until the Government provides suitable air or
other transportation.  For a turnaround station without any other traffic stops
within the same general area, the Contracting Officer or representative may
authorize the Contractor to provide ground transportation from the diversion
point to and from the turnaround point.

the possession of passengers exists only for the loss, damage, or destruction
occasioned by aircraft accident or otherwise caused by the  Contractor.  Any
lower limitation of liability to which the Contractor might otherwise be
entitled will not be applicable and the provisions of this paragraph will
prevail over any such lower limitation.  (Claims for lost or damaged baggage

     -------------------------

                                Page 7 of 11
<PAGE>
 
2.4.1  The 'Maximum Standard Payload' as used by AMC in its Uniform Negotiated
Rates and Rules, is the same as the Guaranteed Allowable Cabin Load (GACL or
ACL).  The GACL is the number of seats and/or weight of cargo for which the
Contractor guarantees to make capacity available to the Government.  The
Government agrees to use this amount as the price basis regardless of whether
the Government utilizes the full guaranteed capacity on any given flight.

2.4.2.  AMC will utilize up to the maximum standard ACL of passengers and their
allowable baggage.  In order to maximize the benefits of the standard ACL, the
carrier shall  not be allowed to block off any area of the aircraft for nonuse
or load route support crew or equipment (as authorized by the ACO in Section C,
para 13), over the maximum standard ACL.

2.5.  ON-LOADING.
      ---------- 

2.5.1.  The Government will load according to the Contractor provided, planned
load breakdown and is responsible for the accuracy of the actual on-load weights
provided to the Contractor and entered on the local station load summary, or
Contractor's form, by loading supervisor.  The Contractor (aircraft commander or
other designated crew member) is responsible for visually checking the cargo
load, its security and tie-down so that FAA requirements are met.

2.5.2.  PASSENGER MISSION ON-LOADING AT A MILITARY INSTALLATION.  The
        -------------------------------------------------------      
Contractor's representative shall  provide the Government with the aircraft
capability in both pounds and seats based upon the critical leg of the mission,
3 hours prior to departure time.  The Contractor may use the station's local
load summary form or Contractor's form.  As a minimum, the following shall  be
shown:

2.5.2.1.  Trip number/date.

2.5.2.2.  Type aircraft.

2.5.2.3.  ACL in passenger seats/pounds this leg.

2.5.2.4.  ACL in passenger seats/pounds critical leg.

2.5.2.5.  Cube allowable in the belly compartments.

2.4.2.6.  Belly compartment weight by compartment.

2.5.3.  The Contractor's representative shall sign the local station load
planning form to indicate receipt of actual load breakdown.

2.5.4.  Contractor shall furnish seat selection charts conforming to the
configuration and seat numbering system of its aircraft, to the QAE at
originating and turnaround stations for each Category B mission.  Seat selection
charts must clearly identify the location of all emergency exits.  Where
required seat spacing results in less rows of seats than are indicated in the
aircraft's overhead numbering system, the excess row numbers/seats should be
blanked out, with tape or otherwise, to minimize confusion.  No smoking area
shall  be indicated on the charts.  The flight attendant or contractor
representative shall  check boarding passes as passengers board the aircraft.
In case of a discrepancy, the Contractor shall  immediately advise the
Government in order to resolve the discrepancy.

2.5.5.  The Government shall be entitled to have transported, on each all-
passenger flight and each mixed flight, 70 pounds of personal baggage (and/or
mail, courier material, cargo) for each passenger carried.  If for reasons
caused by the Contractor, the Contractor can not transport all of such baggage,
the Government may withhold passengers (and their baggage) whose baggage can not
be carried and charge the Contractor a deficit for those
 

                                Page 8 of 11
<PAGE>
 
passengers pursuant to SECTION G. The Government may require the Contractor to
transport courier material, mail, additional baggage in any amount not in
excess of 245 pounds multiplied by the difference between the number of
passengers furnished by the Government and the passenger ACL. Mail and cargo
required to be transported will be of such weight and configuration as to fit
readily in otherwise unused space within the cargo or baggage compartment of
the aircraft, or both, without the interference with baggage stowage; and
mail, baggage, or cargo will not be stowed in the cabin or passenger
compartment.

2.5.6.  The following standardized weights are used by DOD units for planning of
movements.

2.5.6.1.  NORMAL PASSENGER LOADS.  This is a mixed load of military members and
          ----------------------                                               
their dependents.  This load is very similar to that experienced by civil
carriers on scheduled flights.  The DOD uses weights in accordance with FAA AC
120-27A; i.e., adults -- 175 pounds; children 2 to 12 - 80 pounds; plus 70
pounds checked baggage.  TOTAL:  Adults - 245 pounds.

2.5.6.2.  NONCOMBAT EQUIPPED MILITARY PERSONNEL.  A full load of military
          -------------------------------------                          
personnel, without spouses and children, and without combat equipment.  The DOD
uses 175 pounds plus 20 pounds of hand carried baggage, plus 70 pounds of
checked baggage.  TOTAL:  265 pounds.

2.5.6.3.  COMBAT EQUIPPED MILITARY PERSONNEL.  This represents the standard
          ----------------------------------                               
combat soldier as would be seen in large exercise movements such as REFORGER,
TEAM SPIRIT, BRIGHT STAR, etc.

2.5.6.3.1  Combat-equipped troops with carry-on baggage and 70 pounds of checked
baggage:  280 pounds.

2.5.6.3.2  Combat-equipped troops with web gear and weapon, carry on baggage and
70 pounds of checked baggage:  302 pounds.

2.5.6.3.3  Combat-equipped troops with web gear, weapon, carry-on baggage, ruck
sack and 70 pounds of checked baggage:  380 pounds.

2.5.6.3.4  Actual scaled weights of individuals with uniform, boots, helmet,
weapon, web gear, and hand-carried baggage will be used in lieu of standard body
weights.  If scales are not available, interrogated weights of individuals can
be used.  Use the following additive item weights to determine the total weight
of the individual:

                  - Boots:  5 pounds
                  - Helmet:  5 pounds
                  - Uniform:  5 pounds
                  - Web Gear:  12 pounds
                  - Weapon:  10 pounds
                  - Hand-carried Baggage:  20 pounds

2.5.6.4.  Contractors may request interrogated weights of passengers and baggage
8 hours prior to positioning for the flight.  DOD users moving on
SAAMs/Exercises will weight all LD-3 containers and 463-L pallets and loose
loaded baggage prior to loading in aircraft baggage pits and will furnish those
weights to carrier personnel.

2.5.7.  Carriers shall  insure that their ground handlers meet the following
baggage off- load times:

                                Page 9 of 11
<PAGE>
 
        NUMBER OF PASSENGERS ON AIRCRAFT    TIME

             1-189                       45 minutes
             190-354                      1 hour
             355-499                    1.5 hours

2.5.8.  INFLIGHT MEAL SCHEDULE AND COMPLIANCE.  Contractor shall provide
        -------------------------------------                           
inflight meals equal to those provided to economy class passengers on scheduled
commercial passenger flights.  Menus will be approved by the ACO and shall  be
served in accordance with the schedule set forth in Attachment 3.

3.  SCHEDULED SERVICE.  In addition to the requirements stated in paragraph 1.
    -----------------                                                         
of this attachment, the following provisions are applicable specifically to the
performance of Scheduled Service operations.  Scheduled Service transportation
means the movement of passengers in scheduled service at the Scheduled Service
rate.

3.1.  SCHEDULING.
      ---------- 

3.1.1.  Scheduling travel under Scheduled Service herein may only be made by the
Airlift Mobility Command (AMC).  STOPOVER WILL NOT BE PERMITTED.  Within AMC,
only HQ AMC/XONR, (618)256-2277, is authorized to work with the Contractor's
representatives to make scheduling arrangements.

3.1.2.  The AMC passenger reservation centers will enter names into the airlines
Passenger Name Record (PNR) files as soon as they have them via the airlines
commercial reservations sets.  Once names are in the airline system individual
passengers shall be able to contact the Contractor, make seat selection, special
meal orders, etc.

3.1.3.  The Contractor shall arrange for ground transfer service on a
reimbursable basis between Tokyo International (Narita), Tokyo, and Yokota Air
Base, Japan.

3.2.  The free baggage allowance will be two pieces per passenger.  Authorized
baggage in excess of two pieces on a flight will be transported at contract's
standard commercial rates.  If a passenger has more baggage than authorized by
the MTA, contractor shall  collect the excess baggage charge from the passenger.
Pets will not be included in the passenger's free baggage allowance.  The entire
weight of the pet and the container shall  be charged for as excess baggage at
contractor's standard commercial rates.  Contractor shall  collect such charges
from the passenger.

3.3.  POOLED BAGGAGE.  All passengers traveling as a group (listed on the same
      --------------                                                          
MTA or under the same orders) to a common destination on the same flight shall
be permitted a total free baggage allowance equal to the 


                                Page 10 of 11
<PAGE>
 
combination of their individual free baggage allowances. Baggage in excess of
the combined free baggage allowance of the total number of passengers in that
group, who moved on the same flight, will be subject to charges for excess
baggage. Passengers with baggage in excess of the amount authorized on their
MTA or orders will pay the Contractor for the excess at rates specified.

3.4.  EXCESS VALUE CHARGES.
      -------------------- 

3.4.1  A value for baggage in excess of $20.00 per kilogram (2.2 lbs) may be
declared by the passenger.  When such declaration is made, a charge for value in
excess of $20.00 per kilogram (2.2 lbs) will be assessed by each Contractor
participating in the carriage, at the rate of $.50 for each $100.00 of excess
value of fraction thereof up to a maximum total valuation of $5000.00.

3.4.2.  Excess value charges are payable by the passenger and will not be paid
by the U.S. Government.

3.4.3.  Valuation Limit of Baggage.  No baggage of any one passenger having a
declared value in excess of $5000 will be accepted for carriage unless special
arrangements therefore have been made in advance between the passenger and
Contractor(s) concerned.

3.4.4.  Collection of Excess Value Charges.  Excess value charges will be
payable at the point of origin for the entire journey to final destination;
provided, that if at a stopover enroute, a passenger declares a higher excess
value than that originally declared, additional excess value charges for the
increased value from the stopover at which the higher excess value was declared
to final destination will be payable.

3.4.5  Payment of Baggage Charges.  Contractor will not be obligated to carry
baggage until the passenger has paid all applicable charges or has complied with
credit arrangements established by Contractor.  However, when a traveler's MTA
or orders authorized excess baggage, the carrier must issue an excess baggage
charge on the auditors coupon of the commercial ticket or issue an excess
baggage ticket.  In either case AMC will reimburse the carrier for authorized
excess baggage upon receipt of the carrier's claim.  The submitted claim must be
accompanied by a copy of the MTA showing excess baggage authorization and
documentation showing total passengers and total bags moved.  The carrier
representative shall  annotate on the MTA, auditor's coupon or baggage ticket
the number of bags the traveler actually checked in.  The traveler in turn will
validate the number of bags checked in by signing the document.

3.4.6.  Limitation of Liability.  The liability of the Contractor for the loss
        -----------------------
of, or damage to, or delay in the delivery of baggage, shall not exceed $20.99
per kilogram (2.2 pounds) for checked baggage and $400.00 for unchecked baggage
and items of personal property, except in those cases in which excess value
charges have been paid pursuant to paragraphs 3.4.1 through 3.4.5.  For carriage
wholly between points in the United States, the Contractor's liability for
checked or unchecked baggage and items of personal property shall be limited to
an amount equal to the value of such property which shall not exceed $750.00
unless a higher value is declared in advance and additional charges paid,
pursuant to paragraphs 3.4.1 through 3.4.5. above.

                         CIVIL RESERVE AIR FLEET (CRAF)

                                   CHAPTER 1
                                   ---------
                                        
The CRAF program is a national plan (based on The Defense Production Act of 1950
and Executive Order 12656) to utilize airlift resources of US air carriers to
support Department of Defense airlift requirements in a national security
contingency.  The CRAF is composed of US registered aircraft owned or controlled
by the US "air carriers" specifically allocated (by FAA registration number) for
this purpose by the Department of Transportation.  As used in this contract,
CRAF aircraft are those allocated aircraft, which a carrier has contractually
committed to the Department of Defense, under stated CRAF conditions of this
contract.  This contractual commitment of the aircraft includes the supporting
resources required to provide the contract airlift services.  Reference is also
made to Memorandum of Understanding By and Between the Secretary of Defense and
the Secretary of Transportation with Respect to the Civil Reserve Air Fleet
Program, dated January 1988 and Air Mobility Command Regulation (AMCR) 55-8.
The Contractor's obligation to perform services hereunder during any period when
the CRAF is activated, as described in the Contract, is expressly conditioned on
there being in existence a valid determination made pursuant to the provisions
of Public Law 85-804 and Executive Order 10789, as amended, that the national
defense shall be facilitated by obligating the Government to indemnify the
Contractor under the terms and conditions stated in the Contract. Upon
activation of CRAF, the aircraft listed in Attachment 8 of this contract which
are requested by the Government, must be positioned where directed by the
Government, with maximum fuel aboard, consistent with aircraft performance
limitations and mission requirements, as quickly as possible, but in no event
more than 24 or 48 hours (as appropriate) after the Contractor receives the
request from the Government for the aircraft required.  The Government, in
ordering services under the provisions of this contract shall, to the extent
practicable and to the extent that military requirements permit, order services
from all AMC airlift service Contractors on an equitable pro rata basis, giving
consideration to each Contractor's aircraft commitment to the stage of
requirements which has been activated, and giving consideration to the amount of
capacity which each Contractor has already scheduled for fixed and expansion
service under this contract.

identification, organization, and development of a source of civil airlift
capability readily available to augment the Department of Defense (DOD).  The
CRAF may be activated in increments of three stages.  The Government retains the
option of activating any portion of each stage or segment, as required.  During
CRAF activation, AMC has mission control and the carrier retains operational
control.  Any reference to the CRAF cell or XOC implies the office of the
Assistant for Civil Air.

2.2.  COMPOSITION OF THE FLEET.  The CRAF is composed of US-registered civil
      ------------------------                                              
transport aircraft that are suitable and operationally capable of performing DOD
airlift.  The number and type of aircraft are identified to satisfy long range
international, short range international, domestic, aeromedical evacuation, and
Alaskan airlift requirements.  Principal considerations in determining aircraft
suitability are range, payload, block speed, and configuration.

2.3.  USE OF THE FLEET.  Use of the CRAF resources shall be based on military

activate Stage III of the CRAF:

2.20.3.1.1.  In time of war or during a defense-oriented national emergency
declared by the President, or in time of national emergency declared by
Congress.

2.20.3.1.2.  In a national security situation short of a declared defense-
oriented national emergency.

2.20.3.2.  Activation of CRAF Stage III presumes that the Secretary of
Transportation has been authorized to exercise presidential priorities and
allocation authority.

2.20.3.3.  The notice that the total CRAF has been activated shall be
communicated by the AMC CAT CRAF Cell to all CRAF carriers.  Upon activation of
any stage of CRAF, the total capability of all aircraft in that stage may be
used.

2.21.  PRESERVATION OF THE FLEET.
       ------------------------- 

2.21.1.  In the event of a war or a national disaster, it is paramount that our
Nation's airlift resources survive for they shall be used to help reconstruct
our Nation's economy and reconstitute its military forces.

2.21.2.  Since various stages of CRAF may be activated prior to the United
States' entry into an all-out war, all CRAF carriers shall, when directed, take
immediate survival measures to minimize destruction and damage to CRAF aircraft.
Corporate management, equipment, and facilities shall be used as long as they
are tenable.

objective is to schedule CRAF missions effectively.  To this end, the HQ AMC/CAT
will exercise mission management to include such activities as capability
reporting, mission scheduling, flight monitoring, and logistics monitoring.
Mission scheduling shall be accomplished at HQ AMC through direct coordination
with appropriate CRAF carrier's operations center.  This chapter contains
guidance pertaining to the procedures employed to manage the additional workload
created by CRAF activation.

3.2.  MANPOWER AND PERSONNEL.  When requested by the HQ AMC CAT Director, CRAF
      ----------------------                                                  
carriers shall establish a 24-hour/day operations center manned by qualified
personnel and located at the carriers designated operations centers.  Subsequent
to the activation of Stage II and prior to Stage III activation the CRAF
carriers shall, upon the request of the HQ AMC CAT Director, provide
predesignated carrier liaison and communications supervisor personnel to HQ AMC,
Scott AFB IL, and predesignated Numbered Air Forces.  To assure appropriate
liaison representation and to facilitate assimilation of tasks, carriers should

      ----------------------                                                    
any services required, whether specifically providing them or acquiring them
through alternative sources.  Should appropriate support be unavailable, the
Senior Lodger should contact AMC CAT CRAF Cell, either through the CRAF carrier
operations, directly, or by any other expeditious means.

4.6.1.  CIVIL AIRCRAFT SUPPORT.  Senior Lodger services consist of ground
        ----------------------                                           
support for all civil aircraft and crews participating in US military airlift

through the CRAF carrier operations.

4.7.  ACCOUNTING AND FINANCE.
      ---------------------- 

4.7.1.  A Change Order to the Contract shall specify period of obligation and
the limits of payments for services.

4.7.2.  BILLING PROCEDURE FOR PERSONNEL.  A CRAF carrier, other than the Senior
        -------------------------------                                        
Lodger carrier, providing augmenting personnel to a Senior Lodger station, shall
bill the Senior Lodger for the costs incurred.

4.7.3.  CHARGES TO THE GOVERNMENT.  In the event of Senior Lodger activation, HQ
        -------------------------                                               
AMC will forecast the traffic for each Senior Lodger Station for planning
purposes.  Normally, the Senior Lodger operation at a given station should be
self-sustaining, provided the traffic forecasted is generated.  In the event
such traffic is not generated, the Senior Lodger shall charge the excess cost to
the US Government in accordance with the Change Order limitation.

4.7.4.  SERVICES.  Normally, civil carriers shall  pay the Senior Lodger for
        --------                                                            
services required and rendered.  However, AMC may require the Senior Lodger to

SECTION B--FLIGHT OPERATIONS

4.9.  AUTHENTICATORS.
      -------------- 

4.9.1.  Procedures.  Authenticators may be used during CRAF operations.
Normally, the aircraft captain or first officer shall be issued the appropriate
authentication material at a carrier's hub in sufficient quantity to support the
mission to the destination base and return to the CONUS, including possible
delays en route.  Carrier personnel issuing authentication material shall
instruct the aircrews in the proper use of the authenticators.  Aircraft
captains and first officers with proper SECRET security clearances shall be
authorized access to the classified authentication material affecting their
mission.  If updated authentication material is required at a Senior Lodger
station, the Senior Lodger shall assist the flight crew in obtaining the current
material, and shall insure they are instructed in its proper use.  To verify a
crewmember's access to classified material, the following must be checked:

4.9.1.1  Crewmembers' airline identification card with picture.

4.9.1.2  The DD Form 489, Geneva Convention's Identity Card for Civilians who
Accompany the Armed Forces.

4.9.2.  STORAGE and SECURITY.  Senior Lodgers must be prepared to provide
        --------------------                                             
security for classified cryptographic material up to and including SECRET.  To
handle US SECRET cryptographic materials, the handler must have a SECRET
security clearance and, unlike non-cryptographic material, must be a US citizen.

4.9.2.1.  Stateside storage facilities require a facility clearance for
classified storage.  An alternative to storage is "constant vigilance," where
the cryptographic material is kept at all times in the field of view of a US
citizen with a SECRET clearance.  Carriers can identify employees at US Senior
Lodger sites to fulfill this function.

4.9.2.2.  Storage of classified material at overseas Senior Lodger stations is
not authorized.  Therefore, when an aircraft has been delayed, the Senior Lodger
shall assign a minimum of three employees who are US citizens and have SECRET
clearances for constant vigilance of cryptographic material.  Should there be
less than three SECRET- carrier employees at the Senior Lodger site, or should
those at the overseas site be required for other tasks not permitting constant
vigilance, the Senior Lodger carrier should identify a minimum of three
employees who can be spared during a CRAF activation (such as reservations
clerks, etc.) and who are US citizens to receive a US SECRET clearance and
deploy to the overseas site.  If the Senior Lodger carrier is unable to supply
the needed personnel, the Senior Lodger shall contact the HQ AMC CAT for
assistance.

4.9.2.3.  If delays are incurred at locations other than military installations
or Senior Lodger stations, the aircraft captain shall insure the security of the
authentication materials

4.9.3.  Disposition of Authenticator:

4.9.3.1.  The transfer of authentication material between aircrews at staging
points shall be accomplished by the use of the Standard Form (SF) 153 or Comsec
Material Report comparable receipt form.

                                 Page 13 of 47
 
<PAGE>
 
4.9.3.2.  When no longer needed, authentication materials must be promptly
returned to any AMC Operations Center/Command Post or USAF Base Operations.
Retain the SF 153 or other receipt for 2 years.

4.9.3.3.  In an emergency, burn or finely shred the authenticators, widely
scatter the remains, and complete the destruction portion of the SF 153.
Provide a copy of this form to the issuing US Government agency/facility, and
retain one copy for 2 years.

                                   ---------

                               FLIGHT OPERATIONS

SECTION A--CONCEPT

5.1.  GENERAL.  CRAF flight operations shall be conducted in accordance with all
      -------                                                                   
applicable Federal Aviation Regulations (FARs) and all other applicable
governing directives.

5.2.  OPERATIONS.  There are many identified CRAF missions which support DOD
      ----------                                                            
airlift requirements during airlift or national emergencies.  Primarily, these
are overseas deployment and resupply missions.  The airlift capability in
support of these missions is based on a daily aircraft utilization rate of 10
hours.

5.2.1  LONG-RANGE INTERNATIONAL AND SHORT-RANGE INTERNATIONAL.  The Long-range
       -------------------------------------------------------                
International segment satisfies requirements that exceed the capability of AMC's
organic long-range aircraft.  The Short-range segment satisfies medium-range
offshore airlift requirements such as the Pacific inter-island complex, Western
Pacific, and from the CONUS to such places as Alaska, Greenland, Panama, and
Puerto Rico.  AMC applies a 10-hour a day utilization rate to these two segments
for contingency planning.  To arrive at a productive aircraft utilization rate,
the following known factors apply:

5.2.1.1  Aircraft ferry, position, and deposition time computed at .6 hours a
day.

5.2.1.2  DOD contingency plans identify wartime deployment airlift requirements;
therefore, productive utilization is one-half of the remaining 9.4 hours a day.
This equates to 4.7 hour a day.

5.2.2  AEROMEDICAL.  Boeing B767 aircraft shall be configured to carry litter
       ------------                                                          
and ambulatory patients and provide all necessary electrical and oxygen systems
necessary for patient support.  B767 aircraft are to be utilized in a strategic
role to augment existing military cargo aircraft such as the C141.  The
utilization rate for planning is 10 hours per aircraft per day.

5.3.  CRAF OPERATIONS AUTHORITY.  CRAF operations shall be conducted in
      -------------------------                                        
accordance with procedures outlined in AMCR 55-8; AMCR 76-8; AMCR 76-1, Volume
I; and terms of the current AMC Airlift Services contract.  Any situation or
subject not covered herein shall be resolved by the HQ AMC CAT-D or the
contracting officer.

5.4.  FEDERAL AVIATION REGULATIONS (FARs).  The basic policy is that CRAF shall
      -----------------------------------                                      
operate under FARs with waivers as necessary.

5.5.  ALLOCATION OF THE FLEET.  Aircraft are allocated to the CRAF by the
      -----------------------                                            
Department of Transportation (DOT)/Officer of Emergency Transportation (OET),
under the authority of Defense Production Act of 1950, as amended (50 USC App.
2061, et seg.).  This allocation is based upon such factors as Department of
Defense (DOD)-approved airlift requirements and suitability of civil aircraft.

5.6.  PASSENGER AIRCRAFT.  These aircraft, allocated against long range
      ------------------                                               
international airlift, shall arrive at on-load site prepared to receive
passengers/troops.

5.7.  CARGO AIRCRAFT.  Cargo aircraft allocated against long range international
      --------------                                                            
airlift requirements shall arrive at on-load site prepared to receive cargo
loaded on military 463L pallets.

5.8.  CONVERTIBLE AIRCRAFT.  Convertible aircraft shall be configured by the
      --------------------                                                  
carriers for cargo missions unless otherwise specified by the AMC CAT CRAF Cell.

             SUBSCRIPTION AND PREFERRED STOCK PURCHASE AGREEMENT


SUBSCRIPTION AND PREFERRED STOCK PURCHASE AGREEMENT (this "Agreement") made as
of the date set forth on the signature page hereof between US Order, Inc., a
Delaware corporation with its principal offices at 13873 Park Center Road, Suite
230, Herndon, Virginia 22071 (the "Company") and the undersigned (the
"Subscriber").


                              W I T N E S S E T H:
                              - - - - - - - - - - 

          WHEREAS, the Company desires to issue an aggregate of up to three
million (3,000,000) shares (the "Shares") of Series C Preferred Stock (the
"Series C Preferred Stock"), par value $.001 per share, of the Company in a
private placement offering (the "Offering"), which shares of Series C Preferred
Stock are convertible into shares of the Company's common stock, $.001 par value
per share (the "Common Stock"), on the terms and conditions hereinafter set
forth, and the Subscriber desires to acquire that number of Shares set forth on
the signature page hereof (the Series C Preferred Stock and the Common Stock
issuable upon conversion thereof being sometimes referred to collectively herein
as the "Securities");

          NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the premises and the mutual
representations and covenants hereinafter set forth, the parties hereto do
hereby agree as follows:


1.   Subscription for Shares and Representations by Subscriber

          a.  Subject to the terms and conditions hereinafter set forth, the
Subscriber hereby subscribes for and agrees to purchase from the Company and the
Company agrees to sell to the Subscriber 841,515 Shares, which constitute not
less than six percent (6%) of the fully diluted common equity and convertible
preferred equity of the Company (excluding unvested employee stock options) as
of the date of closing, for $3,500,000 cash and for other mutually agreeable
valuable consideration, as set forth in the contract, a copy of which is
attached hereto and incorporated herein by reference as Attachment "A".  The
rights and preferences of the Series C Preferred Stock are set forth in the
Certificate of Designation included in the Company's Amended and Restated
Certificate of Incorporation available upon request from the Company.  The cash
portion of the purchase price is payable by bank check made payable to "US
Order-Escrow Account" or wire transfer of immediately available funds
contemporaneously with the execution and delivery of this Agreement.

          b. The Subscriber hereby acknowledges (i) receipt of the Company's
Confidential Private Placement Memorandum dated July 15, 1993 (the
"Confidential Memorandum"), the Supplement to the Confidential Private
Placement Memorandum dated July 22, 1993 (the "Supplement"), the Second
Supplement to the Confidential Private Placement Memorandum dated July 29,
1993 (the "Second Supplement"), the Third Supplement to the Confidential
Private Placement Memorandum dated October 22, 1993 (the 
<PAGE>
 
"Third Supplement"), and the Fourth Supplement to the Confidential Private
Placement Memorandum dated December 10, 1993, (the "Fourth Supplement"), and
(ii) that the Subscriber has carefully reviewed the Confidential Memorandum
and the Supplements thereto. The Subscriber hereby acknowledges that the
purchase of Shares involves a high degree of risk in that (i) an investment in
the Company is highly speculative, and only investors who can afford the loss
of their entire investment should consider investing in the Company and the
Shares; (ii) the Subscriber may not be able to liquidate his investment; (iii)
transferability of the Securities is extremely limited; and (iv) the
Subscriber could sustain the loss of his entire investment.

          c.  The Subscriber hereby acknowledges that he must be a qualified
investor, as described herein, in order to qualify for the purchase of Shares,
and that he must be able to bear the economic risk of an investment in the
Shares.

          d.  The Subscriber hereby represents that he is an "accredited
investor" as such term is defined in Rule 501 of Regulation D promulgated under
the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the "Act"), as indicated by his
responses to the questions contained in Section 6 hereof, and that he is able to
bear the economic risk of an investment in the Shares.

          e.  The Subscriber hereby represents that he has prior investment
experience, including investment in non-listed and non-registered securities, or
he has employed the services of an investment advisor, attorney and/or
accountant to read all of the documents furnished or made available by the
Company both to him and to all other prospective investors in the Shares and to
evaluate the merits and risks of such an investment on his behalf and that he is
able to bear the economic risk he hereby assumes.

          f.  The Subscriber hereby represents that he has been furnished by the
Company during the course of this transaction with all information regarding the
Company which he has requested or desired to know; that he has been afforded the
opportunity to ask questions of and receive answers from duly authorized
officers or other representatives of the Company concerning the terms and
conditions of the Offering, and any additional information which he had
requested.

          g.  The Subscriber hereby acknowledges that the Securities have not
been registered under the Act or any state securities or "blue sky" laws and
that the Offering of Shares has not been reviewed by the United States
Securities and Exchange Commission (the "Commission") or any state regulatory
authority, since the Offering is intended to be exempt from the registration
requirements of Section 5 of the Act pursuant to Section 4(2) of the Act and
pursuant to similar exemptions from registration provided by certain state
securities laws.  The Subscriber hereby represents that he is purchasing the
Shares for his own account, for investment and not with a view to the resale or
distribution of the Series C Preferred Stock or the underlying Common Stock.
The Subscriber agrees that he will not sell or otherwise transfer the
Securities unless they are registered under the Act or unless an exemption
from such registration is available.

                                      2
<PAGE>
 
          h. The Subscriber understands that there is no market for the
Securities and that no market is expected to develop for the Securities. The
Subscriber understands that even if a public market develops for the Common
Stock issuable upon conversion of the Series C Preferred Stock, Rule 144 (the
"Rule") promulgated under the Act requires, among other conditions, a two year
holding period prior to the resale (in limited amounts) of securities acquired
in a non-public offering without having to satisfy the registration
requirements under the Act. The Subscriber understands that the Company is not
obligated to comply with any reporting requirements under the Securities
Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, and that the Company makes no representation
or warranty that it will disseminate to the public any current financial or
other information concerning the Company, as is required by the Rule as one of
the conditions of its availability. The Subscriber understands and hereby
acknowledges that the Company is under no obligation to register the Series C
Preferred Stock under the Act or any state securities or "blue sky" laws. The
Subscriber consents that the Company may, if it desires, permit the transfer
of the Securities, subject to the provisions set forth in Section 6, out of
his name only when his request for transfer is accompanied by an opinion of
counsel reasonably satisfactory to the Company that neither the sale nor the
proposed transfer results in a violation of the Act or any applicable state
securities or "blue sky" laws. The Subscriber agrees to hold the Company and
its directors, officers and controlling persons and their respective heirs,
representatives, successors and assigns harmless and to indemnify them against
all liabilities, costs and expenses incurred by them as a result of any
misrepresentation made by him contained herein or in the Confidential Investor
Questionnaire as set forth in Section 6 hereof or any sale or distribution by
the undersigned Subscriber in violation of the Act or any applicable state
securities or "blue sky" laws.

          i.  The Subscriber consents to the placement of a legend on any
certificate or other document evidencing the Series C Preferred Stock or the
Common Stock, stating that such Securities have not been registered under the
Act or any state securities or "blue sky" laws and setting forth or referring to
the restrictions on transferability and sale thereof. The Subscriber is aware
that the Company will make a notation in its appropriate records with respect to
the restrictions on the transferability of such Securities.

          j.  The Subscriber understands that the Company will review this
Agreement and is hereby given authority by the undersigned to call his bank or
place of employment or otherwise review the financial standing of the
Subscriber; and it is further agreed that the Company reserves the unrestricted
right to reject subscriptions in whole or in part and to close the Offer to the
Subscriber at any time.

          k. The Subscriber hereby represents that the address of the
Subscriber furnished by him on the signature page hereof is the undersigned's
principal residence if he is an individual or its principal business address
if it is a corporation or other entity.
 
                                      3
<PAGE>
 
          l.  The Subscriber hereby represents that his total investment in the
Shares does not represent more than five percent (5%) of his net worth and that
his overall commitment to investments which are not readily marketable is
reasonable in relation to his net worth.

          m.  The Subscriber hereby represents that he is willing and able to
bear the economic risk of this investment, has no need for liquidity of this
investment and is able to sustain a complete loss of the investment.

          n.  The Subscriber understands the significance to the Company of its
representations, including those in Section 8, and they are made with the
intention that the Company will rely on them.


2.   Representations by the Company

          The Company represents and warrants to the Subscriber that on the date

          g.  The Company shall provide each holder of at least 5% of the
original issuance of Series C Preferred Stock (or that number of shares of
Common Stock into which all or part of such percentage of the original issuance
of Series C Preferred Stock is converted) with unaudited quarterly financial
statements within 60 days of the end of each quarter, audited annual financial
statements within 90 days of the end of each fiscal year and such other
financial information as such holders of Series C Preferred Stock may reasonably
request from time to time.  The right to receive such financial information
pursuant to this Agreement shall not be assignable by the Subscriber without the
prior written consent of the Company and shall terminate upon the sale by the
Company of Common Stock or any class or series of securities convertible into
Common Stock in an initial public offering.


3.   Terms of Subscription

          a.   The subscription period will terminate at 11:59 p.m., Washington,
D.C. time, on December 15, 1993, unless extended by the Company at its
discretion for an additional period not to exceed 90 days (the "Termination
Date").

          b.   The minimum subscription per Subscriber shall be for $1,000,000
of the Series C Preferred Stock, subject to the Company's right to accept or
reject subscriptions in whole or in part.

          c.   A closing will take place if the Company receives subscriptions
for purchases aggregating at least $12,000,000 of Shares on or prior to the
Termination Date, which condition may not be waived by the Company without the
written consent of the Subscriber.  The Company may hold one or more closings on
any additional subscriptions it may receive.  The certificates representing the
Series C Preferred Stock will delivered by the Company within ten (10) days
following the Termination Date.

4.   Incidental Registration.  If the Company at any time proposes to register
any of its common Stock under the Act, for its own account or for the account of
any other person or entity (other than any registration of an offering solely to
employees of the Company or its subsidiaries), it shall promptly give written
notice to Subscriber of its intention to do so, and the Company shall include in
such registration, subject to Section 5 hereof, all Shares that Subscriber shall
specify in a written notice delivered to the Company within 20 days after its
receipt of the Company's notice of the proposed filing of the registration
statement, provided that the Company shall not be required to include in such
registration any Shares that Subscriber shall so specify if, in the
unqualified opinion of counsel to the Company reasonably acceptable to the
Subscriber so specifying, registration under the Act is not required for the
transfer of such Shares in the manner requested by Subscriber or that a post-
effective amendment to an existing registration statement would be legally
sufficient for such a transfer and the Company shall have obtained such a post-
effective amendment.

                                      5
<PAGE>
 
5.   Exclusion.  If the proposed or required registration is to be underwritten
(whether on a "best efforts" or a "firm commitment" basis), the managing
underwriter shall have the right to exclude all or any part of Subscriber's
Shares if the underwriter advises the Company in writing that it reasonably
believes that such securities should be withdrawn therefrom.  Any exclusion of
Shares shall be made pro rata among Subscriber and all other persons and/or
entities participating in the registration in proportion to the respective
number of Shares or other securities for which Subscriber and each such other
person or entity have requested registration.

6.   Miscellaneous

          a.  Any notice or other communication given hereunder shall be deemed

the parties hereto and to their respective heirs, legal representatives,
successors and assigns. This Agreement sets forth the entire agreement and
understanding between the parties as to the subject matter thereof and merges

          f.  In order to discourage frivolous claims, the parties agree that
unless a claimant in any proceeding succeeds in establishing his claim and
recovering a judgment against another party (regardless of whether such claimant
succeeds against one of the other parties to the action), then 

                                      6
<PAGE>
 
the other party shall be entitled to recover from such claimant all of
its/their legal costs and expenses relating to such proceeding and/or incurred
in preparation therefor.

          g.  The holding of any provision of this Agreement to be invalid or
unenforceable by a court of competent jurisdiction shall not affect any other
provision of this Agreement, which shall remain in full force and effect.

          h.  It is agreed that a waiver by either party of a breach of any
provision of this Agreement shall not operate, or be construed, as a waiver of
any subsequent breach by that same party.

          i.  The parties agree to execute and deliver all such further
documents, agreements and instruments and take such other and further action as
may be necessary or appropriate to carry out the purposes and intent of this
Agreement.

          j.  This Agreement may be executed in one or more counterparts each of
which shall be deemed an original, but all of which shall together constitute
one and the same instrument.

             SUBSCRIPTION AND PREFERRED STOCK PURCHASE AGREEMENT


SUBSCRIPTION AND PREFERRED STOCK PURCHASE AGREEMENT (this "Agreement") made as
of the date set forth on the signature page hereof between US Order, Inc., a
Delaware corporation with its principal offices at 13873 Park Center Road, Suite
230, Herndon, Virginia 22071 (the "Company") and the undersigned (the
"Subscriber").


                            W I T N E S S E T H:
                            - - - - - - - - - - 

          WHEREAS, the Company desires to issue an aggregate of up to three
million (3,000,000) shares (the "Shares") of Series C Preferred Stock (the
"Series C Preferred Stock"), par value $.001 per share, of the Company in a
private placement offering (the "Offering"), which shares of Series C Preferred
Stock are convertible into shares of the Company's common stock, $.001 par value
per share (the "Common Stock"), on the terms and conditions hereinafter set
forth, and the Subscriber desires to acquire that number of Shares set forth on
the signature page hereof (the Series C Preferred Stock and the Common Stock
issuable upon conversion thereof being sometimes referred to collectively herein
as the "Securities");

          NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the premises and the mutual
representations and covenants hereinafter set forth, the parties hereto do
hereby agree as follows:


1.   Subscription for Shares and Representations by Subscriber

          a.  Subject to the terms and conditions hereinafter set forth, the
Subscriber hereby subscribes for and agrees to purchase from the Company and the
Company agrees to sell to the Subscriber 236,083 Shares for $1,683,272 cash.
The rights and preferences of the Series C Preferred Stock are set forth in the
Certificate of Designation included in the Company's Amended and Restated
Certificate of Incorporation available upon request from the Company and in the
Registration Rights Agreement of even date herewith.  The purchase price is
payable by bank check made payable to "US Order-Escrow Account" or wire transfer
of immediately available funds contemporaneously with the execution and delivery
of this Agreement.

          b.  The Subscriber hereby acknowledges (i) receipt of the Company's
Confidential Private Placement Memorandum dated July 15, 1993 (the "Confidential
Memorandum"), the Supplement to the Confidential Private Placement Memorandum
dated July 22, 1993 (the "Supplement"), the Second Supplement to the
Confidential Private Placement Memorandum dated July 29, 1993 (the "Second
Supplement"), the Third Supplement to the Confidential Private Placement
Memorandum dated October 22, 1993 (the "Third Supplement"), and the Fourth
Supplement to the Confidential Private Placement Memorandum dated December 10,
1993, (the "Fourth Supplement"), and (ii) that the Subscriber has carefully
reviewed the Confidential Memorandum and the Supplements thereto.
<PAGE>
 
The Subscriber hereby acknowledges that the purchase of Shares involves a high
degree of risk in that (i) an investment in the Company is highly speculative,
and only investors who can afford the loss of their entire investment should
consider investing in the Company and the Shares; (ii) the Subscriber may not be
able to liquidate his investment; (iii) transferability of the Securities is
extremely limited; and (iv) the Subscriber could sustain the loss of his entire
investment.

          c.  The Subscriber hereby acknowledges that he must be a qualified
investor, as described herein, in order to qualify for the purchase of Shares,
and that he must be able to bear the economic risk of an investment in the
Shares.

          d.  The Subscriber hereby represents that he is an "accredited
investor" as such term is defined in Rule 501 of Regulation D promulgated under
the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the "Act"), as indicated by his
responses to the questions contained in Section 6 hereof, and that he is able to
bear the economic risk of an investment in the Shares.

          e.  The Subscriber hereby represents that he has prior investment
experience, including investment in non-listed and non-registered securities, or
he has employed the services of an investment advisor, attorney and/or
accountant to read all of the documents furnished or made available by the
Company both to him and to all other prospective investors in the Shares and to
evaluate the merits and risks of such an investment on his behalf and that he is
able to bear the economic risk he hereby assumes.

          f.  The Subscriber hereby represents that he has been furnished by the
Company during the course of this transaction with all information regarding the
Company which he has requested or desired to know; that he has been afforded the
opportunity to ask questions of and receive answers from duly authorized
officers or other representatives of the Company concerning the terms and
conditions of the Offering, and any additional information which he had
requested.

          g.  The Subscriber hereby acknowledges that the Securities have not
been registered under the Act or any state securities or "blue sky" laws and
that the Offering of Shares has not been reviewed by the United States
Securities and Exchange Commission (the "Commission") or any state regulatory
authority, since the Offering is intended to be exempt from the registration
requirements of Section 5 of the Act pursuant to Section 4(2) of the Act and
pursuant to similar exemptions from registration provided by certain state
securities laws.  The Subscriber hereby represents that he is purchasing the
Shares for his own account, for investment and not with a view to the resale or
distribution of the Series C Preferred Stock or the underlying Common Stock.
The Subscriber agrees that he will not sell or otherwise transfer the Securities
unless they are registered under the Act or unless an exemption from such
registration is available.

                                      2
<PAGE>
 
          h. The Subscriber understands that there is no market for the
Securities and that no market is expected to develop for the Securities. The
Subscriber understands that even if a public market develops for the Common
Stock issuable upon conversion of the Series C Preferred Stock, Rule 144 (the
"Rule") promulgated under the Act requires, among other conditions, a two year
holding period prior to the resale (in limited amounts) of securities acquired
in a non-public offering without having to satisfy the registration
requirements under the Act. The Subscriber understands that the Company is not
obligated to comply with any reporting requirements under the Securities
Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, and that the Company makes no representation
or warranty that it will disseminate to the public any current financial or
other information concerning the Company, as is required by the Rule as one of
the conditions of its availability. The Subscriber understands and hereby
acknowledges that the Company is under no obligation to register the Series C
Preferred Stock under the Act or any state securities or "blue sky" laws. The
Subscriber consents that the Company may, if it desires, permit the transfer
of the Securities, subject to the provisions set forth in Section 6, out of
his name only when his request for transfer is accompanied by an opinion of
counsel reasonably satisfactory to the Company that neither the sale nor the
proposed transfer results in a violation of the Act or any applicable state
securities or "blue sky" laws. The Subscriber agrees to hold the Company and
its directors, officers and controlling persons and their respective heirs,
representatives, successors and assigns harmless and to indemnify them against
all liabilities, costs and expenses incurred by them as a result of any
misrepresentation made by him contained herein or in the Confidential Investor
Questionnaire as set forth in Section 6 hereof or any sale or distribution by
the undersigned Subscriber in violation of the Act or any applicable state
securities or "blue sky" laws.

          i.  The Subscriber consents to the placement of a legend on any
certificate or other document evidencing the Series C Preferred Stock or the
Common Stock, stating that such Securities have not been registered under the
Act or any state securities or "blue sky" laws and setting forth or referring to
the restrictions on transferability and sale thereof. The Subscriber is aware

          m.  The Subscriber hereby represents that he is willing and able to

          The Company represents and warrants to the Subscriber that on the date

and will have the corporate power to conduct the business which it now conducts;

          b.  The execution, delivery and performance of this Agreement by the
Company will have been duly approved by the Board of Directors of the Company
and all other actions required to authorize and effect the offer and sale of the
Series C Preferred Stock will have been duly taken and approved;

          c.  The Shares will have been duly and validly authorized and when
issued and paid for in accordance with the terms hereof, will be duly and
validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable;

          d.  The Company will, at all times that the Shares are outstanding,
have authorized and reserved a sufficient number of shares of Common Stock to
provide for conversion of the Shares;

          e.  The shares of Common Stock issuable upon conversion of the Series
C Preferred Stock, when issued and paid for in accordance with the terms of the
Series C Preferred Stock, will be duly and validly issued, fully paid and
nonassessable;

          f.  The Company will not be in any material respect in violation of or
in default in any material respect under, nor will the execution and delivery of
this Agreement, or the issuance of the Series C Preferred Stock and the
incurrence of the obligations herein set forth and the consummation of the
transactions herein contemplated, result in a material violation of, or
constitute a material default under, the Amended and Restated Certificate of
Incorporation or the By-laws of the Company; and

                                      4
<PAGE>
 
          g.  The Company shall provide each holder of at least 5% of the
original issuance of Series C Preferred Stock (or that number of shares of
Common Stock into which all or part of such percentage of the original issuance
of Series C Preferred Stock is converted) with unaudited quarterly financial
statements within 60 days of the end of each quarter, audited annual financial
statements within 90 days of the end of each fiscal year and such other
financial information as such holders of Series C Preferred Stock may reasonably
request from time to time.  The right to receive such financial information
pursuant to this Agreement shall not be assignable by the Subscriber without the
prior written consent of the Company and shall terminate upon the sale by the
Company of Common Stock or any class or series of securities convertible into
Common Stock in an initial public offering.


3.   Terms of Subscription

          a.   The subscription period will terminate at 11:59 p.m., Washington,
D.C. time, on December 15, 1993, unless extended by the Company at its
discretion for an additional period not to exceed 90 days (the "Termination
Date").

          b.   The minimum subscription per Subscriber shall be for $1,000,000
of the Series C Preferred Stock, subject to the Company's right to accept or
reject subscriptions in whole or in part.

          c.   A closing will take place if the Company receives subscriptions
for purchases aggregating at least $12,000,000 of Shares on or prior to the
Termination Date, which condition may not be waived by the Company without the
written consent of the Subscriber.  The Company may hold one or more closings on
any additional subscriptions it may receive.  The certificates representing the
Series C Preferred Stock will delivered by the Company within ten (10) days
following the Termination Date.

4.   Incidental Registration.  If the Company at any time proposes to register
any of its common Stock under the Act, for its own account or for the account of
any other person or entity (other than any registration of an offering solely to
employees of the Company or its subsidiaries), it shall promptly give written
notice to Subscriber of its intention to do so, and the Company shall include in
such registration, subject to Section 5 hereof, all Shares that Subscriber shall
specify in a written notice delivered to the Company within 20 days after its
receipt of the Company's notice of the proposed filing of the registration
statement, provided that the Company shall not be required to include in such
registration any Shares that Subscriber shall so specify if, in the unqualified
opinion of counsel to the Company reasonably acceptable to the Subscriber so
specifying, registration under the Act is not required for the transfer of such
Shares in the manner requested by Subscriber or that a post-effective amendment
to an existing registration statement would be legally sufficient for such a
transfer and the Company shall have obtained such a post-effective amendment.

5.   Exclusion.  If the proposed or required registration is to be underwritten
(whether on a

                                      5
<PAGE>
 
"best efforts" or a "firm commitment" basis), the managing underwriter shall
have the right to exclude all or any part of Subscriber's Shares if the
underwriter advises the Company in writing that it reasonably believes that such
securities should be withdrawn therefrom.  Any exclusion of Shares shall be made
pro rata among Subscriber and all other persons and/or entities participating in
the registration in proportion to the respective number of Shares or other
securities for which Subscriber and each such other person or entity have
requested registration.

6.   Miscellaneous

sufficient if in writing and sent by registered or certified mail, return
receipt requested, or delivered by hand against written receipt therefor,

understanding between the parties as to the subject matter thereof and merges
and supersedes all prior discussions, agreements and understandings of any and

succeeds against one of the other parties to the action), then the other party
shall be entitled to recover from such claimant all of its/their legal costs and

                                      6
<PAGE>
 
expenses relating to such proceeding and/or incurred in preparation therefor.

          g.  The holding of any provision of this Agreement to be invalid or
unenforceable by a court of competent jurisdiction shall not affect any other
provision of this Agreement, which shall remain in full force and effect.

          h.  It is agreed that a waiver by either party of a breach of any
provision of this Agreement shall not operate, or be construed, as a waiver of
any subsequent breach by that same party.

          i.  The parties agree to execute and deliver all such further
documents, agreements and instruments and take such other and further action as
may be necessary or appropriate to carry out the purposes and intent of this
Agreement.

          j.  This Agreement may be executed in one or more counterparts each of

of the date set forth on the signature page hereof between US Order, Inc., a
Delaware corporation with its principal offices at 13873 Park Center Road, Suite

"Subscriber").


                              W I T N E S S E T H:
                              - - - - - - - - - - 

          WHEREAS, the Company desires to issue an aggregate of up to three
million (3,000,000) shares (the "Shares") of Series C Preferred Stock (the
"Series C Preferred Stock"), par value $.001 per share, of the Company in a
private placement offering (the "Offering"), which shares of Series C Preferred
Stock are convertible into shares of the Company's common stock, $.001 par value
per share (the "Common Stock"), on the terms and conditions hereinafter set
forth, and the Subscriber desires to acquire that number of Shares set forth on
the signature page hereof (the Series C Preferred Stock and the Common Stock
issuable upon conversion thereof being sometimes referred to collectively herein
as the "Securities");

          NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the premises and the mutual
representations and covenants hereinafter set forth, the parties hereto do
hereby agree as follows:

1.   Subscription for Shares and Representations by Subscriber

          a.  Subject to the terms and conditions hereinafter set forth, the
Subscriber hereby subscribes for and agrees to purchase from the Company and the
Company agrees to sell to the Subscriber 28,051 Shares of Series C Preferred
Stock for cancellation of the Promissory Note dated November 12, 1993, in the
amount of $200,000, the cancelled original of which is attached hereto and
incorporated herein by reference as Attachment "A".  The rights and preferences
of the Series C Preferred Stock are set forth in the Certificate of Designation
included in the Company's Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation
available upon request from the Company.

          b.  The Subscriber hereby acknowledges (i) receipt of the Company's
Confidential Private Placement Memorandum dated July 15, 1993 (the "Confidential
Memorandum"), the Supplement to the Confidential Private Placement Memorandum
dated July 22, 1993 (the "Supplement"), the Second Supplement to the
Confidential Private Placement Memorandum dated July 29, 1993 (the "Second
Supplement"), the Third Supplement to the Confidential Private Placement
Memorandum dated October 22, 1993 (the "Third Supplement"), and the Fourth
Supplement to the Confidential Private Placement Memorandum dated December 10,
1993, (the "Fourth Supplement"), and (ii) that the Subscriber has carefully
reviewed the Confidential Memorandum and the Supplements thereto.  The
Subscriber hereby acknowledges that the purchase of Shares involves a high
degree of risk in that (i) an investment in the Company is highly speculative,
and only investors who 
<PAGE>
 
can afford the loss of their entire investment should consider investing in
the Company and the Shares; (ii) the Subscriber may not be able to liquidate
his investment; (iii) transferability of the Securities is extremely limited;
and (iv) the Subscriber could sustain the loss of his entire investment.

          c.  The Subscriber hereby acknowledges that he must be a qualified
investor, as described herein, in order to qualify for the purchase of Shares,
and that he must be able to bear the economic risk of an investment in the
Shares.

          d.  The Subscriber hereby represents that he is an "accredited
investor" as such term is defined in Rule 501 of Regulation D promulgated under
the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the "Act"), as indicated by his
responses to the questions contained in Section 6 hereof, and that he is able to
bear the economic risk of an investment in the Shares.

          e.  The Subscriber hereby represents that he has prior investment
experience, including investment in non-listed and non-registered securities, or
he has employed the services of an investment advisor, attorney and/or
accountant to read all of the documents furnished or made available by the
Company both to him and to all other prospective investors in the Shares and to
evaluate the merits and risks of such an investment on his behalf and that he is
able to bear the economic risk he hereby assumes.

          f.  The Subscriber hereby represents that he has been furnished by the
Company during the course of this transaction with all information regarding the
Company which he has requested or desired to know; that he has been afforded the
opportunity to ask questions of and receive answers from duly authorized
officers or other representatives of the Company concerning the terms and
conditions of the Offering, and any additional information which he had
requested.

          g.  The Subscriber hereby acknowledges that the Securities have not
been registered under the Act or any state securities or "blue sky" laws and
that the Offering of Shares has not been reviewed by the United States
Securities and Exchange Commission (the "Commission") or any state regulatory
authority, since the Offering is intended to be exempt from the registration
requirements of Section 5 of the Act pursuant to Section 4(2) of the Act and
pursuant to similar exemptions from registration provided by certain state
securities laws.  The Subscriber hereby represents that he is purchasing the
Shares for his own account, for investment and not with a view to the resale or
distribution of the Series C Preferred Stock or the underlying Common Stock.
The Subscriber agrees that he will not sell or otherwise transfer the Securities
unless they are registered under the Act or unless an exemption from such
registration is available.

          h.  The Subscriber understands that there is no market for the
Securities and that no market is expected to develop for the Securities. The
Subscriber understands that even if a public market develops for the Common
Stock issuable upon conversion of the Series C Preferred Stock, Rule 144 (the
"Rule") promulgated under the Act requires, among other

                                      2
<PAGE>
 
conditions, a two year holding period prior to the resale (in limited amounts)
of securities acquired in a non-public offering without having to satisfy the
registration requirements under the Act. The Subscriber understands that the
Company is not obligated to comply with any reporting requirements under the
Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, and that the Company makes no
representation or warranty that it will disseminate to the public any current
financial or other information concerning the Company, as is required by the
Rule as one of the conditions of its availability. The Subscriber understands
and hereby acknowledges that the Company is under no obligation to register
the Series C Preferred Stock under the Act or any state securities or "blue
sky" laws. The Subscriber consents that the Company may, if it desires, permit
the transfer of the Securities, subject to the provisions set forth in Section
6, out of his name only when his request for transfer is accompanied by an
opinion of counsel reasonably satisfactory to the Company that neither the
sale nor the proposed transfer results in a violation of the Act or any
applicable state securities or "blue sky" laws. The Subscriber agrees to hold
the Company and its directors, officers and controlling persons and their
respective heirs, representatives, successors and assigns harmless and to
indemnify them against all liabilities, costs and expenses incurred by them as
a result of any misrepresentation made by him contained herein or in the
Confidential Investor Questionnaire as set forth in Section 6 hereof or any
sale or distribution by the undersigned Subscriber in violation of the Act or
any applicable state securities or "blue sky" laws.

          i.  The Subscriber consents to the placement of a legend on any
certificate or other document evidencing the Series C Preferred Stock or the
Common Stock, stating that such Securities have not been registered under the
Act or any state securities or "blue sky" laws and setting forth or referring to
the restrictions on transferability and sale thereof. The Subscriber is aware
that the Company will make a notation in its appropriate records with respect to
the restrictions on the transferability of such Securities.

          j.  The Subscriber understands that the Company will review this
Agreement and is hereby given authority by the undersigned to call his bank or
place of employment or otherwise review the financial standing of the
Subscriber; and it is further agreed that the Company reserves the unrestricted
right to reject subscriptions in whole or in part and to close the Offer to the
Subscriber at any time.

          k.  The Subscriber hereby represents that the address of the
Subscriber furnished by him on the signature page hereof is the undersigned's
principal residence if he is an individual or its principal business address if
it is a corporation or other entity.

          l.  The Subscriber hereby represents that his total investment in the
Shares does not represent more than five percent (5%) of his net worth and that
his overall commitment to investments which are not readily marketable is
reasonable in relation to his net worth.

          m.  The Subscriber hereby represents that he is willing and able to
bear the economic risk of this investment, has no need for liquidity of this
investment and is able to sustain a complete loss of the investment.

                                      3
<PAGE>
 
          n.  The Subscriber understands the significance to the Company of its
representations, including those in Section 8, and they are made with the
intention that the Company will rely on them.


2.   Representations by the Company

          The Company represents and warrants to the Subscriber that on the date
of consummation of the Offering:

          a.  The Company is and will be a corporation duly organized, validly
existing and in good standing under the laws of the State of Delaware and has
and will have the corporate power to conduct the business which it now conducts;

          b.  The execution, delivery and performance of this Agreement by the
Company will have been duly approved by the Board of Directors of the Company
and all other actions required to authorize and effect the offer and sale of the
Series C Preferred Stock will have been duly taken and approved;

          c.  The Shares will have been duly and validly authorized and when
issued and paid for in accordance with the terms hereof, will be duly and
validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable;

          d.  The Company will, at all times that the Shares are outstanding,
have authorized and reserved a sufficient number of shares of Common Stock to
provide for conversion of the Shares;

          e.  The shares of Common Stock issuable upon conversion of the Series
C Preferred Stock, when issued and paid for in accordance with the terms of the
Series C Preferred Stock, will be duly and validly issued, fully paid and
nonassessable;

          f.  The Company will not be in any material respect in violation of or
in default in any material respect under, nor will the execution and delivery of
this Agreement, or the issuance of the Series C Preferred Stock and the
incurrence of the obligations herein set forth and the consummation of the
transactions herein contemplated, result in a material violation of, or
constitute a material default under, the Amended and Restated Certificate of
Incorporation or the By-laws of the Company; and

          g.  The Company shall provide each holder of at least 5% of the
original issuance of Series C Preferred Stock (or that number of shares of
Common Stock into which all or part of such percentage of the original
issuance of Series C Preferred Stock is converted) with unaudited quarterly
financial statements within 60 days of the end of each quarter, audited annual
financial statements within 90 days of the end of each fiscal year and such
other financial information as such holders of Series C Preferred Stock may
reasonably

                                      4
<PAGE>
 
request from time to time.  The right to receive such financial information
pursuant to this Agreement shall not be assignable by the Subscriber without the
prior written consent of the Company and shall terminate upon the sale by the
Company of Common Stock or any class or series of securities convertible into
Common Stock in an initial public offering.


3.   Terms of Subscription

          a.   The subscription period will terminate at 11:59 p.m., Washington,
D.C. time, on December 15, 1993, unless extended by the Company at its
discretion for an additional period not to exceed 90 days (the "Termination
Date").

          b.   The minimum subscription per Subscriber shall be for $1,000,000
of the Series C Preferred Stock, subject to the Company's right to accept or
reject subscriptions in whole or in part.

          c.   A closing will take place if the Company receives subscriptions
for purchases aggregating at least $12,000,000 of Shares on or prior to the
Termination Date, which condition may not be waived by the Company without the
written consent of the Subscriber.  The Company may hold one or more closings on
any additional subscriptions it may receive.  The certificates representing the
Series C Preferred Stock will be delivered by the Company within ten (10) days
following the Termination Date.

4.   Incidental Registration.  If the Company at any time proposes to register
any of its common Stock under the Act, for its own account or for the account of
any other person or entity (other than any registration of an offering solely to
employees of the Company or its subsidiaries), it shall promptly give written
notice to Subscriber of its intention to do so, and the Company shall include in
such registration, subject to Section 5 hereof, all Shares that Subscriber shall
specify in a written notice delivered to the Company within 20 days after its
receipt of the Company's notice of the proposed filing of the registration
statement, provided that the Company shall not be required to include in such
registration any Shares that Subscriber shall so specify if, in the unqualified
opinion of counsel to the Company reasonably acceptable to the Subscriber so
specifying, registration under the Act is not required for the transfer of such
Shares in the manner requested by Subscriber or that a post-effective amendment
to an existing registration statement would be legally sufficient for such a
transfer and the Company shall have obtained such a post-effective amendment.

5.   Exclusion.  If the proposed or required registration is to be underwritten
(whether on a "best efforts" or a "firm commitment" basis), the managing
underwriter shall have the right to exclude all or any part of Subscriber's
Shares if the underwriter advises the Company in writing that it reasonably
believes that such securities should be withdrawn therefrom.  Any exclusion of
Shares shall be made pro rata among Subscriber and all other persons and/or
entities participating in the registration in proportion to the respective
number of Shares or other securities for which Subscriber and each such other
person or entity have requested

                                      5

registration.

6.   Miscellaneous

          a.  Any notice or other communication given hereunder shall be deemed
sufficient if in writing and sent by registered or certified mail, return
receipt requested, or delivered by hand against written receipt therefor,
addressed to the Company, US Order, Inc., 13873 Park Center Road, Suite 230,
Herndon, VA 22071 and to the Subscriber at his address indicated on the

the parties hereto and to their respective heirs, legal representatives,
successors and assigns. This Agreement sets forth the entire agreement and
understanding between the parties as to the subject matter thereof and merges
and supersedes all prior discussions, agreements and understandings of any and
every nature among them.

          d.  Upon the execution and delivery of this Agreement by the
Subscriber, this Agreement shall become a binding obligation of the Subscriber
with respect to the purchase of Securities as herein provided; subject, however,
to the right hereby reserved to the Company to enter into substantially the same
agreement with other subscribers and to add and/or delete other persons as
subscribers.

          e.  NOTWITHSTANDING THE PLACE WHERE THIS AGREEMENT MAY BE EXECUTED BY
ANY OF THE PARTIES HERETO, THE PARTIES EXPRESSLY AGREE THAT ALL THE TERMS AND
PROVISIONS HEREOF SHALL BE CONSTRUED IN ACCORDANCE WITH AND GOVERNED BY THE LAWS
OF THE STATE OF DELAWARE, WITHOUT REGARD TO PRINCIPLES OF CONFLICTS OF LAW.

          f.  In order to discourage frivolous claims, the parties agree that
unless a claimant in any proceeding succeeds in establishing his claim and
recovering a judgment against another party (regardless of whether such claimant
succeeds against one of the other parties to the action), then the other party
shall be entitled to recover from such claimant all of its/their legal costs and
expenses relating to such proceeding and/or incurred in preparation therefor.

          g.  The holding of any provision of this Agreement to be invalid or
unenforceable by a court of competent jurisdiction shall not affect any other
provision of this Agreement, which shall remain in full force and effect.

                                      6
<PAGE>
 
          h.  It is agreed that a waiver by either party of a breach of any
provision of this Agreement shall not operate, or be construed, as a waiver of
any subsequent breach by that same party.

          i.  The parties agree to execute and deliver all such further
documents, agreements and instruments and take such other and further action as
may be necessary or appropriate to carry out the purposes and intent of this
Agreement.

          j.  This Agreement may be executed in one or more counterparts each of
which shall be deemed an original, but all of which shall together constitute
one and the same instrument.

representations and covenants hereinafter set forth, the parties hereto do
hereby agree as follows:


1.   Subscription for Shares and Representations by Subscriber

          a.  Subject to the terms and conditions hereinafter set forth, the
Subscriber hereby subscribes for and agrees to purchase from the Company and the
Company agrees to sell to the Subscriber 112,202 Shares of Series C Preferred
Stock, for cancellation of the Promissory Note dated November 12, 1993, in the
amount of $800,000, the cancelled original of which is attached hereto and
incorporated herein by reference as Attachment "A".  The rights and preferences
of the Series C Preferred Stock are set forth in the Certificate of Designation
included in the Company's Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation
available upon request from the Company.

          b.  The Subscriber hereby acknowledges (i) receipt of the Company's
Confidential Private Placement Memorandum dated July 15, 1993 (the "Confidential
Memorandum"), the Supplement to the Confidential Private Placement Memorandum
dated July 22, 1993 (the "Supplement"), the Second Supplement to the
Confidential Private Placement Memorandum dated July 29, 1993 (the "Second
Supplement"), the Third Supplement to the Confidential Private Placement
Memorandum dated October 22, 1993 (the "Third Supplement"), and the Fourth
Supplement to the Confidential Private Placement Memorandum dated December 10,
1993, (the "Fourth Supplement"), and (ii) that the Subscriber has carefully
reviewed the Confidential Memorandum and the Supplements thereto.  The
Subscriber hereby acknowledges that the purchase of Shares involves a high
degree of
<PAGE>
 
risk in that (i) an investment in the Company is highly speculative, and only
investors who can afford the loss of their entire investment should consider
investing in the Company and the Shares; (ii) the Subscriber may not be able to
liquidate his investment; (iii) transferability of the Securities is extremely
limited; and (iv) the Subscriber could sustain the loss of his entire
investment.

          c.  The Subscriber hereby acknowledges that he must be a qualified
investor, as described herein, in order to qualify for the purchase of Shares,
and that he must be able to bear the economic risk of an investment in the
Shares.

          d.  The Subscriber hereby represents that he is an "accredited
investor" as such term is defined in Rule 501 of Regulation D promulgated under
the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the "Act"), as indicated by his
responses to the questions contained in Section 6 hereof, and that he is able to
bear the economic risk of an investment in the Shares.

          e.  The Subscriber hereby represents that he has prior investment
experience, including investment in non-listed and non-registered securities, or
he has employed the services of an investment advisor, attorney and/or
accountant to read all of the documents furnished or made available by the
Company both to him and to all other prospective investors in the Shares and to
evaluate the merits and risks of such an investment on his behalf and that he is
able to bear the economic risk he hereby assumes.

          f.  The Subscriber hereby represents that he has been furnished by the
Company during the course of this transaction with all information regarding the
Company which he has requested or desired to know; that he has been afforded the
opportunity to ask questions of and receive answers from duly authorized
officers or other representatives of the Company concerning the terms and
conditions of the Offering, and any additional information which he had
requested.

          g.  The Subscriber hereby acknowledges that the Securities have not
been registered under the Act or any state securities or "blue sky" laws and
that the Offering of Shares has not been reviewed by the United States
Securities and Exchange Commission (the "Commission") or any state regulatory
authority, since the Offering is intended to be exempt from the registration
requirements of Section 5 of the Act pursuant to Section 4(2) of the Act and
pursuant to similar exemptions from registration provided by certain state
securities laws.  The Subscriber hereby represents that he is purchasing the
Shares for his own account, for investment and not with a view to the resale or
distribution of the Series C Preferred Stock or the underlying Common Stock.
The Subscriber agrees that he will not sell or otherwise transfer the Securities
unless they are registered under the Act or unless an exemption from such
registration is available.

          h.  The Subscriber understands that there is no market for the
Securities and that no market is expected to develop for the Securities. The
Subscriber understands that even if a public market develops for the Common
Stock issuable upon conversion of the Series C

                                       2
<PAGE>
 
Preferred Stock, Rule 144 (the "Rule") promulgated under the Act requires, among
other conditions, a two year holding period prior to the resale (in limited
amounts) of securities acquired in a non-public offering without having to
satisfy the registration requirements under the Act.  The Subscriber understands
that the Company is not obligated to comply with any reporting requirements
under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, and that the Company
makes no representation or warranty that it will disseminate to the public any
current financial or other information concerning the Company, as is required by
the Rule as one of the conditions of its availability. The Subscriber
understands and hereby acknowledges that the Company is under no obligation to
register the Series C Preferred Stock under the Act or any state securities or
"blue sky" laws.  The Subscriber consents that the Company may, if it desires,
permit the transfer of the Securities, subject to the provisions set forth in
Section 6, out of his name only when his request for transfer is accompanied by
an opinion of counsel reasonably satisfactory to the Company that neither the
sale nor the proposed transfer results in a violation of the Act or any
applicable state securities or "blue sky" laws.  The Subscriber agrees to hold
the Company and its directors, officers and controlling persons and their
respective heirs, representatives, successors and assigns harmless and to
indemnify them against all liabilities, costs and expenses incurred by them as a
result of any misrepresentation made by him contained herein or in the
Confidential Investor Questionnaire as set forth in Section 6 hereof or any sale
or distribution by the undersigned Subscriber in violation of the Act or any
applicable state securities or "blue sky" laws.

          i.  The Subscriber consents to the placement of a legend on any
certificate or other document evidencing the Series C Preferred Stock or the
Common Stock, stating that such Securities have not been registered under the
Act or any state securities or "blue sky" laws and setting forth or referring to
the restrictions on transferability and sale thereof. The Subscriber is aware
that the Company will make a notation in its appropriate records with respect to
the restrictions on the transferability of such Securities.

          j.  The Subscriber understands that the Company will review this
Agreement and is hereby given authority by the undersigned to call his bank or
place of employment or otherwise review the financial standing of the
Subscriber; and it is further agreed that the Company reserves the unrestricted
right to reject subscriptions in whole or in part and to close the Offer to the
Subscriber at any time.

          k.  The Subscriber hereby represents that the address of the
Subscriber furnished by him on the signature page hereof is the undersigned's
principal residence if he is an individual or its principal business address if
it is a corporation or other entity.

          l.  The Subscriber hereby represents that his total investment in the
Shares does not represent more than five percent (5%) of his net worth and that
his overall commitment to investments which are not readily marketable is
reasonable in relation to his net worth.

          m.  The Subscriber hereby represents that he is willing and able to
bear the 

                                       3
<PAGE>
 
economic risk of this investment, has no need for liquidity of this investment
and is able to sustain a complete loss of the investment.

          n.  The Subscriber understands the significance to the Company of its
representations, including those in Section 8, and they are made with the
intention that the Company will rely on them.


2.   Representations by the Company

          The Company represents and warrants to the Subscriber that on the date
of consummation of the Offering:

          c.  The Shares will have been duly and validly authorized and when
issued and paid for in accordance with the terms hereof, will be duly and
validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable;

          d.  The Company will, at all times that the Shares are outstanding,
have authorized and reserved a sufficient number of shares of Common Stock to
provide for conversion of the Shares;

          e.  The shares of Common Stock issuable upon conversion of the Series
C Preferred Stock, when issued and paid for in accordance with the terms of the
Series C Preferred Stock, will be duly and validly issued, fully paid and
nonassessable;

          f.  The Company will not be in any material respect in violation of or
in default in any material respect under, nor will the execution and delivery of
this Agreement, or the issuance of the Series C Preferred Stock and the
incurrence of the obligations herein set forth and the consummation of the
transactions herein contemplated, result in a material violation of, or
constitute a material default under, the Amended and Restated Certificate of
Incorporation or the By-laws of the Company; and

          g.  The Company shall provide each holder of at least 5% of the
original issuance of Series C Preferred Stock (or that number of shares of
Common Stock into which all or part of such percentage of the original issuance

                                       4
<PAGE>
 
of Series C Preferred Stock is converted) with unaudited quarterly financial
statements within 60 days of the end of each quarter, audited annual financial
statements within 90 days of the end of each fiscal year and such other
financial information as such holders of Series C Preferred Stock may
reasonably request from time to time. The right to receive such financial
information pursuant to this Agreement shall not be assignable by the
Subscriber without the prior written consent of the Company and shall
terminate upon the sale by the Company of Common Stock or any class or series
of securities convertible into Common Stock in an initial public offering.


3.   Terms of Subscription

          a.   The subscription period will terminate at 11:59 p.m., Washington,
D.C. time, on December 15, 1993, unless extended by the Company at its
discretion for an additional period not to exceed 90 days (the "Termination
Date").

          b.   The minimum subscription per Subscriber shall be for $1,000,000
of the Series C Preferred Stock, subject to the Company's right to accept or
reject subscriptions in whole or in part.

          c.   A closing will take place if the Company receives subscriptions
for purchases aggregating at least $12,000,000 of Shares on or prior to the
Termination Date, which condition may not be waived by the Company without the
written consent of the Subscriber.  The Company may hold one or more closings on
any additional subscriptions it may receive.  The certificates representing the
Series C Preferred Stock will delivered by the Company within ten (10) days
following the Termination Date.

4.   Incidental Registration.  If the Company at any time proposes to register
any of its common Stock under the Act, for its own account or for the account of
any other person or entity (other than any registration of an offering solely to
employees of the Company or its subsidiaries), it shall promptly give written
notice to Subscriber of its intention to do so, and the Company shall include in
such registration, subject to Section 5 hereof, all Shares that Subscriber shall
specify in a written notice delivered to the Company within 20 days after its
receipt of the Company's notice of the proposed filing of the registration
statement, provided that the Company shall not be required to include in such
registration any Shares that Subscriber shall so specify if, in the unqualified
opinion of counsel to the Company reasonably acceptable to the Subscriber so
specifying, registration under the Act is not required for the transfer of such
Shares in the manner requested by Subscriber or that a post-effective amendment
to an existing registration statement would be legally sufficient for such a
transfer and the Company shall have obtained such a post-effective amendment.

5.   Exclusion.  If the proposed or required registration is to be underwritten
(whether on a "best efforts" or a "firm commitment" basis), the managing
underwriter shall have the right to exclude all or any part of Subscriber's
Shares if the underwriter advises the Company in writing that it reasonably
believes that such securities should be withdrawn therefrom.  Any

                                       5
<PAGE>
 
exclusion of Shares shall be made pro rata among Subscriber and all other
persons and/or entities participating in the registration in proportion to the
respective number of Shares or other securities for which Subscriber and each
such other person or entity have requested registration.

6.   Miscellaneous

          a.  Any notice or other communication given hereunder shall be deemed
sufficient if in writing and sent by registered or certified mail, return
receipt requested, or delivered by hand against written receipt therefor,

Herndon, VA 22071 and to the Subscriber at his address indicated on the

successors and assigns. This Agreement sets forth the entire agreement and
understanding between the parties as to the subject matter thereof and merges
and supersedes all prior discussions, agreements and understandings of any and
every nature among them.

agreement with other subscribers and to add and/or delete other persons as
subscribers.

          e.  NOTWITHSTANDING THE PLACE WHERE THIS AGREEMENT MAY BE EXECUTED BY

PROVISIONS HEREOF SHALL BE CONSTRUED IN ACCORDANCE WITH AND GOVERNED BY THE LAWS
OF THE STATE OF DELAWARE, WITHOUT REGARD TO PRINCIPLES OF CONFLICTS OF LAW.

          f.  In order to discourage frivolous claims, the parties agree that
unless a claimant in any proceeding succeeds in establishing his claim and
recovering a judgment against another party (regardless of whether such claimant
succeeds against one of the other parties to the action), then the other party
shall be entitled to recover from such claimant all of its/their legal costs and
expenses relating to such proceeding and/or incurred in preparation therefor.

          g.  The holding of any provision of this Agreement to be invalid or
unenforceable by

                                       6
<PAGE>
 
a court of competent jurisdiction shall not affect any other provision of this
Agreement, which shall remain in full force and effect.

          h.  It is agreed that a waiver by either party of a breach of any
provision of this Agreement shall not operate, or be construed, as a waiver of
any subsequent breach by that same party.

          i.  The parties agree to execute and deliver all such further
documents, agreements and instruments and take such other and further action as
may be necessary or appropriate to carry out the purposes and intent of this
Agreement.

          j.  This Agreement may be executed in one or more counterparts each of

                                     9.
<PAGE>
 
Company's business as proposed to be conducted.  Neither the execution nor
delivery of this Agreement, the Investment Agreement or any Ancillary Agreement,
nor the carrying on of the Company's business by the employees of the Company,
nor the conduct of the Company's business as proposed, will, to the best of the
Company's knowledge, conflict with or result in a breach of the terms,
conditions, or provisions of, or constitute a default under, any contract,
covenant, or instrument under which any of such employees is now obligated.  The
Company does not believe it is or will be necessary to use any inventions of any
of its employees (or persons it currently intends to hire) made prior to their
employment by the Company.

judgment, decree, or order, or any term of any employment contract, patent
disclosure agreement, or other contract or agreement relating to the
relationship of any such employee with the Company or any other party because of
the nature of the business conducted or to be conducted by the Company or to the
use by the employee of his or her best efforts with respect to such business.
The Company is not a party to or bound by any currently effective employment
contract, deferred compensation agreement, bonus plan, incentive plan, profit
sharing plan, retirement agreement, or other employee compensation agreement.

3.   REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF INVESTOR.

     Investor hereby represents and warrants that:

     3.1  Authorization.

          Investor has full power and authority to enter into this Agreement and
that this Agreement constitutes a valid and legally binding obligation of
Investor.

     3.2  Purchase Entirely for Own Account.

          This Agreement is made with Investor in reliance upon Investor's
representation to the Company, which by Investor's execution of this Agreement
Investor hereby confirms, that the Series C Preferred Stock to be purchased by
Investor and the Common Stock issuable upon conversion thereof (collectively,
the "Securities") will be acquired for investment for Investor's own account,
not as a nominee or agent, and not with a view to the resale or distribution of
any part thereof, and that Investor has no present intention of selling,
granting any participation in, or otherwise distributing the same.  By executing
this Agreement, Investor further represents that Investor does not have any
contract, undertaking, agreement or arrangement with any person to sell,
transfer or grant participations to such person or to any third person, with
respect to any of the Securities.

     3.3  Reliance Upon Investor's Representations.

          Investor understands that the Series C Preferred Stock is not, and any
Common Stock acquired on conversion thereof at the time of issuance may not be,
registered under the Securities Act on the ground that the sale provided for in
this Agreement and the issuance of securities hereunder is exempt from
registration under the Securities Act pursuant

                                     12.
<PAGE>
 
to Section 4(2) thereof, and that the Company's reliance on such exemption is
predicated on the Investor's representations set forth herein.  Investor
realizes that the basis for the exemption may not be present if, notwithstanding
such representations, Investor has in mind merely acquiring shares of the Series
C Preferred Stock for a fixed or determinable period in the future, or for a
market rise, or for sale if the market does not rise.  Investor has no such
intention.

     3.4  Receipt of Information.

          Investor believes it has received all the information it considers
necessary or appropriate for deciding whether to purchase the Series C Preferred
Stock.  Investor further represents that it has had an opportunity to ask
questions and receive answers from the Company regarding the terms and
conditions of the offering of the Series C Preferred Stock and the business,
properties, prospects, and financial condition of the Company and to obtain
additional information (to the extent the Company possessed such information or
could acquire it without unreasonable effort or expense) necessary to verify the
accuracy of any information furnished to it or to which it had access.  The
foregoing, however, does not limit or modify the representations and warranties
of the Company in Section 2 of this Agreement or the right of Investor to rely
thereon.

     3.5  Investment Experience.

          Investor represents that it is experienced in evaluating and investing
in securities of companies in the development state and acknowledges that it is
able to fend for itself, can bear the economic risk of its investment, and has
such knowledge and experience in financial and business matters that it is
capable of evaluating the merits and risks of the investment in the Series C
Preferred Stock.  Investor also represents it has not been organized for the
purpose of acquiring the Series C Preferred Stock.

     3.6  Accredited Investor.

          (a)  The term "Accredited Investor" as used herein refers to:

               (1)  A person or entity who is a director or executive officer 
of the Company;

               (2)  Any bank as defined in Section 3(a)(2) of the Securities
Act, or any savings and loan association or other institution as defined in
Section 3(a)(5)(A) of the Securities Act whether acting in its individual or
fiduciary capacity; any broker or dealer registered pursuant to Section 15 of
the Securities Exchange Act of 1934; any insurance company as defined in
Section 2(13) of the Securities Act; any investment company registered under
the Investment Company Act of 1940 or a business development company as
defined in Section 2(a)(48) of that Act; any Small Business Investment Company
licensed by the U.S. Small Business Administration under Section 301(c) or (d)

<PAGE>
 
subdivisions, or any agency or instrumentality of a state or its political
subdivisions, for the benefit of its employees, if such plan has total assets of
$5,000,000; any employee benefit plan within the meaning of Title I of the
Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, if the investment decision is
made by a plan fiduciary, as defined in Section 3(21) of such Act, which is
either a bank, savings and loan association, insurance company, or registered
investment adviser, or if the employee benefit plan has total assets in excess
of $5,000,000 or, if a self-directed plan, with investment decisions made solely
by persons that are accredited investors;

               (3)  Any private business development company as defined in
Section 202(a)(22) of the Investment Advisers Act of 1940;

               (4)  Any organization described in Section 501(c)(3) of the
Internal Revenue Code, corporation, Massachusetts or similar business trust,
or partnership, not formed for the specific purpose of acquiring the
securities offered, with total assets in excess of $5,000,000;

               (5)  Any natural person whose individual net worth, or joint
net worth with that person's spouse, at the time of his purchase exceeds
$1,000,000;

               (6)  Any natural person who had an individual income in excess of
$200,000 in each of the two most recent years or joint income with that person's
spouse in excess of $300,000 in each of those years and has a reasonable
expectation of reaching the same income level in the current year;

               (7)  Any trust, with total assets in excess of $5,000,000, not

purchase is directed by a person who has such knowledge and experience in
financial and business matters that he is capable of evaluating the merits and
risks of the prospective investment; or

               (8)  Any entity in which all of the equity owners are
accredited investors.

     As used in this Section 3.6(a), the term "net worth" means the excess of
total assets over total liabilities.  For the purpose of determining a person's
net worth, the principal residence owned by an individual should be valued at
fair market value, including the cost of improvements, net of current
encumbrances.  As used in this Section 3.6(a), "income" means actual economic
income, which may differ from adjusted gross income for income tax purposes.
Accordingly, the undersigned should consider whether it should add any or all of
the following items to its adjusted gross income for income tax purposes in
order to reflect more accurately its actual economic income:  any amounts
attributable to tax-exempt income received, losses claimed as a limited partner
in any limited partnership, deductions claimed for depletion, contributions to
an IRA or Keogh retirement plan, and alimony payments.

                                     14.
<PAGE>
 
          (b)  Investor further represents to the Company that Investor is an
Accredited Investor.

     3.7  Restricted Securities.

          Investor understands that the Series C Preferred Stock (and any Common
Stock issued on conversion thereof) may not be sold, transferred, or otherwise
disposed of without registration under the 1933 Act or an exemption therefrom,
and that in the absence of an effective registration statement covering the
Stock (or the Common Stock issued on conversion thereof) or an available
exemption from registration under the 1933 Act, the Stock (and any Common Stock
issued on conversion thereof) must be held indefinitely.  In particular,
Investor is aware that the Series C Preferred Stock (and any Common Stock issued
on conversion thereof) may not be sold pursuant to Rule 144 promulgated under
the Securities Act unless all of the conditions of that Rule are met.  Among the
conditions for use of Rule 144 may be the availability of current information to
the public about the Company.  Such information is not now available and the
Company has no present plans to make such information available.

Section 2.19  Changes

     1.       Bell Atlantic's current agreement with US Order runs through
              April 7, 1994. US Order is continuing discussions with Bell
              Atlantic regarding an additional extension of that agreement.
                                                                          
              Bell Atlantic, which distributed a Request for Information in
              October 1993, to prospective ADSI screen-based telephone
              providers under which it indicated its interest in playing a key
              role in the industry, to which US Order responded, decided in

              May 17, 1993, has not yet made a commitment to participate in

              with respect to the manufacture, use and sale of new products
              and services that are the subject of conflicting patent rights.
              There can be no assurance that any patents owned or controlled
              by US Order will afford commercially significant protection of
              its

                                      3.
<PAGE>
 
          technology.  US Order's patents have not been tested in court, and
          litigation may be necessary to determine validity and scope of US
          Order's rights.  Moreover, the patent laws of foreign countries differ
          from those of the United States and the degree of protection afforded
          by foreign patents may, therefore, vary.  All patent applications
          relate to obtaining patent coverage for US Order's existing patent in
          foreign countries, with the exception of a continuation application
          filed on March 30, 1993 with regard to the original patent.  The grant
          of a patent does not protect a company from infringement litigation by
          third parties in the future.

          US Order owns U.S. Patent No. 4,947,028 and pending patent
          applications which cover various proprietary aspects of its automated
          order and payment system.  On February 3, 1992, the U.S. Patent and
          Trademark Office ("PTO") issued an order granting the request of
          Portel Network Services, Inc. to reexamine US Order's patent based on
          a previously issued patent to that party.  Additional prior patents
          and printed publications were considered by the PTO as well.  On April
          9, 1993, the PTO issued a Notice of Intent to Reissue Reexamination
          Certificate confirming patentability of most of the patent claims, as
          amended during the reexamination proceedings.  The PTO's Reexamination
          Certificate was issued on June 8, 1993.  The third party requester has
          no appeal rights.  While there can be no guarantee, a patent that has
          undergone reexamination is generally regarded as being more likely to
          withstand validity challenges in the future, where such challenges are
          based upon the same or substantially the same prior patents and
          printed publications as were reviewed by the PTO during the
          reexamination proceedings.

          In November 1991, US Order received a letter from Lawrence D'Angelis
          bringing to US Order's attention a patent issued to such party,
          entitled home Merchandise Ordering Telecommunications Terminal, which
          such party subsequently claimed was infringed by US Order.  In US
          Order's patent counsel's opinion, there is no infringement, and US
          Order advised such party that US Order's technology did not infringe
          any claims of such patent.  Nonetheless, there can be no assurance
          that such party will drop its claim of infringement or that US Order
          would prevail in any proceeding in relation thereto.

          See also Section 2.10 Permits.

     2.   Trademarks

          US Order received a letter dated December 6, 1993 from counsel for
          Taurus Publishing, Inc. which publishes a newsletter entitled Phone+,
          claiming unauthorized use by US Order of the name for the Company's
          next generation product, PhonePlus.  Counsel to US Order was aware of
          this newsletter prior

                                     4.
<PAGE>
 
              to delivering his opinion that the name was available for use by
              US Order, and has informed US Order it is still his opinion that
              US Order may use this name.

                               US ORDER, INC.
                        REGISTRATION RIGHTS AGREEMENT


     THIS REGISTRATION RIGHTS AGREEMENT (the "Agreement") is made and entered
into as of the 21st day of December 1993, by and between US ORDER, INC., a
Delaware corporation (the "Company"), and all purchasers of the Company's Series
C Preferred Stock, as listed on Schedule A attached hereto.

     NOW THEREFORE, in consideration of the mutual promises and covenants set
forth herein, the Company and each Investor, as defined below, hereby agrees as
follows:

     1.  DEFINITIONS.

         1.1 Certain Definitions. As used in this Agreement, the following
terms shall have the meanings set forth below:

             (a) "Closing" shall mean the date of the initial sale of shares
of the Company's Series C Preferred Stock.

             (h) "Registrable Securities" shall mean (i) shares of Common

<PAGE>
 
include any shares of Common Stock which have previously been registered or
which have been sold to the public, or which have been sold in a private
transaction in which the transferor's rights under this Agreement are not
assignable or assigned.

             (i) The terms "register," "registered" and "registration" shall

Company, the latter of which shall be paid in any event by the Company.

             (k) "Restricted Securities" shall mean any Registrable Securities

the Company.

        1.2  Restrictions on Transfer.  Each Holder agrees not to make any
disposition of all or any portion of the Registrable Securities unless and until

by this Section 1.2, provided and to the extent such Section is then applicable
and:

                                      2.
<PAGE>
 
             (i)   There is then in effect a registration statement under the
Securities Act covering such proposed disposition and such disposition is made
in accordance with such registration statement; or

             (ii)  (A) Such Holder shall have notified the Company of the
proposed disposition and shall have furnished the Company with a detailed
statement of the circumstances surrounding the proposed disposition, and (B)
if reasonably requested by the Company, such Holder shall have furnished the
Company with an opinion of counsel, reasonably satisfactory to the Company,
that such disposition will not require registration of such shares under the
Securities Act. It is agreed that the Company will not require opinions of
counsel for transactions made pursuant to Rule 144 except in unusual
circumstances.

             (iii) Notwithstanding the provisions of paragraphs (i) and (ii)
above, no such registration statement or opinion of counsel shall be necessary
for a transfer by a Holder which is (A) a partnership to its partners or
retired partners in accordance with partnership interests, or (B) to the
Holder's family member or trust for the benefit of an individual Holder,
provided the transferee will be subject to the terms of this Section 1.2 to
the same extent as if such transferee were an original Holder hereunder.

         (a) Each certificate representing Registrable Securities shall
(unless otherwise permitted by the provisions of this Agreement) be stamped or
otherwise imprinted with a legend substantially similar to the following (in
addition to any legend required under applicable state securities laws):

     THE SHARES REPRESENTED HEREBY HAVE NOT BEEN REGISTERED UNDER THE SECURITIES
     ACT OF 1933, AS AMENDED, AND MAY NOT BE SOLD OR TRANSFERRED, ASSIGNED,
     PLEDGED OR HYPOTHECATED UNLESS AND UNTIL REGISTERED UNDER SUCH ACT OR
     UNLESS THE COMPANY HAS RECEIVED AN OPINION OF COUNSEL OR OTHER EVIDENCE,
     SATISFACTORY TO THE COMPANY AND ITS COUNSEL, THAT SUCH REGISTRATION IS NOT
     REQUIRED.

         (b) The Company shall be obligated to reissue promptly unlegended
certificates at the request of any Holder thereof if the Holder shall have
obtained an opinion at such Holder's expense of counsel (which counsel may be
counsel to the Company) reasonably acceptable to the Company to the effect
that the securities proposed to be disposed of may lawfully be so disposed of
without registration, qualification or legend.

         (c) Any legend endorsed on an instrument pursuant to applicable state
securities laws and the stop-transfer instructions with respect to such
securities shall be removed upon receipt by the Company of an order of the
appropriate blue sky authority authorizing such removal.

    1.3  Requested Registration.

         (a) Request for Registration.  If the Company shall receive from
Initiating Holders at any time or times not earlier than the earlier of (i)
three years after the date

                                     3.
<PAGE>
 
of this Agreement or (ii) one year after the effective date of the first
registration statement filed by the Company covering an underwritten offering of
any of its securities to the general public that is declared or ordered
effective, a written request that the Company effect any registration with
respect to all or a part of the Registrable Securities, the aggregate expected
price to the public of which equals at least $7,500,000, the Company will:

                    (i)  promptly give written notice of the proposed
registration to all other Holders; and

                    (ii) as soon as practicable, use its best efforts to effect
such registration (including, without limitation, filing post-effective
amendments, appropriate qualifications under applicable blue sky or other state
securities laws, and appropriate compliance with the Securities Act) and as
would permit or facilitate the sale and distribution of all or such portion of
such Registrable Securities as are specified in a written request received by
the Company within ten (10) days after such written notice from the Company is
mailed or delivered.

     The Company shall not be obligated to effect, or to take any action to
effect, any such registration pursuant to this Section 1.3:

                         (A)  In any particular jurisdiction in which the
Company would be required to execute a general consent to service of process in
effecting such registration, qualification, or compliance, unless the Company is
already subject to service in such jurisdiction and except as may be required by
the Securities Act;

                         (B)  After the Company has initiated two such
registrations pursuant to this Section 1.3(a) (counting for these purposes only
registrations which have been declared or ordered effective and pursuant to
which securities have been sold and registrations which have been withdrawn by
the Holders as to which the Holders have not elected to bear the Registration
Expenses pursuant to Section 1.5 hereof and would, absent such election, have
been required to bear such expenses);

                         (C)  During the period starting with the date sixty
(60) days prior to the Company's good faith estimate of the date of filing of,
and ending on a date one hundred eighty (180) days after the effective date of,
a Company-initiated registration; provided that the Company is actively
employing in good faith all reasonable efforts to cause such registration
statement to become effective;

                         (D)  If the Initiating Holders propose to dispose of
shares of Registrable Securities which may be immediately registered on Form S-3
pursuant to a request made under Section 1.6 hereof;

                         (E)  If the Initiating Holders do not request that such
offering be firmly underwritten by underwriters selected by the Initiating
Holders (subject to the consent of the Company, which consent will not be
unreasonably withheld); or

                                     4.
<PAGE>
 
                        (F) If the Company and the Initiating Holders are
unable to obtain the commitment of the underwriter described in clause (E)
above to firmly underwrite the offer.

             (b)  Subject to the foregoing clauses (A) through (F), the
Company shall file a registration statement covering the Registrable Securities
so requested to be registered as soon as practicable after receipt of the
request or requests of the Initiating Holders; provided, however, that if (i) in
the good faith judgment of the Board of Directors of the Company, such
registration would be seriously detrimental to the Company and the Board of
Directors of the Company concludes, as a result, that it is essential to defer
the filing of such registration statement at such time, and (ii) the Company
shall furnish to such Holders a certificate signed by the Chief Executive
Officer of the Company stating that in the good faith judgment of the Board of
Directors of the Company, it would be seriously detrimental to the Company for
such registration statement to be filed in the near future and that it is,
therefore, essential to defer the filing of such registration statement, then
the Company shall have the right to defer such filing (except as provided in
clause (C) above) for a period of not more than one hundred eighty (180) days
after the receipt of the request of the Initiating Holders, and, provided
further, that the Company shall not defer its obligation in this manner more
than once in any twelve-month period.

     The registration statement filed pursuant to the request of the Initiating
Holders may, subject to the provisions of Sections 1.3(b) and 1.14 hereof,
include other securities of the Company, with respect to which registration
rights have been granted, and may include securities of the Company being sold
for the account of the Company.

             (c)  Underwriting.  The right of any Holder to registration
pursuant to Section 1.3 shall be conditioned upon such Holder's participation in
such underwriting and the inclusion of such Holder's Registrable Securities in
the underwriting (unless otherwise mutually agreed by a majority in interest of
the Initiating Holders and such Holder with respect to such participation and
inclusion) to the extent provided herein.  A Holder may elect to include in such
underwriting all or a part of the Registrable Securities such Holder holds.

             (d)  Procedures.  If the Company shall request inclusion in any
registration pursuant to Section 1.3 of securities being sold for its own
account, or if other persons shall request inclusion in any registration
pursuant to Section 1.3, the Initiating Holders shall, on behalf of all Holders,
offer to include such securities in the underwriting and may condition such
offer on their acceptance of the further applicable provisions of this Section 1
(including Section 1.13).  The Company shall (together with all Holders and
other persons proposing to distribute their securities through such
underwriting) enter into an underwriting agreement in customary form with the
representative of the underwriter or underwriters selected for such underwriting
by a majority in interest of the Initiating Holders, which underwriters are
reasonably acceptable to the Company.  Notwithstanding any other provision of
this Section 1.3, if the representative of the underwriters advises the
Initiating Holders in writing that marketing factors require a limitation on the
number of shares to be underwritten, the number of shares to be included in the
underwriting or registration shall be allocated as set forth in Section 1.14

                                     5.
<PAGE>
 
hereof.  If a person who has requested inclusion in such registration as
provided above does not agree to the terms of any such underwriting, such person
shall be excluded therefrom by written notice from the Company, the underwriter
or the Initiating Holders.  Any Registrable Securities or other securities
excluded or withdrawn from such underwriting shall also be withdrawn from such
registration.  If shares are so withdrawn from the registration and if the
number of shares to be included in such registration was previously reduced as a
result of marketing factors pursuant to this Section 1.3(d), then the Company
shall offer to all Holders who have retained rights to include securities in the
registration the right to include additional securities in the registration in
an aggregate amount equal to the number of shares so withdrawn, with such shares
to be allocated among such Holders requesting additional inclusion in accordance
with Section 1.14.

          1.4  Company Registration.

               (a)  If the Company shall determine to register any of its
securities either for its own account or the account of a security holder or
holders exercising their respective demand registration rights (other than
pursuant to Section 1.3 or 1.6 hereof), other than a registration relating
solely to employee benefit plans, or a registration relating solely to a Rule
145 transaction, or a registration on any registration form that does not permit
secondary sales, the Company will:

                    (i) promptly give to each Holder written notice thereof; and

                    (ii) use its best efforts to include in such registration
(and any related qualification under blue sky laws or other compliance),
except as set forth in Section 1.4(b) below, and in any underwriting involved
therein, all the Registrable Securities specified in a written request or
requests, made by any Holder and received by the Company within ten (10) days
after the written notice from the Company described in clause (i) above is
mailed or delivered by the Company. Such written request may specify all or a
part of a Holder's Registrable Securities.

               (b)  Underwriting.  If the registration of which the Company
gives notice is for a registered public offering involving an underwriting, the
Company shall so advise the Holders as a part of the written notice given
pursuant to Section l.4(a)(i).  In such event, the right of any Holder to
registration pursuant to this Section 1.4 shall be conditioned upon such
Holder's participation in such underwriting and the inclusion of such Holder's
Registrable Securities in the underwriting to the extent provided herein.  All
Holders proposing to distribute their securities through such underwriting shall
(together with the Company and the other holders of securities of the Company
with registration rights to participate therein distributing their securities
through such underwriting) enter into an underwriting agreement in customary
form with the representative of the underwriter or underwriters selected by the
Company.

     Notwithstanding any other provision of this Section 1.4, if the
representative of the underwriters advises the Company in writing that marketing
factors require a limitation on the number of shares to be underwritten, the
representative may (subject to the limitations set forth

                                     6.
<PAGE>
 
below) exclude all Registrable Securities from, or limit the number of
Registrable Securities to be included in, the registration and underwriting.
The Company shall so advise all Holders of securities requesting registration,
and the number of shares of securities that are entitled to be included in the
registration and underwriting shall be allocated first to the Company for
securities being sold for its own account and thereafter as set forth in Section
1.14.  If any person does not agree to the terms of any such underwriting, such
person shall be excluded therefrom by written notice from the Company or the
underwriter.  Any Registrable Securities or other securities excluded or
withdrawn from such underwriting shall also be withdrawn from such registration.

     If shares are so withdrawn from the registration or if the number of shares
of Registrable Securities to be included in such registration was previously
reduced as a result of marketing factors, the Company shall then offer to all
persons who have retained the right to include securities in the registration
the right to include additional securities in the registration in an aggregate
amount equal to the number of shares so withdrawn, with such shares to be
allocated among the persons requesting additional inclusion in accordance with
Section 1.14 hereof.

          1.5  Expenses of Registration.  All Registration Expenses incurred in
connection with any registration, qualification or compliance pursuant to
Sections 1.4 and 1.6 hereof, and the first two registrations pursuant to Section
1.3 hereof and reasonable fees of one counsel for the selling stockholders in
the case of registrations pursuant to Sections 1.3 and 1.4 shall be borne by the
Company; provided, however, that if the Holders bear the Registration Expenses
for any registration proceeding begun pursuant to Section 1.3 and subsequently
withdrawn by the Holders registering shares therein, such registration
proceeding shall not be counted as a requested registration pursuant to Section
1.3 hereof.  Furthermore, in the event that a withdrawal by the Holders is based
upon material adverse information relating to the Company that is different from
the information known or available (upon request from the Company or otherwise)
to the Holders requesting registration at the time of their request for
registration under Section 1.3, such registration shall not be treated as a
counted registration for purposes of Section 1.3 hereof, even though the Holders
do not bear the Registration Expenses for such registration.  All Selling
Expenses relating to securities so registered shall be borne by the Holders of
such securities pro rata on the basis of the number of shares of securities so
registered on their behalf, as shall be any other expenses in connection with
the registration required to be borne by the Holders of such securities.

          1.6  Registration on Form S-3.

               (a)  After its initial public offering, the Company shall use its
best efforts to qualify for registration on Form S-3 or any comparable or
successor form or forms. After the Company has qualified for the use of Form 
S-3, as an alternative to the rights contained in subsection 1.3 of this
Section 1, the Holders of not less than fifteen percent (15%) of the
Registrable Securities then held by Holders shall have the right to request
two (2) registrations on Form S-3 (such requests shall be in writing and shall
state the number of shares of Registrable Securities to be disposed of and the
intended methods of disposition of such shares by such Holder or Holders),
provided, however, that the Company shall not be obligated to

                                     7.
<PAGE>
 
effect any such registration if (i) the Holders, together with the holders of
any other securities of the Company entitled to inclusion in such registration,
propose to sell Registrable Securities and such other securities (if any) on
Form S-3 at an aggregate price to the public of less than $1,000,000, or (ii) in
the event that the Company shall furnish the certification described in
paragraph 1.3(a)(ii) (but subject to the limitations set forth therein) or (iii)
in a given twelve-month period, the Company has effected one (1) such
registration in such period or (iv) it is to be effected more than five (5)
years after the Company's initial public offering.

               (b)  If a request complying with the requirements of Section
1.6(a) hereof is delivered to the Company, the provisions of Sections 1.3(a)(i)
and (ii) and Section 1.3(b) hereof shall apply to such registration.  If the
registration is for an underwritten offering, the provisions of Sections 1.3(c)
and 1.3(d) hereof shall apply to such registration.

          1.7  Registration Procedures.  In the case of each registration
effected by the Company pursuant to Section 1, the Company will keep each Holder
advised in writing as to the initiation of each registration and as to the
completion thereof.  At its expense, the Company will use its best efforts to:

               (a)  Keep such registration effective for a period of one hundred
twenty (120) days or until the Holder or Holders have completed the distribution
described in the registration statement relating thereto, whichever first
occurs; provided, however, that (i) such 120-day period shall be extended for a
period of time equal to the period the Holder refrains from selling any
securities included in such registration at the request of an underwriter of
Common Stock (or other securities) of the Company; and (ii) in the case of any
registration of Registrable Securities on Form S-3 which are intended to be
offered on a continuous or delayed basis, such 120-day period shall be extended,
if necessary, to keep the registration statement effective until all such
Registrable Securities are sold, provided that Rule 145, or any successor rule
under the Securities Act, permits an offering on a continuous or delayed basis,
and provided further that applicable rules under the Securities Act governing
the obligation to file a post-effective amendment permit, in lieu of filing a
post-effective amendment that (I) includes any prospectus required by Section
10(a)(3) of the Securities Act or (II) reflects facts or events representing a
material or fundamental change in the information set forth in the registration
statement, the incorporation by reference of information required to be included
in (I) and (II) above to be contained in periodic reports filed pursuant to
Section 13 or 15(d) of the Exchange Act in the registration statement;

               (b)  Prepare and file with the Commission such amendments and
supplements to such registration statement and the prospectus used in connection
with such registration statement as may be necessary to comply with the
provisions of the Securities Act with respect to the disposition of all
securities covered by such registration statement;

               (c)  Furnish such number of prospectuses and other documents
incident thereto, including any amendment of or supplement to the prospectus, as
a Holder from, time to time may reasonably request;

                                     8.
<PAGE>
 
               (d)  Cause all such Registrable Securities registered pursuant
hereunder to be listed on each securities exchange on which similar securities
issued by the Company are then listed;

               (e)  Provide a transfer agent and registrar for all Registrable
Securities registered pursuant to such registration statement and a CUSIP number
for all such Registrable Securities, in each case not later than the effective
date of such registration;

               (f)  Otherwise use its best efforts to comply with all applicable
rules and regulations of the Commission, and make available to its security
holders, as soon as reasonably practicable, an earnings statement covering the
period of at least twelve months, but not more than eighteen months, beginning
with the first month after the effective date of the Registration Statement,
which earnings statement shall satisfy the provisions of Section 11(a) of the
Securities Act; and

               (g)  In connection with any underwritten offering pursuant to a
registration statement filed pursuant to Section 1.3 hereof, the Company will
enter into an underwriting agreement in form reasonably necessary to effect the
offer and sale of Common Stock, provided such underwriting agreement contains
customary underwriting provisions and provided further that if the underwriter
so requests the underwriting agreement will contain customary contribution
provisions.

          1.8  Indemnification.

               (a)  The Company will indemnify each Holder, each of its
officers, directors and partners, legal counsel, and accountants and each person
controlling such Holder within the meaning of Section 15 of the Securities Act,
with respect to which registration, qualification, or compliance has been
effected pursuant to this Section 1, and each underwriter, if any, and each
person who controls within the meaning of Section 15 of the Securities Act any
underwriter, against all expenses, claims, losses, damages, and liabilities (or
actions, proceedings, or settlements in respect thereof) arising out of or based
on any untrue statement (or alleged untrue statement) of a material fact
contained in any prospectus, offering circular, or other document (including any
related registration statement, notification, or the like) incident to any such
registration, qualification, or compliance, or based on any omission (or alleged
omission) to state therein a material fact required to be stated therein or
necessary to make the statement therein not misleading, or any violation by the
Company of the Securities Act or any rule or regulation thereunder applicable to
the Company and relating to action or inaction required of the Company in
connection with any such registration, qualification, or compliance, and will
reimburse each such Holder, each of its officers, directors, partners, legal
counsel, and accountants and each person controlling such Holder, each such
underwriter, and each person who controls any such underwriter, for any legal
and any other expenses reasonably incurred in connection with investigating and
defending or settling any such claim, loss, damage, liability, or action,
provided that the Company will not be liable in any such case to the extent that
any such claim, loss, damage, liability, or expense arises out of or is based on
any untrue statement or omission based upon written information furnished to the
Company by such Holder or

                                     9.
<PAGE>
 
underwriter and stated to be specifically for use therein.  It is agreed that
the indemnity agreement contained in this Section 1.8(a) shall not apply to
amounts paid in settlement of any such loss, claim, damage, liability, or action
if such settlement is effected without the consent of the Company (which consent
has not been unreasonably withheld).

               (b)  Each Holder will, if Registrable Securities held by such
Holder are included in the securities as to which such registration,
qualification, or compliance is being effected, indemnify the Company, each of
its directors, officers, partners, legal counsel, and accountants and each
underwriter, if any, of the Company's securities covered by such a registration
statement, each person who controls the Company or such underwriter within the
meaning of Section 15 of the Securities Act, each other such Holder and Other
Stockholder, and each of their officers, directors, and partners, and each
person controlling such Holder or Other Stockholder, against all claims, losses,
damages and liabilities (or actions in respect thereof) arising out of or based
on any untrue statement (or alleged untrue statement) of a material fact
contained in any such registration statement, prospectus, offering circular, or
other document, or any omission (or alleged omission) to state therein a
material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements
therein not misleading, and will reimburse the Company and such Holders, Other
Stockholders, directors, officers, partners, legal counsel, and accountants,
persons, underwriters, or control persons for any legal or any other expenses
reasonably incurred in connection with investigating or defending any such
claim, loss, damage, liability, or action, in each case to the extent, but only
to the extent, that such untrue statement (or alleged untrue statement) or
omission (or alleged omission) is made in such registration statement,
prospectus, offering circular, or other document in reliance upon and in
conformity with written information furnished to the Company by such Holder and
stated to be specifically for use therein provided, however, that the
obligations of such Holder hereunder shall not apply to amounts paid in
settlement of any such claims, losses, damages, or liabilities (or actions in
respect thereof) if such settlement is effected without the consent of such
Holder (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld); and provided that in
no event shall any indemnity under this Section 1.8 exceed the gross proceeds
from the offering received by such Holder.

               (c)  Each party entitled to indemnification under this Section
1.8 (the "Indemnified Party") shall give notice to the party required to provide
indemnification (the "Indemnifying Party") promptly after such Indemnified Party
has actual knowledge of any claim as to which indemnity may be sought, and shall
permit the Indemnifying Party to assume the defense of such claim or any
litigation resulting therefrom, provided that counsel for the Indemnifying
Party, who shall conduct the defense of such claim or any litigation resulting
therefrom, shall be approved by the Indemnified Party (whose approval shall not
unreasonably be withheld), and the Indemnified Party may participate in such
defense at such party's expense, and provided further that the failure of any
Indemnified Party to give notice as provided herein shall not relieve the
Indemnifying Party of its obligations under this Section 1, to the extent such
failure is not prejudicial.  No Indemnifying Party, in the defense of any such
claim or litigation, shall, except with the consent of each Indemnified Party,
consent to entry of any judgment or enter into any settlement that does not
include as an unconditional term thereof the giving by the claimant or plaintiff
to such Indemnified Party of a release from all liability in respect to such
claim or litigation.  Each Indemnified Party shall furnish such information
regarding itself or

                                     10.
<PAGE>
 
the claim in question as an Indemnifying Party may reasonably request in writing
and as shall be reasonably required in connection with defense of such claim and
litigation resulting therefrom.

               (d)  If the indemnification provided for in this Section 1.8 is
held by a court of competent jurisdiction to be unavailable to an Indemnified
Party with respect to any loss, liability, claim, damage, or expense referred to
therein, then the Indemnifying Party, in lieu of indemnifying such Indemnified
Party hereunder, shall contribute to the amount paid or payable by such
Indemnified Party as a result of such loss, liability, claim, damage, or expense
in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect the relative fault of the
Indemnifying Party on the one hand and of the Indemnified Party on the other in
connection with the statements or omissions that resulted in such toss,
liability, claim, damage, or expense as well as any other relevant equitable
considerations.  The relative fault of the Indemnifying Party and of the
Indemnified Party shall be determined by reference to, among other things,
whether the untrue or alleged untrue statement of a material fact or the
omission to state a material fact relates to information supplied by the
Indemnifying Party or by the Indemnified Party and the parties' relative intent,
knowledge, access to information, and opportunity to correct or prevent such
statement or omission.

               (e)  Notwithstanding the foregoing, to the extent that the
provisions on indemnification and contribution contained in the underwriting
agreement entered into in connection with the underwritten public offering are
in conflict with the foregoing provisions, the provisions in the underwriting
agreement shall control.

          1.9  Information by Holder.  Each Holder of Registrable Securities
shall furnish to the Company such information regarding such Holder and the
distribution proposed by such Holder as the Company may reasonably request in
writing and as shall be reasonably required in connection with any registration,
qualification, or compliance referred to in this Section 1.

          1.10 Limitations on Subsequent Registration Rights.  From and after
the date of this Agreement, the Company shall not, without the prior written
consent of a majority in interest of the Holders, enter into any agreement with
any holder or prospective holder of any securities of the Company giving such
holder or prospective holder any registration rights the terms of which are more
favorable than the registration rights granted to the Holders hereunder.

          1.11 Rule 144 Reporting.  With a view to making available the benefits
of certain rules and regulations of the Commission that may permit the sale of
the Restricted Securities to the public without registration, the Company agrees
to use its best efforts to:

               (a)  Make and keep public information regarding the Company
available as those terms are understood and defined in Rule 144 under the
Securities Act, at all times from and after ninety (90) days following the
effective date of the first registration under the Securities Act filed by the
Company for an offering of its securities to the general public;

                                     11.
<PAGE>
 
               (b) File with the Commission in a timely manner all reports and
other documents required of the Company under the Securities Act and the
Exchange Act at any time after it has become subject to such reporting
requirements;

               (c) So long as a Holder owns any Restricted Securities, furnish
to the Holder forthwith upon written request a written statement by the
Company as to its compliance with the reporting requirements of Rule 144 (at
any time from and after ninety (90) days following the effective date of the
first registration statement filed by the Company for an offering of its
securities to the general public), and of the Securities Act and the Exchange
Act (at any time after it has become subject to such reporting requirements),
a copy, of the most recent annual or quarterly report of the Company, and such
other reports and documents so filed as a Holder may reasonably request in
availing itself of any rule or regulation of the Commission allowing a Holder
to sell any such securities without registration.

          1.12 Transfer or Assignment of Registration Rights. The rights to
cause the Company to register securities granted to a Holder by the Company
under this Section 1 may be transferred or assigned by a Holder only to a
transferee or assignee of not less than 50,000 shares of Registrable
Securities (as presently constituted and subject to subsequent adjustments for
stock splits, stock dividends, reverse stock splits, and the like), provided
that the Company is given written notice at the time of or within a reasonable
time after said transfer or assignment, stating the name and address of the
transferee or assignee and identifying the securities with respect to which
such registration rights are being transferred or assigned, and, provided
further, that the transferee or assignee of such rights assumes in writing the
obligations of such Holder under this Section 1.

          1.13 "Market Stand-Off" Agreement.  If requested by the Company and an
underwriter of Common Stock (or other securities) of the Company, a Holder shall
not sell or otherwise transfer or dispose of any Common Stock (or other
securities) of the Company held by such Holder (other than those included in the
registration) during the one hundred eighty (180) day period following the
effective date of a registration statement of the Company filed under the
Securities Act, provided that:

               (a)  such agreement shall only apply to the first such
registration statement of the Company, including securities to be sold on its
behalf to the public in an underwritten offering; and

               (b)  all Holders, Other Stockholders, officers, directors,
affiliates and any persons holding securities representing 5% or more of the
normal voting power of the Company are bound by similar agreements.

     The obligations described in this Section 1.13 shall not apply to a
registration relating solely to employee benefit plans on Form S-1 or Form S-8
or similar forms that may be promulgated in the future, or a registration
relating solely to a Commission Rule 145 transaction on Form S-4 or similar
forms that may be promulgated in the future.  The Company may

                                     12.
<PAGE>
 
impose stop-transfer instructions with respect to the shares (or securities)
subject to the foregoing restriction until the end of said one hundred eighty
(180) day period.

          1.14 Allocation of Registration Opportunities.  In any circumstance in
which all of the Registrable Securities and other shares of Common Stock of the
Company (including shares of Common Stock issued or issuable upon conversion of
shares of any currently unissued series of Preferred Stock of the Company) with
registration rights (the "Other Shares") requested to be included in a
registration on behalf of the Holders or Other Stockholders cannot be so
included as a result of limitations of the aggregate number of shares of
Registrable Securities and Other Shares that may be so included, the number of
shares of Registrable Securities and Other Shares that may be so included shall
be allocated among the Holders and Other Stockholders requesting inclusion of
shares pro rata on the basis of the number of shares of Registrable Securities
and Other Shares that would be held by such Holders and Other Stockholders,
assuming conversion; provided, however, so that such allocation shall not
operate to reduce the aggregate number of Registrable Securities and Other
Shares to be included in such registration, if any Holder or Other Stockholder
does not request inclusion of the maximum number of shares of Registrable
Securities and Other Shares allocated to such person pursuant to the above-
described procedure, the remaining portion of such person's allocation shall be
reallocated among those requesting Holders and Other Stockholders whose
allocations did not satisfy their requests pro rata on the basis of the number
of shares of Registrable Securities and Other Shares which would be held by such
Holders and Other Stockholders, assuming conversion, and this procedure shall be
repeated until all of the shares of Registrable Securities and Other Shares
which may be included in the registration on behalf of the Holders and Other
Stockholders have been so allocated.  The Company shall not limit the number of
Registrable Securities to be included in a registration pursuant to this
Agreement in order to include shares held by stockholders with no registration
rights or to include founder's stock or any other shares of stock issued to
employees, officers, directors, or consultants by the Company.

          1.15 Delay of Registration.  No Holder shall have any right to take
any action to restrain, enjoin, or otherwise delay any registration as the
result of any controversy that might arise with respect to the interpretation or
implementation of this Section 1.

          1.16 Termination of Registration Rights.  The registration rights
granted to the Holders under this Section 1 shall terminate upon the expiration
of five years after the closing of the first registered firmly underwritten
public offering of Common Stock of the Company.

     2.   MISCELLANEOUS.

          2.1  Governing Law.  This Agreement shall be governed in all respects
by the laws of the State of Delaware.

          2.2  Successors and Assigns.  Except as otherwise expressly provided
herein, the provisions hereof shall inure to the benefit of, and be binding
upon, the successors, assigns, heirs, executors and administrators of the
parties hereto.

          2.3  Entire Agreement; Amendment; Waiver.  This Agreement (including
the Exhibits hereto) constitutes the full and entire understanding and agreement
between the parties with regard to the subjects hereof and thereof.  Neither
this Agreement nor any term hereof may be amended, waived, discharged or
terminated, except by a written instrument signed by the Company and the Holders
of at least fifty percent (50%) of the Registrable Securities and any such
amendment, waiver, discharge or termination shall be binding on all the Holders,
but in no event shall the obligation of any Holder hereunder be materially
increased, except upon the written consent of such Holder.

          2.4  Notices, Etc.  All notices and other communications required or
permitted hereunder shall be in writing and shall be mailed by United States
first-class mail, postage prepaid, sent by facsimile or delivered personally by
hand or nationally recognized courier addressed (a) if to a Holder, as indicated
on the signature page hereto, or at such other address or facsimile number as
such Holder or a permitted assignee shall have furnished to the Company in
writing, or (b) if to the Company, at the address or facsimile number on the
signature page hereto, or to such other address or facsimile number as the
Company shall have furnished to each Holder in writing. All such notices and
other written communications shall be effective on the date of mailing,
facsimile transfer or delivery.

          2.5  Delays or Omissions.  No delay or omission to exercise any right,
power or remedy accruing to any Holder, upon any breach or default of the
Company under this Agreement shall impair any such right, power or remedy of
such Holder nor shall it be construed to be a waiver of any such breach or
default, or an acquiescence therein, or of or in any similar breach or default
thereafter occurring; nor shall any waiver of any single breach or default be
deemed a waiver of any other breach or default therefore or thereafter
occurring.  Any waiver, permit, consent or approval of any kind or character on
the part of any Holder of any breach or default under this Agreement or any
waiver on the part of any Holder of any provisions or conditions of this
Agreement must be made in writing and shall be effective only to the extent
specifically set forth in such writing.  All remedies, either under this
Agreement or by law or otherwise afforded to any Holder, shall be cumulative and
not alternative.

          2.6  Rights; Separability.  Unless otherwise expressly provided
herein, a Holder's rights hereunder are several rights, not rights jointly held
with any of the other Holders.  In case any provision of the Agreement shall be
invalid, illegal or unenforceable, the validity, legality and enforceability of
the remaining provisions shall not in any way be affected or impaired thereby.

          2.7  Information Confidential.  Each Holder acknowledges that the
information received by such Holder pursuant hereto may be confidential and for
its use only, and it will not use such confidential information in violation of
the Exchange Act or reproduce, disclose or disseminate such information to any
other person (other than its employees or agents having a need to know the
contents of such information, and its attorneys), except in connection with the
exercise of rights under this Agreement, unless the Company has made such
information available to the public generally or such Holder is required to
disclose such information by a governmental body.

                                   AGREEMENT



     THIS AGREEMENT is entered into as of the 21st day of December 1993, (the
"Effective Date") by and between US Order, Inc., a Delaware corporation
("Licensor") and VeriFone, Inc., a Delaware ("Licensee").


                                    RECITALS

     WHEREAS, Licensor has developed and owns or has the license to use all
intellectual property rights of Licensor, including without limitation all
patent, copyright, trademark, trade secret and any other intellectual property
rights held by Licensor in any jurisdiction in connection with its current
application and operating system software for both front-end terminal devices as
well as the back-end host and any communications in-between, as set forth in
Exhibit A as attached hereto, together with all updates and derivative works,
developed for or on behalf of Licensor (including all source code and all
relevant documentation therefor) (the "Licensed Technology"); and

     WHEREAS,  the parties hereto have agreed to enter into a Stock Purchase
Agreement (the "Stock Purchase Agreement"), a Registration Rights Agreement (the
"Registration Rights Agreement"), and an Investment Agreement (the "Investment
Agreement"), all of even date herewith; and

     WHEREAS, as partial consideration to induce Licensee to enter into such
Agreements, Licensor desires to grant to Licensee and Licensee desires to accept
from Licensor, a fully-paid, non-exclusive, world-wide license to practice the
Licensed Technology in order to develop, make, have made, use and sell products
and derivative works incorporating such Licensed Technology, the use of which is
triggered by a Triggering Event (as defined below) during the term of this
Agreement and in accordance with the terms hereinafter specified.

     NOW THEREFORE, in consideration of the foregoing and the covenants and
premises contained in this Agreement, the parties agree as follows:


                                   ARTICLE 1

                                    LICENSE

     1.1  License Grant.  Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement,
including without limitation Articles 2 and 4 hereof, Licensor hereby grants to
Licensee during the term of this Agreement a fully-paid, non-exclusive, world-
wide license to reproduce, prepare derivative works, distribute, perform and
display the Licensed Technology and to practice the

                                       1.
<PAGE>
 
Licensed Technology in order to develop, make, have made, use and sell products
and derivative works incorporating such Licensed Technology (the "Licensed
Rights").

     1.2  Sublicenses.  Licensee shall have the right to grant written
sublicenses consistent with the terms of this Agreement after the occurrence of
a Triggering Event (as defined below) and upon the written agreement of the
sublicensee to abide by the terms of this Agreement.

                                   ARTICLE 2

                     LIMITATIONS ON USE OF LICENSED RIGHTS

     2.1  Licensee's Use of Licensed Rights.  Licensee hereby agrees that,
notwithstanding the present license grant set forth in Section 1.1 hereof, it
shall refrain from using the Licensed Rights in any way and shall keep all
Licensed Technology in the manner set forth in Section 2.2 hereof unless and
until one of the Triggering Events occurs.  As used herein, a "Triggering Event"
shall mean (a) a general assignment for the benefit of creditors, or filing of
any petition in bankruptcy or for relief under the Title 11 of the United States
Code of, by or against Licensor; or (b) Licensor breaches or defaults upon any
of its material obligations hereunder and such breach or default is not cured
within twenty (20) days of notice thereof.  Upon the occurrence of a Triggering
Event, all restrictions with respect to Licensee's use of the Licensed Rights
shall automatically cease without further action required on any party's part.

     2.2  Licensed Technology Package.

          (a) Upon execution of this Agreement, Licensor shall deliver to
Licensee a technical data package consisting of the Licensed Technology,
including without limitation all source code and documentation for the
Licensed Technology and in such detail that a person skilled in the field can
use, modify or reproduce the Licensed Technology (the "Licensed Technology
Package"). The Licensed Technology Package shall also include a detailed table
of contents and an officer's certificate executed by either the Chief
Executive Officer or the President and by the Chief Technical Officer of
Licensor (an "Officers' Certificate") to the effect that they have personally
inspected the Licensed Technology Package and that the Licensed Technology
Package contains all materials required to be delivered pursuant to this
Agreement.

          (b) Licensee shall place the Licensed Technology Package in secure
storage and shall not use it except as permitted by this Agreement. If
Licensor so requests, the Licensed Technology Package shall be sealed by
Licensor in the presence of a representative of Licensor. Licensor shall have
the right, at any time during the term hereof prior to the occurrence of one
of the Triggering Events, to inspect the Licensed Technology Package during
normal business hours at the Licensee facility where it is kept, to determine
that the seal has not been broken. Such inspections shall not occur more
frequently than once in each calendar quarter.

          (c) Licensor shall provide Licensee not less than once per calendar
quarter, with an update to the Licensed Technology Package containing any and
all updates, changes, fixes and derivatives to the Licensed Technology not
previously deposited in the Licensed Technology Package. If there are no such
changes or updates to the Licensed Technology

                                       2.
<PAGE>
 
during a calendar quarter, Licensor shall furnish an Officers' Certificate to
Licensee certifying that there have been no such changes, updates or
modifications to the Licensed Technology.   Any failure to provide updates
hereunder after notice thereof shall be considered a default under this
Agreement.

          (d) The procedures set forth in subsections 2.2(a) and (b) shall
also apply to each update delivered pursuant to subsection 2.2(c).

          (e) Licensee agrees to give Licensor one (1) full business day's
notice before unsealing any sealed Licensed Technology Package pursuant to
this Agreement. Licensor agrees to give Licensee immediate notice of the
happening of any event described in clause (a) of subsection 2.1 hereof.

     2.3  License Rights in the Event of Licensor Bankruptcy.  In the event that
Licensor or its successors or representatives reject or seek to terminate this
Agreement in breach of the provisions hereof, including as contemplated under
Section 365 of the Bankruptcy Code, it is acknowledged that this Agreement
contemplates the manner in which Licensee may retain its rights in the Licensed
Technology, including any other intellectual property rights which may be
associated therewith, if Licensee chooses to do so in accordance with Section
365(n) of the Bankruptcy Code.  It is the parties' intent that the rights
Licensee shall be entitled to retain shall be of the scope provided in Section
1.1 hereof in all items delivered or required to be delivered under the
Agreement.

                                   ARTICLE 3

                        OWNERSHIP; INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY

     3.1  Ownership.  Licensee acknowledges and agrees that Licensor is and
shall remain the sole owner of the Licensed Technology and that Licensee has no
rights in or to the Licensed Technology other than the license rights
specifically granted herein.

     3.2  Future Inventions and Joint Inventions.  Each party acknowledges and
agrees that any and all discoveries, know-how, inventions, methods, ideas and
the like ("Inventions") made or discovered pursuant to this Agreement solely by
its employees shall be owned solely by it and that any and all Inventions made
jointly by employees of each shall be jointly owned ("Joint Inventions"), all as
determined in accordance with U.S. laws of inventorship.  Any modifications made
to the Licensed Technology by Licensee hereunder shall be the property of
Licensee, and Licensee shall own all right, title and interest in such
modifications.

                                   ARTICLE 4

                                      TERM

     4.1  Term.  This Agreement will commence as of the Effective Date of this
Agreement and, unless sooner terminated as provided hereunder, will terminate
upon the earlier of the third anniversary date of the Effective Date or the
successful completion by Licensor of

                                       3.
<PAGE>
 
a firmly underwritten public offering managed by underwriters of recognized
national standing with gross proceeds to Licensor equal to or in excess of
$7,500,000.

     4.2  Effect of Expiration of Agreement.  Upon expiration of this Agreement,
the Licensed Technology Package shall be returned to Licensor.  If no Triggering
Event occurred during the term of the Agreement, Licensee shall supply an
officer's certificate certifying that Licensee did not break the seal of the
Licensed Technology Package.

                                   ARTICLE 5

          (c) The execution and delivery by Licensor of this Agreement and all
documents to be executed by Licensor in connection with the transactions
contemplated hereby do not, and the performance and consummation by Licensor
of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement will not, result in any
conflict with, breach or violation of or default, termination, forfeiture or
lien under (or upon the failure to give notice or the lapse of time, or both,
result in any conflict with, breach or violation of or default, termination,
forfeiture or lien under) any terms or provisions of Licensor's Certificate of
Incorporation or Bylaws, each as amended, or any statute, rule, regulation,
judicial or governmental decree, order or judgment, agreement, lease or other
instrument to which Licensor is a party or to which it or its assets are

or non-performance of any law, contract, note, debt instrument, security
agreement or mortgage, or any other commitment binding upon Licensor or any of
the Licensed Technology, without loss or diminution of benefit and use of any
Licensed Technology.  Not included within the meaning of "Licensed Technology"
for purposes of this representation and warranty is any generally available
software licensed by Licensor from a third party subject to restrictions
prohibiting the transfer of Licensor's license to Licensee.

          (e) No consent, approval, authorization, order, registration,
qualification or filing of or with any court or any regulatory authority or
any other governmental body, where failure to obtain such consent, approval,
authorization, order, registration, qualification or filing has or will have a
material adverse effect on the use of the Licensed Technology, is required for
the consummation by Licensor of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement.

          (f) This Agreement and each document to be executed by Licensor in
connection with the transactions contemplated hereby is, and upon due
execution and delivery by the parties thereto will be, a legal, valid and
binding obligation of Licensor, enforceable against Licensor in accordance

patent applications with respect to the Licensed Technology, or (ii) any
registered trademarks, trade names, service marks, or the like, or applications
therefor.

          (b)  Except as specifically disclosed in the Stock Purchase Agreement,
no licenses, sub-licenses or other agreements relating to any of the Licensed
Technology exist which would limit or restrict the rights of Licensee to use the
Licensed Rights or which grant to a third party any rights in any of the
Licensed Technology.

defend Licensee, its agents, directors, officers, employees and consultants
against any and all claims, suits, losses, damages, costs, fees and expenses

equipment, device or data, if such other products, software, technology or

customers, if such infringement charge would have been avoided in the absence of
such combination or alteration.

effective upon the condition that (1) Licensee gives Licensor prompt written
notice of any such claim or action or Licensor is not prejudiced by any delay in

in the investigation and defense of such claim or action.

between US Order as Licensor and VeriFone as Licensee dated the date hereof and

(the "First Closing"), obtain a written release of such security interest from
the holder(s) thereof.

          (b)  VeriFone hereby agrees to indemnify and hold US Order harmless

attorneys' fees, by reason of its breach hereof.

time a representative (with an alternate) to attend all meetings of the Board of

telephone, in a nonvoting observer capacity; to receive notice of all such
meetings and to receive any written consents circulated for signature by
directors; and to receive all information provided to the Board of Directors and
any committee thereof, all on the same basis as if such representative were a
director; provided, however:

          (a)  US Order reserves the right to exclude the VeriFone
representative from the portion of any meeting (and to withhold any specifically
related information) which covers any matter between US Order and VeriFone; and

          (b)  VeriFone shall hold in confidence and trust the information
received in connection with its Board observer rights to the same extent as any

<PAGE>
 
4.   Right of First Refusal With Respect to Future Products

     US Order hereby agrees that, with respect to any application developed by
or for US Order that requires a terminal or other hardware in addition to, or in
lieu of, PhonePlus (such terminal or other hardware, plus any firmware or
software therefor requested by US Order, being referred to as a "Future Product"
herein), VeriFone shall have a right of first refusal to develop (at VeriFone's
expense) and supply US Order on an exclusive basis with such Future Product.
Upon US Order's commitment to commercial development of any such application, US
Order will give VeriFone written notice of its need for any Future Product with
respect thereto, including all related requirements and specifications.  If
VeriFone proposes to develop such Future Product and to sell it to US Order on
terms that meet US Order's requirements as to price, features, quality, delivery
and support, US Order shall enter into a mutually satisfactory OEM purchase
agreement with VeriFone so that VeriFone may develop and produce the Future
Product and sell it to US Order.  If VeriFone proposes to commercially develop
and produce the Future Product, but US Order determines that VeriFone has not
met its requirements and specifications, US Order shall be free to obtain the
Future Product elsewhere, but not on requirements or specifications more
favorable to the proposed producer thereof than those utilized with respect to
VeriFone.  Once VeriFone has obtained the exclusive right to commercially
develop and produce a Future Product and sell it to US Order hereunder, VeriFone
agrees to use reasonable efforts to reduce the cost of the Future Product, so
that VeriFone will be in a position to reduce the prices it charges US Order for
purchases of the Future Product.

5.   Recurring Revenue Opportunities

     US Order agrees to meet with representatives of VeriFone and explore
mutually acceptable ways in which VeriFone could sell VeriFone products or
provide services to US Order, US Order's customers and/or the providers of
services on US Order's systems on a basis that provides VeriFone with revenue on
a periodic, per unit, per transaction, per occurrence or other recurring basis.
US Order and VeriFone will use their best efforts to reach agreement on
potential opportunities as soon as reasonably practical.

6.   US Order Indebtedness to WorldCorp

     (a)  US Order and WorldCorp hereby represent and warrant to VeriFone that
the only indebtedness outstanding from US Order to WorldCorp, other than (i) not
more than $1,000,000 in demand indebtedness incurred by US Order as bridge
financing until the First Closing can be completed, which bridge financing will
be repaid out of the proceeds of the sale of Series C Preferred Stock at the
First Closing and (ii) not more than $300,000 through intercompany accounts, is
$3,500,000 in aggregate principal amount under that certain Increasing Rate Note
dated May 1, 1993, in the original principal amount of $4,500,000 (the "Note"),
issued pursuant to that certain Loan Agreement between WorldCorp and US Order

                              Settlement Agreement
                              --------------------

     This Settlement Agreement dated as of this 3rd day of February, 1994, among
Concord Asset Management, Inc. ("Concord"), Concord Leasing, Inc. ("Concord
Leasing"), The CIT Group/Equipment Financing, Inc. ("CIT"), World Airways, Inc.
("World Airways"), and WorldCorp, Inc. ("WorldCorp") (World Airways and
WorldCorp sometimes being referred to hereinafter collectively as "World").

     WHEREAS, the parties to this agreement are engaged in a litigation entitled
Concord Asset Management, Inc., et al., v. The CIT/Group Equipment Financing,
Inc. et al., Index No. 133604-93 and are desirous of settling all claims and
counterclaims asserted or that might have been asserted arising out of the
subject matter of such action;

     NOW THEREFORE, in consideration of the covenants and consideration set
forth below, the parties agree as follows:

     1. CIT irrevocably waives any and all claims against Concord Leasing under
the Guaranty Agreement between CIT and Concord Leasing dated as of June 4, 1992.

     2. CIT irrevocably waives any and all claims under the Agreement of
Subordination and Priorities entered into among Aircraft 46891, Inc., CIT, and
Concord, dated as of June 4, 1992, with respect to any consideration being
delivered to Concord from World under the terms of this Agreement.

     3. In the event of a sale or a binding contract of sale of the Aircraft
(as defined below) within two years following February 8th, 1994, CIT agrees
to share with Concord 50 / 50 any proceeds from such sale to the extent that
such proceeds exceed the sum of the outstanding loan balance on CIT's senior
loan (including but not limited to interest, expense of repossession and
foreclosure, attorneys fees in connection with the foregoing and with this
lawsuit, and other amounts owed and/or secured under the loan documents) and
all expenses incurred in marketing, storing, insuring, managing, repairing,
overhauling or improving the Aircraft. CIT has complete discretion as to
whether or not to sell and at what price to sell the Aircraft during such two
year period. CIT also has complete discretion as to the manner of any such
sale without regard to the UCC requirement of commercial reasonableness.
"Aircraft" shall mean that certain McDonnell Douglas Model DC-10-3OCF aircraft
bearing manufacturer's serial number 46891 and FAA Registration Number Nl05WA
(the "Airframe") and the three (3) General Electric Model CF6 50C2 engines,
bearing Manufacturer's Serial Nos. 517316, 517218 and 455196, respectively
(the "Engines"), together with all avionics, appliances, parts, instruments,
appurtenances, accessories, furnishings, relating
<PAGE>
 
thereto and other equipment of whatever nature installed on or attached to the
Airframe, or Engines, or forming a part thereof (hereinafter referred to as the
"Parts"), together with all manuals or data and records relating to the
Airframe, Engines and Parts.

     4. Subject to the Letter Agreement dated October 19, 1993 between CIT and
World (the "Letter Agreement"), CIT agrees that all maintenance reserves held by
CIT will be either invested in the Aircraft or applied to the balance on CIT's
senior loan, at CIT's discretion.

     5. World agrees to pay $1.75 million to Concord at the time of the
foreclosure sale, or if there is no foreclosure sale, as of the date of the
transfer of title to the Aircraft pursuant to this agreement; such payment shall
be made in the form of immediately available funds by wire transfer to an
account designated by Concord.

     6. WorldCorp will deliver to Concord a note in the form annexed hereto as
Exhibit A on or before February 8, 1994.

     7. For the purposes of the foreclosure sale or other transfer of title to
the Collateral (as such term is defined in the aircraft mortgage between
Aircraft 46891, Inc. and CIT, dated June 22, 1992), the Collateral will be
divided into two lots: (1) the Contract Rights Collateral, to consist of the
Lease and the WorldCorp Guaranty (as such terms are defined in such mortgage),
and (2) the Aircraft Collateral, consisting of the Aircraft and the Reserves
Agreement including cash held pursuant thereto (as such terms are defined in
said mortgage). CIT and Concord will use their best efforts to obtain from
Aircraft 46891, Inc. a bill of sale or similar instrument in lieu of foreclosure
as to such all such Collateral, effective on or before February 8th, 1994. To
the extent that it proves impossible to obtain a bill of sale or similar
instrument in lieu of foreclosure with respect to either or both of the Aircraft
Collateral and the Contract Rights Collateral on or before February 8th, 1994, a
foreclosure sale will be held on that date as follows:

     (a) The Aircraft Collateral will be sold first and CIT will bid in the
     entire balance of its senior loan.

     (b) Thereafter, Concord will conduct a foreclosure sale of the Contract
     Rights Collateral and will bid in for such Contract Rights Collateral up
     to the amount of the entire balance of its subordinate loan.

     (c) Concurrently with the foreclosure sale, Concord will receive the
     consideration described above.

     (d) Concord, Concord Leasing, World and Winthrop, Stimson, Putnam &
     Roberts, as escrow agent, will enter into an agreement concerning the
     delivery of mutual releases and forbearance of enforcement action in the
<PAGE>
 
form annexed hereto as Exhibit B. Such release shall be delivered to World at
any time commencing 91 days after the date of the foreclosure sale or other
transfer of title to the Collateral upon receipt by the escrowee of a
certificate signed by an officer of World Airways and WorldCorp, certifying that
as of the date of the certificate, which shall be not less than 91 days after
the date of the foreclosure sale or other transfer of the title to the
Collateral, no case under the Bankruptcy Code is pending with respect to World
Airways or WorldCorp.

     (e) The foreclosure sale, if necessary, shall be held on February 8, 1994
     at 11:00 a.m. at the office of Schulte, Roth & Zabel, 900 Third Avenue, New
     York, New York.

     (f) No further notice of such foreclosure sale need be given.

     Notwithstanding anything set forth above, the sale of the Collateral in two
lots is not intended to mean, nor does it imply that such mode of sale is
commercially reasonable. The sale in two lots is for settlement purposes only,
and no meaning or import should or may attach to the method of sale of the
Collateral.

     8. On February 8, 1994, the parties shall exchange releases in the form
annexed hereto as Exhibit C, except that the mutual release of Concord, Concord
Leasing and World shall be delivered in escrow as provided above.

     9. The parties waive any claim that the foreclosure sale as described above
is not commercially reasonable.

     10. The parties agree to the entry of a default judgment against Aircraft
46891, Inc., the owner of the Aircraft and a defendant on the counterclaim
herein.

     11. At the time of the foreclosure sale or other transfer of title to the
Collateral CIT will pay to World an amount equal to $2,171,397.66 as provided in
Paragraph 5 of the Letter Agreement and an amount equal to $381,873.43 to
Caledonian Airmotive Ltd.

     12. Concord and CIT will execute such releases against the Collateral as
are necessary or advisable to effectuate the transactions contemplated hereby.
World will execute such documents as are necessary or advisable to release liens
relating to the Lease and the Aircraft at the Federal Aviation Administration.
The parties give further assurances to turn over and/or execute such documents
as may be necessary or reasonably requested to effectuate this settlement and
the transactions contemplated hereby.
<PAGE>
 
     13. The parties agree not to commence or continue judicial proceedings with
respect to the subject matter of this action, other than to enforce the terms of
this agreement.

     14. CIT and World agree that the Letter Agreement is deemed modified in
accordance with the terms of this agreement.

     15. This agreement may be signed in counterparts, which together shall
constitute one instrument.

     16. It is understood that World may deliver on February 8, 1994 facsimile
signatures on this Agreement, the Note referred to paragraph 6 and the releases
referred to in paragraph 7(d) and paragraph 8 above. If World delivers such
facsimile signatures on February 8, then Concord's and Concord Leasing's and
CIT's releases in favor of World shall be held in escrow by their respective
counsel pending receipt by such counsel within 10 days of original signature
pages of this Agreement and of the aforesaid releases signed on behalf of World,
and an original executed Note.

real estate taxes and assessments in the name of the Landlord or the Tenant,
as required, by appropriate proceedings diligently conducted in good faith and
the Landlord agrees to fully cooperate in any such efforts by the Tenant, at
the expense of Tenant. If the payment of the tax or assessment would operate
as a bar to the proceedings or to materially interfere with its prosecution,
the Tenant may require the Landlord to postpone or to defer the payment of the
tax (and

or violation of any mortgage. Any interest or penalty incurred by reason of the
postponement of the payment of the taxes shall be paid by the Tenant.

increased assessment or tax, if any, resulting from leasehold improvements
made by Tenant.

adjusted and pro-rated to the termination date.

          (b) Tenant shall pay its share of such increase in insurance
premiums as set forth above within thirty (30) days following receipt from the
Landlord of a statement of its calculations supported by copies of the actual
billings rendered to Landlord.

          (c) The fire and extended coverage policy shall expressly waive any
right of subrogation against Landlord or Tenant.

          (d) Notwithstanding the generality of the foregoing, in the event
Tenant's improvements to or occupancy or use of the Premises causes any
increase in premiums for fire and extended coverage insurance on the
Improvements of which the Premises are a part above the rate established for
other uses in the Improvements, the Tenant shall pay the entire additional
premiums resulting therefrom. Bills for such additional premiums shall be
rendered by Landlord to Tenant at such times as Landlord may elect and shall
be due from and payable by Tenant when rendered, and shall constitute
additional rent.

8. UTILITIES:
   --------- 

     Tenant shall pay all charges for gas, electricity, light, heat, all public
charges for sanitary sewage discharged from the Premises and for water consumed
on the Premises, power and all other utilities and telephone or other
communication services used, rendered or supplied upon or in connection with the
Premises. Tenant shall pay its pro-rata share of trash removal service for the
building, if any are arranged by Landlord.

9. LIENS OR ENCUMBRANCES:
   --------------------- 

     Tenant shall not suffer the Premises or any erection of improvements
thereon to become subject to any lien, charge or encumbrances, and shall
indemnify Landlord against all such liens, charges and encumbrances.

    --------------- 
     Tenant shall use and occupy the premises throughout the term hereof solely
for the purposes of operating a warehouse and for office facilities used in
connection therewith.

11. ALTERATIONS AND IMPROVEMENTS:
    ---------------------------- 

     Tenant shall at no time or times make any alterations, improvements or
changes of any kind to the Premises without first submitting the plans and
specifications thereof and securing the written consent or unwritten lack of
objection of the Landlord, which consent or lack of objection shall not be
unreasonably withheld; provided, however, that Tenant may, at its own option and
without having to secure the consent or lack of objection, written or otherwise
of the Landlord, make any alterations or changes of any kind to the Premises
which may be required by any governmental order or regulation, and, so long as
such alterations or changes are not of a character required to be performed by
Landlord hereunder, such alterations or changes shall, if made by Tenant, be
made at no expense to Landlord. All improvements, alterations, replacements and
building service equipment made or installed by or on behalf of Tenant and
permanently affixed to the Improvements shall immediately upon completion or
installment thereof be and become the property of Landlord without payment
therefor by Landlord, but subject to the provisions of this Lease; provided that
all machinery, equipment (other than building service equipment), trade
fixtures, movable partitions, furniture and furnishings installed by Tenant or
maintained on the Premises, even if permanently affixed thereto, shall remain
the property of Tenant, and Tenant shall, if not in default, be entitled to
remove the same or any part thereof at any time during the Lease term but Tenant
shall, at its expense, repair any and all damage to the Premises resulting from
or caused by such removal. The interest of Tenant in any property which is not
so removed shall at the end of the time provided, for removal thereof vest in
Landlord. Landlord shall not be required to give written consent to any work or
alternatives proposed by Tenant, but the absence of Landlord's objection, if
none is expressed in writing by Landlord within thirty (30) days of Landlord's
receipt of Tenant's plans and specifications, shall be deemed lack of objection
for purposes of this Lease. No lack of objection by Landlord, and nothing set
forth in this Lease relating to work to be done by Tenant, shall constitute
Landlord's consent that any such work be done on the credit of Landlord or the
premises, land, structure or any part thereof; but any such work, and all labor
done or materials supplied, shall be done solely on the credit of Tenant and its
leasehold interest only.

12. REPAIRS AND MAINTENANCE:
    ----------------------- 

     A. Tenant covenants throughout the term, at its expense, to maintain in
good order and repair the interior structure, surfaces, components, systems and
equipment of the Premises, and to maintain and replace when necessary, all
windows and door glass therein, interior and exterior, to maintain and repair
but not replace except as hereinafter set forth all building service equipment
therein including, but not limited to, electrical, plumbing, heating, air
conditioning and sprinkler equipment, pipes, wires, ducts, fixtures and
appliances; to make all ordinary and necessary repairs; to keep the Premises in
a safe, clean and sanitary condition; to provide for the removal of trash and
rubbish; and to surrender the Premises at the end of the term in as good
condition as when received except for ordinary wear and use, and except for fire
or other unavoidable casualty not caused by Tenant, its employees, agents or
invitees (or if so caused, as to which Landlord receives adequate insurance
proceeds).

     B. Landlord agrees to perform at its expense, maintenance and repairs to
the exterior structure of the building and roof except when repairs are
necessitated by the negligence or other act or omission of Tenant, its
employees, agents or invitees other than normal use and ordinary wear and tear.

                                       4

13. LIABILITY INSURANCE:
    ------------------- 

     Tenant shall obtain and maintain public liability insurance in form and
substance satisfactory to Landlord and Landlord's lender, insuring Landlord
against claims for bodily injury or death occurring in or about the Premises and
on, in or about the adjoining driveways, parking areas, walks and passageways,
to the limit of not less than Five Hundred Thousand Dollars ($500,000.00) in
respect of bodily injury or death to one person, and to the limit of not less
than One Million Dollars ($1,000,000.00) in respect of one occurrence, and
property damage insurance insuring against claims for damage or injury to
property of others occurring in or about the Premises and on, in or about the
adjoining streets and passageways, to the limit of not less than One Hundred
Thousand Dollars ($100,000.00) in respect to damage to the property of another.

     Said policy shall provide that notwithstanding any act or omission of
Tenant which might otherwise result in its forfeiture, the policy shall not be
cancelled without at least ten (10) days written notice to each named insured,
including mortgagees.

14. DAMAGE OR DESTRUCTION:
    --------------------- 

     A. If during the term the Premises are damaged by fire or other casualty,
but not to the extent that Tenant is prevented from carrying on its business in
the Premises, Landlord shall promptly restore the Premises to their condition
immediately prior to the casualty, insofar as recovered insurance proceeds in
hand permit; provided, however, that if such damage has not been caused by
Tenant, its agents, employees or invitees, and is not restored within one
hundred twenty (120) days, Tenant may terminate this Lease, on thirty (30) days
written notice unless such restoration is substantially completed within such
thirty (30) days.

     B. If during the term the Premises are destroyed or so damaged by fire or
other casualty that Tenant is prevented from carrying on business in the
Premises and Tenant and Landlord cannot agree upon mutually acceptable outline
provisions with respect to restoration within (30) days of the casualty,
Landlord shall have option either to restore the Premises to their condition
immediately prior to the casualty or to terminate the Lease. Such option shall
be exercised by Landlord by written notice to the Tenant within forty-five (45)
days after the casualty.

     If Landlord chooses to restore the Premises, it shall prepare or cause to
be prepared a reasonable estimate of the time needed to restore the Premises to
their condition immediately prior to the casualty. Such estimate shall accompany
the written notice to Tenant. If the time period indicated in the notice exceeds
one hundred twenty (120) days, Tenant may rescind or terminate this Agreement
within five (5) days of receipt of Landlord's notice. If the restoration period
is less than the period indicated above or if Tenant agrees to a period in
excess of one hundred twenty (120) days, then Landlord shall promptly commence
such repair work. If the restoration is not completed within the time period
noted in the estimate plus thirty (30) days, Tenant may at any time thereafter
terminate this Lease, unless the restoration is substantially completed before
Tenant gives written notice of its election to terminate.

     Tenant shall not be required to pay rent for any period that the Premises
are destroyed or damaged to the extent that Tenant is substantially prevented
from carrying on its business in the Premises, unless Tenant, its employees,
agents or invitees caused such destruction or damage.

15. COMPLIANCE WITH REGULATIONS, ETC.:
    ---------------------------       

     Tenant covenants throughout the term at its expense to comply promptly with
all laws, codes, ordinances, administrative and court orders and directives,
rules and regulations which have the force of law, whether now in effect or
hereafter promulgated, applicable to Tenant's use and occupancy of the Premises,
however Tenant shall have the right to contest the applicability and/or validity
of any of the above so long as by reason of such action, the Premises or the
Improvements would not be in danger of lien, forfeiture or less, or violation of
any mortgage. All construction undertaken by Landlord pursuant to this Lease
shall likewise comply with all provisions of a like nature.

16. CONDEMNATION:
    ------------ 

     A. If during the term of this Lease, all or a substantial part of the
Premises shall be taken by eminent domain, then at the option of the Tenant or
the Landlord the Lease shall terminate as of, and the rent shall be apportioned
to and abate from and after, the date of taking, and Tenant shall have no right
to participate in any award or damages for such taking (except as set forth in
subparagraph D hereof) and hereby assigns all of its right, title and interest
therein to Landlord. For purposes of this paragraph 16, "a substantial part of
the Premises" shall mean a taking of 20% or more of the portion of the
Improvements leased hereunder.

     B. If during the term of this Lease, less than a substantial part of the
Premises (as hereinbefore defined) shall be taken by eminent domain, this Lease
shall remain in full force and effect according to its terms; and Tenant shall
have no right to participate in any award or damages for such taking and hereby
assigns all of its right, title and interest therein to Landlord, provided that
Landlord shall at its expense promptly make such repairs and improvements as
shall be necessary to restore the Premises to substantially the same efficiency
as before the taking.

     C. For the purpose of this paragraph 16, "taken by eminent domain" or
"taking under the power of eminent domain" shall include a negotiated sale or
lease and transfer of possession to a condemning authority under bona fide
                                                                 ---------
threat of condemnation for public use, and Landlord alone shall have the right
to negotiate with the condemning authority and conduct and settle all
litigation connected with the condemnation. As hereinabove used, the words
"award of damage" shall, in the event of such sale or settlement, include the
purchase or settlement price of any such negotiated transfer.

     D. Nothing herein shall be deemed to prevent Tenant from claiming,
negotiating, and receiving from the condemning authority, if legally payable,
compensation for the taking of Tenant's own tangible property, improvements upon
the leased Premises constructed at Tenant's sole expense, and damages for
Tenant's loss of business, business interruption and/or removal and relocation;
provided, however, that in no event shall Landlord receive less as a result
thereof, than if Tenant had not leased the premises. Should the condemnation be
effected without a cancellation of the Lease, there shall be an appropriate
reduction in rental commensurate with the area so taken, provided Landlord
receives compensation therefor as part of the condemnation award.

17. LANDLORD'S RIGHT TO PERFORM TENANT'S COVENANTS:
    ---------------------------------------------- 

     If Tenant shall fail to perform any covenant or duty required of it by this
Lease or by law, Landlord shall, after notice to Tenant and expiration of the
applicable cure period, have the right (but not the duty) to enter the Premises,
if necessary, to perform the same without notice, but the reasonable cost
thereof shall be deemed to be additional rent, and Landlord shall have the

                                       6
<PAGE>
 
same rights and remedies as though the additional rent were part of the monthly
rent due the Landlord under this Lease.

18. INDEMNIFICATION OF LANDLORD:
    --------------------------- 

     Except with respect to claims arising from Landlord's negligence or that of
its agents, servants or employees, Tenant covenants to indemnify and save
Landlord harmless (to the extent not reimbursed by insurance required by this
Lease to be furnished by Tenant) from any and all claims for liability of any
nature whatever arising from any use, occupancy, construction, repairs, or other
work or activity done in, on or about the Premises during the term or from any
condition of the Premises or anything thereon or therein during the term, or
from any occurrence whatever in, on or about the Premises during the term,
including all Landlord's reasonable costs, expenses and counsel fees in
connection with any such claim.

19. LANDLORD'S EXONERATION:
    ---------------------- 

     Except with respect to claims arising from Landlord's negligence or that of
its agents, servants or employees, or from Landlord's failure to make repairs
required of it to be made pursuant to this Lease (and then only if such failure
continues after notice from Tenant to Landlord and expiration of the applicable
cure period), Tenant covenants to defend, save harmless, protect and indemnify
the Landlord from and against any and all losses, damages, claims, suits or
actions judgments and costs, which may arise or grow out of any injury to or
death of any person or damage to any property (including, but not by way of
limitation, Tenant and employees, agents, or invitees of Tenant and their
property) which is caused by or results from, any occurrence, event,
circumstance or condition in or upon the Premises or in the use and possession
of the Premises and the equipment thereon by Tenant or the operation of the
business conducted by Tenant on the said Premises.

20. DEFAULT PROVISIONS:
    ------------------ 

     In the event of any default of Tenant hereinafter mentioned in this
paragraph 20, Landlord may elect to terminate this Lease by serving a written
notice upon Tenant of Landlord's election to terminate this Lease upon a
specified date, not less than thirty (30) days after the date of serving of
such notice, or any longer applicable cure period. If said default shall not
be corrected within the applicable cure period, this Lease shall then expire
on the date specified, as if that date had been originally fixed as the
expiration of the term hereinafter granted; provided, however, that this Lease
shall not terminate or expire if Tenant cures its default within the
applicable cure period.

     Each of the following events shall be deemed an event of default by Tenant
within the meaning of this paragraph 20: (a) the failure to pay any installment
of Basic Rental or additional rent when due and payable, for which the
applicable cure period is ten (10) days; (b) the failure to perform any of the
other covenants or conditions of this Lease on the part of Tenant to be
performed, for which the applicable cure period is thirty (30) days; (c) the
making of an assignment by Tenant for the benefit of its creditors (no cure
period); (d) the appointment of a receiver or trustee of all or part of Tenant's
property (no cure period); (e) the filing by Tenant of a petition in bankruptcy
or for reorganization or for an arrangement with its creditors or for any other
relief under any bankruptcy or similar law (no cure period); (f) the filing of a
petition against Tenant for its reorganization or for an arrangement under any
bankruptcy law or other law, for which the applicable cure period is ninety (90)
days. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Landlord need not give notice and an
opportunity to cure the same kind of default more than twice in any twelve month
period; but if the same or a similar kind of default occurs a third

                                       7
<PAGE>
 
time within any twelve month period, Landlord may elect to terminate this Lease
upon thirty (30) days notice regardless of any subsequent cure by Tenant.

     In the event that this Lease is terminated in the manner provided for in
this paragraph 20, or by court proceedings or otherwise, or in the event that
the Premises, or any part thereof, shall be abandoned by Tenant during the said
term, Landlord or Landlord's agents, servants or representatives may, at any
time after written notice to Tenant and the times set forth in this paragraph
20, reenter and resume possession of said Premises, or any part thereof, and
remove all persons and property therefrom, either by any suitable action or
proceeding at law or by force or otherwise, without being liable for any damages
therefor. No reentry by Landlord shall be deemed to be an acceptance of a
surrender of this Lease; and Tenant agrees that in the event this Lease in
accordance with its provisions, is terminated because of Tenant's default,
Landlord's lien in and to this Lease and any improvements on or hereinafter
placed on the Premises and on any equity of Tenant in and to any furnishings,
equipment, fixtures or any other personal property, shall forthwith attach, such
lien being granted for the purposes of securing the performance of Tenant's
obligation hereunder.

     In case the rent or any installment of said rent hereby agreed to be paid
shall at any time be in default, and the default shall not be cured within ten
(10) days, with or without notice, the Landlord shall have the right to distrain
therefor; and in case the rent or any installments of said rent shall remain in
arrears in violation of the default provisions, or in case the Tenant shall
violate any of the covenants on its part herein contained and shall fail to
rectify same in accordance with the provisions set forth for curing a default
herein, then in either event the Landlord shall be entitled to reenter and annul
this Lease, and all rents shall thereupon cease.

     The Landlord, upon the happening of any of the events giving it the right
to annul and cancel this Lease, shall in addition to all other remedies be
entitled to the benefit of all of the provisions of law for the speedy recovery
of lands and tenements under this Lease held over by the Tenant in New Castle
County, Delaware that are now in force or may hereafter be enacted.

21. ADDITIONAL REMEDIES OF LANDLORD:
    ------------------------------- 

     In the event that this Lease is terminated in the manner set forth in
paragraph 20 hereof, or by court proceedings or otherwise, or if the Premises
shall be abandoned by Tenant during the term hereof, Landlord may for its own
account, relet the whole or any portion of said Premises for any period equal to
or greater or less than the remainder of the original term of this Lease for any
sum which it may deem reasonable, to any tenants which it may deem suitable and
satisfactory, and for any use and purposes which it may deem appropriate, but in
no event shall Landlord be under any obligation to relet the Premises for any
purpose which Landlord may regard as injurious to the Improvements, or to any
tenant which Landlord, in the exercise of reasonable discretion shall deem to be
objectionable. In the event of such termination of this Lease or if the Premises
are abandoned, or in the event of any default mentioned in paragraph 20 hereof,
and whether or not the Premises be relet, and whether this Lease be terminated
or not, Landlord shall be entitled to recover of Tenant, and Tenant hereby
agrees to pay to Landlord as damages, the following:

     (i) An amount equal to the amount of the rent reserved under this Lease,
less the rent, if any, net of expenses, collected by Landlord on reletting the
Premises, which shall be due and payable by Tenant to Landlord on the several
days on which the rent herein reserved would have become payable under this
Lease.

                                       8
<PAGE>
 
   (ii) In addition to the damages hereinbefore provided for in this paragraph
21, an amount equal to the cost (a) of placing the Premises in the condition
in which Tenant has agreed to surrender them to Landlord and (b) of performing
any other covenant herein contained which Tenant has agreed to perform, other
than the covenant to pay rent. The damages mentioned in this subdivision (ii)
shall become immediately due and payable by Tenant to Landlord upon the
termination of this Lease.

     Without any previous notice or demand, separate actions may be maintained
by Landlord against Tenant from time to time to recover any damages which, at
the commencement of any such action, have then or theretofore become due and
payable to Landlord under this paragraph 21, without waiting until the end of
the term of this Lease. Without being limited by the foregoing, Landlord shall
be entitled to recover its attorneys fees in the successful enforcement of its
rights and remedies under this Lease.

22. RIGHT TO ASSIGN AND SUBLEASE:
    ---------------------------- 

     Tenant may not assign this Lease or sublet the Premises without the prior
written consent of Landlord, which consent will not be unreasonably withheld,
provided that in the event of any such assignment or subletting with consent,
Tenant shall remain liable for the performance of Tenant's obligations during
the term hereof.

23. INSPECTION BY LANDLORD, ETC.:
    ----------------------       

     Landlord and its agents shall have the right at all reasonable times during
the term to enter the Premises for the purpose of performing the maintenance and
repairs required of it by this Lease and for the purpose of inspecting the same
and, during the last one hundred and twenty (120) days of the term, to show both
the interior and exterior of the Premises to prospective Tenants or purchasers
and to place "For Rent" or "For Sale" signs thereon.

24. ASSIGNMENT OF LANDLORD'S INTEREST:
    --------------------------------- 

     If Landlord should ever assign this Lease or the rents hereunder to a
creditor as security for a debt, Tenant shall, after notice of such assignment
and upon demand by Landlord or the assignee, pay all sums thereafter becoming
due Landlord hereunder to the assignee (from and after the time Tenant is
furnished with such assignee's address) and furnish such evidence of insurance
coverages required hereunder as the lender may reasonably require so as to
protect the assignee's interest as it may appear and furnish such assurances
to the assignee.

25. ATTORNMENT:
    ---------- 

     In the event the herein demised Premises are sold at any foreclosure sale
or sales, by virtue of any judicial proceedings or otherwise, the Lease shall
continue in full force and effect and Tenant agrees upon request to attorn to
and acknowledge the foreclosure purchaser or purchasers at such sale as Landlord
hereunder.

26. SUBORDINATION:
    ------------- 

     This Lease shall be subject and subordinate to the lien of any present or
future mortgage or mortgages upon the Premises or any property of which the
Premises are a part irrespective of the time of execution or the time of
recording of any such mortgage or mortgages provided that in the event of
foreclosure or other action taken under any mortgage by the holders thereof,
this Lease and the rights of Tenant hereunder shall not be disturbed but shall
continue in full force and effect so long as Tenant shall not be

                                       9
<PAGE>
 
in default hereunder. The word "mortgage" as used herein includes mortgages,
deeds of trust or other similar instruments and modifications, extensions,
renewals and replacements thereof and any and all advances thereunder. Tenant
hereby agrees to execute such agreement substantially in the same form as
Exhibit E, or in any other form required by Landlord's lender.

27. MORTGAGEE PROTECTION:
    -------------------- 

     Tenant agrees to give any Mortgagees and/or Trust Deed Holders, by
registered mail, a copy of any notice of default served upon the Landlord,
provided that prior to such notice, Tenant has been notified in writing (by way
of Notice of Assignment of Rents and Leases, or otherwise) of the addresses of
such Mortgagees and/or Trust Deed Holders, and has been requested to give such
notices. Tenant further agrees that if Landlord shall have failed to cure such
default within the applicable cure period, then the Mortgagees and/or Trust Deed
Holders shall have thirty (30) days from the date of receiving notice within
which to cure such default or if such default cannot be cured within that time,
then such additional time as may be necessary if within such thirty (30) days
any Mortgagee and/or Trust Deed Holder has commenced and is diligently pursuing
the remedies necessary to cure such default (including but not limited to
commencement of foreclosure proceedings if necessary to affect such cure), in
which event this Lease shall not be terminated while such remedies are being so
diligently pursued.

28. NON-DISTURBANCE:
    --------------- 

     Landlord covenants and warrants that if Tenant timely pays the rent
provided for in this Lease and timely performs all of its covenants herein set
forth, then Tenant shall peaceably and quietly have, hold and enjoy the Premises
and all appurtenances thereon during the full term of this Lease.

29. FAILURE TO INSIST UPON STRICT PERFORMANCE:
    ----------------------------------------- 

     The failure of either party to insist upon a strict performance of any of
the terms, conditions and covenants herein contained shall not be deemed a
waiver of any rights or remedies that either party may have and shall not be
deemed a waiver of any subsequent breach or default in the terms, conditions
and covenants herein contained. This instrument may not be changed, modified
or discharged orally or by course of conduct, but only by written instrument
signed with the same formalities as this Lease.

30. TENANT HOLDING OVER:
    ------------------- 

     In the event that Tenant holds over at the expiration of the original term
of this Lease or at the earlier termination thereof, Landlord shall be entitled
to all the remedies now or hereafter in effect in New Castle County, Delaware
relating to the speedy recovery of possession of lands and damages for wrongful
detention.

     Nothing contained in this paragraph 30 shall be construed to limit in any
way Landlord's further remedies for nonpayment or late payment of rent.

31. UTILITY LINES AND FACILITIES:
    ---------------------------- 

     Landlord reserves the right to place (or permit any other tenant in the
Improvements so to place) in, over, below and upon the Premises (in such manner
as to not significantly interfere with Tenant's use of the Premises), utility
lines, conduits, pipes, tunneling and the like to service the Premises and other
portions of the Improvements and to use, replace, repair and maintain (or permit
any other tenant so to do) such utility lines, conduits, pipes, tunneling and
the like, in, over, below and upon the

                                       10
<PAGE>
 
Premises in such manner as will not significantly interfere with Tenant's
enjoyment thereof, provided that Landlord shall use its best efforts to see
that such work does not significantly interfere with the ongoing business and
operations of Tenant, that such work shall be done expeditiously and in a
workmanlike manner, and further that the Premises shall, upon conclusion of
the work, be restored to substantially the same conditions as they were prior
to the commencement of the work.

32. OTHER TENANTS:
    ------------- 

     Landlord shall have no liability to Tenant for the acts or omissions of
other tenants, nor shall any provisions of its leases with other tenants be
deemed for the benefit of Tenant. Landlord shall have the right to accomplish or
permit from time to time leasehold improvements to other portions of the
Building for other tenants and Tenant shall accept any normal, necessary or
reasonable inconvenience or disturbance resulting therefrom; but Landlord shall
endeavor to minimize such inconvenience or disturbance, insofar as practicable
without additional expense or unusual procedure.

33. SIGNS:
    ----- 

     Tenant shall not place any signs on the exterior of the premises without
the written consent of Landlord, which consent shall not be unreasonably
withheld, provided that any such signs shall be compatible with the standard

    ----------- 

     Upon the expiration or other termination of the term of this Lease, Tenant
shall quit and surrender to Landlord the demised premises, broom clean, in good
order and condition excepting only ordinary wear and tear and damage or

agents or invitees, or the elements or any other cause beyond Tenant's
reasonable control; and Tenant shall remove all of its property prior to such
expiration.

default herein by Landlord, and Landlord shall have at least thirty (30) days

39. CAPTIONS AND HEADINGS:
    --------------------- 

     The captions and headings throughout this Lease are for convenience and
reference only, and the words contained therein shall in no way be held or
deemed to define, limit, describe, explain, modify, amplify, or add to the
interpretation, construction or meaning of any provision of or the scope or
intent of this Lease nor in any way affect this Lease.

40. CONSTRUCTION AND INTERPRETATION:
    ------------------------------- 

     This Agreement represents the entire understanding of the parties. There
are no conditions, side agreements, representations, promises or terms, oral or
written, except those expressed herein. The provisions of this Agreement shall
not be deemed changed, modified, waived or abandoned, nor shall the terms of any
part thereof be surrendered, except by writing signed by all the parties hereto,
or their successors and assigns. The rights and obligations contained in this
Agreement shall inure to the benefit of and be binding upon and enforceable
against the parties and their respective heirs, personal representatives,
successors and assigns. In reference to the parties, the singular and the
plural, and the masculine, feminine and neuter shall be interchangeable as
required by the context and the party or parties to whom reference is made.

     This Agreement shall be construed and interpreted in accordance with the
laws of the State of Delaware, except that no ambiguity shall be resolved for
or against either party on the basis of authorship or nonauthorship of this
document; and no weight shall be given to the subheadings of each article
hereof. If any term or provision of this lease or the application thereof to
any person or circumstance shall, to any extent, be invalid or unenforceable,
the remainder of this lease, or the application of such term or provisions to
persons or circumstances other than those as to which it is held invalid or
unenforceable, shall not be affected thereby and each term and provision of
this lease shall be valid and be enforced to the fullest extent permitted by
law.

     Whenever Tenant is required under this Lease to pay a pro-rated share of
taxes, sewer, or other charges or expenses, such proration shall be based on
that ratio which Tenant's total square footage of leased space bears to the
total square footage of all leased space in the building in which the premises
are located.

     This lease has been made and entered into by and between Landlord and
Tenant based on their mutual assumption that it is completely consistent with
Delaware law, particularly the Delaware Landlord Tenant Code as applicable to
commercial real estate. In the event that this assumption is refuted, disproved,
or otherwise shown to be false in whole or in part with the result that any
provision herein designed to implement this lease as a net lease to Landlord by
placing various obligations with respect to the Premises on Tenant shall be
ruled invalid or unenforceable by any Court, Magistrate, Justice of the Peace,
Attorney General opinion

                                       12

or the authority, then the basic rent herein provided for shall be raised by a
panel of three arbitrators appointed by the Chancellor of the Court of
Chancery in an annual amount sufficient to compensate Landlord for the removal
of any obligation on Tenant and/or the imposition of any obligation on
Landlord which, had the parties' assumption been correct, would not have been
removed or imposed. In establishing this amount, all doubts shall be resolved
in favor of Landlord, so that the raise in rent will clearly be adequate
compensation. Should any Court, Magistrate, Justice of the Peace, Attorney
General opinion or other authority rule that the rent may not be thus raised,
then Landlord shall have the right upon ninety (90) days written notice to
Tenant, to terminate this lease the same as if it were about to expire without
further right of renewal on the part of Tenant.

41. ENVIRONMENTAL MATTERS:
    --------------------- 

     A. Tenant represents and warrants that the use of the Premises will not
result in or involve the use, generation, manufacture, refining, transportation,
treatment, storage, handling or disposal of, or the conduct or performance of
any activity in connection with, any hazardous substance or hazardous waste, as
such terms are defined in the Delaware General Waste Management Act, 7 Del. C.,
                                                                       ---     
Chapter 60, the Delaware Hazardous Waste Management Act, 7 Del. C., Chapter 63,
                                                           ---                 
the Federal Resource SS6690, et seq., the Federal Comprehensive Environmental
Response, Compensation and Liability Act of 1980, as amended, 42 U.S.C. SS9601,
et seq., and the regulations promulgated under said Acts (collectively
"substance") which would subject the Premises or Landlord to any liability,
including damages, penalties or fines, or any lien on the Premises under such
Acts or under the Federal common law or the common law of the State of Delaware.

     B. Landlord and its agent(s) shall have the right from time to time, but
not more often than once in any six (6) consecutive calendar months unless a
violation is discovered or corrective actions are needed (in which event one
or more follow-up inspections may be scheduled), to conduct an environmental
audit of the Premises and of Tenant's use thereof, during normal business
hours on a business day. Tenant and its employees shall fully cooperate in
such audit including, but not limited to, identifying substances in
containers, opening closed storage spaces, and so on. Tenant will keep, and
shall produce for inspection and copying upon Landlord's request, accurate
records of all Substances brought upon the premises other than cleaning
supplies used in the ordinary course of Tenant's housekeeping procedures, in
quantities not exceeding Tenant's monthly needs. In the event that Landlord's
audit (or any other event) reveals that Tenant is violating or has violated
environmental laws and regulations or is engaged in activities or has created
conditions upon the Premises which, in the opinion of Landlord's environmental
specialist, create an unreasonable risk of environmental harm or violation,
then Tenant shall promptly at its expense comply with the written
recommendations of Landlord's environmental specialist to cease and to remedy
past violations of environmental laws, and/or follow procedures and correct
conditions so as to minimize the risk of environmental harm or violations in
the future. Tenant, Landlord and its environmental specialist shall endeavor
to protect the environment and avoid risk of further or future environmental
harm in the most practical, economic and effective way. Any disagreements
shall be resolved by the Delaware Department of Natural Resources and
Environmental Control.

     C. In the event that any environmental audit reveals a violation of law or
necessitates recommended changes in conditions or procedures by Landlord's
environmental specialist, Tenant shall pay the reasonable fees of such
specialist, over and above the normal charge for a routine audit, and shall pay
for any follow-up inspection or inspections to oversee and/or approve remedial
measures. Upon termination of this Lease for any reason,

                                       13
<PAGE>
 
and as a condition of Tenant's removal of its equipment, supplies and other
personal property from the Premises, Landlord's environmental specialist shall
perform a final audit and inspection of the Premises, and Tenant at its
expense shall perform or cause to be performed any remedial action recommended
by such specialist in order to leave the Premises in the same environmentally
acceptable condition as when this Lease was entered (except for harm not
caused by Tenant, its agents or invitees). Tenant's officer(s) and director(s)
if Tenant is a corporation, managing venturer(s) if Tenant is a joint venture,
or trustee(s) if Tenant is a trust, shall be personally and individually
liable to Landlord for any violation by Tenant of this Section [42] of the
Lease.

     D. Tenant shall indemnify and hold harmless Landlord, its directors,
officers, partners and any of its employees, against all cost incurred
(including, without limitation, amounts paid pursuant to penalties, fines,
orders, judgment or settlements and attorney's fee originating out of any claim
made by Federal, State or local agencies or departments or private litigants or
third parties with respect to violations or alleged violations by Tenant, its
agents, employees or invitees of environmental or health laws, rules,
regulations, orders or common law, as said laws, etc. are set forth above or
otherwise.

     E. Landlord shall indemnify and hold harmless Tenant, its officers,
directors, partners and any of its employees against all costs incurred
(including, without limitation, amounts paid pursuant to penalties, fines,
orders, judgments or settlements and attorneys' fees), arising out of any claim
made by Federal, State or local agencies or departments or private litigants or
third parties with respect to violations by Landlord, its agents, employees or
invitees of environmental or health laws, or regulations, orders or common law
as said laws, etc., are set forth above, or otherwise, provided that such
violations or alleged violations are not in whole or in part caused by or in
whole or in part related to Tenant or Tenant's use of the Premises. As used
herein Tenant shall mean and include Tenant and Tenants agents, employees and
invitees.

42. SECURITY DEPOSIT
    ----------------

     Tenant has deposited with Landlord $15,333.33 as security for the full and
                                        ----------                             
faithful performance of each and every item, provision, covenant and condition
of this lease. In the event Tenant defaults in respect of any of the terms,
provisions, covenants, or conditions of this lease, including but not limited
to the payment of rent, Landlord may use, apply or retain the whole or any
part of such security for the payment of any rent in default or for any other
sum which Landlord may spend or be required to spend by reason of Tenant's
default. Should Tenant faithfully and fully comply with all of the terms,
provisions, covenants and conditions of this lease, the security or any
balance, thereof shall be returned to Tenant or, at the option of Landlord, to
the last assignee of Tenant's interest in this lease at the expiration of the
term hereof.

     In the event of a sale of the Building, Landlord shall have the right to
transfer the aforesaid security deposit to the purchaser of the Building or to
Tenant and Landlord shall thereupon be released by Tenant all liability for the
return of said security; and Tenant agrees to look solely to the new owner of
the Building for the return of said security deposit; and it is agreed that the
provisions hereof shall apply to every transfer or assignment made of the
security deposit to a new owner of the Building.

                                       14
<PAGE>
 
     Tenant further covenants that it will not assign or encumber or attempt
to assign or encumber the monies deposited herein as security and that neither
Landlord nor its successors or assign shall be bound by any such assignment,
encumbrance, attempted assignment, or attempted encumbrance.

             SUBORDINATION, NONDISTURBANCE AND ATTORNMENT AGREEMENT

     THIS AGREEMENT is dated the ______ day of _________________, 1990, between
____________________________________________, a

Delaware corporation, with offices at
________________________________________________________________________________
____, its successors and assigns (including but not limited to the holder of the
Note and Mortgage hereinafter described) ("Mortgagee"), and
_________________________________________________________, with its principal
place of business at
________________________________________________________________________________
_____("Tenant").

     Tenant has entered into a certain leasedated_______________________________
 _____ (the "Lease"), the landlord's interest in which is presently held by
Mattei Corporation ("Landlord"), covering certain premises situated and known
as______________________________________________________________________________
_____, as more particularly set forth in the Lease (the "Demised Premises"). The
Demised Premises constitute a portion of the real property described on Exhibit
                                                                        -------
"A" attached hereto. Mortgagee has agreed to make a loan to Landlord, to be
- ---                                                                        
evidenced by a note (the "Note") executed by Landlord, and secured inter alia by
                                                                   ----------   
a mortgage on the Demised Premises and on other real and personal property (the
"Mortgage"), intended to be recorded in the aforesaid public records. Tenant
desires to be assured of continued occupancy of the Demised Premises under the
terms of the Lease.

     NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the sum of One Dollar ($1.00) by each
party in hand paid to the other, the receipt of which is hereby acknowledged,
and in consideration of the mutual promises, covenants and agreements herein
contained, the parties hereto, intending to be legally bound hereby, promise,
covenant and agree as follows:

     1. The Lease and all estates, rights, options, liens and charges therein
contained or created thereunder is and shall be subject and subordinate to the
lien and effect of the Mortgage insofar as it affects the real and personal
property of which the Demised Premises forms a part, and to all renewals,
modifications, consolidations, replacements and extensions thereof, to the
full extent of the principal sum secured thereby and interest thereon, with
the same force and effect as if the Mortgage had been executed, delivered, and
duly recorded among the above mentioned public records, prior to the execution
and delivery of the Lease.

     2. In the event Mortgagee takes possession of the Demised premises as
mortgagee-in-possession, by foreclosure of the Mortgage, or by acquisition of
title in lieu of foreclosure, Mortgagee agrees not to affect or disturb Tenant's
right to possession of the Demised Premises in the exercise of Mortgagee's
rights so long as Tenant is not then in default under any of the terms,
covenants or conditions of the Lease.

     3. (a) In the event that Mortgagee succeeds to the interest of Landlord
under the Lease by foreclosure or by acquisition of title to the Demised
Premises in lieu of foreclosure, Mortgagee and Tenant hereby agree to be bound
to one another under all of the terms, covenants and conditions of the Lease;
accordingly, from and after such event, Mortgagee and Tenant shall have the same
remedies against one another for the breach of any agreement contained in the
Lease as Tenant and Landlord had before Mortgagee succeeded to the interest of
Landlord; provided, however, that Mortgagee shall not be bound by any rent or
additional rent which Tenant might have paid for more than the current month to
Landlord, nor shall Mortgagee be liable to Tenant for any damages arising out of
events occurring prior to the date Mortgagee succeeds to the interest of

                                       18
<PAGE>
 
Landlord under the Lease.

     (b) This attornment shall be effective and self operative without the
execution of any further instrument by any of the parties hereto immediately
upon the Mortgagee succeeding to the interest of the Landlord under the Lease;
and the respective rights and obligations of Tenant and Mortgagee upon such
attornment, to the extent of the then remaining balance of the term of the Lease
and any extension or renewal permitted thereby, shall be and are the same as are
now set forth therein.

     4. In the event that anyone else acquires title to or the right to
possession of the Demised Premises upon the foreclosure of the Mortgage, or upon
the sale of the Demised Premises by Mortgagee or its successors or assigns after
foreclosure or acquisition of title in lieu thereof or otherwise, Tenant agrees
not to seek to terminate the Lease by reason thereof, but shall remain bound
unto the new owner and the new owner agrees to be bound to Tenant under all of
the terms, covenants and conditions of the Lease, as provided in Paragraph 3
above, and any liability of Mortgagee to Tenant under the Lease or hereunder
shall terminate.

     5. Tenant hereby covenants and agrees to and with Mortgagee:

     (a) to deliver to Mortgagee a duplicate of each notice of default delivered
to Landlord at the same time as such notice is given to Landlord;

     (b) not to seek to terminate the Lease by reason of any default of Landlord
without prior written notice thereof to Mortgagee and the lapse thereafter of
the greater of (i) thirty (30) days after giving of such notice to Mortgagee or
(ii) such time as under the Lease was offered to Landlord in which to remedy the
default, within which time Mortgagee, at its option, may remedy any such
default; provided, however, that with respect to any default of Landlord under
the Lease which cannot be remedied within such time, if Mortgagee commences to
cure such default within such time and thereafter diligently proceeds with such
efforts, Mortgagee shall have such time as is reasonably necessary to complete
curing such default;

     (c) to promptly certify in writing to Mortgagee in connection with any
proposed assignment of the Mortgage, whether or not to Tenant's knowledge any
default on the part of Landlord then exists under the Lease;

     (d) not to modify the Lease orally or in any other manner except by an
agreement in writing signed by the Mortgagee, for such time as the Mortgage
remains a lien on the property or the Note it secures remains unpaid;

     (e) not to assign its interest in the Lease without the prior written
consent of Owner and Mortgagee. Tenant shall remain obligated under the Lease
notwithstanding any such assignment;

     (f) upon receipt from Mortgagee of notice of any default under the Note or
Mortgage, to pay all rents and other sums due under the Lease directly to
Mortgagee.

     6. This Agreement shall inure to and bind the heirs, administrators,
executors, successors and assigns of the parties hereto.

whether currently in effect or hereafter adopted. The foregoing restrictions
shall not apply to the storage and use of common office and cleaning supplies
necessary for routine office operations, which are properly stored in

Landlord will have, in addition to any other remedies available, the right to
immediately terminate this Lease.

ARTICLE 3. TERM OF LEASE
- ------------------------

     Section 3.1  The Demised Premises are hereby leased for the Term which will
commence on the Commencement Date. If Landlord is performing the Tenant
Improvements, Landlord will attempt to give Tenant as much advance notice of the
Commencement Date as is possible; provided, however, that Landlord's failure to
give such notice will not constitute a default under, or breach of, this Lease.

     Section 3.2  If the Commencement Date is any date other than the first day
of a calendar month, the period between the Commencement Date and the last day
of the calendar month during which the Commencement Date occurs (the "Partial
Month") will be added to the Term.

Commencement Date Agreement substantially in the form attached hereto as Exhibit

with any of its other obligations hereunder.

<PAGE>
 
     Section 3.5  If delivery of possession of the Demised Premises to Tenant is
delayed beyond the estimated Commencement Date set forth in the agreement of
Lease, regardless of the reasons for or cause of such delay, this Lease will not
be void or voidable and the Term will commence as provided above. Further,
Landlord will not be liable to Tenant for any expenses or damages whatsoever
arising from or relating to such delay, except as may be expressly provided
elsewhere in this Lease.

ARTICLE 4. RENT AND ADDITIONAL RENT
- -----------------------------------

     Section 4.1 Tenant will pay Base Rent and all Additional Rent without any
setoff, deduction or demand whatsoever. Base Rent and Additional Rent will be
paid in monthly installments, in advance, on the first day of each calendar
month during the Term in the amounts set forth in or determined pursuant to the
Agreement of Lease.

     Section 4.2  Notwithstanding the foregoing, if the Commencement Date is not
the first day of a calendar month, Base Rent for the Partial Month will be
prorated on a daily basis and will be paid on the Commencement Date (and the
total Base Rent accruing for the first Lease Year of the Term will be the annual
Base Rent set forth in the Agreement of Lease plus the prorated rental for the
Partial Month).

     Section 4.3  Tenant will pay to Landlord, as Additional Rent, Tenant's Pro
Rata Share of Operating Expenses and Real Estate Taxes as provided in Exhibit E,
all charges for utility services to the Demised Premises and all other items
designated as Additional Rent in the Agreement of Lease or in these General
Terms of Lease.

     Section 4.4  Any and all charges and costs which Tenant is required to pay
pursuant to this Lease, together with all interest and penalties that may accrue
thereon in the event of Tenant's failure to pay such amounts, and all damages,
costs and expenses which Landlord may incur by reason of any default of Tenant
or failure on Tenant's part to comply with the terms of this Lease, will be
deemed to be Additional Rent. In the event of nonpayment by Tenant of any
Additional Rent Landlord will have all of the rights and remedies with respect
thereto which Landlord has for the nonpayment of Base Rent.

     Section 4.5  In addition to any other remedies provided for herein, in the
event that any installment of Base Rent or payment of Additional Rent is more
than five (5) calendar days overdue then a "late charge" of 5% of the amount(s)
so overdue may be charged by Landlord for each month or part thereof that the
same remains overdue. This charge will be deemed compensation to Landlord for
the inconvenience and expense of policing and processing late payment(s) and
will be in addition to and not in lieu of any other remedy Landlord may have
under the circumstances and in addition to any reasonable fees and charges of
any agents or attorneys Landlord may employ in the event of any default
hereunder, whether authorized herein or by law. At the option of Landlord, any
such late charge, if not previously paid, will be added to and become part of
the next succeeding payment of Base Rent to be made hereunder.

ARTICLE 5. PREPARATION FOR OCCUPANCY; EXCUSABLE DELAY
- -----------------------------------------------------

     Section 5.1  Landlord or Tenant shall construct the Tenant improvements
within the Demised Premises in accordance with Exhibit C. If performed by
Landlord, the work will be deemed completed upon the issuance of a Certificate
or Temporary Certificate of Occupancy, notwithstanding the fact that minor or
insubstantial construction, adjustment of equipment and/or fixtures and/or
decoration remains to be performed.

     Section 5.2  If Landlord is prevented from or delayed in complying with its
obligations set forth in this or any other Article of this Lease because of
delay(s) (whether effecting Landlord or its contractors, subcontractors or
materialmen) caused by or due to (a) actual or threatened administrative
proceedings or litigation which interfere with Landlord's ability to begin or
complete construction, (b) delays in obtaining approval of construction plans,
building permits or Certificates or Temporary Certificates of Occupancy, (c)
strikes or other labor troubles, riots, fire, acts of God, governmental
intervention or regulations, inability to obtain materials, weather, holding
over of tenants, or any
<PAGE>
 
other matters which are not within the reasonable control of Landlord (all of
the foregoing hereinafter referred to collectively as "Excusable Delay"), than
the schedule set   forth herein, if adversely affected by an Excusable Delay,
will be extended by one day for each day of an Excusable Delay.

     Section 5.3  If Landlord's ability, when required to do so, to obtain a
building permit or Certificate of Occupancy or Temporary Certificate of
Occupancy or to complete the Tenant Improvements, or deliver possession of all
or part of the Demised Premises is delayed due to any act or omission of Tenant
or its agents, employees, contractors or subcontractors ("Tenant Delay"), then
the Demised Premises, building permit and/or Certificate or Temporary
Certificate of Occupancy will be deemed to have been completed or obtained, as
the case may be, and possession of the Demised Premises will be deemed to have
been delivered to Tenant, on the date when such event would have occurred but
for such Tenant Delay as same is certified in writing by Landlord's contractor.
Such delay shall include, but not be limited to:

        (a) delay due to untimely submission of any Tenant Plans after the
Tenant Plans Deadline or delay in giving authorizations or approvals required
for the preparations for or construction of the Tenant Improvements;

        (b) delay due to changes made or requested by or on behalf of Tenant in
the Tenant Plans (notwithstanding Landlord's approval of such changes);
        (c) delay due to any other interference with work in the Demised
Premises or any other Act or omission, by Tenant, its agents, employees,
contractors or subcontractors;
        (d) delay due to the postponement of any work at Tenant's request;
        (e) delay due to performance of any work in the Demised Premises by any
person or entity employed or retained by or on behalf of Tenant;

        (f)  delay due to Tenant requesting materials, finishes, equipment or
supplies where delivery or installation is unavailable from Landlord's or its
contractor's ordinary trade sources in such sequence with the
delivery/installation of other equipment, fixtures and the like or as is
required under good construction scheduling practice, so as to delay Landlord in
completing the Demised Premises and obtaining a Certificate or Temporary
Certificate of Occupancy as scheduled; and

        (g) delay due to tenant's failure to authorize Landlord to proceed with
the Tenant Improvements or to timely pay to Landlord the amounts, if any, due
pursuant to Exhibit C.

     Section 5.4 If, as a result of any Tenant Delay pursuant to the
provisions of this Article, Landlord sustains any damages or any additional
costs or expenses for labor or material, Tenant will pay to Landlord as
Additional Rent (in addition to the rent payable as a result of the
establishing of the Commencement Date as provided in Section 5.3) all such
damages, costs and expenses that Landlord may sustain.

ARTICLE 6. UTILITIES AND SERVICES
- ---------------------------------

     Section 6.1  If required under the Agreement of Lease, Landlord will
arrange to have furnished to the Demised Premises and/or the Common Facilities,
as applicable, the following services, utilities, and facilities:

        (a) Heat (to maintain a minimum temperature of 45 degrees Fahrenheit
in warehouse portions of the Demised Premises), hot and cold water, and air
conditioning and heat to office portions of the Demised Premises during
regular business hours in seasons when they are required, as determined in
Landlord's reasonable judgment.

        (b)  Reasonably adequate electrical service, provided that Tenant's use
of electrical energy in the Demised Premises will not at any time exceed the
safe capacity of electrical service applicable to the conductors and other
electrical equipment in or servicing the Demised Premises, as determined by
Landlord. In order to insure that such capacity is not exceeded and to avert
possible adverse effect upon the Property's electrical service, Tenant will not,
without Landlord's prior written consent in such instance, (i) connect any
additional fixtures, appliances or equipment to the electric distribution system
other than (A) in accordance with plans approved by Landlord and (B) electric
typewriters, word processors, personal computers, calculators, copy machines,
and other small office machines, or (ii) make any alteration or addition to the
electric system.

        (c) Removal of ice and snow from the Common

     -2-
<PAGE>
 
Facilities during regular business hours within a reasonable time after
accumulation thereof.

        (d) Maintenance of the Common Facilities.

     Section 6.2  Tenant expressly agrees that Landlord will not be responsible
for the failure of supply to Tenant of any of the aforesaid or any other utility
or service, nor will Landlord be liable for any damages resulting from, nor will
there be any abatement of Base Rent or Additional Rent as a result of such
failure.

     Section 6.3  Landlord and Tenant will comply with any applicable energy or
water conservation measures, voluntary or mandatory, which may be imposed by any
federal, state, county or municipal governmental agency, including, without
limitation, limits on permitted HVAC temperature settings and requirements
limiting volume of consumption. The effect of such compliance will not be deemed
an eviction, actual or constructive, or a breach of the provisions of this Lease
which will be suspended, as necessary, for the period(s) during which such
conservation measures are in effect.

     Section 6.4 Tenant will pay all metered charges as Additional Rent.

ARTICLE 7. COMPLIANCE WITH LAWS
- -------------------------------

     Section 7.1  Tenant will, at its expense, promptly observe and comply or
cause compliance with all laws and ordinances, orders, rules, regulations and

of the Board of Fire Underwriters and/or of any other body exercising similar
functions, and of all insurance companies writing policies covering the Demised
Premises, or any part thereof, foreseen or unforeseen, ordinary as well as
extraordinary, which relate or pertain to Tenant's use and occupancy of the
Demised Premises, including the conduct of Tenant's business therein, and
whether or not the same (a) involve any change of governmental policy, (b) are
now in force or are hereafter passed, enacted or directed, or (c) require
extraordinary repairs, alterations, equipment or additions or any work (or
changes to such work or any other requirements incidental thereto) of any kind
which may be applicable to, or in and about, the Demised Premises, including,
without limitation, the fixtures and equipment thereof, or the purposes to which
the Demised Premises are put, or manner of use of the Demised Premises at the
commencement or during the Term of this Lease.

     Section 7.2 Tenant's obligations as set forth in Section 7.1 will
include, but not be limited to, compliance with any and all laws, orders,
rules, regulations and requirements relating to zoning and building codes,
life safety and environmental control, conservation or protection, including,
without limitation, the Occupational Safety and Health Act ("OSHA"), and any
applicable environmental laws, regulations or ordinances, with respect to the
use of and operations at the Demised Premises.

     Section 7.3  In the event of Tenant's failure to comply fully with this
Article 7, Landlord may, but will not be required to, perform any or all of
Tenant's obligations as aforesaid in which event all sums paid or incurred by
Landlord in performing such obligations, together with interest thereon from the
date that Landlord made such expenditure at the rate of five (5%) percent above
the rate which CoreStates Bank, N.A. announces as its so-called prime rate or
base rate, from time to time, or the maximum rate allowed by law, whichever is
less, will be deemed Additional Rent hereunder and, except as otherwise in this
Lease expressly provided, will be payable to Landlord on demand or, at the
option of Landlord, may be added to any rent due or thereafter becoming due
under this Lease.

     Section 7.4  Tenant will defend, indemnify and hold harmless Landlord, its
agents, successors and assigns from and against, and be responsible for payment
of, any and all costs, expenses, claims, fines, penalties and damages that may,
in any manner, arise out of or be imposed because of the failure of Tenant to
comply with the provisions of this Article
<PAGE>
 
7, including the expenses incurred by Landlord in the exercise of its rights
pursuant to Section 7.3, and all of the foregoing shall be deemed Additional
Rent.

     Section 7.5  Tenant agrees to clean up all Hazardous Substances on the
Common Facilities, in the Demised Premises, or on the Property, if caused or
permitted by Tenant (or if Tenant shall be otherwise responsible therefor), in a
manner which shall comply with all applicable environmental laws and
requirements. Upon request, Tenant shall cooperate with Landlord in furnishing
to a governmental authority any information which may be required regarding
environmental matters. Tenant agrees to indemnify, defend and hold Landlord
harmless from and against any and all loss, damages, claims of third parties,
costs of correction, tests, studies, expenses (including attorney's fees and
costs of suit or administrative proceedings) or fines arising out of or in
connection with Tenant's failure to comply with the terms of this Section.

     Section 7.6  Tenant's obligations under this Article 7 shall survive
termination of the Lease.

ARTICLE 8.  EVENTS OF DEFAULT; REMEDIES
- ---------------------------------------

     Section 8.1

        (a) It will be a default hereunder if, at any time after the date
hereof, any one of the following events (herein called an "event of default")
occurs:

          (i) if Tenant fails to pay any installment of Base Rent or Additional
Rent set forth in the Agreement of Lease, or any Part thereof, when same is due
and payable and such failure continues for five (5) days after the same is due
and payable; or

          (ii) if Tenant fails to pay any other item of Additional Rent or any
other charges required to be paid by Tenant hereunder and such failure continues
for ten (10) days after notice thereof from Landlord to Tenant; or

          (iii) if Tenant fails to perform any of the requirements of this Lease
(other than the payment of money) on the part of Tenant to be performed or
observed and such failure continues for thirty (30) days after notice thereof
from Landlord to Tenant; or

          (iv) if Tenant allows the Demised Premises to become vacant, deserted
or abandoned (the fact that any of Tenant's property remains in the Demised
Premises shall not be evidence that Tenant has not vacated or abandoned the
Demised Premises); or

          (v) if Tenant assigns, mortgages or encumbers this Lease, or sublets
the Demised Premises, or any part thereof, other than as expressly permitted
hereunder; or

          (vii) if Tenant or any guarantor of this Lease makes an assignment for
the benefit of its creditors; or

          (viii) if any petition is filed by or against Tenant or any guarantor
of this Lease in any court, whether or not pursuant to any statute of the United
States or of any State, in any bankruptcy, reorganization, extension,
arrangement or insolvency proceedings, and with regard to a petition filed
against Tenant or any guarantor the same is not dismissed within forty-five (45)
days, provided that during such period Tenant continues to pay all Base Rent and
all Additional Rent and performs all of its obligations under this Lease; or

          (ix) if a receiver or trustee is appointed for all or any substantial
portion of Tenant's property or the property of any guarantor of this Lease, and
with regard to a proceeding brought against Tenant or any guarantor the same is
not dismissed in forty-five (45) days, provided that during such period Tenant
continues to pay all Base Rent and all Additional Rent and performs all of its
obligations under this Lease; or

          (x)  if a petition or a proceeding is filed or commenced by or against
Tenant or any guarantor of this Lease for its dissolution or liquidation (other
than in connection with any merger permitted hereunder), or if Tenant's property
or the property of any guarantor of this Lease is taken by any governmental
authority in connection with a dissolution or liquidation, and with regard to a
petition filed or commenced against Tenant or any guarantor the same is not
dismissed within forty-five (45) days, provided that during such period Tenant
continues to pay all Base Rent and all Additional Rent and performs all of its
obligations under this Lease; or

         (xi) if a levy under judgment against Tenant or any guarantor of this
Lease is not satisfied or bonded within thirty (30) days.

        (b) Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions

                                    -3-
<PAGE>
 
of this Section 8.1, Landlord will not be required to give any notice of
default, and no cure period shall be applicable to the failure of Tenant to
observe or perform any of its agreements or obligations hereunder, if within any
180-day period Tenant has committed two or more defaults hereunder and Landlord
has transmitted to Tenant two or more default notices.

     Section 8.2 Upon the occurrence of an event of default, Landlord shall have
the following rights:

        (a) To accelerate the whole or any part of the Rent for the entire
unexpired balance of the term of this Lease, as well as all other charges,
payments, costs and expenses herein agreed to be paid by Tenant, and any Rent or
other charges, payments, costs and expenses if so accelerated shall, in addition
to any and all amounts of Rent already due and payable and in arrears, and any
other charge or payment herein reserved, included or agreed to be treated or
collected as Rent and any other charge, expense or cost herein agreed to be paid
by Tenant which may be due and payable and in arrears, be deemed due and payable
as if, by the terms and provisions of this Lease, such accelerated Rent and
other charges, payments, costs and expenses were on that date payable in
advance.

        (b)  To enter the Demised Premises and without further demand or notice
proceed to distress and sale of the goods, chattels and personal property there
found to levy the Rent and other charges herein payable as Rent, and Tenant
shall pay all costs and officers' commissions which are permitted by law,
including watchmen's wages and sums chargeable to Landlord, and further
including five percent (5%) commission[s] to the constable or other person
making the levy, and in such case all costs, officers' commissions and other
charges shall immediately attach and become part of the claim of Landlord for
Rent, and any tender of Rent without said costs, commissions and charges made
after the issuance of a warrant of distress, shall not be sufficient to satisfy
the claim of Landlord.

        (c) To re-enter the Demised Premises, together with all additions,
alterations and improvements, and, at the option of Landlord, remove all
persons and all or any property therefrom, either by summary dispossess
proceedings or by any suitable action or proceeding at law or by force or
otherwise, without being liable for prosecution for damages therefor, and
repossess and enjoy the Demised Premises. Upon recovering possession of the
Demised Premises by reason of or based upon or arising out of an event of
default on the part of Tenant, Landlord may, at Landlord's option, either
terminate this Lease or make such alterations and repairs as may be necessary
in order to relet the Demised Premises or any part or parts thereof, either in
Landlord's name or otherwise, for a term or terms which may, at Landlord's
option, be less than or exceed the period which would otherwise have
constituted the balance of the Term of this Lease and at such rent or rents
and upon such other terms and conditions as in Landlord's sole discretion may
seem advisable and to such person or persons as may in Landlord's discretion
seem best; upon each such reletting all rents received by Landlord from such
reletting shall be applied: first, to the payment of any costs and expenses of
such reletting, including brokerage fees, attorney's fees, all costs of such
alterations and repairs, all costs paid or incurred by Landlord for retaking
and repossessing the Demised Premises, and the unamortized portion of any
rental concessions, Tenant Improvements or abatement; second, to the payment
of any indebtedness other than Rent due hereunder from Tenant to Landlord;
third, to the payment of Rent due and unpaid hereunder; and the residue, if
any, shall be held by Landlord and applied in payment of future Rent as it may
become due and payable hereunder. If such rentals received from such reletting
during any month shall be less than that to be paid during that month by
Tenant, Tenant shall pay any such deficiency to Landlord. Such deficiency
shall be calculated and paid monthly. No such re-entry or taking possession of
the Demised Premises or the making of alterations or improvements thereto or
the reletting thereof shall be construed as an election on the part of
Landlord to terminate this Lease unless written notice of such intention be
given to Tenant. Landlord shall in no
<PAGE>
 
event be liable in any way whatsoever for failure to relet the Demised Premises
or, in the event that the Demised Premises or any part or parts thereof are
relet, for failure to collect the Rent thereof under such reletting. Tenant, for
Tenant and Tenant's successors and assigns, hereby irrevocably constitutes and
appoints Landlord Tenant's and their agent to collect the rents due and to
become due under all subleases of the Demised Premises or any parts thereof
without in any way affecting Tenant's obligation to pay any unpaid balance of
Rent due or to become due hereunder. Notwithstanding any such reletting without
termination, Landlord may at any time thereafter elect to terminate this Lease
for such previous breach.

        (d) To terminate this Lease and the term hereby created without any
right on the part of Tenant to waive the forfeiture by payment of any sum due or
by other performance of any condition, term or covenant broken. Whereupon
Landlord shall be entitled to recover, in addition to any and all sums and
damages for violation of Tenant's obligations hereunder in existence at the time
of such termination, damages for Tenant's default in an amount equal to the
amount of the Rent reserved for the balance of the Term of this Lease, as well
as all other charges, payments, costs and expenses herein agreed to be paid by
Tenant, all of which amount shall be immediately due and payable from Tenant to
Landlord.

        (e) To bring a suit or suits for the recovery of any and all such
damages, or for any installments thereof, from time to time at its election, and
nothing herein contained will be deemed to require Landlord to postpone suit
until the date the Term would have expired had the Lease not been terminated as
provided herein or under any provision of law or had Landlord not re-entered the
Demised Premises.

        (f) If any statute or rule of law limits the amount of Landlord's claim
for damages, to prove as and for liquidated damages and have allowed an amount
equal to the maximum allowed by or under any such statute or rule of law.

     Section 8.3  Tenant, for itself and all others claiming through or under
Tenant, including, but not limited to its creditors, upon the termination of
this Lease in accordance with the terms hereof or in the event of re-entry or
recovery of possession of the Demised Premises by process of law or otherwise,
hereby waives to the fullest extent permitted by any statute, law any right of
redemption provided or permitted by any statute, law or decision now or
hereafter in force, and hereby waives, surrenders and gives up all rights or
privileges which it or they may or might have under and by reason of any present
or future law or decision to redeem the Demised Premises or for a continuation
of this Lease after having been dispossessed or ejected therefrom by process of
law.

     Section 8.4  Intentionally omitted

     Section 8.5  When this lease and the term or any extension or renewal
thereof shall have been terminated on account of any default by Tenant, or when
the term hereby created or any extension or renewal thereof shall have expired,
it shall be lawful for any attorney of any court of record to appear as attorney
for Tenant as well as for all persons claiming by, through or under Tenant, and
to sign an agreement for entering in any competent court an amicable action in
ejectment and judgment against Tenant and all persons claiming by, through or
under Tenant and therein confess judgment for the recovery by Landlord of
possession of the Demised Premises, for which this Lease shall be his sufficient
warrant; thereupon, if Landlord so desires, an appropriate writ of possession
may issue forthwith, without any prior writ or proceeding whatsoever, and
provided that if for any reason after such action shall have been commenced it
shall be determined and possession of the Demised Premises remain in or be
restored to Tenant, Landlord shall have the right for the same default and upon
any subsequent default or defaults, or upon the termination of this Lease or
Tenant's right of possession as hereinbefore set forth, to bring one or more
further amicable action or actions as hereinbefore set forth to recover
possession of the Demised Premises and confess judgment for the recovery of
possession of the Demised Premises as hereinbefore provided.

     Section 8.6  In any amicable action of ejectment and/or for rent, Landlord
shall first cause to be filed in such action an affidavit, made by it or someone
acting for it setting forth the facts necessary to authorize the entry of
judgment, of which facts such affidavit shall be conclusive evidence, and if a
true copy of this lease (and of the truth of the copy such affidavit

                                     -4-
<PAGE>
 
shall be sufficient evidence) be filed in such action, it shall not be necessary
to file the original as a warrant of attorney, any rule of Court, custom or
practice to the contrary notwithstanding.

     Section 8.7  Tenant expressly agrees that any judgment, order of decree
entered against him by or in any court or magistrate whether by virtue of the
powers of attorney contained in this Lease, or in any adverse suit or proceeding
shall be final, and that he will not take an appeal, certiorari, writ of error,
exception or objection to the same, or file a motion or rule to strike of or
open or to stay execution of the same and releases to Landlord and to any and
all attorneys who may appear for Tenant all errors in the said proceedings, and
all liability therefor. Tenant expressly waives the benefits of all laws, now or
hereafter in force, exempting any goods on the Demised Premises or elsewhere
from levy or sale in any legal proceedings taken by the Landlord to enforce any
rights under this lease. Tenant further waives the right of inquisition on any
real estate that may be levied upon to collect any amount which may become due
under the terms and conditions of this lease, and does hereby voluntarily
condemn the same and authorizes the Prothonotary to enter a fieri facias or
other process upon Tenant's voluntary condemnation, and further agrees that the
said real estate may be sold on a fieri facias or other process.

     Section 8.8  Tenant represents and warrants that this is a commercial
transaction, that it has had the opportunity to seek the advice of its attorney,
and that it understands and agrees to Landlord's remedies which arise upon an
event of default by Tenant hereunder.

ARTICLE 9. CUMULATIVE REMEDIES; WAIVER
- --------------------------------------

     Section 9.1  Every term, condition, agreement or provision contained in
this Lease will also be deemed to be a covenant.

     Section 9.2  In addition to the other remedies provided in this Lease,
Landlord will be entitled to the restraint by injunction of any violation or
attempted or threatened violation of any of the terms or covenants of this
Lease. Landlord's remedies under the terms of this Lease are cumulative and are
not intended to be exclusive of any other remedies to which Landlord may be
lawfully entitled, at law or in equity, in case of any breach by Tenant of any
provision of this Lease.

     Section 9.3  The failure of Landlord to insist in any one or more cases
upon the strict performance of any of the terms or covenants of this Lease, or
to exercise any option herein contained, will not be construed as a waiver or a
relinquishment for the future of any such term or covenant. No waiver by
Landlord of any term or covenant of this Lease will be deemed to have been made
unless made in a writing signed by Landlord.

     Section 9.4  Neither the payment by Tenant nor acceptance by Landlord of
rent or any other payment, nor the acceptance by Landlord of performance of
anything required by this Lease to be performed, with the knowledge of the
breach of any term or covenant of this Lease, will be deemed a waiver of such
breach or of any of Landlord's rights hereunder. Landlord's acceptance of rent
or any other payment in a lesser amount than is due (regardless of any
endorsement on any check, or any statement in any letter accompanying any such
rent or payment) will not operate or be construed either as an accord and
satisfaction or in any manner other than as payment on account of the earliest
rent or other sums then unpaid.

     Section 9.5 Tenant waives all right to trial by jury in any proceeding
instituted with respect to this Lease,

ARTICLE 10. SURRENDER OF PREMISES
- ---------------------------------

     Section 10.1  Tenant will, upon the expiration or earlier termination of
this Lease, quit and surrender the Demised Premises to Landlord, together with
all Tenant Improvements and other alterations (unless Landlord elects otherwise
as hereinafter provided) and replacements thereof then on the Demised Premises,
in good order, condition and repair, except for reasonable wear and tear. Prior
to the expiration or earlier termination of this Lease, Tenant will remove all
of its property, equipment and trade fixtures from the Demised Premises without
damage, leaving the Demised Premises in broom-clean
<PAGE>
 
condition.  All property not removed by Tenant will be deemed abandoned by
Tenant and Landlord reserves the right to charge the cost of removal, storage
and/or disposal of same to Tenant.

     Section 10.2  If the Demised Premises is not surrendered at the end of the
Term or if the Demised Premises is damaged or is not in broom-clean condition,
except for reasonable wear and tear, upon surrender, Tenant will indemnify
Landlord against any loss or liability resulting, including, without limitation
and in addition to any other remedy or claim of Landlord's, any claims made or
damages sustained by any succeeding tenant founded on the delay, condition
and/or damage.

     Section 10.3  Tenant's obligations under this Article 10 will survive the
expiration or earlier termination of this Lease and surrender of the Demised
Premises.

ARTICLE 11. ASSIGNMENT OR SUBLETTING
- ------------------------------------

     Section 11.1 Tenant will neither assign this Lease, sublet the Demised
Premises or any part thereof nor encumber its interest in this Lease unless it
first complies with this Article 11.

     Section 11.2 Provided that (a) Tenant is not then in default of any of the
terms or conditions of this Lease, and (b) Landlord gives prior written consent
to the proposed assignment or subletting, Tenant will be entitled to sublet the
Demised Premises or a portion thereof, or to assign this Lease, but only in
accordance with and subject to the provisions of Section 11.3 below. Landlord
will have the right to withhold its consent if, in Landlord's sole and
unreviewable judgment, the reputation, financial responsibility, or business of
a proposed assignee or subtenant is unsatisfactory to Landlord, or if Landlord
deems such business to be incompatible with that of other tenants in the
Property, or if the business of the proposed assignee or subtenant would expose
the Demised Premises and/or Property and/or the occupants of the Property to
increased risk of danger or injury, including environmental contamination.

     Section 11.3 (a) If Tenant desires to assign this Lease or to sublet all or
part of the Demised Premises, it must, prior to entering into such assignment or
sublease, serve notice upon Landlord and Mortgagee of its intention to make such
assignment or subletting ("Tenant's Notice") which notice will contain (i) the
name and address of the proposed assignee or subtenant, (ii) the full and
complete terms and conditions of the assignment or subletting and, in the case
of subletting, the exact space to be sublet, (iii) the amount of rental and all
other consideration to be paid by the subtenant or assignee, (iv) the nature of
the proposed assignee's or subtenant's business and its proposed use of the
Demised Premises and (v) a copy of plans and, if available, specifications for
any required alterations to the Demised Premises. In the event that Landlord
or Mortgagee requires any additional or supplementary information, Landlord or
Mortgagee will advise Tenant, in writing, within twenty (20) days of
Landlord's receipt of Tenant's Notice and Tenant will supply same within a
reasonable time.

        (b) Landlord has the right by giving Tenant notice of its election to do
so ("Landlord's Notice") within fourteen (14) days after the later of receipt of
Tenant's Notice or receipt of the requested additional or supplementary
information, if applicable, either (i) to terminate this Lease as to all or that
portion of the Demised Premises which is the subject of the proposed assignment
or sublease, or (ii) to require as a condition to its consent to an assignment
or sublease that Tenant shall pay to Landlord one hundred (100%) percent of (A)
any consideration received by Tenant for the assignment or sublease and (B) the
amount by which the Base Rent, Operating expenses and other Additional Rent to
be paid under the sublease or assignment exceed the Base Rent, Operating
Expenses and other Additional Rent to be paid under this Lease. Such amounts
will be paid to Landlord as and when they are received by Tenant. In the event
of an election by Landlord to terminate this Lease as provided in (i) above,
such termination shall become effective on the commencement date of the proposed
sublease or the effective date of the proposed assignment, as the case may be,
but in no event earlier than thirty (30) days after the giving of Landlord's
Notice, and Base Rent and all Additional Rent payable by Tenant will be so
adjusted and apportioned as of the date of such termination.

        (c) Notwithstanding the foregoing, Tenant's right to make an assignment
or sublease and the
<PAGE>
 
effectiveness of any assignment or sublease is conditional upon (i) there being
no uncured default under the Lease as of the effective date of the assignment or
sublease and (ii) Tenant's delivery to Landlord, in recordable form and within
three (3) days after their execution, of a duplicate original of the assignment
or sublease and, in the event of an assignment, an agreement reasonably
acceptable to Landlord wherein the assignee assumes and agrees to keep, observe
and perform all of the covenants, conditions and obligations of Tenant under
this Lease.

     Section 11.4 If this Lease is assigned, or if the Demised Premises or any
part thereof is sublet or otherwise occupied by anyone other than Tenant, after
default by Tenant, Landlord may collect rent from the assignee, subtenant or
occupant and apply the net amount collected to the amounts due hereunder, but no
such assignment, subletting, occupancy or collection will be deemed a waiver of
this covenant, an acceptance of the assignee, subtenant or occupant as tenant or
a release of Tenant from further performance of the terms, covenants and
conditions of this Lease.

     Section 11.5  Notwithstanding any assignment, sublease or other occupancy,
with or without Landlord's consent, Tenant will remain primarily liable on this
Lease unless expressly agreed to by Landlord to the contrary, in writing. Any
violation of any provision of this lease, whether by act or omission, by any
assignee, subtenant or occupant, will be deemed a violation of such provision by
Tenant, it being the intention of the parties that Tenant will be liable to
Landlord for any and all acts and omissions of any and all assignees, subtenants
or other occupants of the Demised Premises.

     Section 11.6  For purposes of this Article 11, if Tenant is a corporation
or partnership, any dissolution, merger, consolidation or other reorganization
of such corporation or partnership, or the sale or other transfer or disposition
of a "controlling interest" in the corporate shares or partnership interests of
Tenant, as the case may be, (whether such sale, transfer or other disposition
occurs at one time or at intervals so that, in the aggregate, such sale,
transfer or other disposition of a "controlling interest" shall have occurred),
will be deemed to constitute an assignment of this Lease.  For the purposes of
this Article 11, the term "controlling interest" means (a) as to a tenant which
is a corporation, the ownership of shares possessing and having the right to
exercise more than fifty (50%) percent of the total combined voting power of all
classes of shares issued, outstanding and entitled to vote for the election of
directors, (whether direct ownership or indirect ownership through ownership of
shares possessing and having the right to exercise more than fifty (50%) percent
of the total combined voting power of all classes of shares of another
corporation or corporations), and (b) as to a tenant which is a partnership,
more than fifty (50%) percent of the partnership interests of the general
partners of such partnership (whether direct ownership or indirect ownership
through control of a corporate general partner).

     Section 11.7  Without limiting any of the provisions of this Article 11, if
pursuant to the United States Bankruptcy Code or any similar law having the same
general purpose (herein the "Code") Tenant is permitted to assign its interest
in this Lease notwithstanding the restrictions set forth above, Landlord will be
entitled to assurance of future performance by an assignee expressly permitted
under such Code which will be deemed to mean, at a minimum, the deposit of cash
or cash equivalent security in an amount equal to the sum of one (1) year's Base
Rent plus an amount equal to the Additional Rent for the calendar year preceding
the year in which such assignment is intended to become effective. Such security
will be held by Landlord for the balance of the Term, without interest, as
security for the full performance of all of Tenant's obligations under this
Lease, and may be applied in the manner specified in Article 17 below.

ARTICLE 12.  MAINTENANCE AND REPAIRS; COVENANT AGAINST WASTE; RIGHT OF
- ----------------------------------------------------------------------
INSPECTION
- ----------

     Section 12.1  Tenant will, at its sole cost and expense, maintain the
Demised Premises and all of its fixtures, systems, equipment and improvements,
in clean, safe, orderly and sanitary condition free of accumulation of dirt and
rubbish. Unless indicated to the contrary in the Agreement of Lease, Tenant will
perform its own janitorial service and will arrange for trash removal from the
Demised Premises at its cost and expense. Tenant will not permit or suffer any
overloading of the floors of the Demised Premises and will not do or suffer any
waste or injury with respect thereto. In case of any destruction or damage of
any kind whatsoever to the Demised Premises, or any part thereof or system
therein, including, without limitation, any glass and the Tenant Improvements in
or at the Demised Premises, Tenant shall repair said damage or destruction as
speedily as possible at Tenant's own cost and expense, provided, however, that
if any such damage or destruction results solely from the act, fault or
negligence of Landlord, or anyone acting under Landlord, when making
replacements pursuant to Section 12.2 or 12.4, then it will be the
responsibility of Landlord to make the repairs at its expense. Tenant will also
be responsible, at its own cost and expense, to (a) repair HVAC, electrical or
plumbing system(s) ("Tenant System") which service only the Demised Premises,
(b) maintain throughout the Term an HVAC maintenance contract, and, if requested
by Landlord, a maintenance contract on any other Tenant systems, covering any
such Tenant System(s) in such form and with such company as is approved by
Landlord, and (c) replace bulbs, starters and ballasts for lighting fixtures.
Landlord shall, upon reasonable notice from Tenant, repair HVAC, electrical or
plumbing systems serving the Demised Premises and other space leased or held for
lease by Landlord, in which event Tenant shall pay that portion of the cost of
such repairs equal to the same ratio that the rentable square footage of the
Demised Premises bears to the rentable square footage of the space (including
the Demised Premises) served by such system(s). When used in this Article, the
term "repair(s)" includes replacement(s), restoration(s), addition(s),
improvement(s), alteration(s) and/or renewal(s) when necessary. Prior to making
any repairs, Tenant will notify Landlord of the nature of the damage or
destruction and contractors Tenant intends to employ to effect the repairs. The
provisions and conditions of Article 14 applicable to changes or alterations
(including the condition that Landlord may require that the repairs be performed
by its agents, servants, employees or contractors) will similarly apply to
repairs required to be performed by Tenant under this Article. To the extent
that there are any warranties or guaranties applicable to the Demised Premises,
including the fixtures, equipment and systems therein, which would be
applicable to the obligations of Tenant under this Article 12, Landlord will
assign said warranties or guaranties to Tenant.

     Section 12.2  Landlord will be responsible for and will make all necessary
repairs to the bearing walls, foundation and roof of the Demised Property,
provided, however, that if any such repairs result from the act, fault or
negligence of Tenant, such repairs will be made by Landlord at Tenant's expense.

     Section 12.3 Upon prior reasonable notice (except in case of emergency when
notice will not be required), Tenant will permit Landlord and its authorized
representatives to enter the Demised Premises during usual business hours for
the purposes of (a) inspecting the same, (b) curing any defaults on the part of
Tenant in making any necessary repairs, (c) performing any work which may be
necessary to comply with any laws ordinances, rules, regulations, or
requirements of any public authority, or which may be necessary to prevent waste
or deterioration in connection with the Demised Premises and (d) exhibiting the
Demised Premises during the last year of the Term. Nothing in this Section 12.3
imposes any duty upon the part of Landlord to do any such work or to make any
repairs to the Demised Premises of any kind whatsoever, except as specifically
provided herein, and the performance thereof by Landlord will not constitute a
waiver of Tenant's default in failing to perform the same. Landlord will
promptly, after Tenant has given Landlord notice of the necessity therefor, make
all repairs required to be made hereunder by Landlord, provided, however, that
Landlord will not in any event be liable, nor will Tenant be entitled to any
abatement or setoff or deduction from rent, nor will the obligations of Tenant
under this Lease be affected in any manner whatsoever, for

                                    -6-
<PAGE>
 
inconvenience, annoyance, disturbance, loss of business or other damage of
Tenant or any other occupant of the Demised Premises, or any part thereof, by
reason of (i) making repairs, performing any work on the Demised Premises or any
noise, vibration or other disturbance, (ii) bringing materials, supplies and
equipment into or through the Demised Premises, or (iii) the Demised Premises
being rendered wholly or partially untenantable (collectively "Inconvenience")
because of Landlord's failure to make any repairs required to be made hereunder
by Landlord. Landlord will exercise due diligence not to interfere with Tenant's
business operation, but will not be required to employ overtime labor to avoid
such, interference, provided, however, Landlord will employ overtime labor, at
Tenant's expense, if requested to do so by Tenant.

     Section 12.4 (a) Tenant agrees Landlord may, at its sole discretion and at
any time or from time to time during the Term, perform structural and/or non-
structural renovation work on, in and/or to the Property, any of which work may
require access to the same from within the Demised Premises. Tenant will provide
such access at all reasonable times, upon reasonable notice (except in an
emergency), for the purpose of performing such work, and Landlord will incur no
liability to Tenant, nor will Tenant be entitled to any abatement of rent, on
account of any Inconvenience at the Demised Premises (provided that Tenant is
not denied access to said Demised Premises).

        (b) Landlord will use reasonable efforts (which will not include any
obligation to employ labor at overtime rates) to avoid disruption of Tenant's
business during any such entry upon the Demised Premises and agrees to use
overtime labor, if requested by Tenant, at Tenant's expense.

        (c) If Tenant commences any action or proceeding seeking injunctive,
declaratory or monetary relief in connection with the rights reserved so
Landlord under this Section, or if Landlord commences any action or proceeding
to obtain access to the Demised Premises in accordance with this Section, then
in either event if Landlord prevails in any such action or proceeding Tenant
will pay to Landlord, as Additional Rent, a sum equal to all of Landlord's
reasonable legal fees, costs and disbursements in any way related to or arising
out of such action or proceeding.

ARTICLE 13. MECHANIC'S LIENS
- ----------------------------

     Section 13.1 Tenant will not suffer or permit any lien or claim ("Lien") to
be created or to remain against the Demised Premises and/or Property or any part
thereof, by reason of any work, labor, services or materials performed or
supplied, or claimed to have been performed or supplied, for or to Tenant or any
contractor or subcontractor employed by Tenant or anyone holding the Demised
Premises or any part thereof through or under Tenant. If at any time a Lien is
filed against the Demised Premises and/or Property, Tenant will cause the same
to be discharged of record within 10 days after notice to Tenant of the filing
of same. If Tenant fails to discharge any such Lien within such period, then,
in addition to any other right or remedy of Landlord, Landlord may elect, but
shall not be obligated, either to procure the discharge of the Lien by bonding
or by payment or deposit into court of the amount claimed to be due, or to
compel the prosecution of an action for the foreclosure of such Lien by the
lienor and to pay the amount of the judgment, if any, in favor of the lienor
with interest and costs. Any amounts paid or deposited by Landlord for any of
the aforesaid purposes, and all legal and other expenses and disbursements of
Landlord, including reasonable counsel fees, in defending any action or in or
about procuring the discharge of such Lien, together with interest thereon at
the rate which Chemical Bank announces as its so called prime rate or base
rate, from time to time, plus 5%, from the date of payment or deposit, will
become due and payable forthwith by Tenant to Landlord, as Additional Rent.

     Section 13.2  Nothing in this Lease will be deemed or construed as the
consent of Landlord, express or implied, by inference or otherwise, to any
alteration or repair of or to the Demised Premises or any part thereof, or to
Tenant's contracting for or permitting the rendering of any services or the
<PAGE>
 
furnishing of any materials, which might give rise to the right to file any Lien
against Landlord's interest in the Demised Premises.

ARTICLE 14.  ALTERATIONS
- ------------------------

     Section 14.1  Tenant will not make, cause or permit any alterations,
additions or improvements ("alterations") in or to the Demised Premises without
in each instance obtaining Landlord's prior written consent thereto. By way of
illustration but not limitation, Landlord will be entitled to withhold its
consent if the proposed alterations (a) impair or affect the structural
soundness or integrity of the Demised Premises, the property or any of the
systems or equipment therein, (b) lessen the present or future value of the
Demised Premises or the Property, (c) change the type of use of the Demised
Premises; or (d) increase the risk of damage or injury to the Demised Premises
and/or the Property or the occupants of the Property. Any such consent by
Landlord may be upon condition that the work be performed by Landlord's agents,
servants, employees or contractors and that Tenant furnish to Landlord such
evidence of Tenant's financial ability to assure payment and/or completion as
Landlord may reasonably require. If Landlord so elects and notifies Tenant at
the time of Tenant's request to make such alterations, Tenant will, at its sole
cost and expense, remove any alterations (structural or non-structural) at the
expiration or other termination of this Lease, repair all damage caused by such
removal and restore the Demised Premises to the condition in which they were
prior to the installation of any such alterations. Nothing herein contained will
be construed to restrict Tenant's right to install or to make any changes in
Tenant's own movable trade fixtures or to qualify Landlord's obligation to make
structural replacements as provided in Section 12.2. The provisions of this
Article 14 are subject to the terms and conditions of any mortgage to which this
Lease is subordinate and if the consent of any such mortgagee is required for
such work, such consent will be obtained by Tenant before any such work is
commenced. In that regard, Landlord agrees to reasonably cooperate with Tenant
in obtaining the consent of such mortgagee.

     Plans and specifications for any proposed alterations will be submitted to
Landlord for approval upon the request for its consent, together with a
reputable contractor's (which may include a contractor in Tenant's employ)
estimate of the cost thereof. Upon completion of the alterations, Landlord is to
receive one print and one reproducible copy of the "as-built" construction
plans.

     Section 14.2 In making any alternation contemplated by this Article, or any
repair or restoration contemplated by other terms and conditions of this Lease,
the parties will comply with all applicable laws, regulations, ordinances and
orders and procure all requisite permits, all at Tenant's expense. Copies of
all such approvals, authorizations and permits will be delivered to and
retained by Landlord. Each party will, on written request from the other,
execute any documents necessary to be signed on its part in order to obtain
any such permit. All alterations made hereunder will be performed in a first-
class, good and workmanlike manner using new materials at least equivalent in
quality to those used in the construction of the Demised Premises. If the
alterations are not performed by Landlord or its agents, employees, servants
or contractors, Tenant shall require that each and every contractor,
subcontractor and supplier, prior to furnishing labor or materials to the
Demised Premises, file with the Prothonotary of Delaware County a written
waiver of its right to file a mechanic's lien against the Demised Premises and
Property, in form and substance satisfactory to Landlord. Landlord may impose
a reasonable charge for the supervision and inspection of the construction of
any alterations not performed by Landlord or its agents, employees, servants
or contractors.

     Section 14.3  All alterations (other than Tenant's trade fixtures) made by
Tenant will, upon termination of this Lease, immediately be and become the sole
and absolute property of Landlord and will remain upon and be surrendered with
the Demised Premises unless Landlord has elected as provided in Section 14.1
that such alterations be removed, in which event they will be removed by Tenant
and the Demised Premises restored to its original condition at Tenant's expense
upon or prior to the surrender of possession.

     Section 14.4  If Landlord, in its absolute discretion, determines that the
performance of any work to be completed by Tenant's contractor(s) interferes
with,

                                     -7-
<PAGE>
 
delays, hampers or prevents Landlord's contractor(s) from proceeding with
completion of its work in the Demised Premises, the premises of any other tenant
or the Common Facilities, Tenant will, at the earliest possible time within 24
hours after Landlord's determination (which need not be communicated in writing
and may be given orally by Landlord, its agents or contractors, to Tenant, or
its agents or contractors), cause its contractors to cease all work being
performed by it or on its behalf and to withdraw from the Demised Premises until
further notice from Landlord.

     To the end that there will be no labor dispute which would interfere with
the construction, completion or operation of the Common Facilities or the
Property, or any part of either, including, but not limited to, the Demised
Premises, Tenant agrees that for any work which Tenant performs, whether or not
such work is permitted or required pursuant to the Lease, Tenant will engage the
services of only such contractors and subcontractors as will work in harmony,
and without causing any labor dispute, with each other, with Landlord's
contractors and subcontractors and with the contractors and subcontractors of
all others working in or upon the Common Facilities or the Property, or any part
of either, and Tenant shall require its contractors and subcontractors to employ
only such labor as will work in harmony, and without causing labor dispute, with
all other labor then working in or upon the Common Facilities or the Property,
or any part of either.  Furthermore, only those contractors and subcontractors
as have been duly licensed by the authority having jurisdiction over the
appropriate profession and which have been approved in writing by Landlord may
perform any work for Tenant in or upon the Demised Premises.

     Section 14.5 Tenant will maintain, or cause Tenant's contractors to
maintain, worker's compensation and comprehensive general liability insurance
and property damage insurance, all in amounts, with companies and on forms
reasonably satisfactory to Landlord and on an occurrence basis. Such insurance
will be in effect at all times during any period of such contractor's entry upon
the Demised Premises and certificates of insurance will be delivered to Landlord
prior to any such entry by Tenant or Tenant's contractors. If required by
Landlord, such insurance will name Landlord and Landlord's contractor and/or
construction manager as additional insured(s), and in all cases will be primary
insurance not contributing with other insurance Landlord or its contractor
and/or construction manager may carry. Landlord will not in any way be liable
for any injury, loss, theft or damage which may occur to any supplies or
equipment of, or any decorations or installations made by, Tenant or Tenant's
contractors, the same being at the sole risk of Tenant and Tenant's contractors.

ARTICLE 15. INSURANCE; WAIVER OF SUBROGATION; RELEASE
- -----------------------------------------------------

     Section 15.1  During the term hereof, Tenant will, at its own cost and
expense, provide and keep in force the following insurance:

        (a) Comprehensive general liability insurance, with exclusions "a" and
"c" removed, written on an occurrence basis, naming Landlord and its agents and
employees as additional insureds, against claims for bodily injury, death or
property damage occurring in or about the Demised Premises and the Common
Facilities (including, without limitation, bodily injury, death or property
damage resulting directly or indirectly from or in connection with any
alteration, improvement or repair thereof made by or on behalf of Tenant), with
limits on an occurrence basis of not less than $3,000,000.00/$5,000,000.00 for
bodily injury or death and $1,000,000.00 for property damage or $5,000,000.00
combined single limit. Tenant's coverage must include (i) premises/operations,
(ii) independent contractors, and (iii) broad form contractual liability in
support of the indemnity provisions of Article 20. [To satisfy the liability
insurance requirements of this Section 15.1 under a policy of commercial general
liability insurance rather than comprehensive general liability insurance,
Tenant must obtain an endorsement which applies the aggregate limits separately
to the Premises (ISO Endorsement CG-25-05-11-85, Amendment--Aggregate Limits of
Insurance (Per Location) or an equivalent endorsement satisfactory to Landlord).
The
<PAGE>
 
certificate of insurance evidencing such policy must evidence that the limits of
Tenant's liability insurance required hereunder apply solely to the Demised
Premises and not to other locations.

        (b) Worker's Compensation in statutory amounts and employer's liability
of at least $100,000.00.

        (c) Insurance covering its contents and all Tenant Improvements, from
loss or damage from fire and casualty and, as to Tenant Improvements, such
coverage shall be all-risk special form insurance (or its equivalent) with
replacement cost and agreed amount endorsements naming Landlord as loss payee
and Mortgagee under a New York standard non-contributory Mortgagee endorsement
as their interests may appear.

        (d) Such other insurance as Landlord or any mortgagee may reasonably
require from time to time.

     Section 15.2 All policies will be obtained by Tenant and copies of same or,
at Landlord's option, certificates evidencing coverage will be delivered to
Landlord at or before the Commencement Date. All insurance will be written by
companies with a Best's rating of not less than A+, satisfactory to Landlord and
Mortgagee and authorized to do business in the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania. All
policies will be for periods of not less than one year and contain a provision
whereby the same cannot be canceled or materially altered unless Landlord is
given at least thirty (30) days prior written notice of such cancellation.
Tenant will procure and pay for renewals of such insurance from time to time and
promptly deliver to Landlord certificates thereof at least thirty (30) days
before the expiration thereof. All such insurance will be primary insurance not
contributing with other insurance Landlord or its contractor and/or construction
manager may carry.

     Section 15.3  All policies of insurance to be obtained pursuant to this
Article 15 and all other policies which Landlord or Tenant may carry which
affect, relate or pertain to the Demised Premises, the Common Facilities or any
of Tenant's contents, the Tenant improvements, fixtures and property must
include a waiver by the insurer of all rights of subrogation. Neither Landlord,
Tenant, nor any of their respective agents, officers, employees or invitees will
be liable to the other for, and each hereby expressly releases or waives any
claim for, loss or damage caused by any risk covered by a so-called all-risk
special form insurance policy (or its equivalent) or a commercial or
comprehensive general liability policy, as applicable, without regard to whether
such coverage is in effect. Such release and waiver shall include any such risk
as to which a party elects to self -insure, in whole or in part, by virtue of
any applicable deductible provisions of any insurance coverage or otherwise.
Moreover, Tenant expressly waives and releases Landlord from any claim for any
loss or damage to its business, contents, fixtures and/or property, whether or
not such loss or damage results from the negligence of Landlord, its agents,
officers, employees and/or invitees. If the release of Landlord as set forth
in this Section contravenes any law with respect to exculpatory agreements,
the liability of Landlord will not be deemed released but will be secondary to
the other's insurer.

     Section 15.4 Landlord will maintain fire and casualty insurance on the
Property (all-risk special form or its equivalent) and such other insurance as
Landlord or Mortgagee deems necessary to protect adequately the interest of
Landlord or Mortgagee.

ARTICLE 16. QUIET ENJOYMENT
- ---------------------------

     Section 16.1  Landlord covenants that so long as this Lease is in effect
and Tenant pays the rents and performs the covenants and conditions contained in
this Lease, Tenant may peacefully hold and enjoy the Demised Premises during the
Term subject, however, to the terms of this Lease.

ARTICLE 17. SECURITY DEPOSIT
- ----------------------------

     Section 17.1  Simultaneously with the execution of this Lease, Tenant will
deposit with Landlord the Security Deposit (which will not bear interest to
Tenant unless required to do so by any provision of law) as security for
Tenant's faithful and timely payment and performance by Tenant of all of
Tenant's obligations, covenants, conditions and agreements under this Lease.
Within a reasonable time after the expiration of the Term, Landlord will return
the Security Deposit to Tenant, less such portion thereof as Landlord has
utilized to make good any failure by Tenant to comply with any of Tenant's
obligations, covenants, conditions or agreements hereunder.

     Section 17.2 In the event of any default by

                                     -8-
<PAGE>
 
Tenant hereunder, Landlord has the right, but is not obligated, to apply all or
any portion of the Security Deposit to cure each default, in which event Tenant
will, upon demand, promptly deposit with Landlord the amount necessary to
restore the Security Deposit to its original amount.

     Section 17.3 The Security Deposit will be held by Landlord and may be
commingled with its other funds. In the event of sale or transfer of Landlord's
interest in the Building, Landlord has the right to transfer the Security
Deposit to such purchaser or transferee, in which event Landlord will, upon such
transfer, be released from all liability to Tenant for the return of the
Security Deposit. Tenant will look only to the new landlord for the return of
the Security Deposit.

ARTICLE 18. DAMAGE OR DESTRUCTION
- ---------------------------------

     Section 18.1 In case of any damage to or destruction of the Demised
Premises, or any part hereof, Tenant will promptly give written thereof to
Landlord.

     Section 18.2 If the Demised Premises is partially or totally damaged or
destroyed by fire or other cause, then, whether or not the damage or destruction
resulted from the fault or neglect of Tenant (and if this Lease has not been
terminated as hereinafter provided in this Article 18), Landlord will repair the
damage and restore and rebuild the Demised Premises (which for purposes of this
Article 18 shall include the Tenant improvements), at its expense, with
reasonable dispatch after notice to Landlord of the damage or destruction,
provided, however, that Landlord will not be required to repair or replace any
of Tenant's property.

     Section 18.3 If the Demised Premises is partially damaged or partially
destroyed by fire or other cause, the rents payable hereunder will be abated to
the extent that the Demised Premises has been rendered unusable to Tenant in the
conduct of its business and for the period from the date of such damage or
destruction to the date the damage has been repaired or restored. If the Demised
Premises or a major part thereof has been totally (which shall be deemed to
include substantially) damaged or destroyed or rendered completely unusable to
Tenant in the conduct of its business on account of fire or other cause, the
rents shall completely abate as of the date of the damage or destruction and
until Landlord repairs, restores and rebuilds the Demised Premises, provided,
however, that if Tenant reoccupies a portion of the Demised Premises for the
conduct of Tenant's business during the time that the restoration work is taking
place and prior to the date that the same are made completely tenantable, rents
allocable to such portion will be payable by Tenant from the date of such
occupancy.

     Section 18.4  In case of any damage or destruction mentioned in this
Article 18, Landlord may terminate this Lease, by notice to Tenant, if the
Demised Premises and/or the portion of the Property in which the Demised
Premises are located are not reasonably capable of restoration within one
hundred eighty (180) days. Within thirty (30) days after such fire or
casualty, Landlord will advise Tenant in writing as to whether or not it can
restore the Premises within the one hundred eighty (180) day period referred
to above, and whether or not it elects to terminate this Lease as provided in
this Section 18.4. If Landlord elects not to terminate the Lease, then
Landlord will have two hundred ten (210) days from receipt of Tenant's notice
of such damage to restore the Demised Premises.

     Section 18.5 Provided that Landlord diligently prosecutes such repair and
restoration, Landlord will have no liability if the time for repair or
restoration extends beyond the two hundred ten (210) day period. During any
period of restoration, Tenant will be responsible for the security of its goods,
fixtures and equipment and will be responsible at its cost and expense to remove
same from the damaged Demised Premises pending restoration if necessary, it
being understood and agreed that Landlord will have no responsibility or
liability with respect thereto if the same remain in the damaged area.

     Section 18.6  Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein,
Landlord's obligation to repair will not extend to the Tenant Improvements
<PAGE>
 
unless Tenant makes available to Landlord the funds to pay for the cost of such
repairs, and Landlord's repairs will not exceed the scope of the work required
to be done by Landlord at the outset of this Lease, if any, as set forth in
Exhibit C. Furthermore, should the damage or destruction occur during the last
year of the Term, then notwithstanding any contrary provision continued herein,
Landlord will have the option of not repairing the Demised Premises. Landlord
must give Tenant notice of its election not to repair within thirty (30) days of
receipt of Tenant's notice of the damage or destruction or such option will be
deemed terminated.

     Section 18.7  No damages, compensation or claim will be payable by Landlord
for Inconvenience, loss of business or otherwise arising from any repair or
restoration of any portion of the Demised Premises or of the portion of the
Property in which the Demised Premises are located pursuant to this Article.
Landlord will use reasonable and diligent efforts to effect such repair or
restoration promptly and in such manner as not to unreasonably interfere with
Tenant's use and occupancy.

     Section 18.8  Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein,
Landlord's obligations to repair the damage and restore and rebuild the Demised
Premises and the portion of the Property in which the Demised Premises are
located pursuant to this Article will be contingent upon its obtaining all
necessary approvals from the applicable governmental authorities, all necessary
consents from mortgagees or ground lessors and sufficient proceeds from
insurance policies.

ARTICLE 19. CONDEMNATION
- ------------------------

     Section 19.1  If, at any time during the Term of this Lease, title to the
whole or materially all of the portion of the Property in which the Demised
Premises are located and/or Demised Premises is taken by the exercise of the
right of condemnation or eminent domain (hereinafter referred to as the
"proceedings") or by agreement between Landlord and those authorized to exercise
such right, this Lease will terminate and expire on the date of such taking, all
Base Rent and Additional Rent provided to be paid by Tenant will be apportioned
and paid to the date of such taking, and the total award made in such
proceedings will be paid to Landlord. For the purpose of this Article 19,
"materially all of the portion of the Property in which the Demised Premises are
located and/or Demised Premises" will be deemed to have been taken if, as a
result of the taking, the premises remaining after such taking are not
reasonably usable for Tenant's business purposes. Any dispute as to whether the
premises are reasonably usable for Tenant's business purposes will be settled by
arbitration to be held in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania in accordance with the
rules of the American Arbitration Association then in effect. Judgment may be
entered on the arbitrator's determination in any court having jurisdiction and
the parties consent to the jurisdiction of the Common Pleas Court of
Pennsylvania for this purpose.

     Section 19.2 If, at any time during the Term of this Lease, title to less
than materially all of the portion of the Property in which the Demised Premises
are located and/or Demised Premises is taken as aforesaid (a"Partial
Condemnation"), the entire award will be paid to Landlord, and Landlord will
have the option to (a) restore the portion of the Property in which the Demised
Premises are located and/or Demised Premises to an architecturally and/or
functionally complete unit with reasonable promptness, subject to ordinary
delays beyond Landlord's control, provided that after such restoration the
Demised Premises as restored is sufficient to meet Tenant's needs, or (b)
terminate this Lease. Landlord will exercise its option to cancel by written
notice to Tenant to be given not more than forty-five (45) days from the date of
such Partial Condemnation and this Lease will become null and void ninety (90)
days after said notice.

     Section 19.3 If title to less than materially all of the portion of the
Property in which the Demised Premises are located and/or Demised Premises is
taken as aforesaid and this Lease continues, the Base Rent and any additional
Rent will be reduced to an amount equivalent to the proportionate square footage
of the Demised Premises.

     Section 19.4  Tenant further agrees that if, at any time after the date
hereof, the whole or any part of the portion of the Property in which the
Demised Premises are located and/or Demised Premises is taken or condemned by
any competent authority for its temporary use or occupancy (herein a "Taking"),
this Lease will not terminate by reason thereof and Tenant will continue to pay,
in the manner and at the time herein specified, the

                                    -9-
<PAGE>
 
full amount of the Base Rent and all Additional Rent payable by Tenant
hereunder, and, except only to the extent that Tenant may be prevented from so
doing pursuant to the terms of the order of the condemning authority, to perform
and observe all of the other terms, covenants, conditions and obligations hereof
upon the part of Tenant to be performed and observed, as though such Taking had
not occurred. In the event of any such Taking, Tenant will be entitled to
receive the entire amount of any award made for such Taking applicable to the
Demised Premises, whether paid by way of damages, rent or otherwise (except that
if the award is made in a lump sum, the award will be held by Landlord and paid
out to Tenant in equal monthly installments), except that portion of the award
attributable to or for restoration, if any, which will be held by and belong to
Landlord, provided, however, if such period of temporary use or occupancy shall
extend beyond the expiration date or termination of this Lease, such award shall
be apportioned between Landlord and Tenant as of such date of expiration or
termination of the Term. If the period of temporary use or occupancy ends during
the Term of this Lease, Tenant will, at its sole cost and expense, restore the
Demised Premises as nearly as practicable to the condition of the same is
immediately prior to the Taking, and if the period of temporary use or occupancy
does not end during the Term of this Lease, Landlord will be entitled to the
portion of the award that  is attributable to restoration of the Demised
Premises.

     Section 19.5  Except as expressly provided in the preceding Sections of
this Article, Tenant will neither have nor make any claim whatsoever for any
award or payment for the Demised Premises or any part thereof, and in any event
Tenant shall neither have nor make any claim whatsoever for any award or payment
for the value of Tenant's leasehold under this Lease or the value of the
unexpired portion of the Term of this Lease.  Nothing herein shall preclude
Tenant from the right to recover for direct loss of its personal property or
trade fixtures or for relocation expenses, if applicable.

ARTICLE 20. INDEMNIFICATION
- ---------------------------

     Section 20.1  Tenant covenants and agrees, at its sole cost and expense and
in addition to any other right or remedy of Landlord hereunder, to indemnify and
save harmless Landlord and/or Mortgagee from and against any and all loss, cost,
expense and liability from claims by any third party(ies) (but excluding any
liability arising solely out of the negligence of Landlord or its agents,
employees or contractors), including, without limitation, reasonable attorneys'
fees and court costs, arising from or in connection with Tenant's occupancy and
control of the Demised Premises or Common Facilities, the conduct or management
of any work, or any act or omission whatsoever, done in or on the Demised
Premises by or under the direction or at the request of Tenant, any breach or
default on the part of Tenant in the payment of any rent or performance of any
covenant or agreement on the part of Tenant to be performed pursuant to the
terms of this Lease, or any act or negligence of Tenant or any of its agents,
contractors, servants, employees, licensees or invitees.

     Section 20.2  In the event that any action or proceeding is brought against
Landlord and/or Mortgagee by reason of any claims covered by the foregoing
indemnity, Tenant will, upon notice from Landlord and/or Mortgagee, resist or
defend such action or proceeding by counsel reasonably satisfactory to Landlord
and/or Mortgagee. Landlord and/or Mortgagee will not defend such action or
proceeding so long as Tenant is diligently doing so. Landlord and/or Mortgagee
will give prompt notice to Tenant of any action or proceeding brought against
Landlord and/or Mortgagee by reason of any claims covered by the foregoing
indemnity, together with copies of any documents served on Landlord and/or
Mortgagee in connection therewith, and Landlord and/or Mortgagee will not settle
any such claim without Tenant's written consent.

ARTICLE 21. SELF-HELP
- ----------------------

     Section 21.1  Tenant covenants and agrees that if it at any time fails to
take any payments or perform any act which it is obligated to make or perform
under this Lease, then Landlord may, but will not be obligated to, after
Tenant's time to make any
<PAGE>
 
such payment or perform any such act as provided in this Lease has expired and
any required notice has been given, and without waiving or releasing Tenant from
any of its obligations under this Lease, make any such payment or perform any
such act in such manner and to such extent as is necessary and consistent with
Tenant's obligations hereunder. In exercising any such rights, Landlord may pay
or incur costs and expenses, including, without limitation, reasonable
attorneys' fees. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Landlord may make any such
payment or perform any such act before Tenant's time to do so (as provided in
Article 8) has expired, if payment or performance of the same is necessary or
required prior to the expiration of the applicable grace period for the
preservation or protection of the Property and/or Demised Premises.

     Section 21.2  All sums so paid or incurred in connection with the
performance of any such act by Landlord, together with interest thereon from the
date that Landlord made such expenditure at the rate of five (5%) percent above
the rate which CoreStates Bank, N.A. announces as its so-called prime rate or
base rate, from time to time, or the maximum rate allowed by law, whichever is
less, will be deemed Additional Rent hereunder and, except as otherwise in this
Lease expressly provided, will be payable to Landlord on demand or, at the
option of Landlord, may be added to any Rent then due or thereafter becoming due
under this Lease.

ARTICLE 22. ESTOPPEL CERTIFICATE
- --------------------------------

     Section 22.1  Tenant agrees that at any time and from time to time, within
ten (10) days of the receipt of written request by Landlord, it will execute,
acknowledge and deliver a statement in writing certifying (a) that this Lease is
unmodified and in full force and effect, or if there have been modifications
that the same is in full force and effect as modified and stating the
modification, (b) the dates to which the Base Rate, Additional Rent and other
charges have been paid and the amount of same, and (c) to the best knowledge of
the certifying party whether there are any defaults or rent abatements or
offsets claimed. Notwithstanding the foregoing, it is intended that any such
statement delivered pursuant to this Article may be relied upon by any
prospective purchaser or mortgagee or assignee of any mortgage of Landlord's
interest in the Demised Premises and/or Property and the statement will contain
such other information as is requested, and be in the form required, by such
purchaser, mortgagee or assignee.

     Section 22.2  The failure of Tenant to execute, acknowledge and deliver to
Landlord a written instrument in accordance with the provisions of this Article
within the ten (10) day period above provided shall constitute an
acknowledgement by Tenant, which may be relied upon by any mortgagee or
prospective purchaser or mortgagee or assignee of any mortgage of Landlord's
interest in the Demised Premises and/or Property or of any interest therein,
of the matters set forth in Section 22.1 as well as such other facts and
conditions as shall have been requested to be certified, and shall constitute,
as to any person entitled to rely as aforesaid, a waiver or any defaults which
may exist prior to the date of such request. Notwithstanding the foregoing,
Tenant's failure to furnish such written instrument within the time period
provided herein after Landlord's request therefor, shall constitute a default
under this Lease.

ARTICLE 23. SUBORDINATION AND NON-DISTURBANCE

     Section 23.1 This Lease is and will at all times be subject and subordinate
to the lien of any mortgage(s) now or hereafter made on or affecting the
Property or any part thereof, and all renewals, modifications, consolidations,
replacements, or extensions thereof, irrespective of the time of recording such
mortgage(s). The provisions of this subordination shall be automatic and no
further instrument of subordination will be necessary, but in confirmation of
this subordination Tenant will, at Landlord's request, execute and deliver such
further instruments as may be required by the holder(s) of said mortgage(s).

     Section 23.2  If any mortgagee or any other person claiming by or through
any mortgagee, or by or through any foreclosure proceeding or sale in lien of
foreclosure, succeeds to the rights of Landlord under this Lease, Tenant will,
at the request of such successor or at Landlord's request, attorn to and
recognize such successor as the landlord of Tenant under this Lease, and Tenant
will promptly execute, acknowledge and deliver at any time any instruments
requested by such person to evidence such attornment and/or confirm Tenant's
agreement

                                     -1-
<PAGE>
 
to attorn. Upon such attornment, this Lease will continue as a direct lease from
such successor landlord to Tenant, upon and subject to all of the provisions of
this Lease for the remainder of the Term, except that the successor landlord
will not be:

        (a) liable for any previous act or omission of Landlord under this
Lease;
        (b) subject to any offset not expressly provided for in this Lease which
has theretofore accrued to Tenant against Landlord;

        (c) bound by (i) any modification of this Lease after the date of such
mortgage, or (ii) any prepayment of more than one (1) month's Base Rent or
Additional Rent, unless same has been expressly approved in writing by the
holder of such mortgage through or by reason of which the successor landlord
shall have succeeded to the rights of Landlord under this Lease;

        (d)  bound by any security deposit which Tenant may have paid to any
prior landlord, unless such deposit is in an escrow fund available to mortgagee,
or actually received by mortgagee;

        (e) bound by any provision in the Lease which obligates Landlord to
erect or complete any building or to perform any construction work or to make
any improvements to the Demised Premises or to expand or rehabilitate any
existing improvements or to restore any improvements following any casualty or
taking;

        (f) bound by any notice of termination given by Landlord to Tenant
without such mortgagee's written consent thereto; or

        (g) personally liable under the Lease and any mortgagee's liability
under the Lease shall be limited to the ownership interest of mortgagee in the
Demised Premises and/or the Property.

        Tenant will further agree with such mortgagee that Tenant will not
voluntarily subordinate the Lease to any lien or encumbrance without such
mortgagee's prior written consent.

ARTICLE 24.  NOTICES
- --------------------

     Section 24.1  Except as expressly provided in this Lease to the contrary,
all notices, demands and requests (other than invoices for Base Rent or
Additional Rent) which are required to be given by either party to the other
will be in writing and will be sent by United States first class certified mail,
return receipt requested, addressed (a) to Landlord at its address set forth in
the Agreement of Lease, "Attention:  Vice President - Asset Management", (b) to

from time to time designate in a written notice to the other party. Until Tenant
takes occupancy of the Demised Premises, notices to Tenant shall be at
Tenant's address as set forth in the Agreement of Lease.

     Section 24.2  Notice is deemed to be given upon receipt, provided, however,
that in the event a party refuses to accept delivery of said certified mail, the
notice will nevertheless be deemed to be given upon the date of refusal to
accept delivery, and further provided that if the postal service is unable to
deliver said certified mail the notice will nevertheless be deemed to be given
as of the date of the postal service's second notice of attempted delivery.
Notwithstanding the above, a notice of change of address will not be effective
until received.

     Section 24.3  Either party may, at its option, substitute for service by
United States first class certified mail, service by Federal Express or similar
overnight courier, provided that such courier obtains and makes available to its
customers written evidence of delivery. Notice given via such courier is deemed
to be given upon receipt or upon refusal to accept delivery, as applicable.
Notices may be given by a party or by an agent or attorney for a party on its
behalf.

ARTICLE 25. BROKER
- ------------------

     Section 25.1  Landlord and Tenant represent to each other that they dealt
with no broker in connection with this Lease other than the Broker identified in
the Agreement of Lease.

     Section 25.2 Tenant agrees that if any claim should be made for commissions
by any broker by reason of any act of Tenant or its representatives, Tenant will
hold Landlord free and harmless from any and all loss, liabilities and expenses
in connection

                                    -10-
<PAGE>
 
therewith.  Landlord will give prompt notice to Tenant after any such claim is
made by any broker. Tenant will have the right to defend such claim and Landlord
will not pay or settle such claim as long as Tenant is defending same.

     Section 25.3 Landlord agrees that if any claims should be made for
commissions by any broker by reason of any act of Landlord or its
representatives, Landlord will hold Tenant free and harmless from any and all
loss, liabilities and expenses in connection therewith. Tenant will give prompt
notice to Landlord after any such claim is made by any such broker. Landlord
will have the right to defend such claim and Tenant will not pay or settle such
claim as long as Landlord is defending same.

ARTICLE 26. SIGNS
- -----------------

     Section 26.1 Tenant will comply with Landlord's criteria governing tenant
signage. Tenant will not place any signs on the land, or the exterior or
interior of the Demised Premises, or in any window whereby such sign would be
visible from the outside of the building in which the Demised Premises is
located, except as agreed to in writing by Landlord. Tenant will obtain, at its
sole cost and expense, any and all permits, licenses or approvals which may be
necessary in connection with its sign or signs.

ARTICLE 27. HOLDOVER
- --------------------

     Section 27.1  If Tenant continues in occupancy of the Demised Premises
after the expiration or sooner termination of the Term, such occupancy will be
deemed to be an event of default by Tenant (without the necessity of any
notice). Tenant's occupancy will be deemed a month-to-month tenancy subject to
the terms of the Lease and Tenant will pay twice the Base Rent in effect upon
the expiration of the Term together with twice the Additional Rent herein
provided. The provisions of this Article will not be construed (a) to relieve
Tenant from liability to Landlord for damages resulting from any such holding
over, or (b) as Landlord's consent for Tenant to hold over.

ARTICLE 28. LIMITATION OF LIABILITY
- -----------------------------------

     Section 28.1 Notwithstanding any contrary provision contained in this
Lease, neither Landlord, nor any of its officers, directors, principals,
partners, agents or employees, will be responsible or liable to Tenant:

        (a) for any damage or injury resulting from acts or omissions of persons
occupying or using any other part of the Property or for any injury or damage
resulting from bursting, stoppage or leakage of water, sprinkler, gas, sewer or
steam pipes; or

        (b) for any consequential damages or lost profits, under any
circumstances whatsoever; or

        (c) with respect to any of the provisions of this Lease.

        Notwithstanding the provisions of this Section, if Landlord is in
default with respect to its obligations hereunder and is thereby or otherwise
determined to be liable to Tenant (whether as a result of negligence, strict
liability, breach of warranty or any other theory or concept of liability),
Landlord will be liable for monetary damages only and as of the date such cause
of action occurs, following a final judgment establishing such default or
liability. In any such event, Tenant will look solely to the equity of Landlord
in the Property for the satisfaction of Tenant's remedies or Landlord's
liability and it is expressly understood and agreed that Landlord's liability
under the terms, covenants, warranties and obligations of this Lease or
otherwise, will in no event exceed the loss of its equity in the Property, or
extend personally to any principal, partner or officer, director, agent or
employee, as applicable, of Landlord.

attached hereto as Exhibit E. In addition, Tenant, its agents, employees,
contractors, licensees and invitees will abide by and observe such modified or
new rules or regulations as may be promulgated from time to time by Landlord for
the operation and maintenance of the Property, provided, however, that a copy of
same are sent to Tenant and that the same are in conformity with common practice
and usage in similar properties and are not inconsistent with the provisions of
this Lease. Nothing contained in this Lease will be construed to impose upon
Landlord any duty or obligation to enforce such rules and regulations, or the

                                   -11-
<PAGE>
 
terms, conditions or covenants contained in any other lease, as against any
other tenant, and Landlord will not be liable to Tenant for violation of the
same by any other tenant, its employees, agents, contractors, licensees or
invitees. If there is any inconsistency between this Lease and the Rules and
Regulations set forth in Exhibit D, the terms of this Lease will govern.

ARTICLE 31. REGULATION OR COMMON FACILITIES
- -------------------------------------------

     Section 31.1  The Common Facilities are at all times subject to the
exclusive control and management of Landlord. Landlord will have the right to

Demised Premises); to enter into, modify and terminate easements and other
agreements pertaining to the use and maintenance of the parking areas and other
Common Facilities; to restrict parking by tenants, their officers, agents, and
employees to employee parking areas; to construct parking areas and facilities;
to establish and change the level of parking surfaces; to close all or any
portion of the parking areas or other Common Facilities to such extent as may,
in the opinion of Landlord, be necessary to prevent a dedication thereof or the
accrual of any rights to any person or to the public therein; to close
temporarily any or all portions of the said areas or facilities to discourage
non-tenant parking; and to do and perform such other acts in and to the Common
Facilities as, in the exercise of good business judgment, Landlord may determine
to be advisable.

     Section 31.2  Landlord reserves any and all rights not expressly granted to
Tenant hereunder, including, but not limited to, the following rights which are

right to assign this Lease other than pursuant to the provisions hereof. It is
understood that the term "Landlord" as used in this Lease means only the owner,
a mortgagee in possession, or a ground lessee of the Demised Premises, so that
in the event of any sale of the Demised Premises or the building in which the
Demised Premises is located or of any ground lease thereof, or if a mortgagee
takes possession of the Demised Premises or the building in which the Demised
Premises is located, the Landlord named herein will be and hereby is entirely
freed and relieved of all covenants and obligations of Landlord hereunder
accruing thereafter, and it will be deemed, without further agreement, that the
purchaser, the ground lessee of the Demised Premises or the building in which
the Demised Premises is located, or the mortgagee in possession has assumed and
agreed to carry out any and all covenants and obligations of
<PAGE>
 
landlord hereunder accruing from and after the date of transfer, lease or

representatives, and (c) may not be modified except by an instrument in writing
which is signed by both parties.

ARTICLE 36. MISCELLANEOUS
- --------------------------

of this Lease are deemed to be severable. If any clause or provision herein
contained is adjudged to be invalid or unenforceable by a court of competent
jurisdiction or by operation of any applicable law or regulation, it will not
affect the validity of any other clause or provision herein, but such other
clauses or provisions will remain in full force and effect. In addition,
Landlord may pursue the relief or remedy sought in any invalid clause, by
conforming such clause with the provisions of the statute or regulation as if
the particular provisions of the applicable statute or regulation were set forth
herein at length.

     Section 36.2  This Lease is not to be strictly construed against either
Landlord or Tenant. No remedy or election given by any provision in this Lease
is deemed inclusive unless so indicated, but each, wherever possible, is
cumulative with all other remedies in law or at equity.

     Section 36.3  All obligations of Tenant which by their nature involve
performance in any particular, or which, cannot be ascertained to have been
fully performed until after the end of the Term, will survive the expiration or
sooner termination of this Lease.

     Section 36.4  Intentionally omitted.

     Section 36.5  This Lease is to be interpreted, governed by and enforced in
accordance with the substantive law of the State in which the Property is

less than thirty (30) days notice to Tenant, Landlord will have the right to
move Tenant out of the Demised Premises and into substantially similar space of
at least equal area, in the building in which the Demised Premises are located,
or a comparable building owned by Landlord, or any of its affiliates, in the
Property. In such event Landlord will remove, relocate and reinstall Tenant's
equipment, furniture and fixtures and redecorate the new space similar to the
old space, all of which shall be done at Landlord's sole cost and expense,
whereupon this Lease shall continue in full force and effect and shall apply to
the new space as though this Lease had originally been for such new space for
the balance of the Term.

     Section 38.2  Provided no default exists hereunder and subject to the same
rights granted to Tenants under leases for space in the building prior to the
date hereof, at the end of the third lease year and upon written notice to
Landlord, Tenant shall have the right to move out of the Demised Premises and
into space of at least 9,000 square feet at Tinicum Industrial Park, at Tenant's
sole cost and expense, whereupon Tenant shall pay no penalty for the unamortized
portion of Tenant's improvements, and Tenant and Landlord shall enter into a new
Agreement of Lease.

ARTICLE 39. REMOVAL OF TRASH
- ----------------------------

     Section 39.1 If the Agreement of Lease provides that Landlord shall remove
trash, Tenant shall place all trash in dumpsters outside the building in which
the Demised Premises are located at designated areas approved by Landlord in
writing. Landlord shall remove trash at such regular intervals as are necessary
to keep trash from overflowing the dumpsters.

     Section 39.2 If the Agreement of Lease provides that Tenant shall remove
trash, Tenant shall arrange to dispose of same outside the Property in
compliance with all applicable laws and regulation and at

     -1:
<PAGE>
 
such regular intervals as are necessary to keep trash from overflowing the
dumpsters designated for Tenant's use.

     Section 39.3  If Tenant utilizes dumpsters on the Property other than the
dumpsters approved by Landlord for Tenant's use, Tenant will be deemed to have
leased same from Landlord at the then-current fair market rental value thereof
and shall pay such rental value to Landlord on demand as Additional Rent.

ARTICLE 40. RIGHT OF FIRST OFFER
- --------------------------------

     Section 40.1  Provided no default exists hereunder and subject to the same
rights granted to tenants under leases for space in the Building prior to the
date hereof, Landlord shall notify Tenant in writing promptly after Landlord
becomes aware that adjacent space in the Building will become available for
lease of the date of availability of such adjacent space, together with the
location thereof and the terms and conditions on which Landlord proposes to
lease such adjacent space. Within five (5) business days after Tenant's receipt
of such notice, Tenant shall advise Landlord in writing whether it intends to
lease such adjacent space and Tenant's failure to so notify Landlord shall be
deemed a waiver of Tenant's right to lease such adjacent space at such time.

OPERATING EXPENSES
- ------------------

    1.  During the Term of this Lease Tenant shall pay to Landlord Tenant's Pro
Rata Share of "Operating Expenses" and "Real Estate Taxes" as defined below.

    2. (a) "Operating Expenses" are defined as any and all costs and expenses
incurred by Landlord relating or pertaining to the Property and deemed by
Landlord to be reasonable, appropriate and for the best interests of the
Property, including, but not limited to, the cost of: (i) gas, oil, electricity,
steam, water and other utilities (excluding tenants' electricity); (ii)
installing, operating, maintaining, repairing and replacing any part or parts
of, and/or providing Common Facilities, utilities, services, lighting,
mechanical and electrical equipment (including heating, ventilation and air-
conditioning equipment) and similar items which are or will be utilized to
provide services and utilities; (iii) maintenance, repair, lighting, cleaning,
painting, stripping, decorating, policing, management, superintendence and
security; (iv) insurance of any nature maintained by Landlord; (v) removal of
snow, ice and debris, regulation of traffic, inspection of machinery and
equipment and personal property taxes and other charges incurred in connection
with such machinery and equipment; (vi) replacement of paving, curbs, walkways,
planters and maintaining any lawns and/or plantings; (vii) management fee; and
(viii) any and all other expenses paid by Landlord in the operation, maintenance
and repair of the Property except as otherwise expressly excluded herein.

        (b) Operating Expenses will not include: (i) any expenses for which
Landlord is reimbursed or indemnified (either by an insurer, condemnor, tenant
or otherwise); (ii) interest or amortization payments on any mortgage or
mortgages, and rental under any ground or underlying lease or leases; or (iii)
the cost of any work or services performed for or facilities furnished to a
tenant at the tenant's cost. Operating Expenses will include the cost of any
capital improvement made to the Property after the date hereof which reduces
other Operating Expenses of the Property or is required under a law or
regulation that was not applicable to the Property at the time it was
constructed, the cost thereof to be amortized over a reasonable period (not to
exceed ten (10) years) together with interest on the unamortized balance at the
rate being paid by Landlord for funds borrowed for the purposes of constructing
said capital improvements (or
<PAGE>
 
the rate at which Landlord then customarily borrows funds for similar
expenditures if no funds were so borrowed). Operating Expenses will also include
capital expenses necessitated by casualties to the extent not covered by
insurance, including any deductible feature of any insurance carried by Landlord
with respect thereto.

        (c) "Real Estate Taxes" are defined as the annual real estate taxes,
payments "in lieu" of real estate taxes, assessments (whether general or special
and including all assessments for public improvements or benefits) or other
rents, rates and charges, excises, levies, license fees, permit fees, inspection
fees and other authorization fees and charges, in each case whether general or
special, which are levied or assessed against the Property. Real Estate Taxes
will not include income, franchise, inheritance or foreign ownership or foreign
control taxes (but Tenant will at all times be responsible for any taxes levied,
assessed or imposed upon its property), provided, however, that if at any time
after the date of this Lease the method of taxation of real estate prevailing at
the date of this lease is altered (other than a change from "in lieu" payment to
ad valorem assessment) and there is levied, assessed and imposed in addition
and/or in substitution, in whole or in part, for the present general real estate
taxes, a corporation franchise tax or any other tax, however denominated and by
whatever taxing authority (including, but not limited to, any municipal, county,
state or federal authority) which is measured by or based on whole or in part
upon the Demised Premises, or the value thereof, or the revenues or rents
derived therefrom, and which is imposed upon Landlord, then all such taxes, or
the part thereof so measured or based, will be deemed to be included within the
phrase "Real Estate Taxes" used herein but only to the extent to which such
taxes are substituted for the present general real estate taxes.

BILLING AND PAYMENT
- -------------------

     The amounts required to be paid By Tenant pursuant hereto will be paid by
Tenant in monthly installments in such amounts as are estimated by Landlord from
time to time (which may be revised from time to time as Landlord may deem
necessary). Within a reasonable time after the end of Landlord's fiscal year,
Landlord shall deliver to Tenant a statement of Operating Expenses and Real
Estate Taxes for such fiscal year and the monthly installments to be paid or
payable will be adjusted between Landlord and Tenant, Tenant agreeing to pay to
Landlord within thirty (30) days of receipt of such statement, and Landlord
agreeing to credit to Tenant (or to pay to Tenant if the Term of the Lease has
ended), within thirty (30) days of receipt of such statement, as applicable,
such amount as may be necessary to effect adjustment. Failure of Landlord to
provide the statement called for hereunder within the time prescribed will not
relieve Tenant from its obligations hereunder.

APPORTIONMENT; SURVIVAL
- -----------------------

          Any Operating Expenses and Real Estate Taxes, whether or not a lien
upon the Property, which accrue on an annual basis but relate in part to a
period subsequent to the Term, will be apportioned between Landlord and Tenant
as of the end of the Term based upon the final bill for the applicable year; it
being intended that Tenant will pay its pro rata share of only that portion of
the Operating Expenses and Real Estate Taxes as is allocable to the Term of this
Lease. Tenant's obligation to pay Operating Expenses and Real Estate Taxes, as
provided above, accruing during the Term, will survive the expiration or earlier
termination of this Lease.

connection with or attributable to the Building and Common Area (as described
hereinafter), including any parking facilities therein, for:

         (1) Electricity, water, gas, sewer, and all other utility services to
or for the Building or Common Area, including any utility taxes, fees, charges
or other similar impositions paid or incurred by Landlord in connection
therewith; and

         (2) Operation, maintenance (including reasonable reserves), security
services, replacement for normal wear and tear, repair, restripping or
resurfacing of paving, management (including costs of on-site offices and
personnel), insurance (including public liability and property damage, rent
continuation, boiler and machinery and extended coverage insurance), and
cleaning of the Building and Common Area and all furnishings, fixtures and
equipment therein, but excluding the costs of leasing and preparing space for
new tenants in the Building, or costs borne solely by Tenant under the Lease.
The term "Expenses" includes the annual amortization of costs (including
financing at the then prevailing rate, if any) of any equipment, device or
improvement required after completion of the Building by governmental authority
or incurred as a labor saving measure or to reduce operation or maintenance
expenses with respect to the Building and Common Area where such costs are
amortized over the useful life thereof and which do not inure primarily to the
benefit of any particular tenant; and

         (3) All real property taxes and personal property taxes, licenses,
charges and assessments which are levied, assessed, imposed or collected by
any governmental authority or improvement or assessment district during any
calendar year with respect to the Building or Common Area and the land on
which the same is located, and any improvements, fixtures, equipment and other
property of Landlord, real or personal, located in the Project and used in
connection with the operation or maintenance of the Building or Common Area
(computed on a cash basis or as if paid in permitted installments regardless
of whether actually so paid), as well as any tax which shall be levied or
assessed in addition to or in lieu of such taxes (it being acknowledged that
because of the passage of laws which limit increases in real property taxes,
government agencies may impose fees, charges, assessments or other levies in
connection with services previously furnished without charge or at a lesser
charge and which were previously paid for in whole or in part, directly or
indirectly by real property taxes), and gross excise tax or other similar tax,
and any costs or expenses of contesting any

  5
<PAGE>
 
such taxes, licenses, charges or assessments, but excluding any federal or state
income or gift tax or any franchise, capital stock, estate or inheritance taxes.

       (iii) The term "Common Area" means that portion of the Project other than
                      -------------                                             
the Building and other buildings for lease to tenants which is from time to time
designated and improved for nonexclusive, common use by more than one person.
The general location of the Common Area is shown on Exhibit A-1 attached hereto
                                                    -----------                
and incorporated by reference. The Common Area includes parking facilities in
the Project.

     Any cost or expense included in Expenses which is attributable to Common
Area shall be prorated by Landlord to the Building based on the proportion which
the total square footage of the Building bears to the total square footage of
all buildings in the Project from time to time or by such other fair and
reasonable method of allocation based on use or benefit as Landlord may
determine, except that, with regard to taxes, Landlord may use such allocation
of taxes among the various parcels in the Project as may have been used by the
taxing authority.

       (iv)  The term "Base Year" means the calendar year 1993.
                      -----------                              

       (v)   The term "Subsequent Year" means the first full calendar year
                      -----------------
following the Base Year and each calendar year, or part thereof, thereafter
occurring during the term of this Lease.

       (vi)  The term "Tenant's Share" means the proportion which the rentable
                      ----------------                                        
square footage of the Premises bears to the total rentable square footage of the
Building, which proportion is hereby agreed by Landlord and Tenant to be the
percentage set forth in Section 1 hereof.

     (b) Payment of Estimated Expenses. Tenant shall pay estimated Expenses to
Landlord as follows:

       (i)   Landlord shall submit to Tenant on or before March 31 of the first
Subsequent Year or as soon thereafter as Landlord has sufficient data, a
reasonably detailed statement showing the Expenses for the Base Year.

       (ii)  For each Subsequent Year, Landlord shall submit to Tenant, prior to
January 1 of such Subsequent Year or as soon thereafter as practicable, a
reasonably detailed statement showing the estimated Expenses for such Subsequent
Year. The determination of estimated Expenses hereunder shall be made by
Landlord based upon Landlord's experience with actual costs and projections.
Tenant shall pay monthly to Landlord an amount equal to the excess of (1) the
sum of the total annual estimated Expenses multiplied by Tenant's Share, minus
(2) Landlord's Base Year Costs over, (3) Twelve (12) months. If Landlord does
not submit said statement to Tenant prior to January 1 of any such Subsequent
Year, Tenant shall continue to pay its share of estimated Expenses

  6
<PAGE>
 
at the then existing rate until such statement is submitted, and, thereafter, at
the monthly Rent payment date next following the submittal of such statement,
shall pay its share of estimated Expenses based on the rate set forth in such
statement together with any amounts based on such rate which may have
theretofore accrued from January 1 of such Subsequent Year. Landlord may revise
such estimated Expenses at the end of the calendar quarter, and Tenant shall pay
Tenant's Share of such revised estimated Expenses after notice thereof as herein
provided.

     (c) Payment of Actual Expenses. Actual Expenses shall be reconciled against
payments of estimated Expenses as follows:

       (i)   On or before March 31 of each Subsequent Year or as soon as 
Landlord has sufficient data, Landlord shall submit to Tenant a reasonably
detailed statement showing the actual Expenses paid or incurred by Landlord
during the previous calendar year. If Tenant's Share of such actual Expenses
is less than the amount of estimated Expenses for such previous year
theretofore paid by Tenant, then Landlord shall credit the amount of such
difference against estimated and/or actual Expenses which may thereafter be
due from Tenant; provided, however, that in no event shall Tenant receive a
credit as provided herein for any amount calculated to be less than Landlord's
Expense Stop or Base Year amount. If Tenant's Share of such actual Expenses is
more than the amount of the estimated Expenses for such previous year
theretofore paid by Tenant, then Tenant shall, at the monthly Rent payment
date next following the submittal of such statement to Tenant, pay to Landlord
the full amount of such difference.

       (ii)  The reconciliation of the Expenses paid by Tenant for the calendar
year in which this Lease terminates shall be made upon Landlord's submittal to
Tenant of the statement of actual Expenses for such calendar year. The estimated
and actual Expenses for such calendar year shall be prorated based on the actual
number of days in such calendar year that this Lease was in effect, based on a
360 day year, and shall be compared. If pursuant to such comparison it is
determined that there has been an underpayment or an overpayment by Tenant for
such calendar year, Landlord shall refund the overpayment to Tenant, or Tenant
shall pay the amount calculated as owing to Landlord, as the case may be, within
thirty (30) days after the submittal of the statement by Landlord. This
provision shall survive the expiration or termination of the Lease. If
Landlord deems it advisable, Landlord may submit partial year statements
pursuant to this Section in order to cause an earlier reconciliation of
Expenses for the calendar year in which this Lease terminates.

     (d) Other Expense Provisions.

       (i)   Notwithstanding any provision of this Section to the contrary, if 
at any time during the term of this Lease any tenant, pursuant to an express
provision in its Lease and with Landlord's approval, contracts for certain
Building or Common Area services to be provided directly to it and at its
expense, which services would normally be furnished by Landlord (e.g.,
janitorial, maintenance,

  7
<PAGE>
 
utilities, etc.), then Landlord may make an appropriate adjustment in
calculating Tenant's Share of Expenses to the end that the cost of the remaining
services provided by Landlord are shared proportionately by all tenants
receiving such services.

       (ii)  Computation of Amount of Tenant's Proportionate Share on an Annual
Basis. In determining the amount of Expenses hereunder, if less than Ninety-Five
percent (95%) of the rentable area of the Building shall have been occupied by
tenants and fully used by them, at anytime during any year of the Lease term,
Expenses shall be adjusted by extrapolation to what the Expenses would have been
if the Building were Ninety-Five percent (95%) occupied during such year.

       (iii) The computation of Expenses pursuant to this Section is intended to
constitute a formula for an agreed sharing of costs by tenants, and may or may
not constitute an exact reimbursement to Landlord for costs paid by Landlord,
and for Landlord's administration.

       (iv)  Any delay or failure of Landlord in computing or billing for 
Expenses shall not constitute a waiver of, or in any way impair, the
obligation of Tenant to pay Expenses hereunder. However, Tenant shall not be
charged interest on unpaid Expenses which have accrued during such time that
Landlord has failed to submit a statement for such Expenses.

7. TAXES PAYABLE SOLELY BY TENANT

     In addition to the Rental and Expenses to be paid by Tenant, Tenant shall
pay before delinquency and without notice or demand by Landlord any and all
taxes levied or assessed on and which become payable by Tenant during the term
of this Lease (excluding, however, state and federal personal or corporate
income taxes measured by the income of Landlord from all sources, capital
stock taxes, and estate and inheritance taxes), whether or not now customary
or within the contemplation of the parties hereto, which are based upon,
measured by or otherwise calculated with respect to: (i) the gross or net Rent
payable under this Lease, including, without limitation, any gross receipts
tax or any other gross income tax or excise tax levied by any taxing authority
with respect to the receipt of the Rental hereunder; (ii) the value of
Tenant's equipment, furniture, fixtures or other personal property located in
the Premises; (iii) the possession, lease, operation, management, maintenance,
alteration, repair, use or occupancy by Tenant of the Premises or any portion
thereof; (iv) the value of any improvements, alterations or additions made in
or to the Premises by or on behalf of Tenant, except for those improvements
(if any) installed as part of Landlord's Work (as hereinafter defined) or (v)
this transaction or any document to which Tenant is a party creating or
transferring an interest or an estate in the Premises. Real property taxes on
improvements which are installed as part of Landlord's Work shall be deemed to
be included in the taxes described in Section 6(a)(ii)(3) above, as to which
Tenant shall pay Tenant's Share. If it is not lawful for Tenant to reimburse
Landlord for any such taxes paid or incurred by Landlord, the Rent shall be
revised so as to net Landlord the same Rental after imposition of such taxes
as would have been payable prior to the imposition of such taxes.

8. LATE PAYMENTS

     If Tenant fails to pay to Landlord when due any Rent, Expenses or other
sums owing to Landlord pursuant to the terms of this Lease, said late payment
shall bear interest at the Agreed Rate as herein provided and, in addition:

       (a) For each such late payment that is not paid within ten (10) days
after the date the same was due, Tenant shall pay to Landlord a service charge
equal to ten percent (10%) of the overdue amount. Tenant acknowledges and
agrees that such late payment by Tenant will cause Landlord to incur costs and
expenses not contemplated by this Lease, the exact amounts of which will be
extremely difficult to ascertain, and that such service charge represents a
fair estimate of the costs and expenses which Landlord would incur by reason
of Tenant's late payment. Tenant further agrees that such service charge shall
neither constitute a waiver of Tenant's default with respect to such overdue
amount nor prevent Landlord from exercising any other right or remedy
available to Landlord; and

       (b) Following any three consecutive late payments of Rent, Landlord
may, upon notice to Tenants,

         (i)  Require that, beginning with the first payment of Rent due
following the date the third late payment was due, Rent shall no longer be
paid in monthly installments but shall be payable three (3) months in advance;
and, in addition, or in the alternative at Landlord's election,

         (ii) Require that Tenant increase the amount of any Security Deposit
required herein by 100%, which additional security Deposit shall be retained by
Landlord, and which may be applied by Landlord, in the manner provided herein
with respect to any Security Deposit required herein.  If a Security Deposit is
not then held by Landlord, Tenant shall pay to Landlord a sum to be held as a
Security Deposit equal to 200% of the maximum amount of Rent reasonably
estimated by Landlord to be due from Tenant during the final full month of this
Lease.
<PAGE>
 
9.  SECURITY DEPOSIT

     Upon Tenant's execution of this Lease, Tenant shall deposit with Landlord a
"Security Deposit" in the amount set forth in Section 1 hereof, which shall be
held by Landlord as security for the faithful performance by Tenant of all of
the terms, covenants, and conditions of this Lease, it being expressly
understood and agreed that the deposit is neither an advance Rent deposit nor a
measure of Landlord's damages in case of Tenant's default.  If at any time
during the term of this Lease or any extended term thereof Tenant's Basic Rent
is increased, the Security Deposit shall be increased in the same proportion and
tenant shall deposit cash with Landlord in an amount sufficient to increase the
Security Deposit to the appropriate amount.  The Security Deposit may be
retained, used or applied by Landlord to remedy any default by Tenant, to repair
damage caused by Tenant to any part of the Project, and to clean the Premises
upon expiration or earlier termination of the Lease, as well as to reimburse
Landlord for any amount which Landlord may spend by reason of Tenant's default
or to compensate Landlord for any other loss or damage which Landlord may suffer
by reason of Tenant's default. If any portion of said deposit is so used or
applied, Tenant shall, within ten (10) days after written demand therefore,
deposit cash with Landlord in an amount sufficient to restore said deposit to
the full amount required hereunder, and Tenant's failure to do so shall be a
material breach of this Lease. Landlord shall not be required to keep the
Security Deposit separate from its general funds, and Tenant shall not be
entitled to interest on such deposit. Tenant may not elect to use any portion of
said Security Deposit as a Rental payment although Landlord may elect to do so
in the event Tenant is in default hereunder or is insolvent. If Tenant shall
fully and faithfully perform every provision of this Lease to be performed by
it, the Security Deposit or any balance thereof shall be returned to Tenant at
Tenant's last known address (or, at Landlord's option, to the last assignee of
Tenant's interest hereunder) within thirty (30) days after the Lease term has
ended and the Premises have been vacated by Tenant in the manner required by
this Lease.

10. TENANT IMPROVEMENTS

     (a) Applicability. If the Premises are being leased on an "As Is" basis
without any improvements, alterations or additions required to be made thereto
by Landlord or Tenant, the provisions of this Section shall not apply. However,
if any improvements, alterations or additions to the Premises are required to
be made by Landlord and/or Tenant, the provisions of the "Construction
Provisions" attached as Exhibit C hereto shall govern with regard to work to
                        ---------
be completed at Landlord's expense ("Landlord's Work"), if any, and work to be
                                   -------------------
completed at Tenant's expense ("Tenant's Work"), if any. Landlord has no
                              -----------------
obligation and has made no promise to alter, remodel, decorate, paint or
otherwise improve the Premises or any part thereof except as specifically set
forth in Section 2(e). To the extent Landlord is required to perform
Landlord's Work or Tenant's Work pursuant to the Construction Provisions,
Landlord shall use reasonable diligence to complete such work in a timely
manner.

11. USE

     The Premises shall be used and occupied by Tenant for general office
purposes and for no other purpose without the prior written consent of
Landlord, which Landlord may withhold in its sole discretion. Tenant
acknowledges that neither Landlord nor any agent of Landlord has made any
representation or warranty with respect to the Premises, the Building, or the
Project, with respect to the suitability thereof for the conduct of Tenant's
business. Tenant shall not do or permit anything to be done in or about the
Premises nor bring or keep anything therein which will in any way increase the
existing rate of or affect or cause a cancellation of any fire or other
insurance covering the Building, Common Area, or the Premises or any of its
contents, nor shall Tenant sell or permit to be kept, used or sold in or about
the Premises any article which may be prohibited by a standard form policy of

                                       10
<PAGE>
 
insurance. Tenant shall promptly upon demand reimburse Landlord for any
additional premium charges for any such insurance by reason of Tenant's
failure to comply with the provisions of this Section. Tenant agrees that it
will use the Premises in such manner as not to interfere with the rights of
other tenants of the Building or Common Area. Tenant shall neither use nor
allow the Premises, Building or Common Area to be used for any unlawful or
objectionable purpose, nor cause, maintain or permit any nuisance or waste in,
on or about any portion of the Project. Tenant will not place a load upon any
floor exceeding the floor load which such floor was designed to carry, and
Landlord reserves the right to prescribe the location of any safe or other
heavy equipment in the Premises. Tenant shall not use or allow anything to be
done in or about the Premises or the Project which will in any way conflict
with any law, ordinance or governmental regulation or requirement of any board
of fire underwriters or any duly constituted public authority now in force or
hereafter enacted or promulgated affecting the use or occupancy of the
Premises, and shall promptly comply with all such laws or requirements at its
sole cost and expense. The judgment of any court of competent jurisdiction or
any admission by Tenant that Tenant has violated any such law, statute,
ordinance, rule, regulation or requirement shall be conclusive of such fact
between Landlord and Tenant.

12. SERVICE AND UTILITIES

     (a) Landlord's Obligations. Provided Tenant is not in default hereunder,
Landlord shall as a part of Expenses make available to the Premises during the
Building's normal business hours as set forth in Rule 17 of the Rules and
Regulations described in Section 36 hereof, such amounts of air conditioning,
heating and ventilation as may be required in Landlord's reasonable judgment for
the comfortable use of the Premises, as well as elevator service, reasonable
amounts of electric current for normal lighting by Building Standard overhead
fixtures and for fractional horsepower office machines, and water for lavatory
and drinking purposes. "Building Standard" fixtures and equipment are as
described in Schedule A to Exhibit C attached hereto or, in absence thereof, as
             ----------    ---------                                           
installed in the typical common corridor. Landlord shall as a part of Expenses
replace Building Standard light bulbs, tubes and ballasts which need replacing
due to normal use. Landlord shall also as a part of Expenses maintain and keep
lighted the common stairs, entries and toilet rooms in the Building and shall
provide trash removal, janitorial service and window washing customary for
similar buildings in the same geographical area. Except to the extent caused
by Landlord's negligence, Landlord shall not be in default hereunder or liable
for any damages directly or indirectly resulting from, nor shall the Rent be
abated or shall there be deemed a constructive or other eviction of Tenant by
reason of (i) the installation, use or interruption of use of any equipment in
connection with the furnishing of any of the foregoing utilities and services,
(ii) failure to furnish, or delay in furnishing, any such utilities or
services when such failure or delay is caused by acts of God, acts of
government, labor disturbances of any kind, or other conditions beyond the
reasonable control of Landlord, or by the making of repairs or improvements to
the Premises or any part of the Project, or (iii) governmental limitation,
curtailment, rationing or restriction on use of water, electricity or any
other service or utility whatsoever serving the Premises, Building or Common
Area. Landlord shall be entitled to cooperate with the energy

                                       11
<PAGE>
 
conservation efforts of governmental agencies or utility suppliers. The failure
of Landlord to provide such services if consistent with the foregoing shall not
constitute a constructive or other eviction of Tenant.

     (b) After-Hours Charges. During non-business hours Landlord shall as a
part of Expenses keep the public areas of the Building lighted, shall provide
electricity to the Premises and shall provide elevator service with at least
one elevator, but shall not be obligated to furnish air conditioning to the
Premises. If Tenant requires air conditioning during non-business hours Tenant
shall give Landlord at least twenty-four (24) hours prior notice of such
requirement or shall follow such other procedure for activating the building
energy management system as Landlord may advise Tenant, and Tenant shall pay
Landlord the "After-Hours Charges" for such extra service at the rate set
forth in Section 1 hereof. Such rates are subject to increase from time to
time based on increases in Landlord's costs associated with providing such
extra services. All payment required for After-Hours Charges shall be deemed
to be additional Rent and Landlord shall have the same remedies for a default
in payment thereof as for a default in payment of Rent.

     (c) Tenant's Obligations. Tenant-shall pay, prior to delinquency, for all
telephone charges and all other materials and services not expressly required to
be paid by Landlord, which may be furnished to or used in, on or about the
Premises during the term of this Lease. Tenant shall also pay, as additional
Rent, all charges and fees required to be paid by Tenant by the Rules and
Regulations described in Section 36 of this Lease.

     (d) Excess Utility Usage. Tenant will not without prior written consent of
Landlord use any apparatus or device in the Premises, including (without
limitation) electronic data processing machines and telephone switchgear, which
will materially increase the amount of cooling or ventilation or electricity or
water usually furnished or supplied for use of the Premises as general office
space; nor shall Tenant connect with electric current (except through existing
electrical outlets in the Premises) or water pipes, any apparatus or device for
the purpose of using electrical current or water, except as may be provided in
the Construction Provisions. If Tenant uses electricity at a rate in excess of
4 kilowatt/hours per usable square foot of the Premises per year, the cost to
Landlord of any such excess use of utility service by Tenant shall be paid by
Tenant based on Landlord's reasonable estimates and costs. If Tenant requires
or uses ventilation, cooling, water or electric current or any other resource
in excess of that usually furnished or supplied for use of the Premises as
general office space, Landlord may cause a special meter or other measuring
device to be installed in or about the Premises to measure the amount of
water, electric current or other resource consumed by Tenant. The cost of any
such meter, and of the installation, maintenance and repair thereof, shall be
paid for by Tenant, and Tenant agrees to pay Landlord promptly upon demand for
all such water, electric current or other resource consumed, as shown by said
meter, at the rates charged by the local public utility or other supplier
furnishing the same, plus any additional expense incurred by Landlord in
keeping account of the foregoing and administering same. If any lights,
machines or equipment (including but not limited

                                       12
<PAGE>
 
to computers) are used by Tenant in the Premises which materially affect the
temperature otherwise maintained by the heating, ventilation or air
conditioning system, or generate substantially more heat in the Premises than
would be generated by Building Standard lights or usual fractional horsepower
office equipment, Landlord shall have the right to install any machinery and
equipment which Landlord deems necessary to restore the temperature balance in
any affected part of the Building, including but not limited to modifications
to the Building Standard air conditioning equipment, and the cost thereof
including the cost of installation and any additional cost of operation and
maintenance occasioned thereby shall be paid by Tenant to Landlord upon
demand. Any sums payable under this Section 12(d) shall be considered
additional Rent, and Landlord shall have the same remedies for a default in
payment of such sum as for a default in the payment of Rent.

13. ENTRY BY LANDLORD

     Landlord and its authorized representatives shall have the right to enter
the premises at all reasonable times during normal business hours and at any
time in case of an emergency (i) to determine whether the Premises are in good
condition and whether Tenant is complying with its obligations under this
Lease, (ii) to maintain or to make any repair or restoration to the Building
that Landlord has the right or obligation to perform, (iii) to install any
meters or other equipment which Landlord may have the right to install, (iv)
to serve, post, or keep posted any notices required or allowed under the
provisions of this Lease, (v) to post "for sale" signs at any time during the
term, and to post "for rent" or "for lease" signs during the last three (3)
months of the term or during any period which Tenant is in default, (vi) to
show the Premises to prospective brokers, agents, buyers, tenants, or persons
interested in an exchange, (vii) to shore the foundations, footings, and walls
of the Building and to erect scaffolding and protective barricades around and
about the Building or the Premises, but not so as to prevent entry into the
Premises, and (viii) to do any other act or thing necessary for the safety or
preservation of the Premises or the Building. Landlord shall have the right at
all times to have and retain a key with which to unlock all doors in, upon and
about the Premises excluding Tenant's vaults and safes, and Landlord shall
have the right to use any and all means which Landlord may deem proper to gain
entry in an emergency, and any entry to the Premises obtained by Landlord in
accordance with the foregoing shall not be construed or deemed to be a
forcible or unlawful entry into, or a detainer of, the Premises, or an
eviction of Tenant from the Premises or any portion thereof. Tenant hereby
waives any claim for damages for any injury or inconvenience to or
interference with Tenant's business and any loss of occupancy or quiet
enjoyment of the Premises by reason of Landlord's exercise of its right of
entry in accordance with this Section, and Tenant shall not be entitled to an
abatement or reduction of Rent or Expenses in connection therewith.

14. MAINTENANCE AND REPAIR

     (a) Landlord's Obligations. Landlord shall as part of Expenses maintain or
cause to be maintained in good order, condition and repair the structural and
common portions of the Building and

                                       13
<PAGE>
 
all Common Areas in the Project (except to the extent of damage caused by
Tenant which shall be repaired by Landlord at Tenant's expense). Landlord
shall not be liable, and neither Rent nor Expenses shall be abated, for any
failure by Landlord to maintain and repair areas which are being used in
connection with construction or reconstruction of improvements, or for any
failure to make any repairs or perform any maintenance, unless such failure
shall persist for an unreasonable time after written notice of the need
thereof is given to Landlord by Tenant. To the extent the provisions of this
Section are in conflict with any statute now or hereafter in effect which
would afford Tenant the right to make repairs at Landlord's expense or to
terminate this Lease, the provisions of this Section shall govern.

     (b) Tenant's Obligations.

         (i)   Tenant shall, at its sole cost and expense, except for janitorial
services furnished by Landlord pursuant to Section 12 hereof, maintain the
Premises including all improvements therein in good order, condition and repair.

         (ii)  In connection with Tenant surrendering possession of the 
Premises at the end of the Lease term, Tenant agrees to repair any damage
caused by or in connection with the removal of any article of personal
property, business or trade fixtures, machinery, equipment, cabinetwork,
furniture, movable partitions or permanent improvements or additions,
including without limitation thereto, repairing the floor and patching and
painting the walls where required by Landlord to Landlord's reasonable
satisfaction, all at Tenant's sole cost and expense. Tenant shall indemnify,
defend and hold Landlord harmless against any loss, liability, cost or expense
(including reasonable attorney's fees) resulting from delay by Tenant in so
surrendering the Premises. Tenant's obligation hereunder shall survive the
expiration or termination of this Lease,

         (iii) If Tenant fails to maintain the Premises in good order, 
condition and repair, Landlord may give Tenant notice to do such acts as are
reasonably required to so maintain the Premises. If Tenant thereafter fails to
promptly commence such work and diligently prosecute it to completion, then
Landlord shall have the right to do such acts and expend such funds at the
expense of Tenant as are reasonably required to perform such work. Any amount
so expended by Landlord [together with a charge for Landlord's administration
and overhead equal to five percent (5%) thereof] shall be paid by Tenant
promptly after demand, with interest at the Agreed Rate from the date of such
work. Landlord shall have no liability to Tenant for any inconvenience or
interference with the use of the Premises by Tenant as a result of performing
any such work.

     (c) Compliance with Law. Landlord and Tenant shall each do all acts
required to comply with all applicable laws, ordinances, and rules of any
public authority relating to their respective maintenance obligations as set
forth herein.

                                      14
<PAGE>
 
15. ALTERATIONS AND ADDITIONS

     Tenant shall make no alterations, additions or improvements to the
Premises or any part thereof having a cost in excess of $5,000 or which
affects the exterior appearance of the Premises or the Building or any common
portion of the Building or any portion of the Common Area or the electrical,
mechanical, plumbing or other systems in the Building, without obtaining the
prior written consent of Landlord in each instance. Such consent may be
granted or withheld at Landlord's sole discretion. Any such alterations,
additions or improvements consented to by Landlord may, at Landlord's option,
be made by Landlord for Tenant's account and Tenant shall reimburse Landlord
for the cost thereof [together with a charge for Landlord's administration and
management thereof equal to five percent (5%) of the cost incurred] within
thirty (30) days after an invoice therefor is submitted to Tenant. Landlord
may impose as a condition to such consent such requirements as Landlord may
deem necessary in its sole discretion, including (without limitation) the
requirement that Landlord be furnished with working drawings before work
commences and that a bond be furnished, and requirements relating to the
manner in which the work is done, the contractor by whom it is performed, and
the times during which it is accomplished, as well as the requirement that
upon written request of Landlord prior to the expiration or earlier
termination of the Lease, Tenant will remove at its expense any such
alterations, improvements or additions to the Premises. Any damage done to the
Premises in connection with any such removal shall be repaired at Tenant's
sole cost and expense. Landlord may, in connection with any such removal which
reasonably might involve damaging the Premises, require that such removal be
performed by a bonded contractor or other person for which a bond satisfactory
to Landlord has been furnished covering the cost of repairing the anticipated
damage. Unless so removed, all such alterations, additions or improvements
shall at the expiration or earlier termination of the Lease become the
property of Landlord and remain upon the Premises. All such improvements,
alterations or additions must be done in a good and workmanlike manner and
diligently prosecuted to completion so that the Premises shall at all times be
a complete unit except during the period of work. Such improvements,
alterations or additions shall only be constructed by a contractor which is
bondable and which shall use union employees only, except that such contractor
may use non-union employees only if prior to the commencement of any work
Tenant obtains Landlord's written consent which Landlord may withhold unless
it is adequately protected against any and all loss or damage that may result
from labor problems or any work stoppage or interruption arising from the use
of such non-union employees. Tenant shall deliver to Landlord upon
commencement of such work, a copy of the building permit with respect thereto.
Upon completion of such work Tenant shall file for record in the office of the
County Recorder where the Project is located a Notice of Completion, as
required or permitted by law. All such work shall be performed so as to not
obstruct the access to the premises of any tenant in the Building or Project.
Tenant agrees to carry insurance as required by Section 17 covering any
improvements, alterations or additions to the Premises made by Tenant under
the provisions of this Section, it being expressly agreed that none of such
improvements, additions or alterations shall be insured by Landlord under the
insurance Landlord may carry upon the Building, nor shall Landlord be required
under any provision for reconstruction to reinstall any such improvements,

                                       15
<PAGE>
 
additions or alterations. In addition, it is expressly agreed that if any tax is
imposed, or the amount of taxes on the Building or the Project is increased, by
reason of any such improvements, alterations or additions, Tenant shall be
solely responsible therefor under Section 7.

16. INDEMNITY

     (a) Indemnification by Tenant. Tenant shall indemnify, defend and hold
Landlord, its agents and employees, harmless from and against any and all
claims, liability, loss, cost or expense (including reasonable attorneys' fees)
arising out of or in connection with (i) any injury or damage to any person or
property occurring in, on or about the Premises or any part thereof or the
Building or Common Area, if such injury or damage is caused in part or in whole
by any act or omission by Tenant, its agents, contractors, employees, or
invitees or (ii) any breach or default in the performance of any obligation on
Tenant's part to be performed under this Lease. If any action or proceeding is
brought against Landlord by reason of any such claim, upon notice from Landlord,
Tenant shall defend the same at Tenant's expense by counsel reasonably
satisfactory to Landlord. Tenant, as a material part of the consideration to
Landlord, hereby assumes all risk of damage to property or injury to persons in,
upon or about the Premises from any cause except Landlord's negligence or
wrongful acts, and Tenant hereby waives all claims with respect thereto against
Landlord. The foregoing provisions shall survive the termination of this Lease.

     (b) Exemption of Landlord from Liability. If the Premises, the Building, or
the Common Area, or any part thereof, is damaged by fire or other cause against
which Tenant is required to carry insurance pursuant to this Lease, Landlord
shall not be liable to Tenant for any loss, cost or expense arising out of or in
connection with such damage. Tenant hereby releases Landlord, its directors,
officers, shareholders, partners, employees, agents and representatives, from
any liability, claim or action arising out of or in connection with such damage,
Furthermore, Tenant shall pursuant to Section 17 maintain insurance against
loss, injury, or damage which may be sustained by the person, goods, wares,
merchandise or property of Tenant, its agents, contractors, employees, invitees
or customers, or any other person in or about the Premises, caused by or
resulting from fire, steam, electricity, gas, water, or rain, which may leak
or flow from or into any part of the Premises or the Building, or from the
breakage, leakage, obstruction or other defects of the pipes, sprinklers,
wires, appliances, plumbing, air conditioning or lighting fixtures of the
same, whether such damage or injury results from conditions arising within the
Premises or other portions of the Building, or from other sources, and
Landlord shall not be liable therefor, unless caused by Landlord's negligence
or wrongful act, and in that event only to the extent not covered by the
insurance which Tenant is required to carry pursuant to this Lease. Landlord
shall not be liable to Tenant for any damages arising out of or in connection
with any act or omission of any other tenant of the Project or for losses due
to theft or burglary or other wrongful acts of third parties.

                                       16

17. INSURANCE

     (a) General. All insurance required to be carried by Tenant hereunder shall
be issued by responsible insurance companies acceptable to Landlord and the
holder of any deed of trust or mortgage secured by any portion of the Premises
(hereinafter referred to as a "Mortgagee"). All policies of insurance provided
                              ------------
for herein shall be issued by insurance companies with a general
policyholder's rating of not less than A and a financial rating not less than
Class X as rated in the most current available "Best Insurance Reports." Each
policy shall name Landlord and at Landlord's request any Mortgagee as an
additional insured, as their respective interests may appear. Tenant shall
deliver certificates of such insurance to Landlord, evidencing the existence
and amounts of such insurance, at least ten (10) days prior to Tenant's
occupancy in the Premises. Failure to make such delivery shall constitute a
material default by Tenant under this Lease. All policies of insurance
delivered to Landlord must contain a provision that the company writing said
policy will give Landlord thirty (30) days prior written notice of any
modification, cancellation or lapse or reduction in the amounts of insurance.
All public liability, property damage and other casualty insurance policies
shall be written as primary policies, not contributing with, and not in excess
of coverage which Landlord may carry. Tenant shall furnish Landlord with
renewals or "binders" of any such policy at least thirty (30) days prior to
the expiration thereof. Tenant agrees that if Tenant does not procure and
maintain such insurance, Landlord may (but shall not be required to) obtain
such insurance on Tenant's behalf and charge Tenant the premiums therefor
together with a twenty-five percent (25%) handling charge, payable upon
demand. Tenant may carry such insurance under a blanket policy provided such
blanket policy expressly affords the coverage required by this Lease by a
Landlord's protective liability endorsement or otherwise and evidence thereof
is furnished to Landlord as required above.

     (b) Casualty Insurance. At all time during the term hereof, Tenant shall
maintain in effect policies of casualty insurance covering (i) all improvements
in, on or to the Premises (including any Building Standard furnishings, and any
alterations, additions or improvements as may be made by Tenant), and (ii) trade
fixtures, merchandise and other personal property from time to time in, on or
upon the Premises. Such policies shall include coverage in an amount not less
than one hundred percent (100%) of the actual replacement cost thereof from time
to time during the term of this Lease. Such policies shall provide protection
against any peril included within the classification "Fire and Extended
Coverage," against vandalism and malicious mischief, theft, sprinkler leakage
and against flood damage (and including cost of demolition and debris
removal). Replacement cost for purposes hereof shall be determined by an
accredited appraiser selected by Landlord or otherwise by mutual agreement.
The proceeds of such insurance shall be used for the repair or replacement of
the property so insured. Upon termination of this Lease following a casualty
as set forth in Section 18, the proceeds under (i) above shall be paid to
Landlord, and the proceeds under (ii) above shall be paid to Tenant.

                                       17
<PAGE>
 
     (c) Liability Insurance. Tenant shall at all times during the term hereof
obtain and continue in force bodily injury liability and property damage
liability insurance adequate to protect Landlord against liability for injury
to or death of any person in connection with the activities of Tenant in, on
or about the Premises or with the use, operation or condition of the Premises.
Such insurance at all times shall be in an amount of not less than Two Million
Dollars ($2,000,000) for injuries to persons in one accident, not less than
One Million Dollars ($1,000,000) for injury to any one person and not less
than Five Hundred Thousand Dollars ($500,000) with respect to damage to
property. The limits of such insurance do not necessarily limit the liability
of Tenant hereunder. All public liability and property damage policies shall
contain a provision that Landlord, although named as an insured, shall
nevertheless be entitled to recovery under said policies for any loss
occasioned to it, its partners, agents and employees by reason of the
negligence of Tenant.

     (d) Workers' Compensation Insurance. Tenant shall, at all times during the
term hereof, maintain in effect workers' compensation insurance as required by
applicable statutes.

     (e) Adjustment. Every three (3) years during the term of this Lease, or
whenever Tenant materially improves or alters the Premises, whichever is
earlier, Landlord and Tenant shall mutually agree to increases in Tenant's
insurance policy limits for the insurance to be carried by Tenant as set forth
in this Section. If Landlord and Tenant cannot mutually agree upon the amounts
of said increases within thirty (30) days after notice from Landlord, then the
insurance policy limits set forth in this Section shall be adjusted upward by an
accredited insurance appraiser approved by Landlord to reflect increased
replacement costs and increased limits of liability then prevailing generally in
the local real estate industry for comparable property.

     (f) Landlord's Insurance. Landlord shall at all times from and after
substantial completion of the Premises maintain in effect as an item of Expense
a policy or policies of insurance covering the Common Area and the buildings in
the Project in an amount up to one hundred percent (100%) of the actual
replacement cost thereof (exclusive of the cost of excavations, foundations and
footings) from time to time during the term of this Lease, providing protection
against rental loss and any peril generally included in the classification "Fire
and Extended Coverage" which may include insurance against sprinkler damage,
vandalism, malicious mischief, earthquake and third party liability, and
including such coverages in such amounts as Landlord may designate. Landlord's
obligation to carry the insurance provided for herein may be brought within
the coverage of any so-called blanket policy or policies of insurance carried
and maintained by Landlord, provided that the coverage afforded will not be
reduced or diminished by reason of the use of such blanket policy of
insurance.

     (g) Waiver of Subrogation. Landlord and Tenant each hereby waives any and
all rights of recovery against the other or against the directors, officers,
shareholders, partners, employees, agents and representatives of the other, on
account of loss or damage of such waiving party or its property, or the property
of others under its control, to the extent that such loss or damage is insured
against

                                       18
<PAGE>
 
under any fire and extended coverage insurance policy which either may have in
force at the time of such loss or damage. Tenant shall, upon obtaining the
policies of insurance required under this Lease, give notice to its insurance
carrier(s) that the foregoing mutual waiver of subrogation is contained in
this Lease. The waivers set forth herein shall be required to the extent that
same are available from each party's insurer without additional premium; if an
extra charge is incurred to obtain such waiver, it shall be paid by the party
in whose favor the waiver runs within fifteen (15) days after written notice
from the other party.

18. DAMAGE AND DESTRUCTION

     (a) Partial Damage - Insured. If the Premises, Building or Common Area are
damaged by a risk covered under fire and extended coverage insurance protecting
Landlord, then Landlord shall restore such damage provided insurance proceeds
are available to Landlord to pay eighty percent (80%) or more of the cost of
restoration, and provided such restoration by Landlord can be completed within
six (6) months after the commencement of work, in the opinion of a registered
architect or engineer appointed by Landlord. In such event this Lease shall
continue in full force and effect so long as the Premises can be used by Tenant,
except that Tenant shall, so long as the damage is not due to the act or
omission of Tenant, be entitled to an equitable reduction of Rent and Expenses
while such restoration takes place, such reduction to be based upon the extent
to which the damage and the restoration efforts directly and materially
interfere with Tenant's use of the Premises.

     (b) Partial Damage - Uninsured. If the Premises, Building or Common Area
are damaged by a risk not covered by such insurance or the insurance proceeds
available to Landlord are less than eighty percent (80%) of the cost of
restoration, or if the restoration cannot be completed within six (6) months
after the commencement of work in the opinion of the registered architect or
engineer appointed by Landlord, then Landlord shall have the option either to
(i) repair or restore such damage, this Lease continuing in full force and
effect so long as the Premises can be used by Tenant, but the Rent and Expenses
to be equitably reduced as hereinabove provided, or (ii) give notice to Tenant
at any time within ninety (90) days after such damage terminating this Lease as
of a date to be specified in such notice, which date shall be not less than
thirty (30) nor more than sixty (60) days after giving such notice. If such
notice is given, this Lease shall expire and any interest of Tenant in the
Premises shall terminate on the date specified in such notice and the Rent and
Expenses, reduced by an equitable reduction (except as hereinabove provided)
based upon the extent, if any, to which such damage directly and materially
interfered with Tenant's use of the Premises, shall be paid to the date of
such termination, and Landlord agrees to refund to Tenant any Rent or Expenses
theretofore paid in advance for any period of time subsequent to such
termination date.

     (c) Total Destruction. If the Premises are totally destroyed (i.e., over
eighty percent (80%) of the Premises is destroyed or if Tenant cannot use the
Premises without major restoration) or if in Landlord's judgment the Premises
cannot be restored as set forth above, then, notwithstanding the

                                       19
<PAGE>
 
availability of insurance proceeds, this Lease shall be terminated effective as
of the date of the damage,

     (d) Landlord's Obligations. Landlord shall not be required to carry
insurance of any kind on Tenant's property and shall not in the absence of
Landlord's negligence or wrongful acts be required to repair any injury or
damage thereto by fire or other cause, or to make any restoration or replacement
of any paneling, decorations, partitions, ceilings, floor covering, office
fixtures or any other improvements or property installed in the Premises by or
at the direct or indirect expense of Tenant, and Tenant shall be required to
restore or replace same in the event of damage and shall have no claim against
Landlord for any loss suffered by reason of any such damage, destruction, repair
or restoration. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this
Section, Landlord shall have the option not to repair, reconstruct or restore
the Premises with respect to damage or destruction as described in this Section
occurring during the last twelve (12) months of the term of this Lease or any
extension thereof, provided, however, that if Landlord exercises such option
this Lease shall be terminated upon such exercise.

     (e) Waiver by Tenant. It is expressly agreed that this Section shall govern
the rights of Landlord and Tenant in the event of damage and destruction and
supersedes the provisions of any statutes with respect to any damage or
destruction of the Premises.

19. CONDEMNATION

     If all or a substantial part of the Premises, Building or Common Area is
taken or appropriated for public or quasi-public use by the right of eminent
domain or otherwise by taking in the nature of inverse condemnation, with or
without litigation, or is transferred by agreement in lieu thereof (any of the
foregoing being referred to herein as a "taking"), either party hereto may, by
                                        ---------                             
written notice given to the other within thirty (30) days of receipt of notice
of such taking, elect to terminate this Lease as of the date possession is
transferred pursuant to the taking; provided, however, that before such party
may terminate this Lease for a taking, such taking shall be of such an extent
and nature as to economically frustrate its business therein, or to
substantially handicap, impede or impair its use thereof. No award for any
partial or entire taking shall be apportioned, and Tenant hereby assigns to
Landlord any and all rights of Tenant now or hereafter arising in or to the
same or any part thereof; provided, however, that Tenant may file a separate
claim for an award and nothing contained herein shall be deemed to give
Landlord any interest in, or to require Tenant to assign to Landlord, any
award made to Tenant for the taking of personal property belonging to Tenant.
In the event of a taking which does not result in a termination of this Lease,
Rent and Expenses shall be equitably reduced to the extent Tenant's business
in or use of the Premises is economically impaired as described above. No
temporary taking of the Premises or any part of the Project shall terminate
this Lease, or give Tenant any right to any abatement of Rent and Expenses
hereunder, except that Rent and Expenses shall be equitably reduced as
described above during that portion of any temporary taking lasting more than

                                       20
<PAGE>
 
thirty (30) days. To the extent the provisions of this Section conflict with
California Code of Civil Procedure Section 1265.130 allowing either party to
petition the court to terminate this Lease for a partial taking, the
provisions of this Section shall govern.

20. LIENS

     Tenant shall keep the Premises, the Building and the Project free from any
liens arising out of work performed, materials furnished, or obligations
incurred by Tenant, and shall indemnify, hold harmless and defend Landlord from
any liens and encumbrances arising out of any work performed or materials
furnished by or at the direction of Tenant. Tenant shall give Landlord at least
ten (10) business days prior written notice of the expected date of commencement
of work relating to alteration, improvements, or additions to the Premises and
if requested by Landlord shall secure a completion and indemnity bond for said
work, satisfactory to Landlord, in an amount equal to one and one-half (1 1/2)
times the estimated cost of such work. Landlord shall have the right at all
times to keep posted on the Premises any notices permitted or required by law,
or which Landlord shall deem proper, for the protection of Landlord and the
Premises, and any other party having any interest therein, against mechanics'
and materialmens liens. If any claim of lien is filed against the Premises or
any part of the Project or any similar action affecting title to such property
is commenced, the party receiving notice of such lien or action shall
immediately give the other party written notice thereof. If Tenant fails, within
twenty (20) days following the imposition of any lien, to cause such lien to be
released of record by payment or posting of a proper bond, Landlord shall have,
in addition to all other remedies provided herein and by law, the right (but no
obligation) to cause the same to be released by such means as it shall deem
proper, including payment of the claim giving rise to such lien. All such sums
paid by Landlord and all costs and expenses incurred by it in connection
therewith (including reasonable attorneys' fees) shall be payable to Landlord by
Tenant on demand, with interest at the Agreed Rate from the date of expenditure.

21. DEFAULTS BY TENANT

     The occurrence of any one or more of the following events shall constitute
a material default and breach of this Lease by Tenant:

     (a) The abandonment of the Premises by Tenant.

     (b) The failure by Tenant to make any payment of Rent or Expenses or of any
other sum required to be made by Tenant hereunder, as and when due.

     (c) The failure by Tenant to observe or perform any of the covenants,
conditions or provisions of this Lease to be observed or performed by Tenant, if
such failure is not cured within thirty (30) days after written notice thereof
from Landlord to Tenant; provided, however, that if the nature of Tenant's

                                       21
<PAGE>
 
default is such that it cannot be cured solely by payment of money and more
than thirty (30) days are reasonably required for its cure, then Tenant shall
not be deemed to be in default if Tenant commences such cure within the thirty
(30) day period and thereafter diligently prosecutes such cure to completion;
provided, further, that repeated breaches or defaults by Tenant [more than
three (3) in any twelve (12) month period] shall entitle Landlord at its
option, to terminate this Lease unless Tenant furnished Landlord with adequate
assurances, in Landlord's sole judgment, against further defaults; and
provided, further, that violations by Tenant of the Rules and Regulations
described in Section 36 which interfere with the rights of other tenants or
which constitute a nuisance or hazard shall be cured by Tenant within forty-
eight (48) hours after written notice thereof from Landlord, failing which
Landlord may (but need not) cure same, in which event Tenant shall pay
Landlord, within ten (10) days after written notice thereof by Landlord, the
amount expended by Landlord to effect such cure together with an
administrative charge of fifteen percent (15%) of the amount thereof.

     (d) The making by Tenant of any general assignment for the benefit of
creditors, the filing by or against Tenant of a petition to have Tenant adjudged
a bankrupt or of a petition for reorganization or arrangement under any law
relating to bankruptcy [unless, in the case of a petition filed against Tenant,
the same is dismissed within sixty (60) days] or the appointment of a trustee or
receiver to take possession of, or the attachment, execution or other judicial
seizure of, substantially all of Tenant's assets located at the Premises or of
Tenant's interest in this Lease, where such seizure is not discharged within
thirty (30) days.

     Any notice required or permitted by this Section is intended to satisfy to
the maximum extent possible any and all notice requirements imposed by law on
Landlord. Landlord may serve a statutory notice to quit, a statutory notice to
pay rent or quit, or a statutory notice of default, as the case may be, to
effect the giving of any notice required by this Section.

22. LANDLORD'S REMEDIES

     In the event of any material default or breach of this Lease by Tenant,
Landlord's obligations under this Lease shall be suspended and Landlord may at
any time thereafter, without limiting Landlord in the exercise of any other
right or remedy at law or in equity which Landlord may have (all remedies
provided herein being non-exclusive and cumulative), do any one or more of the
following:

     (a) Maintain this Lease in full force and effect and recover the Rent,
Expenses and other monetary charges as they become due, without terminating
Tenant's right to possession irrespective of whether Tenant shall have abandoned
the Premises. If Landlord does not elect to terminate the Lease, Landlord shall
have the right to attempt to relet the Premises at such rent and upon such
conditions, and for such a term, as Landlord deems appropriate in its sole
discretion and to do all acts necessary with regard thereto, without being
deemed to have elected to terminate the Lease, including re-entering the
Premises to make repairs or to maintain or modify the Premises, and removing all

                                       22
<PAGE>
 
persons and property from the Premises; which property if removed may at
Landlord's election be abandoned or stored in a public warehouse or elsewhere
at the cost of and for the account of Tenant. Reletting may be for a period
shorter or longer than the remaining term of this Lease, and for more or less
rent, but Landlord shall have no obligation to relet at less than prevailing
market rental rates. If reletting occurs, this Lease shall terminate
automatically when the new tenant takes possession of the Premises and
commences rent payment. Notwithstanding that Landlord does not elect to
terminate the Lease initially, Landlord at any time thereafter may elect to
terminate the Lease by virtue of any uncured default by Tenant. In the event
of any such termination, Landlord shall be entitled to recover from Tenant any
and all damages incurred by Landlord by reason of Tenant's default [including,
without limitation, the damages described in Section 22(b) below], as well as
all costs of reletting, including commissions, reasonable attorneys' fees,
restoration or remodeling costs, and costs of advertising.

     (b) Terminate Tenant's right to possession by any lawful means, in which
case this Lease shall terminate and Tenant shall immediately surrender
possession of the Premises to Landlord. In such event Landlord shall be entitled
to recover from Tenant all damages incurred by Landlord by reason of Tenant's
default including (without limitation) the following: (1) the worth, at the time
of award, of any unpaid Rent which had been earned at the time of such
termination; plus (2) the worth, at the time of award, of the amount by which
the unpaid Rent which would have been earned after termination until the time of
award exceeds the amount of such Rental loss that Tenant proves could have been
reasonably avoided; plus (3) the worth, at the time of award, of the amount by
which the unpaid Rent for the balance of the term after the time of award
exceeds the amount of such Rental loss that Tenant proves could have been
reasonably avoided; plus (4) any other amount, and court costs, necessary to
compensate Landlord for all the detriment proximately caused by Tenant's default
or which in the ordinary course of things would be likely to result therefrom
(including, without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the amount of any
commissions and/or finder's fee for a replacement tenant); plus (5) at
Landlord's election, such other amounts in addition to or in lieu of the
foregoing as may be permitted from time to time by applicable law. As used in
subsections (1) and (2) of this Section 22(b), the "worth, at the time of award"
                                                   -----------------------------
is to be computed by allowing interest at the then maximum rate of interest
allowable under law which could be charged Tenant by Landlord, and, as used in
subsection (3) of this Section 22(b), the "worth, at the time of award" is to
                                          -----------------------------
be computed by discounting such amount at the discount rate of the U.S.
Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco at the time of award, plus one percent
(1%). The term "Rent," as used in the Section, shall be deemed to be and to
               -------                                                  
mean all Rent, Expenses, parking fees and other monetary sums required to be
paid by Tenant pursuant to this Lease or as defined in Section 4(a) hereof.
For the purpose of determining the amount of "unpaid Rent which would have
been earned after termination" or the "unpaid Rent for the balance of the
term" (as referenced in subsections (2) and (3) hereof), the amount of parking
fees and Expenses shall be deemed to increase annually for the balance of the
term by an amount equal to the average annual percentage increase in parking
fees and Expenses during the three (3) calendar years preceding the year in
which the Lease was terminated, or, if such termination shall occur prior to
the

                                       23
<PAGE>
 
expiration of the third calendar year occurring during the term of this Lease,
then the amount of parking fees and Expenses shall be deemed to increase
monthly for the balance of the term by an amount equal to the average monthly
percentage increase in parking fees and Expenses during all of the calendar
months preceding the month in which the Lease was terminated.

     (c) Collect sublease rents (or appoint a receiver to collect such rent) and
otherwise perform Tenant's obligations at the Premises, it being agreed,
however, that neither the filing of a petition for the appointment of a receiver
for Tenant nor the appointment itself shall constitute an election by Landlord
to terminate this Lease.

     (d) Proceed to cure the default at Tenant's sole cost and expense, without
waiving or releasing Tenant from any obligation hereunder. If at any time
Landlord pays any sum or incurs any expense as a result of or in connection with
curing any default of Tenant (including any administrative fees provided for
herein and reasonable attorneys' fees), the amount thereof shall be immediately
due as of the date of such expenditure and, together with interest at the Agreed
Rate from the date of such expenditures, shall be paid by Tenant to Landlord
immediately upon demand, and Tenant hereby covenants to pay any and all such
sums,

     (e) If Tenant is not occupying the Premises, retain possession of all of
Tenant's fixtures, furniture, equipment, improvements, additions and other
personal property left in the Premises or, at Landlord's option, at any time, to
require Tenant to forthwith remove same, and if not so removed to deem them
abandoned and dispose of same.

     (f) Additional Remedies. Upon the occurrence of any of the events specified
in Sections 21 (d) or 21 (e), if Landlord shall elect not to exercise, or by law
shall not be able to exercise, its right hereunder to terminate this Lease,
then, in addition to any other rights or remedies of Landlord under this Lease
or provided by law, (i) Landlord shall not be obligated to provide Tenant with
any of the services specified in Section 12, or otherwise specified in the Lease
unless Landlord has received compensation in advance for such services, and the
parties agree that Landlord's reasonable estimate of the compensation required
with respect to such services shall control; and (ii) neither Tenant, as debtor
in possession, nor any trustee or other person (collectively, the "Assuming
                                                                  ---------
Tenant") shall be entitled to assume this Lease, unless on or before the date
- --------                                 
of such assumption, the Assuming Tenant (A) cures, or provides adequate
assurance that such Assuming Tenant will promptly cure, any existing default
under this Lease; (B) compensates, or provides adequate assurance that the
Assuming Tenant will promptly compensate Landlord for any loss (including,
without limitation, reasonable attorneys' fees and disbursements, including on
appeal and in connection with any bankruptcy) resulting from such default; and
(C) provides adequate assurance of future performance under this Lease. Tenant
covenants and agrees that, for such purposes (i) any cure or compensation
shall be effected by the immediate payment of any monetary default or any
required compensation, or the immediate correction acceptable to Landlord of
any nonmonetary default; (ii) any "adequate assurance" of such cure or

                                       24
<PAGE>
 
compensation shall be effected by the establishment of an escrow fund for the
amount at issue or by other method acceptable to Landlord; and (iii) "adequate
assurance" of future performance shall be effected by the establishment of an
escrow fund for the amount at issue or other method acceptable to Landlord.
Provided, further, upon the occurrence of any of the events specified in
Section 21(d) prior to the date fixed as the Commencement Date (whether or not
such default is cured within the time period, if any, provided in such
Section), this Lease shall ipso facto be cancelled and terminated. In such
event, (i) neither Tenant nor any person claiming through or under Tenant, or
by virtue of any statute or order of any court, shall be entitled to
possession of the Premises; and (ii) in addition to such other rights and
remedies provided in this Section 22, (A) Landlord may retain as damages any
Rent, Security Deposit (if any) or monies received from Tenant or others on
account of Tenant; and (B) the Concession Advance shall be immediately due and
payable. The foregoing is a material consideration to Landlord for the
execution of this Lease.

     All covenants and agreements to be performed by Tenant under this Lease
shall be performed by Tenant at Tenant's sole cost and expense and without any
offset to or abatement of Rent or Expenses.

23. DEFAULTS BY LANDLORD

     Landlord shall not be deemed to be in default in the performance of any
obligation under this Lease unless and until it has failed to perform such
obligation within thirty (30) days after receipt of written notice by Tenant to
Landlord specifying such failure; provided, however, that if the nature of
Landlord's default is such that more than thirty (30) days are required for its
cure, then Landlord shall not be deemed to be in default if it commences such
cure within the thirty (30) day period and thereafter diligently prosecutes such
cure to completion. Tenant agrees to give any Mortgagee a copy, by certified
mail, of any notice of default served upon Landlord, provided that prior to such
notice Tenant has been notified in writing (by way of Notice of Assignment of
Rents and Leases, or otherwise) of the address of such Mortgagee. Tenant further
agrees that if Landlord shall have failed to cure such default within the time
provided for in this Lease, then any such Mortgagee shall have an additional
forty-five (45) days within which to cure such default on the part of the
Landlord or if such default cannot be cured within that time, then such
additional time as may be necessary if within that forty-five (45) days the
Mortgagee has commenced and is pursuing the remedies necessary to cure such
default (including but not limited to commencement of foreclosure proceedings,
if necessary to effect such cure), in which event this Lease shall not be
terminated while such remedies are being so pursued. If Tenant recovers any
judgment against Landlord for a default by Landlord of this Lease, the
judgment shall be satisfied only out of the interest of Landlord in the
Project and neither Landlord nor any of its partners, shareholders, officers,
directors, employees or agents shall be personally liable for any such default
or for any deficiency.

                                       25
<PAGE>
 
24. COSTS OF SUIT

     If either party brings action for relief against the other, declaratory or
otherwise, arising out of this Lease, including any suit by Landlord for the
recovery of Rent or possession of the Premises, the losing party shall pay the
successful party its costs incurred in connection with and in preparation for
said action, including its reasonable attorneys' fees (which costs shall be
deemed to have accrued on the commencement of such action and shall be paid
whether or not such action is prosecuted to judgment, it being agreed that to be
the successful party a party need not necessarily have recovered a judgment, but
shall be the party which, in light of all the facts and circumstances of the
case, shall be deemed to be without fault or to have a lesser degree of fault
than the other party). If Landlord, without fault on Landlord's part, is made a
party to any action instituted by Tenant against a third party or by a third
party against Tenant or by or against any person holding under or using the
Premises by license of Tenant, or for the foreclosure of a lien for labor or
material furnished to or for Tenant or any such other person, or otherwise
arising out of or resulting from any act or omission of Tenant or of any such
other person, Tenant shall at its cost and at Landlord's option defend Landlord
therefrom and further, except to the extent Landlord is found separately liable
for its own negligence or wrongful acts, indemnify and hold Landlord harmless
from any judgment rendered in connection therewith and all costs and expenses
(including reasonable attorneys' fees) incurred by Landlord in connection with
such action.

25. SURRENDER OF PREMISES; HOLDING OVER

     (a) Surrender. On expiration or termination of this Lease, Tenant shall
surrender to Landlord the Premises, and all Tenant's improvements thereto and
alterations thereof, broom clean and in good condition (except for ordinary wear
and tear, destruction to the Premises covered by Section 18 of this Lease, and
for alterations that Tenant has the right to remove or is obligated to remove,
so long as Tenant repairs any damage to the Premises under the provisions of
this Section or Section 15), and shall remove all of its personal property
including any signs, notices and displays. Tenant shall perform all restoration
made necessary by the removal of any such improvements or alterations or
personal property, prior to the expiration of the Lease term. If any such
removal would damage the Building structure, Tenant shall give Landlord prior
written notice thereof and Landlord may elect to make such removal at Tenant's
expense or otherwise to require Tenant to post security for such restoration.
Landlord may retain or dispose of in any manner any such improvements or
alterations or personal property that Tenant does not remove from the Premises
on expiration or termination of the term as allowed or required by this Lease
and title to any such improvements or alterations or personal property that
Landlord so elects to retain or dispose of shall vest in Landlord for
Landlord's costs of storing, removing and disposing of any such improvements,
alterations or personal property which Tenant fails to remove from the
Premises. Tenant shall indemnify, defend and hold Landlord harmless from all
damages, loss, cost and expense (including reasonable attorneys' fees) arising
out of or in connection with Tenant's failure to surrender the Premises in
accordance with this Section.

                                       26
<PAGE>
 
     (b) Holding Over. If Tenant holds over after the term hereof, such
tenancy shall be at sufferance only, and not a renewal hereof or an extension
for any further term, and in such case Rent shall be payable at a rental in
the amount of two hundred percent (200%) of the Rent in effect as of the last
month of the term hereof and at the time specified in this Lease, and such
tenancy shall be subject to every other term, covenant and agreement contained
herein other than any provisions for rent concessions, Landlord's Work, or
optional rights of Tenant requiring Tenant to exercise same by written notice
(such as options to extend the term of the Lease). The foregoing shall not,
however, be construed as a consent by Landlord to any holding over by Tenant
and Landlord reserves the right to require Tenant to surrender possession of
the Premises upon expiration or termination of this Lease.

26. SURRENDER OF LEASE

     The voluntary or other surrender of this Lease by Tenant, or a mutual
cancellation thereof, shall not work as a merger. Such surrender or cancellation
shall, at the option of Landlord, terminate all or any existing subleases or
subtenancies, or may, at the option of Landlord, operate as an assignment to it
of any or all such subleases or subtenancies. The delivery of keys to the
Premises to Landlord or its agents shall not, of itself, constitute a surrender
and termination of this Lease.

27. TRANSFER OF LANDLORD'S INTEREST

     If Landlord sells or transfers its interest in the Premises (other than a
transfer for security purposes) Landlord shall be released from all obligations
and liabilities accruing thereafter under this Lease, if Landlord's successor
has assumed in writing Landlord's obligations under this Lease. Any Security
Deposit, prepaid Rent or other funds of Tenant in the hands of Landlord at the
time of transfer shall be delivered to such successor and Tenant agrees to
attorn to the purchaser or assignee, provided all Landlord's obligations
hereunder are assumed in writing by such successor. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, Landlord's successor shall not be liable to Tenant for any such funds
of Tenant which Landlord does not deliver to the successor.

28. ASSIGNMENT AND SUBLETTING

     (a) Landlord's Consent Required. Tenant shall not sell, assign, mortgage,
pledge, hypothecate or encumber this Lease (any such act being referred to
herein as an "assignment"), and shall not sublet the Premises or any part
             -------------                                               
thereof, without the prior written consent of Landlord in each instance, which
consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, and any attempt to do so without
such consent shall be voidable by Landlord and, at Landlord's election, shall
constitute a material default under this Lease.

     (b) Tenant's Application. If Tenant desires at any time to assign this
Lease (which assignment shall in no event be for less than its entire interest
in this Lease) or to sublet the Premises or any portion thereof, Tenant shall
submit to Landlord at least sixty (60) days prior to the proposed effective

                                       27
<PAGE>
 
date of the transaction ("Proposed Effective Date"), in writing, a notice of
                        ---------------------------                         
intent to assign or sublease, setting forth: (i) the Proposed Effective Date,
which shall be no less than sixty (60) nor more than ninety (90) days after
the sending of such notice; (ii) the name of the proposed subtenant or
assignee; (iii) the nature of the proposed subtenant's or assignee's business
to be carried on in the Premises; and (iv) a description of the terms and
provisions of the proposed sublease or assignment. Such notice shall be
accompanied by (i) such financial information as Landlord may request
concerning the proposed subtenant or assignee, including recent financial
statements and bank references; (ii) evidence satisfactory to Landlord that
the proposed subtenant or assignee will immediately occupy and thereafter use
the affected portion of the Premises for the entire term of the sublease or
assignment; (iii) a copy of the proposed sublease or assignment agreement; and
(iv) any fee required under Section 28(h). During the time that Landlord has
in which to exercise the options available to Landlord upon the giving of such
notice, as hereinafter described, Tenant shall not sublet all or any part of
the Premises nor assign all or any part of this Lease.

     (c) Landlord's Option to Recapture Premises. If Tenant proposes to sublease
all or part of the Premises for the balance of the Lease term, Landlord may, at
its option upon written notice to Tenant given within thirty (30) days after its
receipt of the above-described notice from Tenant, elect to recapture such
portion of the Premises as Tenant proposes to sublease and upon such election by
Landlord, this Lease shall terminate as to the portion of the Premises
recaptured. In the event a portion only of the Premises is recaptured, the
Rental payable under this Lease, the Security Deposit, and Tenant's Share shall
be proportionately reduced based on the rentable square footage retained by
Tenant and the rentable square footage leased by Tenant hereunder immediately
prior to such recapture and termination, and Landlord and Tenant shall thereupon
execute an amendment of this Lease in accordance therewith. If Landlord
recaptures only a portion of the Premises, it shall construct and erect at its
sole cost such partitions as may be required to sever the space retained by
Tenant from the space recaptured by Landlord; provided, however, that said
partitions need only be finished in Building Standard condition. Landlord may,
at is option, lease the recaptured portion of the Premises to the proposed
subtenant without liability to Tenant. If Landlord does not elect to recapture
pursuant to this Section, Tenant may thereafter enter into a valid sublease with
respect to the Premises, provided Landlord, pursuant to this Section, consents
thereto, and provided further that (i) the sublease is executed within ninety
(90) days after notification to Landlord of such proposal, and (ii) the rental
therefor is not less than that stated in such notification. Any termination as
provided in this Section 28(c) shall be subject to the written consent of any
Mortgagee of Landlord. The effective date of any such termination shall be the
Proposed Effective Date so long as Tenant has complied with the provisions of
Section 28(b) above, and otherwise shall be as specified in Landlord's notice
of termination.

     (d) Approval/Disapproval Standards. In the event that Tenant complies with
the provisions of Section 28(b), and Landlord does not exercise an option
provided to Landlord under Section 28(c), Landlord's consent to a proposed
assignment or sublease shall not be unreasonably withheld. In

                                       28
<PAGE>
 
determining whether to grant or withhold consent to a proposed assignment or
sublease, Landlord may consider any reasonable factor. Without limiting what
may be construed as a reasonable factor, it is hereby agreed that any one of
the following factors will be reasonable grounds for disapproval of a proposed
assignment or sublease:

       (i) Tenant has not complied with the requirements set forth in Section
28(b) above;

       (ii) The proposed assignee or subtenant does not, in Landlord's
reasonable judgment, have sufficient financial worth, considering the
responsibility involved;

       (iii) The proposed assignee or subtenant does not, in Landlord's
reasonable judgment, have a good reputation as a tenant of property;

       (iv) Landlord has had prior negative leasing experience with the proposed
assignee or subtenant;

       (v) The use of the Premises by the proposed assignee or subtenant will
not be identical to the use permitted by this Lease;

       (vi) In Landlord's reasonable judgment, the proposed assignee or
subtenant is engaged in a business, and the Premises, or the relevant part
thereof, will be used in a manner that is not in keeping with the then current
standards of the Building, or that will violate any restrictive or exclusive
covenant as to use contained in any other lease of space in the Building or the
Project;

       (vii) The use of the Premises by the proposed assignee or subtenant will
violate any applicable law, ordinance or regulation;

       (viii) The proposed assignee or subtenant, or any person that, directly
or indirectly, controls, is controlled by, or is under common control with, the
proposed assignee or subtenant, or any person who controls the proposed assignee
or subtenant, is then an occupant of a part of the Building or the Project;

       (ix) The proposed assignee or subtenant is a person with whom Landlord is
negotiating to lease space in the Building or the Project;

       (x) Tenant shall have advertised or publicized the availability of the
Premises without prior notice to, and approval by, Landlord;

       (xi) The proposed assignment or sublease fails to include all of the
terms and provisions required to be included therein pursuant to this Section;
or

                                       29
<PAGE>
 
       (xii) Tenant is then in default of any obligation of Tenant under this
Lease, or Tenant has defaulted under this Lease on three (3) or more occasions
during the twelve (12) months preceding the date that Tenant shall request
consent.

     (e) Approval/Disapproval Procedure. Landlord shall approve or disapprove
the proposed assignment or sublease by written notice to Tenant. If Landlord
shall exercise any option to recapture the Premises as herein provided, or
denies a request for consent to a proposed sublease or assignment, Landlord
shall not be liable to the proposed assignee or subtenant, or to any broker or
other person claiming a commission or similar compensation in connection with
the proposed assignment or sublease. If Landlord approves the proposed
assignment or sublease, Tenant shall, prior to the Proposed Effective Date,
submit to Landlord all executed originals of the assignment or sublease
agreement for execution by Landlord on the signature pages thereof after the
words "The foregoing is hereby consented to by Landlord." Provided such
assignment or sublease agreement is in accordance with the terms approved by
Landlord, Landlord shall execute each original as described above and shall
retain two originals for its file and return the others to Tenant. No purported
assignment or sublease shall be deemed effective as against Landlord and no
proposed assignee or subtenant shall take occupancy unless such document is
delivered to Landlord in accord with the foregoing.

     (f) Required Provisions. Any and all assignment or sublease agreements
shall (i) contain such terms as are described in Tenant's notice under Section
28(b) above or as otherwise agreed by Landlord, (ii) prohibit further
assignments or subleases, (iii) impose the same obligations and conditions on
the assignee or sublessee as are imposed on Tenant by this Lease except as to
Rent and term or as otherwise agreed by Landlord, (iv) be expressly subject and
subordinate to each and every provision of this Lease, (v) have a term that
expires on or before the expiration of the term of this Lease, (vi) provide that
if Landlord succeeds to sublessor's position, Landlord shall not be liable to
sublessee for advance rental payments, deposits or other payments which have not
been actually delivered to Landlord by the sublessor, and (vii) provide that
Tenant and/or the assignee or sublessee shall pay Landlord the amount of any
additional costs or expenses incurred by Landlord for repairs, maintenance or
otherwise as a result of any change in the nature of occupancy caused by the
assignment or sublease. Any and all sublease agreements shall also provide
that in the event of termination, re-entry, or dispossession by Landlord under
this Lease, Landlord may, at its option, take over all of the right, title and
interest of Tenant as sublessor under such sublease, and such subtenant shall,
at Landlord's option, attorn to Landlord pursuant to the then executory
provisions of the sublease, except that Landlord shall not: (i) be liable for
any previous act or omission of Tenant under the sublease; (ii) be subject to
any offset not expressly provided in the sublease, that theretofore accrued to
the subtenant against Tenant; or (iii) be bound by any previous modification
of such sublease or by any previous prepayment of more than one (1) month's
fixed rent or any additional rent then due.

                                       30
<PAGE>
 
     (g) Payment of Additional Rent Upon Assignment or Sublease. If Landlord
shall give its consent to any assignment of this Lease or to any sublease of the
Premises, Tenant shall, in consideration therefor, pay to Landlord, as
additional Rent:

       (i)   In the case of an assignment, an amount equal to all sums and other
consideration paid to Tenant by the assignee for, or by reason of, such
assignment (including, without limiting the generality of the foregoing, all
sums paid for the sale of Tenant's leasehold improvements); and

       (ii)  In the case of a sublease, any rents, additional charges, or other
consideration payable under the sublease by the subtenant to Tenant that are in
excess of the Rent and Tenant's Share of Expenses accruing during the term of
the sublease in respect of the subleased space (at the rate per square foot
payable by Tenant hereunder) pursuant to the terms hereof (including, without
limiting the generality of the foregoing, all sums paid for the sale or rental
of Tenant's leasehold improvements).

     The sums payable under subsection (i) above shall be paid to Landlord upon
the effective date of the assignment. The sums payable under subsection (ii)
above shall be paid to Landlord as and when payable by the sublessee to Tenant.
Within fifteen (15) days after written request therefor by Landlord, Tenant
shall at any time and from time to time furnish evidence to Landlord of the
amount of all such sums or other consideration received or expected to be
received.

     (h) Fees for Review. Simultaneously with the giving of the notice described
in Section 28(b) above, Tenant shall pay to Landlord or Landlord's designee a
non-refundable fee in the amount of Three Hundred Dollars ($300.00) as
reimbursement for expenses incurred by Landlord in connection with reviewing
each such transaction. In addition to such reimbursement, if Landlord retains
the services of an attorney to review the transaction, Tenant shall pay to
Landlord the reasonable attorneys' fees incurred by Landlord in connection
therewith. Tenant shall pay such attorneys' fees to Landlord within fifteen (15)
days after written request therefor.

       (i)   No Release of Tenant. No consent by Landlord to any assignment or
subletting by Tenant shall relieve Tenant of any obligation to be performed by
Tenant under this Lease, whether occurring before or after such consent,
assignment or subletting, including Tenant's obligation to obtain Landlord's
express prior written consent to any other assignment or subletting. In no event
shall any permitted subtenant assign its sublease, further sublet all or any
portion of is sublet space, or otherwise suffer or permit the sublet space, or
any part thereof, to be used or occupied by others, except upon compliance with,
and subject to the provisions of this Section. The acceptance by Landlord of
payment from any person other than Tenant shall not be deemed to be a waiver by
Landlord of any provision of this Lease or to be a consent to any subsequent
assignment or sublease, or to be a release of Tenant from any obligation under
this Lease.

                                       31
<PAGE>
 
       (i)   Assumption of Obligations. Each assignee of Tenant shall assume the
obligations of Tenant under this Lease and shall be and remain liable jointly
and severally with Tenant for the payment of the Rent and the performance of
all the terms, covenants, conditions and agreements herein contained on
Tenant's part to be performed for the term of this Lease. No assignment shall
be binding on Landlord unless the assignee or Tenant delivers to Landlord a
counterpart of this instrument of assignment in recordable form which contains
a covenant of assumption by the assignee satisfactory in substance and form to
Landlord, and consistent with the requirements of this Section. The failure or
refusal of the assignee to execute such instrument of assumption shall not
release or discharge the assignee from its liability to Landlord hereunder.
Landlord shall have no obligation whatsoever to perform any duty to or respond
to any request from any sublessee, it being the obligation of Tenant to
administer the terms of its subleases.

     (k) Corporate or Partnership Transfers. If the Tenant is a privately held
corporation, or is an unincorporated association or partnership, the cumulative
or aggregate transfer, assignment or hypothecation of fifty percent (50%) or
more of the total stock or interest in such corporation, association or
partnership shall be deemed an assignment or sublease within the meaning and
provisions of this Section. This Section shall, however, not apply to
assignments or subleases to a corporation (i) into or with which Tenant is
merged or consolidated, (ii) to which substantially all of Tenant's assets are
transferred, or (iii) that controls, is controlled by, or is under common
control with Tenant, provided that, in any of such events:

       (i)   The successor of Tenant has a net worth, computed in accordance 
with generally accepted accounting principles, at least equal to the greater
of (a) the net worth of Tenant immediately prior to such merger, consolidation
or transfer, or (b) the net worth of Tenant herein named on the date of this
Lease;

       (ii)  Proof satisfactory to Landlord of such net worth shall have been
delivered to Landlord at least ten (10) days prior to the effective date of such
transaction;

       (iii) Any such assignment or sublease shall be subject to all of the
terms and provisions of this Lease, and such assignee or sublessee shall
assume, in a written document reasonably satisfactory to Landlord and
delivered to Landlord promptly upon the assignment or sublease, all the
obligations of Tenant under this Lease;

       (iv)  Tenant shall remain fully liable for all obligations to be 
performed by Tenant under this Lease; and

       (v)   Tenant shall reimburse Landlord, promptly on demand, for Landlord's
reasonable attorneys' fees incurred in conjunction with the processing and
documentation of any such transaction.

                                       32
<PAGE>
 
     (l) Involuntary Assignment. No interest of Tenant in this Lease shall be
assignable by operation of law (including without limitation, the transfer of
this Lease by testacy or intestacy, or in any bankruptcy or insolvency
proceeding). Each of the following acts shall be considered an involuntary
assignment: (i) If Tenant is or becomes bankrupt or insolvent, makes an
assignment for the benefit of creditors, or institutes a proceeding under any
bankruptcy law in which Tenant is the bankrupt; or, if Tenant is a partnership
or consists of more than one person or entity, if any partner of the
partnership or other such person or entity is or becomes bankrupt or
insolvent, or makes an assignment for the benefit of creditors; (ii) If a writ
of attachment or execution is levied on this Lease; (iii) If, in any
proceeding or action to which Tenant is a party, a receiver is appointed with
authority to take possession of the Premises; or (iv) there is any assumption,
assignment, sublease or other transfer under or pursuant to the Bankruptcy
Code, 11 U.S.C. 101 et seq. (hereinafter referred to as the "Bankruptcy
                                                            -----------
Code"). An involuntary assignment shall constitute a default by Tenant and
- ------
Landlord shall have the right to elect to terminate this Lease, in which case
this Lease shall not be treated as an asset of Tenant. If Landlord shall elect
not to exercise its right hereunder to terminate this Lease in the event of an
involuntary assignment, then in addition to any other rights or remedies of
Landlord under this Lease or provided by law, the provisions of Sections
28(c), (f), (g), (h), (i), (j) and (m) shall apply to any such involuntary
assignment. Such sums, if any, payable pursuant to the referenced Sections
shall be and remain the exclusive property of Landlord and shall not
constitute property of Tenant or of the estate of Tenant within the meaning of
the Bankruptcy Code. Such sums which are not paid or delivered to Landlord
shall be held in trust for the benefit of Landlord, and shall be promptly paid
or turned over to Landlord upon demand. Any person or entity to which this
Lease is assigned pursuant to the provisions of said Code shall be deemed
without further act or deed to have assumed all of the obligations of Tenant
arising under this Lease on and after the date of such assignment. Any such
assignee shall upon demand execute and deliver such instruments and documents
reasonably requested by Landlord confirming such assumption.

     (m) Assignment of Sublease Rents. Tenant immediately and irrevocably
assigns to Landlord, as security for Tenant's obligations under this Lease, all
rent from any subletting of all or any part of the Premises, and Landlord, as
assignee and as attorney-in-fact for Tenant for purposes hereof, or a receiver
for Tenant appointed on Landlord's application, may collect such rents and
apply same toward Tenant's obligations under this Lease; except that, until
the occurrence of an act of default by Tenant, Tenant shall have the right and
license to collect such rents.

29. ATTORNMENT

     If any proceeding is brought for default under any ground or underlying
lease to which this Lease is subject, or in the event of foreclosure or the
exercise of the power of sale under any mortgage or deed of trust made by
Landlord covering the Premises, Tenant shall attorn to the successor upon any
such foreclosure or sale and shall recognize that successor as Landlord under
this Lease, provided such successor expressly agrees in writing to be bound to
all future obligations by the

                                       33
<PAGE>
 
terms of this Lease, and, if so requested, Tenant shall enter into a new lease
with that successor on the same terms and conditions as are contained in this
Lease, for the unexpired term of this Lease then remaining,

30. SUBORDINATION

     Without the necessity of any additional document being executed by Tenant
for the purpose of effecting a subordination, this Lease shall be subject and
subordinate at all times to: (i) all ground or underlying leases which may now
exist or hereafter be executed affecting the Premises, and (ii) the lien of any
first mortgage or first deed of trust which may now exist or hereafter be
executed in any amount for which the Premises, such ground or underlying leases,
or Landlord's interest or estate in any of them, is specified as security.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, Landlord shall have the right to subordinate or
cause to be subordinated any such ground or underlying leases or any such liens
to this Lease. If any ground or underlying lease terminates for any reason,
Tenant shall, notwithstanding any subordination, attorn to and become Tenant of
the successor in interest to Landlord at the option of such successor in
interest, Tenant covenants and agrees to execute and deliver, upon demand by
Landlord and in the form requested by Landlord, any documents evidencing the
priority or subordination of this Lease with respect to any such ground or
underlying leases or the lien of any such first mortgage or first deed of trust,
and specifically to execute, acknowledge, and deliver to Landlord from time to
time within ten (10) days after written request to do so a subordination of
lease, or a subordination of deed of trust, in substantially the form set forth
in Exhibit D or D-1 respectively, attached hereto, or such other form as may be
   ---------    ---                                                            
customarily required by any Mortgagee of Landlord, and failure of Tenant to do
so shall be a material default hereunder. Tenant hereby irrevocably appoints
Landlord as its attorney-in-fact to execute, deliver, and record any such
documents in the name and on behalf of Tenant if Tenant fails to comply with the
foregoing,

31. ESTOPPEL CERTIFICATE

     Tenant shall from time to time within ten (10) days after prior written
notice from Landlord execute, acknowledge and deliver to Landlord a statement in
writing in the form set forth in Exhibit E attached hereto, or such other form
                                 --------                                     
as may be customarily required by Landlord's Mortgagee, (i) certifying that
this Lease is unmodified and in full force and effect (or, if modified,
stating the nature of such modification and certifying that this Lease, as so
modified, is in full force and effect) and the date to which the Rent and
other charges are paid in advance, if any, (ii) acknowledging that there are
not, to Tenant's knowledge, any uncured defaults on the part of Landlord
hereunder, (or specifying such defaults if they are claimed), and (iii)
containing such other matters as are set forth in such form. Any such
statement may be conclusively relied upon by any prospective purchaser or
encumbrancer of the Premises. Tenant's failure to deliver such statement
within such time shall be conclusive upon Tenant that this Lease is in full
force and effect, without modification except as may be represented by
Landlord, that there are no uncured defaults in Landlord's performance, and
that not more than one

                                       34
<PAGE>
 
month's Rent has been paid in advance. Failure of Tenant to so deliver such
statement shall be a material default hereunder. Tenant hereby irrevocably
appoints Landlord as its attorney-in-fact to execute and deliver such
statement to any third party in the name and on behalf of Tenant if Tenant
fails to comply with the foregoing.

32. BUILDING OCCUPANCY PLANNING

     Notwithstanding any contrary provision of this Lease, if Landlord requires
the Premises for use in conjunction with another suite or for other reasons
related to Landlord's occupancy plans for the Building, then upon at least
thirty (30) days' prior written notice to Tenant, Landlord shall have the right
to move Tenant to other space in the Building, and thereupon such other space
shall be deemed to be the Premises covered by this Lease. The expense of moving
Tenant, its property and equipment to the substituted space and of improving
same to a condition similar to the then current condition of the Premises shall
be born by Landlord. If the substituted space is smaller or larger than the
Premises the Basic Rent, Security Deposit and Tenant's Share specified in this
Lease shall be adjusted proportionately, and Landlord and Tenant shall execute
an amendment to this Lease in accordance therewith. However, if the substituted
space does not meet with Tenant's approval, Tenant may cancel this Lease upon
thirty (30) days' prior written notice to Landlord, given within ten (10) days
after Tenant's receipt of Landlord's notice referred to above.

33. QUIET ENJOYMENT

     So long as Tenant pays all Rent and other sums due under this Lease,
performs its covenants and obligations under this Lease and recognizes any
successor to Landlord in accordance with the terms of this Lease, Tenant shall
lawfully and quietly have, hold and enjoy the Premises without hindrance or
molestation by Landlord or anyone claiming by, through or under Landlord,
subject, however, to all the provisions of this Lease.

34. WAIVER OF REDEMPTION BY TENANT

     Tenant hereby waives for Tenant and for all those claiming under Tenant all
right now or hereafter existing to redeem by order or judgment of any court or
by any legal process or writ, Tenant's right of occupancy of the Premises after
any termination of this Lease.

35. WAIVER OF LANDLORD: TENANT'S PROPERTY

     Landlord shall, within thirty (30) days after written request from Tenant,
execute and deliver to Tenant any statement in form acceptable to Landlord as
may be required by any supplier, lessor, installment seller or chattel mortgagee
in connection with the installation in the Premises of any personal property or
trade fixtures of Tenant, pursuant to which Landlord shall agree to waive any

                                       35
<PAGE>
 
rights it may have or may acquire with respect to any such property, provided
in all cases that such supplier, lessor, installment seller or chattel
mortgagee expressly agrees in writing that: (i) It will remove at its sole
cost and expense all such property from the Premises before the expiration or
termination of the Lease and if it fails to do so within ten (10) days after
written request from Landlord it shall be deemed to have waived any and all
rights it may have had to such property; (ii) Prior to making any such removal
it will advise Landlord in writing of the date and time of such removal and
will, at the time of such removal, allow a representative of Landlord to be
present; (iii) It will promptly and diligently and at its sole cost and
expense repair any and all damage to the Premises attributable to such removal
and shall restore the Premises to substantially the same condition it was in
prior to such removal; (iv) It will allow Landlord to select the person or
persons which will effect such removal, repair and restoration, and will bear
the costs and expenses thereof; (v) It will, if Landlord chooses to exercise
its rights under (iv) above, cause a performance and completion bond,
satisfactory to Landlord, to be furnished to Landlord with regard to the work
of such removal, repair and restoration; (vi) It will promptly pay Landlord
any costs and expenses incurred by Landlord in connection with the enforcement
of Landlord's rights hereunder, including attorneys' fees, and will indemnify
and hold Landlord harmless against any and all claims, loss, cost or expense
arising out of or in connection with such removal, repair and restoration;
(vii) It will pay Landlord interest on any outstanding amounts payable by it
to Landlord at the "Agreed Rate" (as hereinafter defined); (viii) It will not
record such statement without Landlord's prior written consent which Landlord
may withhold in its sole discretion; and (ix) It will not assign its rights or
delegate its duties under such statement without Landlord's prior written
consent.

36. RULES AND REGULATIONS

     The Rules and Regulations attached hereto as Exhibit F are expressly made a
                                                  ---------                     
part hereof. Tenant agrees to comply with such Rules and Regulations and any
reasonable amendments, modifications or additions thereto as may hereafter be
adopted and published by notice to tenants in the Building, and to cause its
agents, contractors and employees to comply therewith, and agrees that the
violation of any of them shall constitute a default by Tenant under this Lease.
If there is a conflict between the Rules and Regulations and any of the
provisions of this Lease, the Provisions of this Lease shall prevail. Landlord
shall not be responsible to Tenant for the non-performance by any other tenant
or occupant of the Building or of the Project of any of the Rules and
Regulations.

37. NOTICES

     Any notice, demand or communication required or permitted to be given
hereunder to Landlord by Tenant shall be personally served or deposited in the
United States mails, duly registered or certified with postage fully prepaid
thereon, addressed to Landlord at Landlord's address as set forth in Section 1
hereof, or to such other address to which Tenant last forwarded Rent, or to such
other parties as Landlord may from time to time designate. Any notice, demand or
communication required or

                                       36
<PAGE>
 
permitted to be given hereunder to Tenant by Landlord may be mailed as above
stated to Tenant's address as set forth in Section 1 hereof or delivered
personally to Tenant at the address of the Premises. Either party may by
written notice similarly given designate a different address for notice
purposes, except that Landlord may in any event use the Premises as Tenant's
address for notice purposes. Notice shall be effective when mailed or
delivered as above specified.

38. WAIVER

     No delay or omission in the exercise of any right or remedy of Landlord for
any default by Tenant shall impair such right or remedy or be construed as a
waiver. The receipt and acceptance by Landlord of delinquent payments shall not
constitute a waiver of any other default, and shall not constitute a waiver of
timely payment of the particular payment involved. No act or conduct of
Landlord, including, without limitation, the acceptance of keys to the Premises,
shall constitute an acceptance of the surrender of the Premises by Tenant before
the expiration of the term. Only an express notice to such effect from Landlord
to Tenant shall constitute acceptance of the surrender of the Premises
sufficient to terminate this Lease. Landlord's consent to or approval of any act
by Tenant requiring Landlord's consent or approval shall not constitute a
consent or approval of any subsequent act by Tenant. Any waiver by Landlord of
any default must be in writing and shall not be a waiver of any default
concerning the same or any other provision of this Lease.

39. MISCELLANEOUS

     (a) Execution by Landlord. The submission of this document for examination
and negotiation does not constitute an offer to lease, or a reservation of, or
an option for, the Premises, This document becomes effective and binding only

agent of Landlord or of Landlord's broker shall alter, change or modify any of
the provisions hereof.

periods of ownership of the Premises.

appropriate.

     (e) Name of Building. Tenant shall not use the name of the Building or the
Project for any purpose other than the address of the business to be conducted
by Tenant in the Premises. Tenant shall not use any picture of the Building or
the Project in its advertising, stationery or in any manner so as to imply that
the entire Building is leased by Tenant. Landlord expressly reserves the right
at any time to change the name of the Building or Project without in any manner
being liable to Tenant therefor,

Landlord has made any representation or warranty as to the suitability of the
parking areas for the conduct of Tenant's business.

shall be deemed a material part of the consideration for Landlord's execution of
this Lease. If the guarantor under any such guarantee is or becomes bankrupt or
insolvent, makes an assignment for the benefit of creditors, or institutes or is
the subject of any proceeding under the Bankruptcy Code or other similar law for
the protection of creditors (or, if the guarantor is a partnership or consists
of more than one person or entity, if any partner of the partnership or such
other person or entity is or becomes bankrupt or insolvent, institutes any such
proceeding, or makes an assignment for the benefit of creditors), then Landlord
shall have the option to terminate this Lease upon thirty (30) days written
notice unless Tenant, within such thirty (30) day period, provides Landlord with
either (i) a substitute or additional

                                       38
<PAGE>
 
guarantor satisfactory to Landlord and any Mortgagee of Landlord, or (ii)

for any and all loss, cost, damage, or expense (including without limitation
reasonable attorneys' fees) which Landlord may sustain or incur as a result of
or in connection with Tenant's unreasonable failure or delay in executing,
acknowledging and delivering such documents, or Tenant's breach of any other
covenant or agreement embodied in this Lease that results in the delay,
impairment or cancellation of Landlord's financing.

     (j) Nonrecordability of Lease. Tenant agrees that in no event shall this
Lease or a memorandum hereof be recorded without Landlord's express prior
written consent.

     (k) Matters of Record. This Lease and Tenant's rights hereunder are subject
and subordinate in all respects to matters affecting Landlord's title recorded
in the official records of the county recorder's office for the county in which
the Project is located prior or subsequent to the date of execution of this
Lease, and is expressly subject and subordinate to the Declaration of Covenants,
Conditions and Restrictions dated November 9, 1971, and recorded on December 8,
1971, as Document No. 3663 in Book M-3918, Page 76 of the Official Records of

leasehold estate it, and all persons in possession or holding under it, will

determined by a court of competent jurisdiction to be invalid or unenforceable,
the remainder of this Lease shall not be affected thereby, and every other term
and provision of this Lease shall be valid and enforceable to the fullest extent
permitted by law.

jury in any action, proceeding or counterclaim brought by either against the

money and property of any kind or description, including, without limitation,
the Security Deposit, if any, and any advance Rental payment or other deposit,
now in or hereafter delivered to or coming into the possession, custody or
control of Landlord, by or for the account of Tenant, in any manner and for any

                           PARKING LICENSE AGREEMENT

     SAKIOKA FARMS, a California General Partnership ("Licensor") hereby grants
     to WORLD FLIGHT CREW SERVICES, INC., a Delaware corporation ("Licensee")
     the right and license to use parking spaces in LAX BUSINESS CENTER (the
     "Project") as described below and subject to the following conditions:

     1. Type and Number of Parking Spaces: Licensee shall have the right to
use up to five (5) unassigned automobile parking spaces. If the area of
Licensee's Premises in the Project is reduced, Licensee's allotment of parking
spaces will be adjusted proportionately. If the area of Licensee's Premises is
increased, Licensee may, at its option, increase the number of its allotted
parking spaces proportionately. Notwithstanding the preceding, Licensee shall
have no right to use any number of parking spaces in excess of the number of
employees of Licensee actually employed at the Premises.

     2. Monthly Fee: Licensee shall pay for the right and license granted hereby
the prevailing rates charged for such spaces by Licensor from time to time
("market rate"). Such sums shall be payable in advance on the first day of each
- ---------------                                                                
calendar month. Licensor shall have no obligation to accept any such payment
from anyone other than Licensee (e.g. Licensee's employees, subtenants, etc.) If
Licensee fails to make any such payment when due, Licensor, at its option and
after five (5) days' notice to Licensee, may forthwith terminate this license
and all rights of Licensee hereunder. Any late payment of the monthly fee will
result in additional administrative and processing costs being incurred by
Licensor, the exact amount of which would be extremely difficult to determine,
and it is agreed that with respect thereto a late fee of Ten Dollars ($10.00)
per space is a reasonable estimate thereof and will be payable by Licensee with
regard to any monthly fee not paid when due.

     3. Term: Licensee shall been entitled to the foregoing parking rights for a
period equivalent to the term of that certain "Lease" of Premises in the Project
entered into by Licensor and Licensee. Licensee's rights to any and all parking
spaces shall automatically be revoked and shall terminate upon any material
default hereunder, or any expiration or termination of said Lease, as well as
upon any assignment of such Lease or sublease of such Premises, in violation
of the terms of such Lease. Licensee must exercise its rights under this
Agreement by delivering all required security deposits and the initial monthly
fee for the parking spaces described above within thirty (30) days after the
"Commencement Date" of the aforementioned Lease unless otherwise agreed by
Licensor. Failure of Licensee to so exercise its rights will entitle Licensor
without notice to transfer to others Licensee's rights to park in any and all
parking spaces as to which Licensee has not so exercised its rights hereunder,
and Licensee will be deemed to have waived its rights hereunder with regard
thereto.

     4. Location of Parking Spaces: Licensor shall have the right in its sole
discretion to designate the particular location of said parking space(s),
which designation is subject to change from time to time.

     5. Rights Non-Transferrable: The foregoing parking rights are personal to
Licensee and Licensee shall not assign, convey, or otherwise transfer said
rights in any manner whatsoever without Licensor's prior written consent. Any
attempt by Licensee to do so shall be null and void and, at Licensor's election,
shall constitute a material default hereunder, If the Premises or any portion
thereof

  P-1
<PAGE>
 
is assigned or sublet pursuant to the terms of the Lease, the number or parking
spaces allotted to Licensee under paragraph 1 hereof shall automatically be
adjusted accordingly and Licensor and Licensee shall immediately execute an
amendment to this Agreement setting forth (i) the number of spaces retained by
Licensee, (ii) the number of spaces allotted to Licensee's assignee or subtenant
(which number shall not exceed the amount stated in paragraph 1 above), (iii)
the then current "market rate" to be charged Licensee for the spaces allotted to
its assignee or subtenant, and (iv) the security deposit to be paid by Licensee
for its assignee's or subtenant's parking cards.

     6. Licensee Indemnification: Use of said parking spaces and of the parking
areas in the Project shall be at the sole risk of Licensee. Unless caused by the
negligence or wrongful acts of Licensor, its agents or employees, Licensee
hereby agrees to defend, indemnify and hold Licensor harmless against any
liability, loss, cost or expense (including reasonable attorneys' fees) for any
damage to or loss or theft of any vehicle or property within any vehicle or any
other property (including property of Licensee), or injury to or death of any
person (including Licensee and Licensee's family, agents, employees, visitors or
customers), arising directly or indirectly out of or in connection with the use
by Licensee or such other persons of the parking areas or any part thereof.

     7. Interruption of Use: Licensor shall not be liable to Licensee for any
Interruption or Licensee's use of the rights granted hereunder due to repairs,
improvements or alterations of the parking areas or the Project, or due to any
labor controversy, or resulting from any cause beyond the reasonable control of
Licensor. However, Licensee shall be entitled to an abatement of the monthly fee
with regard to any assigned parking space to the extent it is prevented from
using such space and no reasonably similar alterative space is made available to
it by Licensor.

     8. Rules and Regulations: Licensor's parking rules and regulations are
attached hereto. Licensor may adopt such other rules and regulations relating to
the use of the parking areas as in Licensor's opinion are necessary or desirable
for the proper, orderly and safe use of the parking areas. If Licensee fails to
comply with the rules and regulations and modifications thereto after receiving
notice thereof, Licensor may at its option forthwith terminate this license
and all rights of Licensee hereunder, and may also, whether or not such license
is so terminated, take such action as shall be required to remedy such failure,
and Licensee agrees to pay Licensor on demand the reasonable cost to Licensor of
such actions including attorneys' fees. Licensee shall at all time be required
to park in a lawful manner, and no vehicle shall at any time be parked in more
than one marked space at a time. Licensor shall be entitled to tow away any
vehicle which is improperly parked, at the vehicle owner's sole cost and
expense. In the event of such tow away, neither Licensor nor any Mortgagee of
Licensor shall have any liability therefor to Licensee or to such vehicle owner.

     9. Licensor's Property Rights: Licensor shall have the right to decrease
the size of any of the parking areas in the Project, to alter or rearrange
parking spaces and improvements in the parking areas, to take all or any
portion of the parking areas for purposes of maintaining, repairing or
restoring same, or for purposes of construction and operating structures
thereon or adjacent thereto, to have ingress and egress in connection with the
exercise of any such rights, and to do and perform such other acts with
respect to the parking areas as Licensor shall in its discretion deem
appropriate. Licensor may at any time and from time to time in its discretion
designate any portion of the parking areas in the Project for use as assigned
parking, visitor parking or employee parking. If Licensor

  P-2
<PAGE>
 
establishes an "employee parking" area or other assigned parking area for
Licensee's employees to park in, Licensee shall furnish Licensor, within five
(5) days after written request to do so, with a list of the vehicle license
numbers of Licensee's employees parking in the project. Licensor may charge
Licensee Ten Dollars ($10.00) per day for each day or partial day for each
vehicle parked by Licensee or any of its employees in a parking space or area
other than the space or parking area assigned or designated for such vehicle.
Licensor may tow away any such improperly parked vehicles and may also attach
violation notices or stickers to improperly parked vehicles. In the event of
such tow away, neither Licensor nor any Mortgagee of Licensor shall have any
liability therefor to Licensee or to such vehicle owner.

    10. Security Deposit: If parking is in a controlled lot, a monthly parking
card or decal may be issued to Licensee for each parking space to be used by
Licensee hereunder. Licensee will pay a security deposit for each parking card
at the time of issuance of the card. Licensor shall have no obligation to accept
any such security deposit from anyone other than Licensee. The security deposit
shall be held by Licensor to secure Licensee's due performance of its
obligations with regard to parking hereunder and the return to Licensor of such
parking card(s) in good condition, normal wear and tear excepted, upon
termination of Licensee's rights hereunder. Licensee shall be obligated to take
reasonable steps to protect such cards from warping or mutilation. Without
limitation as to the generality of the foregoing, Licensor may apply such
security deposit to remedy any default by Licensee hereunder and further, if
such card(s) are lost or mutilated, Licensor may apply any or all of said
deposit toward Licensor's cost of such card(s). If at any time Licensor applies
any or all of such security deposit as provided herein, Licensee shall be
obligated to deposit with Licensor the amount so applied by Licensor within ten
(10) days after written request therefor is given. Upon termination of
Licensee's rights hereunder and the return to Licensor of the aforementioned
card(s) (or cards issued in substitution thereof) the security deposit or
balance thereof shall be returned to Licensee provided Licensee is not then in
default hereunder. Licensor need not hold said security deposit in a separate
account.

    11. Replacement Cards: If for any reason (other than a malfunction for which
Licensee is not responsible hereunder any card issued to Licensee is requested
by Licensee to be replaced, Licensee shall pay Licensor the then current non-
refundable charge for said replacement card.

    12. Miscellaneous: No waiver by Licensor or any breach of this agreement by
Licensee shall constitute a waiver of any other breach. Any amount due to
Licensor that is not paid when due shall bear interest at the maximum rate
allowable under law. In the event of any legal action taken or proceeding
brought to enforce the provisions hereof, the prevailing party shall be entitled
to recover its reasonable attorneys' fees and costs incurred in connection
therewith.

security for Lessee's performance of its obligations hereunder.  Upon return of
the Aircraft to Lessor in full compliance with Section 15, including the return
conditions specified therein, and provided that all unpaid Rent has been paid,
Lessor shall refund the Security Deposit to Lessee.  Lessee may substitute a
Letter of Credit from a bank acceptable to Lessor and in form and substance

business as an air carrier in all jurisdictions in which it has air routes,
except for jurisdictions where failure to so qualify or obtain authorization
would not have a material adverse effect on the business of Lessee and would not
involve any material danger of the sale, forfeiture or loss of any Item of
Equipment or the impairment of the value thereof.

            (b)  Authority.  Lessee has full corporate power and authority to
                 ---------                                                   
enter into and perform this Lease and the Lease Supplement; and the execution,

authorized by all necessary corporate action on the part of Lessee, do not
require any stockholder approval or approval or consent of any trustee or
holders of any Debt or other obligations of Lessee except such as have been duly

            (c) Governmental Approvals.  Except for the filing of this Lease
                ----------------------                                      
and the Lease Supplement with the FAA, neither the making nor performance by
Lessee of this Lease or the Lease Supplement, nor the consummation of any of the
transactions by Lessee contemplated hereby or thereby, nor the acquisition,
ownership or leasing by Lessor of the

of notice to, the registration or filing for recordation with, or the taking
of any other action in respect of, the Government or any political agency,
subdivision or instrumentality thereof, except such as have been obtained,

            (d) Binding Obligations. This Lease constitutes the valid and 
                -------------------
legally binding obligation of Lessee enforceable against Lessee in accordance
with the terms hereof.

            (e) Litigation. Except as otherwise disclosed in the Lessee's most
                ----------

the knowledge of Lessee, threatened in any court or before any regulatory
commission, board or other administrative or governmental agency against or
affecting Lessee which relate to the transactions contemplated hereby or which,
if adversely determined, would have a material adverse affect on the ability
of Lessor to perform its obligations hereunder.

            (f) Financial Condition.  The audited balance sheet of Lessee as of
                -------------------
December 31, 1991 (the "1991 Balance Sheet"), and the audited statements of
profit and loss of Lessee for 1991, each certified by KPMG Peat Marwick,
together with the unaudited financial statements of Lessee for the period ending
September 30, 1992, fairly present the financial condition of Lessee and have
been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles.
Lessee has no contingent obligations, liabilities for taxes or unusual forward
or long-term commitments which could have a material adverse effect on its
financial condition, except as disclosed in the 1991 Balance Sheet. Since
September 30, 1992, there has been no material adverse change in Lessee's
operations or financial condition from that reflected in such financial
statements other than changes in the ordinary course of business the effect of
which has not been materially adverse to the ability of Lessee to fulfill its
obligations hereunder, other than the sale of Key Airlines.

States and any other jurisdictions in which Lessee conducts its operations.

            (h) Pari Passu Ranking. The obligations of Lessee to pay Rent
                ------------------                                       
hereunder will be direct and unconditional general obligations of Lessee, and
will rank in right of payment at least pari passu with all unsecured obligations
of Lessee.

            (i) No Conflicting Agreements. Lessee is not a party to any 
                -------------------------
agreement or instrument or subject to any charter or other corporate
restriction which individually or in the aggregate is, in the reasonable
judgment of Lessee, likely to materially adversely affect its ability to
perform its obligations under this Lease or the Lease Supplement.

            (j) No Default. No Default or Event of Default has occurred and is
                ----------                                                    
continuing.

representatives or similar officials, under any bankruptcy or liquidation law

agreement, lease or sublease, and Lessee shall remain primarily liable
hereunder for the performance of all of the terms hereof to the same extent as
if such transfer had not occurred. Any transfer of an Engine pursuant to this
Section 6. 1 which results in a transfer of title to such Engine shall be
treated as an Event of Loss with respect to such Engine. Lessor agrees to
enter into the Cooperation Agreement in the form of Exhibit G hereto.

      If applicable law requires that the Aircraft be registered in a
jurisdiction other than the United States during the term of any permitted
sublease the Aircraft may be registered in such other jurisdiction provided
that notwithstanding such reregistration, all of the other terms and
conditions of this Lease are complied with and such sublessee provides Lessor
with evidence, reasonably satisfactory to Lessor and Mortgagee, including
opinions of counsel reasonably acceptable to Lessor, that Lessor and Mortgagee
will retain substantially all of the same rights and protections under this
Lease and the Mortgage, respectively and with respect to the Aircraft as if
the Aircraft had not been so reregistered. Lessor shall

                                       17
<PAGE>
 
have the right to require Lessee to carry "political risk" insurance of the
Aircraft is registered in a jurisdiction outside the United States. Promptly
after the end of such sublease, the Aircraft, the Lease and the Mortgage shall
be reregistered and refiled with the FAA at the Lessee's expense.

      6.2. Assignment: Sublease. Lessee may enter into a wet lease of the
           --------------------                                          
Airframe or Aircraft with any third party, provided that the operation of the
Airframe or Aircraft remains in the exclusive control of Lessee's employees
possessing all current certificates and licenses necessary for operation
thereof. Lessee may also sublease the Aircraft to any Permitted Sublessee.
Lessee shall notify Lessor of any contemplated wet lease or sublease as many
days prior to the commencement thereof as may be practical and shall provide
Lessor with a certified copy of the related lease documentation as promptly as
possible after the execution thereof, but prior to the commencement thereof.
Lessee may remove the rental figures therefrom and Lessor shall maintain the
confidentiality thereof. No wet lease or sublease of this Aircraft shall
extend for more than eight months, including renewals, unless the agreement
permits substitution of aircraft. Any wet lease or sublease shall be expressly
subordinate to this Lease. No sublease or wet lease shall permit a further
wet lease or sublease. Except as provided in this Section 6.2 and in Section
6.1, Lessee will not sublease or otherwise in any manner deliver, transfer or
relinquish possession of the Aircraft, the Airframe or any Engine, or assign
any of its rights or obligations hereunder and any such purported assignment
shall be void ab initio.
              -- ------ 

       63. Use; Net Lease. Lessee shall use the Aircraft solely in commercial
           --------------                                                    
operations for which Lessee is duly authorized. Lessee shall not use, or permit
the use of, any Item or Items of Equipment for any purpose for which it is not
designed. Lessee shall comply with all regulations of the FAA with respect to
the Aircraft. Lessee shall pay for and provide all electric power, oil, fuel and
lubricant consumed by and required for the operation of the Aircraft. Lessee
shall promptly pay all navigation charges (including landing fees, departure
fees and airport taxes) the nonpayment of which could result in a Lien upon the
Aircraft.

       6.4. Lawful Insured Operations. Lessee will not cause or permit any Item
            -------------------------                                          
of Equipment to be maintained, used or operated in violation of any law, treaty,
statute, rule, regulation or order of any government or governmental authority
having jurisdiction or, in the case of the Aircraft and the Engines, in
violation of any airworthiness certificate or registration relating thereto,
except to the extent any of the foregoing is being contested by Lessee in good
faith and by appropriate proceedings. Lessee agrees not to operate the Aircraft,
or suffer the same to be operated, (a) unless the Aircraft is covered by
insurance or governmental indemnity as required by the provisions of Section 12
hereof, or (b) contrary to the terms of the insurance required by the provisions
of Section 12 hereof. If the Aircraft is brought into any location or country in
which the insurance or indemnity required by Section 12 is not in full force and
effect, Lessee, in addition to its liability under

                                       18
<PAGE>
 
Sections 17 and 18, shall be liable to Lessor for loss or damage to the Aircraft
up to the Insured Value.

      6.5. Registration. Lessee will maintain the registration of the Aircraft
           ------------                                                       
with the FAA in the name of Lessor as owner throughout the Term.

      6.6. Maintenance. Lessee, at its own cost and expense, shall:
           -----------                                             

           (a) Service, repair, maintain, overhaul replace (but only in
accordance with Section 9 hereof) and test, or cause the same to be done to,
each Item leased hereunder (i) so as to keep such Item in good operating
condition, (ii) so as to keep the Aircraft in the condition necessary to
enable the airworthiness certification of such Aircraft to be maintained in
good standing at all times under all applicable laws and regulations, and
(iii) in compliance with Lessee's FAA-approved MD-11 maintenance program (the
"Maintenance Program");

           (b) Maintain all records, logs and other materials required by the 
FAA in respect of the Aircraft and all records required by the FAA to establish
traceability of all life-limited parts of the Airframe, the FAK, all Parts and
the Engines. All principal records, logs and other materials shall be maintained
by Lessee in the English language;

           (c) Promptly furnish to Lessor such information as is known by 
Lessee to be required, or as Lessor may request to enable Lessor to file any
reports required to be filed by Lessor with any governmental authority
concerning the Aircraft;

           (d) Incorporate into the Aircraft all alert Service Bulletins issued
by any Manufacturer or Supplier and all other Service Bulletins that relate to
safety and reliability of the Aircraft which are incorporated into any other
MD-11 aircraft owned or operated by Lessee. It is the agreement of the parties
that Lessee shall not discriminate against this Aircraft with respect to any
maintenance matter;

           (e) Carry out on the Aircraft all Airworthiness Directives ("AD")
imposed by the FAA which are applicable to the Aircraft and which are due during
the Term. The cost of performing the terminating action required by an AD shall
be shared between Lessor and Lessee as follows: Lessee shall pay the first
$75,000 of such terminating action and an additional amount equal to the cost of
such terminating action multiplied by a fraction the numerator of which is the
number of months from the commencement of the terminating action to the end of
the Term (assuming neither party exercises any rights under Section 8 below) and
the denominator of which is 120. Lessor shall pay any cost of the AD terminating
action in excess of the amounts paid by Lessee under the preceding sentence; and

                                       19
<PAGE>
 
           (f) Cause all modifications, repairs, maintenance and overhauls of
the Airframe, the Engines and all Parts, whether scheduled or unscheduled, to
be accomplished at FAA licensed repair stations or by an FAA-certified
mechanic. All scheduled maintenance and overhauls of the Airframe, Engines and
Parts throughout the Term shall be performed at FAA-certificated repair
stations specified in the Maintenance Program (the "Authorized Maintenance
Performer").

      6.7. Insignia and Notices. Lessee shall affix and maintain in the cockpit
           --------------------                                                
of the Aircraft adjacent to and not less prominent than the airworthiness
certificate therein and on each Engine a nameplate satisfactory to Lessor
bearing the inscription "This *[Aircraft]* *[Engine]* is owned by Wilmington
Trust Company, as Owner Trustee, subject to a Mortgage in favor of GATX
Capital Corporation as Security Agent, and leased to World Airways, Inc.," or
such other inscription as Lessor from time to time may reasonably request in
order to show its interest in the Aircraft or to show the interests of third
parties holding a mortgage or security interest in the Aircraft. Except as
otherwise provided, Lessee will not allow the name of any person or entity to
be placed on the Airframe or any Engine as a designation that might be
interpreted as a claim of ownership except that Lessee or a Permitted
Sublessee may place its customary colors and insignia on the Airframe and any
Engine.

      6.8. Maintenance Reserves. On or before the tenth (lOth) day of each
           --------------------                                           
calendar month during the Term, Lessee shall (a) report to Lessor the number of
Flight Hours accumulated during the preceding month on the Airframe and each
Engine, and (b) pay Lessor as Supplemental Rent an amount equal to the sum of
(i) Two Hundred Dollars ($200) for each flight Hour accumulated on the Airframe
(the "Airframe Reserve") plus (ii) Seventy-Three Dollars ($73) (the "Engine Base
Rate") for each Flight Hour Accumulated on each Engine (the "Engine Reserves,"
and, together with the Airframe Reserve, the "Maintenance Reserves"). The amount
of the Airframe Reserve payment shall be increased every six months by the
increase in the Consumer Price Index (CPI) for urban areas over the preceding
six months. The Engine Base Rate shall be escalated and adjusted in accordance
with the engine maintenance cost guaranties of UTC.

      The Airframe Reserve shall be allocated to separate accounts as follows:
"C" Checks, Significant Structural Items ("SSI") and Zonal Inspections, $100 per
flight Hour (the "C Check Reserve"); APU, $40 per Flight Hour (the "APU
Reserve"); Landing Gear, $20 per flight Hour (the "Landing Gear Reserve");
Thrust Reversers, $40 per flight Hour (the "Thrust Reverser Reserve"). The
Reserves for the three Engines shall be pooled in a single account.

      The Maintenance Reserves shall remain under the sole control and direction
of Lessor and shall be used to reimburse Lessee, within 10 days following
receipt of an invoice and proper documentation from Lessee for the actual cost
of:

                                       20
<PAGE>
 
           (i) Scheduled "C" Checks (including lesser checks performed in
      conjunction with the "C" Checks), Zonal Inspections and Significant
      Structural Items, up to the amount in the "C" Check Reserve, and APU heavy
      maintenance, Landing Gear overhaul replacement and overhaul and
      replacement of Thrust Reversers, up to the amount then remaining in each
      of such respective Reserves. The parties acknowledge and agree that no
      portion of the Airframe Reserve shall be used to reimburse Lessee for any
      other causes, including, without limitation, repairs covered and
      reimbursed by the Manufacturer's or other warranty, or repairs as a
      result of any accident, neglect or misuse, or required as a result of
      any Airworthiness Directives, Service Bulletins or any faulty
      maintenance or installation; and

           (ii) Engine shop visits (heavy maintenance visits) requiring teardown
      or disassembly of an Engine, up to the amount then remaining in the Engine
      Reserve. The parties acknowledge and agree that the Engine Reserves shall
      not be used to reimburse Lessee for any other engine shop visits for, or
      work performed on, an Engine, including without, limitation repairs
      required as a result of faulty maintenance or installation, misuse,
      neglect, foreign object damage, or other accidental cause (other than
      ingestion of Parts) or as a result of any Airworthiness Directives. The
      Engine Reserve shall not be used to reimburse Lessee or any other party
      for work covered and reimbursed by the Manufacturer's warranty or service
      life policy.

      If at any time the balance of the funds held in any of the specified
Airframe Reserves are insufficient to meet a claim for reimbursement from such
specified Reserve, Lessor shall provide an aggregate credit of up to $223,000
for the Airframe Reserves (less the cost of the 1/2 "C" Check performed prior to
the Delivery Date). If at any time the amount in a particular Reserve plus the
amount of the credit, if any, available from Lessor is insufficient to meet a
claim for reimbursement then the shortfall shall be the sole responsibility of
Lessee and shall not be carried forward or made the subject of any further claim
for reimbursement. All invoices subject to reimbursement from the Maintenance
Reserves shall be reduced by the actual amounts of any applicable warranty,
guaranty or concession of any Manufacturer or Supplier. Each invoice shall be
accompanied by substantiating data from the party performing the work or if such
work was performed by Lessee, a certified statement of completion together with
completed work cards or other documents reasonably requested by Lessor and a
statement from Lessee that the amount of the invoice is appropriate. Any
overhaul work performed by Lessee shall be billed at Lessee's actual cost,
without provision for overhead or profit.

                                       21
<PAGE>
 
      Lessor shall maintain the Maintenance Reserves paid by Lessee in an
interest-bearing account at a bank selected by Lessor and any interest earned in
such account on such funds shall be credited pro rata to the Airframe and Engine
Reserves. Lessor shall consult with Lessee regarding investment decisions for
such account but the control of such account shall remain with Lessor. Lessor
shall have no duty to determine whether any Item requires overhaul or
maintenance, or to observe or inspect the overhaul or maintenance of any Item,
and Lessor shall not incur any liability or obligation by reason of the failure
of the Aircraft to be properly overhauled or maintained or by reason of Lessor's
election to observe or inspect or not to observe or inspect any overhaul or
maintenance. Prior to the start of a repair of an Engine (after disassembly)
Lessee shall send Lessor an estimate of total repair costs including test cell
run and consumable liquids.

      At the end of the Term irrespective of the reason for the termination of
the Lease, including the destruction of the Aircraft, the balance, if any, of
the Maintenance Reserves shall be retained by Lessor. If Lessee receives a
credit from UTC (the "UTC Credit") at the end of any annual adjustment period
under World's UTC engine maintenance cost guarantee plan (the "UTC Guarantee")
during which the Lease was in effect then within 15 days Lessee shall pay Lessor
in cash an amount equal to the UTC Credit multiplied by 1.333 multiplied by a
fraction the numerator of which is the total Flight Hours accumulated on the
Engines during such annual period during the Lease Term and the denominator of
which is the total Flight Hours on all Lessee's engines (including the Engines)
during such annual period. Lessee shall supply Lessor with all documentation
relating to the UTC Credit applicable during the Term.

      6.9. CRAF. Notwithstanding anything in this Lease to the contrary, any
           ----                                                             
compliance by Lessee with the requirements of the Civil Reserve Airfleet
Program, or any substitute or similar program shall not, in and of itself,
result in a Default or Event of Default, provided that promptly after any such
requirement terminates Lessee complies with all of its obligations under this
Lease.

      6.10. Engines. Lessee will be entitled to temporarily remove any of the
            -------                                                          
Engines from the Aircraft and install another engine or engines on the Aircraft,
provided that the replacement engine is a Pratt and Whitney 4000 series engine
suitable for use on the Airframe and any other applicable requirements of this
Lease are satisfied.

                                   Inspection
                                   ----------

      Lessee shall furnish to Lessor such information concerning the location,
condition, use and operation of the Engines, the Aircraft or any Part thereof as
Lessor may reasonably request. Lessee shall permit any person or entity
designated in writing by Lessor to visit and inspect (at any reasonable time
upon reasonable notice) the Engines, the Aircraft or any part thereof, their
condition and the records maintained in connection therewith, including the
Maintenance Program, which shall not be copied and shall be maintained as
confidential. Lessor shall have no duty to make any such inspection and shall
not incur any liability or obligation by reason of not making any such
inspection. Lessor agrees that such requests will be coordinated with Lessee so
as to cause no disturbance to Lessee's operation

                                       22
<PAGE>
 
and no material disturbance to its personnel and so as not to increase the
down time of the Aircraft. Lessor agrees that no more than 3 inspectors will
be inspecting the Aircraft at any one time and no more than 3 inspectors will
be at Lessee's premises inspecting the Aircraft documentation at any one time.



                                   Section 8
                        Early Termination and Extension
                        -------------------------------

      8.1. Early Termination. On not less than eight months prior written
           -----------------                                             
notice, Lessor may terminate this Lease as of any Basic Rent Payment Date and
Lessee shall redeliver the Aircraft and Aircraft Records to Lessor in compliance
with Section 15 hereof.

      8.2. Extension. Unless Lessor notifies Lessee that the Aircraft is to be
           ---------                                                          
returned, Lessee may on as many occasions as Lessee may elect, eight months
prior to the then-scheduled expiration of the Term, elect to extend the Term for
an additional month. All terms and conditions of this Lease shall continue
during such extension(s).

                                   Section 9

       Replacement and Pooling of Parts; Alterations, Modifications, Etc.
       ----------------------------------------------------------------- 

      9.1. Replacement of Parts. Lessee, at its own cost and expense, shall
           --------------------                                            
promptly replace all Parts which may from time to time become worn out, lost,
stolen, destroyed, seized, confiscated, damaged beyond repair or permanently
rendered unfit for use for any reason whatsoever. In addition, in the ordinary
course of maintenance, service, repair, overhaul, modification or testing,
Lessee may remove any Part, whether or not worn out, lost, stolen destroyed,
seized, confiscated, damaged beyond repair or permanently rendered unfit for
use; provided that Lessee shall promptly replace such Part. All replacement
Parts shall be free and clear of all Liens, other than Permitted Liens, and
shall be in as good operating condition as, and shall have a value and utility
at least equal to, the Parts replaced, assuming such replaced Parts were in the
condition and repair required to be maintained by the terms hereof.

      9.2. Title to Replaced and Replacement Parts. All Parts removed from the
           ---------------------------------------                            
Airframe and the Engines shall remain the property of Lessor and subject to this
Lease, no matter where located, until such time as such Parts shall be replaced
by Parts which have been incorporated or installed in or attached to the
Airframe or an Engine and which meet the requirements for replacement Parts
specified above. Immediately upon any replacement Part becoming incorporated,
installed or attached as above provided, without further act, (a) title to the
replaced Part shall thereupon vest in Lessee, free and clear of all rights of
Lessor and its assigns; (b) such replaced Part shall no longer be deemed a
Part hereunder; (c) title to the replacement Part shall thereupon vest in
Lessor; and (d) such replacement

                                       23
<PAGE>
 
Part shall become subject to this Lease and be deemed to be a Part hereunder
to the same extent as the Parts originally incorporated or installed in or
attached to the Airframe and the Engines.

      9.3. Pooling. Any Part removed from the Airframe or any Engine as provided
           -------                                                              
in Section 9.1 may be subjected by Lessee to a normal pooling arrangement
customary in the airline industry entered into in the ordinary course of
Lessee's business with another air carrier; provided that a part replacing such
removed Part shall be incorporated or installed in or attached to such Airframe
or Engine in accordance with Section 9.1 as promptly as possible after the
removal of such removed Part.

      Any replacement Part when incorporated or installed in or attached to the
Airframe or an Engine in accordance with Section 9.1 hereof may be owned by
another air carrier, subject to a normal pooling arrangement; provided that
Lessee, at its expense, as promptly thereafter as possible either (a) causes
title to such replacement Part to vest in Lessor in accordance with Section 9.2
by Lessee acquiring title thereto for the benefit of Lessor, free and clear of
all Liens, other than Permitted Liens, or (b) replaces such replacement Part by
incorporating or installing in or attaching to the Airframe or an Engine a
further replacement Part owned by Lessee free and clear of all Liens, other than
Permitted Liens.

      9.4. Alterations, Modifications and Additions. Except as provided in this
           ----------------------------------------                            
Section 9 and in Section 6.6 hereof, Lessee shall not make any alteration,
modification or addition to the Airframe or any of the Engines. Lessee, at its
own expense, provided no Event of Default is continuing, may from time to time
make such alterations and modifications in and additions to each Item of
Equipment as Lessee may deem desirable in the proper conduct of its business,
provided that no such alteration, modification or addition adversely alters the
structure of the Aircraft or in any way diminishes the value, utility or useful
life of such Item of Equipment or impairs the condition of airworthiness thereof
below the value, utility, useful life, condition and airworthiness thereof below
the value, utility, useful life, condition nd airworthiness thereof immediately
prior to such alteration, modification or addition, assuming such Item of
Equipment was then of the value, utility and useful life and in the condition
and airworthiness required to be maintained by the terms of this Lease.


      9.5. Title to Parts. Subject to the provisions hereof, title to all Parts
           --------------                                                      
incorporated or installed in or attached or added to each Item as the result
of any alteration, modification or addition shall, without further act, vest
in the Lessor and become subject to this Lease; provided, however, that so
                                                -----------------
long as no Event of Default shall have occurred and be continuing, at any time
during the Term, the Lessee may remove any Part from an Item of Equipment,
provided that (a) such Part is in addition to, and not in replacement of or in
substitution for, any Part originally incorporated or installed in or attached
to such Item at the time of delivery thereof hereunder or any Part in
replacement of, or substitution for, any such original Part; (b) such Part is
not required to be incorporated or installed in or attached or added to such
Item pursuant to the terms hereof; and (c) such Part can be

                                       24
<PAGE>
 
removed from such Item without diminishing or impairing the value, utility or
airworthiness which such Item would have had at such time had such alteration,
modification or addition not occurred. Upon the removal by Lessee of any such
Part as above provided, title thereto shall, without further act, vest in
Lessee and such Part shall no longer be deemed a Part hereunder. Any Part not
removed by Lessee as above provided prior to the return of the respective Item
to Lessor hereunder shall remain the property of Lessor and subject to this
Lease.

      9.6. Engine Interchange. Provided no Event of Default exists and is
           ------------------                                            
continuing, Lessee may subject the Engines to normal interchange agreements
(copies of which shall have been provided to Lessor) with any Permitted
Sublessee or may subject any Engine to normal pooling or similar arrangements,
in each case customary in the airline industry and entered into by Lessee in the
ordinary course of its business; provided, however, that no such agreement or
arrangement shall contemplate or require the transfer of title to any Engine.

      10.1. General. Lessee shall pay, assume liability for and indemnify,
            -------                                                       
protect, defend, save and hold Lessor, WTC, Beneficiary, any permitted
successor, assignee or transferee of Lessor and any affiliate of any of the
foregoing with which such entity files a consolidated or combined return (each
a "Tax Indemnitee"), harmless from and against all taxes (including value-
added taxes), fees (including license and registration fees), levies, imposts,
duties, charges or withholdings of any nature whatsoever, together with any
penalties, fines or interest thereon (all the foregoing being collectively
called "Taxes") which are imposed by any government (or any political
subdivision or fiscal or taxing authority thereof) and are imposed on or with
respect to, or are measured by, (a) this Lease, (b) the Aircraft or any part
thereof, (c) the purchase, acceptance, rejection, ownership, delivery,
possession, use, presence, storage, registration, deregistration,
modification, maintenance, operation, sale, return, leasing or other
disposition thereof, or, (d) the receipts, earnings or other amounts arising
from the Aircraft, any Part or this Lease; provided, however, the foregoing
indemnity shall not apply to (i) Taxes imposed on or measured by the net
income, capital adequacy, capital stock or capital gains of a Tax Indemnitee
or that are minimum or alternative minimum Taxes or doing business Taxes
imposed on or against a Tax Indemnitee, unless such Tax resulted solely from
the operation by Lessee of the Aircraft in such jurisdiction; (ii) Taxes
imposed with respect to the period prior to the Delivery Date or after full
and final compliance by Lessee with all terms of this Lease, (iii) Taxes
imposed as a result of a sale, transfer of title, mortgaging, pledging,
financing or transfer or other disposition by any Tax Indemnitee of the
Aircraft or part thereof or interest therein or any interest in or obligation
under this Lease or in any Tax Indemnitee unless such disposition occurs by
reason of the exercise of the Lessor's remedies under this Lease upon an Event

                                       25

of Default, or (iv) Taxes which any Tax Indemnitee is subject to as a result
of business or transactions unrelated to the transactions contemplated by this
Lease or that result from the Tax Indemnitee or any affiliate being
incorporated or maintaining an office or place of business in the jurisdiction
imposing the Tax (except to the extent such Tax is increased by reason of
Lessee's activities in such jurisdiction); (v) Taxes that are a result of (a)
the gross negligence or willful misconduct of any Tax Indemnitee or the breach
of any of the covenants of or the inaccuracy at the time made of any of the
representations or warranties of any Tax Indemnitee in this Lease or any
related document, (b) the failure of any Tax Indemnitee to file any return
properly and timely or to comply with any certification, information,
documentation, reporting or other similar requirement or (c) any Lessor Lien,
(vi) Taxes imposed under (A) Section 4975 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986
as amended (the "Code") or under Part 4 or Part 5 of Subtitle B of the
Employment Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 as amended or (B) Sections
59A, 3406 or 4701 of the Code or (C) any analogous provisions of any successor
legislation.

      10.2. Withholding Taxes. Except in the case of a Tax described in Section
            -----------------                                                  
10.1 (i) through (vi), if Lessee is required by law to make any withholding
from Rent any other amount payable by Lessee to Lessor (or any other Tax
Indemnitee) under this Lease, Lessee shall pay to such Tax Indemnitee such
additional amount as may be necessary to enable such Tax Indemnitee to receive
(after such withholding) an amount equal to the full amount then payable to
such Tax Indemnitee absent such withholding. As soon as practicable after
Lessee makes any withholding from any amount payable to a Tax Indemnitee under
this Lease, Lessee shall deliver to such Tax Indemnitee a receipt or other
document, reasonably satisfactory to such Tax Indemnitee and reasonably
obtainable by Lessee, evidencing such withholding and the payment of the
amount withheld to the relevant governmental authority, for the purpose of
enabling such Tax Indemnitee to substantiate a claim for credit or deduction
for income tax purposes of the amounts so withheld. Notwithstanding anything
to the contrary in this Lease, Lessee shall have no obligation to indemnify
for any Taxes (including withholding Taxes) imposed on or with respect to or
attributable to (i) the Senior Mortgage and/or the Subordinated Mortgage (or
any payments with respect to such Mortgages) or (ii) any Lessor Lien or Debt
incurred by a Tax Indemnitee that is secured by the Aircraft or any Part
thereof.

      10.3. Amount of Indemnity. Each indemnity provided for in this Section 10
            -------------------                                                
shall be in an amount which, after taking into account all taxes, fees or other
charges imposed with respect thereto or as a result of the receipt thereof by
any jurisdiction (whether or not excepted above), and after taking into account
any deductions or tax savings (whether by credit, deduction or otherwise)
actually realized by such Tax Indemnitee as a result of the payment of such
amount or the event or circumstance which gave rise to the payment shall be
equal to the amount of such indemnity otherwise payable hereunder. Any payment
required to be made by Lessee under this Section 10 shall be due and payable
within 30 days following Lessee's receipt of a Tax Indemnitee's written demand
therefore

                                       26
<PAGE>
 
(accompanied by a written statement of such Tax Indemnitee describing in
reasonable detail the Taxes for which such Tax Indemnitee is demanding an
indemnity and the computation of the amount of the indemnity being demanded),
subject to the provisions of Section 10.4. If any Tax Indemnitee or any of its
affiliates actually realizes a net tax benefit, savings, deduction or credit
as a result of any payment by Lessee pursuant to this Section 10, not
Previously taken into account in computing such payment, the applicable Tax
Indemnitee shall promptly pay to Lessee an amount equal to the sum of (i) the
actual net reduction in Taxes, if any, realized by such Tax Indemnitee and its
affiliates which is attributable to such net tax benefit, savings, deductions
or credits and (ii) the actual net reduction in any Taxes realized by Tax
Indemnitee and its affiliates as the result of any payment made by such Tax
Indemnitee pursuant to this sentence.

      10.4. Contest. If a claim is made against a Tax Indemnitee for any Tax
            -------                                                         
that is subject to indemnification under this Section 10, such Tax Indemnitee
will promptly, and in any event within 30 days after such Tax Indemnitee is
aware of such claim, give Lessee written notice of such claim. If Lessee so
requests in writing within 30 days after receipt of such notice, (x) such Tax
Indemnitee shall permit Lessee to contest the claim in the name of such Tax
Indemnity or in the name of Lessee, to the extent permitted by law, or (y) if
such claim together with other claims which could be made with respect to
other transactions to which such Tax Indemnitee is then a party would (if
sustained) have a material adverse effect on such Tax Indemnitee's business or
financial affairs (a "Special Claim"), or (z) if Lessee shall not be permitted
by law to contest such claim on behalf of such Tax Indemnitee, such Tax
Indemnitee shall contest such claim in good faith, provided in each case only
if: (a) such Tax Indemnitee shall have received an indemnity reasonably
satisfactory to it for all expenses reasonably expected to be paid in
contesting the claim (including attorneys' and accountants' fees and
disbursements); (b) the action to be taken will not involve any material risk
of the sale, forfeiture or loss of, or the creation of any Lien on (except a
Permitted Lien or a Lien which Lessee shall have bonded in an amount and
manner reasonably satisfactory to such Tax Indemnitee), the Aircraft or any
Part thereof or any interest therein; (c) if such contest shall be conducted
in a manner requiring the payment of the claim, Lessee shall have advanced the
amount required on an after-tax basis; (d) no Event of Default shall have
occurred and be continuing and Lessor, or such other Tax Indemnity as may be
appropriate, shall be receiving all amounts of Rent when payable, without
reduction by reason of such Tax; and (e) if such claim is a Special Claim,
such Tax Indemnitee shall have received a legal opinion (at the expense of
Lessee) from counsel reasonably satisfactory to such Tax Indemnity indicating
that a reasonable basis for such contest exists. Such Tax Indemnity and Lessee
shall in good faith consider the other party's views regarding the conduct of
the contest. Such Tax Indemnitee and Lessee shall provide to each other, upon
request, such reasonably obtainable information and such other reasonable
assistance as may be necessary or advisable for the effective evaluation or
conduct of such contest. Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of this
Section 10.4, if at any time Lessor waives its right of indemnification under
this Section 10 in respect of a claim, or if, after having received payment of
indemnification from Lessee hereunder in

                                       27
<PAGE>
 
respect to such claim, Lessor tenders such payment to Lessee, then Lessee
shall not be entitled to contest, or to continue to contest, any such claim.
If any Tax Indemnitee or any of its affiliates shall receive a refund of, or
receive a credit for (or would have received such a refund or credit but for a
counterclaim or other claim not indemnified by Lessee hereunder (a "deemed
refund or credit")) all or any part of any Taxes paid, reimbursed or advanced
by or on behalf of Lessee pursuant to this Lease (including Sections 10.1,
10.2 or this 10.4), the applicable Tax Indemnitee shall pay to Lessee within
10 days of such receipt (or, in the case of a deemed refund or credit, within
10 days of the resolution of such contest), an amount equal to such refund or
credit or deemed refund or credit (along with interest on such amounts
actually received from the applicable taxing authority fairly attributable to
such amounts).

      10.5. Tax Returns. Lessee will provide such information as may be
            -----------                                                
reasonably requested by Lessor and reasonably obtainable by Lessee to enable
Lessor to fulfill its tax filing requirements with respect to the transactions
contemplated hereby. In the event that any return, statement or report is
required to be made or filed with respect to any Tax indemnified against by
Lessee under this Section 10, Lessee shall notify Lessor of such requirement and
(a) to the extent permitted by law and requested by Lessor or required by law,
make and file in its own name such return, statement or report in such manner as
will show the ownership of the Aircraft in Lessor and furnish Lessor with a copy
of such return, statement or report or (b) where such return, statement or
report is required to be in the name of or filed by Lessor, prepare and furnish
such return, statement or report for filing by Lessor in such manner as shall be
satisfactory to Lessor and send the same to Lessor for filing no later than 30
days prior to the due date. Where Lessor is required to make or file a return
statement or report reflecting items other than or in addition to Taxes
indemnified against by Lessee under this Section 10, Lessee shall, upon
Lessor's request, provide Lessor with information within a reasonable time,
sufficient to permit such return, statement or report to be properly made and
timely filed.

      10.6. Mutual Assistance. Lessor, each Tax Indemnitee and Lessee agree to
            -----------------                                                 
consider in good faith any reasonable modifications of the transaction
described in this Lease that would reduce or eliminate any Tax imposed on
either party as a result of such transaction and each such person shall
cooperate in good faith in providing information on forms or otherwise so as
to reduce or eliminate any Taxes subject to indemnification under this Lease.
Without limiting the foregoing, Lessor and Lessee shall cooperate (without any
expense to Lessor) as to the location of the Aircraft at the commencement of
this Lease in order to minimize or eliminate any sales or use Tax that might
otherwise be payable in respect of the transactions contemplated hereby.

                                       28

                                 Events of Loss
                                 --------------

      11.1. With Respect to the Aircraft. Upon the occurrence of an Event of
            ----------------------------                                    
Loss with respect to the Aircraft, Lessee shall forthwith (and in any event
within 10 days after such occurrence) give Lessor written notice of such Event
of Loss, and Lessor and Lessee shall proceed diligently and cooperate fully with
each other in the recovery of any and all proceeds of insurance applicable
thereto. Rent shall continue to accrue and be paid hereunder until such time
as Lessor has received the full amount due under this Section 11. On the
earlier of the receipt of payment from the insurers or 90 days following the
date of occurrence of such Event of Loss, Lessee shall pay to Lessor, in
immediately available funds, the Insured Value for the Aircraft.

      At such time as Lessor has received the entire amount set forth above,
together with all accrued and unpaid Rent and any other amounts due Lessor
hereunder, Lessor shall transfer to Lessee all of Lessor's right, title, and
interest, "as-is", "where-is," without recourse or warranty, express or implied,
in and to (a) the Aircraft, (b) all claims for damage to the Aircraft, if any,
against third persons arising from the Event of Loss (unless any insurance
carrier requires that such claims be assigned to it), and (c) all rights to any
insurance claims and proceeds under all insurance, except liability insurance,
maintained by Lessee hereunder, all without representation, recourse or warranty
of any kind whatsoever, except that Lessor shall warrant that it has title to
the Aircraft free and clear of Lessor Liens and Liens existing prior to the
Delivery Date. Lessee shall be entitled to receive all insurance proceeds
applicable to the Aircraft over and above the amount due Lessor under the
Preceding sentence, if any, as compensation for the loss of Lessee's leasehold
interest in the Aircraft.

      11.2. With Respect to an Engine. Upon the occurrence of an Event of Loss
            -------------------------                                         
with respect to an Engine under circumstances in which there has not occurred
an Event of Loss with respect to the Aircraft, Lessee shall forthwith (and in
any event within 10 days after such occurrence) give Lessor written notice
thereof and Lessee shall replace such Engine as soon as reasonably possible
(and, in any event, within 120 days following such Event of Loss) by duly
conveying to Lessor, free and clear of all Liens, except Permitted Lines,
title to another engine of the same or an improved model and suitable for
installation and use on the Airframe, which engine shall have a value and
utility at least equal to, and be in as good operating condition as, the
Engine with respect to which such Event of Loss shall have occurred, assuming
such Engine was of the value and utility and in the condition and repair as
required by the terms hereof immediately prior to the occurrence of such Event
of Loss. Such replacement engine shall be deemed an "Engine" as defined herein
for all purposes hereunder. Lessee agrees to promptly notify Lessor of any
such substitution provide Lessor with an officer's certificate demonstrating
full compliance with this Section 11.2 and Lessee agrees to take such action
and execute such documents, including a warranty bill of sale, as Lessor may
reasonably request in order that any such replacement Engine shall be duly and

                                       29
<PAGE>
 
properly titled in the name of Lessor and leased hereunder to the same extent
as any Engine replaced thereby. Lessor shall take such action and shall
execute such documents as are reasonably necessary to convey the Engine
replaced pursuant to the preceding sentence to Lessee or its designee on an as-
is, where-is basis, without recourse to or warranty by Lessor except that
Lessor shall warrant that it has title free and clear of Lessor Liens and
Liens existing prior to the Delivery Date.

       11.3. Application of Payments from Governmental Authorities. Payments
             ------------------------------------------------------         
received by Lessor or Lessee from any governmental authority or entity with
respect to an Event of Loss resulting from the condemnation, confiscation or
seizure of, or requisition of title to an Aircraft, an Airframe or any of the
Engines, shall be retained by Lessor, if received by Lessor, or promptly paid
over to Lessor, if received by Lessee, up to the Insured Value (plus any amounts
of Rent then due and owing). At such time as Lessor has received such amounts in
full, Lessor shall promptly remit the excess, if any, of such payments to
Lessee. Payments received by Lessor or Lessee from any governmental authority or
entity with respect to a requisition of use during the Term of an Aircraft, an
Airframe or any of the Engines shall be retained by or paid to Lessee, and
Lessee's obligation to make all payments of Rent shall continue undiminished.
Payments received by Lessor or Lessee with respect to periods after the end of
the Term shall be paid to (or retained by) Lessor unless an Event of Loss has
occurred and Lessor has received the amounts due under Section 11.1.

                                 Insurance
                                 ---------

      12.1. Public Liability, Bodily Injury and Property Damage Liability
            -------------------------------------------------------------     
Insurance. Lessee, at its own expense, shall maintain in effect third
- ---------
party aircraft liability insurance (which includes coverage with respect to
liabilities arising while the Items of Equipment are not in operation),
passenger legal liability insurance and property damage liability insurance,
including contractual liability and products liability insurance and war risk
liability insurance in accordance with AV52 or its equivalent, including the
buyback of all war risk perils (except nuclear) during the Term in an amount
not less than the greatest of (a) $700,000,000, (b) that amount normally
carried by national and international carriers engaged in similar business and
similarly situated to Lessee or (c) the amount normally carried by Lessee on
its other owned or leased MD-11 aircraft, for any one accident, or series of
accidents arising out of any one event, with respect to the Items of
Equipment. Any such liability insurance policy may be subject to a deductible
in an amount not to exceed $1,250 each claim in respect of passenger's
baggage, or such other amount as is standard market deductible for baggage,
and $5,000 each claim in respect of freight. All such policies shall be
maintained in effect with insurers and (subject to Section 12.3 below)
reinsurers of recognized reputation and responsibility, reasonably
satisfactory to Lessor. Any policies of insurance and reinsurance carried in
accordance with this Section 12.1 and any policies taken out in substitution
or replacement for any of such policies shall: (i) name, as

                                       30
<PAGE>
 
additional insureds, Lessor, WTC, GATX Capital Corporation and Credit Lyonnais
and their respective successors and assigns (notice of which assignment or
successor and the address of the new party and the fax and the telex numbers
of all parties having been supplied to Lessee's insurance broker)
(collectively, the "Additional Insureds"); (ii) provide that in respect of the
interests of the Additional Insureds such policies of insurance shall insure
the Additional Insureds regardless of any breach or violation of any warranty,
declarations or conditions contained in such policies by Lessee; and (iii)
provide that if such insurance is cancelled for any reason whatever, or the
same is allowed to lapse for nonpayment of premium, or if there is any adverse
change in policy terms and conditions, such cancellation, lapse or change
shall not be effective until 30 days (and with respect to war risk insurance,
such shorter period as shall be customary in the worldwide aviation insurance
market for such insurance in such area of the world) after receipt by the
Additional Insureds of written notice from such insurers of such cancellation,
lapse or change. Each liability policy shall (A) be primary without right of
contribution from any other insurance which is carried by the Additional
Insureds, (B) expressly provide that all of the provisions thereof, except the
limits of liability, shall operate in the same manner as if there were a
separate policy covering each insured, but this shall not operate in respect
of loss of or damage to the Airframe or Engines insured under the Hull All
Risks, Hull War Risks or Spares Policies issued to Lessee, (C) provide that
the insurers agree to waive any right of subrogation against any Additional
Insured but only to the extent that the Lessee has waived its right of
recovery against the Additional Insured; and (D) provide for world wide
coverage in full force and effect throughout any geographical areas (except as
are excluded from War Risk coverage) traversed by the Aircraft or Engines.
Without increasing the scope of coverage under the airline liability policies,
the insurers thereunder shall acknowledge the existence of the indemnification
provisions of this Lease.

      12.2. Insurance Against Loss or Damage to the Aircraft. Lessee, at its own
            ------------------------------------------------                    
expense, shall maintain in effect with insurers and (subject to Section 12.3
below) reinsurers of recognized reputation and financial responsibility: (a)
all-risk ground and flight aircraft hull insurance covering the Aircraft; (b)
all-risk spares coverage with respect to any Engines or Parts while removed
from the Aircraft and replaced; and (c) war risk, hijacking (air piracy),
confiscation, nationalization, expropriation, and related perils coverages.
All such insurance shall be in full force and effect throughout any
geographical areas (except as are excluded from War Risk coverage) traversed
at any time by the Aircraft, shall be payable in Dollars in the United States
and shall be in an amount of not less than the Insured Value. Any Hull War
Aggregate applicable to the Aircraft shall be not less than $300,000,000 (to
be increased upon policy renewal to at least $3 15,000,000) and, if losses
erode the Aggregate during the policy period, Lessee shall use its best
efforts to provide that the Aggregate shall be reinstated for the remainder of
the policy period. Any hull insurance carried in accordance with this Section
12.2 shall not contain a provision for deductible or self-insured amounts in
excess of $1,000,000. Each Engine, after removal pursuant to Section 6.1, if
another engine has been installed on the Airframe in lieu of such Engine,
shall be insured for not less than $7,500,000 under an aircraft spares policy
reasonably acceptable to Lessor. Any policies carried in accordance with this
Section 12.2 shall (i)

                                       31
<PAGE>
 
name the Lessor, Lessee and the Mortgagee as loss payees; (ii) be made payable
as provided in Sections 12.5 and 12.6 below; (iii) provide that if such
insurance is cancelled for any reason whatever, or the same is allowed to
lapse for nonpayment of premium, or if there is any adverse change in policy
terms and conditions, such cancellation, lapse or change shall not be
effective until 30 days (and with respect to war risk insurance, such shorter
period as shall be customary in the worldwide aviation insurance market for
such insurance in such area of the world) after receipt by the Additional
Insureds of written notice from such insurers of such cancellation, lapse or
change ; (iv) provide that in respect of the interests of the Additional
Insureds in such policies the insurance shall insure the Additional Insureds
regardless of any breach or violation of any warranties, declarations or
conditions contained in such policies by Lessee; (v) include waivers by the
insurers of any rights of subrogation or set-off, counterclaim or other
deduction whether by attachment or otherwise, in respect of any liability of
any Additional Insured but only to the extent that the Lessee has waived its
right of recovery against the Additional Insured; (vi) be primary without
right of contribution from any other insurance which is carried by any
Additional Insured as respects contingent hull/spares or hull total loss only
coverage; and (vii) provide that the Hull Risks Policy and the Hull War and
Allied Risks Policy shall each be endorsed to include a "50/50" clause in
accordance with clause AVS 103 or its equivalent.

      Lessee may obtain additional hull and liability insurance on the Aircraft,
over and above the amounts required hereunder.

      12.3. Reinsurance. The risks required to be insured against pursuant to
            -----------                                                      
Sections 12. 1 and 12.2 shall be either directly placed in the worldwide
aviation insurance market or shall be fully reinsured in the London, French,
American and/or Nordic markets (or any other market acceptable to Lessor) with
reinsurance companies or underwriters reasonably acceptable to Lessor (the
"Foreign Reinsurers"). All such reinsurance shall comply with all the terms and
conditions for insurance required by this Section 12. With respect to
reinsurance for the risks required to be insured against pursuant to Section
12.2 above, the Foreign Reinsurers shall be directly liable to the Additional
Insureds for all claims arising under such reinsurance in accordance with "cut-
through" endorsements in which the Foreign Reinsurers agree to make payment of
reinsurance proceeds directly to the Additional Insureds in accordance with
Sections 12.5 and 12.6. Payment directly to the Additional Insureds shall be
considered a complete discharge of the Foreign Reinsurers' liability to Lessee's
primary insurers (the "Local Insurers"). The Local Insurers shall agree that
upon knowledge of any loss or losses which may give rise to a claim under any
reinsurance policy, they shall promptly advise the Foreign Reinsurers thereof
and shall promptly furnish the Foreign Reinsurers with all information available
from time to time respecting any loss or losses which may be insured under such
reinsurance policies, but any failure to give such notice or furnish such
information shall not affect any Foreign Reinsurer's liability to the Additional
Insureds under any reinsurance policy provided that such Foreign Reinsurer has
received notice of such loss or losses from some other source. The Local
Insurers shall agree that the Foreign Reinsurers, at their option, shall also
have the right to appoint

                                       32
<PAGE>
 
adjusters, assessors and/or surveyors and to control any loss or losses
insured under such reinsurance policies, but failure by the Local Insurers to
abide by the foregoing agreement shall not affect any Foreign Reinsurer's
liability to the Additional Insureds under the reinsurance policy.

      12.4. Replacement Insurance. If Lessee shall fail to maintain any or all
            ---------------------                                             
of the insurance as provided in this Section 12, Lessor may at its option
provide such insurance and, in such event, Lessee shall, upon demand,
reimburse Lessor, as Supplemental Rent, for the cost thereof plus interest at
the Incentive Rate. Provided that Lessor has received not less than three
Business Days notice of Lessee's failure to maintain the required insurance,
Lessor shall give Lessee not less than one Business Day's notice prior to the
placement of substitute insurance by Lessor.

      12.5. Application of Proceeds in an Event of Loss. All payments under
            -------------------------------------------                    
hulls and spares insurance policies required to be maintained hereunder as the
result of the occurrence of an Event of Loss shall be applied as follows:

            (a) If such payments are received with respect to the Airframe (or
the Airframe and the Engines or engines installed thereon), Lessor and Lessee
shall proceed diligently and cooperate fully with each other in the recovery
of any and all proceeds of insurance applicable thereto, and so much of such
insurance proceeds as shall not exceed the sums due under Section 11.I above
shall be paid to Mortgagee. Any proceeds of insurance maintained by Lessee in
excess of the sums due under Section 11. 1 or received after full payment of
the sums due under Section 11. 1 shall be payable to Lessee.

            (b) If such payments are received with respect to an Engine under
the circumstances contemplated by Section 11.2 hereof, provided that no Event
of Default exists and is continuing, such payments shall be paid over to, or
retained by, Lessee, provided that Lessee shall have fully performed the terms
of Section 11.2 hereof with respect to the Event of Loss for which such
payments are made.

            In any event Lessor shall be entitled to receive all insurance
proceeds derived from insurance coverage paid for by Lessor.

      12.6. Application of Proceeds in the Absence of an Event of Loss. As
            ----------------------------------------------------------    
between Lessor and Lessee, the insurance payments of any property damage loss to
the Aircraft or any Engine not constituting an Event of Loss with respect
thereto will be applied as follows:

          (a) in respect of a claim for damage not exceeding $1,000,000 any
payment from the insurers and/or reinsurers shall be released directly to
Lessee, or where the work has been contracted out, to the repairers; and

                                       33
<PAGE>
 
          (b) in respect of a claim where damage exceeds $1,000,000 any payment
from the insurers and/or reinsurers shall be payable to Lessor or its
assignee(s) up to and including the amount of the Insured Value, but will be
paid over to Lessee in reimbursement for completed repairs or, where the
approved work has been contracted out, will be paid over to the repairer.

          Any amount referred to in this Section 12.6 which is payable to Lessee
shall not be paid to Lessee if at the time of such payment an Event of Default
shall have occurred and be continuing, but shall be held by Lessor as security
for the obligations of Lessee under this Lease and such amount shall be paid
to Lessee at such time as there no longer exists any Default or Event of
Default.

      12.7. Reports, etc. Lessee and Lessee's independent insurance broker shall
            ------------                                                        
advise Lessor in writing promptly of any default in the payment of any premium
and of any other act or omission on the part of Lessee which might invalidate or
render unenforceable, in whole or in part, any insurance or reinsurance on the
Aircraft. No notice from broker shall be required unless such broker has
knowledge of such act or omission. On the Delivery Date and at least 10 days
prior to the expiration or termination date of any insurance policy maintained
with respect to the Aircraft pursuant to this Section 12, Lessee shall provide
Lessor with a new certificate of insurance executed by an independent aircraft
insurance broker and the written opinion of such broker as to Lessee's continued
compliance with the provisions of this Section 12.

      12.8. Lessor's Additional Insurance. Lessor, at its option and at its sole
            -----------------------------                                       
expense, may obtain insurance with respect to the Aircraft; provided, that no
such insurance shall have the effect of making more expensive, suspending,
impairing, defeating, invalidating or rendering unenforceable or reducing, in
whole or in part, the coverage of or the proceeds payable under any insurance
required to be provided and maintained by Lessee pursuant to this Section 12.

      12.9. Lessor Not Liable For Premiums. All policies of insurance and
            ------------------------------                               
reinsurance carried hereunder shall clearly state that none of the Additional
Insureds or any assignee thereof, shall have any liability for or obligation
with respect to premiums, commissions, assessments or calls.

      12.10. Government Indemnity. Notwithstanding any other provision of this
             --------------------                                             
Lease requiring Lessee to maintain insurance, Lessor agrees to accept, in lieu
of insurance against any risk with respect to the Aircraft indemnification from
the United States Government or any agency or instrumentality thereof or Title
XIII Insurance issued by the FAA or any agency or department of the United
States Government, or any substantially similar successor or replacement program
of the United States Government, against such risk in an amount which, when
added to the amount of insurance against such risk maintained by Lessee
(including permitted self-insurance as set forth herein) with respect to the
Aircraft,

                                       34
<PAGE>
 
shall be at least equal to the amount of insurance against such risk otherwise
required by this Section 12.



                                 Section 13
                            General Indemnification
                            -----------------------

      13.1. Scope. Lessee shall hold Lessor, Beneficiary, WTC and their
            -----                                                      
successors, assigns, officers, directors, employees and agents (each an
"Indemnitee") harmless from any and all claims, demands, suits, causes of action
and all legal proceedings, whether civil or criminal, damages, losses,
liabilities (including, but not limited to, strict liability in tort),
obligations, penalties, judgments or fines and other sanctions, and any costs
and expenses in connection therewith, including reasonable legal fees and
expenses of whatever kind and nature ("Loss") which may result from or arise out
of (a) the condition, use or operation during the Term of any Item of Equipment
either in the air or on the ground, or (b) any maintenance, service, repair,
overhaul or testing of any Item during the Term, whether or not such Item is at
the time in the possession of Lessee; provided, however, that Lessee shall not
be required to indemnify any Indemnitee, (i) to the extent that a Loss is caused
by acts or events which occur prior to the Delivery Date or after full and final
compliance by Lessee with all terms of the Lease, (ii) for any Tax or a loss of
tax benefit (it being understood that Section 10 provides for Lessee's sole
liability with respect to Taxes), (iii) for a Loss which results solely from the
gross negligence or willful misconduct of any Indemnitee, (iv) to the extent an
Indemnitee suffers a Loss as a result of (A) the voluntary transfer of the
Aircraft or other voluntary disposition of the Aircraft by any Indemnitee other
than pursuant to Sections 11 or 17 of this Lease, (B) a transfer or disposition
of the Aircraft by any Indemnitee from bankruptcy or other proceedings for the
relief of debtors in which any Indemnitee is the debtor, whether voluntary or
involuntary, or (C) the breach by an Indemnitee of its covenants,
representations or warranties contained herein or in any other agreement
delivered in connection herewith.

      Nothing herein shall be deemed to constitute a guaranty of any useful life
or present or future residual value of the Aircraft.

      If an Indemnitee has actual knowledge of any claim or liability
indemnified against under this Section 13, it shall give prompt written notice
thereof to the Lessee. In case any action, suit or proceeding shall be brought
against any Indemnitee for which indemnity may be sought under this Section 13,
such Indemnitee shall notify Lessee of the commencement thereof, and Lessee may,
at its expense, participate in and, to the extent that it shall wish assume the
defense thereof, with counsel reasonably satisfactory to such Indemnity;
provided, that no Event of Default shall have occurred and be continuing 
- --------                                                                
pursuant to which the Lessor is exercising its remedies under Section 17 of this
Lease. If Lessee assumes the defense of such action, suit or proceeding, such
Indemnitee may participate in such defense at such Indemnitee's expense;
provided, however, that if in the written opinion of counsel

                                       35
<PAGE>
 
to such Indemnitee an actual or potential material conflict of interest exists
where it is advisable for such Indemnitee to be represented by separate
counsel, the reasonable fees and expenses of such separate counsel shall be
borne by the Lessee. With respect to any amount which the Lessee is requested
by an Indemnitee to pay by reason of this Section 13, the Indemnitee shall, if
requested by the Lessee and prior to any payment, submit such additional
information to the Lessee the Lessee may reasonably request properly to
substantiate the requested payment. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the failure
of any Indemnitee entitled to indemnity hereunder to notify the Lessee as
provided in this Section 13 shall not relieve the Lessee from any liability it
may have to any Indemnitee entitled to indemnify under this Section 13 except
to the extent delay in receiving notice increased the amount due from Lessee
under this Section 13.

      If Lessee has indemnified an Indemnitee for any Loss, the Lessee shall be
subrogated to any right of the Indemnitee in respect of the matter against which
such indemnity has been paid.

      13.2. Lessee's Release. Lessee hereby waives and releases any claim now or
            ----------------                                                    
hereafter existing against any Indemnitee on account of any and all claims,
demands, suits, causes of action and all legal proceedings, whether civil or
criminal, damages, losses, liabilities (including, but not limited to, strict
liability in tort), obligations, penalties, judgments or fines and other
sanctions, and any costs and expenses in connection therewith, including
reasonable legal fees and expenses of whatever kind and nature, which may result
from or arise out of injury to or death of personnel of Lessee or loss or damage
to property of Lessee or the loss of use of any property which may result from
or arise out of (a) the condition, use or operation during the Term of any Item
of Equipment, either in the air or on the ground, or (b) any maintenance,
service, repair, overhaul or testing of any Item during the Term, whether or not
such Item is at the time in the possession of Lessee, unless resulting solely
from the gross negligence or willful misconduct of such Indemnitee.

      13.3. Contest. If Lessee is not permitted to contest in its own name and
            -------                                                           
if an Indemnitee is unable to assign to Lessee whatever right such Indemnitee
may have to bring such an action, then if requested by Lessee in writing,
Lessor shall upon receipt of an opinion of Lessee's counsel stating that
reasonable grounds exist to take the action requested, in good faith contest
the validity, applicability or amount of any liability or loss which Lessor
may incur as a result of its contesting an indemnified amount (an "Indemnified
Amount") by (a) resisting payment thereof, (b) not paying the same except
under protest if protest is necessary and proper, or (c) if payment is made,
using reasonable efforts to obtain a refund in appropriate administrative or
judicial proceedings; provided, however, that Lessor need not contest the
applicability of any such Indemnified Amount, if the matter in question is of
a continuing nature and has previously been resolved pursuant to the
provisions of this Section 13.3.

                                       36
<PAGE>
 
      13.4. Repayment. If an Indemnitee shall obtain a repayment of any
            ---------                                                  
Indemnified Amount paid by Lessee, such Indemnitee shall promptly pay to Lessee
the amount of such repayment, together with the amount of any interest received
by such Indemnitee on account of such repayment.

      13.5. Payment. Subject to the provisions of Section 13.3 hereof, Lessee
            -------                                                          
shall pay directly to each party indemnified hereunder all amounts due under
this Section 13 within 30 days of the receipt of notice that such payment is
due.


                                   Section 14
                                     Liens
                                     -----

      Lessee shall not, directly or indirectly create, incur, assume or suffer
to exist any Lien on or with respect to any Item of Equipment or any interest
therein, except Permitted Liens. Lessee shall promptly, at its own expense, take
such action as may be necessary to duly discharge any such Lien not excepted
above if the same shall arise at any time with respect to any Item of Equipment.

                                   Section 15
                         Return of Aircraft and Records
                         ------------------------------

      This Section 15 shall not limit any rights or remedies of Lessor under
Section 17.

      15.1. Location: Storage. At the end of the Term (whether at the last day
            -----------------                                                 
of the Term or the earlier termination of the Lease), unless an Event of Loss
with respect to the Aircraft has occurred, Lessee shall return the Aircraft to
any airport in the continental United States designated by Lessor, or at any
other mutually agreeable location. Inspection and technical acceptance of the
Aircraft and the maintenance work documents shall take place at the maintenance
location of the Authorized Maintenance Performer or another mutually acceptable
location, but the obligations of Lessee hereunder shall continue until return of
the Aircraft to Lessor at the designated return location. Aircraft Records shall
be inspected and accepted at Lessee's headquarters except that Lessee shall pay
for shipment of such records to Lessor. The flight to the return location and
the fuel, insurance and crew required, shall be for Lessee's account.

      The Aircraft shall be returned in the same working order, condition and
appearance as when received pursuant to this Lease (reasonable wear from
normal passenger flight operations excepted), with all pilot discrepancies and
deferred maintenance items cleared (including those which are observed during
the return flight), clean by international commercial airline standards and
ready for flight with all of the Aircraft equipment, components and systems
operating within limits approved by the FAA and functioning in

                                       37
<PAGE>
 
accordance with their intended use. The Aircraft shall be free and clear of 
all Liens or other encumbrances of any kind, other than Lessor Liens and Liens
existing prior to the Delivery Date. If Lessor so requests, the Aircraft shall
be returned with the same interior as specified on drawings listed on Exhibit
I hereto, certified for commercial passenger service under FAR Part 121, fully
serviceable and in good operating condition.

      Following completion of the Final Inspection (as described in Section
15.7) and any repairs or maintenance required by this Section 15, Lessor and
Lessee shall execute (a) a Certificate of Technical Acceptance, similar in form
to the Lease Supplement, evidencing the return of the Aircraft and records to
Lessor and the condition thereof and (b) a Lease Termination Instrument, for the
purpose of removing this Lease from the FAA records.

      15.2. Replacement Items. Lessee will return the Aircraft with the Engines
            -----------------                                                  
installed thereon (except as permitted by Section 15.9 below) to Lessor with the
same equipment as at the commencement of this Lease, subject only to those
replacements, additions and modifications which may have been made and properly
documented pursuant to this Lease or as otherwise specifically approved in
writing by Lessor. Lessee shall, at least 30 days prior to the last day of the
Term, furnish Lessor with a listing of all such replacements, additions or
modifications then part of the Aircraft which were made during the Term and
shall deliver to Lessor a detailed technical report regarding the Flight Hours
and Cycles on the Airframe and each Engine and the maintenance status of each.

      15.3. Evaluation of Aircraft. Lessor may, from time to time prior to the
            ----------------------                                            
return of the Aircraft, wish to make the Aircraft and its records available for
inspection to designated representatives or technical teams of no more than four
persons evaluating the Aircraft for use after the end of the Term. Lessor agrees
to give Lessee not less than five days advance notice of such inspection and
Lessee agrees to cooperate fully with Lessor's requests in making the Aircraft
and records available to such authorized technical teams and Lessor agrees that
such requests will be reasonable and will be coordinated with Lessee so as to
cause no disturbance to Lessee's operations and minimal disturbance to its
personnel and no increase in the down time of the Aircraft.

      15.4. Certificate of Airworthiness. Lessee agrees to return the Aircraft
            ----------------------------                                      
with a valid, current Certificate of Airworthiness for commercial passenger
service issued by the FAA under FAR part 121.

      15.5. Demonstration Flight. Prior to the return of the Aircraft and as
            --------------------                                            
part of the Final Inspection referred to below, Lessee shall carry out for
Lessor or Lessor's representative a functional demonstration flight in the
Aircraft for a duration not to exceed three hours. Flight crews and fuel shall
be furnished by and at the expense of Lessee. After such functional
demonstration flight and immediately prior to the return of the Aircraft,

                                       38
<PAGE>
 
Lessee will correct any deficiencies noted by Lessor which are necessary for
the return of the Aircraft pursuant to this Section 15.

      15.6. Maintenance. Lessee agrees to furnish due evidence that all service,
            -----------                                                         
maintenance, repairs, overhauls and modifications required under this Lease have
been performed and are acceptable to the FAA.  A complete set of the documents
specified on Appendix A to the Lease Supplement shall be returned with the
Aircraft.

      15.7. Final Inspection and Specific Return Conditions. Immediately prior
            -----------------------------------------------                   
to the return of the Aircraft to Lessor, at Lessee's own expense:

          (a) Lessee shall make the Aircraft available to Lessor during the "C"
Check referred to below, for the purpose of conducting a detailed inspection in
order to verify that the condition of the Aircraft complies with the
requirements set forth in this Section 15 (such inspection being referred to
herein as the "Final Inspection"). Such Final Inspection shall take place at the
location of the Approved Maintenance Performer or other mutually acceptable
maintenance facility and Lessee shall give Lessor not less than 30 days prior
written notice of the location and commencement date of such Final Inspection.
To the extent that any portion of a Final Inspection extends beyond the last day
of the Term because of work required by this Section 15, the Term of this Lease
with respect to the Aircraft undergoing the Final Inspection shall be deemed to
have been automatically extended, and the obligation to pay Basic Rent hereunder
continued on a pro-rated daily basis until the Final Inspection and all
necessary work on the Aircraft shall have been concluded;

          (b) Lessee shall perform a full and complete "C" Check (including the
corresponding subordinate checks, SSI, and Zonal Inspections) or its equivalent
check sufficient to clear the Aircraft until the next "C" Check in accordance
with Lessee's approved Maintenance Program and shall correct any deficiencies
revealed during such inspection in accordance with the Maintenance Program. It
is the intent that the Aircraft will be redelivered with zero time since "C"
Check, excluding flight testing and the delivery flight. Lessee agrees to
perform, or cause to be performed, during such "C" Check, any other work
reasonably required by Lessor to enable the Aircraft to be placed on another
maintenance schedule and Lessor shall reimburse Lessee for the cost of such
other work required by Lessor at a rate based upon Lessee's direct out-of-pocket
cost for labor and materials without overhead, mark-up or profit factor;
provided, however, such work requested by Lessor shall not extend the Term of
this Lease;

          (c) All exterior markings and colors of Lessee shall be removed and
the exterior of the Aircraft will be painted white in accordance with Lessee's
standard practices and utilizing standard materials. The wings and flaps, if
painted, will be touched up as necessary to present a clean and smooth surface
and appearance;

                                       39
<PAGE>
 
          (d) The cockpit shall be in good appearance and its paint shall be
touched-up or repainted as necessary and placards will be replaced if necessary.
Those Items which are reasonably found by Lessor to be defective in the
Aircraft's cockpit will be replaced or repaired;

          (e) Lessee shall permanently repair impact damage to the Aircraft
(regardless of cause) that exceeds the limits specified in the Manufacturer's
Maintenance Manual in accordance with Manufacturer's Structural Repair Manual;

          (f) The Aircraft shall have been inspected for corrosion in accordance
with Manufacturer's recommendation then in effect; all mild and moderate
corrosion shall be cleaned and treated and all severe or exfoliated corrosion
shall be repaired in accordance with the Manufacturer's Structural Repair Manual
or Lessee's approved Maintenance Program;

          (g) Lessee shall have accomplished a maximum power run in accordance
with the limits shown in the Manufacturer's manuals;

          (h) A borescope inspection (and, in a case where an Engine does not
meet the on-wing operating criteria as required by the Manufacturer and if
requested by Lessor, a test cell performance run) shall be performed at Lessee's
expense with Lessor's representative entitled to be present and Lessee shall
provide evidence satisfactory to Lessor reflecting the correction of any
discrepancies from the guidelines set out by the Engine Manufacturer which may
be discovered during such inspection. All repairs required as a result of such
inspection shall be certified by the party performing such work. All repairs
shall be made in accordance with the Engine Manufacturer's manuals;

          (i) If the Engine historical and maintenance records and/or trend
monitoring data, including exhaust gas temperature ("EGT") margin, indicate a
rate of acceleration in performance deterioration of any Engine or APU which
indicates, based on Lessee's experience, that the Engine or APU will exceed
the limits specified in the Manufacturer's Maintenance Manual, Lessee shall,
prior to return, correct or cause to be corrected such conditions which are
determined to have exceeded the Engine or APU Manufacturer's maintenance
manual tolerances or are otherwise determined to be causing such performance
deterioration;

          (j) Lessee shall carry out on the Aircraft the final completion of al
deferred maintenance items, pilot log book reports and service bulletins as
required in Section 6 hereof and shall complete, on a terminating action or
repetitive inspection basis, as appropriate, all Airworthiness Directives
issued by the FAA which become effective on or before the date of return of
the Aircraft. Unless approved in writing by Lessor, Lessee shall not request a
waiver or delay in AD compliance with respect to this Aircraft;

                                       40
<PAGE>
 
          (k) All installed life-limited components on the Aircraft will have
sufficient calendar time, Flight Hours or Cycles (whichever is applicable)
remaining to operate until the next "C" Check but in no event less than 4,000
Flight Hours or 15 months (whichever is applicable);

          (1) The Aircraft's fuel tanks in the aggregate shall contain at least
the same amount of fuel as on the Delivery Date and each oil tank shall be full;
and

          (m) All time-controlled components of the Fly Away Kit shall be
returned in zero time condition, and all components of the Fly Away Kit shall be
in fully serviceable condition.

      15.8. Aircraft Manuals and Documentation. Following the Final Inspection
            ----------------------------------                                
and immediately prior to the return of the Aircraft to Lessor, Lessee shall:

          (a) Deliver to Lessor the Aircraft Records, in current, up to date
status and all logs, data, inspection, modification and overhaul records
required to be maintained with respect to the Aircraft under any applicable
rules and regulations of the FAA; and

           (b) Deliver to Lessor or Lessor's designee one complete copy of all
Aircraft manuals and documentation.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, in order to enable Lessor to prepare for
attendance at the Final Inspection of the Aircraft pursuant to Section 15.7,
Lessee shall make available to Lessor at a time reasonably in advance of the
Final Inspection, all necessary Aircraft records and such other documents
relating to the use, maintenance and operation of the Aircraft as Lessor shall
reasonably request.

      15.9. Corrections and Subsequent Corrections. To the extent that the
            --------------------------------------                        
Aircraft or any Engine fails to conform to any requirement imposed by this
Section 15, which failure does not interfere with the use of the Aircraft,
Lessor may, at its option, (i) continue the Lease in effect in the manner
provided for in Section 15.7 until such time as the Aircraft or Engine is
brought into compliance or, (ii) accept the return of the Aircraft or Engine
and thereafter have any such nonconformance corrected as soon as Lessor may
reasonably arrange, at commercial rates then charged by the person selected by
Lessor to perform such correction. Any expense incurred by Lessor for such
correction shall become Supplemental Rent payable by Lessee within 30 days
following the submission of a written statement by Lessor to Lessee,
identifying the items corrected and setting forth the expense of such
correction. Lessee's obligation to pay such Supplemental Rent shall survive
the last day of the Term or other termination of this Lease. Notwithstanding
the foregoing, if an engine other than an Engine is installed on the Airframe
on the date of redelivery, Lessor shall elect as provided in clause (ii) above
and Lessee, at its sole expense, shall as soon as

                                       41
<PAGE>
 
possible cause such engine to be replaced by an Engine in the condition
required by this Section 15.

                               Events of Default
                               -----------------

      16.1. Lessee's Defaults. The following events shall constitute Events of
            -----------------

of Supplemental Rent within five days after the due date thereof provided that
Lessor has invoiced Lessee for such Supplemental Rent; or

            (b) Lessee shall fail to procure and maintain all insurance required
by Section 12 hereof or Lessee shall operate the Aircraft at any time or in any
geographic area when the insurance required by Section 12 shall not be in effect
or shall operate the Aircraft in any area excluded from the War Risk coverage
(unless a Governmental indemnity shall then be in effect); or

            (c) Lessee shall fail to perform or observe in any material respect
any other of the covenants, conditions, or agreements to be performed or
observed by it hereunder and such failure shall continue for a period in excess
of 15 days from the date written notice is received from Lessor requiring the
same to be remedied, or if such failure can not be remedied within this time
period, failure to have taken all reasonable measures, so that it could be
remedied promptly thereafter; or

            (d) Any representation or warranty made by Lessee herein or in any
document or certificate furnished to Lessor in connection herewith or pursuant
hereto shall prove to have been incorrect in any material respect when made and,
if curable, has not been cured within 30 days of notice thereof from Lessor; or

            (e) Lessee shall consent to the appointment of a receiver, trustee
or liquidator of itself or of a substantial part of its property, or Lessee
admits in writing its inability to pay its debts generally as they become due,
or makes a general assignment for the benefit of creditors, or Lessee files a
voluntary petition in bankruptcy or a voluntary petition or an answer seeking
reorganization in a proceeding under any bankruptcy law (as now or hereafter
in effect) or an answer admitting the material allegations of a petition filed
against Lessee in any such proceeding, or Lessee by voluntary petition, answer
or consent seeks relief under the provisions of any other now existing or
future bankruptcy or other similar law providing for the reorganization or

                              Rights and Remedies
                              -------------------

      17.1. Remedies. Upon the occurrence of any Event of Default and at any
            --------                                                        
time thereafter so long as the same shall be continuing, Lessor may, at its
option, declare this Lease to be in default and at any time thereafter, so long
as Lessee shall not have remedied all outstanding Events of Default, Lessor may
exercise one or more of the following remedies with respect to any or all of the
Items of Equipment as Lessor, in its sole discretion, shall elect, to the extent
available and permitted by, and subject to compliance with any mandatory
requirements of, applicable law then in effect:

            (a) Pursuant to Section 4.4, apply all or any portion of the
Security Deposit to Lessor's damages attributable to such Event of Default or
to the costs of curing such Event of Default; provided, however, the Event of
Default shall continue until the Security Deposit is restored to its original
amount.

            (b) Proceed by appropriate court action or actions, either at law or
in equity, to enforce performance by Lessee of the applicable covenants of this
Lease and to recover damages for the breach thereof.

            (c) Terminate this Lease and demand that Lessee, and Lessee shall
upon written demand of Lessor and at Lessee's expense, forthwith return the
Aircraft to Lessor in the manner and condition required by, and otherwise in
accordance with all of the provisions of, Section 15 hereof as if the Aircraft
were being returned at the end of the Term; or Lessor may enter upon the
premises where the Aircraft is located and take

                                       44
<PAGE>
 
immediate possession of and remove the same by summary proceedings or
otherwise, all without liability for or by reason of such entry or taking of
possession whether for the restoration of damage to property caused by such
taking or otherwise.

            (d) In addition to all other legal and equitable rights of Lessor,
upon notice to Lessee, Lessor may, following an Event of Default:

                (i) lease the repossessed Aircraft or any part thereof to any
      third party upon such terms and conditions as Lessor may determine;

               (ii) sell the Aircraft, or any part thereof, to the highest
      bidder at public auction or private sale.

The total proceeds of any such leases and/or sales, less expenses of Lessor
(including attorneys' fees), to the extent actually received and retained by
Lessor, shall be applied to the total amount due to Lessor as provided herein
and Lessee shall immediately pay to Lessor any deficiency.

            (e) On the date on which Lessor shall become entitled to
repossession of the Aircraft, Lessor, in addition to all other remedies herein
provided, may by notice to Lessee, demand that Lessee pay, and Lessee shall
pay, on the first Basic Rent Payment Date following said notice, (i) any due
and unpaid Basic Rent and Supplemental Rent, together with interest at the
Incentive Rate from the due date to the date the same are paid, and (ii) as
liquidated damages for loss of a bargain and not as a penalty, an amount equal
to the difference between (a) the sum of all remaining payments of Basic Rent
falling due hereunder after the date of said notice, discounted to the date of
said notice at a rate of interest equal to the Prime Rate on a monthly basis,
and (b) the fair market rental (as determined by an independent aviation
appraiser of recognized standing, selected by Lessor) of the Aircraft for the
remaining Term, discounted at the same rate and frequency specified in (i)
above; provided, however, if Lessor has already leased the Aircraft as
permitted by Section 17.l(d)(i) above, the rental specified in such lease (if
it is on substantially the same terms and conditions as this Lease) shall be
conclusive as to the "fair market rental".

      17.2. Further Rights. Lessee shall be liable for any and all unpaid Rent
            --------------                                                    
and for all reasonable legal fees and other costs and expenses incurred by
reason of the occurrence of any Event of Default or the exercise of Lessor's
remedies with respect thereto, including all costs and expenses incurred in
connection with the return of any Item in accordance with the terms of Section
15 hereof or in placing such Item in the condition and with airworthiness
certificates as required by Section 15.

      17.3. Remedies Cumulative. Except as otherwise expressly provided in
            -------------------                                           
Section 18.1 hereof, no remedy referred to in this Section 17 is intended to
be exclusive, but each shall be cumulative and in addition to any other remedy
referred to above or otherwise

                                       45
<PAGE>
 
available to Lessor at law or in equity; and the exercise or beginning of
exercise by Lessor of any one or more of such remedies shall not preclude the
simultaneous or later exercise by Lessor of any or all of such other remedies.
No express or implied waiver by Lessor of any Event of Default shall in any
way be, or be construed to be, a waiver of any future or further Event of
Default.

                                 Miscellaneous
                                 -------------


      18.1. Severability, Amendment, Construction and Applicable Law. Any
            --------------------------------------------------------     
provision of this Lease which is prohibited or unenforceable in any jurisdiction
shall, as to such jurisdiction, be ineffective to the extent of such prohibition
or unenforceability without invalidating the remaining provisions hereof, and
any such prohibition or unenforceability in any jurisdiction shall not
invalidate or render unenforceable such provision in any other jurisdiction. No
term or provision of this Lease may be changed, waived, discharged or terminated
orally, but only by a written instrument signed by the party against which the
enforcement of the change, waiver, discharge or termination is sought. The
captions in this Lease are for convenience of reference only and shall not
define or limit any of the terms or provisions hereof. THIS LEASE SHALL IN ALL
RESPECTS BE GOVERNED BY, AND CONSTRUED IN ACCORDANCE WITH, THE LAWS OF THE STATE
OF NEW YORK, INCLUDING ALL MATTERS OF CONSTRUCTION, VALIDITY AND PERFORMANCE.

      18.2. Notices. All notices provided for herein shall be in writing and
            -------

or to such other address as any party may designate for itself by written notice
to the other party.

      18.3. Lessor's Right to Perform. If Lessee fails to perform any of its
            -------------------------                                       
obligations hereunder, Lessor may, following five days (or one Business Day in
the case of insurance) notice to Lessee, discharge such obligation, and the
amount of the expenses of Lessor incurred in connection with such discharge,
together with interest thereon at the Incentive Rate, shall be deemed
Supplemental Rent, payable by Lessee upon Lessor's demand.

      18.4. Counterparts. At least three counterparts of this Lease have been
            ------------                                                     
executed by the parties hereto, each of which shall be deemed to be an original
but all of which taken together shall constitute a single agreement. One
counterpart has been prominently marked "Lessor's Copy"; one counterpart has
been prominently marked "Lessee's Copy"; and one counterpart has been
prominently marked "FAA Copy" and shall be filed for recordation with the FAA.

      18.5. Assignment by Lessor. Lessor shall have the absolute right to
            --------------------                                         
transfer or assign to any person, firm, corporation or other entity any or all
of Lessor's rights, obligations, benefits and interests under this Lease,
including, without limitation, the right to receive Rent or any other payment
due under this Lease, the right to transfer or assign title to any Item of
Equipment or to transfer or assign the right to purchase any Item and the right
to make all waivers and agreements, to give all notices, consents and releases,
to take all action upon the occurrence of an Event of Default, or to do any and
all other things which Lessor is or may become entitled to do under this Lease.
Lessee acknowledges that, if Lessor should sell or transfer to a third party all
of Lessor's interest under this Lease and in the Aircraft, Lessor shall
thereupon be relieved of all of its obligations hereunder and Lessor's
transferee shall succeed to all of Lessor's rights, interests and obligations
under this Lease as though Lessor's transferee had been the initial lessor
hereunder; provided, however, that in the event of a transfer or assignment of a
security interest in any Item, Lessor shall remain liable hereunder. In the
event of a transfer of Lessor's entire interest in the Aircraft and the Lease,
except following an Event of Default, Lessor agrees that such transferee (a)
will be a "citizen of the United States" within the meaning of Section 101(16)
of the Federal Aviation Act, and (b) will have a net worth of at least
$50,000,000, or, if less the obligations of which under the Lease will be
fully guaranteed by an entity with such a net worth.

      18.6. Service of Process; Waiver of Immunities. Lessee (a) irrevocably
            ----------------------------------------                        
submits itself to the nonexclusive jurisdiction of the Supreme Court of the
State of New York, New York County, or the United States District Court for the
Southern District of New York, for the purpose of any suit, action or other
proceeding arising out of this Lease, or the subject matter hereof or any of the
transactions contemplated hereby or thereby, brought by Lessor or its successor,
subrogees or assigns, (b) irrevocably agrees that all claims in respect of such
action or proceeding may be heard and determined in such New York State or
United States Federal court and (c) to the extent that Lessee has or hereafter
may acquire any immunity from jurisdiction of any court or from any legal
process, waives such immunity, and agrees not to assert, by way of motion, as a
defense or otherwise, in any such suit, action or proceeding the defense of
sovereign immunity, any claim that it is not personally subject to the
jurisdiction of the above-named New York State or United States Federal courts
by reason of sovereign immunity or otherwise, that it is immune from any legal
process (whether through service or notice, attachment prior to judgment,
attachment in aid of execution, execution or otherwise) with respect to itself
or its property, or attachment either prior to judgment or on any day of
execution, by reason of sovereign immunity, that the suit, action or proceeding
is brought in an inconvenient forum, that the venue of the suit, action or
proceeding is improper, or that this Lease or the subject matter hereof may not
be enforced in or by such courts.

      The obligations of Lessee payable under this Lease in one currency (the
"first currency") may be discharged by an amount paid by Lessee pursuant to any
order or judgment of any court or other tribunal in another currency (a "second
currency"), but only to the extent that the amount so paid in a second currency
on prompt conversion to the first currency under normal banking procedures
yields the amount of the first currency due hereunder, and Lessee shall
indemnify Lessor and any other person entitled to payments hereunder against any
such shortfall. In the event that any payment in a second currency by Lessee to
any such person or entity, whether pursuant to a judgment or otherwise, upon
conversion and transfer to the designated place of payment therefore does not
result in payment of such amount of the first currency, such person or entity
shall have a separate cause of action against Lessee for the additional amount
necessary to yield the amount due and owing to such person.

      18.7. Language. The English language version of this Lease will be the
            --------                                                        
official, controlling version and any dispute over the interpretation of the
Lease, whether directly between the parties or involving the courts of the
United States or elsewhere, shall be resolved based upon the Lease as written
in the English language, any interpretation thereof into another language
being merely for convenience of understanding. All notices, reports and other
communications given under this Lease shall be in the English language.

      18.8. Costs and Expenses. Each party shall be responsible for its costs
            ------------------                                               
and expenses, including attorneys' fees, of negotiation and documentation of
this transaction. In the event of any litigation between the parties over this
Lease or the subject matter 

                                       48
<PAGE>
 
hereof, the prevailing party shall, in addition to whatever other damages,
costs and expenses are recovered, be entitled to recover its costs and
expenses of such litigation, including attorneys' fees and expenses. Lessee
shall be responsible for the cost, including attorneys' fees and expenses, of
registering this Lease in any foreign jurisdiction.

      18.9. Survival. The indemnities of Lessee set forth in this Lease shall
            --------                                                         
survive the expiration or other termination of this Lease to the extent required
for full performance and satisfaction thereof.

      18.10. Further Assurances. Each party hereto shall, at its respective
             ------------------                                            
expense, promptly and duly execute and deliver to the other party such further
documents and promptly take such further action not inconsistent with the terms
hereof as the other party may from time to time reasonably request in order to
more effectively carry out the intent and purpose of this Lease or to perfect
and protect the rights and, with respect to Lessor, remedies created or intended
to be created hereunder.

      18.11. Entire Agreement. This Lease and the Lease Supplement executed
             ----------------                                              
pursuant hereto constitute the entire agreement between Lessor and Lessee
regarding the Aircraft and there are no other prior or contemporaneous written
or oral understandings with regard to the subject matter hereof.

      18.12. Successors and Assigns. This Lease shall be binding on and shall
             ----------------------                                          
inure to the benefit of Lessee, Lessor and their respective successors and
permitted assigns.

      18.13. Concerning Lessor. WTC is entering into this Lease solely in its
             -----------------                                               
capacity as Owner Trustee under the Trust Agreement and not in its individual
capacity (except as expressly stated herein) and in no case shall WTC (or any
entity acting as successor Owner Trustee under the Trust Agreement) be
personally liable for or on account for any statement, representations,
warranties, covenants or obligations stated to be those of Lessor hereunder;
provided, however, that WTC (or any successor Owner Trustee) shall be personally
- -----------------                                                               
liable hereunder for its own willful misconduct and gross negligence and for
its covenants and representations in Sections 5.1, 5.4 and 10 (to the extent
such representation, warranty or covenant is given in its individual
capacity).

GATX Capital Corporation

San Francisco, CA 94111

Ladies and Gentlemen:

      We have acted as special counsel to World Airways, Inc., a Delaware
corporation (the "Lesee"), in connection with the execution and delivery of the
Aircraft Lease Agreement, dated as of January 15, 1993 (the "Lease"), between
Wilmington Trust Company, as Owner Trustee, and the Lessee. Capitalized terms
used in this opinion and not otherwise defined herein shall have the meanings
assigned to them in the Lease.

      In connection with this opinion, we have examined executed copies of the
Lease and such other documents as we have deemed necessary or appropriate for
the purpose of this opinion. In rendering our opinion, we have assumed the due
authorization, execution and delivery of the Lease by the parties thereto, that
the Lease constitutes the legal, valid, binding and enforceable obligation of
the Lessor, the authenticity of all documents submitted to us as originals and
the conformity to authentic original documents of all documents submitted to us
as certified, conformed or photostatic copies. In rendering this opinion we have
relied, insofar as certain factual matters are concerned, on the representations
and warranties made in or pursuant to the Lease or in certificates required to
be delivered pursuant thereto.

      Based on the foregoing, and subject to the limitations stated herein, we
are of the opinion that:

      1. The Lease is a legal, valid and binding obligation of the Lessee,
enforceable against the Lessee in accordance with its terms, except as
enforceability may be limited to bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization or other
laws of general application affecting the enforcement of creditors' rights and
by general equitable principles. Such enforceability may be limited, in the case
of indemnities, by considerations of public policy and, in the case of remedial
provisions, by applicable laws and judicial decisions, provided that in our
opinion such laws and judicial

                                  Exhibit C
                                  ---------
                          to Aircraft Lease Agreement

                                      
<PAGE>
 
decisions will not prevent the practical realization of the
benefits intended to be provided by the Agreement as a whole.

      2. The execution and delivery of the Lease and the consummation by the
Lessee of the transactions therein contemplated do not contravene any New York
law applicable to the Lessee.

      We express this opinion as members of the Bar of the State of New York and
do not purport to be experts in, or express any opinion concerning, the laws of
any jurisdiction other than the laws of the State of New York and the Federal
laws of the United States, provided that no opinion is rendered as to any laws,
rules or regulations of any jurisdiction relating to aircraft or aviation.

      This opinion is being delivered to you pursuant to Section 2.3(b)(iii) of
the Lease and is not to be relied upon by any other person without our prior
written consent.

                              Very truly yours,

                                     - 2 -

GATX Capital Corporation

San Francisco, CA 94111

Ladies and Gentlemen:

      I am the General Counsel of World Airways, Inc., a Delaware corporation
(the "Lessee"), and am delivering this opinion in connection with the execution
and delivery of the Aircraft Lease Agreement dated as of January 15, 1993 (the
"Agreement"), between you and the Lessee. Capitalized terms used in this opinion
and not otherwise defined herein shall have the meanings assigned to them in the
Agreement.

      In connection with this opinion, I have examined executed copies of Lease
and such other documents as I have deemed necessary or appropriate for the
purpose of this opinion. In rendering my opinion, I have assumed the due
authorization, execution and delivery of the Agreement by you, that the
Agreement constitutes the legal, valid, binding and enforceable obligation of
the parties thereto, the authenticity of all documents submitted to me as
originals and the conformity to authentic original documents of all documents
submitted to me as certified, conformed or photostatic copies. In rendering this
opinion I have relied, insofar as certain factual matters are concerned, on the
representations and warranties made in or pursuant to the Agreement.

      I have not considered the Federal Aviation Act of 1958, as amended (the
"Act"), or the status of title to the Aircraft.

      Based on the foregoing, and subject to the limitations stated herein, I am
of the opinion that:

      1. Lessee is a corporation duly incorporated, validly existing and in good
standing under the laws of Delaware. It has the corporate power and authority to
carry on its business as presently conducted and to perform its obligations
under the Agreement.

      2. To my knowledge, without having made any special investigation
concerning any law other than the laws specifically referred to in this opinion,
no authorization, approval, consent, license or order of, or registration with,
or the giving of notice to any regulatory body or authority is required for the
valid authorization, execution, delivery and performance by the Lessee of the
Agreement. I express no opinion, however, as to any such consent, approval,
action or filing (i) which may be required as a result of Lessor's legal or
regulatory status or because of any

                                  Exhibit C-1
                                  -----------
                          to Aircraft Lease Agreement

<PAGE>
 
other facts specifically pertaining to Lessor, (ii) the absence of which will
not have a material adverse effect on Lessor and does not deprive Lessor of any
material rights under the Agreement, or (iii) which can be readily obtained
without significant delay or expense to Lessor, without loss to Lessor or any
material adverse effect on Lessor during the period such consent, approval,
action or filing was not obtained or effected.

      3. The Agreement has been duly authorized, executed and delivered by
lessee.

      4. The execution and delivery of the Agreement, the consummation by the
Lessee of the transactions therein contemplated and compliance by the Lessee
with the terms and provisions thereof do not and will not contravene any
Virginia or United States federal law or the General Corporation Law of
Delaware, applicable to Lessee, or result in any material breach of or
constitute any material default under (i) the Certificate of Incorporation or
Bylaws of Lessee, or (ii) to the best of my knowledge, under any indenture,
mortgage, chattel mortgage, deed of trust, conditional sales contract, bank loan
or credit agreement, or other agreement or instrument to which Lessee is a party
or by which Lessee or its properties or assets may be bound or affected, or
result in the creation of any lien, charge or encumbrance upon any property of
Lessee.

      I express this opinion as a member of the Bar of the State of Virginia and
do not purport to be expert in, or express any opinion concerning, the laws of
any jurisdiction other than the laws of the State of Virginia, the General
Corporation Law of Delaware and the Federal laws of the United States to the
extent specifically referred to in this opinion.

      I assume no obligation to advise you of any changes in the foregoing
subsequent to the delivery of this opinion. This opinion has been prepared
solely for your use in connection with the Agreement and should not be quoted in
whole or in part or otherwise be referred to, nor be filed with or furnished to
any governmental agency or other person or entity without my prior written
consent.

                              Very truly yours,


                              Andrew M. Paalborg

              -------------------------------------
duly incorporated and validly existing under the laws of the state or country 
of its incorporation and is an air carrier of persons and property in air 
transportation, registered, licensed or otherwise certificated or duly 
authorized by the FAA and any other appropriate aeronautics authority to 
engage in such air transportation and is duly qualified or otherwise 
authorized to do business as an air carrier in all jurisdictions in which it 
has air routes, except for jurisdictions where failure to so qualify or obtain
authorization would not have a material adverse effect on the business of 
Lessee and would not involve any material danger of the sale, forfeiture or 
loss of any Item of Equipment or the impairment of the value thereof.

         (b)  Authority.  Lessee has full corporate power and authority to 
              ---------
enter into and perform this Lease and each Lease Supplement; and the 
execution, delivery and performance of this Lease and each Lease Supplement 
have been duly authorized by all necessary corporate action on the part of 
Lessee, do not require any stockholder approval or approval or consent of any
trustee or holders of any Debt or other obligations of Lessee except such as 
have been duly obtained and do not contravene any provision of any law, 
governmental rule, regulation or order binding on Lessee, or any applicable 
interpretation or administration of any such law, governmental rule, 
regulation or order, or contravene the certificate of incorporation, by-laws 
or other organic documents of Lessee or any indenture, mortgage, contract or

                                     10
<PAGE>
 
         (c)  Governmental Approvals.  Except for the filing of this Lease and
              ----------------------
each Lease Supplement with the FAA, neither the making nor performance by 
Lessee of this Lease or the Lease Supplements, nor the consummation of any of 
the transactions by Lessee contemplated hereby or thereby, nor the 
acquisition, ownership or leasing by Lessor of the Spare Parts under such 
documents, requires the consent or approval of, the giving of notice to, the 
registration or filing for recordation with, or the taking of any other action
in respect of, the Government or any political agency, subdivision or 
instrumentality thereof, except such as have been obtained, made or taken.

         (d)  Binding Obligations.  This Lease constitutes the valid and 
              -------------------
legally binding obligation of Lessee enforceable against Lessee in accordance 
with the terms hereof.

         (e)  Litigation.  Except as otherwise disclosed in the Lessee's most 
              ----------
recent Form 10Q and Form 10K, there are no suits or proceedings pending or, to
the knowledge of Lessee, threatened in any court or before any regulatory 
commission, board or other administrative or governmental agency against or 
affecting Lessee which relate to the transactions contemplated hereby or 
which, if adversely determined, would have a material adverse affect on the 
ability of Lessor to perform its obligations hereunder.

              -------------------
December 31, 1992 (the "1992 Balance Sheet"), and the audited statements of 
profit and loss of Lessee for 1991, each certified by KPMG Peat Marwick, 
fairly present the financial condition of Lessee and have been prepared in 
accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. Lessee has no 
contingent obligations, liabilities for taxes or unusual forward or long-term 
commitments which could have a material adverse effect on its financial 
condition, except as disclosed in the 1992 Balance Sheet. Since December 31, 
1992, there has been no material adverse change in Lessee's operations or 
financial condition from that reflected in such financial statements other 
than changes in the ordinary course of business the effect of which has not 
been materially adverse to the ability of Lessee to fulfill its obligations 
hereunder.

         (g)  Pari Passu Ranking.  The obligations of Lessee to pay Rent 
              ------------------
hereunder will be direct and unconditional general obligations of Lessee, and 
will rank in right of payment at least pari passu with all unsecured 
obligations of Lessee.

         (h)  No Conflicting Agreements.  Lessee is not a party to any 
              -------------------------
agreement or instrument or subject to any charter or other corporate 
restriction which individually or in the aggregate is, in the reasonable 
judgment of Lessee, likely to materially adversely affect its ability to 
perform its obligations under this Lease or the Lease Supplements.

         (i)  No Default.  No Default or Event of Default has occurred and is 
              ----------
continuing.

                                     11
<PAGE>
 
         (j)  Protective Filings.  Other than the filing for recordation of
              ------------------
this Lease and each Lease Supplement with the FAA, no other filing or
recording of any document and no other action is necessary or advisable in the
United States of America, in order to establish and perfect Lessor's title to
and interest in the Spare Parts as against Lessee and any third parties
claiming against or through Lessee, including trustees, custodians and other
representatives or similar officials, under any bankruptcy or liquidation law
or regulations, or other regulations, or otherwise.

documents shall obligate Lessee to agree to material covenants or restrictions
not already present in this Lease; (ii) an Officer's Certificate stating that 
each such document has been duly authorized, executed and delivered by Lessee 
and that no Event of Default exists and is continuing hereunder; and (iii) if

shall not without Lessor's prior written consent deliver, relinquish or 
transfer possession of any Item or Items of Equipment, except for the transfer
of possession and replacement of Parts as provided in Sections 9.1 and 9.3; 
provided, however, that, so long as no Event of Default shall have occurred

         -------------------------
of Equipment to be maintained, used or operated in violation of any law, 
treaty, statute, rule, regulation or order of any government or governmental 
authority having jurisdiction except to the extent any of the foregoing is 
being contested by Lessee in good faith and by appropriate proceedings. Lessee
agrees not to use any Item of Equipment, or suffer the same to be used, (a) 
unless such Item is covered by insurance or governmental indemnity as required
by the provisions of Section 12 hereof, or (b) contrary to the terms of the 
insurance required by the provisions of Section 12 hereof. If any Item is 
brought into any location or country in which the insurance or indemnity

its liability under Sections 17 and 18, shall be liable to Lessor for loss or 
damage to the Item up to its replacement cost.

Lessee shall not discriminate against any of the Items of Equipment with 
respect to any maintenance matter or modification status;

imposed by the FAA which are applicable to such Item and which are due during

          ----
compliance by Lessee with the requirements of the Civil Reserve Airfleet 
Program, or any substitute or similar program, shall not, in and of itself,

requirement terminates Lessee complies with all of its obligations under this 
Lease.

connection therewith, including the Maintenance Program, which shall not be 
copied and shall be maintained as strictly proprietary and confidential. 
Lessor shall have no duty to make any such inspection and shall not incur any 
liability or obligation by reason of not making any such inspection. Lessor 
agrees that such requests will be coordinated with Lessee so as to cause no 
disturbance to Lessee's operation and no material disturbance to its 
personnel. Lessor agrees that no more than two inspectors will be inspecting 
the Spare Parts or the Spare Parts documentation at any one location at any 
time. Lessor agrees that such inspections will be coordinated with Lessee so 
that the down time of an aircraft will not be increased.

expense, provided no Event of Default is continuing, may from time to time 
make such alterations and modifications in and additions to each Item of 
Equipment as Lessee may deem desirable in the proper conduct of its business, 
provided that no such alteration, modification or addition adversely alters 
the structure of any Item or in any way diminishes the value, utility or 
useful life of such Item of Equipment or impairs the condition thereof below 
the value, utility, useful life and condition thereof immediately prior to 
such alteration, modification or addition, assuming such Item of Equipment was
then of the value, utility and useful life and in the condition required to be
maintained by the terms of this Lease.

          --------------

in or attached or added to such Item pursuant to the terms hereof; and (c) 
such part can be removed from such Item without diminishing or impairing the 
value or utility which such Item would have had at such time had such 
alteration, modification or addition not occurred. Upon the removal by Lessee
of any such part as above provided, title thereto shall, without further 
act, vest in Lessee. Any part not removed by Lessee as above provided prior 
to the return of the respective Item to Lessor hereunder shall remain the 
property of Lessor and subject to this Lease.


                                 SECTION 10
                                    TAXES
                                    -----

     10.1.  General. Lessee shall pay, assume liability for and indemnify, 
protect, defend, save and hold Lessor, any permitted successor, assignee or 
transferee of Lessor and any affiliate of any of the foregoing with which such
entity files a consolidated or combined return (each a "Tax Indemnitee"), 
harmless from and against all taxes (including value-added taxes), fees 
(including license and registration fees), levies, imposts, duties, charges or
withholdings of any nature whatsoever, together with any penalties, fines or 
interest thereon (all the foregoing being collectively called "Taxes") which 
are imposed by any government (or any political subdivision or fiscal or 
taxing authority thereof) and are imposed on or with respect to, or are 
measured by, (a) this Lease, (b) the Spare Parts, (c) the purchase, 
acceptance, rejection, ownership, delivery, possession, use, presence, 
storage, registration, deregistration, modification, maintenance, operation, 
sale, return, leasing or other disposition thereof, or, (d) the receipts, 
earnings or other amounts arising from the Spare Parts or this Lease; 
provided, however, the foregoing indemnity shall not apply to (i) Taxes 
imposed on or measured by the net income, capital adequacy, capital stock or 
capital gains of a Tax Indemnitee or that are minimum or alternative minimum 
Taxes or doing business Taxes imposed on or against a Tax Indemnitee, unless 
such Tax resulted solely from the use by Lessee of the Spare Parts in such 
jurisdiction; (ii) Taxes imposed with respect to the period prior to the 
applicable Delivery Date or after full and final compliance by Lessee with all
terms of this Lease, (iii) Taxes imposed as a result of a sale, transfer of 
title, mortgaging, pledging, financing or transfer or other disposition by any
Tax Indemnitee of all or any portion of the Spare Parts or interest therein or
any interest in or obligation under this Lease or in any Tax Indemnitee unless
such disposition occurs by reason of the exercise of the Lessor's remedies 
under this Lease upon an Event of Default, or (iv) Taxes which any Tax 
Indemnitee is subject to as a result of business or transactions unrelated to 
the transactions contemplated by this Lease or that result from the Tax 
Indemnitee or any affiliate being incorporated or maintaining an office or 
place of business in the jurisdiction

                                     19
<PAGE>
 
imposing the Tax (except to the extent such Tax is increased by reason of 
Lessee's activities in such jurisdiction); (v) Taxes that are a result of (a) 
the gross negligence or willful misconduct of any Tax Indemnitee or the breach
of any of the covenants of or the inaccuracy at the time made of any of the 
representations or warranties of any Tax Indemnitee in this Lease or any 
related document, (b) the failure of any Tax Indemnitee to file any return 
properly and timely or to comply with any certification, information, 
documentation, reporting or other similar requirement or (c) any Lessor Lien, 
(vi) Taxes imposed under (A) Section 4975 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986
as amended (the "Code") or under Part 4 or Part 5 of Subtitle B of the
Employment Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 as amended or (B) Sections
59A, 3406 or 4701 of the Code or (C) any analogous provisions of any successor
legislation.

     10.2. Withholding Taxes. Except in the case of a Tax described in Section
           -----------------
10.1 (i) through (vi), if Lessee is required by law to make any withholding 
from Rent or any other amount payable by Lessee to Lessor (or any other Tax 
Indemnitee) under this Lease, Lessee shall pay to such Tax Indemnitee such 
additional amount as may be necessary to enable such Tax Indemnitee to receive
(after such withholding) an amount equal to the full amount then payable to 
such Tax Indemnitee absent such withholding. As soon as practicable after 
Lessee makes any withholding from any amount payable to a Tax Indemnitee under
this Lease, Lessee shall deliver to such Tax Indemnitee a receipt or other 
document, reasonably satisfactory to such Tax Indemnitee and reasonably 
obtainable by Lessee, evidencing such withholding and the payment of the 
amount withheld to the relevant governmental authority, for the purpose of 
enabling such Tax Indemnitee to substantiate a claim for credit or deduction 
for income tax purposes of the amounts so withheld. Notwithstanding anything 
to the contrary in this Lease, Lessee shall have no obligation to indemnify 
for any Taxes (including withholding Taxes) imposed on or with respect to or 
attributable to any Lien or Debt incurred by a Tax Indemnitee that is secured 
by all or any portion of the Spare Parts or any Item.

     10.3 Amount of Indemnity. Each indemnity provided for in this Section 10 
shall be in an amount which, after taking into account all taxes, fees or 
other charges imposed with respect thereto or as a result of the receipt 
thereof by any jurisdiction (whether or not excepted above), and after taking 
into account any deductions or tax savings (whether by credit, deduction or 
otherwise) actually realized by such Tax Indemnitee as a result of the payment
of such amount or the event or circumstance which gave rise to the payment 
shall be equal to the amount of such indemnity otherwise payable hereunder. 
Any payment required to be made by Lessee under this Section 10 shall be due 
and payable within 30 days following Lessee's receipt of a Tax Indemnitee's 
written demand therefore (accompanied by a written statement of such Tax 
Indemnitee describing in reasonable detail the Taxes for which such Tax 
Indemnitee is demanding an indemnity and the computation of the amount of the 
indemnity being demanded), subject to the provisions of Section 10.4. If any 
Tax Indemnitee or any of its affiliates actually realizes a net tax benefit, 
savings, deduction or credit as a result of any payment by Lessee pursuant to 
this Section 10, not

                                     20
<PAGE>
 
previously taken into account in computing such payment, the applicable Tax 
Indemnitee shall promptly pay to Lessee an amount equal to the sum of (i) the
actual net reduction in Taxes, if any, realized by such Tax Indemnitee and its
affiliates which is attributable to such net tax benefit, savings, deductions
or credits and (ii) the actual net reduction in any Taxes realized by Tax
Indemnitee and its affiliates as the result of any payment made by such Tax
Indemnitee pursuant to this sentence.

     10.4. Contest. If a claim is made against a Tax Indemnitee for any Tax 
           -------
that is subject to indemnification under this Section 10, such Tax Indemnitee
will promptly, and in any event within 30 days after such Tax Indemnitee is
aware of such claim, give Lessee written notice of such claim. If Lessee so
requests in writing within 30 days after receipt of such notice, (x) such Tax
Indemnitee shall permit Lessee to contest the claim in the name of such Tax
Indemnitee or in the name of Lessee, to the extent permitted by law, or (y) if
such claim together with other claims which could be made with respect to
other transactions to which such Tax Indemnitee is then a party would (if
sustained) have a material adverse effect on such Tax Indemnitee's business or
financial affairs (a "Special Claim"), or (z) if Lessee shall not be
permitted by law to contest such claim on behalf of such Tax Indemnitee, such
Tax Indemnitee shall contest such claim in good faith, provided in each case
only if: (a) such Tax Indemnitee shall have received an indemnity reasonably
satisfactory to it for all expenses reasonably expected to be paid in
contesting the claim (including attorneys' and accountants' fees and
disbursements); (b) the action to be taken will not involve any material risk
of the sale, forfeiture or loss of, or the creation of any Lien on (except a
Permitted Lien or a Lien which Lessee shall have bonded in an amount and
manner reasonably satisfactory to such Tax Indemnitee), the Spare Parts or any
interest therein; (c) if such contest shall be conducted in a manner requiring
the payment of the claim, Lessee shall have advanced the amount required on an
after-tax basis; (d) no Event of Default shall have occurred and be continuing
and Lessor, or such other Tax Indemnitee as may be appropriate, shall be
receiving all amounts of Rent when payable, without reduction by reason of
such Tax; and (e) if such claim is a Special Claim, such Tax Indemnitee shall
have received a legal opinion (at the expense of Lessee) from counsel
reasonably satisfactory to such Tax Indemnitee indicating that a reasonable
basis for such contest exists. Such Tax Indemnitee and Lessee shall in good
faith consider the other party's views regarding the conduct of the contest.
Such Tax Indemnitee and Lessee shall provide to each other, upon request, such
reasonably obtainable information and such other reasonable assistance as may
be necessary or advisable for the effective evaluation or conduct of such
contest. Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of this Section 10.4, if at
any time Lessor waives its right of indemnification under this Section 10 in
respect of a claim, or if, after having received payment of indemnification
from Lessee hereunder in respect to such claim, Lessor tenders such payment to
Lessee, then Lessee shall not be entitled to contest, or to continue to
contest, any such claim. If any Tax Indemnitee or any of its affiliates shall
receive a refund of, or receive a credit for (or would have received such a
refund or credit but for a counterclaim or other claim not indemnified by
Lessee hereunder (a "deemed refund or credit")) all or any part of any Taxes
paid, reimbursed or

                                     21






































<PAGE>
 
advanced by or on behalf of Lessee pursuant to this Lease (including Sections 
10.1, 10.2 or this 10.4), the applicable Tax Indemnitee shall pay to Lessee 
within  10 days of such receipt (or, in the case of a deemed refund or credit,
within 10 days of the resolution of such contest), an amount equal to such 
refund or credit or deemed refund or credit (along with any interest on such 
amounts actually received from the applicable taxing authority fairly 
attributable to such amounts).

      10.5.  Tax Returns.  Lessee will provide such information as may be 
             -----------
reasonably requested by Lessor and reasonably obtainable by Lessee to enable 
Lessor to fulfill its tax filing requirements with respect to the transactions
contemplated hereby.  In the event that any return, statement or report is 
required to be made or filed with respect to any Tax indemnified against by 
Lessee under this Section 10, Lessee shall notify Lessor of such requirement 
and (a) to the extent permitted by law and requested by Lessor or required by 
law, make and file in its own name such return, statement or report in such 
manner as will show the ownership of each Item in Lessor and furnish Lessor 
with a copy of such return, statement or report or (b) where such return, 
statement or report is required to be in the name of or filed by Lessor,
prepare and furnish such return, statement or report for filing by Lessor in
such manner as shall be satisfactory to Lessor and send the same to Lessor for
filing no later than 30 days prior to the due date. Where Lessor is required
to make or file a return, statement or report reflecting items other than or
in addition to Taxes indemnified against by Lessee under this Section 10,
Lessee shall, upon Lessor's request, provide Lessor with information, within a
reasonable time, sufficient to permit such return, statement or report to be
properly made and timely filed.


     10.6.  Mutual Assistance.  Lessor, each Tax Indemnitee and Lessee agree 
            -----------------
to consider in good faith any reasonable modifications of the transaction 
described in this Lease that would reduce or eliminate any Tax imposed on 
either party as a result of such transaction and each such person shall 
cooperate in good faith in providing information on forms or otherwise so as 
to reduce or eliminate any Taxes subject to indemnification under this Lease. 
Without limiting the foregoing, Lessor and Lessee shall cooperate (without any
expense to Lessor) as to the location of each Item at each Delivery Date in 
order to minimize or eliminate any sales or use Tax that might otherwise be 
payable in respect of the transactions contemplated hereby.


                                 SECTION 11
                               EVENTS OF LOSS
                               --------------

     11.1.  Loss of the Items.  Upon the occurrence of an Event of Loss with 
            -----------------
respect to any Item, Lessee shall forthwith (and in any event within 30 days 
after such occurrence) give Lessor written notice thereof and Lessee shall 
replace such Item as soon as reasonably possible (and, in any event, within 
120 days following such Event of Loss) by duly conveying to Lessor, free and 
clear of all Liens, except Permitted Lines, title to another Item of the 


                                     22

<PAGE>
 
same or an improved model and suitable for use on MD-11 aircraft, which Item 
shall have a value and utility at least equal to, and be in as good operating 
condition as, the Item with respect to which such Event of Loss shall have 
occurred, assuming such Item was of the value and utility and in the condition
and repair as required by the terms hereof immediately prior to the occurrence
of such Event of Loss. Such replacement item shall be deemed an "Item" as 
defined herein for all purposes hereunder. Lessee agrees to promptly notify 
Lessor of any such substitution, provide Lessor with an officer's certificate 
demonstrating full compliance with this Section 11.2 and Lessee agrees to take
such action and execute such documents, including a warranty bill of sale, as 
Lessor may reasonably request in order that any such replacement Item shall be
duly and properly titled in the name of Lessor and leased hereunder to the 
same extent as any Item replaced thereby. Lessor shall take such action and 
shall execute such documents as are reasonably necessary to convey the Item 
replaced pursuant to the preceding sentence to Lessee or its designee on an 
as-is, where-is basis, without recourse to or warranty by Lessor except that 
Lessor shall warrant that it has title free and clear of Lessor Liens and 
Liens existing prior to the Delivery Date of such Item.

     11.2.  Application of Payments from Governmental Authorities. Payments 
            -----------------------------------------------------
received by Lessor or Lessee from any governmental authority or entity with 
respect to an Event of Loss resulting from the condemnation, confiscation or 
seizure of, or requisition of title to any Item shall be retained by Lessee, 
or, if received by Lessor, promptly paid over to Lessee. Lessee shall promptly
replace such Item in accordance with Section 11.1. Payments received by Lessor
or Lessee with respect to periods after the end of the Term shall be paid to 
(or retained by) Lessor.

                                 SECTION 12
                                 INSURANCE
                                 ----------

     12.1  Public Liability, Bodily Injury and Property Damage Liability 
           -------------------------------------------------------------
Insurance. Lessee, at its own expense, shall maintain in effect third party 
- ---------
aircraft liability insurance, passenger legal liability insurance and property
damage liability insurance, including contractual liability and products 
liability insurance and war risk liability insurance in accordance with AV52 
or its equivalent, including the buyback of all war risk perils (except 
nuclear) during the Term in an amount not less than the greatest of (a) 
$700,000,000, (b) that amount normally carried by national and international 
carriers engaged in similar business and similarly situated to Lessee or (c) 
the amount normally carried by Lessee on its owned or leased MD-11 aircraft, 
for any one accident, or series of accidents arising out of any one event, 
with respect to the Items of Equipment. Any such liability insurance policy 
may be subject to a deductible in an amount not to exceed $1,250 each claim in
respect of passenger's baggage, or such other amount as is standard market 
deductible for baggage, and $5,000 each claim in respect of freight. All such 
policies shall be maintained in effect with insurers and (subject to Section 
12.3 below) reinsurers of recognized

                                     23
<PAGE>
 
reputation and responsibility, reasonably satisfactory to Lessor. Any policies
of insurance and reinsurance carried in accordance with this Section 12.1 and 
any policies taken out in substitution or replacement for any of such policies
shall: (i) name, as additional insureds, Lessor, Credit Lyonnais and their 
respective successors and assigns (notice of which assignment or successor and
the address of the new party and the fax and the telex numbers of all parties 
having been supplied to Lessee's insurance broker) (collectively, the 
"Additional Insureds"); (ii) provide that in respect of the interests of the
Additional Insureds such policies of insurance shall insure the Additional 
Insureds regardless of any breach or violation of any warranty, declarations 
or conditions contained in such policies by Lessee; and (iii) provide that if 
such insurance is cancelled for any reason whatever, or the same is allowed to
lapse for nonpayment of premium, or if there is any adverse change in policy 
terms and conditions, such cancellation, lapse or change shall not be 
effective until 30 days (and with respect to war risk insurance, such shorter 
period as shall be customary in the worldwide aviation insurance market for 
such insurance in such area of the world) after receipt by the Additional 
Insureds of written notice from such insurers of such cancellation, lapse or 
change. Each liability policy shall (A) be primary without right of 
contribution from any other insurance which is carried by the Additional 
Insureds, (B) expressly provide that all of the provisions thereof, except the
limits of liability, shall operate in the same manner as if there were a 
separate policy covering each insured, but this shall not operate in respect 
of loss of or damage to the Spare Parts insured under the Spares Policies 
issued to Lessee, (C) provide that the insurers agree to waive any right of 
subrogation against any Additional Insured but only to the extent that the 
Lessee has waived its right of recovery against the Additional Insured; and 
(D) provide for world wide coverage in full force and effect throughout any 
geographical areas (except as are excluded from War Risk coverage) where any 
Item is located. Without increasing the scope of coverage under the airline 
liability policies, the insurers thereunder shall acknowledge the existence of
the indemnification provisions of this Lease.

     12.2. Insurance Against Loss or Damage to the Spare Parts. Lessee, at its
           ---------------------------------------------------
own expense, shall maintain in effect with insurers and (subject to Section
12.3 below) reinsurers of recognized reputation and financial responsibility:
(a) all-risk spares coverage with respect to the Items of Equipment while
removed from the aircraft and replaced; and (b) war risk, hijacking (air
piracy), confiscation, nationalization, expropriation, and related perils 
coverages. All such insurance shall be in full force and effect throughout any
geographical areas (except as are excluded from War Risk coverage) where any 
Item is located, shall be payable in Dollars in the United States and shall be
in an amount of not less than the aggregate Lessor's Cost of all Items. Any 
insurance carried in accordance with this Section 12.2 shall not contain a 
provision for deductible or self-insured amounts in excess of $25,000. Any 
policies carried in accordance with this Section 12.2 shall (i) name the 
Lessor and the Lessee as loss payees; (ii) be made payable as provided in 
Sections 12.5 and 12.6 below; (iii) provide that if such insurance is 
cancelled for any reason whatever, or the same is allowed to lapse for 
nonpayment of premium, or if there is any adverse change in policy terms and 
conditions, such cancellation, lapse or change shall not be effective until 30
days (and with

                                     24











<PAGE>
 
respect to war risk insurance, such shorter period as shall be customary in 
the worldwide aviation insurance market for such insurance in such area of the
world) after receipt by the Additional Insureds of written notice from such 
insurers of such cancellation, lapse or change; (iv) provide that in respect 
of the interests of the Additional Insureds in such policies the insurance 
shall insure the Additional Insureds regardless of any breach or violation of 
any warranties, declarations or conditions contained in such policies by
Lessee; (v) include waivers by the insurers of any rights of subrogation or
set-off, counterclaim or other deduction whether by attachment or otherwise,
in respect of any liability of any Additional Insured but only to the extent
that the Lessee has waived its right of recovery against the Additional
Insured; (vi) be primary without right of contribution from any other
insurance which is carried by any Additional Insured as respects contingent
spares coverage; and (vii) provide that the Spares Policy shall be endorsed to
include a "50/50" clause in accordance with clause AVS 103 or its equivalent.

     Lessee may obtain additional spares and liability insurance on the Spare 
Parts, over and above the amounts required hereunder.

     12.3  Reinsurance. The risks required to be insured against pursuant to 
           -----------
Sections 12.1 and 12.2 shall be either directly placed in the worldwide 
aviation insurance market or shall be fully reinsured in the London, French, 
American and/or Nordic markets (or any other market acceptable to Lessor) with
reinsurance companies or underwriters reasonably acceptable to Lessor (the 
"Foreign Reinsurers"). All such reinsurance shall comply with all the terms 
and conditions for insurance required by this Section 12. With respect to 
reinsurance for the risks required to be insured against pursuant to Section 
12.2 above, the Foreign Reinsurers shall be directly liable to the Additional 
Insureds for all claims arising under such reinsurance in accordance with 
"cut-through" endorsements in which the Foreign Reinsurers agree to make 
payment of reinsurance proceeds directly to the Additional Insureds in 
accordance with Sections 12.5 and 12.6. Payment directly to the Additional 
Insureds shall be considered a complete discharge of the Foreign Reinsurers' 
liability to Lessee's primary insurers (the "Local Insurers"). The Local 
Insurers shall agree that, upon knowledge of any loss or losses which may give
rise to a claim under any reinsurance policy, they shall promptly advise the 
Foreign Reinsurers thereof and shall promptly furnish the Foreign Reinsurers 
with all information available from time to time respecting any loss or losses
which may be insured under such reinsurance policies, but any failure to give 
such notice or furnish such information shall not affect any Foreign 
Reinsurer's liability to the Additional Insureds under any reinsurance 
policy provided that such Foreign Reinsurer has received notice of such loss 
or losses from some other source. The Local Insurers shall agree that the 
Foreign Reinsurers, at their option, shall also have the right to appoint 
adjusters, assessors and/or surveyors and to control any loss or losses insured
under such reinsurance policies, but failure by the Local Insurers to abide by
the foregoing agreement shall not affect any Foreign Reinsurer's liability to 
the Additional Insureds under the reinsurance policy.

                                     25
<PAGE>
 
     12.4.  Replacement Insurance. If Lessee shall fail to maintain any or all 
            ---------------------
of the insurance as provided in this Section 12, Lessor may at its option 
provide such insurance and, in such event, Lessee shall demand, reimburse 
Lessor as Supplemental Rent, for the cost thereof plus interest at the 
Incentive Rate. Provided that Lessor has received not less than three Business 
Days notice of Lessee's failure to maintain the required insurance, Lessor 
shall give Lessee not less than one Business Day's notice prior to the 
placement of substitute insurance by Lessor.

     12.5.  Application of Proceeds in an Event of Loss of all Spare Parts.  
            --------------------------------------------------------------
All payments under spares insurance policies required to be maintained 
hereunder as the result of the occurrence of an Event of Loss with respect to 
all the Items of Equipment subject hereto shall be applied as follows: Lessor 
and Lessee shall proceed diligently and cooperate fully with each other in the
recovery of any and all proceeds of insurance applicable thereto, and so much 
of such insurance proceeds as shall not exceed the aggregate Lessor's Cost 
hereunder shall be paid to Lessor. Any proceeds of insurance maintained by 
Lessee in excess of the sums due under Section 11.1 or received after full 
payment of the sums due under Section 11.1 shall be payable to Lessee.

            In any event Lessor shall be entitled to receive all insurance
proceeds derived from insurance coverage paid for by Lessor,

     12.6.  Application of Proceeds in the Absence of a Total Event of Loss. As
            ---------------------------------------------------------------
between Lessor and Lessee, the insurance payments for an Event of Loss with 
respect to any Item of Equipment not constituting an Event of Loss with 
respect to all Items will be applied as follows:

     (a)    in respect of a claim for damage not exceeding $250,00 any payment 
from the insurers and/or reinsurers shall be released directly to Lessee, or 
to a vendor, for replacement of the Items; and

     (b)    in respect of a claim where damage exceeds $250,000 any payment 
from the insurers and/or reinsurers shall be payable to Lessor, but will be 
paid over to Lessee in reimbursement for completed repairs or, where the 
approved work has been contracted out, will be paid over to the repairer, or 
for replacement of the lost or damaged Items.

     Any amount referred to in this Section 12.6 which is payable to Lessee 
shall not be paid to Lessee if at the time of such payment an Event of Default
shall have occurred and be continuing, but shall be held by Lessor as security
for the obligations of Lessee under this Lease and such amount shall be paid to
Lessee at such time as there no longer exists any Default or Event of Default.

     12.7.  Reports, etc. Lessee and Lessee's independent insurance broker shall
            ------------
advise Lessor in writing promptly of any default in the payment of any premium
and of any other

                                     26




    
<PAGE>
 
act or omission on the part of Lessee which might invalidate or render 
unenforceable, in whole or in part, any insurance or reinsurance on the Items 
of Equipment. No notice from broker shall be required unless such broker has 
knowledge of such act or omission. On the Delivery Date and at least 10 days 
prior to the expiration or termination date of any insurance policy maintained
with respect to the Items of Equipment pursuant to this Section 12, Lessee 
shall provide Lessor with a new certificate of insurance executed by an 
independent aircraft insurance broker and the written opinion of such broker 
as to Lessee's continued compliance with the provisions of this Section 12.

     12.8 Lessor's Additional Insurance. Lessor, at its option and at its sole
          -----------------------------
expense, may obtain insurance with respect to the Items of Equipment; 
provided, that no such insurance shall have the effect of making more 
expensive, suspending, impairing, defeating, invalidating or rendering 
unenforceable or reducing, in whole or in part, the coverage of or the 
proceeds payable under any insurance required to be provided and maintained by 
Lessee pursuant to this Section 12.

     12.9. Lessor Not Liable For Premiums. All policies of insurance and 
           ------------------------------
reinsurance carried hereunder shall clearly state that none of the Additional 
Insureds or any assignee thereof, shall have any liability for or obligation 
with respect to premiums, commissions, assessments or calls.

     12.10. Government Indemnity. Notwithstanding any other provision of this 
            --------------------
Lease requiring Lessee to maintain insurance, Lessor agrees to accept, in lieu
of insurance against any risk with respect to the Items of Equipment, 
indemnification from the United States Government or any agency or 
instrumentality thereof or Title XIII Insurance issued by the FAA or any 
agency or department of the United States Government, or any substantially 
similar successor or replacement program of the United States Government, 
against such risk in an amount which, when added to the amount of insurance 
against such risk maintained by Lessee (including permitted self-insurance as 
set forth herein) with respect to the Items of Equipment, shall be at least 
equal to the amount of insurance against such risk otherwise required by this 
Section 12.

                           GENERAL INDEMNIFICATION
                           -----------------------

     13.1. Scope. Lessee shall hold Lessor and its successors, assigns, 
           -----
officers, directors, employees and agents (each an "Indemnitee") harmless 
from any and all claims, demands, suits, causes of action and all legal 
proceedings, whether civil or criminal, damages, losses, liabilities 
(including, but not limited to, strict liability in tort), obligations, 
penalties, judgments or fines and other sanctions, and any costs and expenses 
in connection therewith, including reasonable legal fees and expenses of 
whatever kind and nature ("Loss") which may result from or arise out of (a) 
the condition, use or operation during the Term of any

                                     27
<PAGE>
 
Item of Equipment either in the air or on the ground, or (b) any maintenance, 
service, repair, overhaul or testing of any Item during the Term, whether or 
not such Item is at the time in the possession of Lessee; provided, however, 
that Lessee shall not be required to indemnify any Indemnitee, (i) to the 
extent that a Loss is caused by acts or events which occur prior to the 
Delivery Date of such Item or after full and final compliance by Lessee with 
all terms of the Lease, (ii) for any Tax or a loss of tax benefit (it being 
understood that Section 10 provides for Lessee's sole liability with respect 
to Taxes), (iii) for a Loss which results solely from the gross negligence or 
willful misconduct of any Indemnitee, (iv) to the extent an Indemnitee suffers
a Loss as a result of (A) the voluntary transfer of any Item or the voluntary 
disposition of any Item by any Indemnitee other than pursuant to Sections 11 
or 17 of this Lease, (B) a transfer or disposition of any Item by any 
Indemnitee from bankruptcy or other proceedings for the relief of debtors in 
which any Indemnitee is the debtor, whether voluntary or involuntary, or (C) 
the breach by an Indemnitee of its covenants, representations or warranties 
contained herein or in any other agreement delivered in connection herewith.

     Nothing herein shall be deemed to constitute a guaranty of any useful life
or present or future residual value of any Item.

     If an Indemnitee has actual knowledge of any claim or liability 
indemnified against under this Section 13, it shall give prompt written notice
thereof to the Lessee. In case any action, suit or proceeding shall be brought
against any Indemnitee for which indemnity may be sought under this Section 
13, such Indemnitee shall notify Lessee of the commencement thereof, and 
Lessee may, at its expense, participate in and, to the extent that it shall 
wish assume the defense thereof, with counsel reasonably satisfactory to such 
Indemnity; provided, that no Event of Default shall have occurred and be 
continuing pursuant to which the Lessor is exercising its remedies under 
Section 17 of this Lease. If Lessee assumes the defense of such action, suit 
or proceeding, such Indemnitee may participate in such defense at such 
Indemnitee's expense; provided, however, that if in the written opinion of 
counsel to such Indemnitee an actual or potential material conflict of 
interest exists where it is advisable for such Indemnitee to be represented by
separate counsel, the reasonable fees and expenses of such separate counsel 
shall be borne by the Lessee. With respect to any amount which the Lessee is 
requested by an Indemnitee to pay by reason of this Section 13, the Indemnitee
shall, if requested by the Lessee and prior to any payment, submit such 
additional information to the Lessee the Lessee may reasonably request 
properly to substantiate the requested payment. Notwithstanding the foregoing,
the failure of any Indemnitee entitled to indemnity hereunder to notify the 
Lessee as provided in this Section 13 shall not relieve the Lessee from any 
liability it may have to any Indemnitee entitled to indemnify under this 
Section 13 except to the extent delay in receiving notice increased the amount
due from Lessee under this Section 13.

                                     28
<PAGE>
 
     If Lessee has indemnified an Indemnitee for any Loss, the Lessee shall be
subrogated to any right of the Indemnitee in respect of the matter against 
which such indemnity  has been paid.

     13.2. Lessee's Release. Lessee hereby waives and releases any claim now 
           ----------------
or hereafter existing against any Indemnitee on account of any and all claims,
demands, suits, causes of action and all legal proceedings, whether civil or 
criminal, damages, losses, liabilities (including, but not limited to, strict 
liability in tort), obligations, penalties, judgments or fines and other 
sanctions, and any costs and expenses in connection therewith, including 
reasonable legal fees and expenses of whatever kind and nature, which may 
result from or arise out of injury to or death of personnel of Lessee or loss 
or damage to property of Lessee or the loss of use of any property which may 
result from or arise out of (a) the condition, use or operation during the 
Term of any Item of Equipment, either in the air or on the ground, or (b) any 
maintenance, service, repair, overhaul or testing of any Item during the Term,
whether or not such Item is at the time in the possession of Lessee, unless 
resulting solely from the gross negligence or willful misconduct of such 
Indemnitee. 

     13.3 Contest. If Lessee is not permitted to contest in its own name and 
          -------
if an Indemnitee is unable to assign to Lessee whatever right such Indemnitee 
may have to bring such an action, then if requested by Lessee in writing, 
Lessor shall upon receipt of an opinion of Lessee's counsel stating that 
reasonable grounds exist to take the action requested, in good faith contest 
the validity, applicability or amount of any liability or loss which Lessor 
may incur as a result of its contesting an indemnified amount (an 
"Indemnified Amount") by (a) resisting payment thereof, (b) not paying the 
same except under protest if protest is necessary and proper, or (c) if payment
is made, using reasonable efforts to obtain a refund in appropriate 
administrative or judicial proceedings; provided, however, that Lessor need 
not contest the applicability of any such Indemnified Amount, if the matter in
question is of a continuing nature and has previously been resolved pursuant 
to the provisions of this Section 13.3.

     13.4. Repayment. If an Indemnitee shall obtain a repayment of any 
           ---------
Indemnified Amount paid by Lessee, such Indemnitee shall promptly pay to 
Lessee the amount of such repayment, together with the amount of any interest 
received by such Indemnitee on account of such repayment.

     13.5. Payment. Subject to the provisions of Section 13.3 hereof, Lessee
           -------
shall pay directly to each party indemnified hereunder all amounts due under 
this Section 13 within 30 days of the receipt of notice that such payment is 
due.

                                   LIENS
                                   -----

     Lessee shall not, directly or indirectly create, incur, assume or suffer
to exist any Lien on or with respect to any Item of Equipment or any interest 
therein, except Permitted Liens.  Lessee shall promptly, at its own expense, 
take such action as may be necessary to duly discharge any Lien not excepted 
above if the same shall arise at any time with respect to any Item of 
Equipment.

                     RETURN OF SPARE PARTS AND RECORDS 
                     ---------------------------------

     This Section 15 shall not limit any rights or remedies of Lessor under 
Section 17.

     15.1.  Location: Storage.  At the end of the Term (whether at the last day
            -----------------
of the Term or the earlier termination of the Lease), Lessee shall return the
Spare Parts to Lessor at any airport in the continental United States 
designated by Lessor, or at any other mutually agreeable location.  Inspection 
and technical acceptance of the Spare Parts shall take place at the return 
location.  Spare Parts Records and maintenance work documents shall be 
inspected and accepted at Lessee's headquarters except that Lessee shall pay 
for shipment of such records to Lessor.

     The Spare Parts shall be properly packed for shipping and shall be 
returned in the same working order, condition and appearance as when received 
pursuant to this Lease (reasonable wear and tear excepted), in serviceable 
condition and fresh from overhaul (with overhaul tag attached), clean by 
international commercial airline standards and ready for installation on an 
FAA registered aircraft operating under FAR Part 121.  All Items of Equipment 
shall be free and clear of all Liens or other encumbrances of any kind, other 
than Lessor Liens.

     Following completion of the Final Inspection (as described in Section 
15.7) and any repairs or maintenance by this Section 15, Lessor and Lessee 
shall execute (a) a Certificate of Technical Acceptance, similar in form to 
the Lease Supplements, evidencing the return of the Spare Parts and records to
Lessor and the condition thereof and (b) a Lease Termination Instrument, for 
the purpose of removing this Lease from the FAA records.

     15.2.  Replacement Items.  Lessee will return all Items of Equipment to
            -----------------
Lessor, subject only to those replacements, additions and modifications which 
may have been made and properly documented pursuant to this Lease or as 
otherwise specifically approved in writing by Lessor.  Lessee shall, at least 
30 days prior to the last day of the Term, furnish Lessor with a listing of 
all such Items to be returned, identified by part number and serial 


                                     30










<PAGE>
 
number, and shall deliver to Lessor a technical report listing the 
modification standard and, without prejudice to the second paragraph of 
Section 15.1 above, if the Item is a time-controlled component under Lessee's
Maintenance Program, the hours and cycles accumulated since the last overhaul 
and the date of the last overhaul.

     15.3. Maintenance. Lessee agrees to furnish due evidence that all 
           -----------
service, maintenance, repairs, overhauls and modifications required under this
Lease have been performed in accordance with the Maintenance Program.

     15.4. Final Inspection and Specific Return Conditions. Immediately prior 
           -----------------------------------------------
to the return of the Spare Parts to Lessor, at Lessee's own expense:

           (a) Lessee shall make all of the Items of Equipment available to 
Lessor for the purpose of conducting a detailed inspection in order to verify 
that the condition of the Items complies with the requirements set forth in 
this Section 15 (such inspection being referred to herein as the "Final 
Inspection"). Such Final Inspection shall take place at the location of 
Lessee's primary spare parts depot or other mutually acceptable maintenance 
facility and Lessee shall give Lessor not less than 30 days prior written 
notice of the location and commencement date of such Final Inspection. To the 
extent that any portion of a Final Inspection extends beyond the last day of 
the Term because of work required by this Section 15, the Term of this Lease 
with respect to the Items undergoing the Final Inspection shall be deemed to 
have been automatically extended, and the obligation to pay Basic Rent 
hereunder continued on a pro-rated daily basis until the Final Inspection and 
all necessary work on the Items shall have been concluded;

           (b) Lessee shall carry out on each Item the final completion of all
deferred maintenance items and service bulletins as required in Section 6 
hereof and shall complete, on a terminating action or repetitive inspection 
basis, as appropriate, all Airworthiness Directives issued by the FAA which 
become effective on or before the date of return of the Spare Parts. Unless 
approved in writing by Lessor, Lessee shall not request a waiver or delay in AD
compliance with respect to any Item of Equipment;

           (c) All time-controlled components of the Spare Parts shall be 
returned in zero time condition, and all components of the Spare Parts shall 
be in fully serviceable condition and shall have an overhaul tag attached; and

           (d) All Items shall be boxed and crated for shipment immediately 
following the Final Inspection.

     15.5. Component Manuals and Documentation. Following the Final Inspection
           -----------------------------------
and immediately prior to the return of the Spare Parts to Lessor, Lessee 
shall: deliver to Lessor the Spare Parts Records, in current, up to date 
status and all logs, data, inspection,

                                     31
<PAGE>
 
modification and overhaul records required to be maintained with respect to 
such Items of Equipment under any applicable rules and regulations of the FAA.

           Notwithstanding the foregoing, in order to enable Lessor to prepare 
for attendance at the Final Inspection of the Spare Parts pursuant to Section 
15.7, Lessee shall make available to Lessor at a time reasonably in advance of 
the Final Inspection, all necessary Spare Parts Records and such other 
documents relating to the use, maintenance and operation of the Spare Parts as
Lessor shall reasonably request.

     15.6. Corrections and Subsequent Corrections. To the extent that any Item 
           --------------------------------------
fails to conform to any requirement imposed by this Section 15, Lessor may, at
its option, (i) continue the Lease in effect as to such Item on a day-to-day 
basis until such time as the Item is brought into compliance or, (ii) accept 
the return of the Item and thereafter have any such nonconformance corrected 
as soon as Lessor may reasonably arrange, at commercial rates then charged by
the person selected by Lessor to perform such correction. Any expense incurred
by Lessor for such correction shall become Supplemental Rent payable by Lessee
within 30 days following the submission of a written statement by Lessor to
Lessee, identifying the items corrected and setting forth the expense of such
correction. Lessee's obligation to pay such Supplemental Rent shall survive
the last day of the Term or other termination of this Lease .

                              EVENTS OF DEFAULT

reasonable measures, so that it could be remedied promptly thereafter; or

     (d) Any representation or warranty made by Lessee herein or in any

                                     33

                             RIGHTS AND REMEDIES
                             -------------------

     17.1  Remedies. Upon the occurrence of any Event of Default and at any 
           --------
time thereafter so long as the same shall be continuing, Lessor may, at its 
option, declare this Lease to be in default and at any time thereafter, so 
long as Lessee shall not have remedied all outstanding Events of Default, 
Lessor may exercise one or more of the following remedies with respect to any 
or all of the Items of Equipment as Lessor, in its sole discretion, shall 
elect, to the extent available and permitted by, and subject to compliance 
with any mandatory requirements of, applicable law then in effect:

                                     34
<PAGE>
 
     (a)  Pursuant to Section 4.4, apply all or any portion of the Security 
Deposit to Lessor's damages attributable to such Event of Default or to the 
costs of curing such Event of Default; provided, however, the Event of Default
shall continue until the Security Deposit is restored to its original amount.

     (b)  Proceed by appropriate court action or actions, either at law or in
equity, to enforce performance by Lessee of the applicable covenants of this 
Lease and to recover damages for the breach thereof.

     (c)  Terminate this Lease and demand that Lessee, and Lessee shall upon 
written demand of Lessor and at Lessee's expense, forthwith return the Spare 
Parts to Lessor in the manner and condition required by, and otherwise in 
accordance with all of the provisions of, Section 15 hereof as if the Spare 
parts were being returned at the end of the Term; or Lessor may enter upon the
premises where the Spare Parts are located and take immediate possession of 
and remove the same by summary proceedings or otherwise, all without liability
for or by reason of such entry or taking of possession whether for the 
restoration of damage to property caused by such taking or otherwise.

     (d)  In addition to all other legal and equitable rights of Lessor, upon 
notice to Lessee, Lessor may, following an Event of Default:

          (i)  lease the repossessed Spare parts or any Item thereof to any 
   third party upon such terms and conditions as Lessor may determine;

          (ii) sell the Spare Parts, or any Item, to the highest bidder at 
   public auction or private sale.

The total proceeds of any such leases and/or sales, less expenses of Lessor 
(including attorneys' fees), to the extent actually received and retained by 
Lessor, shall be applied to the total amount due to Lessor as provided herein 
and Lessee shall immediately pay to Lessor any deficiency.

     (e)  On the date on which Lessor shall become entitled to repossession 
of the Spare Parts, Lessor, in addition to all other remedies herein provided,
may by notice to Lessee, demand that Lessee pay, and Lessee shall pay, on the 
first Basic Rent Payment Date following said notice, (i) any due and unpaid 
Basic Rent and Supplemental Rent, together with interest at the Incentive Rate
from the due date to the date the same are paid, and (ii) as liquidated 
damages for loss of a bargain and not as a penalty, an amount equal to the 
difference between (a) the sum of all remaining payments of Basic Rent falling
due hereunder after the date of said notice, discounted to the date of said 
notice at a rate of interest equal to the Prime Rate on a monthly basis, and 
(b) the fair market rental (as determined by an independent aviation appraiser
of recognized standing, selected by Lessor) of the Spare parts for the 
remaining Term, discounted at the same rate and frequency

                                     35





<PAGE>
 
specified in (i) above; provided, however, if Lessor has already leased the 
Spare Parts as permitted by Section 17.1(d)(i) above, the rental specified in 
such lease (if it is on substantially the same terms and conditions as this 
Lease) shall be conclusive as to the ``fair market rental''.

     17.2. Further Rights. Lessee shall be liable for any and all unpaid Rent 
           --------------
and for all reasonable legal fees and other costs and expenses incurred by 
reason of the occurrence of any Event of Default or the exercise of Lessor's 
remedies with respect thereto, including all costs and expenses incurred in 
connection with the return of any Item in accordance with the terms of Section
15 hereof or in placing such Item in the condition and with airworthiness 
certificates as required by Section 15.

     17.3. Remedies Cumulative. Except as otherwise expressly provided in 
          -------------------
Section 18.1 hereof, no remedy referred to in this Section 17 is intended to 
be exclusive, but each shall be cumulative and in addition to any other remedy
referred to above or otherwise available to Lessor at law or in equity; and 
the exercise or beginning of exercise by Lessor of any one or more of such 
remedies shall not preclude the simultaneous or later exercise by Lessor of 
any or all of such other remedies. No express or implied waiver by Lessor of 
any Event of Default shall in any way be, or be construed to be, a waiver of 
any future or further Event of Default.

                                 SECTION 18
                                MISCELLANEOUS

     18.1. Severability, Amendment, Construction and Applicable Law. Any
           --------------------------------------------------------
provision of this Lease which is prohibited or unenforceable in any 
jurisdiction shall, as to such jurisdiction, be ineffective to the extent of 
such prohibition or unenforceability without invalidating the remaining 
provisions hereof, and any such prohibition or unenforceability in any 
jurisdiction shall not invalidate or render unenforceable such provision in 
any other jurisdiction. No term or provision of this Lease may be changed, 
waived, discharged or terminated orally, but only by a written instrument 
signed by the party against which the enforcement of the change, waiver, 
discharge or termination is sought. The captions in this Lease are for 
convenience of reference only and shall not define or limit any of the terms

MATTERS OF CONSTRUCTION, VALIDITY AND PERFORMANCE.

or to such other address as any party may designate for itself by written 
notice to the other party.

     18.3. Lessor's Right to Perform. If Lessee fails to perform any of its 
           -------------------------
obligations hereunder, Lessor may, following five days (or one Business Day in
the case of insurance) notice to Lessee, discharge such obligation, and the 
amount of the expenses of Lessor incurred in connection with such discharge, 
together with interest thereon at the Incentive Rate, shall be deemed 
Supplemental Rent, payable by Lessee upon Lessor's demand.

     18.4. Counterparts. At least three counterparts of this Lease have been 
           ------------
executed by the parties hereto, each of which shall be deemed to be an 
original but all of which taken together shall constitute a single agreement. 
One counterpart has been prominently marked "Lessor's Copy"; one counterpart
has been prominently marked "FAA Copy" and shall be filed for recordation 
with the FAA.

     18.5. Assignment by Lessor. Lessor shall have the absolute right to 
           --------------------
transfer or assign to any person, firm, corporation or other entity any or all 
of Lessor's rights, obligations, benefits and interests under this Lease, 
including, without limitation, the right to receive Rent or any other payment
due under this Lease, the right to transfer or assign title to any Item of 
Equipment and the right to make all waivers and agreements, to give all 
notices, consents and releases, to take all action upon the occurrence of an 
Event of Default, or to do any and all other things which Lessor is or may 
become entitled to do under this Lease. Lessee acknowledges that, if Lessor 
should sell or transfer to a third party all of Lessor's interest under this 
Lease and in the Spare Parts, Lessor shall thereupon be relieved of all of its
obligations hereunder and Lessor's transferee shall succeed to all of Lessor's 
rights, interests and obligations under this Lease as though Lessor's 
transferee had been the initial lessor hereunder; provided, however, that, in 
the event of a transfer or assignment of less than the entire interest of 
Lessor or of a security interest in any Item, Lessor shall remain liable 
hereunder. In the event of a transfer of Lessor's entire interest in the Spare
Parts and the Lease, except following an Event of Default, Lessor agrees that

                                     37
<PAGE>
 
such transferee will have a net worth of at least $50,000,000, unless the 
obligations of the Lessor hereunder are fully guaranteed by an entity with 
such a net worth.

     18.6. Service of Process; Waiver of Immunities. Lessee and Lessor each 
           ----------------------------------------
(a) irrevocably submits itself to the nonexclusive jurisdiction of the Supreme
Court of the State of New York, New York County, or the United States District
Court for the Southern District of New York, for the purpose of any suit, 
action or other proceeding arising out of this Lease, or the subject matter 
hereof or any of the transactions contemplated hereby or thereby, brought by 
Lessor or its successor, subrogees or assigns, (b) irrevocably agrees that all
claims in respect of such action or proceeding may be heard and determined in 
such New York State or United States Federal court and (c) to the extent that 
Lessee or Lessor has or hereafter may acquire any immunity from jurisdiction 
of any court or from any legal process, waives such immunity, and agrees not 
to assert, by way of motion, as a defense or otherwise, in any such suit, 
action or proceeding the defense of sovereign immunity, any claim that it is 
not personally subject to the jurisdiction of the above-named New York State 
or United States Federal courts by reason of sovereign immunity or otherwise, 
that it is immune from any legal process (whether through service or notice, 
attachment prior to judgment, attachment in aid of execution, execution or 
otherwise) with respect to itself or its property, or attachment either prior 
to judgment or on any day of execution, by reason of sovereign immunity, that 
the suit, action or proceeding is brought in an inconvenient forum, that the 
venue of the suit, action or proceeding is improper, or that this Lease or the
subject matter hereof may not be enforced in or by such courts.

     The obligations of Lessee payable under this Lease in one currency (the 
"first currency") may be discharged by an amount paid by Lessee pursuant to 
any order or judgment of any court or other tribunal in another currency (a 
"second currency"), but only to the extent that the amount so paid in a 
second currency  on prompt conversion to the first currency under normal 
banking procedures yields the amount of the first currency due hereunder, and 
Lessee shall indemnify Lessor and any other person entitled to payments 
hereunder against any such shortfall. In the event that any payment in a 
second currency by Lessee to any such person or entity, whether pursuant to a 
judgment or otherwise, upon conversion and transfer to the designated place of
payment therefore does not result in payment of such amount of the first 
currency, such person or entity shall have a separate cause of action against 
Lessee for the additional amount necessary to yield the amount due and owing 
to such person.

     18.7. Language. The English language version of this Lease will be the 
           --------
official, controlling version and any dispute over the interpretation of the 
Lease, whether directly between the parties or involving the courts of the 
United States or elsewhere, shall be resolved based upon the Lease as written
in the English language, any interpretation thereof into another language 
being merely for convenience of understanding. All notices, reports and other 
communications given under this Lease shall be in the English language.

     18.8. Costs and Expenses. Each party shall be responsible for its costs
           ------------------
and expenses, including attorneys' fees, of negotiation and documentation of 
this transaction. In the event of any litigation between the parties over this
Lease or the subject matter hereof, the prevailing party shall, in addition to
whatever other damages, costs and expenses are recovered, be entitled to 
recover its costs and expenses of such litigation, including attorneys' fees 
and expenses. Lessee shall be responsible for the cost, including attorneys' 
fees and expenses, of registering this Lease in any foreign jurisdiction.

     18.9. Survival. The indemnities of Lessee set forth in this Lease shall

required for full performance and satisfaction thereof.

     18.10. Further Assurances. Each party hereto shall, at its respective 
            ------------------
expense, promptly and duly execute and deliver to the other party such further
documents and promptly take such further action not inconsistent with the 
terms hereof as the other party may from time to time reasonably request in 
order to more effectively carry out the intent and purpose of this Lease or to
perfect and protect the rights and, with respect to Lessor, remedies created 
or intended to be created hereunder.

     18.11. Entire Agreement. This Lease and the Lease Supplements executed
            ----------------
pursuant hereto constitute the entire agreement between Lessor and Lessee 
regarding the Spare Parts and there are no other prior or contemporaneous 
written or oral understandings with regard to the subject matter hereof.

     18.12. Successors and Assigns. This Lease shall be binding on and shall 
            ----------------------
inure to the benefit of Lessee, Lessor and their respective successors and 
permitted assigns.

     IN WITNESS WHEREOF, Lessor and Lessee have each caused this Lease to be 
duly executed by their authorized officers as of the date first above written.

corporation duly incorporated and validly existing under the laws of the state
or county of its incorporation and is an air carrier of persons and property

          (c)  Governmental Approvals. Except for the filing of this Mortgage 
               ----------------------
and each Mortgage Supplement with the FAA, neither the making nor performance

against Mortgagor in accordance with its terms, subject to applicable 
bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, moratorium or similar laws affecting 
the rights of creditors generally and subject, as to enforceability, to 
general principles of equity (regardless of whether enforcement is sought in a
proceeding in equity or at law).

      4.  Limitations on Mortgagee's Obligations.  If required by Mortgagee,

any such Proceeds shall be deemed to be held in trust by Mortgagor for and as
the property of Mortgagee. Such Proceeds, when delivered, shall continue to be
Collateral for the Obligations of Mortgagor and shall not constitute payment
thereof.

     5.   Liens.  Mortgagor will not create, incur or suffer or permit to exist
          -----
any mortgage, pledge, lien, charge, encumbrance, lease, exercise of rights,

Liens and other Lien consented to in writing by Mortgagee.  The Obligations

and security interest created by this Mortgage, to recover judgment for any 
Obligation due and owing and to collect the same out of the Engine or the 
Proceeds of any sale thereof;

        (c) institute legal proceedings for the sale, under the judgment or 
decree of any court of competent jurisdiction, of the entirety or any part of 
the Engine; or

        (d) personally or by agents or attorneys enter upon any premises where
the Engine or any portion thereof may then be located and take possession of 
all or any part thereof, and hold, store and keep idle or lease, operate or 
otherwise use or permit the use of, the Engine or any portion thereof, for 
such time and upon such terms as Mortgagee may in its discretion deem to be in
its best interest, and demand, collect and retain all rent, earnings and other
sums due and to become due in respect of the same from any party, accounting 
for net earnings, if any, arising from such use and charging against all 
receipts from the use of the same or from the sale thereof, by court 
proceedings or pursuant to the provisions below, all other costs, expenses, 
charges, damages and other losses resulting from such use.

        If Mortgagee elects to foreclose upon and against the lien and

upon demand of Mortgagee, deliver to Mortgagee such property at such time or 
times and place or places as Mortgagee may reasonably specify; and Mortgagee 
is hereby authorized and empowered, to the extent permitted by applicable law,

dispose of, or cause to be sold, leased and disposed of, the entirety or any 
part of the Engine at one or more public or private sales, leasing or other 
dispositions, at such places and times and on such terms and conditions as 
Mortgagee may deem fit, provided that at any such sale Mortgagor or Mortgagee 
may bid for and purchase such property. If practicable or if required by law, 
Mortgagee agrees to provide Mortgagor prior written notice of the date
<PAGE>
 
fixed for any public sale of the Engine or of the date on or after which will

applicable law, the Proceeds of any sale, lease or other disposition of

priority:

<PAGE>
 
          "Substitute Collateral" shall mean either (a) an engine suitable for
installation on DC-10-30 or MD-11 aircraft which has a Value of at least the 
Minimum Value after subtracting from such Value the outstanding amount of any 
senior lien then on such engine (it being understood that an engine with more 
than one senior lien (not counting Permitted Liens) will not be eligible to be
Substitute Collateral), (b) a letter of credit from a bank reasonably 
acceptable to the Mortgagee with face amount equal to the Minimum Value and in
form reasonably acceptable to the Mortgagee or (c) other collateral reasonably
acceptable to the Mortgagee. To constitute Substitute Collateral under clause 
(a) or (c), World must grant to the Mortgagee a perfected Lien thereon, 
subject to no other Liens other than Permitted Liens and one senior Lien.

          "Value" shall mean the fair market sales value of the asset in 
question as mutually agreed by World and the Mortgagee, or failing such 
agreement within 15 days after request therefor by either party, by an 
independent appraiser mutually agreed to by World and the Mortgagee. The fair 
market sales value shall be the cash sale price of the asset in question which
would be realized by a lienholder selling the asset in a foreclosure context 
and shall assume the asset to be in the lesser of its actual condition or 
one-half time between overhauls or major repairs. The costs of the appraiser, 
if any, shall be paid by World.

          "Minimum Value" shall mean $2.0 million until December 31, 1994 and 
$1.0 million thereafter, provided that no Event of Default has occurred at any
time under the Aircraft Lease or Spares Lease.

     IN WITNESS WHEREOF, the undersigned have executed this Mortgage as of the
day and year first above written.

                                        [To be dated the Delivery Date]


GATX Capital Corporation
Four Embarcadero Center
Suite 2200
San Francisco, CA 94111

Gentlemen and Ladies:

     I have acted as counsel for WORLD AIRWAYS, INC., a corporation organized 
under the laws of the State of Delaware ("Lessee"), in connection with that 
certain Spare Parts Lease Agreement dated as of April 15, 1993 (the "Lease") 
between GATX CAPITAL CORPORATION, a corporation organized under the laws of the
State of Delaware ("Lessor"), and Lessee. Unless otherwise defined herein, all
capitalized terms used herein shall have the meanings given such terms in the 
Lease.

     In connection with this transaction, I have reviewed such records and 
documents and matters of law as I have deemed necessary for the purposes of 
this opinion.

     In giving the opinions expressed below, I have relied upon the following 
assumptions:

     (a) the genuineness of all signatures (other than those of Lessee's 
officers) and the conformity with the original documents submitted to me as 
copies;

     (b) the legal right, authority and power of Lessor under all relevant 
laws to enter into, execute, deliver and perform its obligations under the 
Lease; and

     (c) that the Lease has been duly authorized by Lessor in accordance with 
all relevant laws.

     Based on the assumptions set forth above, I am of the following opinion:

     (1) Lessee has been duly incorporated, is validly existing as a 
corporation in good standing under the laws of the State of Delaware, is
qualified to do business in all locations material to its operation, and has
full corporate power and authority to carry on the business in which it is
presently engaged, and to perform its obligations under the Lease.

     (2) The execution and delivery of the Lease and the Lease Supplements 
(hereinafter referred to as the "Lease Documents"), the consummation by Lessee
of the transactions therein contemplated and compliance by Lessee with the 
terms and provisions thereof do not and will not result in the violation of 
the provisions of the certificate of incorporation or the bylaws of Lessee as 
in effect on the date hereof; and do not and will not conflict with or result 
in a breach of any terms or provisions of, or constitute a default under, or 
result in the creation or imposition of any Lien upon any property or assets 
of Lessee, under any indenture, mortgage, or other agreement or instrument to 
which Lessee is a party or by which it or any of its properties are or may be 
bound, or any existing applicable law, rule or regulation, or any judgment, or
order or decree now in effect, or any government, governmental instrumentality
or court having jurisdiction over Lessee or any of its activities or 
properties.

     (3) The Lease Documents have been duly authorized, executed and delivered
by Lessee, and each such instrument is a valid, enforceable and binding
obligation of Lessee, in accordance with its terms, except as enforceability
may be limited by bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization or other laws of
general application affecting the enforcement of creditors' rights.

     (4) To my knowledge, except as set forth in Lessee's quarterly or annual
filings with the Securities Exchange Commission which have been provided to
Lessor, there are no suits or proceedings pending or threatened against Lessee
or any subsidiary in any court or before any regulatory commission, board or
other administrative governmental agency against or affecting Lessee which
relate to the transactions contemplated hereby or which, if adversely
determined, would have a material adverse effect on the ability of Lessee to
perform its obligations under the Lease.

     (5) Lessee holds all licenses, certificates and permits from the FAA and
any other applicable governmental authorities necessary for the conduct of its
business as an air carrier.

     (6) No authorization, approval, consent, license or order of, or
registration with, or the giving of notice to any regulatory body or authority
is required for the valid authorization, execution, delivery and performance 
by Lessee of the Lease Documents, except such filings of the Lease Documents 
which have already been made or as may be required by the FAA.

                             Basic Rent Schedule

The payment of Basic Rent due on any Basic Rent Payment Date will be the sum
of the Fixed Rent and the Variable Rent. The Fixed Rent is listed below. The
Variable Rent shall be the product of the applicable Prime Rate (represented
as an annual rate) and the Variable Factor listed below. For example, if the
applicable Prime Rate for rent due 8/1/93 is 6%, then the Variable Rent will
equal (833333.3333 *.06) or $50,000. Using this example the Basic Rent due on
8/1/93 will be $62,500.

(including those contained in Article 13 thereof) relating to such exercise 
shall apply to and be binding upon Agent to the same extent as Buyer.

     time elapsed from the moment at which an aircraft moves under its own power
     from its parking position for the purpose of taking off until the moment at
     which it comes to rest at the end of a flight in a parked position.

3.5  Any deviation from the terms and conditions set out in this Agreement
     subsequently made at the request of MAS may involve an increase in the

ARTICLE 4 - PAYMENTS
- --------------------

4.1  MAS shall make available a sum of USD1,000,000 (UNITED STATES DOLLARS ONE

     charter of the Aircraft for the 1993 Haj program.  Such deposit shall be
     wire-transferred to the account of WORLD with American Security Bank,
     Washington, D.C. United States of America, ABA No. 054000551, Account No.
     86712080 for credit to World Airways Account. This deposit shall constitute
     and form part of the total cost of this Agreement. Such deposit shall be

     impractical to calculate a party's actual damages resulting from
     unjustifiable cancellation by the other party and the above sum is a
     reasonable estimate of such damages and is agreed to as liquidated damages
     and is not a penalty.

     five (5) days after WORLD notifies MAS of such failure or (ii) upon
     termination of this Agreement pursuant to Article 19.2.

4.4  All bank charges associated with the administrative cost of the Letter of
     Credit referred to in Article 4.3, shall be borne by WORLD.

4.5  Upon completion or each rotation an invoice will be presented to MAS for

     Number 86712080 with American Security Bank, Washington, D.C. United States
     of America, ABA No. 054000551.

     exceeds 36 (Thirty Six) hours, then Article 9.2 shall apply.

9.2  Subject always to the conditions set out herein, in the event that the
     Aircraft is not available for operation hereunder, WORLD shall use its
     reasonable efforts to substitute another aircraft with the same or similar
     configuration capable of accommodating 364 (Three Hundred and Sixty Four)
     passengers and their baggage in the case of a DC10-30 aircraft and 383
     (Three Hundred and Eighty Three) passengers in the case of a MD11 aircraft.
     In the event of such substitution, reference to "The Aircraft" in this
     Agreement shall be read and construed as reference to the substitute
     aircraft. In addition, WORLD shall have the right to provide MAS substitute
     service for any charter flight with another air carrier's service because
     of operational requirements provided that the substitute aircraft conforms
     to the conditions of this Article. If the Aircraft shall be unable to
     depart at the scheduled time on any flight due to its unserviceability for
     any reasons whatsoever (except those attributable to the negligent act or
     omission of MAS), WORLD shall, in the case of the Aircraft being
     unserviceable have 36 (thirty-six) hours from the scheduled time of
     departure within which to rectify such unserviceability.
<PAGE>
 
                                       23

     During this period of unserviceability and until such time as the Aircraft
     is ready to resume its programmed operations, MAS will be freed of its
     contractual guarantee of operating the planned hours during such period of
     unserviceability, and the guarantee of 3,133 block hours shall be reduced
     by the number of planned block hours unflown by WORLD during the period of
     unserviceability, provided, however, that such hours not actually flown by
     WORLD shall be flown by MAS using its own aircraft or by another air
     carrier on MAS's behalf. In the event that WORLD shall be unable to rectify
     such unserviceability within 36 (thirty-six) hours, MAS shall be entitled
     to make other arrangements for the carriage of the passengers as required
     without payments of any cancellation fees.

ARTICLE 14 - CANCELLATION
- -------------------------

14.1 It is understood and agreed between WORLD and MAS that it would be
     impossible or impractical to calculate WORLD's damages in the event MAS
     failed to meet the minimum block hour guarantee specified in Article 3.9.
     In the event MAS is unable to meet the guaranteed minimum of 3,133 block
     hours as a result of cancellation of any flight, MAS shall pay to WORLD
     USD6,566.67 (UNITED STATES DOLLARS SIX THOUSAND FIVE HUNDRED AND SIXTY SIX
     AND CENTS SIXTY SEVEN) per block hour for each block hour remaining unflown
     short of the minimum number of 3,133 guaranteed block hours.  This charge
     is a reasonable estimate of WORLD's damages and is agreed to as liquidated
     damages and is not a penalty. This Article 14 shall not apply under the
     circumstances specified in Article 9 and Article 13.

14.2 If WORLD is unable to perform any charter flight or sector thereof, or
     service contemplated by this Agreement for the reasons set forth in Article
     13 hereof, WORLD shall be under no obligation or liability to MAS except to
     refund the deposit or other portion of the charter price paid for that
     charter flight or sector or service.

     Airlift Emergency as determined by the U.S. Secretary of Defence or his
     designee or in the event of an Airlift Emergency or National Emergency
     determined by the President of the United States, or if the U.S. Civil
     Reserve Air Fleet is activated by order of the U.S. Secretary of Defence.
     If in any of these cases such Aircraft is required, WORLD shall exercise
     this right of termination by telegraphic notice to MAS. In the event this
     Agreement is so terminated, MAS' duty to pay rent hereunder with respect to
     such Aircraft shall cease and abate from the time MAS is deprived of the
     beneficial use of such Aircraft.

     any liabilities and claims, demands, suits, judgements, damages and losses
     of whatsoever nature including the costs, expenses and reasonable legal
     fees connected therewith or incident thereto, arising out of or in any way

     duly authorised representatives of both WORLD and MAS.  The failure of

                    AIR CARRIER'S STANDARD SECURITY PROGRAM
                    ---------------------------------------

I.   PURPOSE AND APPLICABILITY
     -------------------------

     A.   Purpose. The purpose of this security program is to prevent or deter
          -------                                                             
          aircraft hijacking, sabotage and related criminal acts. This program
          is required by FAR Part 108 and describes the security procedures and
          facilities related to:

          1.   The screening of all passengers and other persons and all
               property intended to be carried in the cabin of airplanes or into
               a sterile area by weapons detecting procedures or facilities as
               described herein to prevent or deter the carriage of any
               explosive, incendiary device or other deadly or dangerous weapon
               aboard airplanes or into a sterile area.

          2.   Assuring that only persons authorised are permitted to have
               access to their firearms while aboard its airplanes or in a
               sterile area under the air carrier's control.

          3.   Controlling air carrier's facilities and operations areas to
               prevent or deter unauthorized access to such areas and to
               airplanes.

          4.   Accepting baggage and cargo.
<PAGE>
 
                                       45

          5.   Controlling access to baggage and cargo intended for carriage
               aboard airplanes.

          6.   Responding to threats considered to be against specific 
               airplanes.

          7.   Assuring that the screening of all persons affords for uniform,
               courteous, and efficient treatment to the maximum extent
               practicable.

B.   Applicability. This program is applicable to scheduled and public charter
     -------------                                                            
     operations(s) conducted by the air carrier as follows:

          1.   61 seats and above. All Sections and Appendices applicable except
               Section XVI.

          2.   1 through 60 seats where access to sterile area is desired. All
               Sections and Appendices applicable except Section XVI. Section XV
               lists special procedures applicable to this category of
               operations.

          3.   31 through 60 seats not requiring access to sterile areas.
               Applicable Sections include II.C.1, X, XI, XVI and other
               Sections as appropriate.

          4.   1 through 30 seats not requiring access to sterile area. No
               Sections or Appendices applicable unless air carrier
               voluntarily seeks FAA approval of program. In that case,
               Section XV identifies applicable Sections.

     NOTE :    Although certain airplane operations of the air carrier may not
               be required to be conducted pursuant to this program, all such
               operations are required to be conducted in conformance with the
               requirements contained in FAR Sections 108.11(b)-(e), 108.19 and
               108.23.

II.  SCREENING RESPONSIBILITIES AND PROCEDURES
     -----------------------------------------

     A.   Responsibilities. The air carrier is responsible for the inspection
          ----------------                                                  
          which constitutes screening of persons and hand-carried (carry-on)
          items. Air carrier personnel or outside agency personnel contracted by
          the air carrier(s) shall perform the screening. Guidelines pertaining
          to these functions are contained in appendices to this program.

     B.   Persons. All persons desiring to pass beyond the screening point or
          -------                                                            
          board an airplane must undergo screening. Screening of persons is
          normally accomplished through the use of metal detectors. Individuals
          are not permitted to retain any hand-carried items in their possession
          during screening other than articles of clothing and very small or
          thin objects such as boarding passes or tickets. All indications of
          unaccounted-for metal on an individual's person must be satisfactorily
          resolved. Only upon satisfactory completion of screening and of the
          inspection of all hand-carried items may the individual be permitted
          to pass beyond the screening point.
<PAGE>
 
                                       47

     1.   If a person alarms the metal detection device, a determination must be
          made that the cause of this alarm is not a weapon or dangerous object.
          This can be accomplished by a hand-held metal detector, by asking the
          individual to remove extraneous metal from his or her person and
          repassing through the walk-through detector, or by a consent search of
          the person conducted by a representative of the air carrier. Persons
          who cannot be cleared by the air carrier using any combination of
          these procedures will be referred to the law enforcement officer.

     2.   Every person has the option to refuse screening or to request a
          physical body search in lieu of metal detector screening. Persons who
          refuse to be screened will be denied passage beyond the screening
          point.

     3.   A consent search of the person shall be conducted by persons of the
          same sex as that of the person being screened, unless the person being
          screened agrees otherwise. Guidelines pertaining to the screening of
          persons appear in Appendices to this program.

                                       48

     C.   Hand-Carried (Carry-on) Items. All carry-on items passing through the
          -----------------------------                                        
          screening point or being carried aboard an airplane shall be screened.
          Normally, this screening is accomplished by physical search or X-ray
          inspection. The inspection should be thorough but not unreasonable.
          Items cleared by this inspection may pass the screening point and be
          carried into the airplane cabin. Should a person refuse to permit
          inspection of any hand-carried item, such item shall not be allowed to
          pass the screening point or be allowed to be carried into the airplane
          cabin.

          1.   When the physical inspection method is used, all carry-on items
               shall be adequately inspected to reasonably ascertain that such
               items are not being used to conceal an explosive, incendiary, or
               deadly or dangerous weapon.  Guidelines pertaining to the
               inspection of carry-on items appear in Appendices to this
               program.

          2.   The X-ray inspection method requires the use of an adequately
               trained operator.  Whenever the operator sees on the display an
               image that is or may conceal an explosive, incendiary, or deadly
               or dangerous weapon, the hand-carried item must then undergo
               physical search.

     D.   Private Screening.
          ----------------- 

          a.   The air carrier may conduct private screening provided the person
               is then escorted into a sterile area or to the airplane.

          b.   Private screening shall not be routinely conducted, but may be
               used at the discretion of the air carrier and/or upon the request
               of the passenger when normal screening procedures are
               inappropriate.

          c.   Private screening procedures used by the air carrier shall be
               consistent with the purpose of this program to screen all
               passengers and all property intended to be carried in the cabin
               of the airplane.

     E.   Screening of Handicapped Persons.
          -------------------------------- 

          Persons on crutches, in wheelchairs or in stretchers, or wearing
          prosthetic aids, etc., may be privately screened. With reason and
          discretion, the person conducting the screening or consent search
          using either a hand-held metal detection device or a physical search
          or combination of both, shall assure that no weapons or dangerous
          objects are on or about the person being screened. The person shall
          then be escorted through or around the screening point.  Hand-carried
          items shall be screened in the normal manner.

                                       50

     F.   Charter Flights.  On public charter flights, as defined in FAR Section
          ---------------                                                       
          108.3, for which screening is required, all persons shall be screened
          in the same manner as persons travelling on scheduled flights.  Upon
          request of the principal security inspector (PSI), the air carrier
          shall furnish a current list of known public charters to include the
          planned dates, times, and departure points of the flights. Private
          charter passengers having been screened by virtue of affinity and
          other existing safeguards may deplane into sterile areas without
          further screening or escort.  However, when an air carrier becomes
          aware that a person on a private charter flight is in the possession
          of a deadly or dangerous weapon and is not authorized pursuant to FAR
          Section 108.11, the air carrier shall deny that person unescorted
          access to any sterile area, air operations area, or nonpublic area and
          shall report the situation to a law enforcement officer if deemed
          appropriate.

                         PHYSICAL INSPECTION GUIDELINES
                         ------------------------------

1.   General.  Below are guidelines for physical inspection. Of course, the best
     -------                                                                    
     guideline of all is common sense and caution.

     a.   In the whole approach to the screening process, good judgment should
          prevail. For example, a pair of dressmaker scissors with other items
          indicating a hobby of sewing carried by a lady would probably result
          in a decision permitting her to carry the scissors. The same scissors
          carried by a man or without other sewing items might be reason to
          restrict carriage. Other devices or objects even though not commonly
          thought of as dangerous objects, e.g., tools, knitting needles,
          elongated scissors and the like, when carried by an individual who
          does not obviously have a need for such items, may be questionable or
          may be treated as dangerous objects.

     b.   Likewise, search of luggage also requires common sense and
          organisation. First, all sections of a bag, whether zipper
          compartments, including shaving kits, etc., must be opened and
          inspected. Second, work in an organised manner so you know precisely
          what you have inspected.  Remember that weapons generally have common
          characteristics. They weigh more than clothing.  They tend to fall to
          the lowest portion of a bag when disturbed, and they are solid or
          rigid.  Good hiding places are rolled clothing, including socks, and
          cases designed for other items such as cameras, etc.
<PAGE>
 
                                       52

     c.   Within the context of a reasonable search, a garment draped over the
          shoulders or hand-carried in a manner which does not appear likely to
          conceal a nonmetallic dangerous device, e.g., an explosive or
          flammable liquid, could be inspected by the passenger's wearing or
          carrying it through the metal detector. If a garment is "bunched up"
          or appears to be wrapped around something, a physical or x-ray
          inspection would be required. Similarly, magazines and newspapers can
          be screened by the metal detector providing they do not appear to be
          concealing some nonmetallic dangerous object. Some very small or thin
          objects, e.g., boarding passes or tickets, can be screened by simple
          visual observation or by passage through the metal detector.

     d.   The minute search and opening of pillboxes, medicines, small religious
          articles, small notebooks and letters and the like, should not
          normally be necessary.  If there is no evidence of tampering and the
          items are obviously that which they appear to be, they should not
          require opening.

2.   Special Items.  Certain items have a greater potential for concealment or
     -------------                                                            
     pose special search problems.  They are detailed in the following section:

     a.   Containers such as wrapped packages, boxes, and shaving kits packed in
          carry-on luggage could contain a weapon or dangerous object.  Each one
          should be opened for inspection.
<PAGE>
 
                                       53

     b.   Thick layers of packed clothing can be checked by running the hands
          between the layers.  Pat or feel rolled up soiled clothing.

     c.   Garment bags need careful checking. A weapon might be suspended from
          the hangar or lying in a lower corner.

     d.   Umbrellas should be slightly opened to ensure they do not contain
          weapons.  Likewise slightly turn their handles to see if they are
          rigid. If not, the handle itself could be a knife.

     e.   Attache cases and small suitcases should be examined to assure that
          there is no false bottom or concealed compartments.  This can be
          accomplished by observing or feeling the bottom and sides to determine
          that they have normal thickness. Be suspicious of any interior that
          looks unprofessional or repaired.

     f.   Stuffed pillows and toys are particularly difficult to inspect. The
          stuffing could prevent you from feeling a concealed weapon.  Rely
          primarily on the weight material and any gun or explosive hidden
          within would normally make the toy unusually heavy.

     g.   Cigarette cartons, cigar boxes and other tobacco containers are also
          light weight items.  They can be inspected by holding to determine
          that the weight is consistent with what is normally expected as well
          as to open the container and visually check contents.

                                       54

     h.   Even shoes have been used to conceal weapons or explosive devices.
          The inspection of shoes must include the removal of shoe trees to
          ascertain that nothing is concealed in the toe of the shoe.

     i.   Aerosol cans should be inspected by holding them so as to determine
          that the weight is consistent with what is normally expected.  In
          addition, squeeze the can; one that has been tampered with and no
          longer pressurised will dent very easily.  If the can is suspicious in
          any way, it must be cleared of suspicion before being transported.

     j.   Cameras, or photography equipment, should be visually inspected to
          determine that the lens is intact and that there are no suspicious
          apertures which might conceal the muzzle of a customised firearm.

     k.   All portable electrical devices such as tape recorders, dictaphones,
          and phonographs should also be visually inspected to determine if
          there are any unusual apertures and if the batteries are in place.
          Most can be operated as proof they have not been tampered with.

     l.   Books should be inspected to determine that they have not been altered
          to conceal a dangerous object.

                               Amendment No. 1

        This Amendment No. 1, dated May 14, 1993, between World Airways, Inc. 
a Delaware corporation, and Federal Express Corporation, a Delaware 
corporation, as successor in interest to the Connecticut National Bank, as 
lessor.

        WHEREAS, the parties (or their predecessors in interest) are party to 
a Lease Agreement, dated as of March 30, 1987 (the "Lease"), recorded with the
Federal Aviation Authority on __________, 1987 at ________ and desire to amend
certain of the terms thereof;

        WHEREAS, terms used herein without definition are used as defined in 
the Lease.

        NOW, THEREFORE, the parties agree as follows:

        1. Extension. The Lease is hereby extended until July 10, 1994 for one
           ---------
Aircraft, a date selected at the Lessee's discretion between July 10 and 
August 15, 1994 for one Aircraft and one Spare Engine and a date selected at 
the Lessee's discretion between September 1 and September 19, 1994 for the 
third Aircraft and the second Spare Engine (each such date a "Return Date"); 
provided that the first Spare Engine need not be returned on such schedule if 
at that time it is undergoing repair or overhaul and instead shall be returned
when such repair and/or overhaul are completed. The Lessee shall decide in its
sole discretion which Aircraft and which Spare Engine is returned at which 
Return Date, except that the Aircraft N106WA may not be delivered on the third
Return Date. The Lessee shall notify the Lessor at least 90 days before each 
Return Date as to which Aircraft and, if applicable, which Spare Engine will 
be returned on such Return Date and, in the case of the second and third 
Return Date, on precisely what day the Return Date will be.

        2. Stipulated Loss Value. The Stipulated Loss Value for the Aircraft
           ----------------------
during the extension shall continue in the same pattern as set forth on Exhibit
B to the Lease, i.e. the Stipulated Loss Value percentage shall reduce by .09%
on each Basic Rent payment date.

        3. Return. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in the Lease,
           ------

        (a) each cargo loading system (including the net and smoke barrier)
shall be returned with its related Aircraft, but will not be installed on such
Aircraft;

        (b) all passenger-related equipment not required for operation of an 
Aircraft as a freighter shall be removed by the Lessee from each Aircraft 
prior to its return and shall be retained by the Lessee without any 
compensation therefore, provided that this clause (b) is contingent on 
McDonnell Douglas Corporation granting its consent thereto, and the parties 
agree to diligently attempt to obtain such consent;
 




<PAGE>
 
     (c) all returns shall take place anywhere on the route structure of 
Federal Express Corporation as selected mutually by the parties hereto, or 
such other place as the parties mutually agree;

     (d) At the time of their return no more than seven Engines and Spare 
Engines shall have accumulated more than 900 Cycles per Engine or Spare Engine
since its last heavy maintenance visit.

     (e) each Aircraft need not be fresh out of a "C" check at its return, 
provided that the Lessee shall pay to the Lessor for each of the first and 
last Aircraft to be returned $300,000 at their return provided that the Lessor
shall first withdraw from the "C" check Maintenance Reserve Payments to 
satisfy this payment obligation, any shortfall shall be paid by the Lessee and
any overage remaining from such Reserve Payments shall be paid by the Lessor 
to the Lessee. In the event Lessee returns an Aircraft with an FAA extension 
for "C" check, Lessor agrees to accept such Aircraft without any additional 
compensation or work other than as set forth in this paragraph;

     (f) Sections 12(b)(ii) and 12(d) of the Lease shall be applicable on 
April 1, 1994 even though no returns are occurring on such date;

     (g) A new Section 12(i) is added as follows:

     "(i) Return of Engines: Off-Wing Maintenance. The Lessee shall pay to the
          ----------------------------------------
Lessor the product of $150.00 and the number of Flight Hours incurred by such 
Engine or Spare Engine since April 1, 1994. Such payments shall be made on the
10th day of each month regarding usage during the prior month. Notwithstanding
anything in this Lease to the contrary, in the event for any reason any Engine
or Spare Engine needs any off-wing repair, maintenance, overhaul, modification
(if such modification is required by this Lease) or other work done to it 
("Off-Wing Work"), the Lessee shall notify the Lessor thereof as soon as 
practical and the Lessor shall arrange for such Off-Wing Work to be done as 
promptly as practical and solely at the expense and risk of the Lessor, 
including shipping costs. The Lessor shall have no responsibility to replace 
such Engine or Spare Engine, however, while it is undergoing such Off-Wing 
Work. The Lessee shall remain solely responsible for any repair, maintenance, 
overhaul, or modification required by this Lease which can be done while the 
Engine or Spare Engine is installed on an Aircraft or aircraft."

     (h) No payments shall be due under Section 5(e)(iii) of the Lease on 
account of Flight Hours or Cycles accumulated after March 31, 1994 and none of
the payments previously made under said Section shall be used by the Lessor to
perform its obligations under Section 12(i) of the Lease.

     (i) Section 12(c) of the Lease is rewritten as follows: (c) 
Overhaul-Airframe. In the event that Lessee does not meet the conditions in
- ----------------- 
clause (i)(1) of Paragraph (b) of this Article with respect to an Airframe, 
Lessee shall pay Lessor the product of $60 multiplied by the number of Flight 
Hours accumulated by such Airframe over 50% of the allowable Flight Hours 
between Airframe overhauls, major block maintenance or "D" check, whichever 
shall
<PAGE>
 
then apply. Lessor shall satisfy this obligation first by utilizing the 
Maintenance Reserve for the Airframe and any shortfall shall be paid by 
Lessee.

          3. CRAF. (a) The parties acknowledge that Lessee may commit the 
             ----
Aircraft to the U.S. Civil Reserve Air Fleet for Stage I, II and III for the 
fiscal year ending September 30, 1994 (as such period may be extended at the 
option of the U.S. Government (the "Government")) (such potential commitment 
period is known as the "Call-up Period") and therefore agree that, 
notwithstanding anything to the contrary in the Lease, in the event of a Civil
Reserve Fleet Mobilization (a "Mobilization") during the Lease Term, as 
extended above, during which the Government requires Lessee to provide airlift
services which requires the services of an Aircraft, the Lease of such 
Aircraft shall continue in effect until the later of the scheduled expiration 
of the Lease, as so extended, or the date such Aircraft is returned by the 
Government to Lessee. If such Aircraft is returned by the Government to Lessee
after the scheduled expiration of the Lease for such Aircraft, Lessee will 
return such Aircraft to the Lessor in accordance with the terms of the Lease as
promptly as practical after such Aircraft is returned by the Government to 
Lessee.

          (b) In the event that an Aircraft is so required by the Government 
under its contract with Lessee at any time after the end of the Lease Term for
such Aircraft, but not later than the end of the Call-up Period, Lessee shall 
immediately dispatch notice to the Lessor advising it of the Mobilization and 
specifying the Aircraft required in order to satisfy the requirements of the 
Mobilization, and Lessor, subject to causes beyond Lessor's control and 
without its fault or negligence, shall within 24 hours of receipt of such 
notice for aircraft called up for CRAF Stages I and II and 48 hours of receipt
of such notice for aircraft called up for CRAF Stage III, or such additional 
time as the Government may permit, position and deliver the specified Aircraft
and the required flight crews and material as required by the Government. The 
Lease to Lessee shall be deemed in effect for the entire call up period for 
such Aircraft.

          Lessee agrees that, in the event of a Mobilization, it will exercise
its best reasonable efforts to utilize other DC-10 aircraft then in its fleet 
to perform its airlift obligations under its contracts with the Government 
before requiring Lessor to deliver the Aircraft under this Section 3(b); 
provided, however, that nothing in this paragraph shall abridge Lessee's right
to require Lessor to deliver an Aircraft to it if, as directed by the 
Government, such Aircraft is required for the performance of airlift services 
required under Lessee's CRAF contracts.

          The parties agree that they shall from time to time do and perform 
such other and further acts as may be reasonably requested by the other party 
in order to carry out and effect the intent and purpose of this Section 3. 
Lessor will not take any action with respect to the Aircraft during the 
Call-up Period which would violate the terms of the standard CRAF contract for
fiscal year 1994.

          (c) Notwithstanding anything in the Lease to the contrary, no Event 
of Default shall be deemed to occur during a Mobilization of an Aircraft if 
such Event of Default cannot be cured by Lessee as a result of such 
Mobilization, provided that, upon return of such Aircraft by the Government to
Lessee, Lessee cures such Event of Default as promptly as practical.


<PAGE>
 
        (d)  While the Lease is in effect pursuant to Section 3(b), Lessee and
Lessor agree that Lessor shall perform such airlift services as the Government
may direct during the Mobilization, and shall adhere to and be bound by the 
standards, procedures and requirements under Lessee's CRAF contract with the 
Government and shall perform Lessee's obligations, and have the exclusive 
right to exercise Lessee's rights, under the Lease (except that (x) Lessor 
shall cause any public liability insurance carried by it (or any substitute 
protection pursuant to Section 8(c) of the Lease) to name Lessee as an 
additional insured and (y) during such reinstatement period Sections 10, 
15(c), and 16(a), (k), (l) and (m) shall not apply) and for such purpose 
Lessee will permit Lessor to have complete control and possession of the 
Aircraft subject to the Mobilization. All sums received by Lessee with respect
to such Aircraft resulting from its actual Mobilization shall be paid to 
Lessor promptly after receipt, after deducting therefrom a commission equal to
1.0% of the amounts actually received by Lessee, which commission shall be 
retained by Lessee. Any failure of Lessor to satisfy Lessee's obligations 
under the Lease during such call up period shall be deemed excused to the 
extent Lessor has excused Lessee from such obligations.

        In the event of a Mobilization of an Aircraft pursuant to Section 3(b),
the parties agree to negotiate in good faith (i) amendments to this Amendment 
to effectuate the intent of this Section 3, subject to the requirements of 
CRAF, (ii) an allocation of the risks covered by Sections 15(a) and (b) of the
Lease between Lessee and Lessor in a manner consistent with the other 
provisions of this Section 3 and (iii) to determine which Sections of the 
Lease shall not apply during such Mobilization in addition to those specified 
in the last parenthetical of the preceding paragraph (the references to such 
Sections not being deemed in any way a presumption that other Sections in the 
Lease should apply during a Mobilization).

        Lessee agrees to provide to Lessor a copy of its CRAF contracts that 
relate to the Aircraft promptly after the execution thereof.

        4.  Miscellaneous. Except as amended hereby, the Lease is ratified and
            -------------
confirmed in all respects. This Amendment may be signed in any number of 
counterparts, each of which is an original, but all of which constitute one 
and the same instrument.
<PAGE>
 
   IN WITNESS WHEREOF, the parties have caused this Amendment No. 1 to have 
been duly executed and delivered on the date first above written.

Federal Express Corporation as selected mutually by the parties hereto, or 
such other place as the parties mutually agree;

    (d) At the time of their return no more than seven Engines and Spare 
Engines shall have accumulated more than 900 Cycles per Engine or Spare Engine
since its last heavy maintenance visit.

    (e) each Aircraft need not be fresh out of a "C" check at its return, 
provided that the Lessee shall pay to the Lessor for each of the first and 
last Aircraft to be returned $300,000 at their return provided that the Lessor
shall first withdraw from the "C" check Maintenance Reserve Payments to 
satisfy this payment obligation, any shortfall shall be paid by the Lessee and
any overage remaining from such Reserve Payments shall be paid by the Lessor 
to the Lessee. In the event Lessee returns an Aircraft with an FAA extension 
for "C" check, Lessor agrees to accept such Aircraft without any additional 
compensation or work other than as set forth in this paragraph;

    (f) Sections 12(b)(ii) and 12(d) of the Lease shall be applicable on April
1, 1994 even though no returns are occurring on such date;

    (g) A new Section 12(i) is added as follows:

    "(i) Return of Engines; Off-Wing Maintenance. The lessee shall pay to the
         ---------------------------------------   
Lessor the product of $150.00 and the number of Flight Hours incurred by such 
Engine or Spare Engine since April 1, 1994. Such payments shall be made on the  
10th day of each month regarding usage during the prior month. Notwithstanding 
anything in this Lease to the contrary, in the event for any reason any Engine
or Spare Engine needs any off-wing repair, maintenance, overhaul, modification
(if such modification is required by this Lease) or other work done to it 
("Off-Wing Work"), the Lessee shall notify the Lessor thereof as soon as 
practical and the Lessor shall arrange for such Off-Wing Work to be done as 
promptly as practical and solely at the expense and risk of the Lessor, 
including shipping costs. The Lessor shall have no responsibility to replace 
such Engine or Spare Engine, however, while it is undergoing such Off-Wing 
Work. The Lessee shall remain solely responsible for any repair, maintenance, 
overhaul, or modification required by this Lease which can be done while the 
Engine or Spare Engine is installed on an Aircraft or aircraft."

    (h) No payments shall be due under Section 5(e)(iii) of the Lease on 
account of Flight Hours or Cycles accumulated after March 31, 1994 and none of
the payments previously made under said Section shall be used by the Lessor to
perform its obligations under Section 12(i) of the Lease.
<PAGE>
 
    (i) Section 12(c) of the Lease is rewritten as follows: (c) 
Overhaul-Airframe. In the event that Lessee does not meet the conditions in 
- ------------------
clause (i)(1) of Paragraph (b) of this Article with respect to an Airframe, 
Lessee shall pay Lessor the product of $60 multiplied by the number of Flight 
Hours accumulated by such Airframe over 50% of the allowable Flight Hours 
between Airframe overhauls, major block maintenance or "D" check, whichever 
shall then apply. Lessor shall satisfy this obligation first by utilizing the 
Maintenance Reserve for the Airframe and any shortfall shall be paid by 
Lessee.

    3. CRAF. (a) The parties acknowledge that Lessee may commit the Aircraft 
       ----
to the U.S. Civil Reserve Air Fleet for Stage I, II and III for the fiscal 
year ending September 30, 1994 (as such period may be extended at the option of
the U.S. Government (the "Government")) (such potential commitment period is 
known as the "Call-up Period") and therefore agree that, notwithstanding 
anything to the contrary in the Lease, in the event of a Civil Reserve Fleet 
Mobilization (a "Mobilization") during the Lease Term, as extended above, 
during which the Government requires Lessee to provide airlift services which 
requires the services of an Aircraft, the Lease of such Aircraft shall 
continue in effect until the later of the scheduled expiration of the Lease, as
so extended, or the date such Aircraft is returned by the Government to Lessee.
If such Aircraft is returned by the Government to Lessee after the scheduled 
expiration of the Lease for such Aircraft, Lessee will return such Aircraft to 
the Lessor in accordance with the terms of the Lease as promptly as practical 
after such Aircraft is returned by the Government to Lessee.

    (b) In the event that an Aircraft is so required by the Government under 
its contract with Lessee at any time after the end of the Lease Term for such 
Aircraft, but not later than the end of the Call-up Period, Lessee shall 
immediately dispatch notice to the Lessor advising it of the Mobilization and 
specifying the Aircraft required in order to satisfy the requirements of the 
Mobilization, and Lessor, subject to causes beyond Lessor's control and 
without its fault or negligence, shall within 24 hours of receipt of such 
notice for aircraft called up for CRAF Stages I and II and 48 hours of receipt
of such notice for aircraft called up for CRAF Stage III, or such additional 
time as the Government may permit, position and deliver the specified Aircraft
and the required flight crews and material as required by the Government. The 
Lease to Lessee shall be deemed in effect for the entire call up period for 
such Aircraft.

    Lessee agrees that, in the event of a Mobilization, it will exercise its 
best reasonable efforts to utilize other DC-10 aircraft then in its fleet to 
perform its airlift obligations under its contracts with the Government before
requiring Lessor to deliver the Aircraft under this Section 3(b); provided, 
however, that nothing in this paragraph shall abridge Lessee's right to require
Lessor to deliver an Aircraft to it if, as directed by the Government, such 
Aircraft is required for the performance of airlift services required under 
Lessee's CRAF contracts.

    The parties agree that they shall from time to time do and perform such 
other and further acts as may be reasonably requested by the other party in 
order to carry out and effect the intent and purpose of this Section 3. 
Lessor will not take any action with respect
<PAGE>
 
to the Aircraft during the Call-up Period which would violate the terms of the
standard CRAF contract for fiscal year 1994.

        (c)  Notwithstanding anything in the Lease to the contrary, no Event 
of Default shall be deemed to occur during a Mobilization of an Aircraft if 
such Event of Default cannot be cured by Lessee as a result of such 
Mobilization, provided that, upon return of such Aircraft by the Government to
Lessee, Lessee cures such Event of Default as promptly as practical.

        (d)  While the Lease is in effect pursuant to Section 3(b), Lessee and
Lessor agree that Lessor shall perform such airlift services as the Government
may direct during the Mobilization, and shall adhere to and be bound by the 
standards, procedures and requirements under Lessee's CRAF contract with the 
Government and shall perform Lessee's obligations, and have the exclusive 
right to exercise Lessee's rights, under the Lease (except that (x) Lessor 
shall cause any public liability insurance carried by it (or any substitute
protection pursuant to Section 8(c) of the Lease) to name Lessee as an
additional insured and (y) during such reinstatement period Sections 10,
15(c), and 16(a), (k), (l) and (m) shall not apply) and for such purpose
Lessee will permit Lessor to have complete control and possession of the
Aircraft subject to the Mobilization. All sums received by Lessee with respect
to such Aircraft resulting from its actual Mobilization shall be paid to
Lessor promptly after receipt, after deducting therefrom a commission equal to
1.0% of the amounts actually received by Lessee, which commission shall be
retained by Lessee. Any failure of Lessor to satisfy Lessee's obligations
under the Lease during such call up period shall be deemed excused to the
extent Lessor has excused Lessee from such obligations.

        In the event of a Mobilization of an Aircraft pursuant to Section 3(b),
the parties agree to negotiate in good faith (i) amendments to this Amendment 
to effectuate the intent of this Section 3, subject to the requirements of 
CRAF, (ii) an allocation of the risks covered by Sections 15(a) and (b) of the
Lease between Lessee and Lessor in a manner consistent with the other 
provisions of this Section 3 and (iii) to determine which Sections of the 
Lease shall not apply during such Mobilization in addition to those specified 
in the last parenthetical of the preceding paragraph (the references to such 
Sections not being deemed in any way a presumption that other Sections in the 
Lease should apply during a Mobilization).

        Lessee agrees to provide to Lessor a copy of its CRAF contracts that 
relate to the Aircraft promptly after the execution thereof.

        4.  Miscellaneous.  Except as amended hereby, the Lease is ratified 
            -------------
and confirmed in all respects. This Amendment may be signed in any number of 
counterparts, each of which is an original, but all of which constitute one 
and the same instrument.

                                  AGREEMENT

     This Agreement is made and entered into as of the 9th day of July, 1993, 
by and among World Airways, Inc. ("World"), WorldCorp Inc. ("WorldCorp"), 
International Lease Finance Corporation ("ILFC"), McDonnell Douglas 
Corporation ("MDC") and McDonnell Douglas Finance Corporation ("MDFC").

                                  Recitals
                                  --------

A.  World is presently leasing from MDFC two DC-10-30 aircraft bearing FAA
    registration numbers N114WA and N115WA, respectively (collectively, the
    "DC-10 Aircraft" and, individually, an "Aircraft"), under separate lease
    agreements (collectively, the "Leases" and, individually, a "Lease"), each
    dated as of February 12, 1992, guarantied by WorldCorp.

B.  Pursuant to, and subject to the terms and conditions of, Purchase
    Agreement DAC 88-43-D, as amended (the "Purchase Agreement"), ILFC has
    purchased or will purchase from MDC six MD-11 aircraft for which firm
    orders have been placed as of the date hereof, that ILFC intends to lease
    to World (the "MD-11 Aircraft").

C.  In order to facilitate the purchase of the MD-11 Aircraft and the lease
    thereof to World, and for other good and valuable consideration, the
    parties desire to enter into the agreement hereinafter set forth.

                                  Agreement
                                  ---------

1.  Assignment and Assumption of the Leases. (the assignment dates hereinafter
    ---------------------------------------
referred to, with respect to each Lease, as the "Effective Date"), and MDC 
shall assume all of World's obligations thereunder. Concurrently with the 
assignment to and assumption by MDC of the Leases, (a) World shall be released
from all of its obligations arising thereunder on and after the Effective Date
(the "Assumed Obligations") and (b) WorldCorp shall be released from its 
obligations arising under its guaranties of the Leases on account of the 
Assumed Obligations (but the guaranties shall continue in full force and 
effect with respect to the obligations of World arising under the Leases 
through the Effective Date).

2.  Consent of MDFC.  Subject to the terms of Section 3 of this Agreement, 
    ---------------
MDFC shall consent to the assignment and assumption of the Leases and the 
releases effected by Section 1 hereof.

3.  Conditions. The obligations of MDC and MDFC under this 
    ----------

<PAGE>
 
(a) No default in the payment of Basic Rent and no Event of Default (as such 
capitalized terms are defined in the Leases) shall have occurred and be 
continuing under the Leases, in each case as of the Effective Date, (b) or 
cause to be delivered, the DC-10 Aircraft to MDC in Long Beach, California or 
at such other location (or locations) as MDC and World may agree, and (c) if 
MDC and World are unable to agree upon the amount of the Deposit or upon 
whether such return conditions have been satisfied by July 15, 1993, with 
respect to the N114WA Aircraft, or by July 24, 1993, with respect to the N115WA 
Aircraft, then MDC and World shall mutually select an independent third party 
who shall determine the amount of the Deposit and/or the compliance with such 
return conditions. The determination of such third party shall be final and 
binding. World shall make the Aircraft available for inspection by MDC upon 
reasonable notice, as agreed, prior to the Effective Date. MDC shall use 
reasonable efforts to minimize the expense of such maintenance or repairs.

4.   Payment Covenants.  MDC acknowledges that ILFC paid to MDC the amount of 
     -----------------
$2,500,000 on or before April 1, 1993. World shall pay to MDC the amount of 
$750,000 on or before the Effective Date with respect to the N114WA 
Aircraft, and $750,000 on or before the Effective Date with respect to the 
N115WA Aircraft, provided MDC and MDFC have certified to World that all the 
conditions in the preceding section, except satisfaction of the return 
conditions and payment of the Deposit, if not settled, have either been 
satisfied or waived with respect to such Aircraft, and shall pay on demand by 
MDC a sum equal to any shortfall between the Deposit and the actual expense of
the work required to return such Aircraft to the Agreed Condition, with any 
excess of the Deposit over such expense to be returned to World with interest 
at MDC's overnight borrowing rate. If the conditions contained in Section 3 
hereof have not been satisfied by World or waived by MDC and MDFC by the 
Effective Date, then the parties hereto will negotiate in good faith to 
resolve their differences. Failing such resolution, MDC shall return to ILFC, 
within twenty days after the second Effective Date, the sum of $2,500,000 
theretofore paid by ILFC, with interest from April 1, 1993 at MDC's overnight 
borrowing rate.

5.   Subleases of the Aircraft.  MDC shall use reasonable efforts to cause 
     -------------------------
each of the DC-10 Aircraft to be and remain at all times subleased or subject 
to a New Lease (as such term is hereinafter defined), and ILFC and World shall
cooperate in such efforts, during the original scheduled term of the Lease of 
the Aircraft.

                                      2
<PAGE>
 
MDC shall offer and recommend the DC-10 Aircraft to prospective operators 
before other DC-10 aircraft being marketed by MDC, but MDC shall not be 
obligated to withhold such other DC-10 aircraft from the market should an 
operator express an interest in such other aircraft. The standard of care by 
which MDC's (or if a sublease is converted to a New Lease, MDFC's) fulfillment
of its obligations under the two preceding sentences shall be judged is: MDC 
(or MDFC) shall make all decisions regarding the DC-10 Aircraft, including 
with respect to marketing the DC-10 Aircraft, whether to make modifications to
the DC-10 Aircraft, the terms of each sublease (or lease), and the 
administration and enforcement of each sublease (or lease) (a) as if MDC (or 
MDFC) were the owner of the Aircraft, (b) without regard to the sharing and 
other provisions of this Agreement, and (c) without any intent to benefit 
interests of MDC (or MDFC) not related to the Aircraft that will be or is 
subleased or leased, if such decisions, terms or action or inaction of MDC (or
MDFC) would be detrimental to the rights or obligations of ILFC or World 
hereunder.

     MDC shall be responsible for the expenses of legal and other services and
of modifications to the Aircraft which MDC chooses to provide to a sublessee, 
as provided in the prior paragraph (the "Sublease Expenses"). Sublease 
Expenses shall be amortized (and applied as described in Section 6.2) in 
monthly installments over the scheduled term of the sublease of each Aircraft,
with interest at a rate equal to 8.25 percent per annum.

     Notwithstanding the foregoing, MDC shall have no obligation (a) to give 
priority to the sublease of the DC-10 Aircraft in preference to the sale, 
lease or other disposition of any other used aircraft, except for other DC-10 
aircraft, or any new aircraft, whether owned by MDC or by another person for 
whom MDC may provide remarketing services, or (b) to exert efforts with 
respect to the sublease of an Aircraft to a particular potential customer if 
the exertion of such efforts would interfere with or compete with any other 
active marketing, sales or leasing activity of MDC with respect to such 
customer, except that MDC shall offer the DC-10 Aircraft before other DC-10 
aircraft, as set forth above.

     Unless otherwise approved by all of the parties hereto, approval not to 
be unreasonably withheld or delayed, any sublease of an Aircraft shall provide
for rent payable monthly in advance.

6.  Subrents.
    --------

    6.1 Contribution to Subrents. Commencing in August, 1993, and continuing
        ------------------------
each calendar month through March, 2004, during which month the final payments
of Basic Rent (as such term is defined in the Leases) shall be due under the
Leases, each of ILFC and World shall pay to MDC, in immediately available
funds, not later than ten days following receipt of a statement showing

                                      3
<PAGE>
 

the calculation of the payment and an invoice therefor, an amount for each of 
the DC-10 Aircraft equal to one third (1/3) of the excess, if any, of (i) 
$300,000 over (ii) the sum of the regular scheduled payments of rent actually 
received by MDC under a sublease of the Aircraft for the month (the 
"Subrents"). The subrents shall equal zero and, therefore, the excess of (i) 
over (ii) above shall equal $300,000 if the Aircraft has not been subleased 
during the month or, for any reason, no regular scheduled payments of rent 
actually have been received by MDC on account of the Aircraft in the month. 
Notwithstanding the foregoing, the aggregate obligation of ILFC and World 
under this Section 6.1 and Section 10 shall be limited to a maximum of 
$3,700,000, to be shared equally between them, such that neither ILFC nor 
World shall be required to pay a sum greater than $1,850,000.

     6.2 Sharing of Subrents. If (i) the Subrents produced by either of the 
         -------------------
DC-10 Aircraft for any calendar month during the term of the Leases exceed 
(ii) the sum of $350,000 plus the installment, if any, of Sublease Expenses 
attributable to such Aircraft for such month, then MDC shall pay to each of 
ILFC and World for the Aircraft, in immediately available funds not later than
ten days following receipt of such rent, a sum equal to one third (1/3) of the
excess of (i) over (ii) above and shall furnish to each of ILFC and World a 
statement showing the calculation of the payment. Subrents shall be shared for
both of the DC-10 Aircraft if each Aircraft is eligible for sharing.

     6.3 Release of ILFC and World. If MDC shall refuse to accept an offer to 
         -------------------------
sublease, for a rental payable monthly in advance (or on such other terms as 
approved by all of the parties hereto) of not less than $300,000 per Aircraft,
one or both of the DC-10 Aircraft, tendered by a Permitted U.S. Air Carrier or
Permitted Foreign Air Carrier (as such terms are defined in the Leases) or by 
a foreign sublessee consented to by MDFC, which proposed sublease contains 
terms generally comparable with the terms of the Leases, then ILFC and World 
shall have no further obligation to make contributions to or right to receive 
a share of the Subrents produced by the Aircraft to be subleased. This Section
6.3 shall not apply to an offer to sublease tendered more than 30 days prior 
to the Effective Date.

     6.4 Consent of MDFC. MDFC shall not unreasonably withhold its consent to 
         ---------------
a sublease with a foreign sublessee, even though not included in the list of 
Permitted Foreign Air Carriers current on the date MDFC receives notice of the
proposed sublease (the "Approved List"), provided the sublessee has credit 
comparable, in MDFC's reasonable judgment, to other air carriers included in 
the Approved List.

     6.5 Casualty; Sale. In the event of the sale or a total loss, 
         --------------
constructive total loss or permanent condemnation or

                                      4
<PAGE>
 
seizure of an Aircraft, all rights and obligations of the parties hereto with 
respect to such Aircraft shall be deemed terminated except to the extent 
already accrued.

7. [Intentionally Deleted]

8. Adjustment of Obligations. MDC shall reimburse ILFC and World on account
   -------------------------
of payments made to MDC by them under Section 5, 6 or 10 hereof, and MDFC 
shall reimburse MDC, ILFC and World on account of payments made to MDFC by 
them under Section 5 or 10 hereof (all of such payments referred to herein as 
"Compensation Payments"), without interest, to the extent that MDC or MDFC, as
the case may be (the "Compensated Party"), subsequently receives recovery of 
payments from a sublessee, a New Lessee (as such term is hereinafter defined) 
or another source, on account of which the Compensation Payments were made. 
Conversely, the obligation of ILFC and World to make Compensation Payments to 
MDC and the obligation of MDC, ILFC and World to make Compensation Payments to
MDFC shall be reinstated to the extent the Compensated Party is required for 
any reason to return any payment, with respect to which the Compensated Party 
would have been entitled to receive Compensation Payments had the required 
payment not been made, previously received from a sublessee or a New Lessee.

9. Indemnities. MDC shall indemnify, defend and hold harmless World and ILFC 
   -----------
from and against any liability, loss, cost or expense suffered or incurred by 
World or ILFC, including, without limitation, reasonable attorneys' fees, 
arising from the use or condition of each Aircraft after its Effective Date, 
except to the extent resulting from the failure of World to return such 
Aircraft in the condition required by Article 13 of the Leases. World and 
WorldCorp affirm the indemnities contained in Article 8 of each of the Leases 
with respect to the period continuing through the respective Effective Dates, 
which indemnities shall survive the assignment of the Leases to, and the 
assumption thereof by, MDC. World and WorldCorp shall jointly and severally 
indemnify, defend and hold harmless ILFC, MDC and MDFC from and against any 
liability, loss, cost or expense suffered or incurred by ILFC, MDC or MDFC, 
including, without limitation, reasonable attorneys' fees, arising from the 
failure of World to satisfy the conditions contained in Section 3 (a), (b) or 
(c) hereof (except to the extent waived).

10. Certain Rights of MDFC. Upon not less than ten days prior written notice
    ----------------------
given by MDFC to the sublessee and the other parties to this Agreement, MDC 
shall assign to MDFC any sublease of an Aircraft and the Lease of the Aircraft
shall be terminated, so that the sublease shall be reconstituted as a direct 
lease (the "New Lease") of the Aircraft between MDFC, as lessor, and the 
sublessee, as lessee (the "New Lessee"). Thereafter, MDC shall guaranty the 
New Lessee's performance under the New Lease and, commencing with the calendar
month in which the next

                                      5
<PAGE>
 
scheduled payment of Basic Rent under the Lease would have become due but for 
the termination of the Lease, and continuing each calendar month thereafter 
until the expiration or earlier termination of the New Lease, MDC shall pay to
MDFC, in immediately available funds, not later than ten days following 
receipt of a statement showing the calculation of the payment and an invoice 
therefor, an amount equal to the excess, if any, of Basic Rent that would have
become due under the Lease over rent actually received by MDFC under the New 
Lease for the month (the "New Rental"). In turn, each of ILFC and World shall 
pay to MDC an amount equal to one third of the excess, if any, of $300,000 
over the New Rental (but subject to the maximum limitation contained in the 
last sentence of Section 6.1), in immediately available funds, not later than 
ten days following receipt of a statement showing the calculation of the 
payment and an invoice therefor. If the New Rental exceeds the Basic Rent that
