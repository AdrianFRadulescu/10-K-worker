ITEM 1.  BUSINESS
 
                 INDUSTRY SEGMENTS AND PRODUCT CLASSIFICATIONS
 
    TRW  is an international company  that provides advanced technology products
and services.  The principal  businesses of  TRW and  its subsidiaries  are  the

primarily  to  original  equipment  manufacturers. In  addition,  TRW  sells its
automotive components  for  use  as  aftermarket  parts  to  original  equipment
manufacturers  and others for resale  through their own independent distribution
networks.
 
SPACE & DEFENSE
 
    TRW's Space  & Defense  segment includes  spacecraft, software  and  systems
engineering support services and electronic systems, equipment and services.
 
    The  Company's spacecraft activities  include the design  and manufacture of
spacecraft equipment,  propulsion  subsystems,  electro-optical  and  instrument
systems,  spacecraft payloads, high-energy lasers and laser technology and other
high-reliability components.  TRW's  software and  systems  engineering  support
services  are in  the fields  of command and  control, security  for defense and

<PAGE>
control,  guidance, navigation,  electric power, sensing  and electronic display
equipment. While classified  projects are  not discussed  herein, the  operating
results   relating  to  classified  projects   are  included  in  the  Company's
consolidated financial statements  and the business  risks associated with  such
projects  do not differ materially  from those of other  projects for the United
States Government.
 
    TRW also performs diverse testing and  general research projects in many  of
the  technical disciplines related to its  Space & Defense products and services
under both private  and United  States Government  contracts, including  several
advanced defense system projects.
 
INFORMATION SYSTEMS & SERVICES
 
    TRW's  Information  Systems  &  Services  segment  includes  consumer credit
information  services,  real  estate  information  services,  direct   marketing
services and business credit information services.
 
    Products  and  services  in  this industry  segment  are  sold  primarily to
commercial entities. Consumer and business credit information services are  sold
primarily   to  credit-granting   organizations  and   businesses.  Real  estate
information services are  sold to  financial institutions,  title companies  and
other  customers.  Marketing services  are  sold primarily  to  direct marketing
customers.
 
    On February  9,  1996,  the  Company  entered  into  an  agreement  to  sell
substantially  all  of  the businesses  in  the Information  Systems  & Services
segment. The proposed sale, which has been structured as a recapitalization  and
is  expected to be completed in the second half of 1996, is subject to corporate
and governmental  approvals  and  certain  significant  conditions  to  closing,
including the implementation of certain computer systems.
 
                          RESULTS BY INDUSTRY SEGMENT
 
    Reference  is made  to the  information relating  to the  Company's industry
segments, including sales, operating profit and identifiable assets attributable
to each segment for  each of the  years 1993 through  1995, presented under  the
note  entitled "Industry segments" in the Notes to Financial Statements on pages
37 and 38 of the TRW 1995 Annual Report. Such information is incorporated herein
by reference.
 
                        FOREIGN AND DOMESTIC OPERATIONS
 
    TRW manufactures products and has facilities in 23 countries throughout  the
world.  TRW's operations  outside the United  States are  in Australia, Austria,
Brazil, Canada, China, the Czech Republic, France, Germany, India, Italy, Japan,
Malaysia, Mexico, Poland,  South Africa, South  Korea, Spain, Taiwan,  Thailand,
Turkey, the United Kingdom and Venezuela. TRW also exports products manufactured
by  it in the United  States. Such export sales accounted  for 8% of total sales
during 1995, 7% of total sales during 1994 and 6% during 1993, or $842  million,
$638 million and $438 million, respectively.
 
    TRW's foreign operations are subject to the usual risks that may affect such
operations.  These include, among other  things, customary exchange controls and
currency  restrictions,  currency  fluctuations,   changes  in  local   economic
conditions,  exposure  to possible  expropriation  or other  government actions,
unsettled political conditions and foreign government-sponsored boycotts of  the
Company's   products  or  services  for   noncommercial  reasons.  Most  of  the
identifiable assets  associated with  TRW's foreign  operations are  located  in
countries where the Company believes such risks to be minimal.
 
    Reference  is  made to  the information  relating to  the dollar  amounts of
sales, operating profit and identifiable assets  by geographic area for each  of
the  years  1993  through 1995  presented  under the  note  entitled "Geographic
segments" in the Notes to Financial Statements on page 38 of the TRW 1995 Annual
Report. Such information is incorporated herein by reference.

                                    GENERAL
 
COMPETITION
 
    TRW encounters  intense competition  in substantially  all segments  of  its
business.  The Company's competitive position  varies for its different products
and services. However, TRW believes that it is a significant supplier of many of
the products it manufactures and of many of the services it provides.
 
    In the  Automotive segment,  competitors  include independent  suppliers  of
parts and components as well as the Company's original equipment customers, many
of  whom are integrated  manufacturers and produce  or could produce substantial
portions of their requirements for parts and components internally. Depending on
the particular  product,  the  number  of the  Company's  competitors  may  vary
significantly  and  many  of the  products  have high  capital  requirements and
require high  engineering  content. In  the  Automotive segment,  the  principal
methods  of  competition  are price,  engineering  excellence,  product quality,
customer service, delivery time and proprietary position.
 
    TRW competes for contracts  covering a variety  of United States  Government
projects  and  programs,  principally in  the  Space  & Defense  segment  of its
business. Such  competition is  based primarily  on technical  ability,  product
quality  and  price. TRW's  competitors for  United States  Government contracts
typically are large, technically-competent firms with substantial assets.
 
    In its Information Systems & Services  segment, TRW competes in markets  for
consumer  and  business  credit information  services,  real  estate information
services and marketing services with other large firms doing business nationally
and with many  smaller local  and regional  firms. Competitive  factors in  this
business  include  proprietary  position,  product  quality,  customer  service,
delivery time and price.
 
CUSTOMERS
 
    Sales, directly and indirectly, to  the United States Government,  including
the Department of Defense, the National Aeronautics and Space Administration and
other  agencies, constituted 28%  of TRW's sales  for 1995 and  28% for 1994, or
$2,899 million  and $2,545  million, respectively.  Sales to  the United  States
Government  represented 93% of the sales of  the Space & Defense segment in 1995
and 90% in 1994, or $2,887 million and $2,528 million, respectively.
 
    Companies engaged in  United States  Government contracting  are subject  to
certain   unique   business   risks,  including   dependence   on  Congressional
appropriations and  administrative allotment  of  funds, changes  in  Government
policies that may reflect military and political developments, time required for
design  and development, significant changes  in contract scheduling, complexity
of designs and the rapidity with which they become obsolete, necessity of design
improvements, difficulty  in forecasting  costs and  schedules when  bidding  on
developmental   and  highly  sophisticated  technical  work  and  other  factors
characteristic of the industry.
 
    United States Government contracting laws  also provide that the  Government
is  to do business only with responsible contractors. In this regard, the United
States Department  of Defense  and other  federal agencies  have the  authority,
under  certain circumstances, to suspend or debar a contractor or organizational
parts of a contractor from further  Government contracting for a certain  period
"to  protect the  Government's interest."  Such action  may be  taken for, among
other reasons, commission of  fraud or a criminal  offense in connection with  a
United  States  Government  contract. A  suspension  may  also be  imposed  if a
contractor is  indicted for  such matters.  In the  event of  any suspension  or
debarment,  the Company's existing contracts would continue unless terminated or
canceled by the United States Government under applicable contract provisions.
 
    Other than the United States Government, TRW's largest customers (determined
by including sales to their affiliates throughout the world but excluding  sales
to  such customers or  their affiliates that  ultimately result in  sales to the
United States  Government) are  Ford Motor  Company, Volkswagen  AG and  General
Motors  Corporation. Such sales by TRW's  Automotive segment to Ford, Volkswagen
and General Motors and their  respective subsidiaries during 1995 accounted  for
23%,  10%  and 10%,  respectively,  of total  sales  of the  Automotive segment,
compared to 24%, 9% and 10%, respectively, during 1994.

BACKLOG
 
    The backlog of  orders for  TRW's domestic operations,  without options,  at
December  31, 1995 and December 31, 1994 is estimated to have been approximately
$5,438 million and $4,640 million, respectively, of which it is estimated  that,
directly   or  indirectly,  United  States  Government  business  accounted  for
approximately $4,466 million and $3,895 million, respectively. Reported  backlog
at the end of 1995 does not include approximately $2.6 billion of negotiated and
priced,   but  unexercised,  options  for   defense  and  non-defense  programs.
Unexercised options at the end of 1994 were valued at $1.0 billion. The exercise
of options  is  at the  discretion  of  the customer,  and  as in  the  case  of
Government  contracts generally, dependent on  future government funding. Of the
total domestic backlog at December  31, 1995 and at  December 31, 1994, 90%  and
89%,  respectively,  were  attributable  to the  Space  &  Defense  segment, and
virtually all of the backlog  attributable to United States Government  business
related to that segment.
 
    The   determination  of  TRW's   backlog  involves  substantial  estimating,
particularly with  respect  to  customer requirements  contracts  and  long-term
contracts  of a cost-reimbursement or incentive nature. A substantial portion of
the variations in the estimated backlog  of TRW in recent years is  attributable
to  the timing  of the  award and  performance of  United States  Government and
certain other contracts. Subject to various qualifications, including those  set
forth  herein,  and  assuming  no  terminations,  cancellations  or  changes and
completion of orders in the normal course, TRW has estimated that  approximately
55%  of the December 31, 1995 backlog will be delivered in 1996, 24% in 1997 and
21% thereafter.
 
    United States Government contracts and related customer orders generally are
subject to termination in whole or in part at the convenience of the  Government
whenever  the Government  believes that  such termination  would be  in its best
interest. Multi-year  Government contracts  and related  orders are  subject  to
cancellation  if funds for contract performance for any subsequent contract year
become unavailable. If any of its Government contracts were to be terminated  or
canceled  under these circumstances, TRW generally  would be entitled to receive
payment for  work completed  and allowable  termination or  cancellation  costs.
Whether  the occurrence  of any such  termination or cancellation  would have an
adverse effect  on  TRW  would  depend upon  the  particular  contract  and  the
circumstances of the termination or cancellation.
 
    Backlog  data  and comparisons  thereof  as of  different  dates may  not be
reliable indicators of  either future sales  or the ratio  of future direct  and
indirect United States Government sales to other sales.
 
INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY
 
    TRW  owns  significant intellectual  property, including  a large  number of
patents, copyrights and  trade secrets,  and is involved  in numerous  licensing
arrangements.  Although TRW's intellectual  property plays an  important role in
maintaining TRW's  competitive position  in  a number  of  the markets  that  it
serves,  no  single patent,  copyright,  trade secret  or  license, or  group of
related patents, copyrights, trade  secrets or licenses, is,  in the opinion  of
management,  of such value  to TRW that the  business of TRW  or of any industry
segment of TRW  would be materially  affected by the  expiration or  termination
thereof. TRW's general policy is to apply for patents on an ongoing basis in the
United  States  and appropriate  other countries  on its  significant patentable
developments.  TRW  is  party  to  a  lawsuit  involving  air  bag  patents  and
technology.  See "Item 3. -- Legal Proceedings" for a further discussion of this
suit.
 
    TRW also views its name and mark as significant to its business as a  whole.
In  addition, TRW  owns a number  of other  trade names and  marks applicable to
certain of  its businesses  and products  that  it views  as important  to  such
businesses and products.
 
RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT
 
    Research  and development costs  totaled $1,963 million,  $1,709 million and
$1,737 million in 1995,  1994 and 1993,  respectively, of which  customer-funded
research  and development was $1,387 million in 1995, $1,157 million in 1994 and
$1,223 million in  1993. Company-funded  research and  development costs,  which
included  research and development for commercial products, independent research
and development and  bid and proposal  work related to  government products  and
services, totaled $422 million in 1995, $412 million in 1994 and $378 million in
1993.
 
                                       4
<PAGE>
A  portion of the cost incurred for independent research and development and bid
and  proposal  work  is  recoverable  through  overhead  charged  to  government
contracts.  Company-funded product development  costs, including engineering and
field support for  new customer requirements,  were $154 million  in 1995,  $140
million in 1994 and $136 million in 1993.
 
EMPLOYEES
 
    At  December  31,  1995, TRW  had  approximately 66,500  employees,  of whom
approximately 37,000 were employed in the United States.
 
RAW MATERIALS AND SUPPLIES
 
    Materials used by TRW include or  contain steel, stainless steel, pig  iron,
ferro-chrome,  aluminum, brass,  copper, tin,  platinum, special  alloys, sodium
azide, glass,  ceramics, plastic  powders and  laminations, carbon  and  plastic
materials,  synthetic rubber, paper,  and gold, silver,  nickel, zinc and copper
plating materials. TRW also purchases from suppliers various types of  equipment
and  component  parts  that may  include  such materials.  TRW's  operations are
dependent upon  the  ability  of  its  suppliers  of  materials,  equipment  and
component  parts  to meet  performance and  quality specifications  and delivery
schedules. In some  cases, there is  only a  limited number of  suppliers for  a
material  or product  due to  the specialized nature  of the  item. Shortages of
certain raw materials, equipment  and component parts have  existed in the  past
and  may exist again in the  future. TRW has taken a  number of steps to protect
against and  to minimize  the  effect of  such  shortages. However,  any  future
inability  of TRW  to obtain raw  materials, equipment or  component parts could
have a  material  adverse effect  on  the  Company. TRW's  operations  also  are
dependent  on adequate  supplies of  energy. TRW  has continued  its programs to
conserve energy  used  in its  operations  and has  made  available  alternative
sources of energy.
 
ENVIRONMENTAL REGULATIONS
 
    Federal, state and local requirements relating to the discharge of materials
into   the  environment,  or  otherwise  relating   to  the  protection  of  the
environment, have  had and  will  continue to  have an  effect  on TRW  and  its
operations. The Company has made and continues to make expenditures for projects
relating  to the  environment, including pollution  control devices  for new and
existing facilities.  The  Company  is  conducting  a  number  of  environmental
investigations  and remedial actions at current  and former Company locations to
comply with  various  federal,  state  and local  laws  and,  along  with  other
companies,  has been  named a  potentially responsible  party for  certain waste
management sites. Each of these matters is subject to various uncertainties, and
some of these  matters may  be resolved unfavorably  to the  Company. A  reserve
estimate  reflecting cost ranges is  established using standard engineering cost
estimating techniques  for  each  matter for  which  sufficient  information  is
available.  In the determination  of cost ranges, consideration  is given to the
professional judgment of the  Company's environmental engineers in  consultation
with outside environmental specialists when necessary. At multi-party sites, the
reserve  estimate also reflects  the expected allocation  of total project costs
among the various  potentially responsible  parties. At December  31, 1995,  the
Company  had reserves  for environmental  matters of  $84 million,  including $7
million of accruals recorded during  the year. The Company aggressively  pursues
reimbursement  for environmental  costs from  its insurance  carriers. Insurance
recoveries are recorded  as a reduction  of environmental costs  when fixed  and
determinable.  The Company does  not believe that  compliance with environmental
protection laws and  regulations will have  a material effect  upon its  capital
expenditures  or  competitive  position,  and  TRW's  capital  expenditures  for
environmental control facilities  during 1996 and  1997 are not  expected to  be
material to the Company. The Company believes that any liability that may result
from the resolution of environmental matters for which sufficient information is
available  to support cost estimates will not  have a material adverse effect on
the Company's earnings. However, the Company cannot predict the effect on future
earnings of  expenditures for  aspects of  certain matters  for which  there  is
insufficient  information. In addition, the Company cannot predict the effect on
future earnings  of  compliance with  environmental  laws and  regulations  with
respect  to currently  unknown environmental matters  or the  possible effect on
future earnings of  compliance with  environmental requirements  imposed in  the
future.

</TABLE>
 
    On an industry segment basis, capital expenditures during 1995 and 1994 were
as follows: Automotive,  $314 million  and $388 million,  respectively; Space  &
Defense,  $114 million and $98 million,  respectively; and Information Systems &
Services,  $19  million  and  $18   million,  respectively.  Of  total   capital
expenditures, 67% in 1995 and 64% in 1994 were invested in the United States.
 
ITEM 2.  PROPERTIES
 
    TRW's  operations include  numerous manufacturing,  research and development
and warehousing facilities located in 28 states  in the United States and in  22
other  countries.  TRW owns  a majority  of its  facilities; the  remainder were
leased. In 1995, approximately 42% of  the domestic facilities were used by  the
Automotive  segment, 50% were  used by the  Space & Defense  segment and 8% were
used by the  Information Systems &  Services segment. Substantially  all of  the
foreign facilities were used by the Automotive segment.
 
    The  Company also  owns or leases  certain smaller  research and development
properties  and  administrative,   processing,  marketing,   sales  and   office
facilities  throughout the United States  and in various parts  of the world. In
addition, TRW operates facilities  on property owned  directly or indirectly  by
the  United  States  Government.  The Company  owns  its  world  headquarters in
Lyndhurst, Ohio and its regional headquarters for its Space & Defense segment in
Redondo Beach, California.
 
    In the opinion of  management, the Company's  facilities are generally  well
maintained and are suitable and adequate for their intended use.
 
    Reference is made to the information concerning long-term rental obligations
under  operating leases presented under the note entitled "Lease commitments" in
the Notes to Financial Statements on page 35 of the TRW 1995 Annual Report. Such
information is incorporated herein by reference.
 
ITEM 3.  LEGAL PROCEEDINGS
 
    On December  15,  1987,  the  Commissioner  of  the  Indiana  Department  of
Environmental  Management issued an  Order to TRW  and several other respondents
relating to alleged  contamination of  the public water  supply in  Shelbyville,
Indiana  by,  among  other sources,  two  closed facilities  that  were formerly
operated by TRW's  Connectors Division.  The Order requires  the respondents  to
fund  the relocation of the  main well field for  Shelbyville to a location that
can  provide  a  safe  source  of  potable  water  and  to  perform  a  remedial
investigation of the source and extent of contamination within a one-mile radius
of the well field. The Order also requires the
 
                                       6
<PAGE>
respondents  to pay  civil penalties  of $25,000 per  day for  violations of law
which allegedly  occurred  prior to  issuance  of the  Order.  TRW has  filed  a
petition  for review of the Order. The Order  is not expected to have a material
effect on the Company's financial position.
 
    On February 15, 1994, TRW filed suit in the United States District Court for
the District  of Arizona  against  Talley Industries,  Inc. and  certain  Talley
subsidiary  companies. The suit  relates to TRW's 1989  purchase of Talley's air
bag business. In  the complaint,  TRW claimed  that, among  other violations  of
TRW's  rights,  Talley  breached  the  non-compete  provision  contained  in the
purchase agreement by providing products and services to competitors of TRW.  As
a  result of the  breach, TRW exercised  its rights under  the agreement and the
license from Talley to TRW to make a one-time payment of $26.5 million to Talley
for a  paid-up  royalty-free  license  to  use  Talley's  air  bag  patents  and
technology.  On March 1, 1994, Talley  filed an answer and counterclaims against
TRW alleging that TRW had acted  improperly in making the $26.5 million  payment
and requesting that TRW be ordered to pay immediately to Talley the value of all
anticipated  royalties, claimed by Talley  to be not less  than $250 million. On
May 19, 1994, the court granted Talley's motion for an injunction requiring  TRW
to  continue  to make  quarterly  royalty payments  pursuant  to the  1989 asset
purchase agreement and ancillary  agreements pending trial  of TRW's claims.  On
April  5,  1995,  trial  began  before  a  jury  on  TRW's  claims  and Talley's
counterclaims. On May  30, 1995, at  the close  of all the  evidence, the  trial
judge directed a verdict against TRW on TRW's claims against Talley, ruling that
there was not sufficient evidence to send TRW's claims to the jury. However, the
judge  allowed Talley's counterclaims  to go to  the jury. On  June 6, 1995, the
jury entered its verdict that  Talley was entitled to  the present value of  the
future royalty stream in the sum of $138 million on the contract claim, but that
TRW  had not acted in bad faith and  that the technology on which royalties were
due was  limited  to that  in  existence when  TRW  purchased Talley's  air  bag
business.
 
    Judgment  was entered against  TRW on June  27, 1995 and  TRW timely filed a
notice of appeal on July 12, 1995. On July 26, 1995, the trial judge entered  an
order requiring that TRW continue to pay quarterly royalty payments to Talley as
they  become  due, notwithstanding  the  fact it  filed  an appropriate  bond in
connection with  its notice  of  appeal. TRW  immediately appealed  the  judge's
ruling requiring that TRW continue to pay the royalties pending appeal; however,
the  Ninth Circuit U.S.  Court of Appeals denied  TRW's appeal without prejudice
and accelerated the schedule for the appeal on the judge's decision directing  a
verdict  against  TRW  in  connection with  TRW's  claims  against  Talley. Oral
argument before the Ninth Circuit took place on February 14, 1996. The  judgment
against  TRW, if  it stands  after appeal,  is not  expected to  have a material
financial effect on the Company.
 
    On November 13, 1995, TRW Vehicle Safety Systems Inc. ("VSSI") entered  into
agreements with the Arizona Attorney General's Office and the Arizona Department
of  Environmental Quality  ("ADEQ") regarding a  September 16,  1994 accident at
Mesa Plant I as well  as other outstanding issues  between VSSI and ADEQ.  Under
the  agreement with the Attorney  General, on November 13,  1995 VSSI pleaded no
contest to a single misdemeanor  charge of violating hazardous waste  management
requirements  which was filed  on the same date.  VSSI agreed to  pay a fine and
restitution of $1.0 million. VSSI also  agreed to pay $100,000 in  investigative
costs  to the Attorney General's office. Under the agreement with the ADEQ, VSSI
agreed to implement plans to  continue to improve emergency response  procedures
and  reporting  requirements as  well as  implement  site assessments  and other
safety and  environmental  quality  studies.  VSSI  agreed  to  pay  $79,000  in
administrative  penalties to ADEQ. The State of Arizona has a penalty assessment
provision of 57% that increased  the total fines paid  by TRW to $1.75  million.
These  actions resolve all  material outstanding proceedings  arising out of the
September 16, 1994 accident.

the  Company's  Directors, will  hold office  for  the ensuing  year or  until a
successor is elected in accordance with  the Company's Regulations. None of  the
Company's  executive officers has  a family relationship  to any other executive
officer.

    In February  1996,  the Company  entered  into  a sales  agreement  to  sell
substantially  all of  the businesses  in the  Information Systems  and Services
segment. The sale  is subject to  corporate and regulatory  approvals and  other
significant  conditions  to  closing, including  the  implementation  of certain
computer systems. The impact of the  proposed divestiture, which is expected  to
result in a gain, has not been fully determined.
 
    In 1993, the Company adopted Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No.
112,  "Employers' Accounting for  Postemployment Benefits," and  took a one-time
charge of $25 million, or $.38 per share, for the prior years' cumulative effect
of the accounting change. The effect of this accounting change on 1993 operating
results, after recording  the cumulative  effect for  years prior  to 1993,  was
immaterial.
 
    In 1992, the Company adopted Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No.
106,  "Employers' Accounting  for Postretirement Benefits  Other Than Pensions,"
for its  U.S. and  Canadian retiree  health care  and life  insurance plans  and
Statement  of  Financial Accounting  Standards No.  109, "Accounting  for Income
Taxes," and took a one-time charge of $350 million, or $5.60 per share, for  the
prior  years' cumulative effect of the accounting changes. In 1992, net earnings
were reduced by  $23 million  for the  change in  accounting for  postretirement
benefits  and were  increased by  $11 million for  the change  in accounting for
income taxes.

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT AUDITORS
 
Shareholders and Directors
TRW Inc.
 
We   have  audited  the  consolidated  financial  statements  of  TRW  Inc.  and
subsidiaries listed in Item 14(a)(1)  of the annual report  on Form 10-K of  TRW
Inc.  for the year ended  December 31, 1995. These  financial statements are the
responsibility of the company's management. Our responsibility is to express  an
opinion on these financial statements based on our audits.
 
We   conducted  our  audits  in  accordance  with  generally  accepted  auditing
standards. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to  obtain
reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material
misstatement.  An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting
the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. An audit also  includes
assessing  the  accounting principles  used  and significant  estimates  made by
management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement  presentation.
We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.
 
In  our opinion, the  financial statements referred to  above present fairly, in
all material  respects, the  consolidated  financial position  of TRW  Inc.  and
subsidiaries  at December  31, 1995  and 1994,  and the  consolidated results of
their operations and their cash flows for each of the three years in the  period
ended  December  31,  1995,  in conformity  with  generally  accepted accounting
principles.
 
As discussed in the  notes to financial statements,  effective January 1,  1993,
the company changed its method of accounting for postemployment benefits.

TRW EXECUTIVE HEALTH CARE PLAN (EHCP)
- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------



INTRODUCTION
The TRW Executive Health Care Plan ("Plan") is a plan which provides payment for
a wide range of health care expenses.

To encourage good health, the Plan covers the expenses for physical
examinations, as well as other preventive care.  A simplified claim
reimbursement procedure is also a major feature of the Plan.

TRW reserves the right to modify or terminate the Plan at its discretion at any
time.

The elections you make when enrolled must remain in effect until the end of the
plan year (calendar year), unless you have an eligible change in life status.
Even then, the only changes allowed are those consistent with your change in
life status or as required to add a dependent as a result of a Qualified Medical
Child Support Order.  Please see allowable life status changes listed in the
ChoicePlus Employee Benefits Book applicable for your unit.

WHO IS ELIGIBLE
You are eligible for the benefits of the Plan as of the date you have been
designated as a member of the Special Executive Group by the Chief Executive
Office.  Your eligible dependents will be covered on the date your coverage
begins or the date he or she becomes a dependent, or is first enrolled,
whichever is latest.  Your eligibility for benefits from any other TRW health
insurance plan will cease when you become a member of the Plan.

CONTRIBUTIONS
All participants are required to contribute to the cost of the Plan.  Your
contribution will be determined by TRW and will be based on the number of
dependents you elect to include in the Plan.  IRS regulations require that your
contribution be made on an "after-tax" basis.  The amount of the contribution
will be reviewed annually.

ELIGIBLE DEPENDENTS
Dependents eligible for benefits are:

- -    your legal spouse;

- -    your unmarried child up to age 19 or age 25, if a full-time student;
     (If the dependent is on an internship through the school and is not
     over age 25, the employee may continue to cover the dependent through
     the end of the internship or age 25.)

- -    your child regardless of age if incapable of self-sustaining employment,
     because of mental or physical disability.

The term "child" also includes your legally adopted child or one placed with you
for adoption, foster child, stepchild, or any other child living with you in a
regular parent-child relationship.  To qualify as a dependent for purposes of
the Plan, each child must also qualify as a "Dependent" under Section 152(a) of
the Internal Revenue Code.  Where this summary of the Plan refers to a dependent
below, it means a person who is eligible to be and has been enrolled in the
Plan.

Dependents not enrolled when first eligible may be added in accordance with the
Life Status Change Rules described in the "Life Status Change" section of the
ChoicePlus Employee Benefits Book.

                                                                         Page 1

TRW EXECUTIVE HEALTH CARE PLAN (EHCP)
- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------

COMPREHENSIVE HEALTH CARE EXPENSE BENEFITS
Full reimbursement will be made for covered medical, dental and vision expenses
incurred by you or your eligible dependents while covered by the Plan.

Reimbursement will be made regardless of where the expenses are incurred-
- -whether in or out of the hospital--as long as they are incurred in connection
with health care (see "Definitions" page 5).  Except as described in the 
section entitled "After Health Care Coverage Terminates" (page 7), all expenses
must be incurred while you or your dependents are covered by the Plan.

An expense or charge will be deemed incurred as of the date the service is
rendered or the supply is furnished.

Services rendered after the termination of coverage will not be paid.

COVERED HEALTH CARE EXPENSES
Covered Health Care Expenses are the reasonable charges incurred in connection
with the medical, dental, and vision care of you or your eligible dependent, and
must be those which would qualify as a tax deduction.  Covered Health Care
Expenses, therefore, are those which are Reasonably Necessary and if not
reimbursed, could be deducted by you (or you and your spouse in a joint return)
when computing your taxable income under Section 213 of the Internal Revenue
Code.  The provision of Section 213 which limits deductible expenses to an
amount measured against adjusted gross income does not apply.

Covered Health Care Expenses include, but are not limited to, the following
expenses for services and supplies:

- -    Room, board, and other medical services and supplies furnished by a
     hospital or other institution qualified to provide medical care.

- -    Services of any legally qualified doctor of medicine (M.D.), doctor of
     osteopathy (D.O.), doctor of podiatry (D.P.M.), doctor of chiropracty
     (D.C.), doctor of optometry (O.D.), doctor of chiropody (D.P.M. - D.S. C.),
     dentist (D.D.S. or D.M.D.), Christian Science practitioner listed in the
     Christian Science Journal (C.S.), registered nurse (R.N.), licensed
     practical or vocational nurse under the direction of an R.N. (L.P.N. or
     L.V.N.), midwife, physician's assistant certified by the National
     Commission on Certification of Physicians' Assistants (P.A.), audiologist,
     occupational therapist, physical therapist, psychologist, respiratory
     therapist, social worker, or speech therapist.

- -    Necessary transportation to and from an area or facility where the services
     or supplies covered hereunder may be obtained, including transportation by
     personal automobile.

- -    Drugs or medicines prescribed by a physician.

- -    Purchase or rental of medical or surgical supplies, aids, and prosthetic
     appliances, including eyeglasses, hearing aids, or dental prosthetic
     appliances.

Examples of health care expenses that must be approved in advance are shown on
page 3.  Examples of health care expenses covered and NOT covered are shown on
pages 3 and 4.

                                                                         Page 2

EXAMPLES OF HEALTH CARE EXPENSES TO BE APPROVED IN ADVANCE
Since reimbursement is made only when the expense is both reasonable and tax
deductible, you should request approval from The Prudential Insurance Company
(216-668-6662) for any unusual expense prior to the date it is incurred.  Some
examples of expenses that must be approved in advance are:

- -    Charges made by suppliers other than:
    -    licensed medical practitioners,
    -    licensed medical care institutions, or
    -    providers of medically-related services and supplies.
- -   Charges representing, in whole or in part, expenses of a capital nature.
- -   Charges for medically necessary cosmetic procedures, including surgery.
- -   Charges which appear to have been made for purely custodial care.
- -   Charges for the use of scheduled airline and any other transportation
    expense except:
    -    Those representing reimbursement for the reasonable use of a personal
         auto at the prevailing rate per mile, as defined by the IRS for
          medical transportation.
    -    Those representing the actual cost of any mode of necessary emergency
         transportation.
- -   Meals and lodging not furnished by a hospital or similar institution
    as a necessary incident to medical care.
- -   Dental implants.

                                                                          Page 3

DEFINITIONS

COSMETIC SURGERY
A procedure done to improve a patient's appearance and not to promote the body's
proper function or to prevent or treat a disease.

HEALTH CARE
The diagnosis, cure, mitigation, treatment or prevention of disease, or
treatment affecting any structure or function of the body due to defect, illness
or accidental bodily injury, or care during and following pregnancy, including
treatment of any condition arising therefrom.

INTERNAL REVENUE CODE
Chapter 1 of Subtitle A of Title 26 of the United States Code of 1986, as
currently constituted and as it may be later amended.

PLAN
The TRW Executive Health Care Plan ("Plan") is a plan which provides payment for
a wide range of health care expenses.  As used in this booklet, the term Plan
refers to the "TRW Executive Health Care Plan."

REASONABLE CHARGE
An amount determined by the frequency, duration, and cost of services and
supplies as compared with those customarily incurred for similarly situated
individuals.

REASONABLY NECESSARY
The service or supply must be ordered by a physician and must be commonly and
customarily recognized throughout the physician's profession as appropriate in
the treatment of the patient's diagnosed sickness or injury.  The service or
supply must not be educational or experimental in nature, nor provided primarily
for the purpose of medical or other research.  In addition, in the case of
hospital confinement on an inpatient basis, the length of confinement and
hospital services and supplies will be considered "Reasonably Necessary" only to
the extent that they are determined by The Prudential to be (a) related to the
treatment of the condition involved and (b) not allocable to scholastic
education or vocational training of the patient.

TOTAL DISABILITY
1.  Your complete inability to perform every duty pertaining to your occupation
    or employment.
2.  Your dependent's complete inability to perform the normal activities of a
    person of similar age and sex.

                                                                          Page 5

TRW EXECUTIVE HEALTH CARE PLAN (EHCP)
- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------

PAYMENT OF CLAIMS AND RECORDKEEPING
The Plan will reimburse you for covered expenses promptly after receipt of your
claim.  The Plan is designed to reimburse participants directly for covered
expenses.  You may wish to authorize payment directly to the provider in the
case of significant expense such as in the case of hospital confinement.
Benefits should not be assigned for other than a significant expense.

Participants should file a claim for reimbursement by the Plan of any expenses
resulting from an annual physical.  Examinations may be performed by any
physician selected by the participant, who is located within a reasonable
distance of the participant's home.  The procedures for claiming reimbursement
for the expense of the examination are the same as for any other expenses.

You may claim reimbursement of any Covered Health Care Expense simply by
completing a "Claim Expense Form," attaching a copy of either your bill or
receipt, and sending it to your Plan representative (as indicated in your
enrollment package issued to all members when first eligible for the Plan) or if
on direct claim processing, submit it directly to The Prudential Insurance
Company.  If more convenient, however, you may use an itemized statement to
claim reimbursement and not complete the Claim Expense Form.  Itemized
statements must include the following information:

- -   Name and social security number of patient.
- -   Nature of illness or injury.
- -   Name, address, and tax identification number of the doctor, hospital, or
    supplier.
- -   Date of charge.
- -   Amount of charge.

Cancelled checks or balance due bills are not acceptable as proof of loss.

A claim for reimbursement must be made within two years after incurring the
expense.  In the case of minor expenses, it may be helpful for you to record
them on the Claim Expense Form at the time they are incurred, and file for
reimbursement when you feel a sufficient amount has been accumulated.  A
separate Claim Expense Form must be submitted for each individual family member
for whom a claim is filed; therefore, records of medical expenses incurred for
yourself and each of your dependents should be kept separately.

COORDINATION OF BENEFITS PROVISION
The purpose of health care coverage is to reimburse participants for health care
expenses which they have incurred.  In line with that purpose, our Plan contains
a provision for coordinating with other group plans under which an employee or
dependent is covered so that the total benefits available do not exceed 100
percent of the allowable expenses.

When there is coverage by two or more group plans for health care treatment for
an employee and/or dependent, the insurance companies involved work together to
arrive at a payment of up to 100 percent of the allowable expenses, but no more.
If any of your dependents are employed and have other coverage, that coverage is
considered primary.  In this case, the individual should submit the claim/bill
to his/her primary insurance carrier first.  Once the individual receives an
explanation of benefits (EOB) from the primary insurance carrier and if there is
a balance owing, he/she can then submit a copy of the original bill and the EOB
from the primary insurance carrier to the secondary payer (The Prudential).
Alternately, if he/she has received a statement from the provider
(doctor/dentist, etc.) which shows the amount the primary insurance carrier has
paid and a balance owed by the patient, he/she can submit this document alone to
The Prudential for payment.  No other documentation is needed in this situation
in order for The Prudential to pay as secondary payer.

                                                                          Page 6

TRW EXECUTIVE HEALTH CARE PLAN (EHCP)
- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------

REIMBURSEMENT FROM A THIRD PARTY
If a covered person receives Plan benefits to which that person is not entitled
under the Plan (because a third party is responsible), the covered person will
be charged for the amount of such benefits that have been paid by this Plan.

When someone other than the covered person is responsible for a sickness or
injury, the covered person must, in return for the Plan's providing benefits for
that sickness or injury, reimburse the Plan immediately upon receipt of any
payments or damages with respect to that sickness or injury.

Examples include payments received through a lawsuit, a settlement, or from any
third party or his or her insurer (including no-fault insurance).  The
employee's agreement to reimburse the Plan will apply regardless of whether the
responsible party admits liability or the payments are itemized.

WHEN YOUR HEALTH CARE COVERAGE TERMINATES
Your coverage under the Plan will terminate, unless otherwise agreed in writing,
at the earliest time stated below:

1.  the end of the month next following the month in which your employment
    terminates;

2.  the end of the month coinciding with the month in which your retirement
    from active employment is effective;

3.  the date you cease to be a member of the Special Executive Group, or;

4.  the date the Plan is discontinued or modified.

In addition to the above, coverage terminates with respect to an individual
dependent when he/she ceases to meet the eligibility requirements of the Plan
(i.e., a child who reaches the age limit or a spouse who becomes divorced from
you).  However, coverage will not terminate until the end of the third month
following the month in which a dependent attains the applicable age limitation
or the divorce is effective.

In the event of your death while covered by the Plan, coverage for your
dependents will be continued for a period of six months following the end of the
month in which death occurs.

AFTER HEALTH CARE COVERAGE TERMINATES
Reimbursement will not be made for expenses which are incurred after coverage
terminates unless they are incurred with respect to an injury or illness,
including pregnancy, that cause you or your dependent to be continuously and
totally disabled from such termination date.  Only those expenses incurred
relating to a continuous and total disability during the calendar year in which
coverage terminates and the next calendar year shall be reimbursed, unless such
expenses are reimbursed under any other group insurance policy or plan.

CONTINUATION OF COVERAGE--COBRA
Under the provisions of the Consolidated Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act
(COBRA),  you or your dependents are eligible to continue coverage, at your
expense, but only if that coverage ends as the result of one of the following
"qualifying events."

1.  Termination of employment for any reason (except gross misconduct);
    reduction in hours, layoff or retirement;

2.  Death of the employee;

3.  Divorce or legal separation;

4.  Loss of dependent status by a dependent child due to attainment of the
    maximum age limitation under the Plan, or cessation of full-time schooling.

COST OF COBRA COVERAGE
Coverage may be continued at the same rates applicable to active employees, with
an administration charge of two percent.  You are required to pay the full cost
of the coverage.

DURATION OF COBRA COVERAGE
If your active employee coverage would cease because of retirement, termination
of employment, layoff, leave of absence, or reduction in your work hours, you or
your dependents may elect to continue the existing coverage for up to 18 months
from the date of the qualifying event (or up to 29 months if disabled).  For all
other qualifying events, you or your dependents may elect to continue coverage
for up to 36 months.

However, COBRA coverage will not continue beyond the date that the earliest of
the following occurs:

1.  Failure to pay the required premiums.

2.  Entitlement to Medicare.

3.  Coverage under another employer-sponsored health plan which does not
    contain pre-existing condition exclusions applicable to the COBRA
    participant.

4.  Any payment of COBRA costs by the company will not extend the applicable 18
    or 36 month period.

If your dependent loses coverage as a result of a divorce or loss of dependent
status, it is your or your dependent's responsibility to advise TRW within 60
days of the later of the qualifying event or the date of loss of coverage, if
you wish to continue coverage.

Any questions regarding the COBRA eligibility and coverage provisions should be
directed to your TRW Plan representative.

TRW RETIREMENT MEDICAL PLAN
If your coverage is ceasing due to your retirement, you may be entitled to
enroll in TRW's Retirement Medical Plan (RMP). At retirement, you may elect only
one option--RMP or COBRA.

                                                                          Page 8

EMPLOYEE RIGHTS

As a participant in this benefit Plan at TRW Inc., you are entitled to:

- -    Examine, without charge, at the Plan Administrator's office all Plan
     documents filed for the Plan with the U. S. Department of Labor, such as
     annual reports and Plan descriptions and all insurance contracts.

- -    Obtain copies of all Plan documents and other Plan information upon written
     request to the Plan Administrator.  The Administrator may make a reasonable
     charge for the copies.

- -    Receive a summary of the Plan's annual financial report.  The Plan
     Administrator is required by law to furnish each participant with a copy of
     this summary annual report.

In addition to creating rights for Plan participants, ERISA imposes obligations
upon the persons who are responsible for the operation of the employee benefit
Plan.  These persons are referred to as "fiduciaries" in the law.  Fiduciaries
must act in the interest of the Plan participants and do so prudently.
Fiduciaries who violate ERISA may be removed and required to make good any
losses they have caused the Plan.

Your employer may not fire you or discriminate against you to prevent you from
obtaining a benefit or exercising your rights under ERISA.

If you are improperly denied a benefit in full or in part, you have a right to
file suit in a federal or state court.  You may also file suit in federal court
if any Plan documents or any other materials to which you are entitled are not
received within 30 days of your written request, and the court may require the
Plan Administrator to pay up to $100 for each day's delay until the materials
are received, unless the failure was beyond the control of the Plan
Administrator.

If Plan fiduciaries are misusing the Plan's money, or if you are discriminated
against for asserting your rights, you have the right to file suit in a federal
court or request assistance from the U.S. Department of Labor.  The court will
decide who should pay court costs and legal fees.  If you are successful in your
lawsuit, the court may, if it so decides, require the other party to pay your
legal costs, including attorney's fees.  If you lose, the court may order you to
pay these costs and fees, for example, if it finds your claim is frivolous.

If you have any questions about this statement or your rights under ERISA, you
should contact the Plan Administrator or the nearest Area Office of the U.S.
Labor-Management Service Administration, Department of Labor.

                                                                         Page 11

  (SOCIAL SECURITY NUMBER)


There hereby is granted to you, as a key employee of TRW Inc. ("TRW") or of a
subsidiary, an option to purchase (AMOUNT) shares of Common Stock, par
value $0.625 each, of TRW ("TRW Common") at an option price of $87.94  per
share.  This option is granted to you pursuant to the
                                  Plan and is subject to the terms and
- ---------------------------------
conditions set forth below.

Date of Grant:  February 7, 1996


This option is not intended to be an incentive stock option as defined in
Section 422A of the Internal Revenue Code.


TRW INC.


By:
   -----------------------------------------
          AUTHORIZED OFFICER


- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------

                              TERMS AND CONDITIONS


1. PURCHASE RIGHTS.
This option cannot be exercised before the first anniversary of the date of
grant.  After that you will be entitled to purchase up to 33-1/3% of the shares
covered by this option, rounded down to the nearest whole share for each of the
first two years, for each full year of your continuous employment with TRW after
the date of grant.  The purchase rights accumulate as shown in the following
table.

<TABLE>

                                   Cumulative Maximum
Number of Full Years               Percentage of
Of Continous Service               Optioned Shares That
After Date of Grant                May Be Purchased
- ---------------------------------------------------------
<S>                                <C>
          1                             33-1/3%
          2                             66-2/3%
          3                             100%
</TABLE>

Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the event of a change in control of TRW, this
option will immediately become exercisable in respect of all of the shares
covered by this grant.  For purposes of this agreement, a change in control is
defined in resolutions adopted by the Compensation and Stock Option Committee of
the Directors of TRW on July 26, 1989, which, in summary, provide that a change
in control is a change occurring (a) by virtue of TRW's merger, consolidation or
reorganization into or with, or transfer of assets to, another corporation or
(b) by virtue of a change in the majority of the Directors of TRW during any
two-year period unless the election of each new Director was approved by a two-
thirds vote of the Directors in office at the beginning of such period or
(c) through the acquisition of shares representing 20% or more of the voting
power of TRW or (d) through any other change in control reported in any filing
with the Securities and Exchange Commission; provided that no change in control
is deemed to have occurred by the acquisition of shares, or any report of such
acquisition, by TRW, a subsidiary of TRW or a TRW-sponsored employee benefit
plan.  The language of the resolutions controls over this summary language.

2. EXERCISE IN WHOLE OR PART.
To the extent this option has become exercisable, you may purchase on any date
or dates all or any part of the shares which you are then entitled to purchase.
However, no fractional shares may be purchased.

3. TERM OF OPTION.
To the extent this option has become exercisable in accordance with paragraph 1
above, it may be exercised by you at any time during the 10-year period
beginning on the date of grant.  To the extent this option remains unexercised
at the end of the 10-year period, your unexercised purchase rights will
terminate.  To the extent unexercised, this stock option will terminate before
the end of such 10-year period in the following cases:

(a) If your employment with TRW terminates before you reach age 55, your
unexercised purchase rights will terminate three months after the date your
employment terminates.

(b) If the Directors of TRW shall find that you intentionally committed an act
materially inimical to the interests of TRW or a subsidiary, your unexercised
purchase rights will terminate as of the time you committed such act, as
determined by the Directors.


<PAGE>


If your employment is terminated by death or disability, your purchase rights
will not be subject to termination under clause (a) above and will continue for
the entire 10-year period.  In the event of a change in control of TRW (as
defined herein), your purchase rights will not under any circumstances be
subject to termination before the end of the 10-year period beginning on the
date of grant.  Nothing contained in this option shall extend this option beyond
a 10-year period beginning on the date of grant or shall limit whatever right
TRW or a subsidiary might otherwise have to terminate your employment at any
time.

4. PAYMENT OF OPTION PRICE.
The option price shall be payable at the time of exercise.  The option price
shall be paid at the Office of Secretary at TRW's corporate headquarters or at
any other place designated by the Secretary.  The option price may be paid in
cash, in full shares of TRW Common, or in a combination of both, in accordance
with such procedures and subject to such further conditions as the Secretary of
TRW may establish from time to time.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, the
Compensation and Stock Option Committee of TRW at any time may suspend or
terminate your right to pay any or all of the option price in shares of TRW
Common.

Cash payments shall be made in United States dollars, except that, if at the
time of exercise you are employed by or on assignment for TRW or a subsidiary at
a location outside the United States, a cash payment may, with the prior
approval of the Secretary of TRW, be made in the official currency used at such
location in an amount specified by the Secretary as equivalent to the same
amount in United States dollars.

Shares delivered in payment of the option price shall be valued at their fair
market value on the date of exercise.  For purposes of this option, "fair market
value" is the mean of the high and low sales prices of a share of TRW Common on
the date of exercise on the New York Stock Exchange Composite Transactions
Listing as reported in the Midwest edition of THE WALL STREET JOURNAL (or if
there are no sales on such date, then the closing sale price on such Listing on
the nearest date before the date of exercise) or such other method or procedure
for determining fair market value as the Compensation and Stock Option Committee
of TRW in its sole discretion may determine.  For purposes of this option, the
"date of exercise" is the date on which written notice, accompanied by the
option price, is received by the Secretary of TRW or his designee that you have
elected to exercise all or part of this option.

5. TAXES.
Upon any exercise of this option, TRW may withhold delivery of certificates for
the purchased shares until you make arrangements satisfactory to TRW to pay any
withholding, transfer or other taxes due as a result of such exercise.  You may
elect, in accordance with applicable regulations of the Compensation and Stock
Option Committee of TRW, to pay a portion or all of the amount of required
withholding taxes in shares of TRW Common, either by delivering to TRW
previously held shares of TRW Common or by having shares of TRW Common withheld
from the shares purchased hereunder.

6. SECURITIES LAWS.
This option shall not be exercisable if such exercise would violate any Federal
or state securities law.  TRW will use its best efforts to make such filings and
initiate such proceedings as may be necessary to prevent such violations unless
the Directors of TRW determine, in their sole discretion, that such filings or
proceedings would result in undue expense or hardship for TRW.  TRW may place
appropriate legends on the certificates for the optioned shares, give stop-
transfer instructions to its transfer agents or take any other action to achieve
compliance with those laws in connection with any exercise of this option or
your resale of the optioned shares.

7. TRANSFERABILITY.
This option is not transferable other than by will or the laws of descent and
distribution and shall be exercisable during your lifetime only by you or your
guardian or legal representative.

8. LEAVES OF ABSENCE.
If you take a leave of absence for illness, military or governmental service or
other reasons, and such leave has been specifically approved by the Chairman of
the Board or the President of TRW for purposes of this option, then such leave
will not be treated as an interruption of your employment.

9. ADJUSTMENTS.
The Compensation and Stock Option Committee of TRW may make such adjustments in
the option price and in the number or kind of shares of TRW Common or other
securities covered by this option as it in its sole discretion may determine are
equitably required to prevent dilution or enlargement of your rights that would
otherwise result from any stock dividend, stock split, combination of shares,
recapitalization or other change in the capital structure of TRW, merger,
consolidation, reorganization, partial or complete liquidation or other
corporate transaction or event having an effect similar to any of the foregoing.

10. CERTAIN DEFINITIONS.
For purposes of this option, employment with a subsidiary will be treated as
equivalent to employment with TRW itself, and your continuous employment will
not be deemed to be interrupted by reason of your transfer among TRW and its
subsidiaries.  "Subsidiary" means a corporation or other entity in an unbroken
chain of entities beginning with TRW if each of the entities other than the last
entity in the unbroken chain owns stock or other ownership interests possessing
50% or more of the total outstanding combined voting power of all classes of
stock or other interests in the next entity in the chain.

11. MISCELLANEOUS.
This stock option is subject to all the terms and conditions of the TRW plan
pursuant to which it is granted.  The Compensation and Stock Option Committee of
TRW has authority to interpret and construe any provision of this instrument and
the TRW plan pursuant to which this stock option is granted, and any such
interpretation and construction shall be binding and conclusive.  Any reference
in this option to the Directors of TRW includes the Executive Committee of the
Directors.

    This AMENDED AND RESTATED EMPLOYMENT CONTINUATION AGREEMENT (this
"Agreement"), is made and entered into on this 7th day of February, 1996, by TRW
INC., an Ohio corporation (the "Company"), and _________________ (the
"Executive").

                                     WITNESSETH:

continuity of management in the event of any Change in Control;

    WHEREAS, the Company wishes to ensure that certain of its executives are
not practically disabled from discharging their duties upon a Change in Control;

its execution, but anything in this Agreement to the contrary notwithstanding,
this Agreement shall not be operative unless and until there shall have occurred
a Change in Control.  For purposes of this Agreement, a "Change in Control"
shall have occurred if at any time during the Term (as that word is hereafter
defined) any of the following events shall occur:

    person immediately after such transaction is held in the aggregate by the
    holders of then-outstanding securities entitled to vote generally in the
    election of Directors ("Voting Stock") of the Company immediately prior to
    such transaction;


                                         -2-

    outstanding Voting Stock of such corporation or person immediately after
    such sale or transfer is held in the aggregate by the holders of Voting
    Stock of the Company immediately prior to such sale or transfer;

                (iii)  There is a report filed on Schedule 13D or Schedule
    14D-1 (or any successor schedule, form or report), each as promulgated
    pursuant to the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the "Exchange Act"),
    disclosing that any person (as the term "person" is used in Section
    13(d)(3) or Section 14(d)(2) of the Exchange Act) has become the beneficial
    owner (as the term "beneficial owner" is defined under Rule 13d-3 or any
    successor rule or regulation promulgated under the Exchange Act) of
    securities representing 20% or more of the then-outstanding Voting Stock of
    the Company;

                (iv)   The Company shall file a report or proxy statement with
    the Securities and Exchange Commission pursuant to the Exchange Act
    disclosing in response to Item 1 of Form 8-K thereunder or Item 6(e) of
    Schedule 14A thereunder (or any successor schedule, form or report or item
    therein) that a change in control of the Company has or may have occurred
    or will or may occur in the future pursuant to any then-existing contract
    or transaction; or

                (v)    During any period of two consecutive years, individuals
         who at the beginning of any such period constitute the Directors of
         the Company cease for any reason to constitute at least a majority
         thereof unless the election, or the nomination for election by the
         Company's shareholders, of each Director of the Company first elected
         during such period was approved by a vote of at least two-thirds of
         the Directors of the Company then still in office who were Directors
         of the Company at the beginning of any such period.

Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of Section 1(a)(iii) and 1(a)(iv)
hereof, a Change in Control shall not be deemed to have occurred for purposes of
this Agreement solely because (A) the Company, (B) an entity in which the
Company directly or indirectly beneficially owns more than 50% of the voting
securities or (C) any Company-sponsored employee stock ownership plan or any
other employee benefit plan of the Company, or any entity holding shares of
Voting Stock for or pursuant to the terms of any such plan, either files or
becomes obligated to file a report or a proxy statement under or in response to
Schedule 13D, Schedule 14D-1, Item 1 of Form 8-K or Item 6(e) of Schedule 14A
(or any successor schedule, form or report or item therein) under the Exchange
Act, disclosing beneficial ownership by it of shares of Voting Stock of the
Company, whether in excess of 20% or otherwise, or because the Company reports
that a change in control of the Company has or may have occurred or will or may
occur in the future by reason of such beneficial ownership by the entities
described in clauses (A), (B) and (C) of this paragraph.


                                         -4-

         (b)    Upon the occurrence of a Change in Control at any time during
the Term, this Agreement shall become immediately operative.

         (c)    The period during which this Agreement shall be in effect (the
"Term") shall commence as of the date hereof and shall expire as of the later of
(i) the close of business on June 1, 2001 or (ii) the expiration of the Period
of Employment (as that term is hereafter defined); provided, however, that
(i) commencing on June 1, 1997 and each June 1 thereafter, the Term of this
Agreement shall automatically be extended for an additional year unless, not
later than January 1 of each such year, the Company or the Executive shall have
given notice that it or he, as the case may be, does not wish to have the Term
extended, and (ii) subject to Section 14 hereof, if, prior to a Change in
Control, the Executive ceases for any reason to be an elected officer or
assistant officer of the Company, thereupon the Term shall be deemed to have
expired and this Agreement shall immediately terminate and have no further
effect.

    2.   Employment; Period of Employment.

         (a)    Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, upon the
occurrence of a Change in Control, the Company shall continue the Executive in
its employ and the Executive shall remain in the employ of the Company for the
period set forth in Section 2(b) below (the "Period of Employment"), with the
duties and responsibilities set forth in Schedule A hereto and any additional
duties and responsibilities that he may have immediately prior to the Change in
Control or to which the Company and the Executive may hereafter mutually agree


                                         -5-

<PAGE>


in writing.  So long as the Executive remains in the employ of the Company, the
Executive shall devote substantially all of his time during normal business
hours (subject to vacations, sick leave and other absences in accordance with
the policies of the Company as in effect for executives immediately prior to the
Change in Control) to the business and affairs of the Company, but nothing in
this Agreement shall preclude the Executive from devoting reasonable periods of
time during normal business hours to (i) serving as a director, trustee or
member of or participant in any organization or business so long as such
activity would not constitute Competitive Activity (as that term is hereafter
defined), (ii) engaging in charitable and community activities or (iii) managing
his personal affairs.

         (b)    The Period of Employment shall commence on the date of the
occurrence of a Change in Control and, subject only to the provisions of Section
4 hereof, shall continue until the earlier of (i) the Executive's death;
(ii) the Executive's attainment of age 65; or (iii) the expiration of the third
anniversary of the occurrence of the Change in Control.

    3.   Compensation During Period of Employment.

         (a)    Upon the occurrence of a Change in Control, the Executive shall
receive during the Period of Employment (i) annual base salary at a rate not
less than the Executive's annual fixed or base compensation as in effect
immediately prior to a Change in Control or such higher rate as may be
determined from time to time by the Company, payable monthly or otherwise as in
effect immediately prior to a Change in Control ("Base Pay") and (ii) an annual
amount equal to not 


                                         -6-

<PAGE>


less than the highest annual aggregate bonuses or incentive payments of
compensation in addition to the amounts referred to in clause (i) above made or
to be made (regardless of when, or in what form, such compensation is paid) for
services rendered in any calendar year during the three calendar years
immediately preceding the year in which a Change in Control occurred pursuant to
any bonus, incentive, profit-sharing or similar policy, plan, program or
arrangement of the Company or any successor thereto ("Incentive Pay"); provided,
however, that nothing herein shall preclude a change in the mix of Base Pay and
Incentive Pay by an increase in the relative amount of Base Pay, provided that
the aggregate compensation received by the Executive in any one year is not
reduced and provided, further, that in no event shall any increase in the
Executive's aggregate compensation or any portion thereof in any way diminish
any other obligation of the Company under this Agreement.  For the purposes of
this Agreement, any compensation the Executive elected to defer under any
policy, plan, program or arrangement shall be included in the determination of
Base Pay and/or Incentive Pay, as applicable.  

         (b)    For his service pursuant to Section 2(a) hereof, during the
Period of Employment the Executive shall be a full participant in any and all
employee retirement income and welfare benefit policies, plans, programs or
arrangements in which executives of the Company participate immediately prior to
the Change in Control or during the Period of Employment, including without
limitation the TRW Salaried Pension Plan ("Retirement Plan"), the TRW
Nonqualified Supplementary Retirement Income Plan ("SRIP"), the TRW Benefits
Equalization Plan 


                                         -7-

<PAGE>

("BEP"), the TRW Employee Stock Ownership and Stock Savings Plan ("ESOSSP"),
the TRW Long-Term Disability Benefits Plan (the "Disability Plan"), the TRW
Deferred Compensation Plan (the "DCP") and any executive automobile, stock 
option, stock purchase, stock appreciation, performance improvement, long-term
incentive, medical or health, life insurance, vacation, disability, salary
continuation and any other retirement income or welfare benefit policy,
plan, program or arrangement or any equivalent successor policy, plan, program
or arrangement that may now exist or be adopted hereafter by the Company or any
successor thereto providing benefits and other perquisites at least as great as
are payable thereunder prior to a Change in Control (collectively, "Employee
Benefits").  If and to the extent that any such Employee Benefits shall not or
cannot be paid or provided under any policy, plan, program or arrangement of the
Company as a result of the amendment or termination thereof, the Company shall
itself pay or provide therefor.  Nothing in this Agreement shall preclude
improvement of reward opportunities in any Employee Benefits, provided that no
such improvement shall in any way diminish any other obligation of the Company
under this Agreement.

    4.   Termination Following a Change in Control.

         (a)    In the event of the occurrence of a Change in Control, this
Agreement may be terminated by the Company during the Period of Employment only
upon the occurrence thereafter of one or more of the following events:

                (i)    If the Executive shall become permanently disabled and
    begins actually to receive disability benefits pursuant 


                                         -8-

<PAGE>


    to the Disability Plan or any successor plan adopted prior to a Change in
    Control; or

                (ii)    For "Cause", which for purposes of this Agreement shall
    mean that, prior to any termination pursuant to Section 4(b) hereof, the
    Executive shall have committed:

                       (A)   an act of fraud, embezzlement or theft in
         connection with his duties or in the course of his employment with the
         Company;

                       (B)   intentional wrongful damage to the property of the
         Company;

                       (C)   intentional wrongful disclosure of secret
         processes or confidential information of the Company; or

                       (D)   intentional wrongful engagement in any Competitive
         Activity (as that term is hereafter defined) while the Executive
         remains in the employ of the Company;

    and any such act shall be determined by the Directors of the Company as
    hereafter provided to have been materially harmful to the Company.  For
    purposes of this Agreement, no act, or failure to act, on the part of the
    Executive shall be deemed for "Cause" unless done, or omitted to be done,
    by the Executive not in good faith and without reasonable belief that his
    action or omission was in the best interest of the Company. 
    Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Executive shall not be deemed to have
    been terminated for "Cause" hereunder unless and until there shall have
    been delivered to the Executive a copy of a resolution duly adopted by the
    affirmative vote of not less than three-quarters of the Direc-


                                         -9-

<PAGE>


    tors then in office at a meeting of the Directors called and held for such
    purpose (after reasonable notice to the Executive and an opportunity for
    the Executive, together with his counsel, to be heard before the
    Directors), finding that, in the good faith opinion of the Directors, the
    Executive had committed an act set forth above in this Section 4(a)(ii) and
    specifying the particulars thereof in detail.  Nothing herein shall limit
    the right of the Executive or his beneficiaries to contest the validity or
    propriety of any such determination.

         (b)    In the event of the occurrence of a Change in Control, this
Agreement may be terminated by the Executive with the right to receive benefits
under Section 5 hereof and, if applicable, Section 6 hereof, only upon the
occurrence thereafter of one or more of the following events:

                (i)    Any termination by the Company of the employment of the
    Executive during the Period of Employment, unless (x) Cause for termination
    shall exist or (y) as a result of the death of the Executive or (z) by
    reason of the Executive's disability and the actual receipt of disability
    benefits as provided in Section 4(a)(i) hereof; or

                (ii)   Termination by the Executive of his employment with the
    Company during the Period of Employment and upon the occurrence of any of
    the following events:

                       (A)   Failure to elect, reelect or otherwise maintain
         the Executive in the office or position in the Company which the
         Executive held immediately prior to a 


                                         -10-

<PAGE>


         Change in Control, or the removal of the Executive as a Director of
         the Company (or any successor thereof) if the Executive shall have
         been a Director of the Company immediately prior to the Change in
         Control;

                       (B)   A significant adverse change in the nature or
         scope of the authorities, powers, functions, responsibilities or
         duties in respect of the Company which the Executive had immediately
         prior to the Change in Control, a reduction in the aggregate of the
         Executive's Base Pay and Incentive Pay received from the Company, or
         the termination of the Executive's rights to Employee Benefits to
         which he was entitled immediately prior to the Change in Control or a
         reduction in scope or value thereof without the prior written consent
         of the Executive, any of which is not remedied within 10 calendar days
         after receipt by the Company of written notice from the Executive of
         such change, reduction or termination, as the case may be;

                       (C)   A determination by the Executive (which
         determination will be conclusive and binding upon the parties hereto
         provided it has been made in good faith and in all events will be
         presumed to have been made in good faith unless otherwise shown by the
         Company by clear and convincing evidence) that a change in
         circumstances has occurred significantly affecting his position,
         including without limitation a change in the scope of the business or
         other activities for which he was responsible or a substantial 


                                         -11-

<PAGE>


         reduction in any of the resources available to carry out any of the
         authorities, powers, functions, responsibilities or duties that he had
         immediately prior to the Change in Control, has been rendered
         substantially unable to carry out, has been substantially hindered in
         the performance of or has suffered a substantial reduction in any of
         such authorities, powers, functions, responsibilities or duties, which
         situation is not remedied within 10 calendar days after receipt by the
         Company of written notice from the Executive of such determination;

                       (D)   The liquidation, dissolution, merger,
         consolidation or reorganization of the Company or transfer of all or a
         significant portion of its business and/or assets unless the successor
         or successors (by liquidation, merger, consolidation, reorganization
         or otherwise) to which all or a significant portion of its business
         and/or assets have been transferred (directly or by operation of law)
         shall have assumed all duties and obligations of the Company under
         this Agreement pursuant to Section 8 hereof;

                       (E)   The relocation of the Company's principal
         executive offices or the requirement by the Company that the Executive
         change his principal location of work to any location which is in
         excess of 35 miles from his principal location immediately prior to
         the Change in Control or travel away from his office in the course of
         discharging his responsibilities or duties hereunder more than 20
         consecutive cal-


                                         -12-

<PAGE>


         endar days or an aggregate of more than 30 calendar days in any
         consecutive 90 calendar-day period without in either case his prior
         written consent; or

                       (F)   Without limiting the generality or effect of the
         foregoing, any material breach of this Agreement by the Company.  

The Executive's continued employment shall constitute consent to, and a waiver
of rights with respect to, any event described in this Section 4(b)(ii) unless
the Executive terminates his employment with the Company within 120 days after
the Executive has actual knowledge of the occurrence of an event described in
this Section 4(b)(ii) that is not remedied as provided herein.  The parties
agree that any consent to or waiver of any such event shall not be deemed to
constitute a consent to or waiver of any other circumstance constituting an
event described in this Section 4(b)(ii).

         (c)    Notwithstanding anything contained in this Agreement to the
contrary, in the event of a Change in Control, the Executive may terminate
employment with the Company for any reason, or without reason, during the 60-day
period immediately following the first anniversary of the first occurrence of a
Change in Control, with the right to severance compensation as provided in
Section 5 hereof and, if applicable, Section 6 hereof.

         (d)    A termination by the Company pursuant to Section 4(a) hereof or
by the Executive pursuant to Section 4(b) or Section 4(c) hereof shall not
affect any rights which the Executive may have pursuant to any other agreement,
policy, plan, program or


                                         -13-

<PAGE>


arrangement of the Company providing Employee Benefits, which rights shall be
governed by the terms thereof; provided, however, that if the Executive shall
have received or shall be receiving benefits under Section 5 hereof and, if
applicable, Section 6 hereof, the Executive shall not be entitled to receive
benefits under any other policy, plan, program or arrangement of the Company
providing severance compensation to which the Executive would otherwise be
entitled.  If this Agreement or the employment of the Executive is terminated
under circumstances in which the Executive is not entitled to any payments under
Sections 3 or 5 hereof, the Executive shall have no further obligation or
liability to the Company hereunder with respect to his prior or any future
employment by the Company.

         (e)    The Company shall provide the Executive with timely notice of
any of the events referred to in Section 4(b)(ii)(D) hereof so that a
determination can be made as to the assumption of duties and obligations by any
successor or successors.

    5.   Severance Compensation.

         (a)    If, following the occurrence of a Change in Control, the
Company shall terminate the Executive's employment other than pursuant to
Section 4(a) hereof, or if the Executive shall terminate his employment pursuant
to Section 4(b) or Section 4(c) hereof:

                (i)    The Company shall pay or cause to be paid to the
    Executive, within five business days after the effective date of any such
    termination (the "Termination Date"), in lieu of any further payments to
    the Executive for the portion of the Period of Employment subsequent to the
    Termination Date, but without 


                                         -14-

<PAGE>


    affecting the rights of the Executive referred to in Section 5(b) hereof
    and the Executive's rights at law or in equity (other than rights to
    damages for termination of his employment or this Agreement), a lump sum
    severance payment (the "Severance Payment") equal to the present value
    (using a discount rate equal to the applicable interest rate promulgated by
    the Internal Revenue Service "IRS" under Section 417(e)(3) of the Code for
    the third month preceding the month in which the Termination Date occurs,
    and if the IRS ceases to promulgate such interest rates, the last such
    interest rate so promulgated) of the sum of (A) the aggregate Base Pay (at
    the highest rate in effect at any time during the Period of Employment or
    immediately prior to the Change in Control) which the Executive would have
    received pursuant to this Agreement for (x) each remaining year or fraction
    thereof during the Period of Employment or (y) two years, whichever is the
    longer period, had his employment with the Company continued for the longer
    of such periods; plus (B) the aggregate Incentive Pay (based upon the
    highest annual aggregate Incentive Pay that the Executive received with
    respect to any calendar year during the three calendar years immediately
    preceding the calendar year in which the Change in Control occurred or the
    Incentive Pay that the Executive received with respect to the calendar year
    preceding the calendar year in which the Termination Date occurs, whichever
    is the larger amount) which the Executive would have received pursuant to
    this Agreement with respect to (x) each remaining year or fraction thereof
    during the Period of Employ-


                                         -15-

<PAGE>


    ment or (y) two years, whichever is the longer period, had his employment
    with the Company continued for the longer of such periods; plus (C) the
    cash value of all Employee Benefits, other than stock option, stock
    purchase, stock appreciation or similar compensatory benefits (based upon
    the highest annual aggregate rate that the Executive received Employee
    Benefits with respect to any calendar year during the three calendar years
    immediately preceding the calendar year in which the Change in Control
    occurred or the Employee Benefits that the Executive received with respect
    to the calendar year preceding the calendar year in which the Termination
    Date occurs, whichever is the larger amount), which the Executive would
    have received pursuant to this Agreement with respect to (x) each remaining
    year or fraction thereof during the Period of Employment or (y) two years,
    whichever is the longer period, had his employment with the Company 
    continued for the longer of such periods, other than Employee Benefits 
    providing Base Pay, Incentive Pay and the Employee Benefits to be provided
    pursuant to Sections 5(a)(ii) and 5(a)(iv) hereof;

         (ii)   The Company shall pay or cause to be paid to the Executive,
within five business days after the Termination Date, a lump sum payment equal
to the sum of the following:

         (A)    The present value of the benefit that would be payable to the
    Executive from the SRIP and the Defined Benefit Portion of the BEP (as such
    term is used therein), commencing at the earliest time permissible under
    the SRIP and the BEP, assuming, 


                                         -16-

<PAGE>


    solely for the purposes of the SRIP and the BEP (but not for purposes of
    the Retirement Plan), that (I) the SRIP and the BEP contained no vesting
    requirements, (II) the Executive was credited with additional service with
    the Company equal to the remaining Period of Employment or two years,
    whichever is the longer period, (III) the Executive's age was increased an
    amount equal to the remaining Period of Employment or two years, whichever
    is the longer period, and (IV) the Executive's final average compensation
    was determined by including the compensation that would have been paid to
    the Executive for a period equal to the remaining Period of Employment or
    two years, whichever is the longer period, had his employment with the
    Company continued for the longer of such periods, if the Executive's annual
    compensation for such period was the sum of the amounts described in
    Sections 5(a)(i)(A) and 5(a)(i)(B), such present value to be determined
    using the applicable mortality table promulgated by the IRS under
    Section 417(e)(3) of the Code in effect on the Termination Date and the
    applicable interest rate promulgated by the IRS under Section 417(e)(3) of
    the Code for the third month preceding the month in which the Termination
    Date occurs, and if the IRS ceases to promulgate such interest rates, the
    last such interest rate so promulgated.  The Executive hereby waives, in
    consideration of, and subject to receipt of, the payment contemplated by
    this Section 5(ii)(A), any payments under the provisions of the SRIP and
    the Defined Benefit Portion of the BEP.


                                         -17-

<PAGE>


         (B)    The amount credited to the Executive's Account (as such term is
    defined in the BEP) under the defined contribution portion of the BEP.  The
    Executive hereby waives, in consideration of, and subject to receipt of,
    the payment contemplated by this Section 5(ii)(B), any payments under the
    provisions of the defined contribution portion of the BEP.

         (C)    The amount of TRW Matching Contributions (as such term is
    defined in the ESOSSP) that would have been contributed to the ESOSSP on
    behalf of the Executive for the remaining Period of Employment or two
    years, whichever is the longer period, had his employment with the Company
    continued for the longer of such periods, if (I) the Executive's employment
    had not been terminated, (II) the Executive had received Base Pay and
    Incentive Pay during such period at the rates or in the amounts described
    in Section 5(a)(i) hereof, (III) the ESOSSP did not contain provisions
    implementing the requirements of Sections 401(a)(4), 401(a)(17), 401(k),
    401(m), 402(g), and 415 of the Code or any other provisions of the Code
    limiting the amount of contributions that may be made to the ESOSSP by or
    on behalf of the Executive and (IV) the Executive had elected to contribute
    the maximum amount of Before-Tax Contributions (as such term is defined in
    the ESOSSP) permitted to be contributed to the ESOSSP for such period.

         (D)    The amounts (including interest through the Termination Date)
    credited to the Executive's Account (as such term is defined in the DCP). 
    The Executive acknowledges that the Execu-


                                         -18-

<PAGE>


    tive's receipt of the payment contemplated by this Section 5(ii)(D) shall
    discharge the Company's obligations to the Executive under the DCP.

The Executive and the Company acknowledge that references in this Section
5(a)(ii) to the Retirement Plan, the ESOSSP, the BEP, the SRIP and the DCP shall
be deemed to be references to such plans as amended or restated from time to
time and to any similar plan of the Company that supplements or supersedes any
such plans; provided that any amendment following a Change in Control that
reduces benefits under the Retirement Plan, the ESOSSP, the BEP, the SRIP or the
DCP (or any similar plan of the Company that supplements or supersedes any of
such plans) in any way (including without limitation by reducing the rate of
benefit accruals or contribution levels under any of such plans, or by changing
the basis upon which actuarial equivalents are determined under any such plans)
shall be disregarded for purposes of this Section 5(a)(ii).  In addition, the
Executive and the Company acknowledge that references in this Section 5 to any
Section of the Code shall be deemed to be references to such Section as amended
from time to time or to any successor thereto.  

         (iii)  The Company shall pay all legal fees and expenses incurred by
the Executive as a result of such termination (including without limitation all
such fees and expenses, if any, incurred in seeking to obtain or enforce any
right or benefit provided by this Agreement in accordance with Section 17
hereof); and

         (iv)   The Company shall arrange to provide to the Executive, for the
remainder of the Period of Employment or two years,


                                         -19-

<PAGE>


whichever is the longer period, with Employee Benefits that are welfare benefits
(and not stock option, stock purchase, stock appreciation or similar
compensatory benefits) which the Executive was receiving or entitled to receive
during the Period of Employment.  If and to the extent that any such Employee
Benefits shall not or cannot be paid or provided under any policy, plan, program
or arrangement of the Company (i) solely due to the fact that the Executive is
no longer an officer or employee of the Company or did not continue as an
officer or employee of the Company during the remainder of the Period of
Employment or (ii) as a result of the amendment or termination of any such
Employee Benefit, the Company shall itself pay or provide for the payment of
such Employee Benefits to the Executive, his dependents and beneficiaries. 
Without otherwise limiting the purposes or effect of Section 7 hereof, Employee
Benefits payable to the Executive (including his dependents and beneficiaries)
pursuant to this Section 5(a)(iii) by reason of any "welfare benefit plan" of
the Company (as the term "welfare benefit plan" is defined in Section 3(1) of
the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, as amended) shall be
reduced to the extent comparable welfare benefits are actually received by the
Executive (including his dependents and beneficiaries) from another employer
during such period, and any such benefits actually received by the Executive
shall be reported by the Executive to the Company.

         (b)    Any Incentive Pay that is payable to the Executive with respect
to a period that is less than a full calendar year (a "partial calendar year")
shall be prorated by multiplying (i) the Incentive Pay that would have been
payable to the Executive with respect to the 


                                         -20-

<PAGE>


entire calendar year had the Executive's employment with the Company continued
until the end of such year by (ii) a fraction, the numerator of which equals the
number of days in the partial calendar year and the denominator of which equals
365.

         (c)    There shall be no right of set-off or counterclaim in respect
of any claim, debt or obligation against any payment to or benefit for the
Executive provided for in this Agreement.

         (d)    Without limiting the rights of the Executive at law or in
equity, if the Company fails to make any payment or provide any benefit required
to be made or provided hereunder on a timely basis, the Company will pay
interest on the amount or value thereof at an annualized rate of interest equal
to the so-called composite "prime rate" as quoted from time to time during the
relevant period in the Northeast Edition of THE WALL STREET JOURNAL, plus three
percent.  Such interest will be payable as it accrues on demand.  Any change in
such prime rate will be effective on and as of the date of such change.

         (e)    In the event a Change in Control occurs, the Company shall
deposit in trust, pursuant to certain trust agreements to which the Company
shall be a party, cash or other property in such an amount as necessary to
assure the payment of the amounts due to the Executive under this Agreement. 
Any failure by the Company to satisfy any of its obligations under this
Section 5(e) shall not limit the rights of the Executive hereunder. 
Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Executive shall have the status of a general
unsecured creditor of the Company and shall have no right to, or security
interest in, any assets of the Company.

                                          21

    6.   Certain Additional Payments by the Company.

         (a)    Anything in this Agreement to the contrary notwithstanding, in
the event that this Agreement shall become operative and it shall be determined
(as hereafter provided) that any payment or distribution by the Company to or
for the benefit of the Executive, whether paid or payable or distributed or
distributable pursuant to the terms of this Agreement or otherwise (a
"Payment"), would be subject to the excise tax imposed by Section 4999 (or any
successor thereto) of the Code, or any interest or penalties with respect to
such excise tax (such excise tax, together with any such interest and penalties,
are hereafter collectively referred to as the "Excise Tax"), then the Executive
shall be entitled to receive an additional payment or payments (collectively, a
"Gross-Up Payment"); provided, however, that no Gross-Up Payment shall be made
with respect to the Excise Tax, if any, attributable to (i) any incentive stock
option, as defined by Section 422 of the Code ("ISO") granted prior to the
execution of this Agreement, or (ii) any stock appreciation or similar right,
whether or not limited, granted in tandem with any ISO described in clause (i). 
The Gross-Up Payment shall be in an amount such that, after payment by the
Executive of all taxes (including any interest or penalties imposed with respect
to such taxes), including any Excise Tax imposed upon the Gross-Up Payment, the
Executive retains an amount of the Gross-Up Payment equal to the Excise Tax
imposed upon the Payment.

         (b)    Subject to the provisions of Section 6(e) hereof, all
determinations required to be made under this Section 6, including whether an
Excise Tax is payable by the Executive and the amount of 



                                         -22-

<PAGE>


such Excise Tax and whether a Gross-Up Payment is required and the amount of
such Gross-Up Payment, shall be made by a nationally recognized firm of
certified public accountants (the "Accounting Firm") selected by the Executive
in his sole discretion.  The Executive shall direct the Accounting Firm to
submit its determination and detailed supporting calculations to both the
Company and the Executive within 15 calendar days after the Termination Date, if
applicable, or such earlier time or times as may be requested by the Company or
the Executive.  If the Accounting Firm determines that any Excise Tax is payable
by the Executive, the Company shall pay the required Gross-Up Payment to the
Executive within five business days after receipt of the aforesaid determination
and calculations.  If the Accounting Firm determines that no Excise Tax is
payable by the Executive, it shall, at the same time as it makes such
determination, furnish the Executive with an opinion that he has substantial
authority not to report any Excise Tax on his federal income tax return.  Any
determination by the Accounting Firm as to the amount of the Gross-Up Payment to
be paid by the Company within such 15 calendar-day period shall be binding upon
the Company and the Executive.  As a result of the uncertainty in the
application of Section 4999 (or any successor thereto) of the Code at the time
of the initial determination by the Accounting Firm hereunder, it is possible
that Gross-Up Payments which will not have been made by the Company should have
been made ("Underpayment"), consistent with the calculations required to be made
hereunder.  In the event that the Company exhausts its remedies pursuant to
Section 6(e) thereof and the Executive thereafter is required to make a payment
of any Excise Tax, 


                                         -23-

<PAGE>


the Executive shall direct the Accounting Firm to determine the amount of the
Underpayment that has occurred and to submit its determination and detailed
supporting calculations to both the Company and the Executive as promptly as
possible.  Any such Underpayment shall be promptly paid by the Company to or for
the benefit of the Executive within three calendar days after receipt of such
determination and calculations.

         (c)    The Company and the Executive shall each cooperate with the
Accounting Firm in connection with the preparation and issuance of the
determination provided for in Section 6(b) hereof.  Such cooperation shall
include without limitation providing the Accounting Firm access to and copies of
any books, records and documents in the possession of the Company or the
Executive, as the case may be, that are reasonably requested by the Accounting
Firm.

         (d)    The fees and expenses of the Accounting Firm for its services
in connection with the determinations and calculations provided for in Section
6(b) hereof shall be paid by the Executive.  The Company shall reimburse the
Executive for his payment of such costs and expenses within five business days
after receipt from the Executive of a statement therefor and evidence of his
payment thereof.

         (e)    The Executive shall notify the Company in writing of any claim
by the Internal Revenue Service that, if successful, would require the payment
by the Company of a Gross-Up Payment.  Such notification shall be given as soon
as practicable but no later than 10 business days after the Executive receives
notice of such claim and shall apprise the Company of the nature of such claim
and the date on which 


                                         -24-

<PAGE>


such claim is requested to be paid.  The Executive shall not pay such claim
prior to the earlier of (i) the expiration of the 30 calendar-day period
following the date on which it gives such notice to the Company or (ii) the date
that any payment of taxes with respect to such claim is due.  If the Company
notifies the Executive in writing prior to the expiration of such period that it
desires to contest such claim, the Executive shall:

              (i)    give the Company any information reasonably requested by
    the Company relating to such claim;

              (ii)   take such action in connection with contesting such claim
    as the Company shall reasonably request in writing from time to time,
    including without limitation accepting legal representation with respect to
    such claim by an attorney reasonably selected by the Company;

              (iii)  cooperate with the Company in good faith in order
    effectively to contest such claim; and

              (iv)   permit the Company to participate in any proceedings
    relating to such claim;

provided, however, that the Company shall bear and pay directly all costs and
expenses (including additional interest and penalties) incurred in connection
with such contest and shall indemnify and hold the Executive harmless, on an
after-tax basis, for any Excise Tax or income tax, including interest and
penalties with respect thereto, imposed as a result of such representation and
payment of costs and expenses.  Without limitation on the foregoing provisions
of this Section 6(e), the Company shall control all proceedings taken in
connection with such contest 


                                         -25-

<PAGE>


and, at its sole option, may pursue or forego any and all administrative
appeals, proceedings, hearings and conference with the taxing authority in
respect of such claim (but the Executive may participate therein at his own cost
and expense) and may, at its sole option, either direct the Executive to pay the
tax claimed and sue for a refund or contest the claim in any permissible manner,
and the Executive agrees to prosecute such contest to a determination before any
administrative tribunal, in a court of initial jurisdiction and in one or more
appellate courts, as the Company shall determine; provided, however, that if the
Company directs the Executive to pay the tax claimed and sue for a refund, the
Company shall advance the amount of such payment to the Executive on an
interest-free basis and shall indemnify and hold the Executive harmless, on an
after-tax basis, from any Excise Tax or income tax, including interest or
penalties with respect thereto, imposed with respect to such advance or with
respect to any imputed income with respect to such advance; and further provided
that any extension of the statute of limitations relating to payment of taxes
for the taxable year of the Executive with respect to which the contested amount
is claimed to be due is limited solely to such contested amount.  Furthermore,
the Company's control of such contest shall be limited to issues with respect to
which a Gross-Up Payment would be payable hereunder, and the Executive shall be
entitled to settle or contest, as the case may be, any other issue raised by the
Internal Revenue Service or any other taxing authority.

         (f)    If, after the receipt by the Executive of an amount advanced by
the Company pursuant to Section 6(e) hereof, the Execu-


                                         -26-

<PAGE>


tive receives any refund with respect to such claim, the Executive shall
(subject to the Company's complying with the requirements of Section 6(e)
hereof) promptly pay to the Company the amount of such refund (together with any
interest paid or credited thereon after any taxes applicable thereto).  If,
after the receipt by the Executive of an amount advanced by the Company pursuant
to Section 6(e) hereof, a determination is made that the Executive shall not be
entitled to any refund with respect to such claim and the Company does not
notify the Executive in writing of its intent to contest such denial or refund
prior to the expiration of 30 calendar days after such determination, then such
advance shall be forgiven and shall not be required to be repaid and the amount
of such advance shall offset, to the extent thereof, the amount of Gross-Up
Payment required to be paid.

    7.   No Mitigation Obligation.  The Company hereby acknowledges that it
will be difficult, and may be impossible, for the Executive to find reasonably
comparable employment following the Termination Date.  In addition, the Company
acknowledges that its severance pay plans and policies applicable in general to
its salaried employees do not provide for mitigation, offset or reduction of any
severance payment received thereunder.  Accordingly, the parties hereto
expressly agree that the payment of the severance compensation by the Company to
the Executive in accordance with the terms of this Agreement shall be liquidated
damages and that the Executive shall not be required to mitigate the amount of
any payment provided for in this Agreement by seeking other employment or
otherwise, nor shall any profits, income, earnings or other benefits from any
source whatsoever create any miti-


                                         -27-

<PAGE>


gation, offset, reduction or any other obligation on the part of the Executive
hereunder or otherwise, except as expressly provided in Section 5(a)(iv) hereof.

    8.   Successors and Binding Agreement.

         (a)    The Company shall require any successor (whether direct or
indirect, by purchase, merger, consolidation, reorganization or otherwise) to
all or substantially all of the business and/or assets of the Company, by
agreement in form and substance satisfactory to the Executive, expressly to
assume and agree to perform this Agreement and each of the Company's obligations
hereunder.  This Agreement shall be binding upon and inure to the benefit of the
Company and any successor of or to the Company, including without limitation any
persons acquiring directly or indirectly all or substantially all of the
business and/or assets of the Company whether by purchase, merger,
consolidation, reorganization or otherwise (and such successor shall thereafter
be deemed the "Company" for the purposes of this Agreement), but shall not
otherwise be assignable or delegable by the Company.

         (b)    This Agreement shall insure to the benefit of and be
enforceable by the Executive's personal or legal representatives, executors,
administrators, successors, heirs, distributees and/or legatees.

         (c)    This Agreement is personal in nature and neither of the parties
hereto shall, without the consent of the other, assign, transfer or delegate
this Agreement or any rights or obligations hereunder except as expressly
provided in Section 8(a) hereof.  Without limiting the generality of the
foregoing, the Executive's right to receive payments hereunder shall not be
assignable or transferable, whether by 


                                         -28-

<PAGE>


pledge, creation of a security interest or otherwise, other than by a transfer
by his will or by the laws of descent and distribution and, in the event of any
attempted assignment or transfer contrary to this Section 8(c), the Company
shall have no liability to pay to the purported assignee or transferee any
amount so attempted to be assigned or transferred.


         (d)    The Company and the Executive recognize that each party will
have no adequate remedy at law for any material breach by the other of any of
the agreements contained herein and, in the event of any such breach, the
Company and the Executive hereby agree and consent that the other shall be
entitled to a decree of specific performance, mandamus or other appropriate
remedy to enforce performance of this Agreement.

    9.   Notice.  For all purposes of this Agreement, all communications
provided for herein shall be in writing and shall be deemed to have been duly
given when delivered or five business days after having been mailed by United
States registered or certified mail, return receipt requested, postage prepaid,
addressed to the Company (to the attention of the Secretary of the Company) at
its principal executive office and to the Executive at his principal residence,
or to such other address as any party may have furnished to the other in writing
and in accordance herewith, except that notices of change of address shall be
effective only upon receipt.

    10.  Governing Law.  The validity, interpretation, construction and
performance of this Agreement shall be governed by the laws of 


                                         -29-

<PAGE>


the State of Ohio, without giving effect to the principles of conflict of laws
of such State.

    11.  Miscellaneous.  No provisions of this Agreement may be modified,
waived or discharged unless such waiver, modification or discharge is agreed to
in writing signed by the Executive and the Company.  No waiver by either party
hereto at any time of any breach by the other party hereto or compliance with
any condition or provision of this Agreement to be performed by such other party
shall be deemed a waiver of similar or dissimilar provisions or conditions at
the same or at any prior or subsequent time.  No agreements or representations,
oral or otherwise, expressed or implied with respect to the subject matter
hereof have been made by either party which are not set forth expressly in this
Agreement.

    12.  Validity.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any provision of this
Agreement shall not affect the validity or enforceability of any other provision
of this Agreement which shall remain in full force and effect.

    13.  Counterparts.  This Agreement may be executed in one or more
counterparts, each of which shall be deemed to be an original but all of which
together shall constitute one and the same agreement.

    14.  Employment Rights.  Nothing expressed or implied in this Agreement
shall create any right or duty on the part of the Company or the Executive to
have the Executive continue as an officer or assistant officer of the Company or
to remain in the employment of the Company prior to any Change in Control;
provided, however, that any termination of employment of the Executive or
removal of the Executive as an 


                                         -30-

<PAGE>


elected officer or assistant officer of the Company following the commencement
of any discussion with or communication from a third person that ultimately
results in a Change in Control shall be deemed to be a termination or removal of
the Executive after a Change in Control for purposes of this Agreement.


    15.  Withholding of Taxes.  The Company may withhold from any amounts
payable under this Agreement all federal, state, city or other taxes as shall be
required pursuant to any law or government regulation or ruling.

    16.  Competitive Activity.  For purposes of this Agreement, the term
"Competitive Activity" shall mean the Executive's participation, without the
written consent of an officer of the Company, in the management of any business
enterprise if such enterprise engages in substantial and direct competition with
the Company and such enterprise's sales of any product or service competitive
with any product or service of the Company amounted to 25% of such enterprise's
net sales for its most recently completed fiscal year and if the Company's net
sales of said product or service amounted to 25% of the Company's net sales for
its most recently completed fiscal year.  "Competitive Activity" shall not
include (i) the mere ownership of securities in any enterprise and exercise of
rights appurtenant thereto or (ii) participation in management of any enterprise
or business operation thereof other than in connection with the competitive
operation of such enterprise.

    17.  Legal Fees and Expenses.  It is the intent of the Company that the
Executive not be required to incur the expenses associated with the enforcement
of his rights under this Agreement by litigation or 


                                         -31-

<PAGE>


other legal action because the cost and expense thereof would substantially
detract from the benefits intended to be extended to the Executive hereunder. 
Accordingly, if it should appear to the Executive that the Company has failed to
comply with any of its obligations under this Agreement or in the event that the
Company or any other person takes any action to declare the Agreement void or
unenforceable or institutes any litigation designed to deny, or to recover from
the Executive the benefits intended to be provided to the Executive hereunder,
the Company irrevocably authorizes the Executive from time to time to retain
counsel of his choice, at the expense of the Company as hereafter provided, to
represent the Executive in connection with the initiation or defense of any
litigation or other legal action relating thereto, whether by or against the
Company or any Director, officer, shareholder or other person affiliated with
the Company, in any jurisdiction.  Notwithstanding any existing or prior
attorney-client relationship between the Company and any such counsel, the
Company irrevocably consents to the Executive's entering into an attorney-client
relationship with such counsel, and in that connection the Company and the
Executive agree that a confidential relationship shall exist between the
Executive and such counsel.  The Company shall pay or cause to be paid and be
solely responsible for any and all attorneys' and related fees and expenses
incurred by the Executive (i) as a result of the Company's failure to perform
this Agreement or any provision hereof or (ii) as a result of the Company or any
person contesting the validity or enforceability of this Agreement or any
provision hereof as aforesaid.


                                         -32-

    18.  Prior Agreement.  This Agreement amends and restates in its entirety
the Employment Continuation Agreement, dated _____________, 19__ between the
Company and the Executive.

    IN WITNESS WHEREOF, the parties have caused this Agreement to be duly
executed and delivered as of the date first set forth above.

                                 TERMS AND CONDITIONS


                             I.  CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION

     The term "TRW Confidential Information" refers to all data, reports,
drawings, tapes, formulas, interpretations, forecasts, business plans and
analyses, records, trade secrets, customer lists, documents, proposals,
information regarding products, pricing, terms of sale, processes, research and
development, apparatus and application methods and all other information
reflecting upon or concerning TRW Inc., its subsidiaries or affiliates
(hereinafter referred to as "TRW") that TRW protects against unrestricted
disclosure to others, are not openly communicated or made accessible by TRW to
third parties and that Consultant obtains from TRW, its employees, subsidiaries
or affiliates, or otherwise acquires while engaged hereunder, including
information of a third party as to which TRW has a nondisclosure obligation.
Additionally, TRW Confidential Information will include any and all reports to
TRW made by Contractor hereunder or the contents thereof.  In view of the
sensitive information to which Consultant will have access during Consultant's
engagement hereunder, any information reflecting upon or concerning TRW and
known, communicated or accessible to Consultant shall be deemed to be TRW
Confidential Information unless such information has been published by TRW in
publicly available documents.

     Such TRW Confidential Information includes, but is not limited to, secret
or confidential matters (a) of a technical nature, (b) of a business nature and
(c) of either nature pertaining to future development.  Consultant:

     (a)  agrees that TRW Confidential Information is the sole property of TRW
          and that such TRW Confidential Information shall be used only in
          providing consulting services hereunder for TRW;

     (b)  will hold the TRW Confidential Information in confidence and not
          disclose it in any manner whatsoever, in whole or in part, to any
          person except to employees of TRW, or to employees, subcontractors or
          representatives of Consultant who need to know in order to perform
          their duties and who agree in writing to use the Confidential
          Information only to assist Consultant in performance of Consultant's
          duties hereunder;

     (c)  will take or cause to be taken all reasonable precautions to prevent
          the disclosure or communication of TRW Confidential Information to
          third parties;

 
                                                              Initialed PSH/COM

                                         -3-

     (d)  agrees that each reproduction, duplication, or copy of any portion of
          TRW Confidential Information will be deemed TRW Confidential
          Information for all purposes hereunder; and

     (e)  will, upon expiration or termination of the Agreement, discontinue all
          use of TRW Confidential Information and return all documents
          containing TRW Confidential Information to TRW.

     In the event that Consultant or its employees, subcontractors, or
representatives receives a request to disclose all or any part of the TRW
Confidential Information under the terms of a valid and effective subpoena or
order issued by a court of competent jurisdiction or by a governmental body,
Consultant shall

     1.   As soon as possible upon receipt, notify TRW of the existence, terms
          and circumstances surrounding such a request, so that it may seek an
          appropriate protective order and/or waive Consultant's compliance with
          the provisions of this Agreement; and

     2.   If disclosure of such TRW Confidential Information is required in the
          opinion of Consultant's counsel, cooperate with TRW in obtaining
          reliable assurances that confidential treatment will be accorded to
          the disclosed TRW Confidential Information.


                                   II.  INVENTIONS

     Consultant shall disclose promptly to TRW all ideas, inventions,
discoveries or improvements, whether or not patentable, which were or are
conceived or first reduced to practice by Consultant, whether solely or jointly
with employees of TRW, its subsidiaries or affiliates, in the course of
performing work hereunder or as a result of knowledge acquired while performing
services under this Agreement ("TRW Inventions").  Consultant agrees that all
TRW Inventions shall be the sole property of TRW.  During and subsequent to the
term of this Agreement, Consultant will execute and deliver to TRW all documents
and take such other action as may be reasonably required by TRW to assist TRW in
obtaining patents in the United States and foreign countries and in vesting
title thereto in TRW for said TRW Inventions.  At TRW's request and expense,
Consultant shall cooperate with TRW and do all things reasonably and lawfully
appropriate to assist TRW, or its successors, assigns and nominees, to obtain
and enforce patents relating to such TRW Inventions.

                                   III.  COPYRIGHTS

     Neither Consultant nor any of Consultant's employees or independent
contractors shall knowingly incorporate in any work prepared under this
Agreement any copyrighted or proprietary material of TRW or any other person.
Further, any work of authorship created under this Agreement shall constitute a
"work made for hire", when so defined by the Copyright Act, and as to any work
not so defined, Consultant hereby transfers, and shall cause its employees to

                                     IV.  LICENSE

     TRW shall advise Consultant which information or items provided to
Consultant constitute classified material, and Consultant shall comply with all
security requirements imposed by the United States Government or TRW.  If it
becomes necessary for Consultant to store classified material at Consultant's
place of work, other than TRW premises, a facility clearance shall be required.
In that event, Consultant shall enter into a security agreement with the
applicable Government agency and maintain a system of security controls in
accordance with such security agreement.  All such classified material shall be
promptly returned to TRW on request or upon termination of the security
agreement or this Agreement, whichever first occurs.


                                   VI.  NO CONFLICT

     Except with the prior written approval of TRW after full disclosure of all
relevant facts, Consultant shall refrain from accepting work, engagements or
appointments from any third party which could conflict with, or impede an
unbiased performance of, Consultant's work hereunder or the protection of TRW
Confidential Information.


                                   VII.  COMPLIANCE

     Consultant warrants that Consultant has the right to enter into this
Agreement and that performance of the work specified shall not cause Consultant
to be in violation of any federal, state or local law or regulation, or any

                                                              Intitaled PSH/COM

with TRW's policies, directives and standards, including without limitation
TRW's standards regarding legal and ethical conduct and government contracting
and with all applicable federal, state and local laws and regulations.
Consultant shall file all tax returns and reports required to be filed pursuant
to law.

                                  VIII.  TERMINATION

     This Agreement may be terminated by TRW or Consultant in whole or in part
upon 15 days' prior written notice.  This Agreement will terminate forthwith
upon receipt of written notice from TRW if Consultant is unable to perform
Consultant's duties hereunder for a period of thirty consecutive days.  Payment
shall be made for services and expenses rendered or incurred through the date of
termination.  Advance payments shall be prorated through the termination date.
The covenants set forth in these Terms and Conditions shall survive the
termination of this Agreement.


                                  IX.  FORCE MAJEURE

     Neither party shall incur liability to the other party on account of any
loss or damage resulting from any delay or failure to perform any part of this

                                     X.  RECORDS

     Consultant shall maintain a written record of all work performed and data
generated in the course of performance under this Agreement and shall prepare a
written summary of all work performed hereunder.  Such written material shall be
the sole property of TRW and shall be made available on request.  TRW shall have
the right to request preliminary reports from Consultant which represent the
findings and conclusions of Consultant based on the information which exists at
that time.  Upon completion of each specific project or termination of this
Agreement, Consultant shall, if requested by TRW, promptly furnish TRW a
complete report, together with all supporting contract data.


                                     XI.  CHANGES

     TRW may order changes in the description of services to be performed by
Consultant.  If Consultant believes that any change requested will require
additional compensation to Consultant or will adversely affect the schedule for
rendering services, before proceeding with any work on the change, Consultant
will so advise TRW and thereafter Consultant will not proceed with any such
change until Consultant has received written authorization from TRW to do so.

This Agreement may not be amended, modified or otherwise changed except by an
instrument in writing signed by TRW and Consultant.


                             XII.  INDEPENDENT CONTRACTOR

     Consultant agrees that in the performance of this Agreement, Consultant
shall act as an independent contractor, and not as an employee of TRW, and all
of Consultant's agents and employees shall be subject solely to the control,
supervision and authority of Consultant.  Consultant understands and agrees that
TRW will not cover Consultant or Consultant's employees or agents with Worker's
Compensation, Unemployment Insurance, State Disability Insurance, public
liability insurance or other benefits that may be available to employees of TRW.
Consultant shall refrain from any representation that Consultant is an employee,
agent or legal representative of TRW, or from incurring liabilities or
obligations of any kind in the name, or on behalf, of TRW.

     It is agreed that (a) Consultant shall be responsible for Social Security
taxes, if any, which may be applicable and for any other applicable fees or
taxes (federal, state or local) which may be required; and (b) Consultant and
Consultant's employees, agents, heirs, successors and assigns shall not be
entitled, by virtue of any work done under this Agreement, to any benefits under
any medical or travel accident insurance, pension, sick leave, life insurance,
vacation, or disability, or other employees' benefit plan or plans maintained by
TRW for its employees.
                                XIII.  INDEMNIFICATION

     TRW agrees to indemnify and hold Consultant harmless from and against any
losses, claims, damages, liabilities, or actions related to or arising out of
this engagement and Consultant's role in connection therewith, and will
reimburse Consultant for all expenses (including reasonable counsel fees)
incurred by Consultant in connection with investigating, preparing or defending
any such action or claim, whether or not in connection with pending or
threatened litigation in which Consultant is a party, if Consultant acted in
good faith and in a manner Consultant reasonably believed to be in or not
opposed to the best interests of TRW and, with respect to any criminal action or
proceeding, had no reasonable cause to believe Consultant's conduct was
unlawful.

     If any action or proceeding is brought against Consultant in respect of
which indemnity may be sought against TRW pursuant hereto, Consultant shall
promptly notify TRW in writing of the commencement of such action or proceeding,
but the omission so to notify TRW shall not relieve TRW from any other
obligation or liability which TRW may have to Consultant otherwise than under
this Agreement or with respect to any other action or proceeding.  In case any
such action or proceeding shall be brought against Consultant, TRW shall be
entitled to participate in such action or proceeding, and, after a written
notice from TRW to Consultant, to assume the defense of such action or
proceeding

                                                              Initialed PSH/COM

                                         -7-
<PAGE>

with counsel of TRW's choice at its expense (in which case TRW shall not
thereafter be responsible for the fees and expenses of any separate counsel
retained by Consultant); provided, however, that such counsel shall be
reasonably satisfactory to Consultant in the exercise of Consultant's reasonable
judgment.

     Notwithstanding TRW's election to assume the defense of such action or
proceeding, Consultant shall have the right to employ separate counsel and to
participate in the defense of such action or proceeding.  TRW shall bear the
reasonable fees, costs and expenses of one such separate counsel (and shall pay
such fees, costs and expenses at least quarterly) if TRW approves in advance the
separate counsel selected by Consultant and if:  (i) the use of counsel chosen
by TRW to represent Consultant would present such counsel with a conflict of
interest; (ii) the defendants in, or targets of, any such action or proceeding
include both Consultant and TRW, and, upon advice of counsel, Consultant shall
have reasonably concluded that there may be legal defenses available to
Consultant which are materially different from those available to TRW (in which
case TRW shall not have the right to direct the defense of such action or
proceeding on behalf of Consultant); (iii) TRW shall not have employed counsel
reasonably satisfactory to Consultant in the exercise of reasonable judgment to
represent Consultant within a reasonable time after notice of the institution of
such action or proceeding; or (iv) TRW shall authorize Consultant to employ
separate counsel at TRW's expense.

     TRW and Consultant understand that the indemnity provisions contained in
this Agreement shall be in addition to any and all other rights and remedies
which the parties may have at law or in equity or otherwise, including, but not
limited to, any right of contribution.

     Notwithstanding anything contained herein to the contrary, it is the
intention of TRW and Consultant that the indemnification provided herein by TRW
to Consultant shall not be more than that provided to a presently serving
elected officer of TRW Inc.

     Consultant hereby agrees to indemnify, defend and save TRW, its officers,
directors, employees and agents harmless from and against any expense, claim,
action, loss or liability to any third party that results from or is caused by,
directly or indirectly, Consultant's bad faith, willful misconduct, recklessness
or unlawful conduct or the bad faith, willful misconduct, recklessness or
unlawful conduct of Consultant's employees, agents, subcontractors, suppliers or
other third parties utilized in connection with Consultant's performance.  In
agreeing to indemnify TRW under this section, Consultant expressly waives any
immunity from liability Consultant may be entitled to under Section 35, Article
II of the Ohio Constitution and Ohio Revised Code Section 4123.74 which provides
immunity to complying employers from actions for damages by employees injured in
the course of or arising out of their employment.  Nothing in this
indemnification shall limit the protection otherwise available to TRW employees
or other persons performing

                                                              Initialed PSH/COM

emergency first-aid services under Ohio Revised Code Sections 2305.23 and
4731.90.


                               XIV.  NONDISCRIMINATION

     Consultant:  (a) will not discriminate against any applicant for employment
on the basis of race, color, non-job related handicap, veteran status, religion,
sex, national origin or age; (b) will take affirmative action to ensure that
applicants are employed and employees are treated during employment without
regard to their race, color, religion, sex, national origin, veteran status or
non-job related handicap; and (c) will otherwise at all times comply with all
applicable federal, state and local laws, rules, regulations, orders and
ordinances relating to equal employment opportunity.  Without limiting the
generality of the foregoing, Consultant shall at all times comply fully with the
provisions of the following regulations and Executive Orders, as the same may be
amended or modified from time to time, and all rules and regulations promulgated
thereunder or relating thereto or to such Executive Orders, as so amended or
modified, such rules and regulations being herein incorporated by this
reference:  (i) Executive Order 11246, as amended by Executive Order 11375
(relating to nondiscrimination in employment by Government contracts and trade
contractors); (ii) Executive Order 11625 (relating to utilization of minority
business enterprises); (iii) Executive Order 11701 and 41 CFR 60-250 (relating
to employment of certain veterans); (iv) Executive Order 11758 and 41 CFR 60-
741:4 (relating to employment of handicapped persons); and (v) Executive
Order 11141 (relating to nondiscrimination on the basis of age).  Consultant
shall, upon request of TRW, provide TRW with such certifications and undertake
such other actions as TRW may deem appropriate to verify and assure Consultant's
compliance with such Executive Orders and regulations.


                                    XV.  PUBLICITY

     Notwithstanding any provision to the contrary herein or otherwise, except
as TRW grants prior written approval, Consultant shall not publicize the
existence or terms of, or work performed under, this Agreement.


                                   XVI.  ASSIGNMENT

     This Agreement shall not be assignable by either party without the prior
written consent of the other party, except that TRW may assign this Agreement
without such consent with respect to any corporate reorganization, merger,
transfer of assets or similar transactions pursuant to which all of TRW's rights
and obligations hereunder are transferred by operation of law or otherwise.

     This Agreement, including the engagement letter and these terms and
conditions, sets forth the entire understanding between the parties relating to
the subject matter contained herein and merges all prior discussions between
them.  Neither party shall be bound by any condition, warranty, or
representation other than as expressly stated in this Agreement or as
subsequently set forth in writing signed by the parties.  If prior agreements,
letters or proposals relating to the subject matter of this Agreement are
inconsistent with the terms and conditions of the Agreement, this Agreement
shall govern.

          you obtain from TRW, its employees, subsidiaries and affiliates,
          or that you otherwise acquire while engaged hereunder, including
          information of a third party as to which TRW has a nondisclosure
          obligation.  Additionally, TRW Confidential Information shall
          include any and all reports to TRW made by you hereunder or the
          contents thereof.  In view of the sensitive information to which
          you will have access during your engagement hereunder, any
          information reflecting upon or concerning TRW and known,
          communicated or accessible to you will also be deemed to be TRW

          You:

               You warrant that you have the right to enter into this

          entered into by you.  You will comply with TRW's policies,
          directives and standards and with all applicable federal, state

          account of any loss or damage resulting from any delay or failure

          refrain from any representation that you are an employee of TRW, and

                                   ARTICLE III

                                  PARTICIPATION

     3.1  PARTICIPATION.

          (a)  Subject to the limitations set forth in this Article III, any
     person who is an Eligible Employee in the year for which the Incentive
     Compensation deferred under a Deferral Elections under this Section 3.1 is
     payable may participate in the Plan by executing and filing with the head
     of Human Resources a Participation Agreement; provided, however,  the
     election to defer Incentive Bonus will not be effective unless the Eligible
     Employee is also a Highly Paid Employee.  The head of Human Resources shall
     determine, in his sole discretion, which Eligible Employees are likely to
     be Highly Paid Employees during the year in which the Deferral Election is
     made.  The head of Human Resources shall then notify Eligible Employees
     whether their elections to defer Incentive Bonuses are effective.

          (b)  In each Participation Agreement, the Eligible Employee shall
     specify the percentage or dollar amount of Incentive Bonus and the
     percentage or the dollar amount of Strategic Grant in respect of a
     specified TRW fiscal year to be deferred and the Eligible Employee shall
     specify, subject to the limitations of Section 5.1, the form of Plan
     Benefit (i.e., whether such benefits are intended to be paid following
     retirement or five or ten years from the Date of Deposit).  If the Eligible
     Employee chooses to defer a dollar amount of the Incentive Bonus or the
     Strategic Grant and to the extent that dollar amount specified exceeds the
     eligible amount of the Incentive Bonus or the Strategic Grant, as
     applicable, the amount actually deferred shall be eligible amount of the
     Incentive Bonus or the Strategic Grant, as applicable.  If the Eligible
     Employee  has chosen to have Deferred Compensation paid five or ten years
     from the Date of Deposit, such payments shall be made as provided in
     Section 5.1(d) below.

          (c)  Before September 30, 1993 with respect to 1993, and September 30
     of each subsequent Plan Year with respect to each Plan Year thereafter,
     each Eligible Employee who elects to become a Participant shall file with
     the head of Human Resources a Participation Agreement specifying his
     Deferral Election for any Incentive Compensation payable in respect of that
     Plan Year and whether such Deferred Compensation is intended to be payable
     the year following retirement or five or ten years from the Date of
     Deposit.


                                       -6-
<PAGE>


     3.2  DEFERRAL ELECTIONS.  Subject to the restrictions concerning deferral
of Incentive Bonus set forth in Section 3.1(a), any Eligible Employee may elect
to defer any percentage or dollar amount (but not both a percentage and dollar
amount, but an Eligible Employee can defer a specified dollar amount of one of
his Incentive Bonus and Strategic Grant and a percentage of the other) of each
of his Strategic Grant and his Incentive Bonus; provided, however, that, to the
extent that the Eligible Employee chooses to defer a percentage of his Incentive
Bonus and/or Strategic Bonus, each Deferral Election, to be effective, must
result in deferral of a minimum of 10% of the Eligible Employee's Incentive
Bonus and/or Strategic Grant  (provided that an Eligible Employee may elect to
defer a portion of his Incentive Bonus and none of his Strategic Grant and vice
versa) and the Deferral Elections must be in increments of 5%  for each of the
Strategic Grant and Incentive Bonus, which election percentages do not need to
be identical; further, provided, however, that, to the extent that the Eligible
Employee chooses to defer a specified amount of his Incentive Bonus and/or
Strategic Bonus, each Deferral Election, to be effective, must result in
deferral of a minimum of $10,000 of the Eligible Employee's Incentive Bonus
and/or Strategic Grant  (provided that an Eligible Employee may elect to defer a
portion of his Incentive Bonus and none of his Strategic Grant and vice versa)
and the Deferral Elections must be in increments of $1,000  for each of the
Strategic Grant and Incentive Bonus, which election amounts do not need to be
identical.

     3.3  MODIFICATION OF DEFERRAL ELECTION.  By written notice to TRW, a
Deferral Election filed in any Plan Year may be modified or revoked at any time
prior to October 1 of such Plan Year.  Thereafter, a Deferral Election specified
in a Participation Agreement shall be irrevocable, except that the Committee or
the Special Committee, as appropriate under Article II, may permit a Participant
at any time prior to the actual deferral of the Incentive Compensation to reduce
the designated percentage to be deferred upon a finding, based upon uniform
standards established by the Committee, that the Participant has suffered a
Financial Hardship.


                                   ARTICLE IV

                              DEFERRED COMPENSATION

     4.1  DEFERRED COMPENSATION.  The amount of Incentive Compensation deferred
pursuant to a Deferral Election shall be withheld in a single sum at the time
such Incentive Compensation, but for a Deferral Election, would be paid.

     4.2  WITHHOLDING OF TAXES AND SSP/BEP CONTRIBUTIONS.  Any withholding of
taxes or other amounts which is required by any federal, state, or local law
shall be withheld from the Participant's remaining undeferred Incentive
Compensation, if any.  If necessary in order to comply with any federal, state
or


                                       -7-
<PAGE>


local law, the amount of Incentive Compensation deferred may be reduced by an
amount equal to any required withholding.  Otherwise, such withholding may be
made from any of the Participant's other compensation payable by the
Corporation, or, at the election of the head of Human Resources, a Participant
may be permitted to pay to the Corporation the amount of any such required
withholding at or prior to the time such withholding would otherwise be required
to be made.  In addition, the amount of Incentive Compensation deferred shall be
reduced by the amount of TRW Stock Savings Plan and Benefits Equalization Plan
contributions to be made by the Eligible Employee on account of such Incentive
Compensation.

     4.3  ACCOUNTS.  For recordkeeping purposes only, a separate Account shall
be established and maintained by TRW for each Participant to which his Deferred
Compensation and interest accrued thereon pursuant to Section 4.4 shall be
credited.  Each such Account shall be divided into the following Sub-Accounts
for purposes of Section 5.1:  (i) a Retirement Payment Sub-Account to which
there shall be credited all Incentive Compensation deferred (and all interest
thereon) pursuant to all Deferral Elections under which a Plan Benefit is
payable the year following retirement; and (ii) a separate Pre-Retirement
Payment Sub-Account for each Deferral Election under which the Participant has
elected that his Plan Benefit be payable five or ten years from the Date of
Deposit, to which the Incentive Compensation deferred (and all interest thereon)
pursuant to such Deferral Election shall be credited.

     4.4  DETERMINATION OF ACCOUNT.  The value of each Participant's Account as
of each Determination Date shall be the total of the Participant's Retirement
Payment and Pre-Retirement Payment Sub-Accounts.  The value of each such Sub-
Account shall consist of (i) the balance of such Sub-Account as of the last
preceding Determination Date plus (ii) any Deferred Compensation credited to
such Sub-Account since the last preceding Determination Date, plus (iii)
interest in the amount determined by multiplying the average daily balance of
such Sub-Account during the three calendar months since the last preceding
Determination Date by the Interest Rate applicable to such three-month period,
less (iv) the amount of all Plan Benefits, if any, paid during the period since
the last preceding Determination Date.  Interest, determined as provided in
(iii) above, shall be credited to each such Sub-Account as of the Determination
Date as of which such Sub-Account is valued.

     4.5  STATEMENT OF ACCOUNTS.  TRW shall submit to each Participant, within
one hundred twenty (120) days after the close of each Plan Year and at such
other times as determined by the Committee, a statement setting forth the total
balance of the Participant's Account, and the balance of each Sub-Account
thereof, as of the last day of such Plan Year and as of the last day of the
immediately preceding Plan Year, the Deferred Compensation and interest credited
to each Sub-Account during the Plan Year and the payments of the Plan Benefits
from each Sub-Account during the Plan Year.

                                  PLAN BENEFITS

     5.1  PLAN BENEFITS PAYABLE ON TERMINATION OF EMPLOYMENT, FIVE YEARS FROM
DATE OF DEPOSIT OR TEN YEARS FROM DATE OF DEPOSIT.

          (a) Subject to the provisions of Section 5.1(b) and except as
     otherwise provided below, upon Termination of Employment a Participant
     shall receive a Plan Benefit equal to the balance of his Account as of the
     Determination Date immediately preceding such Termination of Employment,
     plus the amount of any Deferred Compensation credited his Account after
     such Determination Date.  Such Plan Benefit shall be payable as a single
     sum within a reasonable time following such Termination of Employment.  In
     addition, the Participant shall receive interest on the balance of his
     Account for the period from such Determination Date to the date of payment
     at a daily simple interest rate equivalent to the Interest Rate then in
     effect.  However, in the event that the Termination of Employment is the
     result of a divestiture of the unit or operations of the Corporation where
     the Participant worked prior to Termination of Employment and the
     Participant obtains employment with the entity that acquired such unit or
     operations, then the balance of such Participant's Retirement Payment Sub-
     Account shall not be payable until such Participant commences receiving
     retirement benefits from the Corporation and the balance of such
     Participant's Pre-Retirement Payment Sub-Account shall not be payable until
     such time as the Participant would have received payment in accordance with
     the original Deferral Election had the Participant's employment with the
     Corporation not been terminated.  At such time, the amounts in such
     Participant's Account shall be paid as set forth in Sections 5.1(b) and
     5.1(e).  Interest shall continue to be earned on such Participant's Account
     following such Participant's Termination of Employment through payment in
     full of the his or her Account.


          (b)  In the event that a Participant's Termination of Employment
     occurs as a result of his retirement, the Participant shall receive the
     Plan Benefit payable in respect of his Retirement Payment Sub-Accounts in
     ten annual installments commencing in the year following the year that
     Termination of Employment occurred; provided, however, that the Participant
     can petition the Special Committee (or the Committee in the case of an
     Executive Officer) at any time at least six months prior to retirement to
     change such payment into five annual installments or a single sum; further
     provided, that any such payment change approved by


                                       -9-
<PAGE>


     the Special Committee (or the Committee) shall not be effective until the
     calendar year following the date of the payment change.  In the event that
     payment shall be made in a single sum, such payment shall be in accordance
     with the procedures set forth in Section 5.1(a) above, but in no event in
     the same calendar year as the year of any requested change and no earlier
     than January 1 of the calendar year following the year that Termination of
     Employment occurred.  In the event that the payment shall be made in
     installments,  such payments shall be made in accordance with Section
     5.1(e) below.  If, at the time of retirement, the Participant has a credit
     in a Pre-Retirement Payment Sub-Account, such Sub-Account balances shall be
     paid in a single sum following retirement in accordance with the procedures
     set forth in Section 5.1(a) above.

          (c)  In the event that a Participant's Termination of Employment
     occurs because of his death, his Beneficiary or, if no designated
     Beneficiary shall survive him, his estate shall receive the Plan Benefit in
     the manner provided in Section 5.1(a); provided, however, that if the
     Participant's Beneficiary designation shall result in all or any part of
     his Plan Benefit passing to his surviving spouse or to an entity for the
     benefit of his surviving spouse in such a way as to qualify for the marital
     deduction under Section 2056 of the Code, and at the time of his death the
     Participant was eligible to retire and had elected to receive his Plan
     Benefits in his Retirement Payment Sub-Account in installments pursuant to
     Section 5.1(b), payments from his Retirement Payment Sub-Account shall be
     made to such surviving spouse or to such entity for the benefit of such
     surviving spouse, as the case may be, in the manner provided in Section
     5.1(b).  Notwithstanding the foregoing, if such surviving spouse shall die
     prior to complete distribution of all Plan Benefits, the balance then
     remaining in such Retirement Payment Sub-Account shall be paid to the
     estate of such surviving spouse or to such entity for the benefit of such
     surviving spouse, as the case may be, in a single sum within a reasonable
     time following such spouse's death.

          (d)  If the Participant has chosen in his Deferral Election to receive
     payouts either five or ten years from the Date of Deposit (as opposed to
     upon retirement from the Corporation), payments shall be made in a single
     sum form from each Pre-Retirement Payment Sub-Account of the Participant on
     or before February 15 of the year either five or ten years (depending upon
     the applicable Deferral Election) following the applicable Date of Deposit;
     provided, however, that if Termination of Employment has occurred prior to
     payment, payment of the Participant's Plan Benefits shall be made as
     provided in Section 5.1(a).

          (e)  If the payments from the Participant's Retirement Payment Sub-
     Account are to be paid in installment form, such installments shall be paid
     in either five or ten annual installments between February 1 and


                                      -10-
<PAGE>


     February 15 of each year in which an installment is to be made; provided,
     however, that the initial installment payment will be made a reasonable
     time following Termination of Employment (but no earlier than February 1 of
     the calendar year following the year that Termination of Employment
     occurred).  Installment payments will commence in the year following the
     Participant's Termination of Employment.  The five year installment
     payments shall be made as follows: in the first year in which a payment is
     to be made, an amount equal to one-fifth of the balance of the Sub-Account
     on December 31 immediately preceding the first payment shall be paid; in
     the second year in which a payment is to be made, an amount equal to one-
     fourth of the balance of the Sub-Account on December 31 immediately
     preceding the second payment shall be paid; in the third year in which a
     payment is to be made, an amount equal to one-third of the balance of the
     Sub-Account on December 31 immediately preceding the third payment shall be
     paid; in the fourth year in which a payment is to be made, an amount equal
     to one-half of the balance of the Sub-Account on December 31 immediately
     preceding the fourth payment shall be paid; and in the fifth year in which
     a payment is to be made, an amount equal to the remaining balance of the
     Sub-Account on December 31 immediately preceding the fifth payment shall be
     paid.  The ten installment payments shall be made as follows: in the first
     year in which a payment is to be made, an amount equal to one-tenth of the
     balance of the Sub-Account on the December 31 immediately preceding the
     first payment shall be paid; in the second year in which a payment is to be
     made, an amount equal to one-ninth of the balance of the Sub-Account on the
     December 31 immediately preceding the second payment shall be paid; in the
     third year in which a payment is to be made, an amount equal to one-eighth
     of the balance of the Sub-Account on the December 31 immediately preceding
     the third payment shall be paid; in the fourth year in which a payment is
     to be made, an amount equal to one-seventh of the balance of the Sub-
     Account on the December 31 immediately preceding the fourth payment shall
     be paid; in the fifth year in which a payment is to be made, an amount
     equal to one-sixth of the balance of the Sub-Account on the December 31
     immediately preceding the fifth payment shall be paid; in the sixth year in
     which a payment is to be made, an amount equal to one-fifth of the balance
     of the Sub-Account on the December 31 immediately preceding the sixth
     payment shall be paid; in the seventh year in which a payment is to be
     made, an amount equal to one-fourth of the balance of the Sub-Account on
     the December 31 immediately preceding the seventh payment shall be paid; in
     the eighth year in which a payment is to be made, an amount equal to one-
     third of the balance of the Sub-Account on the December 31 immediately
     preceding the eighth payment shall be paid; in the ninth year in which a
     payment is to be made, an amount equal to one-half of the balance of the
     Sub-Account on the December 31 immediately preceding the ninth payment
     shall be paid; and in the tenth year in which a payment is to be made, the
     balance of the Sub-Account


                                      -11-
<PAGE>


     remaining on the December 31 immediately preceding the tenth payment shall
     be paid.  Interest on Retirement Payment Sub-Account from which installment
     payments are made shall accrue until the December 31 immediately preceding
     the payment of the tenth installment.

     5.2  WITHDRAWAL OF PLAN BENEFIT.  No Plan Benefit shall be payable prior to
the Participant's Termination of Employment other than in the form determined
pursuant to Section 5.1(d), except that the Committee or the Special Committee,
as appropriate under Article II, may permit a Participant or, after a
Participant's death, a Participant's Beneficiary or other person or entity
entitled to receive such Plan Benefit, to withdraw from the Participant's
Account an amount necessary to meet a Financial Hardship.

     5.3  WITHHOLDING; PAYROLL TAXES.  TRW shall withhold from Plan Benefits

Plan, all Plan Benefits shall be paid to the Participant no later than the

                             BENEFICIARY DESIGNATION

     6.1  BENEFICIARY DESIGNATION.  Each Participant shall have the right, at
any time, to designate any person or persons as his Beneficiary (both principal
as well as contingent) to whom payment under the Plan shall be made in the event
of his death prior to complete distribution of all Plan Benefits due him under
the Plan.  Any Beneficiary designation shall be made in writing on a form
prescribed by the Committee and shall become effective only when filed with the
head of Human Resources.

     6.2  AMENDMENTS.  Subject to the limitations of Section 6.1 of the Plan,
any Beneficiary designation may be changed by a Participant only by written
notice of such change to the head of Human Resources on a form prescribed by the
Committee.  The filing of a new Beneficiary designation form will cancel all
prior Beneficiary designations.

     6.3  ABSENCE OF EFFECTIVE BENEFICIARY DESIGNATION.  If a Participant fails
to designate a Beneficiary as provided above or if all designated Beneficiaries
predecease the Participant or die prior to complete distribution of the
Participant's Plan Benefit, the Participant's remaining Plan Benefit shall be
paid to his estate.

<PAGE>


     6.4  EFFECT OF PAYMENT.  Payment to the Beneficiary designated pursuant to
Sections 6.1 and 6.2 or to the Participant's estate pursuant to Section 6.3

                        AMENDMENT AND TERMINATION OF PLAN

     7.1  TERMINATION.  The Committee shall have the power in its sole
discretion to suspend or terminate the Plan at any time, except that no such
action shall adversely affect rights with respect to any Account without the
consent of the person affected.

     7.2  AMENDMENT.  The Committee can amend any part of this Plan (including,
without limitation, changing the interest rate to be paid to current and future
Participants or changing who can become Participants) in its sole discretion
without notice to Participants.

                                  ARTICLE VIII

                                  MISCELLANEOUS

primarily to provide Deferred Compensation benefits for a select group of
executive, managerial or professional employees of the Corporation.

     8.2  UNSECURED GENERAL CREDITOR.  Participants and their Beneficiaries,
estates, heirs, successors and assigns shall have no legal or equitable rights,
interest or claims in any property or assets of TRW.  Such assets of TRW shall
not be held under any trust or in any other way as collateral security for the
fulfillment of the obligations of TRW under the Plan.  Any and all of TRW's
assets shall be, and remain, the general, unpledged, unrestricted assets of TRW.
TRW's sole obligation under the Plan shall be merely that of an unfunded and
unsecured promise of TRW to pay money in the future.

     8.3  NONASSIGNABILITY.  Neither a Participant nor any other person shall
have any right to commute, sell, assign, transfer, pledge, anticipate, mortgage
or otherwise encumber, transfer, hypothecate or convey, in advance of actual
receipt, any Plan Benefit.  Plan Benefits and all rights to Plan Benefits are
and shall be nonassignable and nontransferable prior to actual payment as
provided by the Plan.  Any such attempted assignment or transfer shall be
ineffective; TRW's sole obligation shall be to pay Plan Benefits to the
Participant, his Beneficiary or his estate as appropriate.  No part of any Plan
Benefit shall, prior to actual payment as provided by the Plan, be subject to
seizure or sequestration for the payment of any debts, judgments, alimony or
separate maintenance owed by a Participant or any other person; nor shall any
Plan Benefit be transferable


                                      -13-
<PAGE>


by operation of law in the event of a Participant's or any other person's
bankruptcy or insolvency, except as required by law.

     8.4  NOT A CONTRACT OF EMPLOYMENT.  Neither the terms and conditions of the
Plan nor those of any Participation Agreement shall be deemed to constitute a
contract of employment between the Corporation and the Participant, and neither
the Participant, his Beneficiary nor his estate shall have any rights against
TRW under the Plan except as may otherwise be specifically provided in the Plan.
Moreover, nothing in the Plan shall be deemed to give a Participant the right to
be retained in the service of the Corporation or to interfere with the right of
the Corporation to discipline, discharge or change the status of a Participant
at any time.  Further, nothing in the Plan shall be deemed to give a Participant
a right to receive any Incentive Compensation.

     8.5  PROTECTIVE PROVISIONS.  A Participant will cooperate with TRW by
furnishing any and all information requested by TRW in order to facilitate the
payment of Plan Benefits under the Plan, and by taking such other action as may
be reasonably requested by TRW.

     8.6  TERMS.  Whenever any words are used in the Plan in the masculine, they
shall be construed as though they were used in the feminine in all cases where
they would so apply; and wherever any words are used in the Plan in the singular
or in the plural, they shall be construed as though they were used in the plural
or singular, as the case may be, in all cases where they would so apply.

     8.7  CAPTIONS.  The captions of the articles and sections of the Plan are
for convenience only and shall not control or affect the meaning or construction
of any of its provisions.

     8.8. GOVERNING LAW.  The provisions of the Plan shall be construed and
interpreted according to the laws of the State of Ohio.

     8.9  VALIDITY.  In case any provision of the Plan shall be held illegal or
invalid for any reason, said illegality or invalidity shall not affect the
remaining provisions of the Plan, and the Plan shall be construed and enforced
as if such illegal or invalid provision were not included in the Plan.

     8.10 NOTICE OR FILING.  Any notice or filing required or permitted to be
given to TRW or a Participant under the Plan shall be sufficient if in writing
and hand delivered, or sent by regular mail or by registered or certified mail,
to the principal office of TRW or to the last known address of the Participant,
as the case may be.  Such notice or filing shall be deemed given or made (i)
when hand delivered to the residence or offices of the recipient, (ii) as of
five (5) days after the date of mailing if delivery is made by regular mail, or,
(iii) as of five (5) days after the date shown on the postmark on the receipt

certification provided to the sender at the time of mailing, if by registered or
certified mail.

     8.11 SUCCESSORS.  The provisions of the Plan shall bind and obligate TRW
and any successors.  The term "successors" as used in this Section 8.11 shall
include any corporate or other business entity which shall, whether by merger,
consolidation, purchase or otherwise acquire all or substantially all of the
business and assets of TRW and successors of any such corporation or other
business entity.

     8.12 EXPENSES AND COSTS.  TRW shall bear all expenses and costs in
connection with the operation of the Plan.

     8.13 RELIANCE ON CERTIFIED PUBLIC ACCOUNTANTS.  TRW, the Directors, the
Committee, the Special Committee, the head of Human Resources and any employee
of TRW or the Corporation shall be fully protected for actions taken in good
faith based on the computations and reports made pursuant to or in connection
with the Plan by the independent certified public accountants who audit TRW's
accounts.

     8.14 PRONOUN REFERENCES.   References to "he," "his" or "him" in the Plan
are used in the generic sense and shall apply to all Participants without
reference to the gender of the Participant.

                        KEY EXECUTIVE LIFE INSURANCE PLAN
     1.   PURPOSE

          The purpose of the TRW Inc. Key Executive Life Insurance Plan (the
          "Plan") is to create a plan under which TRW Inc. ("TRW") can assist
          certain of its Executives and those of its subsidiaries and affiliates
          in acquiring life insurance coverage.

     2.   DEFINITIONS

          For purposes of this Plan, the following terms have the meanings set
          forth below:

          2.01 AGREEMENT means the Agreement executed by a Participant
               implementing the terms of this Plan.

          2.02 ALTERNATIVE DEATH BENEFIT AMOUNT means, with respect to a
               Participant, an amount which, after subtracting any TRW federal,
               state, and local income tax savings resulting from the
               deductibility of the payment for corporate tax purposes, is equal
               to the Participant's Coverage Amount.  The Alternative Death
               Benefit Amount shall be determined at the time the payment is to
               be made, based on TRW's federal, state and local income tax rate
               (calculated at the highest marginal tax rate then applicable to
               TRW but net of any federal deduction for state and local taxes)
               at the time of the payment, and shall be determined by TRW.

          2.03 ASSIGNEE means that person or entity to whom the Participant has
               assigned his interest in the Policy by designating such Assignee
               on forms provided by TRW.  If the Participant's Policy is a
               Survivorship Policy and if the Participant has not specifically
               designated an Assignee, then, after the Participant's death, if
               the Co-insured survives, the Assignee shall be that person or
               entity who succeeds to the Participant's interest in the
               Participant's Policy after the death of the Participant.

          2.04 CHANGE IN CONTROL means a Change in Control of TRW, as such term
               is defined from time to time in the Amended and Restated
               Employment Continuation Agreement between TRW and its Chief
               Executive Officer.

               The determination shall be made by TRW based on projections
               provided by the Insurer or its agent.  Projections shall be based
               on then current mortality charges and the lower of:  (i) the
               dividend or interest crediting rate applicable to the Policy at
               the

               thirty-six (36) months immediately preceding the time of
               determination (or the monthly average for such shorter period as
               data is available, if it is not available for the full thirty-six
               (36) months).

          2.14 PLAN ADMINISTRATOR means with respect to a member of the
               Management Committee  of TRW, the Committee.  For all other
               Executives, the Plan Administrator means the Chief Executive
               Officer of TRW.

          2.15 POLICY means the life insurance coverage acquired on the life of
               the Participant (or on the lives of the Participant and a Co-
               insured, in the case of a Survivorship Policy) by the owner of
               the Policy.

          2.16 POLICY SURRENDER VALUE means, with respect to a Participant's
               Policy, the actual cash surrender value of the Policy, net of any
               applicable surrender charges, which would be available upon a
               complete surrender of the Policy.

          2.17 PREMIUM means, with respect to a Participant's Policy, the amount

               the death of the last survivor of the Participant and the Co-
               insured.

          2.19 TERMINATED FOR CAUSE  means a determination made by the Directors
               of TRW, at a hearing which the Participant may attend, that a
               Participant  has been terminated for cause, as that term is
               defined in any written employment agreement existing between TRW
               (or any subsidiary or affiliate of TRW) and the Participant;
               absent any such agreement, or absent a definition of the term in
               the agreement, the term shall mean the termination of the
               Participant's employment with TRW (or any subsidiary or affiliate
               of TRW) due to: (i) fraud, misappropriation or intentional
               material damage to the property or business of TRW (or any
               subsidiary or affiliate of TRW); (ii) commission of a felony; or
               (iii) continuance of either willful and repeated failure or
               grossly negligent and repeated failure by the Participant to
               perform his duties.

          2.20 VESTED EXECUTIVE means an Executive who is age 55 or older, who
               has five or more Years of Service and who has been in an Eligible
               Position for at least three years; provided, that in the sole
               discretion of, and by written action of, the Plan Administrator,
               an Executive who is not age 55, who has fewer than five Years of
               Service and/or who has not been in an Eligible Position for at
               least three years may be designated a Vested Executive for the
               limited purpose of this Plan.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, an
               Executive will not be treated as a Vested Executive if the
               Executive is Terminated for Cause.

          2.21 YEAR OF SERVICE shall have the definition specified in the TRW
               Salaried Pension Plan, but shall in any case include any period
               of time during which a Participant is receiving benefits under
               TRW's Long Term Disability Plan or is on an approved medical
               leave.

     3.   ELIGIBILITY AND COVERAGE AMOUNT

          The eligibility of an Executive, as well as the applicable Coverage
          Amount, will be determined by the Plan Administrator.

          If, during the insurance application and underwriting process, it is
          determined that the Executive's health is such that the cost of the
          insurance would be prohibitive, the Plan Administrator may, in its
          sole discretion, determine that the Executive will not be eligible to
          participate in the Plan, provide a reduced Coverage Amount, or take
          any other action it deems appropriate.

     4.   TYPE OF COVERAGE

          A Participant may elect single life coverage on the Participant's
          life, or survivorship coverage on the joint lives of the Participant
          and any other person (subject to any requirements imposed by the
          Insurer with respect to the person(s) who may be designated as a Co-
          Insured).  Once elected by the Participant, the type of coverage and
          the Co-Insured cannot be changed without the consent of the Plan
          Administrator.

     5.   PAYMENT OF PREMIUMS

          5.01 TRW PAYMENTS.  Subject to Sections 7.01, 7.02, 12.01 and 12.02,
               TRW shall pay all Policy Premiums necessary to maintain the
               Policy death benefit at a level at least equal to the
               Participant's Coverage Amount.


                                       -4-

<PAGE>

          5.02 PARTICIPANT PAYMENTS.  Unless otherwise provided in a
               Participant's Agreement, a Participant shall not be required to
               pay any portion of the Premium due on the Participant's Policy.

     6.   POLICY OWNERSHIP

          6.01 OWNERSHIP.  TRW shall be the owner of a Participant's Policy and
               shall be entitled to exercise the rights of ownership, except
               that the following rights shall be exercisable by the Participant
               (or Assignee):  (i)  the right to designate the beneficiary or
               beneficiaries to receive payment of the portion of the death
               benefit under the Participant's Policy equal to the Coverage
               Amount; and (ii) the right to assign any part or all of the
               Participant's rights under the Policy to any person, entity or
               trust by the execution of a written instrument prescribed by TRW
               which is delivered to TRW.  Also, except as provided in
               Section 7, TRW shall not borrow from, hypothecate, surrender in
               whole or in part, cancel, or in any other manner encumber a
               Participant's Policy without the prior written consent of the
               Participant's Assignee or, if there is no Assignee, the
               Participant.

          6.02 POSSESSION OF POLICY.  TRW shall keep possession of the Policy.
               TRW agrees to make the Policy available to the Participant (or
               Assignee) or to the Insurer at such times as, and on such terms
               as, TRW determines for the sole purposes of endorsing or filing
               any change of beneficiary or assignment on the Policy.

     7.   TERMINATION EVENTS

          7.01 TERMINATION EVENTS. Except as provided in Section 7.02, TRW's
               obligation to pay Premiums with respect to a Participant's Policy
               shall terminate:

               a.   Automatically upon the death of the Participant (or the
                    death of the last survivor of the Participant and the
                    Co-insured, if the Policy is a Survivorship Policy).
               b.   Automatically upon a  Participant's Termination for Cause.

               c.   Upon the written action of the Plan Administrator, if the
                    Participant terminates employment with TRW (or any
                    subsidiary or affiliate of TRW) and such termination is not
                    a Termination for Cause.


                                       -5-

<PAGE>

               d.   Automatically should a Participant provide services above a
                    de minimis level and without TRW's consent to an entity
                    deemed a competitor of TRW's at any time following three
                    years within the Participant's termination of employment.
                    For purposes of this subsection, an entity will be deemed a
                    competitor if that entity and TRW could not have
                    interlocking directors under 15 U.S.C. Section 19, as the
                    same may be amended from time to time.

               e.   Upon the mutual agreement of TRW and the Participant's
                    Assignee (or the Participant, if there is no Assignee).

          7.02 IRREVOCABLE OBLIGATION.  Notwithstanding any other provision of
               the Plan, (i) TRW's obligation to pay Policy Premiums for a
               Participant who meets the requirements for a Vested Executive
               shall be irrevocable while such person is employed by TRW and
               shall remain irrevocable thereafter, unless such Participant
               fails to meet the definition of Vested Executive as a result of
               his being Terminated for Cause or unless the provisions of
               Section 7.01 (d) apply; and (ii) TRW's obligation to pay Policy
               Premiums for a Participant who obtains an irrevocable right
               pursuant to the provisions of Section 9 hereof relating to Change
               in Control shall thereafter be irrevocable.

          7.03 ALLOCATION OF DEATH BENEFIT.  In the event of a termination due
               to the death of the Participant (or the death of the last
               survivor of the Participant and the Participant's Co-insured, if
               the Policy is a Survivorship Policy), the death benefit under the
               Participant's Policy shall be divided as follows:

               a.   The beneficiary or beneficiaries of the Participant (or
                    Assignee) shall be entitled to receive an amount equal to
                    the Coverage Amount.

               b.   TRW shall be entitled to receive the excess of the death
                    benefit.

               TRW agrees to execute an endorsement to the Policy issued to it
               by the Insurer providing for the division of the death benefit in
               accordance with the provisions of this Section.

               Notwithstanding the provisions of this Section, if the Policy
               death benefit becomes payable while there is an Alternative Death
               Benefit Election in

                                       -6-

<PAGE>

               effect for the Participant pursuant to Section 8, then the entire
               Policy death benefit shall be paid to TRW.

          7.04 DISPOSITION OF POLICY.  If a Participant's Agreement terminates
               under Section 7.01(c) or (e), the Participant's Assignee (or the
               Participant, if there is no Assignee) may acquire the
               Participant's Policy from TRW by paying TRW an amount equal to
               the Policy Surrender Value (or any lesser amount determined by
               the Plan Administrator).  In order to exercise this right, the
               person entitled to exercise the right shall notify TRW, in
               writing, of the intention to exercise the option to purchase the
               policy within sixty (60) days following the event of termination.
               If TRW is so notified, TRW shall, within thirty (30) days after
               being notified, provide a written notice to the Assignee (or
               Participant, if there is no Assignee) indicating the payment
               amount required.  Within thirty (30) days after receiving such
               notice from TRW, the Assignee (or Participant, if there is no
               Assignee) shall make the required payment to TRW.  If the payment
               is not made within the required time, the right to acquire the
               Policy shall terminate.  If the required payment is received on a
               timely basis, TRW shall submit to the Insurer, within ten (10)
               business days after receiving the payment, the forms required to
               transfer the Policy ownership to the Assignee (or Participant, if
               there is no Assignee).  If the Assignee (or Participant, if there
               is no Assignee) does not exercise his or her rights to acquire
               the Participant's Policy, the Assignee's (or Participant's)
               rights under the Plan shall terminate, and TRW may, thereafter,
               take any action it deems appropriate with respect to the
               Participant's Policy, free from any restrictions or limitations
               imposed by the Plan.

     8.   ALTERNATIVE DEATH BENEFIT ELECTION

          A Participant (or the Participant's Assignee, if the Participant has
          assigned his or her Policy interest) may elect to receive an
          Alternative Death Benefit in lieu of the insurance benefit provided
          under the Plan.  The Alternative Death Benefit shall be paid by TRW
          from the general funds of TRW, and shall not constitute an insurance
          benefit.  It shall be paid by TRW to the Participant's (or Assignee's)
          beneficiary at the time the Participant's insurance benefit would have
          been paid (at the Participant's death for single life coverage, or at
          the death of the survivor of the Participant and the Participant's Co-
          Insured for survivorship coverage).  The amount of the payment shall
          be equal to the Alternative Death Benefit


                                       -7-

<PAGE>

          Amount.  As long as an Alternative Death Benefit Election is in
          effect, the beneficiary or beneficiaries of the Participant (or
          Assignee) shall receive the Alternative Death Benefit only, and shall
          not be entitled to receive any portion of any death benefits which
          become payable under the Participant's Policy, and the Participant (or
          Assignee) shall cooperate with TRW in effecting a change of
          beneficiary of the Participant's Policy to achieve such result.

          An election under this Section may be revoked.  Any election (or
          revocation of an election) shall be in writing and shall be effective
          when received by TRW.  A Participant (or Assignee) shall not be
          limited in the number of times an Alternative Death Benefit Election
          can be made (or revoked).

     9.   CHANGE IN CONTROL

          If there is a Change in Control:

          a.   the Plan and TRW's obligation to pay Policy Premiums hereunder
               shall become irrevocable for all Participants in the Plan at the
               time of the Change in Control;

          b.   TRW shall immediately transfer the ownership of all Participants'
               Policies to  an irrevocable trust to:  1) pay any premiums
               projected to be payable on all Participants' Policies after the
               Change in Control, in order to qualify each Participant's Policy
               as a Permanent Policy, and 2) pay any Alternative Death Benefit
               which becomes payable under Section 8 of this Plan; and

          c.   TRW shall immediately fund such irrevocable trust with an amount
               sufficient to pay all necessary projected future premiums for all
               Participants' Policies in order to qualify each Participant's
               Policy as a Permanent Policy.

          Notwithstanding the  creation and funding of an irrevocable trust in
          accordance with the provisions of this Section, TRW, or its successor,
          shall continue to be responsible for the premium costs associated with
          the Participants' Policies and any Alternative Death Benefits payable
          under Section 8 if such amounts are not paid by the trust for any
          reason, or if the trust's assets become insufficient to pay any
          required amounts.

                    in accordance with the substantive law of the State of Ohio
                    without giving effect to the choice of law rules of the

     11.  MISCELLANEOUS PROVISIONS

          11.01     This Plan and any Agreement executed hereunder shall not be
                    deemed to constitute a contract of employment between an
                    Executive and TRW or a Participant and TRW, nor shall any
                    provision restrict the right of TRW to discharge an
                    Executive or Participant, or restrict the right of an
                    Executive or Participant to terminate employment.

                    includes the plural where appropriate.

          11.03     In order to be eligible to participate in this Plan, the
                    Participant and any person proposed as a Co-Insured shall
                    cooperate with the Insurer by furnishing any and all
                    information requested by the Insurer in order to facilitate
                    the issuance of the Policy, including furnishing such
                    medical information and taking such physical examinations as
                    the Insurer may deem necessary.  In the absence of such
                    cooperation, TRW shall have no further obligation to the
                    Participant to allow him to begin participation in the Plan.

          11.04     If a Participant (or a Co-insured, if the Participant's
                    Policy is a Survivorship Policy) commits suicide within two
                    years of the Participant Policy's issue, or if the
                    Participant  (or Co-insured, if the Participant's Policy is
                    a Survivorship Policy) makes any material misstatement of

                    information or nondisclosure of medical history and dies
                    within two years of the Participant's Policy's issue, then
                    no benefits will be payable to the beneficiary of such
                    Participant (or of the Participant's Assignee, where
                    applicable).

     12.  AMENDMENT, TERMINATION, ADMINISTRATION, AND SUCCESSORS

          12.01     AMENDMENT.  This Plan may be modified or amended by TRW at
                    any time, but an amendment which affects the rights,
                    benefits or obligations of a Participant (or his Assignee)
                    for whom TRW's obligation to pay premiums has become
                    irrevocable under Section 7.02 will not apply to such
                    Participant (or his Assignee) unless such Participant (or
                    his Assignee) consents, in writing, to the amendment.

          12.02     TERMINATION.  The Directors of TRW may terminate the Plan at
                    any time, but no such termination shall affect the rights,
                    benefits or obligations of a Participant (or his Assignee)
                    for whom TRW's obligation to pay premiums has become
                    irrevocable under Section 7.02 unless such Participant (or
                    his Assignee) consents, in writing, to such termination.

          12.03     ADMINISTRATION.  This is a life insurance plan maintained

                    and decide or resolve any and all questions, including
                    interpretations of the Plan, as may arise in connection with
                    the Plan in the Plan Administrator's sole discretion.  In
                    the administration of this Plan, the Plan Administrator may,
                    from time to time, employ agents and delegate to them or to
                    others (including Executives) such administrative duties as
                    it sees fit.  The Plan Administrator may from time to time
                    consult with counsel, who may be counsel to TRW.  The
                    decision or action of the Plan Administrator (or its
                    designee) with respect to any question arising out of or in

                    connection with the administration, interpretation and
                    application of this Plan shall be final and conclusive and
                    binding upon all persons having any interest in the Plan.
                    TRW shall indemnify and hold harmless the Plan Administrator
                    and any Executives to whom administrative duties under this
                    Plan are delegated, against any and all claims, loss,
                    damage, expense or liability arising from any action or
                    failure to act with respect to this Plan, except in the case
                    of gross negligence or willful misconduct by the Plan
                    Administrator.

          12.04     SUCCESSORS.  The terms and conditions of this Plan shall
                    inure to the benefit of and bind TRW and the Participant and
                    their successors, assignees, and representatives.

     13.  CLAIMS PROCEDURE; PLAN INFORMATION

          13.01     NAMED FIDUCIARY.  The Plan Administrator is hereby
                    designated as the named fiduciary under this Plan.  The
                    named fiduciary shall have authority to control and manage
                    the operation and administration of this Plan.

          13.02     CLAIMS PROCEDURES.  Any controversy or claim arising out of
                    or relating to this Plan shall be filed with the Plan
                    Administrator, TRW Inc., 1900 Richmond Rd., Lyndhurst, OH.
                    44124, Attention: Secretary.  The Plan Administrator shall
                    make all determinations concerning such claim.  Any decision
                    by the Plan Administrator denying such claim shall be in
                    writing and shall be delivered to all parties in interest in
                    accordance with the notice provisions of Section 10.02
                    hereof.  Such decision shall set forth the reasons for
                    denial in plain language.  Pertinent provisions of the Plan
                    shall be cited and, where appropriate, an explanation as to
                    how the claimant can perfect the claim will be provided.
                    This notice of denial of benefits will be provided within 90
                    days of the Plan Administrator's receipt of the claimant's
                    claim for benefits.  If the Plan Administrator fails to
                    notify the claimant of its decision regarding the claim, the
                    claim shall be considered denied, and the claimant shall
                    then be permitted to proceed with the appeal as provided in
                    this Section.

                    A claimant who has been completely or partially denied a
                    benefit shall be entitled to appeal this denial of his/her
                    claim by filing a written


                                      -11-

<PAGE>

                    statement of his/her position with the Plan Administrator no
                    later than sixty (60) days after receipt of the written
                    notification of such claim denial.  The Plan Administrator
                    shall schedule an opportunity for a full and fair review of
                    the issue within thirty (30) days of receipt of the appeal.
                    The decision on review shall set forth specific reasons for
                    the decision, and shall cite specific references to the
                    pertinent Plan provisions on which the decision is based.

                    Following the review of any additional information submitted
                    by the claimant, either through the hearing process or
                    otherwise, the Plan Administrator shall render a decision on
                    the review of the denied claim in the following manner:

                 a.      The Plan Administrator shall make its decision
                         regarding the merits of the denied claim within 60 days
                         following receipt of the request for review (or within
                         120 days after such receipt, in a case where there are
                         special circumstances requiring extension of time for
                         reviewing the appealed claim).  The Plan Administrator
                         shall deliver the decision to the claimant in writing.
                         If an extension of time for reviewing the appealed
                         claim is required because of special circumstances,
                         written notice of the extension shall be furnished to
                         the claimant prior to the commencement of the
                         extension.  If the decision on review is not furnished
                         within the prescribed time, the claim shall be deemed
                         denied on review.

                 b.      The decision on review shall set forth specific reasons
                         for the decision, and shall cite specific references to
                         the pertinent Plan provisions on which the decision is
                         based.

          13.03     AGENT FOR SERVICE OF PROCESS.  The agent for service of
                    process on the Plan shall be the Secretary, TRW Inc., 1900
                    Richmond Rd., Lyndhurst, Ohio 44124.  Service of legal
                    process may also be made upon the Plan Administrator at the
                    same address.

          13.04     PLAN YEAR.  The plan year of the Plan shall be the calendar
                    year.

          13.05     ERISA RIGHTS. As a participant in the Plan, you are entitled
                    to examine, without charge at the Plan Administrator's
                    office, all Plan documents filed for the Plan with the U. S.
                    Department of Labor, such


                                      -12-

<PAGE>

                    as annual reports, and obtain copies of all Plan documents
                    and other Plan information upon written request to the Plan
                    Administrator.  The Plan Administrator may make a reasonable
                    charge for the copies.  You are entitled to  receive a
                    summary of the Plan's annual financial report.  The Plan
                    Administrator is required by law to furnish each Participant
                    with a copy of this summary annual report.  In addition to
                    creating rights for Plan Participants, ERISA imposes
                    obligations upon the persons who are responsible for the
                    operation of the employee benefit plan.  These persons are
                    referred to as "fiduciaries" in the law.  Fiduciaries must
                    act in the interest of the Plan Participants and do so
                    prudently.  Fiduciaries who violate ERISA may be removed and
                    required to make good any losses they have caused the Plan.
                    Your employer may not fire you or discriminate against you
                    to prevent you from obtaining a benefit or exercising your
                    rights under ERISA.  If you are improperly denied a benefit
                    in full or in part, you have a right to file suit in a
                    federal or state court.  You may also file suit in federal
                    court if any Plan documents or any other materials you
                    requested are not received within 30 days of your written
                    request, and the court may require the Plan Administrator to
                    pay up to $100 for each day's delay until the materials are
                    received, unless the failure was beyond the control of the
                    Plan Administrator. If Plan fiduciaries are misusing the
                    plan's money, or if you are discriminated against for
                    asserting your rights, you have the right to file suit in
                    federal court or request assistance from the U. S.
                    Department of Labor.  The court will decide who should pay
                    court costs and legal fees.  If you are successful in your
                    lawsuit, the court may, if it so decides, require the other
                    party to pay your legal costs, including attorney's fees.
                    If you lose, the court may order you to pay these costs and
                    fees if, for example, it finds your claim is frivolous.  If
                    you have any questions about this statement or your rights
                    under ERISA, you should contact the Plan Administrator or
                    the nearest Area Office of the U. S. Labor-Management
                    Service Administration, Department of Labor.

                         THE TRW FINANCIAL COUNSELING PROGRAM

The TRW Financial Counseling Program was introduced because the complexity of
the tax laws and investment opportunities indicated a need for a capable
specialist to review the personal financial program of executives to assure
there is congruence with Company compensation programs.  Eligibility to
participate in the TRW Financial Counseling Program is limited to OIP I
participants.  Participation must be approved by a member of the Chief Executive
Office (CEO).

- --The program is comprehensive in scope and includes the following services:

- --Analysis of TRW compensation and benefit programs

- --Development of a financial and estate plan

- --Cash flow analysis

- --Insurance analysis

- --Tax strategy

- --Annual tax preparation

The Ayco Corporation is the financial counseling organization selected by TRW to
provide these services.  However, participants may elect to use any financial
counselor or tax preparer of their choice.

TRW will pay 100% of the cost of the Ayco counseling and tax preparation fee up
to a maximum amount determined annually.  For those who elect to use a financial
counselor other than Ayco, an annual maximum fee reimbursement schedule will be
determined annually.  Expenses up to the annual maximum will be charged to each
participant's budget.  Participants will be responsible for fees in excess of
the annual maximum.

Under applicable tax law, the portion of the fee paid by the Company is
considered income to the participant and will be included as imputed income on
the participant's W-2.  The Company Director of Employee Benefits will notify
participants of the annual reimbursement maximum.

Participation in the Program will end if membership is canceled by the CEO, with
termination of employment, or if the Program is canceled.  Participation will
continue for one year following retirement under the TRW Salaried Pension Plan.
Any exceptions must have the approval of the CEO.

Management's Discussion and Analysis of the Results of Operations and Financial
Condition

Results of Operations

Record sales in 1995 resulted in the company reporting the highest net earnings
and earnings per share in its history. Underscoring the strength of the year
were the record-breaking performances achieved in each of 1995's quarters.

Consolidated sales in 1995 of $10.2 billion rose 12 percent over 1994 sales of
$9.1 billion and  28 percent over 1993 sales of  $7.9 billion. Net earnings in
1995 increased to $446 million from  $333 million in 1994 and $195 million in
1993. Fully diluted earnings per share were $6.62 in 1995, $5.01 in  1994 and
$2.97 in 1993.

This year marked the second consecutive year that we achieved record levels of
sales, net earnings  and earnings per share. Sales in 1995 surpassed the $10
billion mark for the first time in our 95-year history. Our record results were
broadly based, led by record performance in automotive  and impressive growth in
space and defense. Automotive unit volumes continued to expand at a rate
exceeding global automotive growth, as the number of air bag modules sold
increased by 29 percent  and the number of power rack and pinion steering gears
produced increased by 12 percent. Space and defense results reflect our strong
market position as evidenced by the level of new contracts awarded during 1995.
New contract awards totaled $3.8 billion, with an additional $1.8 billion in
options. Increased productivity from all  our employees also contributed
significantly to the successful year.

Operating profit in 1995 was  $886 million, a 19 percent increase over 1994
operating profit of  $747 million and a 51 percent increase over 1993 operating
profit of $587 million, excluding restructuring. A detailed discussion of the
operating results of each industry segment is presented below.

Interest expense in 1995 was  $95 million compared to  $105 million in 1994 and
$138 million in 1993. The lower interest expense in 1995 was due to lower
average debt levels partially offset by higher U.S. interest rates. The decrease
in interest expense  from 1993 to 1994 was due to the reduction of  our
Brazilian debt and lower average debt levels  as well as lower foreign interest
rates.

The effective tax rate in 1995 was 37.0 percent, compared to 37.8 percent in
1994, and 38.7 percent in 1993. The lower effective tax rate in 1995 was
primarily attributable to prior year U.S. tax adjustments partially offset by
increased U.S. state and  local income taxes.

In 1993, the company adopted Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No.
112, "Employers' Accounting for Postemployment Benefits," and took a one-time
noncash charge of $25 million, or  $.38 per share, for the prior years'
cumulative

effect of the accounting change. Earnings before  the cumulative effect of the
accounting change  were $220 million or $3.35 per share.

The Financial Accounting Standards Board has issued Statement of Financial
Accounting Standards No. 121, "Accounting for the Impairment of Long-Lived
Assets and for Long-Lived Assets to Be Disposed Of." Statement No. 121
establishes accounting standards for determining the impairment of long-lived
assets to be held and used, certain identifiable intangibles, and goodwill
related to those assets and for long-lived assets  and certain identifiable
intangibles to be disposed of. The company is required to adopt Statement No.
121 during the first quarter of 1996. The financial statement effect of adoption
has not  yet been determined.

Automotive

Driven by growth in key product lines worldwide, 1995 was an outstanding year
for the automotive segment. Record sales of $6.5 billion in 1995 represented a
14 percent increase over 1994 sales  of $5.7 billion. Operating profit in 1995
increased  28 percent to a record $607 million from the  $476 million reported
in 1994. The increase in sales and operating profit was the result of higher
volume in the North American air bag and steering systems businesses and all
European automotive businesses, primarily in air bag and steering systems.
Favorable exchange rates also contributed to the sales increase.

Sales in 1994 rose to $5.7 billion, up 25 percent  from 1993 sales of $4.5
billion. Operating profit  in 1994 increased 56 percent to $476 million from the
$304 million reported in 1993, excluding restructuring. The increase in sales
was due to higher volume in the North American and European occupant restraint,
steering systems and automotive electronics businesses. The operating profit
increase was due to the higher volume in the North American  and European
occupant restraint and steering systems businesses.

Results of Operations (continued)

The company has and expects to continue to invest in areas of significant future
growth, such as air  bag systems, power rack and pinion steering and advanced
electronic components. In addition, TRW will continue to take advantage of the
increasing opportunities in the emerging markets of the world, including India,
the People's Republic of China and others, through internal growth and strategic
alliances.

TRW provides automotive systems and components with substantial value-added 
content to the worldwide automotive industry. The company anticipates that 1996 
North American automotive and light truck production will approximate 1995 
levels. We foresee continued modest production growth in Western Europe, and 
strong growth in the emerging markets of Eastern Europe and Asia. The diversity 
of our customers, markets and products, in conjunction with increased 
application rates in key product lines, will allow for continued growth 
throughout the world. We are dedicated to technological leadership, continuous 
improvement, reducing costs and break-even points, and focusing on consistent 
achievement of high quality in all of our products and services in order to 
strengthen our competitive position on a worldwide basis.

Space and Defense

Strong financial performance in space and defense was highlighted by an
outstanding year for new program awards. Sales in 1995 increased 10 percent to
$3.1 billion from the $2.8 billion reported in 1994. Operating profit of $192
million was  10 percent higher than 1994's operating profit of $175 million. The
strong  sales growth resulting from new contract awards and existing business
more than offset the effect of contracts nearing completion. The increase in
operating profit resulted primarily  from the absence of investments for new
business initiatives partially offset by lower fee accruals during the early
period of new programs and the net effect of program reserves.

Sales in 1994 of $2.81 billion increased from the 1993 sales of $2.79 billion.
Operating profit of $175 million was 14 percent lower than the operating profit
of $205 million reported in 1993, excluding restructuring. The sales increase
was due to higher volume in space and electronics, tactical reconnaissance
systems, and systems engineering programs. Partially offsetting the sales
increase  was the effect of several contract completions and terminations. The
operating profit resulting from  the higher volume and the absence of 1993
reserves for certain programs was more than offset by  investments for new
business opportunities and  the establishment of a contract reserve in 1994.

Continuing pressure on the Department of Defense, NASA and other U.S. Government
agency budgets could affect the level of future revenues and operating profits.
However, budgets were considerably more stable in 1995 than in recent years, and
we believe that this trend will continue in 1996  and the foreseeable future. We
feel strongly that  the company is well positioned for growth in our traditional
U.S. government markets, state and municipal governments, as well as commercial
and international markets.

Backlog estimates at the end of 1995 totaled  a record $4.87 billion, up 18
percent from the  $4.12 billion reported at the end of 1994. Reported backlog at
the end of 1995 does not include approximately $2.6 billion of negotiated and
priced, but unexercised, options for defense and non-defense programs.
Unexercised options at the end  of 1994 were valued at $1.0 billion. The
exercise  of options is at the discretion of the customer,  and, as in the case
of Government contracts generally, dependent on future government funding. The
impressive backlog growth was driven by  a number of key program wins in 1995
that are  of national importance and reflects a strong and healthy business that
is poised to deliver quality products and services for years to come.

Information Systems and Services

Sales in 1995 were $604 million compared to  $596 million in 1994. The sales
increase resulted primarily from higher volume in the Information Services
business partially offset by lower volume in the Information Systems business.
Operating profit of $87 million in 1995 represented a 10 percent decline from
the $96 million reported in 1994. The decline in operating profit resulted
primarily from the net effect of certain contract reserves in Information
Systems.

The operating profit of $96 million in 1994 represented a 24 percent increase
over 1993 operating profit of $78 million, excluding restructuring. Revenues of
$596 million declined 4 percent from the $618 million reported in 1993. The
revenue

Management's Discussion and Analysis of the Results of Operations and Financial
Condition

decline resulted from the absence of sales from a previously divested business. 
Higher volume in the Information Services business combined with continued cost 
controls contributed to the increase in operating profit. Operating profit in 
1994 also includes a gain on the sale of a product line partially offset by the 
establishment of certain contract reserves in  the Information Systems business.

The level of revenue and operating profit will remain sensitive to several key
U.S. economic variables including interest rates, consumer spending on durable
goods and housing activities. However, we believe revenue and operating profit
margins will continue to grow through new product offerings.

In February 1996, the company entered into an agreement to sell substantially
all of the businesses in the Information Systems and Services segment.
Management intends to use the net proceeds from the sale for general corporate
purposes, including working capital requirements, capital expenditures, business
expansion transactions, and the repurchase of securities  of the company. As the
impact of the proposed divestiture has not been fully determined, forward
looking discussions in this report do not reflect the above-mentioned sale.

International operations

International sales were $3.9 billion, or 39 percent  of TRW sales in 1995; $3.1
billion, or 35 percent of sales in 1994; and $2.5 billion, or 31 percent of
sales in 1993. U.S. export sales included in those amounts were $842 million in
1995, $638 million in 1994  and $438 million in 1993. Most of TRW's non-U.S.
operations are included in the Automotive segment and are located in Europe,
Canada, Brazil and the Pacific Basin. TRW's non-U.S. operations are subject to
the usual risks that may affect such operations; however, most of the assets of
its non-U.S. operations are in countries where the company believes such risks
to be minimal.

Liquidity and financial position

Cash flow from operations in 1995 of $869 million was used primarily for 
capital expenditures, the repayment of debt and dividend payments to 
shareholders. Debt at December 31, 1995 was  $754 million compared to $973 
million at the end of 1994. The ratio of total debt (short-term debt, current 
portion of long-term debt and long-term debt) to total capital (total debt, 
minority interests and shareholders' investment) was 25 percent at December 31, 
1995 compared to 34 percent at December 31, 1994. The percentage of fixed-rate 
debt to total debt, after the effect of interest rate swap agreements, was 77 
percent at the end of 1995.

TRW's non-U.S. operations are generally financed  by borrowings from banks or
through intercompany loans in the local currency of the borrower. There are no
significant restrictions on the remittance of funds by the company's non-U.S.
subsidiaries to the United States. A discussion of TRW's credit facilities is
contained in the "Debt and credit agreements" footnote in the Notes to Financial
Statements.

The company is subject to inherent risks attributed to operating in a global
economy. It is the company's policy to utilize derivative financial instruments
to manage its interest rate and foreign currency exchange risks. The company
uses derivatives to hedge its exposure to short-term interest rate changes as a
lower cost substitute  for the issuance of fixed-rate debt after taking  into
consideration account-related counterparty  risk. The company manages cash flow
transactional foreign exchange risk pursuant to a written corporate policy.
Forward contracts and to a lesser extent options are utilized to protect the
company's cash flow from adverse movements in exchange rates. The company is
exposed to credit loss in the event of nonperformance by the counterparties to
the derivative financial instruments. The company diversifies the counterparties
used as a means to limit this exposure and anticipates that the counterparties
will fully satisfy their obligations under the contracts. Derivative financial
instruments are viewed by the company as a risk management  tool and are not
used for speculative or trading purposes. The effect of derivative transactions
on the company's net earnings for each of the three years in the period ended
December 31, 1995 is  not material.

Capital expenditures were $485 million in 1995,  $506 million in 1994 and $482
million in 1993.  The company will maintain a capital program  with estimated
capital expenditures for 1996 totaling about $565 million. Approximately 70
percent of these expenditures will be invested in the Automotive segment, 26
percent in the Space and Defense segment and 4 percent in the Information
Systems and Services segment. The company will continue to invest in its
automotive growth businesses, including air bag systems, power rack and 


                                                                   TRW INC.   21

pinion steering and automotive electronic technologies. The balance of the 
capital expenditures will be used to acquire equipment to support  our existing 
customer base, develop advanced  and next generation technologies, acquire data 
processing hardware and expand our communications infrastructure.

On February 7, 1996, the Board of Directors authorized the company to repurchase
up to  10 million shares of TRW common stock on  the open market. The repurchase
will be funded primarily from the proceeds from the sale of  the businesses in
the Information Systems and Services segment, cash flow from operations  and the
issuance of debt. The company plans to purchase the shares from time to time,
depending  on market conditions. The shares repurchased  will be used to satisfy
the obligations of the company's various employee benefit plans and  other
proper corporate purposes.

We believe the company's current financing arrangements allow flexibility in
worldwide financing activities and permit us to respond to changing conditions
in credit markets. The existing arrangements are not indicative of the company's
potential borrowing capacity. We believe that funds generated from operations
and existing borrowing capacity  are adequate to support and finance planned
growth, capital expenditures, company-sponsored research and development
programs and dividend payments to shareholders.

Other matters

Federal, state and local requirements relating to  the discharge of materials 
into the environment,  or otherwise relating to the protection of the 
environment, have had and will continue to  have an effect on TRW and its 
operations. The company is conducting a number of environmental investigations 
and remedial actions at current and former company locations and, along with 
other companies, has been named a potentially responsible party for certain 
waste management sites. Each of these matters is subject to various 
uncertainties, and it is possible that some of these matters may be resolved 
unfavorably to the company. A reserve estimate for each matter is established 
using standard engineering cost estimating techniques. In the determination of 
such costs, consideration is given to the professional judgment of company 
environmental engineers in consultation with outside environmental specialists 
when necessary. At multi-party sites, the reserve estimate also reflects the 
expected allocation of  total project costs among the various potentially 
responsible parties. At December 31, 1995, the company had reserves for 
environmental matters  of $84 million, including $7 million of additional 
accruals recorded during the year. The company aggressively pursues 
reimbursement for environmental costs from its insurance carriers. However, 
insurance recoveries are not recorded as a reduction of environmental costs 
until they are fixed and determinable. At December 31, 1995, the "Other assets" 
caption on the balance sheet includes  $30 million of insurance recoveries 
related to environmental matters. The company believes that any liability that 
may result from the resolution of environmental matters for which sufficient 
information is available to support these cost estimates will not have a 
material adverse effect  on the company's future results of operations  and 
cash flows. However, the company cannot predict the effect on the company's 
future results  of operations and cash flows of expenditures  for aspects of 
certain matters for which there is insufficient information. In addition, the 
company cannot predict the effect of compliance with environmental laws and 
regulations with respect to unknown environmental matters on the company's 
future results of operations and cash flows or the possible effect of 
compliance with environmental requirements imposed in the future.

As of December 31, 1995, the company reduced the discount rate used to measure
the obligations for its pension and other postretirement benefit plans from 
8-1/2 percent to 7 percent, in recognition of lower prevailing long-term 
interest rates. The effect of the discount rate change on 1996 pension and other
postretirement benefit costs is not expected to be material. The determination
of pension and other postretirement benefit costs beyond 1996 will depend on
various factors, including long-term interest rates, investment returns, health
care cost trend rates, other actuarial assumptions, benefit levels, and
demographic changes.

Notes to Financial Statements

Summary of significant accounting policies

Principles of consolidation -- The financial statements include the accounts of
the company and its subsidiaries except for an insurance subsidiary. The wholly-
owned insurance subsidiary and the majority of investments in affiliated
companies, which are not significant individually or in the aggregate, are
accounted for by the equity method.

Use of estimates -- The preparation of financial statements in conformity with
generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates
and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and
disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities as of December 31, 1995 and
1994, respectively, and reported amounts of revenues and expenses for the years
ended December 31, 1995, 1994 and 1993, respectively. Actual results could
differ from those estimates.

Long-term contracts -- The percentage-of-completion (cost-to-cost) method is
used to estimate sales under fixed-price and fixed-price incentive contracts.
Sales under cost-reimbursement contracts are recorded as costs are incurred.
Fees based on cost, award fees and incentive fees are included in sales at the
time such amounts are reasonably estimable. Losses on contracts are recognized
when determinable.

Accounts receivable -- Accounts receivable at December 31, 1995 and 1994
included $507 million and $492 million, respectively, related to long-term
contracts, of which $253 million and $269 million, respectively, were unbilled.
Unbilled costs, fees and claims represent revenues earned and billable in the
following month as well as revenues earned but not billable under terms of the
contracts. A substantial portion of such amounts are expected to be billed
during the following year. Retainage receivables and receivables subject to
negotiation are not significant.

Inventories -- Inventories are stated at the lower of cost, principally the
first-in, first-out (FIFO) method, or market. Inventories applicable to long-
term contracts are not significant.

Depreciation -- Depreciation is computed over the assets estimated useful lives
using the straight-line method for the majority of the company's depreciable
assets. The remaining assets are depreciated using accelerated methods.

Intangible assets -- Intangible assets are stated on the basis of cost.
Intangibles arising from acquisitions prior to 1971 ($75 million) are not being
amortized because there is no indication of diminished value. Intangibles
arising from acquisitions after 1970 are being amortized by the straight-line
method principally over 40 years. Capitalized data files are amortized by the
straight-line method over periods not exceeding 15 years. The carrying value of
intangible assets is assessed for impairment on a quarterly basis.

Forward exchange contracts -- The company enters into forward exchange contracts
the majority of which hedge firm foreign currency commitments and certain
intercompany transactions. At December 31, 1995, the company had contracts
outstanding amounting to approximately $219 million denominated in the German
mark, the Italian lira, the British pound, the U.S. dollar and the French franc,
maturing at various dates through March 1997. Changes in market value of the
contracts are included in the basis of the transactions. The company is exposed
to credit loss in the event of nonperformance by the counterparties to the
foreign exchange contracts. No collateral is held in relation to the contracts
and the company anticipates that the counterparties will satisfy their
obligations under the contracts.

28   TRW INC.

<PAGE>

Summary of significant accounting policies (continued)

The fair value of long-term debt was estimated using discounted cash flow
analysis, based on the company's current borrowing rates for similar types of
borrowing arrangements. The fair value of interest rate and forward currency
exchange contracts is estimated based on quoted market prices of offsetting
contracts.

Environmental costs -- TRW participates in environmental assessments and
remedial efforts at operating facilities, previously owned or operated
facilities, and Superfund or other waste sites. Costs related to these locations
are accrued when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the
amount of that liability can be reasonably estimated. Estimated costs are
recorded at undiscounted amounts based on experience and assessments, and are
regularly evaluated as efforts proceed. Insurance recoveries are recorded as a
reduction of environmental costs when fixed and determinable.

Earnings per share -- Fully diluted earnings per share have been computed based
on the weighted average number of shares of common stock outstanding during each
year, including common stock equivalents (stock options) and assuming the
conversion of the Serial Preference Stock II - Series 1 and 3. Primary earnings
per share have been computed based on the weighted average number of shares of
common stock outstanding during each year including common stock equivalents.

Accounting change -- Effective January 1, 1993, the company adopted Statement of
Financial Accounting Standards No. 112, "Employers' Accounting for
Postemployment Benefits." The company recognized the cumulative effect of this
accounting change as of January 1, 1993, resulting in a one-time charge of $25
million (after a reduction for income taxes of $16 million).

</TABLE>

Company-funded research and development programs include research and
development for commercial products and independent research and development and
bid and proposal work related to government products and services. A portion of
the cost incurred for independent research and development and bid and proposal
work is recoverable through overhead charged to government contracts. Product
development costs include engineering and field support for new customer
requirements.

Restructuring

For balance sheet purposes, other accruals in 1995 and 1994 include $16 million
and $33 million, respectively, relating to restructuring reserves. The decline
in the reserve during 1995 resulted principally from the downsizing and
streamlining of certain businesses in the Automotive segment.

Restructuring expense in 1993 consists of restructuring charges of $23 million,
principally in the Automotive segment, resulting from additional management
decisions reduced by gains of $16 million from the sales of certain businesses
in the Automotive segment.

Income taxes (continued)

Deferred income taxes reflect the net tax effects of temporary differences
between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial reporting
purposes and the amounts used for income tax purposes. At December 31, 1995 and
1994, the company had unused tax benefits of $33 million and $40 million,
respectively, related to non-U.S. net operating loss carryforwards for income
tax purposes, of which $16 million and $23 million can be carried forward
indefinitely and the balance expires at various dates through 2000. A valuation
allowance at December 31, 1995 and 1994 of $27 million and $26 million,
respectively, has been recognized to offset the related deferred tax assets due
to the uncertainty of realizing the benefit of the loss carryforwards.

It is the company's intention to reinvest undistributed earnings of certain of
its non-U.S. subsidiaries and thereby indefinitely postpone their remittance.
Accordingly, deferred income taxes have not been provided for accumulated
undistributed earnings of $325 million at December 31, 1995.

Pension plans

The company has defined benefit pension plans (generally noncontributory except
for those in the United Kingdom) for substantially all employees. Plans for most
salaried employees provide pay-related benefits based on years of service. Plans
for hourly employees generally provide benefits based on flat-dollar amounts and
years of service.

Under the company's funding policy, annual contributions are made to fund the
plans during the participants' working lifetimes, except for unfunded plans in
Germany and certain non-qualified plans in the U.S. which are funded as benefits
are paid to participants. Annual contributions to funded plans have met or
exceeded ERISA's minimum funding requirements or amounts required by local law
or custom.

The company sponsors a contributory stock savings plan for which a majority of
its U.S. employees are eligible. The company matches employee contributions up
to 3 percent of the participant's qualified compensation. The company
contributions are held in an unleveraged employee stock ownership plan. The
company also sponsors other defined contribution pension plans covering
employees at some of its operations.

Postretirement benefits other than pensions

The company provides health care and life insurance benefits for a majority of
its retired employees in the United States and Canada. The health care plans
provide for cost sharing, in the form of employee contributions, deductibles,
and coinsurance, between the company and its retirees. The postretirement health
care plan covering a majority of employees who retired since August 1, 1988
limits the annual increase in the company's contribution toward the plan's cost
to a maximum of the lesser of 50 percent of medical inflation or 4 percent. Life
insurance benefits are generally noncontributory. The company's policy is to
fund the cost of postretirement health care and life insurance benefits in
amounts determined at the discretion of management. Retirees in certain other
countries are provided similar benefits by plans sponsored by their governments.

participants under age 65 and 9 percent for participants age 65 or older. The 
rates were assumed to decrease gradually to 6 percent and 5 percent, 
respectively, in the year 2009 and remain at that level thereafter. At December 
31, 1994, the 1995 annual rate of increase in the per capita cost of covered 
health care benefits was assumed to be 10 percent for participants under age 65 
and 9 percent for participants age 65 or older. The rates were assumed to 
decrease gradually to 6 percent and 5 percent, respectively, in the year 2021 
and remain at that level thereafter. A one percent annual increase in these 
assumed cost trend rates would increase the accumulated postretirement benefit 
obligation at December 31, 1995 by approximately 8 percent, and the aggregate 
of the service and interest cost components of net periodic postretirement 
benefit cost for 1995 by approximately 9 percent. The weighted average expected 
long-term rate of return on plan assets was 8 percent for 1995 and 9 percent 
for 1994. The trust holding the majority of the plan assets is not subject to 
federal income taxes.

TRW maintains a committed U.S. revolving credit agreement with 17 banks. The
agreement allows the company to borrow up to $550 million and extends through
February 2000. The interest rate under the agreement is either a negotiated
rate, the banks' prime rates, a rate based upon the banks' costs of funds in the
secondary certificate of deposit market or a rate based upon an Interbank
Offered Rate. TRW's commercial paper borrowings are supported by this agreement.
At December 31, 1995, there were no outstanding borrowings under the U.S.
revolving credit agreement. The weighted average interest rate on short-term
borrowings outstanding at December 31, 1995 and 1994 is 7.6 and 7.2 percent,
respectively.

The company also maintains a committed multi-currency revolving credit 
agreement with 13 banks. The agreement allows the company to borrow up to $200 
million and extends through February 2000. The interest rate under the 
agreement is based on various interest rate indices. At December 31, 1995, 
there were no outstanding borrowings under the multi-currency credit agreement. 
At December 31, 1995, $41 million of short-term non-U.S. borrowings have been 
reclassified to long-term non-U.S. borrowings because the company intends to 
refinance these borrowings on a long-term basis and has the ability to do so 
under its multi-currency revolving credit agreement.

As of December 31, 1995, the company has interest rate swap agreements for
notional borrowings of $135 million in which the company pays a fixed rate and
receives a floating rate. The weighted average pay rate and receive rate under
these agreements is 8.1 percent and 5.4 percent, respectively. These agreements
mature at various dates through 1998.

The floating rates under the interest rate swap agreements are both based on
commercial paper and LIBOR rates and have been calculated using these rates at
December 31, 1995. Net payments or receipts under the agreements are recognized
as an adjustment to interest expense. The company is exposed to credit loss in
the event of nonperformance by the counterparties to the interest rate swap
agreements. No collateral is held in relation to the agreements and the company
anticipates that the counterparties will satisfy their obligations under the
agreements.

The other medium-term notes bear interest at rates ranging from 5.98 percent to
9.25 percent and mature at various dates through 2020.

Non-U.S. borrowings bear interest, stated in terms of the local currency
borrowing, at rates ranging from 2.13 percent to 12.5 percent at December 31,
1995 and mature at various dates through 2004.

Debt and credit agreements (continued)

The maturities of long-term debt are, in millions: 1996-$80; 1997-$76; 1998-$16;
1999-$16; 2000-$52; and $381 thereafter.

The indentures and other debt agreements impose, among other covenants,
restrictions on funded debt and maintenance of minimum tangible net worth. Under
the most restrictive interpretation of these covenants, the payment of dividends
was limited to approximately $1,273 million at December 31, 1995.

Compensating balance arrangements and commitment fees were not material.

Lease commitments

TRW leases certain offices, manufacturing and research buildings, machinery,
automobiles and data processing and other equipment. Such leases, some of which
are noncancelable and in many cases include renewals, expire at various dates.
The company pays most maintenance, insurance and tax expenses relating to leased
assets. Rental expense for operating leases was $179 million for 1995, $164
million for 1994 and $162 million for 1993.

At December 31, 1995, future minimum lease payments for noncancelable operating
leases totaled $388 million and are payable as follows: 1996-$98; 1997-$78;
1998-$52; 1999-$35; 2000-$28; and $97 thereafter.

Capital stock

Serial Preference Stock II -- cumulative - stated at $2.75 a share; 5 million
shares authorized.

Series 1 -- each share convertible into 4.4 shares of common; redeemable at $104
per share; involuntary liquidation price $104 per share; dividend rate of $4.40
per annum.

Series 3 -- each share convertible into 3.724 shares of common; redeemable at

$4.50 per annum.

Series 4 -- not convertible into common shares; redemption price and involuntary
liquidation price of $125 per one one-hundredth of a share; annual dividend rate
per one one-hundredth of a share of the lesser of $4.00 or the current dividend
on common stock; no shares outstanding at December 31, 1995.

Common stock -- $0.625 par value; authorized 250 million shares; shares
outstanding were reduced by treasury shares of .6 million in 1995 and .4 million
in 1994.

TRW has a shareholder purchase rights plan under which each shareholder of
record as of January 6, 1989 received one right for each TRW common share held.
Each right entitles the holder, upon the occurrence of certain events, to buy
one one-hundredth of a share of Cumulative Redeemable Serial Preference Stock
II, Series 4, at a price of $125. Should certain additional events occur, each
right allows the shareholder to purchase $250 of the surviving entity's common
shares at a 50 percent discount. The company may redeem these rights at its
option at one cent per right under certain circumstances.

At December 31, 1995, 6.8 million shares of common stock were reserved for the
exercise and issuance of stock options and conversion of the Serial Preference
Stock II, Series 1 and 3. There were .7 million shares of Cumulative Redeemable
Serial Preference Stock II, Series 4, reserved for the shareholder purchase
rights plan.

Stock options

TRW has granted incentive and nonqualified stock options to certain employees to
purchase the company's common stock at the market price on the date of grant.
TRW accounts for stock options in accordance with APB Opinion No. 25,
"Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees." Subject to certain exceptions,
incentive stock options become exercisable to the extent of one-half of the
optioned shares for each full year of employment following the date of grant,
and 


                                                                   TRW INC.   35

Notes to Financial Statements

Stock Options (continued)

nonqualified stock options granted prior to 1987 become exercisable to the
extent of one-fourth of the optioned shares for each full year of employment
following the date of grant. Nonqualified stock options granted after 1986
become exercisable to the extent of one-third of the optioned shares for each
full year of employment following the date of grant. Generally, both incentive
and nonqualified stock options expire 10 years after the date of grant.

</TABLE>

At December 31, 1995, approximately 800 employees were participants in the
plans. As of that date, the average exercise price of options outstanding was
$52.89 per share and the expiration dates ranged from July 1996 to February
2005. The Company is currently planning to adopt the disclosure provisions of
Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 123, "Accounting for Stock-Based
Compensation" in 1996.

TRW grants performance share rights to certain employees under which the
employees are entitled to receive shares of the company's common stock based on
the achievement of a certain return on assets employed. The rights specify a
target number of shares which the employee would receive for each year that
goals for returns on assets employed are met. If the goals are exceeded, the
employee could receive up to 200 percent of the target shares, with the excess
over 100 percent payable in cash (unless the Compensation and Stock Option
Committee of the Board of Directors determines to pay the excess in shares). If
the goals are not met, the employee would receive fewer than the target shares
or no shares. At December 31, 1995 and 1994, the target number of performance
share rights granted to employees and still outstanding were .2 million and .4
million, respectively.

Contingencies

The company is subject to various investigations, claims and legal proceedings 
covering a wide range of matters that arise in the ordinary course of its 
business activities. In addition, the company is conducting a number of 
environmental investigations and remedial actions at current and former company 
locations and, along with other companies, has been named a potentially 
responsible party for certain waste management sites. Each of these matters is 
subject to various uncertainties, and some of these matters may be resolved 
unfavorably to the company. The company has established accruals for matters 
that are probable and reasonably estimable including $84 million for 
environmental matters at December 31, 1995. The company believes that any 
liability that may result from the resolution of environmental matters for 
which sufficient information is available to support cost estimates will not 
have a material adverse effect on the company's financial position. However, 
the company cannot predict the effect on the company's financial position of 
expenditures for aspects of certain matters for which there is insufficient 
information. In addition, the company cannot predict the effect of compliance 
with environmental laws and regulations with respect to unknown environmental 
matters or the possible effect of compliance with environmental requirements 
imposed in the future.

Further, product liability claims may be asserted in the future for events not
currently known by management. Although the ultimate liability from these
potential claims cannot be ascertained at December 31, 1995, management does not
anticipate that any related liability, after consideration of insurance
recovery, would have a material adverse effect on the company's financial
position.

Management and Auditors' Report
_______________________________________________________________________________

REPORT OF MANAGEMENT
_______________________________________________________________________________

Management of TRW is responsible for the preparation of the accompanying 
consolidated financial statements of the company and its subsidiaries. The 
financial statements have been prepared in conformity with generally accepted 
accounting principles and include the estimates and judgments of management. 
The financial statements have been audited by Ernst & Young LLP, independent 
auditors, whose report appears below.

Management has established and is responsible for maintaining a system of 
internal accounting controls that it believes provides reasonable assurance 
that assets are safeguarded and transactions are executed and recorded in 
accordance with management's authorization. The system is tested and 
evaluated regularly by the company's internal auditors as well as by the 
independent auditors in connection with their annual audit.

TRW has an audit committee composed of four directors who are not members of 
management. The committee meets regularly with management, the internal 
auditors and the independent auditors in connection with its review of 
matters relating to the company's financial statements, the company's 
internal audit program, the company's system of internal accounting controls 
and the services of the independent auditors. The committee also meets with 
the internal auditors as well as the independent auditors, without management 
present, to discuss appropriate matters. The committee also recommends to the 
directors the designation of the independent auditors.

REPORT OF ERNST & YOUNG LLP, INDEPENDENT AUDITORS
_______________________________________________________________________________

Shareholders and Directors
TRW Inc.

We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of TRW Inc. and 
subsidiaries as of December 31, 1995 and 1994, and the related consolidated 
statements of earnings, cash flows and changes in shareholders' investment 
for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 1995. These 
financial statements are the responsibility of the company's management. Our 
responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements based 
on our audits.

We conducted our audits in accordance with generally accepted auditing 
standards. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to 
obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free 
of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, 
evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. 
An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and 
significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall 
financial statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a 
reasonable basis for our opinion.

In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present fairly, in 
all material respects, the consolidated financial position of TRW Inc. and 
subsidiaries at December 31, 1995 and 1994, and the consolidated results of 
their operations and their cash flows for each of the three years in the 
period ended December 31, 1995, in conformity with generally accepted 
accounting principles.

As discussed in the notes to financial statements, effective January 1, 1993, 
the company changed its method of accounting for postemployment benefits.

Audited Financial Statements


THE TRW EMPLOYEE STOCK OWNERSHIP
AND STOCK SAVINGS PLAN



December 31, 1995 and 1994

<PAGE>

                         Report of Independent Auditors


Board of Administration
The TRW Employee Stock Ownership and
  Stock Savings Plan

We have audited the accompanying statements of net assets available for 
benefits of The TRW Employee Stock Ownership and Stock Savings Plan as of 
December 31, 1995 and 1994, and the related statements of changes in net assets 
available for benefits for the years then ended. These financial statements are 
the responsibility of the Plan's management. Our responsibility is to express 
an opinion on these financial statements based on our audits.

We conducted our audits in accordance with generally accepted auditing 
standards. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain 
reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of 
material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence 
supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. An audit 
also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant 
estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial 
statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis 
for our opinion.

In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present fairly, in 
all material respects, the net assets available for benefits of The TRW 
Employee Stock Ownership and Stock Savings Plan as of December 31, 1995 and 
1994, and the changes in net assets available for benefits for the years then 
ended, in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles.

Our audits were made for the purpose of forming an opinion on the basic 
financial statements taken as a whole. The accompanying supplemental schedule 
of assets held for investment purposes as of December 31, 1995, and the 
schedule of reportable transactions for the year then ended are presented for 
purposes of complying with the Department of Labor's Rules and Regulations for 
Reporting and Disclosure under the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 
1974, and are not a required part of the basic financial statements. The Fund 
Information in the statement of net assets available for benefits and the 
statement of changes in net assets available for benefits is presented for 
purposes of additional analysis rather than to present the net assets available 
for benefits and changes in net assets available for benefits of each fund. The 
supplemental schedules have been subjected to the auditing procedures applied 
in our audit of the 1995 financial statements and, in our opinion, are fairly 
stated in all material respects in relation to the 1995 basic financial 
statements taken as a whole.

                            Notes to Financial Statements
 
                                  December 31, 1995


A. SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

Investments in the TRW Stock Fund consist primarily of TRW Inc. (TRW) common 
stock which is traded on the New York Stock Exchange and valued at the last 
reported sales price on the last business day of the fiscal year.

Investments in the Equity Fund are valued at the redemption price established 
by the Trustee, which is based on the fair value of the Bankers Trust Pyramid 
Equity Index Fund assets. This Fund is constructed and maintained with the 
objective of providing investment results which approximate the overall 
performance of the Standard & Poor's Composite Index of 500 stocks. Income is 
accumulated and reinvested in the Fund and included in the determination of 
unit values.

The Insured Return Fund consists of fully benefit responsive investment 
contracts with insurance companies, banks and other financial institutions 
and short term investment funds. Benefit responsive contracts provide 
contract value payments for participant disbursements, loans and investment 
transfers as allowed under the plan. There are exceptions for payments to 
participants who, as a result of a corporate event, cease to be employed by 
TRW. A corporate event includes a divestiture of an operating unit (for 
example, a subsidiary or a division), a significant special early retirement 
program or other corporate action that could be construed as causing 
increased Plan payments to participants.

Investment contracts provide a stated rate of interest on principal for a 
stated period of time. All investment contracts are accounted for at contract 
value because they are fully benefit responsive. In accordance with Statement 
of Position 94-4, which the Plan adopted effective January 1, 1995, contract 
value equals fair value because no event has occurred that affects the value 
of any contracts. The investment contracts are of three types: general 
account, separate account, and synthetic investment contracts. Investment 
contracts in the general account of an insurance company where assets are not 
specifically identifiable have fixed rates of interest or an indexed rate of 
interest for the life of the contract. Investment contracts in separate 
accounts of an insurance company have underlying assets that are specifically 
identifiable and held for the benefit of the Plan. Under synthetic investment 
contracts, the Plan owns assets with an investment contract from an insurance 
company, bank or other financial institution surrounding the asset. Both 
separate account and synthetic contracts have periodic interest rate resets 
(monthly, quarterly, or semi-annually) based on the performance of the 
underlying assets. All separate account and synthetic contracts have a 
guaranteed return of principal. As of December 31, 1995 and 1994, 
approximately $159 and $223 million was invested in general account assets, 
$124 and $110 million in separate account assets, and $232 and $158 million 
in assets owned by the Plan, respectively.

A. SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES--CONTINUED

The weighted average yield (excluding administrative expenses) for all 
investment contracts was 6.95% in 1995 and 7.07% in 1994. The crediting 
interest rate for all investment contracts was 7.09% at December 31, 1995 and 
7.26% at December 31, 1994.

Investments in the Bond Index Fund are valued at the redemption price 
established by the Trustee, which is based on the fair value of the Bankers 
Trust Pyramid Intermediate Government Corporate Bond Index Fund. The Bankers 
Trust Pyramid Intermediate Government Corporate Bond Index Fund is 
constructed and maintained with the objective of providing investment results 
which approximate the overall performance of the high quality U.S. government 
and corporate bonds included in the Lehman Brothers Government/Corporate 
Index. Income is accumulated and reinvested in the fund and included in the 
determination of unit values.

Investments in the Small Company Equity Fund are valued at the redemption 
price established by the Trustee, which is based on the fair value of the 
Bankers Trust Pyramid Russell 2500 Index Fund Assets. The Small Company 
Equity Fund is constructed and maintained with the objective of providing 
investment results which approximate the overall performance of the 2,500 
common stocks included in the Russell 2500 Equity Index. Income is 
accumulated and reinvested in the Fund and included in the determination of 
unit values.

The cost of securities sold is determined by the average cost method for 
purposes of determining realized gains and losses.

B. DESCRIPTION OF THE PLAN

The Plan is a defined contribution plan, and is comprised of the TRW Stock 
Fund, Equity Fund, Insured Return Fund, Bond Index Fund and Small Company 
Equity Fund (the Funds). Participation in the Plan is available to 
substantially all domestic employees of TRW who have been employed for at 
least twelve months. Effective April 1, 1996, participants who have been 
employed for at least three months will be eligible for 
participation in the Plan. The Plan is governed by the Internal Revenue Code and
related legislation.

B. DESCRIPTION OF THE PLAN--CONTINUED

PARTICIPANT CONTRIBUTIONS

The Plan allows eligible employees to contribute up to 13% of qualifying 
compensation on a before-tax basis by way of salary reduction; such 
contributions are made in increments of one-tenth of one percent of 
qualifying compensation and could not exceed $9,240 in 1995 and 1994. 
Participants may also elect to contribute, in increments of one percent, up 
to 10% of qualifying compensation on an after-tax basis. Participants can 
make up to two contribution percentage changes per month. Annual 
contributions to a participant's account (including before-tax, after-tax and 
TRW matching contributions) and to any other defined contribution plan is 
limited to the lesser of $30,000 or 25% of the participant's annual 
compensation reduced by the amount of before-tax contributions.

Participants determine the funds in which to invest their contributions. 
Employee contributions may be invested, in multiples of 10% percent, in one 
or more of the five investment funds. Fund elections may be changed at any 
time.

TRW CONTRIBUTIONS

TRW contributes to the Plan each month, out of current or accumulated 
earnings, an amount equal to 100% of each participant's before-tax 
contributions for such month without exceeding three percent of the 
participant's qualifying compensation. Participants immediately vest in the 
TRW contributions. All TRW matching contributions are invested in the ESOP 
portion of the TRW Stock Fund. TRW contributions always remain in the TRW 
Stock Fund and may not be transferred. TRW contributions may be in the form 
of cash or treasury or authorized and unissued shares of TRW Common Stock. 
TRW Common Stock contributed is to be valued by any reasonable method 
selected by TRW.

WITHDRAWALS AND DISTRIBUTIONS

Upon termination of employment, a participant may elect to receive his or her 
account, less the unpaid balance of any loan outstanding, in a single sum or 
elect to defer the payment until the year following termination except a 
participant whose account balance exceeds $3,500 may defer such payments 
until he or she reaches age 70. Generally, distributions from the TRW Stock 
Fund will be paid only in whole shares of TRW Common Stock with the balance 
in cash. Participants who have less than 100 shares of TRW stock receive the 
value of their shares in cash unless they elect to receive shares.

If a participant elects to defer payment of his or her account, the 
undistributed account balance remains invested in the Plan. The following is 
the total value of the accounts subject to deferred elections (8,243 as of 
December 31, 1995 and 8,772 as of December 31, 1994) that are included in the 
net assets of the funds:

B. DESCRIPTION OF THE PLAN--CONTINUED

Effective January 1, 1988, participants who have attained age 55 as of the 
end of the preceding fiscal year-end and commenced participation in the Plan 
at least ten years prior may elect, within an election period during each of 
the succeeding five consecutive plan years, to receive a special ESOP 
distribution. The amount eligible for this special distribution is 50% of the 
prior fiscal year-end value (including previous withdrawals) of TRW Common 
Stock acquired for the participant's account by the ESOP since 1986, reduced 
by any previous withdrawals.

PARTICIPANT LOANS

Participants can borrow from $1,000 to $50,000 (in increments of $100) of 
their before-tax contributions, but such borrowings cannot exceed 50% of a 
participant's total Plan balance. The interest rate is fixed (prime rate at 
the end of the second to last business day of the quarter plus one percent) 
and the repayment period cannot be less than one year or more than five years.

OTHER

Although it has not expressed any intent to do so, TRW reserves the right to 
suspend or terminate the Plan. In the event of termination, the amount of 
each participant's account may be retained in trust for the benefit of the 
participant.

The above description of the Plan provides only general information. 
Participants should refer to the Summary Plan Description, which is available 
from the Stock Savings Plan's Participant Service Center, and annual 
prospectus for a more complete description of the Plan's provisions.

The preparation of the financial statements in conformity with Generally 
Accepted Accounting Principles requires the use of management's estimates.

Certain amounts in prior year financial statements have been reclassified to 
conform with current year presentation.

On a revalued basis, which is in accordance with Department of Labor Form 
5500 requirements, the realized and unrealized gains (losses) are not 
available at the date of the Report of Independent Auditors. A separate 
schedule will be included in the Form 5500 when filed.

D. ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES

Generally, salaries and wages of the administrative staff are paid by TRW. 
Expenses relating to investment advisor fees, management fees, trustee fees, 
audit fees, printing and postage are paid from Plan assets. Expenses directly 
attributable to any one fund are charged to that fund. Expenses not directly 
attributable to any one fund are allocated to each fund in the proportion 
that the market value of the assets of each fund bears to the total market 
value of all Plan assets. Brokerage fees and commissions incident to the 
purchase or sale of securities are paid by the fund in which they are 
incurred and are included in the cost of securities purchased or sold.

Plan's Board of Administration believes that the Plan is in operational 
compliance with the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 and will remain qualified 
and exempt from federal income taxes.

F. TRANSACTIONS WITH PARTIES-IN-INTEREST

investments managed by the Plan's Trustee, Bankers Trust Company.

At December 31, 1995 and 1994, the Bankers Trust Pyramid Equity Index Fund 
holds 164,386 and 193,086 shares of TRW Inc. Common Stock having a fair value 
of $12,739,915 and $12,743,676, respectively.

G. NUMBER OF PARTICIPANTS (UNAUDITED)--CONTINUED

The total number of participants in the Plan is less than the sum of the 
number of employees shown above because many are participating in more than 
one fund.

H. SUBSEQUENT EVENT

In February 1996, TRW entered into an agreement in principle to sell 
substantially all of the businesses in the Information Systems and Services 
segment. The sale, which is expected to result in a gain, is subject to the 
execution of a definitive agreement, corporate and regulatory approval, and 
other conditions.

                         REPORT OF INDEPENDENT AUDITORS





To the Participants and the Board of Administration of
THE TRW CANADA STOCK SAVINGS PLAN

We have audited the statements of financial condition of the TRW Stock Fund,
Pooled Money Market Fund Employees Profit Sharing Plan, Pooled Balanced Fund
Registered Retirement Savings Plan and Pooled Money Market Fund Registered
Retirement Savings Plan [constituting THE TRW CANADA STOCK SAVINGS PLAN] as at
December 31, 1995 and 1994 and the related statements of operations and changes
in fund equity for these funds for the years then ended.  These financial
statements are the responsibility of the company's management.  Our
responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements based on
our audits.

We conducted our audits in accordance with generally accepted auditing
standards.  Those standards require that we plan and perform an audit to obtain
reasonable assurance whether the financial statements are free of material
misstatement.  An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting
the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements.  An audit also includes
assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by
management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation.

In our opinion, these financial statements present fairly, in all material
respects, the financial position of the several funds of THE TRW CANADA STOCK
SAVINGS PLAN as at December 31, 1995 and 1994 and the results of their
operations and the changes in fund equity for the years then ended in accordance
with accounting principles generally accepted in Canada.

of participants shown above because many are participating in more than one
Fund.

2. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

These financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting
principles generally accepted in Canada, and are within the framework of the
accounting policies summarized below.

GAIN AND LOSSES ON INVESTMENTS

The realized gain or loss on disposition or transfer of an investment is
determined from the market value of the investment at the date of disposition or
transfer and the average cost base of that specific pool of investments prior to
the disposition or transfer.

Unrealized gains or losses are determined as the net effect of the change in
appreciation/depreciation of the investments from January 1 to December 31,
based on market values and the average cost base of each investment at those
respective dates.

INCOME RECOGNITION

Dividends are recognized as earned.

Interest income is recognized as it is earned consistent with the accrual basis
of accounting.


                                                                               2

3. INCOME TAXES

The Plan is exempt from Canadian federal income taxes under provisions of the
Income Tax Act.  Federal income tax consequences to the participants under the
Plan are as provided in the Income Tax Act.  TRW Canada Limited contributions
are taxable to the participants as is the income and all post-1971 capital gains
less post-1971 capital losses of the Plan, all of which are allocated to the
participants by the Trustee during the year, whether or not such amounts are
paid to the participants by the Trustee during the year.  In some circumstances,
the amounts taxable could exceed the amounts allocated.  The amount of foreign
non-business income tax paid on foreign source income by the trusts under the
Plan for the year is allocated to and deemed to have been paid by the
participants for Canadian federal income tax purposes.  Participants who are
non-resident taxpayers are subject to special rules depending on whether they
have performed duties in Canada during the year and are subject to 15%
withholding tax on amounts paid or credited to them under the Plan.

4. UNREALIZED AND REALIZED (LOSSES) GAINS

Investments are stated at their quoted market value.  The net unrealized
appreciation (depreciation) of investments included in fund equity is as
follows:
