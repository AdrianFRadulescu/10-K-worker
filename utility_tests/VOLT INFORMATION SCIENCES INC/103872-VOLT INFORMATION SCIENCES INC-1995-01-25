(a)      The results of operations for fiscal 1993 included a charge of
         $6,400,000 for costs not recoverable under two contracts for major
         directory assistance systems.  In fiscal 1994, the Company received
         customer acceptance under one of such contracts which had no effect on
         earnings in 1994, although revenue of $59,000,000 was recognized.

(b)      Operating results for fiscal 1992 include (i) a benefit of $1,070,000
         from the recovery of a portion of prior years' state business taxes
         applicable to the Technical Services and Temporary Personnel segment
         and (ii) a pretax charge of $722,000 relating to a portion of a
         facility under lease until fiscal 1994, which is no longer being
         utilized by the Telephone Directory segment.

(c)      In fiscal 1993, the Company entered into a three-year revolving
         financing agreement (see Note C of Notes to Consolidated Financial
         Statements) under which it sold a $25,000,000 undivided interest in a
         certain pool of accounts receivable.  As a result, the identifiable
         assets of the Technical Services and Temporary Personnel and the
         Telephone Directory segments were reduced by $23,000,000 and
         $2,000,000 in 1994, respectively and by $22,875,000 and $2,125,000 in
         1993, respectively.

Technical Services and Temporary Personnel

Volt's Technical Services and Temporary Personnel segment provides, from
approximately 135 offices located throughout the United States, technical and
temporary personnel services to a wide range of customers.

Volt Technical Services provides contract engineering services and
professional, engineering, design, data processing, scientific and technical
support personnel for varying periods of time to companies and other
organizations (including government agencies) in a broad range of industries
which have a need for such personnel, but are unable, or do not choose, to
engage such personnel as their own employees.  Volt Technical Services
furnishes services to such industries as the telecommunications, computer,
electronics, power (including certain nuclear and fossil fuel power plants),
aerospace, defense, marine, petrochemical, chemical, architectural, engineering
and transportation industries.  Customers are located throughout the United
States with a small portion of such services being performed outside the United
States.  Volt Technical Services maintains a computerized nationwide resume
data base  consisting of approximately 300,000 technical, professional,
scientific, and other candidates from which it fills customer job requirements.
These individuals become Volt Technical employees during the period of their
assignment (which typically ranges from a few months to several years).  As the
employer of record, Volt Technical Services is responsible for the  payment of
salaries, payroll taxes, workers' compensation and unemployment insurance and
benefit packages, which may include sick days, holiday and vacation pay and
medical insurance.

Volt Temporary Services provides temporary help in administrative, clerical, 
office automation, accounting, industrial and other job classifications to
clients for  short and long-term assignments.  Volt Temporary Services provides
clerks, typists, office automation personnel, secretaries, receptionists, sales
promotion personnel, bank personnel, telemarketers, data entry clerks,
inventory clerks, assemblers, warehousing personnel and other employees.  Volt
Temporary Services furnishes temporary employees to meet various client
requests, such as substituting during vacation and sick leave, staffing high
turnover positions, filling in during the full-time hiring process or during a
hiring freeze and staffing seasonal peaks, special projects, conversions,
inventories and offices that are phasing down.  It also provides management
personnel to coordinate special projects, thus relieving a customer of the need
to supervise temporary employees.  Volt Accounting Specialists, a department of
Volt Temporary Services, provides specialized temporary personnel in
accounting, bookkeeping and other financial classifications.  Volt Temporary
Services provides personnel to companies throughout a broad spectrum of
industries, including  finance, banking, insurance, telecommunications,
utility, petrochemical, computer, electronics, aerospace, defense, retailing,
manufacturing, universities and government agencies.  As in the case of
technical services employees, Volt, as the employer of record, is responsible
for the payment of salaries, payroll taxes, workers' compensation and
unemployment insurance and benefit packages, which may include sick days,
holiday and vacation pay and medical insurance.

Beginning in fiscal 1994, a substantial portion of the Volt Temporary Services
and Volt Technical Services offices have combined into Volt Services Group to
satisfy customer requests for a single source provider of all levels of
temporary help.  This change also reflects the expanding range of services
offered to customers and the focus on providing these expanded services as a
full service supplier, including outsourcing services, as well as assuming full
responsibility for staffing, supervision and even productivity of large
projects.  The consolidation of services under the umbrella of Volt Services
Group also enables the segment to bid on certain contracts where customers
insist on a single source provider which is a full-service organization.  All
remaining offices of Volt Temporary Services and Volt Technical Services expect
to undergo the change to Volt Services Group during fiscal 1995.

During the week ended October 28, 1994, this segment employed approximately
19,000 people in furnishing services.

The segment is not dependent upon a single customer or a few customers, the
loss of which might have a materially adverse effect upon its business.
Although the markets for the segment's services include a broad range of
industries throughout the United States, general economic difficulties in
specific geographic areas or industrial sectors have in the past, and could in
the future, affect the profitability of this segment.

The segment competes with many technical service and temporary personnel
firms, some of which are larger than Volt, as well as with individuals seeking
direct employment.  The ability of Volt to compete successfully for customers
depends on its reputation, price and quality of service provided and its
ability to engage, in a timely manner, personnel meeting customer
requirements.  Many of the contracts entered into by this segment are of
relatively short duration and competition is intense.  Many of the contracts
under which the segment operates are awarded on the basis of competitive
proposals.  Although Volt has been successful in obtaining contracts in the
past, there can be no assurance that Volt will receive additional or
replacement contracts on satisfactory terms.

Electronic Publication and Typesetting Systems

Volt, through its 99%-owned subsidiary, Autologic, Incorporated ("Autologic"),
designs, develops, manufactures, markets and services computerized imagesetting
and publication systems equipment and software, primarily for the newspaper,
publishing and commercial printing industries and for companies and other
organizations having internal publishing facilities.  Autologic's products
are also utilized by certain of Volt's other segments.  Foreign marketing and
servicing are provided directly by Autologic, through foreign subsidiaries and
branches, and by independent foreign distributors.

During fiscal 1994, Autologic's sales revenues increased by 10%, reflecting
significantly increased sales in the Australian and Latin American markets.
These increased sales were the result of improved local economic conditions,
increased sales and marketing efforts and competitive product offerings.
Revenues from sales in the United States and Europe were up slightly during the
year.  Although the number of units were up significantly in all geographic
areas, the sales mix included more lower-priced units.





                                     - 6 -
<PAGE>   7

Increased sales revenues were also offset by declining prices and margins on
equipment and service sales.  Technological advancements, "open system"
architecture and general market conditions have created a market where price
competition is commonplace.

As part of Autologic's program to increase its presence in the commercial
publication market while retaining its position in the technologically advanced
newspaper market, the US domestic sales force is being enlarged to focus on
commercial accounts, the product line has been expanded to support large format
(up to 34" x 44") multiple page imaging, direct-to-plate products have been
introduced focused on commercial printers and publishers, and services have
been augmented to address customer training, color system production and
network installation.

Autologic has successfully made the transition from selling principally
proprietary systems to being an industry leader in PostScript imaging systems.
(PostScript is a registered trademark of Adobe Systems Incorporated).  Under
original equipment manufacturer license agreements, Autologic designs,
manufactures, sells and supports PostScript image systems which operate
independently or in conjunction with Autologic's proprietary PIP products.  The
SoftPIP product line is completely PostScript Level 2-compliant and is known
for high performance, image quality, and reliability in high volume production
environments.

In response to the rapidly changing open system environment which dominates the
marketplace today, Autologic improved the performance and functional
capabilities of its computer server products during fiscal 1994.  Highlights
include introduction of the APS-200 providing APS-100 capabilities on standard
platforms with significantly improved system performance, integration of
PostScript Level 2 features by the APS-200 OPI Server, support of mixed PC
Windows and Apple Macintosh workstation environments, and expanded graphic data
formats supported by the OPI Server.

The Company has developed a library of more than 2,000 digitized typefaces,
known as "fonts," which are stored on computer disks and licensed to purchasers
of Autologic typesetters.  These fonts are offered in PIP and PostScript
formats, as well as for Autologic's earlier systems. CD-ROM-based PostScript
fonts created by Autologic, using the Company's and other licensed typefaces,
are also made available.
        
The manufacture of Autologic-built subassemblies and all system assembly is
performed in Autologic's facilities in Thousand Oaks, California.  This segment
purchases certain completed subassemblies and manufactures others.  Most of the
parts and subassemblies used in the production of this segment's products are
purchased from numerous suppliers and are integrated into Autologic products.

Autologic maintains a worldwide technical support and service organization
which supports and services the full range of Autologic products.  Technical
support is headquartered in Thousand Oaks, California, with regional offices
located throughout the United States, in London, England, and in Sydney,
Australia.  Wholly-owned subsidiaries operate in Australia, New Zealand, the
United Kingdom, Germany, France, Spain, Sweden and Israel.  Local distributors
and agents sell and service Autologic products in the remainder of the
worldwide markets and Autologic has recently expanded its network of
distributors and agents with a view to increasing sales worldwide, especially
in areas of emerging economic growth.





                                     - 7 -
<PAGE>   8

Autologic's position in its markets depends largely upon its reputation, the
quality, design and pricing of its products, the timeliness of its deliveries,
and its field service.  The markets in which the segment competes are marked by
rapidly changing technology and, although Volt continues its investment in
research and development, there is no assurance that this segment's present or
future products will be competitive, that the segment will continue to develop
new products or that present products or new products can be successfully
marketed.
        
The market for this segment's products is highly competitive and price
competition is intense.  A number of firms, some of which are substantially
larger and have substantially greater financial resources than Volt,
manufacture one or more products competing with one or more of the segment's
products.  Some of these competitors sell their products as complete systems,
for some of which Autologic has no competing system.
        
The Company holds several patents and trademarks related to this segment's
products, but does not believe that these patents or trademarks are material to
the segment.
        
Export sales represented approximately 46% of Autologic's sales in fiscal 1994,
43% in fiscal 1993 and 46% in fiscal 1992.  In the past, Autologic has been
adversely affected by general economic recessions in the United States and in
other countries where Autologic products are sold.  In addition, a significant
portion of Autologic's business is in the newspaper publishing industry, which
has in the past, experienced significant revenue downturns during recessions.
These downturns resulted in reductions in capital expenditures by that
industry, adversely affecting Autologic's performance.

Telephone Directory

Volt's Telephone Directory segment, utilizing highly specialized proprietary
automated systems which it developed for directory management and production,
together with phototypesetting systems manufactured by  Autologic, implements
and maintains the database, produces digitized display advertisements and
photocomposes pages with integrated graphics for yellow and white pages
directories.  These services are performed for a number of the regional
telephone operating companies, independent directory publishers and others.
Volt believes that it is a leading independent producer of yellow pages
directories for telephone companies in the United States.

The segment also provides directory management systems and various
photocomposition services to a number of regional telephone and independent
directory publishers, licenses production system software to directory
publishers and provides commercial services, such as composition and data
processing and database management services, to other customers.

The Telephone Directory segment markets these proprietary directory management
and production systems, customized to meet the needs of publishers who desire
to perform their work in-house.  The systems are marketed to publishers
incorporating "workflow management" by which ads are automatically routed
between workstations, increasing throughput and control.





                                     - 8 -
<PAGE>   9
The segment separately markets workstations which are used to facilitate the
creation of telephone directories.  These include a graphics workstation
(RAD-GRAF), containing Volt-developed software, that facilitates incorporating
special graphic effects in the presentation of ads for merging text and
graphics on a finished page.  Another workstation is the Real-time Incolumn
Display (RID) workstation, on-line electronic galley editors which allow last
minute alterations and insertions of ads and listings, while displaying the
composed results as they will appear on the finished page.

Services  are rendered under various short and long-term contracts and are
performed primarily at facilities maintained by Volt in Blue Bell,
Pennsylvania; Indianapolis, Indiana; Anaheim and San Diego, California; and, in
one instance, at the customer's facility.
        
The segment also produces, publishes and prints white pages and yellow pages
directories, sells yellow pages advertising and performs commercial printing in
Uruguay.  In addition, Volt's DataNational division publishes community and
university classified directories in the United States.

Volt's Advanced Technologies, Research & Development division provides the
services of researching and implementing new product lines and adopting new
computer technology for internal office automation and business processing
automation.  It also provides consulting services and hardware and systems
technical support for other segments of Volt.

This segment faces intense competition with respect to all of these services
and products from other suppliers and from in-house facilities of potential
customers.  Some of its significant competitors are companies which are
larger and have substantially greater financial resources than Volt.  This
segment's sales to one customer represented approximately 23% of the total
sales of this segment for the 1994 fiscal year.  The loss of this customer,
unless replaced, would have an adverse effect on this segment's business.

Volt's ability to compete in its Telephone Directory segment depends upon its
reputation, technical capabilities, price, quality of service and ability to
meet customer requirements in a timely manner.  Volt believes that its
competitive position in this segment's areas of operations is augmented by its
ability to draw upon the expertise and resources of its other segments.  
Certain of the services rendered by Volt's Telephone Directory segment require
highly trained technical personnel, and there can be no assurance that the
Company will continue to be able to employ sufficient technical personnel
necessary for the successful conduct of such services.  A substantial portion
of Volt's business is obtained through submission of competitive proposals.
While the segment has obtained various short and long-term contracts, margins
under such contracts have decreased in many instances, certain contracts have
expired and there can be no assurance that contracts will be renewed on
satisfactory terms or that additional or replacement contracts will be awarded
to the Company.

Engineering and Construction

Volt's Voltelcon division furnishes a wide range of telecommunications
services, including engineering, construction, maintenance, installation,
removals and distribution of telecommunications products.  Its customers are
telephone operating companies, interexchange carriers, alternative local
transport carriers, telecommunications equipment manufacturers, cable
television and electric power companies, government units and private entities.
It performs these services primarily in the central office and outside plant
and at end user premises.  The market in which Voltelcon operates is highly
competitive, often resulting in low margins.

Volt's Advanced Technology Services division was established in 1994 to meet
the critical challenges of the "Information Super Highway" and the evolutionary
merging of voice, data and video services to telephony, broadband and other
providers of information system services, such as telephone companies,
interexchange carriers, government and private industry.

This segment faces intense competition with respect to all of its
telecommunications services from other suppliers and from in-house capabilities
of potential customers.  This segment experienced increased sales and realized
a profit in fiscal 1994, as compared to an operating loss in fiscal 1993. Some
of its significant competitors are larger and have substantially greater
financial resources than Volt.  Other competitors are small, local companies
with lower overhead.  This segment's sales to each of two customers represented
approximately 29% of the total sales of this segment for the 1994 fiscal year.
The loss of either of these customers, unless replaced, might have an adverse
effect on this segment's business.

Volt's ability to compete in this segment depends upon its reputation,
technical capabilities, price, quality of service and ability to meet customer
requirements in a timely manner.  Volt believes that its competitive position
in this segment is augmented by its ability to draw upon the expertise and
resources of other Volt segments.  A substantial portion of the segment's
business is obtained through submission of competitive proposals.  While the
segment has obtained various short-term contracts, margins have decreased in
many instances.  There can be no assurance that such contracts will be renewed
on satisfactory terms or that additional or replacement contracts will be
awarded to the Company.
        
Computer Systems

The Computer Systems segment is comprised of Volt Delta Resources and Volt
Viewtech.

Volt Delta Resources ("Volt Delta") is engaged in the design, programming, sale
and/or lease, and maintenance of computer information systems and services,
primarily for the telecommunications and utility industries.  The main office
of this segment is located in New York City and its principal research and
development facility is located in Orange, California.  Volt Delta operates as
two business units:  Information Systems and Maintech.





                                     - 10 -
<PAGE>   11

During fiscal 1992, Volt Delta's Information Systems division brought to market
its new generation directory assistance system, marketed as DOSS (Delta
Operator Services System).  The new generation system allows telecommunications
customers to interface interactively with voice response units through the
touch tone pad of their telephones and via limited voice recognition
technology.  These features provide new revenue sources to the telephone
company from such applications as call completion, customized intercept and
automated directory assistance.  Although the basic DOSS system is offered to
customers, typically each customer will require some special features, and in
some instances, extensive customization.

The DOSS system operates on Tandem Computer's NonStop fault tolerant platform,
using Tandem's relational database technology, which allows telecommunications
companies to significantly expand the content of their databases in support of
enhanced information services, while continuing to achieve subsecond response
using Volt Delta's Xm retrieval software.  This software employs a process
proprietary to Volt Delta.  Although the physical implementation of this
process has been patented by Volt Delta with the United States Patent Office,
Volt Delta's competitors may be able to provide similar services to customers
without infringing on such patent.
        
In May 1991, Volt Delta entered into a contract with a major United States
telephone company to provide a DOSS system.  Delivery and installation at the
customer's premises began during fiscal 1992 and continued during fiscal 1993
and 1994.  System acceptance by this telephone company was obtained in the
fourth quarter of fiscal 1994.

During fiscal 1993, a pilot DOSS system was installed at a second
telecommunications customer and is being used commercially.  In fiscal 1994, a
follow-up production system was delivered to that customer and is in the
process of final acceptance testing.

During 1993 and 1994, Volt Delta entered into additional contracts for DOSS and
DOSS related functionality with other telecommunications customers, one of
which is based in the United Kingdom, which are in various stages of
implementation.

Volt Delta's service division, Maintech, offers third party maintenance (TPM)
and other services to customers who have purchased computers and peripherals
from others, as well as those who have purchased or leased information systems,
including DOSS, from Volt Delta.  Maintech is headquartered in Wallington, New
Jersey and provides TPM services on a national basis.  Regional offices and
spare parts inventory facilities are located in Wallington, New Jersey and
Orange, California, with district service centers located throughout the
country and, in some instances, at customers' facilities.

Volt's Viewtech subsidiary provides energy and water conservation systems and
services, including custom information systems.  In recent years, Viewtech has
expanded its traditional electric and gas utility markets to include water
utilities and has made substantial upgrades to Viewtech's information system
and energy audit software.  Viewtech is headquartered in Orange, California,
and operates through four regional offices, located in Boston, Massachusetts;
Little Rock, Arkansas; Southfield, Michigan; and San Francisco, California,
with project offices located throughout the country.





                                     - 11 -
<PAGE>   12


In order to fulfill its commitments under its contracts, Volt Delta is required
to develop advanced computer software programs and purchase substantial amounts
of computer and related equipment manufactured by unaffiliated corporations.
Much of the equipment required for these contracts is purchased as needed.
Except for Tandem's computer equipment, equipment used by Volt Delta is readily
available from a number of suppliers.

This segment's sales to its two largest customers in fiscal 1994, under a
number of different contracts, represented approximately 64% (which includes
one-time revenues described in Note L of Notes to Consolidated Financial
Statements) and 10%, respectively, of the segment's total revenues. Inability
to sell additional major systems would have an adverse effect on this segment's
business.

The business environment in which this segment operates is highly competitive.
Some of this segment's principal competitors are considerably larger than Volt
and have substantially greater financial resources.  This segment's position in
its market depends largely upon its reputation, quality of services and ability
to develop, maintain, and implement information systems on a cost competitive
basis.
        
These services require highly trained technical personnel, certain
classifications of which are currently in short supply.  There can be no
assurance that this segment will be able to obtain additional contracts or
additional orders under existing contracts, or that it will continue to be able
to employ sufficient personnel necessary for the successful conduct of its
business.

Joint Ventures

A subsidiary of the Company is a shareholder in Pacific Access Pty. Ltd.
("Pacific Access"), an international joint venture company in Australia.  This
venture, which commenced operations in July 1991, assumed responsibility
throughout Australia for the marketing, sales and compilation functions of all
yellow pages directories of Telstra Corporation Ltd., the Australian
Government-owned telephone company, under the terms of a twelve-year contract.
Telstra Corporation Ltd. owns fifty percent of the voting common stock of
Pacific Access, while subsidiaries of Volt, Southwestern Bell, Bell Canada and
Edward H. O'Brien Industries each hold twelve and one-half percent.

In July 1994, the Company acquired an interest, consisting of 50% of the common
shares and 75% of the redeemable preferred shares and debt, in Telelistas
Editora Ltda., a Brazilian company which has a long-term contract to publish
the official White Pages, Yellow Pages and Street Guides for the City of Rio de
Janeiro on behalf of TELERJ, the government-owned telephone company.

Effective February 28, 1994, the Company sold its 50% interest in Pacific Volt
Information Systems, a joint venture, for approximately $16,400,000, to its
joint venture partner.  The sale resulted in a gain of $9,770,000 ($5,760,000,
net of income taxes, or $1.20 per share). Therefore, results of operations for
the fiscal year 1994 includes only four months of income attributable to this 
joint venture.
        
For further information concerning the Company's operations and joint ventures
see "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of
Operations."

Research and Development

During the Company's 1994, 1993, and 1992 fiscal years, the Company expended
approximately $6,262,000, $5,830,000, and $5,694,000, respectively, on research
and development, all of which is Company sponsored.  The major portion of
research and development  expenditures are incurred in the Electronic
Publication and Typesetting Systems segment, the Telephone Directory segment
and the Computer Systems segment.

Customers

One customer represented more than 10% of the revenues for the year ended
October 28, 1994.  The customer accepted a major directory assistance system
from the Computer Systems segment and used various services and products which,
under the completed-contract method of accounting, represented 11% of the
Company's consolidated revenues in fiscal 1994 (including one-time revenues
described in Note L of Notes to  Consolidated Financial Statements).

Seasonality

Historically, the Company's results of operations have been lower in the first
fiscal quarter as a result of reduced requirements for its technical and
temporary personnel due to the holiday season.  In addition, Pacific Access
(see "Joint Ventures" above) produces a major portion of its revenues and
significantly all of its profits in the Company's second and third fiscal
quarters.  The Uruguayan telephone directory operation produces a major portion
of its revenues and most of its profits in the Company's fourth fiscal quarter,
and the DataNational telephone directory operation is adversely affected in the
Company's first fiscal quarter due to the seasonality of its directory-closing
schedule.

Employees

During the week ended October 28, 1994, Volt employed approximately 23,000
persons, including approximately 19,000 persons who were on temporary
assignment for the Technical Services and Temporary Personnel segment.  Volt is

*  See Note G of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for information
regarding a term loan secured by these properties.

In addition, the Company leases space in approximately 150 other facilities
throughout the United States and Europe (excluding month-to-month rentals),
each of which consists of less than 10,000 square feet. These leases expire at
various times from 1995 until 2000 (with one, in the United Kingdom, expiring
in 2010).

At times, the Company leases space to others in the buildings which it owns if
it does not then require the space for its own business.

The Company believes that its facilities are adequate for its presently
anticipated requirements and that it is not dependent upon any individually
leased premises.

For additional information pertaining to properties, see Note I of Notes to
Consolidated Financial Statements.

  returns for the fiscal years 1980 through 1988.  Accordingly, $1,473,000 ($.30
  per share), included in the liability for income taxes at November 2, 1990
  applicable to such years in excess of the amount payable as a result of the
  examination, has been included as a tax benefit in fiscal 1991.

  During fiscal 1990, the Company discontinued its full-service reproduction and
  printing operations.  The net sales of the discontinued operations were
  $1,382,000 in the fiscal year 1990.  The loss from discontinued operations of
  $449,000 was reduced by income tax benefits of $175,000 and the loss on
  disposal of $1,002,000 was reduced by income tax benefits of $391,000.  The
  results of fiscal 1990 include $1,493,000 ($.16 per share) as a result of
  settlements of litigation and an insurance claim in excess of the carrying
  value of assets destroyed and costs incurred due to a fire in a foreign
  branch.

ITEM 7.   MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL
          CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

The information which appears below relates to prior periods, the results of
operations for which periods are not necessarily indicative of the results
which may be expected for any subsequent periods.  Management has made no
predictions or estimates as to future operations and no inferences as to future
operations should be drawn.  The following discussion should be read in
conjunction with the Industry Segment Data in Item 1 of this Report and the
Consolidated Financial Statements and Notes thereto which appear in Item 8 of
this Report.

Results of Operations

Revenue in fiscal 1994 increased by $169,313,000 or 30% from fiscal 1993 as
sales increased by  $162,763,000 or 29%.  The 1994 results include revenues of
$59,000,000 from the completion of a long-term contract.  Revenue in fiscal
1993 increased by $34,606,000 or 7% from fiscal 1992 as sales increased by
$37,422,000 or 7% and joint venture and other income declined.

In fiscal 1994, the Company had income of $19,827,000 from operations before
income taxes and extraordinary items compared to a loss of $5,594,000 from
operations before income taxes and a cumulative effect of a change in
accounting in fiscal 1993 and income from operations before income tax of
$1,775,000 in fiscal 1992.  The 1994 results include a $9,770,000 pretax gain
on the sale of a joint venture.  The 1993 results included a $6,400,000 pretax
charge for non recoverable costs under a large contract.

The extraordinary item in fiscal 1994 was a loss of $271,000 due to the early
redemption at par of $30,000,000 face value of the Company's 12-3/8%
Subordinated Debentures.

The cumulative effect of a change in accounting of $959,000 in fiscal 1993 was
due to the Company adopting Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No.
109, "Accounting for Income Taxes".  

The net income in fiscal 1994 was $11,773,000 compared to a net loss in fiscal 
1993 of $2,715,000 and net income of $1,091,000 in fiscal 1992.

Operating profit was $22,982,000 in fiscal 1994 compared to $7,566,000 in
fiscal 1993 and $12,365,000 in fiscal 1992.  (See Industry Segment Data in Item
1 of this Report and Note J of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in
Item 8 of this Report).

A discussion of the sales and operating profit (loss) of the Company's industry
segments follows:

The Technical Services and Temporary Personnel segment's sales increased by
$92,905,000 or 27% in fiscal 1994 to $434,510,000 and by $20,218,000 or 6% in
fiscal 1993 to $341,605,000. Operating profit of the segment increased by
$8,977,000 or 122% to $16,337,000 in fiscal 1994 and by $1,405,000 or 24% to
$7,360,000 in fiscal 1993.  The increase in sales in fiscal 1994 and 1993 was
attributable to continued increased business over a broad spectrum with
existing customers and placements with new customers.  The operating profit
increase in fiscal 1994 and 1993 was due to the increased sales volume which
was partially offset by increases in overhead to support the additional sales
and improved gross margins.  In addition, in fiscal 1992, this segment's
operating profit was favorably impacted by a reversal of prior years' business
tax expenses of $1,070,000.  Although the markets for the segment's services
include a broad range of industries throughout the United States, general
economic difficulties in specific geographic areas or industrial sectors have
in the past, and could in the future, affect the profitability of this segment.

ITEM 7.   MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL
          CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS--Continued

The Electronic Publication and Typesetting Systems segment's sales increased by
$5,983,000 or 10% to $65,323,000 in fiscal 1994 and increased by $1,854,000 or
3% to $59,340,000 in fiscal 1993. The sales increases in fiscal 1994 and 1993
were primarily due to increased equipment sales in domestic and overseas
markets. Despite the increase in sales, operating profits decreased by
$706,000 or 35% in fiscal 1994 to $1,334,000 primarily due to lower gross
margins resulting from product mix and competitive pressures. Operating
profits increased by $986,000 or 94% in fiscal 1993 to $2,040,000. The 1993
operating profit increased due to the increased sales and cost and expense
reductions offset by a slight decline in gross margins. The markets in which
the segment competes are marked by rapidly changing technology and, while the
Company continues its investment in research and development, there is no
assurance that this segment's present or future products will be competitive,
that the segment will continue to develop new products or that present products
or new products can be successfully marketed.

The Telephone Directory segment's sales decreased by $4,789,000 or 6% to
$74,155,000 in fiscal 1994 and increased by $7,949,000 or 11% to $78,944,000 in
fiscal 1993.  In fiscal 1994, the segment's operating profit decreased by
$1,458,000 or 18% to $6,695,000.  In fiscal 1993, the segment's operating
profit increased by $1,609,000 or 25% to $8,153,000. The 1994 sales decline is
primarily due to the absence in 1994 of revenue from the sale of automated
directory systems which occurred in 1993, partially offset by increased
independent directory sales by the segment's DataNational division and a 4%
increase in telephone directory production.  The 1993 sales increase was
primarily due to increases in the Uruguayan operation and the sales of
automated directory management systems where revenues doubled, while telephone
directory production revenue declined by 3%, due to certain contracts expiring
in 1993.  The operating profit decline in 1994 was due to the absence in 1994
of high margin automated directory system shipments made in 1993.  The
operating profit increased in fiscal 1993 due to the increased sales volume and
overhead cost reductions. This segment's services are rendered under various
short and long-term contracts.  A contract for services that expired in the
fourth quarter of fiscal 1992 has been renewed with lower gross margins.  A
contract with a customer that generated $9 million in revenue in fiscal 1994
expires in early fiscal 1995 and will not be renewed.  Other contracts expire
in fiscal 1995 through 1997, and there can be no assurance that they will be
renewed or replaced on similar terms.

The Engineering and Construction segment's sales increased by $5,203,000 or 11%
to $52,676,000 in fiscal 1994 and by $11,165,000 or 31% to $47,473,000 in
fiscal 1993.  In fiscal 1994 the segment had a profit of $792,000 compared to a
loss of $1,128,000 in 1993 and a loss of $2,885,000 in 1992. The 1994 sales
increase was due to increases in the Advanced Technology Services division and
installation services partially offset by a decline in engineering revenue.
The fiscal 1993 sales increase was due to increased construction and
installation services offset by declines in engineering revenue. Operating
results improved in fiscal 1994 and 1993 due to increased sales volume and
improved gross margins. The segment operates in intensely competitive markets
and there can be no assurance that this segment will continue to be profitable.

ITEM 7.   MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL
          CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS--Continued


The Computer Systems segment's sales increased by $61,554,000 or 164% to
$99,135,000 in fiscal 1994 and decreased by $1,243,000 or 3% to $37,581,000 in
fiscal 1993. The segment's operating loss narrowed in 1994 by $6,381,000 or
75% to $2,168,000 from $8,549,000 in 1993.  The 1994 sales increased due to
customer acceptance and revenue recognition of $64,500,000 on two major Delta
Operator Service Systems (DOSS) and increased maintenance revenue.  Operating
profit improved in 1994, primarily due to a $6,400,000 charge in 1993 for costs
not recoverable on two contracts, the revenue for one of which was recognized
in 1994, and profit on a second contract recognized in 1994 and increased
maintenance revenues.  During fiscal 1993, a pilot DOSS system was installed at
another telecommunications customer and is now being used commercially by the
customer.  In fiscal 1994, a follow-up production system was delivered to that
customer and is in the process of final acceptance testing.  In fiscal years
1993 and 1994, the segment was awarded several additional contracts, two of
which necessitated the opening of a new branch facility.  There can be no
assurance that the Company will be able to obtain additional contracts or
additional orders under existing contracts.

Interest income decreased by $45,000 or 3% in fiscal 1994 and by $171,000 or
11% in fiscal 1993.  The decrease in both years was primarily due to reduced
funds available for investments in interest-bearing securities, and in 1993,
lower prevailing interest rates.

The Company's share of the income of its joint ventures was $3,055,000 in 1994,
a decrease of $1,885,000 or 38%, and $4,940,000 in 1993, a decrease of
$1,867,000 or 27%.  In February 1994, the Company sold for $16,400,000 its 50%
interest in Pacific Volt Information Systems, a joint venture, which composed
telephone directories in California under a contract that was due to expire in
1996.  The sale resulted in a pretax gain of $9,770,000.  The results for the
twelve months include only four months of income attributable to this joint
venture or $661,000 compared to $2,327,000 in 1993 and $3,824,000 in 1992.
Profits of the joint venture were down 39% in 1993 due to reduced sales.  The
Company's share of the income of the Australian joint ventures declined in 1994
by 1%, and in 1993 by 12%, primarily due to an arrangement which ended in 1993
in which the Company's share of the joint venture's income exceeded its 12-1/2%
ownership.  The Australian venture produces a major portion of its revenues and
significantly all of its profits in the Company's second and third fiscal
quarters.

Selling and administrative expenses increased by $2,967,000 or 7% to
$43,075,000 in 1994 and by $1,181,000 or 3% to $40,108,000 in 1993 to support
the increased sales activities. These expenses expressed as a percentage of
sales were  6.0%, 7.2% and 7.5% for fiscal years 1994, 1993 and 1992,
respectively.

ITEM 7.   MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL
          CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS--Continued


Research and development expenses increased by $432,000 or 7% to $6,262,000 in
1994 and $136,000 or 2% to $5,830,000 in 1993.  The 1994 increase was due to
additional product development by the Computer Systems segment, partially
offset by decreases in the Telephone Directory and Electronic Publication and
Typesetting Systems segments.  The 1993 increase was attributable to the
Telephone Directory segment.

Depreciation and amortization increased by $554,000 or 5% to $10,745,000 in
1994 and decreased by $932,000 or 8% to $10,191,000 in 1993.  The 1994 increase
is due to increased fixed asset expenditures in 1993 and 1994 while the 1993
decrease is due to reduced fixed asset expenditures in earlier years.

Foreign exchange loss in fiscal year 1994 was lower than 1993 due to relative
stability of European currency markets in 1994.  The gain in fiscal year 1992
was primarily attributable to bank debt denominated in Uruguayan currency which
was highly volatile.

Interest expense decreased by $3,610,000 or 33% to $7,468,000 in 1994 and by
$491,000 or 4% to $11,078,000 in 1993.  The decreases in 1994 and 1993 were due
to reductions in the interest rate on a mortgage loan and to the repurchase of
a portion of the Company's 12-3/8% Subordinated Debentures.  The Company has
established additional financing at lower costs through the sale of accounts
receivable which enabled the Company to call and redeem $20,000,000 of
debentures in November 1993 and, as a result of the sale of a 50% joint
venture, an additional $10,000,000 in May 1994.  In fiscal 1994 and 1993, other
income was reduced by a charge of $1,557,000 and $849,000 respectively, for
costs incurred in conjunction with the sale of accounts receivable (see Note C
of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements).

The cumulative effect of a change in accounting for income taxes of $959,000
relates to the adoption by the Company of Statement of Financial Accounting
Standards No. 109, "Accounting for Income Taxes", in the first quarter of 1993.
Due to the uncertainty as to their future utilization, tax benefits have not
been recognized for certain loss and credit carryforwards, by establishing a
valuation allowance which will be periodically evaluated.  See Note F of Notes
to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information including 
information concerning the Company's effective tax rates for fiscal 1992 
through fiscal 1994.

Liquidity and Capital Resources

Cash and cash equivalents decreased by $24,032,000 in fiscal year 1994 to
$17,049,000 due to the reduction of long-term debt and purchases of investments
and property, plant and equipment partially offset by cash provided from
operations and proceeds from the sale of a joint venture.  Working capital
increased by $750,000 in fiscal 1994 to $61,839,000 at October 28, 1994.

The Company believes that its current financial position, working capital and
future cash flows will be sufficient to fund operations and satisfy its debt
obligations.  The Company has a $7,000,000 credit line with a domestic bank
under a revolving credit agreement which expires in November 1995, unless
renewed.  The Company has outstanding bank borrowings of $4,925,000 at October
28, 1994.  In October 1993, the Company called, and in November 1993 redeemed,
$20,000,000 of its 12-3/8% Subordinated Debentures (see Note G of Notes to
Consolidated Financial Statements).  In May 1994, the Company redeemed an
additional $10,000,000 of the debentures which, together with previously
redeemed and repurchased debentures, satisfied all future sinking fund
requirements.  The Company repaid its $15,400,000 mortgage loan which was due
in December 1994 and entered into a $10,000,000 five-year loan agreement which
is secured by a deed of trust on land and buildings.

At October 28, 1994, the Company's investment portfolio included investments at
carrying value of $8,095,000.

The Company has no material capital commitments.  The Company may determine,
from time to time in the future, to buy additional shares of its Common Stock
and/or Debentures in the market or in privately negotiated transactions.

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT AUDITORS

Board of Directors
Volt Information Sciences, Inc.



We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Volt
Information Sciences, Inc.  and subsidiaries as of October 28, 1994 and October
29, 1993, and the related consolidated statements of operations, stockholders'
equity, and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended October
28, 1994.  Our audits also included the financial statement schedule listed in
the Index at Item 14(a).  These financial statements and schedule are the
responsibility of the Company's management.  Our responsibility is to express
an opinion on these statements and schedule based on our audits.

We conducted our audits in accordance with generally accepted auditing
standards.  Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to
obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of
material misstatement.  An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence
supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements.  An audit
also includes assessing the accounting principle used and significant estimates
made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement
presentation.  We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our
opinion.

In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present
fairly, in all material respects, the consolidated financial position of Volt
Information Sciences, Inc. and subsidiaries at October 28, 1994 and October 29,
1993, and the consolidated results of its operations and its cash flows for
each of the three years in the period ended October 28, 1994, in conformity
with generally accepted accounting principles.  Also, in our opinion, the
related financial statement schedule, when considered in relation to the basic
financial statements taken as a whole, presents fairly in all material respects
the information set forth therein.

As discussed in Note F to the consolidated financial statements, in 1993, the
Company changed its method of accounting for income taxes, in accordance with
Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 109 "Accounting for Income
Taxes."

                                                               Ernst & Young LLP

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

NOTE A--SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

Fiscal Year:  The Company's fiscal year consists of the 52 or 53 weeks ending
on the Friday nearest October 31.  The 1994, 1993 and 1992 fiscal years were
comprised of 52 weeks.

Consolidation:  The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of
the Company and its subsidiaries.  All significant intercompany transactions
have been eliminated upon consolidation.  The Company has investments in joint
ventures which are accounted for by the equity method.

Revenue Recognition:  Generally, sales are recorded when products are shipped
and when services are rendered.  Revenues and costs applicable to long-term
contracts, including those providing for software customization or 
modification, are recognized on the percentage-of-completion method, measured
by work performed or the completed-contract method, as appropriate.  Provisions
for estimated losses on contracts are recorded when such losses become evident.

Cash Equivalents:  Cash equivalents consist of investments in short-term,
highly liquid securities having an initial maturity of three months or less.

Inventories:  Manufacturing inventories are priced at the lower of cost or
market.  Such inventory costs include material, labor and factory overhead and
are based upon standard costs which approximate average costs.  Accumulated
unbilled costs on service contracts are carried at the lower of actual cost or
realizable value.

Property, Plant and Equipment:  Depreciation and amortization are provided on
the straight-line and accelerated methods at rates calculated to write off the
cost of the assets over their estimated useful lives.  Fully depreciated assets
are written off against their related allowance accounts.  The assets are
depreciated over the following periods:

   Buildings                  - 25 to 31-1/2 years
   Machinery and equipment    - 3 to 7 years
   Leasehold improvements     - length of lease or life of asset, whichever is
                                shorter

Intangible Assets:  Intangible assets principally consist of the unamortized
balances of the excess of cost over the fair value of the net assets of
companies acquired.  The intangibles are being amortized using the
straight-line method over five to forty years, principally over fifteen years.

NOTE A--SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES--Continued

Income Taxes:  Effective at the beginning of fiscal year ended October 29,
1993, the Company changed its method of accounting for income taxes to the
liability method in accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards
No. 109, "Accounting for Income Taxes" (see Note F).

Translation of Foreign Currencies:  The U.S. dollar is the Company's functional
currency throughout the world except for the Company's Uruguayan operation and
its joint ventures in Australia and Brazil.  Where the U.S. dollar is used as
the functional currency, and in Uruguay and Brazil, which have high inflation
rates, foreign currency gains and losses are included in operations.
Translation adjustments due to the Company's investment in its Australian joint
venture, whose functional currency is its local currency, are recorded as a
separate component of stockholders' equity.

Per Share Data:  Per share data are computed on the basis of the weighted
average number of shares of common stock outstanding and, if applicable, the
assumed exercise of dilutive outstanding stock options based on the treasury
stock method.


NOTE B--INVESTMENTS IN SECURITIES

Effective October 28, 1994, the Company adopted the provisions of Statement of
Financial Accounting Standards No. 115, "Accounting for Certain Investments in
Debt and Equity Securities" issued by the Financial Accounting Standards Board
in May 1993.  Adoption of Statement No. 115 did not have a material effect on
the Company's financial statements.  In accordance with the statement,
management determines the appropriate classification of debt securities at the
time of purchase and re-evaluates such designation as of each balance sheet
date.  Debt securities are classified as held-to-maturity when the Company has
the positive intent and ability to hold the securities to maturity.
Held-to-maturity securities are stated at amortized cost.  Marketable equity
securities and debt securities not classified as held-to-maturity are
classified as available-for-sale.  Available-for-sale securities are carried at
fair value with the unrealized gains and losses, net of tax, reported as a
separate component of stockholders' equity.  At October 28, 1994, short-term
investments consist principally of bank certificates of deposit which mature
within one year and are intended to be held to maturity.  Non-current
investments at such date consist principally of U.S. treasury notes maturing in
1997 classified as available-for-sale.  At October 28, 1994, the Company's
portfolio of marketable securities had a market value of $8,095,000 and an
amortized cost of $8,172,000.  Gross unrealized holding losses of $77,000 are
shown as a reduction of stockholders' equity.  At October 29, 1993, portfolio
securities, which consisted principally of U.S. treasury notes and commercial
paper, were carried at an amortized cost of $7,762,000 with a market value of
$7,835,000.

NOTE C--ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE

On October 6, 1993, the Company entered into a three-year agreement to sell, on
a limited recourse basis, up to $25,000,000 of undivided interests in a
designated pool of certain eligible accounts receivable.  As collections reduce
previously sold undivided interests, new receivables may be sold up to the
$25,000,000 level.  At October 28, 1994 and October 29, 1993, $25,000,000 of
accounts receivable had been sold under this agreement.  The sold accounts
receivable are reflected as a reduction of receivables in the accompanying
balance sheets.  The net cash proceeds of sale are reported as an operating
cash flow in the accompanying statements of cash flows.  The Company pays fees
based on the purchaser's borrowing costs incurred on short-term commercial
paper which financed the purchase of receivables.  Other income (expense) in
the accompanying 1994 and 1993 statements of operations includes fees
(including professional fees in 1993) related to the agreement of $1,557,000
and $849,000, respectively.

The purchaser may terminate the agreement on a minimum of six months' notice.
In addition, the agreement may be terminated if the Company does not maintain a
minimum tangible net worth, as defined, and a maximum ratio of debt to tangible
net worth.

credited against the related costs in inventory.  Substantially all of the
amounts billed have been collected.

NOTE E--SHORT-TERM BORROWINGS

The Company has a credit line with a domestic bank which provides for unsecured
borrowings and letters of credit up to an aggregate of $7,000,000.  The Company
borrows from foreign banks, primarily supported by letters of credit provided
by the domestic bank.  On December 2, 1994, the Company entered into a
revolving credit agreement which extended the credit line to November 1995,
unless renewed, and contains various financial covenants.  At October 28, 1994,
the Company has outstanding domestic bank borrowings of $700,000 ($1,310,000 -
1993) and foreign bank borrowings of $4,225,000 ($4,897,000 - 1993).  The
weighted average interest rate of short-term borrowings at each year-end was
35.4% in 1994 and 23.5% in 1993.  The weighted average interest rates are high
due to a high proportion of the borrowings by the Uruguayan operation, whose
interest rates are commensurate with their high inflation level.  Borrowings in
Uruguay are used to hedge receivables against a loss in value due to the 
strengthening of the U.S. dollar against the Uruguayan currency.


NOTE F--INCOME TAXES

Effective as of the beginning of fiscal 1993, the Company adopted Statement of
Financial Accounting Standards No. 109, "Accounting for Income Taxes".  Under
this method, deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on
differences between financial reporting and the tax bases of assets and
liabilities and are measured using tax rates and laws that are scheduled to be
in effect when the differences are scheduled to reverse.  Prior to the
adoption, income tax expense was determined using the liability method
prescribed by Statement No. 96, which is superceded by Statement No. 109.
Among other changes, Statement No. 109 changes the recognition and measurement
criteria for deferred tax assets included in Statement No. 96.

As permitted by Statement No. 109, the Company has elected not to restate the
financial statements of any prior years.  The cumulative effect of adopting
Statement No. 109 at the beginning of the 1993 fiscal year was to increase net
income by $959,000, or $.20 per share, including $432,000 attributable to a
corporate joint venture (see Note M). For the year ended October 29, 1993,
application of the new income tax rules increased pretax income by
approximately $189,000 primarily due to the ability of the Company's Australian
corporate joint venture to recognize and measure deferred tax assets.

NOTE F--INCOME TAXES--Continued

Deferred income taxes reflect the net tax effects of temporary differences
between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial reporting
purposes and the amounts used for income tax purposes.  Significant components

NOTE F--INCOME TAXES--Continued

As of October 28, 1994, for tax purposes, the Company had domestic net
operating loss carryforwards of $2,258,000, which expire in 2001, and foreign
tax credit carryforwards of $2,124,000, which expire from 1996 through 1999.
In addition, a foreign subsidiary had net operating loss carryforwards of
$295,000 which expire in 1995 and 1996.  For financial statement purposes, a
valuation allowance has been recognized to offset the deferred tax assets
related to these carryforwards.  The valuation allowance at October 28, 1994,
includes $104,000 of tax benefits attributable to the pre-acquisition losses of
an acquired subsidiary, which, when recognized, will be applied to reduce
goodwill related to the acquisition.

The valuation allowance was decreased during fiscal 1994 by $867,000 primarily
as a result of the utilization of domestic net operating loss carryforwards,
partially offset by additional foreign tax credit carryforwards, which arose
during such year, whose use is subject to limitations.  The utilization of the
net operating loss resulted in a $479,000 reduction to income tax expense and a
$479,000 reduction to goodwill.  The valuation allowance was increased in
fiscal 1993 by $940,000 primarily as a result of additional foreign tax credit
carryforwards, which arose during such year, whose use is subject to
limitations.

Income taxes are provided on the undistributed earnings of the Australian
corporate joint venture, as remittances of such earnings are anticipated.
Undistributed earnings of foreign subsidiaries ($2,375,000) at October 28, 1994
are considered permanently invested and, accordingly, no federal income taxes
have been provided.  Should these earnings be distributed, foreign tax credits
would reduce the additional federal income tax which would be payable.
Availability of tax credits is subject to limitations; accordingly, it is not
practicable to estimate the amount of the deferred tax liability on such
accumulated earnings.

(a)  The debentures provide for interest to be paid semi-annually on January 1
and July 1 and are redeemable at the option of the Company, in whole or in
part, at 100% plus accrued interest.  In October 1993, as a result of a
financing agreement (see Note C), the Company called for the redemption and, in
November 1993, redeemed $20,000,000 principal amount of debentures.  In May
1994, the Company redeemed an additional $10,000,000 of the debentures which,
together with previously redeemed and repurchased debentures, satisfied all
future sinking fund requirements.   The early redemptions, at par, resulted in
an extraordinary loss of $271,000, net of income tax benefits of $157,000, due
to the write-off of related discount and issuance costs.  The debentures are
subordinated to all existing and future senior indebtedness (as defined) of the
Company.  At October 28, 1994, the amount available for dividends, pursuant to
the terms of the indenture under which the debentures are issued, was
$23,538,000 and, if no dividend payments are made, the amount available for
capital stock repurchases was $33,538,000.  However, under the terms of a term
loan agreement, at such date, only $5,289,000 was available for such payments
(see (b) below).

(b)  In October 1994, the Company repaid its $15,400,000 mortgage liability to
Chemical Bank, which was due on December 22, 1994.  Concurrently, the Company
entered into a $10,000,000 five-year loan agreement with National Westminster
Bank which is secured by a deed of trust on land and buildings (book value at
October 28, 1994 - $15,958,000).  The term loan bears interest at 7.86% per
annum and is repayable in twenty quarterly principal installments of $500,000
together with interest.  In October 1996, if certain conditions are met, the
loan may be extended for two years with a subsequent reduction of principal
payments to $225,000 per quarter and a final payment of $1,725,000 due October,
2001.  The agreement contains various financial covenants, the most restrictive
of which requires the Company to maintain a tangible net worth of $79,000,000.
The obligation is of two subsidiaries and is guaranteed by the Company.

The fair value of the Company's total debt as of October 28, 1994, and October
29, 1993  approximated the carrying value based upon quotations obtained for
the debentures and the maturity and terms of the other debt.

Rent expense for fiscal years 1994, 1993 and 1992 was $10,075,000, $9,741,000
and  $10,037,000, respectively.  Many of the leases also require the Company to
pay or contribute to property taxes, insurance and ordinary repairs and
maintenance.

The Company has guaranteed the performance of a subsidiary under a contract and
also guaranteed the commitments of a joint venture.  At October 28, 1994,
outstanding letters of credit of $4,976,000 were issued by banks in support of
these guarantees which were secured by $4,000,000 of the Company's short-term
investments.  The letters of credit expire in fiscal 1995, unless renewed, and
the Company believes that risk of loss relative to these financial guarantees
is remote.

NOTE J--INDUSTRY SEGMENTS

Financial data concerning the Company's sales, operating profit (loss) and
identifiable assets by industry segments for the fiscal years 1994, 1993 and
1992 are presented in tables under Item 1 of Form 10-K and are included herein
by reference.

The Company operates primarily in five industry segments: Technical Services
and Temporary Personnel; Electronic Publication and Typesetting Systems;
Telephone Directory; Engineering and Construction; and Computer Systems.  Total
revenues include both sales to unaffiliated customers, as reported in the
Company's consolidated statements of operations, and intersegment sales. Sales
between segments are generally priced at cost.

Operating profit (loss) is comprised of total revenues less operating expenses.
In computing operating profit (loss), none of the following items have been
added or deducted:  general corporate expense; interest expense; fees related
to sales of accounts receivable; corporate interest income and income taxes.
Identifiable assets are those assets that are used in the Company's operations
in each industry segment.  Corporate assets consist principally of cash and
cash equivalents, investments and investments in joint ventures.

NOTE K--QUARTERLY RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (UNAUDITED)--Continued

(a) In the second quarter of 1994, the Company sold its 50% interest in Pacific
Volt Information Systems, a joint venture, for approximately $16,400,000.  The
sale resulted in a gain of $9,770,000 ($5,760,000, net of income taxes or $1.20
per share).

(b) In the fourth quarter of fiscal 1994, the Company received acceptance from
two customers for major directory assistance systems.  The results of
operations for 1993 included principally, for one of these customers, a charge
of $2,100,000 ($.28 per share) in the third quarter of fiscal 1993 and
$4,300,000 ($.58 per share) in the fourth quarter of fiscal 1993 for costs not
recoverable.  As a result, acceptance of that customers system had no effect on
the Company's earnings in 1994, although revenue of $59 million was recognized
in the fourth quarter of 1994.

(c) In the fourth quarter of fiscal 1993, the Company entered into a three-year
revolving financing agreement under which it sold a $25,000,000 undivided
interest in a designated pool of certain accounts  receivable.  A pretax charge
of $849,000 ($.11 per share) for professional and bank fees was incurred in
connection with the agreement.

Historically, the Company's results of operations have been adversely affected
in the first fiscal quarter, as a result of reduced requirements for its
technical and temporary personnel due to the holiday season.  An Australian
joint venture (see Note M) produces a major portion of its revenues and
significantly all of its profits in the Company's second and third fiscal
quarters.

NOTE L--CERTAIN SIGNIFICANT ITEMS INCLUDED IN OPERATIONS

The results of operations for 1993 include a pretax charge of $6,400,000 ($.87
per share) for costs not recoverable under two contracts for major directory
assistance systems.  In fiscal 1994, the Company received customer acceptance
under one of such contracts, which, because of the pretax charge in the
previous year, had no effect on the Company's earnings for 1994, although
revenue of $59,000,000 was recognized in 1994.  Revenue from this customer
recognized during fiscal 1994 represented approximately 11% of the Company's
total revenue for such year.  Operations in 1993 also included a pretax charge
of $849,000 ($.11 per share) incurred in connection with a revolving financing
agreement (see Note C).

Operations in fiscal 1992 include income from the recovery of a portion of
prior years' state business taxes of $1,070,000 ($.15 per share) and a pretax
charge of $722,000 ($.10 per share) relating to a portion of a facility under
lease until fiscal 1994 which is no longer being utilized.

NOTE M--SUMMARIZED FINANCIAL INFORMATION OF JOINT VENTURES

The Company owns 12-1/2% of the voting stock of Pacific Access Pty. Ltd.
("Pacific Access"), an international joint venture in Australia.  This venture,
which commenced operations in July 1991, assumed responsibility throughout
Australia for the marketing, sales and compilation functions of all yellow
pages directories of Telstra Corporation Ltda., ("Telstra"), the Australian
Government-owned telephone company, under the terms of a twelve-year contract.
Telstra owns 50% of the voting stock of Pacific Access.  In the event of a
change in control of the Company, as defined, the Company may be required to
sell its shares in the venture to Telstra at a formula price based on various
factors, including earnings.

In July 1994, the Company entered into a long-term joint venture agreement to
publish the official White Pages, Yellow Pages and Street Guides for Rio de
Janeiro.  The Company invested $2,517,000 to acquire a 50% interest in the
common shares together with preferred stock of Telelistas Editora Ltda., a
Brazilian company which has a contract to publish Rio's telephone directories
on behalf of TELERJ, the government-owned telephone company.  The agreement
requires the Company to invest up to an additional $5,700,000 (which, together
with the original investment, represents 75% of the agreed initial preferred
stock and debt financing by the venturers) in the joint venture in fiscal year
1995 as well as to provide technology, expertise and key personnel in directory
production, sales and marketing.

Effective February 28, 1994, the Company's 50% interest in Pacific Volt
Information Systems, a joint venture with a subsidiary of Pacific Bell
Directory, was redeemed by the venture for approximately $16,400,000.  The
venture composed telephone directories in California for Pacific Bell Directory
under a contract that was due to expire on December 31, 1996.  The sale of the
Company's interest resulted in a gain of $9,770,000 ($5,760,000, net of income
taxes, or $1.20 per share).

The following summarizes certain financial information of the joint ventures:

(a) During the first quarter of fiscal 1993, the Company's Australian corporate
joint venture changed its method of accounting for income taxes by adopting
Statement of Financial Standards No. 109, "Accounting for Income Taxes."  The
cumulative effect of the change increased the joint venture's income by
$5,688,000 due to its ability to recognize deferred Australian tax assets as
permitted by Statement No. 109.  The Company's portion of this increase in
income, net of United States taxes, is $432,000 and is included in the
Company's cumulative effect of a change in accounting for income taxes.

the Company's share of the venture's income amounted to $2,310,000 and
$3,483,000, respectively, which exceeded 12-1/2% of the venture's income by
$740,000 and $1,594,000, respectively.  The equity in the income of Australian
joint ventures for fiscal 1992 was reduced by $500,000, representing a loss of
a joint venture that ceased operations in December 1991.  Such loss included
$808,000 resulting from additional provisions for doubtful accounts, offset, in
part, by settlement of a liability.

Consolidated retained earnings at October 28, 1994 includes $4,309,000,
representing the undistributed earnings of the joint ventures.  Income taxes
have been paid or provided for on such earnings.


NOTE N--EMPLOYEE BENEFITS

The Company has a non-contributory Employee Stock Ownership Plan (ESOP) which
provides for open market or private purchases of Company common stock from time
to time, or contributions by the Company of unissued or treasury shares.
Contributions are made for all employees who have completed one year of service
for a participating employer. Vesting occurs at a rate of 25% per year of
service, commencing with the completion of three years of service.  For fiscal
1994, $250,000 was accrued and will be contributed in treasury shares in 1995.
For fiscal 1992, $175,000 was accrued and treasury shares were contributed for
payment thereof in 1993.  During fiscal 1993, there was no expense related to
the ESOP.

The Company has savings plans which permit eligible employees to make
contributions on a pretax salary reduction basis in accordance with the
provisions of Section 401(k) of the Internal Revenue Code.  The Company does
not match employees' contributions.

NOTE O--FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS

Financial instruments which potentially subject the Company to concentrations
of credit risk are primarily cash investments and accounts receivable.  At
October 28, 1994, the Company's cash investments were primarily in investment
grade, short-term instruments.  Concentrations of credit risk with respect to
the receivables are limited due to the large number of customers in the
Company's customer base, and their dispersion across different industries and
geographic areas.

The Company purchases foreign currency option contracts to hedge the adverse
impact on its foreign currency receivables and sales when the dollar
strengthens against the related foreign currencies.  Foreign exchange (gains)
losses in the accompanying statements of operations include (1) any gain on
option contracts, which are recognized in income in the same period as losses
on the hedged receivables and reduced dollar amount of sales and (2) the
premium cost of option contracts, which is amortized over the contract period.
At October 28, 1994, the Company had purchased options, all of which expire in
fiscal 1995 to exchange various European currencies for U.S. dollars, in the
aggregate amount of $3,500,000.  There were no unrealized  gains or losses on
these contract at such date.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS--Continued


NOTE O--FINANCIAL INTRUMENTS--Continued


The Company entered into an interest rate cap agreement with a bank to reduce
the impact of increases in interest rates on short-term commercial paper which
directly impacts costs connected with the sale of interests in accounts
receivable up to $25,000,000 (see Note C).  The agreement entitles the Company
to receive payments to the extent that interest rates on 30 day commercial
paper exceed 6.5% through March 1, 1996.  The $465,000 fee paid for this cap
agreement is included in other assets and is being amortized over the
three-year term.  At October 28, 1994, the amortized cost approximates the fair
value of the agreement.

Counterparties to the currency option contracts and interest-rate cap agreement
are major banks.  Credit loss from counterparty nonperformance is not
anticipated.
