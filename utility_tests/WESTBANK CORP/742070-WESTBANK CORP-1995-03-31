On the Cover:

The letter "W" on our front cover emblem was designed to depict two crossed
"V's".  They stand for "Vigilance" and "Vision".

It was our vigilance that carried us through the turbulent early 1990's
and brought us the success we enjoy today, and it is our vision that will
insure that this success continues into the 21st century.

Chairman's and President's Letter
Westbank Corporation and Subsidiaries

To Our Shareholders and Friends:

American companies are undergoing a renaissance by revising the traditional
ways of doing business.  Those with a clear vision of the future and the
capability to embrace change will successfully alter their operations and be
rewarded.  The challenge in banking is no less monumental than in other
industries.  To be successful in a rapidly changing environment requires
vigilance, vision and adherence to a long-range strategy.

Building upon success was the challenge your Management Team faced when
entering 1994.  Time is proving that our steady and consistent approach to
enhancing shareholder value is the best way to ensure continued growth for
Westbank.  It has been gratifying to reach new goals, and for 1994 we can
report achievements such as record earnings, improved net interest income,
strong and healthy loan growth, and the declaration of a quarterly cash
dividend.  We began 1994 with challenges and are now setting higher standards
and goals for 1995.

We are pleased to report that Westbank Corporation continued to build on its
solid foundation in 1994, earning a record $2,175,000, or $.68 per share, a
12% increase in earnings over the previous year.  Most recently we achieved
our thirteenth consecutive quarter of increased core earnings.

Our net income denotes a .93% return on assets and a 14.77% return on total
shareholders' equity ratios which reflect our determination to operate our
franchise more efficiently and effectively.  These ratios compare very
favorably with those of our peers.

We regret to inform you that in early 1995 an internal investigation revealed
an alleged embezzlement by a former employee which resulted in a pre-tax loss
of approximately $750,000.  No depositor's accounts were affected and the
Corporation anticipates recovery of a substantial portion of this loss from
its bonding company.  As a result of the discovery, however, the Corporation
was required to recognize this loss in its fourth quarter and year-end
financial statements for 1994.

In spite of this temporary setback we continue to commit our resources to
those lines of business where we see the opportunity for the greatest
profitable growth.  Targeted loan and demand deposit growth account for an
improved net interest margin of 5% for 1994 and an expanded 5.2% margin
during the last quarter of the year.  For the year, net interest income
improved by $774,000 or 8% compared to 1993.

During the year, net loans grew by more than $20 million or 12% over 1993 and
totaled $192.7 million at year-end 1994.  Deposits grew to $218.6 million, an
increase of $16.1 million, or 8%, over the previous year.  Demand deposits
have increased by 17% or $5.9 million.

                                       (2)




Chairman's and President's Letter
Westbank Corporation and Subsidiaries


Assets totaled $243.3 million, a 6% yearly increase and the Corporation's
capital rose to $15.3 million.

Another indicator of Westbank's renewed health in 1994 was the improvement
in our capital ratio from 5.80% in 1993 to 6.31% on December 31, 1994.  Under
the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation guidelines, Westbank's capital
ratio meets the regulatory criterion for an "adequately capitalized" bank. 
As a result of the Corporation's markedly improved financial condition, the
Formal Regulatory Order was released in 1994 and upgraded to an informal
Memorandum of Understanding.

Encouraged by our results and confident in our future, the Board of Directors
voted a cash dividend payment in the amount of $.05 per share payable on
January 25, 1995 to stockholders of record on January 20, 1995.  On February
15, 1995, the Board of Directors approved an amendment to the Corporation's
Dividend Reinvestment and Common Stock Purchase Plan (subject to shareholder
approval at the 1995 Annual Meeting of Shareholders).  We know that this
amendment will benefit the Corporation and the shareholders who choose to
participate, along with the one-third of our shareholders already enrolled in
the Plan.  Details of the amendment can be found in the Corporation's 1995
Proxy Statement.  We encourage you to vote for it.

Over the past several years, Westbank has been vigilant in monitoring the
costs associated with doing business, constantly looking for ways to reduce
expenses while improving efficiency throughout the Corporation.  The
efficiencies achieved this past year are primarily attributed to converting
our in-house data processing system to that of a service bureau.

Today's consumers are more diverse, more sophisticated and more willing to
comparison-shop for financial services.  They are also more insistent that
the companies they do business with are good corporate citizens.  They want
relationships with organizations that actively support their communities. 
That gives Westbank a competitive edge.  A constant and caring community
focus is well-ingrained in our corporate culture, built on a long-standing
presence in the communities we serve.  As a result of a compliance
examination by the Office of the Commissioner of Banks, Westbank's
subsidiary, Park West Bank and Trust Company, was assigned a Community
Reinvestment Act (CRA) rating of "outstanding record of meeting community
credit needs."

Park West Bank was recognized for its programs to monitor credit needs and
for developing and participating effectively in meeting these needs.  A CRA
marketing plan has been developed with emphasis on marketing credit services
to minority and low-and-moderate-income groups in the community using all
available media, including minority newspapers and radio stations.

Chairman's and President's Letter
Westbank Corporation and Subsidiaries


Westbank's community-banking philosophy has earned it the Citizenship Award
presented by the West Springfield St. Patrick's Parade Committee, The Harold
G. Dickey Memorial Award for Outstanding Service to the West Springfield Boys
and Girls Club, and the Greater Springfield Chamber of Commerce and Small
Business Council of Greater Springfield Small Business Recognition Award.

The banking industry continues to change and consolidate as the major
financial intermediary in the U.S. economy.  Westbank Corporation will remain
focused on its role as a community bank.  We think further consolidation of
our industry is inevitable and feel that the combination of excellent
customer service and traditional bank products will be the key for a
successful bank of the future.  Westbank is well-positioned to respond to
the changing needs of our customers.

Innovative and aggressive banking strategies constitute one part of our
focus on building shareholder value.  The other part is the addition of
market share and product capability by establishing new branch offices.

Our eighth branch office, located in the center of East Longmeadow, opened
August 29, 1994.  In the first six months we have exceeded our projected
goals for the first year of operation.  We will continue to seek new
locations for branch offices that can add to our base of low-cost core
deposits and expand our banking activities in areas of Western Massachusetts
that are either fast-growing or where we are now under-represented.

We spent 1994 solidifying the gains of our turnaround and refocusing our
energies from managing risk to growing revenue by increasing our
responsiveness to customers' needs.

Today, we have the financial strength, organizational structure, corporate
culture, and a management team capable of not only responding to emerging
challenges, but truly capitalizing on the opportunities they present.

In short, we are well-prepared to win in the complex financial-services
marketplace of the '90s and beyond, and we fully expect to.

We cannot recount the successes of the past three years without extending
special acknowledgement to our dedicated Directors and Employees who have
been at the heart of our dramatic revitalization and are now paving the way
for continued improved results in 1995 and beyond.  We thank them for their
diligence and we thank you, our shareholders, for your loyal support.

Sincerely,

Alfred C. Whitaker           Donald R. Chase
Chairman of the Board        President and Chief Executive Officer

                                       (4)




Business
Westbank Corporation and Subsidiaries


Corporate Organization

Westbank Corporation (hereinafter sometimes referred to as "Westbank" or the
"Corporation") is a registered Bank Holding Company organized to facilitate
the expansion and diversification of the business of Park West Bank and Trust
Company (hereinafter sometimes referred to as "Park West" or the "Bank") into
additional financial services related to banking which are permitted by the
Federal Bank Holding Company Act of 1956, as amended.  Westbank became the
owner of all of Park West's outstanding capital stock effective July 2, 1984.

Park West Bank and Trust Company

Substantially all operating income and net income of the Corporation are
presently accounted for by Park West.

Park West is chartered as a state bank and trust company by the Commonwealth
of Massachusetts, is a member of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation
("FDIC"), and is subject to regulation by the Massachusetts Commissioner of
Banks and the FDIC.  A full range of retail banking services is furnished to
individuals, businesses, and nonprofit organizations through eight banking
offices located in Hampden County.  Such services include a wide range of
checking and savings accounts, loans, safe deposit facilities, and automated
teller machines at selected branch locations.

Park West also provides lending, depository and related financial services to
commercial, industrial, financial, and governmental customers.  In the
lending area, these include short and long term loans and revolving credit
arrangements, letters of credit, inventory and accounts receivable
financing, real estate construction lending, and mortgage loans.

Park West also operates a Trust Department providing services normally
associated with holding property in a fiduciary or agency capacity.  The
value of the property held by the Trust Department at December 31, 1994,
amounted to $84,031,000.  This amount, comprising part of the property, other
than cash deposits, is not included in the accompanying financial statements
since such items are not assets of the Bank.

Employees

As of December 31, 1994, the Corporation and its subsidiaries had an
equivalent of 111 full time officers and staff.

Competition

Westbank's banking, real estate activity and trust services are competitive
with other Massachusetts financial institutions.  Its service area is in
Western Massachusetts, primarily Hampden County.  Westbank's competitors
include other commercial banks, mutual savings banks, savings and loan
associations, credit unions, consumer finance companies, loan offices,
money market funds, and other financing organizations.

Competition for trust services by major commercial banks is high, with
continuing efforts by those banks to solicit new business.  The Trust
Department prides itself as one of the remaining corporate fiduciaries
providing personal services locally.  Insurance companies, mutual savings
banks, investment counseling firms, and other business firms and individuals
also offer active competition for such business.

Management's Discussion and Analysis - Financial Results
Westbank Corporation and Subsidiaries


Management's discussion of operations and financial position is based on the
selected consolidated financial data and should be read in conjunction with
the consolidated financial statements and notes thereto.

For 1994, the Corporation reported net income of $2,175,000 or $.68 per share
after providing $1,473,000 for loan losses and writing down other real estate
owned (OREO) by $760,000, mainly in response to further declines in the real
estate industry and the New England economy.  This compares to net income for
1993 of $1,947,000, or $.61 per share.  The Corporation's 1993 earnings
reflect a provision for loan losses of $790,000 and a write-down of OREO of
$1,164,000.  Net interest income increased $774,000 from 1993 to 1994 because
of increased interest and dividend income and decreased interest expense.

Non-interest expense, excluding the write-down of OREO related operating
expenses and an unusual expense of $750,000, amounted to $8,102,000 in 1994
compared to $8,275,000 in 1993, a decrease of $173,000, or 2%.
During March 1995 the Corporation discovered an alleged employee defalcation
of approximately $750,000.  As a result of this unfortunate act other
non-interest expense includes the writedown of the full amount of the unusual
expense.  The Corporation will be filing an insurance claim for the recovery
of a substantial portion of this loss.  We anticipate recovery will be
realized during 1995.

Non-interest income decreased by $402,000 from 1993 and reflects decreases in
gains recognized upon sale of securities totaling $194,000, a reduction of
gains on sale of mortgages totaling $110,000, and a reduction in service
charges on deposit accounts totaling $161,000.  The remaining non-interest
income reflects general increases in service fees and Trust Department fees.

Included in the 1994 results of operations is a tax benefit totaling
$430,000.  The benefit is primarily attributable to the utilization of net
operating loss carryforwards of $237,000 and a decrease in the valuation
allowance for deferred tax assets due to a change in judgement about the
realizability of such deferred tax assets. 

The 1993 results reflect the cumulative effect of an accounting change for
income taxes of $400,000 and the benefit of a change in the valuation
allowance for deferred tax assets of $558,000.

At December 31, 1994, the Corporation's total assets were $243,313,000, an
increase of $14,450,000, or 6.3%, from $228,863,000 at year end 1993.  The
higher level of assets resulted primarily through an increase in net loans
totaling $20,059,000.

Non-performing assets amounted to $7,435,000, or 3.06% of total assets at
December 31, 1994, compared with $7,042,000 or 3.08% at the end of 1993.

Since March, 1992, Park West has been operating under a Formal Order (the
"Formal Order") with the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation and the
Commissioner of Banks for the Commonwealth of Massachusetts.  On December 22,
1994, as a result of the improved financial condition of the Bank, the Formal
Order was released.  The Formal Order was replaced with a Memorandum of
Understanding (the "Memorandum").  The Memorandum is an informal agreement
with the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (the "FDIC") and the
Commissioner of Banks for the Commonwealth of Massachusetts (the
"Commissioner") requiring Park West, among other things, to maintain a
leverage capital ratio of at least 6%, to develop a written plan of action to
lessen its risk exposure to certain borrowers and to refrain from extending
or renewing credit to any borrower who has a loan or extension of credit with
Park West that has been charged off or classified, without first obtaining
majority approval of Park West's Board of Directors.  Park West must maintain
the allowance for loan losses at a level commensurate to the risk in the loan
portfolio.  The Memorandum requires Park West to obtain approval from the
FDIC and the Commissioner prior to paying or declaring a dividend.  Finally,
Park West is required to make quarterly reports to the FDIC and the
Commissioner detailing the form and manner of action taken to secure
compliance with the Memorandum.

The Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation Improvement Act of 1991 ("FDICIA")
imposes significant regulatory restrictions and requirements on banking
institutions insured by the FDIC and their holding companies. 
FDICIA established capital categories into which financial institutions are
placed based on capital level.  Each capital category establishes different
degrees of regulatory restrictions which can apply to a financial
institution.  As of December 31, 1994, Park West's capital was at a level that
 placed the Bank in the adequately capitalized category as defined by FDICIA.

FDICIA imposes a variety of other restrictions and requirements on insured
banks.  These include significant regulatory reporting requirements such as
insuring that a system of risk-based deposit insurance premiums and civil
money penalties for inaccurate deposit assessment reports exist. 
In addition, FDICIA imposes a system of regulatory standards for bank and
bank holding company operations, detailed new truth in savings disclosure
requirements, and restrictions on activities authorized by state law but not
authorized for national banks.

The weak economy and real estate market continue to impair the financial
results of the Corporation.  Despite these weaknesses the Corporation has
managed significant improvements in earnings and asset quality.  As a result
of the continued aggressive management of problem loans and an on-going
expense reduction program, the board of directors and management believe the
Corporation is positioned to comply with the Memorandum as well as the
requirements of FDICIA.

Components of Capital

The following table presents the Corporation's components of Tier 1 leverage
capital as of December 31.  The table also presents the ratio of Tier 1
capital to total assets.

Regulatory risk-based capital requirements take into account the different
risk categories of banking organizations by assigning risk weights to assets
and the credit equivalent amounts of off-balance sheet exposures.  In
addition, capital is divided into two tiers.  In this Corporation, Tier 1
includes the common stockholders' equity; Tier 2, or supplementary capital,
includes not only the equity, but also a portion of the allowance for loan
losses.

The following are the Corporation's risk-based capital ratios at December 31,
1994:

Tier 1 risk-based capital (minimum required 4%)             8.54%
Total risk-based capital (minimum required 8%)              9.80%


Asset/Liability Management and Interest Rate Sensitivity
<TABLE>
The following table sets forth the distribution of the repricing of
Westbank's earning assets and interest bearing liabilities as of December 31,
1994, the interest rate sensitivity gap, (i.e., interest rate sensitive
assets less interest rate sensitive liabilities), the cumulative interest
rate sensitivity gap, the interest rate sensitivity gap ratio and the
cumulative interest rate sensitivity gap ratio.  The table also sets forth
the time periods in which earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities
will mature or may reprice in accordance with their contractual terms. 
However, the table does not necessarily indicate the impact of general
interest rate movements on the net interest margin since the repricing of
various categories of assets and liabilities is subject to competitive
pressures and the needs of Westbank's customers.  In addition, various assets
and liabilities indicated as repricing within the same period may in fact
reprice at different times within such period and at different rates.

</TABLE>
Westbank seeks to manage the mix of asset and liability maturities to control
the effect of changes in the general level of interest rates on net interest
income.  In periods of rising interest rates, Westbank's negative interest
rate sensitivity gap as to earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities
maturing in less than one year may cause a diminution of Westbank's income;
correspondingly, in periods of declining interest rates, a negative interest
rate sensitivity gap may provide additional income.  Except for its effect on
the general level of interest rates, inflation does not have a material
impact on Westbank's earnings due to the rate of variability and short-term
maturities of its earning assets.

(a)  Interest income on non-taxable investment securities and loans
     includes the effects of tax equivalent adjustments using the marginal
     federal tax rate of 34% in adjusting tax exempt interest income to a
     fully taxable basis. 

(b)  Average loan balances above include non-accrual loans.  When a
     loan is placed in non-accrual status, interest income is recorded only
     to the extent actually received in cash.

During 1994, the yield spread increased to 4.46% from 4.43% in 1993, up 3
basis points.  The Corporation's net interest margin increased during 1994 to
5.01% from 4.85% in 1993, an increase of 16 basis points.

*The dollar amount of changes in interest income and interest expense
  attributable to changes in rate/volume has been allocated between rate and
  volume based on changes in rates times the prior year's volume and the
  changes in volume times the prior year's rate.

Net interest income on a taxable equivalent basis for 1994 increased to
$10,870,000, up 7.7% from $10,096,000 in 1993.  A 4.2% increase in average
earning assets and a 21 basis point reduction in average rate of return
resulted in an increase in volume of $836,000 and a reduction in rate of
$599,000.  A reduction of 1.5% in average interest bearing liabilities and a
24 basis point reduction in average rate of interest paid contributed to a
reduction in volume and rate of $30,000 and $507,000, respectively.

Liquidity

Liquidity management requires close scrutiny of the mix and maturity of
deposits and borrowings and short-term investments.  Cash and due from banks,
federal funds sold, investment securities and mortgage-backed securities, as
compared to deposits, are used by Westbank to compute its liquidity on a
daily basis as adjusted for regulatory purposes.  At December 31, 1994,
Westbank's ratio of such assets to total deposits was 25.6%.  In addition,
Westbank is subject to Regulation D of the Federal Reserve Bank (FRB), which
requires depository institutions to maintain reserve balances on deposit with
the FRB based on certain average depositor balances.  Westbank is in
compliance with Regulation D.  Management of Westbank believes that its
current liquidity is sufficient to meet current and anticipated funding
needs.

     amortization of premiums, by the book value of securities outstanding.

Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 115 "Accounting for Certain
Investment in Debt and Equity Securities" ("SFAS No. 115") was issued by the
Financial Accounting Standards Board.  SFAS No. 115 required specific
accounting and reporting treatment in certain equity securities and all debt
securities.  These investments are required to be classified in three
categories and accounted for as follows:

  Held to Maturity - Reported at amortized cost.
  Available for Sale - Reported at fair value, with unrealized
  gains/losses, net of income taxes excluded from earnings and
  reported as a separate component of shareholders' equity.
  Trading Securities - Reported at fair value with unrealized
  gains/losses included in earnings.

The Corporation implemented SFAS No. 115 effective January 1, 1994 and the
effect of implementing was an increase of the Corporation's capital of
$233,000.

Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 114, "Accounting by Creditors
for Impairment of a Loan" ("SFAS No. 114") addresses the accounting by
creditors for impairment of certain loans.  It is applicable to all creditors
and to all loans, uncollateralized as well as collateralized, except large
groups of smaller balance homogeneous loans that are collectively
evaluated for impairment, loans that are measured at fair value or at the
lower of cost or fair value, leases, and debt securities as defined in SFAS
No. 115.  It applies to all loans that are restructured in a troubled debt,
the restructuring involving a modification of terms.

SFAS No. 114 requires that impaired loans that are within the scope of the
Statement be measured based on the present value of expected future cash
flows discounted at the loan's effective interest rate or, as a practical
expedient, at the loan's observable market price or the fair value of the
collateral if the loan is collateral dependent.

The Statement is required to be adopted by the Corporation on January 1,
1995.  No significant impact from the adoption of this statement is expected
on the Bank's financial condition or results of operations.

Management's Discussion and Analysis - Financial Results (Continued)
Westbank Corporation and Subsidiaries


Loan Loss Experience

The provision for loan losses is an amount added to the allowance against
which loan losses are charged.  The provision for losses is dependent on
actual net write-offs and an evaluation as to the collectibility of the loan
portfolio taking into consideration such factors as the financial condition
of individual borrowers, historical loss experience with respect to various
portfolio segments, current and near term economic conditions, and the size
of the portfolio.  Based on these reviews, the allowance for loan losses at
December 31, 1994, is deemed to be adequate by management.  In the
determination of the allowance for loan losses management obtains independent
appraisals for a significant number of properties.  Management has also
retained an independent loan review consultant to provide advice on the
adquacy of the loan loss allowance.

The following table sets forth the historical relationship among the average
amount of loans outstanding, the allowance for loan losses, provision for
loan losses charged to operating expenses, losses charged off, recoveries and

================================================================================

The approach the Corporation uses in determining the adequacy of the
allowance for loan losses is the combination of a target reserve and general
reserve allocation.  Quarterly, based on an internal review of the loan
portfolio, the Corporation identifies required reserve allocations targeted
to recognized problem loans that, in the opinion of management, have
potential loss exposure or questions relative to the adequacy of the
collateral on these same loans.  In addition, the Corporation allocates a
general reserve against the remainder of the loan portfolio.

Non-Performing Assets

Loans
<TABLE>
Loans on which interest and principal payments are 90 days or more past due
are placed on a non-accrual basis (earlier if deemed appropriate) and
interest is reversed unless management determines that the collectibility of
principal and interest is not reasonably considered in  doubt.  The following
table sets forth information with regard to non-performing loans as of the
end of each year indicated:

=================================================================================================================================
</TABLE>
The gross amount of interest that would have been accrued at the original
contract rate on loans on a  non-accrual basis (in thousands) was $342, $126,
$124, $346, and $239 for 1994, 1993, 1992, 1991, and 1990, respectively.  The
only income included in the results of operations is (in thousands) $20 of
interest income relating to these loans for 1994.

During the second and third quarters of 1994, management moved four loans
totaling approximately $4,000,000 to non-performing status.  These four loans
were not newly identified loan problems, as each loan has been listed on the
Banks internal watch and classified loan list for a substantial period of
time.  The classification to non-performing status is in response to further
deterioration of these four borrowers and managements' aggressive action in
an attempt to resolve them.  Each of the loans is real estate related.

Restructured Loans
<TABLE>
A restructured loan is one for which the Corporation has modified the
contractual terms to provide a reduction in the rate of interest and, in most
instances, an extension of payments of principal or interest or both because
of a deterioration in the financial position of the borrower.  Restructured
loans which are performing in accordance with their new terms are not
included in non-accrual loans unless concern exists as to the ultimate
collection of principal or interest.  Restructured loans, which are
classified as accruing loans, amounted to $501,000 at December 31, 1994,
compared to $494,000 in 1993.  The average current yield on these loans was
approximately 8.4%.  The following is an analysis of interest income related
to restructured loans which are classified as accruing loans:

Comparison of 1994 with 1993

Interest Income

Westbank's earning assets include a diverse portfolio of interest earning
instruments ranging from Westbank's core business of loan extensions to
interest-bearing securities issued by federal, state and municipal
authorities.  These earning assets are financed through a combination of
interest-bearing and interest-free sources.

Total interest income for 1994 amounted to $17,046,000 as compared to
$16,809,000 for 1993, an increase of $237,000, or 1.41% which is a result of
an increase in average earning assets of $8,662,000 or 4.2% combined with a
21 basis point reduction in the average earning interest rate.

Interest Expense

Interest expense for 1994 on deposits and borrowings amounted to $6,199,000
as compared to $6,736,000 in 1993, a decrease of $537,000 or 7.97%.  A
decrease in the average interest bearing liabilities of $2,717,000, as well
as, a decrease in the average rate of interest paid in 1994 of 24 basis
points compared to 1993, contributed to the overall interest expense
reduction.

Net Interest Income

Net interest income, the most significant component of earnings, is the
amount by which the interest generated by assets exceeds the interest expense
on liabilities.  For analytical purposes, the interest earned on tax exempt
assets is adjusted to a "tax equivalent basis" using statutory rates to
recognize the income tax savings which facilitates comparison between taxable
and tax exempt assets.

Westbank's management attempts to analyze its performance by utilizing the
concepts of interest rate spread and net yield on earning assets.  The
interest rate spread represents the difference between the yield on earning
assets and interest paid on interest-bearing liabilities.  The net yield on
earning assets is the difference between the rate of interest on earning
assets and the effective rate paid on all funds, interest-bearing
liabilities, as well as interest-free sources (primarily demand deposits and
stockholders' equity).

Provision for Loan Losses

The 1994 provision for loan losses totalled $1,473,000 compared with $790,000
in 1993, an increase of 86%.  A full discussion appears previously under the
heading of LOAN LOSS EXPERIENCE.

Non-Interest Income

Income from sources other than interest was $2,459,000 in 1994, a decrease of
$402,000 from the prior year.  During 1994, service fees and Trust Department
fees remained level when compared to 1993, while income from gain on sale of
securities, mortgages and service charges on deposit accounts were
responsible for the overall decline in non-interest income.

===========================================================================================
</TABLE>
Overall non-interest expense increased by $16,000 compared to 1993.

Other real estate owned expenses declined by $561,000 compared to 1993, the
result of less real estate under management by the Bank during the current
year.  Salaries and benefits as well as occupancy expense increased by
$334,000, the impact of a new branch office opened during 1994.  Other
non-interest expense increased by $243,000.  During March 1995 the bank
discovered an alleged employee defalcation which caused the Corporation to
charge $750,000 to other non-interest expense during 1994.  The remaining
other non-interest expense declined by more than $500,000, the result of
continued cost reduction measures, including the savings generated from
the Bank's conversion to a data processing service bureau versus an in
house system.

Income Taxes

The Financial Accounting Standards Board issued a Statement of Financial
Accounting Standard No. 109, "Accounting for Income Taxes" ("SFAS No. 109")
in February, 1992.  The Statement requires the recognition of deferred tax
assets, net of applicable reserves, related to net operating loss
carryforwards and certain temporary differences.  Effective January 1, 1993,
the Corporation prospectively adopted SFAS No. 109, resulting in a $400,000
benefit which has been reported as a cumulative effect of the change in
accounting principle.

For the year ended December 31, 1994 Westbank recorded a tax benefit of
$430,000, which is primarily the result of the utilization of net operating
loss carryforwards of $237,000 and a decrease in a valuation allowance of
$771,000 pertaining to deferred tax assets offset by the provision for
current taxes.  The decrease in such valuation reserve is due to the
continued profitable performance of the Bank and the resultant consideration
of the realizability of deferred tax assets.

Net Income

The net income for 1994 of $2,175,000, or $.68 per share, is based on a
weighted average of 3,203,985 shares outstanding, compared with a net income
for 1993 of $1,947,000, or $.61 based on a weighted average of 3,190,486
shares outstanding.

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements
Westbank Corporation and Subsidiaries


1 - Summary of Significant Accounting Policies

The accounting and reporting policies of Westbank Corporation (the
"Corporation") and its subsidiaries are in conformity with generally accepted
accounting principles and general practices within the banking industry.  The
following is a description of the more significant policies.


Basis of Presentation and Consolidation

The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Corporation
and its wholly-owned subsidiary, Park West Bank and Trust Company ("Park
West"), its subsidiaries, Lorac Leasing Corp., and PWB&T Inc.  All material
intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated upon
consolidation.  Certain amounts in the 1993 and 1992 financial statements
have been reclassified to conform to the 1994 presentation.

The financial statements have been prepared in conformity with generally
accepted accounting principles.  In preparing the financial statements,
management is required to make estimates and assumptions that affect the
reported amounts of assets and liabilities as of the date of the balance
sheet and revenues and expenses for the period.  Actual results could differ
significantly from those estimates.

Material estimates that are particularly susceptible to significant change
relate to the determination of the allowance for loan losses and the
valuation of real estate acquired in connection with foreclosures or in
satisfaction of loans.  In connection with the determination of the
allowances for loan losses and other real estate owned, management obtains
independent appraisals for significant properties.

In addition, various regulatory agencies, as an integral part of their
examination process, periodically review the Bank's allowances for losses on
loans and other real estate owned.  Such agencies may require the Bank to
recognize additions to the allowances based on their judgments about
information available to them at the time of their examination.


Cash and Cash Equivalents

The Corporation defines cash and due from banks,interest-bearing deposits
and federal funds sold to be cash equivalents.


Securities

Securities that management has the positive intent and ability to hold until
maturity are stated at cost, adjusted for amortization of premiums and
accretion of discounts.  Those securities which have been identified as
assets for which there is not a positive intent to hold to maturity,
including all marketable equity securities, are classified as available for
sale.  The Corporation classifies all securities with a maturity of less than
three years as available for sale.  In addition, any mortgage-backed
securities created out of the Banks own inventory of residential real estate
loans are also considered available for sale.  All other securities are
classified as held to maturity.  Gains and losses on sales of securities are
recognized at the time of sale on a specific identification basis.

Mortgage-backed securities held to maturity are stated at cost, adjusted for
amortization of premiums and accretion of discounts determined by a method
that does not materially differ from the level-yield method.  Management has
the positive ability and the intent to hold these assets until maturity.

Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 115, "Accounting for Certain
Investment in Debt and Equity Securities" ("SFAS No. 115") addresses the
accounting and reporting for investments in equity securities that have
readily determinable fair values and for all investments in debt securities. 
Those investments are to be classified in three categories and accounted for
as follows:

Held to Maturity Securities - reported at amortized cost.

Trading Securities - reported at fair value with unrealized gains/losses
included in earnings.

Available for Sale - reported at fair value, with unrealized gains/losses,
net of income taxes, excluded from earnings and reported as a separate
component of shareholders' equity.

Effective January 1, 1994, the Corporation adopted SFAS No. 115 resulting in
an increase of $233,000 to stockholders' equity representing the net
unrealized gain on investment securities available for sale, net of related
income taxes.  At the time the Corporation adopted SFAS No. 115, investment
securities with a book value of $14,947,000 and market value of $15,350,000
were reclassified as available for sale.

                                       (24)

Loans

Loans have been reduced by unadvanced loan funds, deferred loan fees, and the
allowance for loan losses.

Interest on commercial and real estate loans is accrued on the principal
amount of loans outstanding.  Interest on discounted installment loans is
recognized by a method which approximates the interest method.  Interest on
other loans, is calculated by using the simple interest method on daily
balances of the principal amount
outstanding.

Non-accrual loans are loans on which the accrual of interest ceases when the
collection of principal or interest payments is determined to be doubtful by
management.  It is the general policy of the Corporation to discontinue the
accrual of interest when principal or interest payments are delinquent 90
days or more unless the loan principal and interest are determined by
management to be fully collectible (or sooner if conditions warrant).  Any
unpaid amounts previously accrued on these loans are reversed from income,
and thereafter interest is recognized only to the extent payments are
received and any doubt concerning collectibility has been removed.

The adequacy of the allowance for loan losses is evaluated regularly by
management.  Factors considered in evaluating the adequacy of the allowance
include the size of the portfolio, previous loss experience, current economic
conditions and their effect on borrowers and the financial condition of
individual borrowers and the related performance of individual loans in
relation to contract terms.  The provision for loan losses charged to
operating expense is based upon management's judgment of the amount necessary
to maintain the allowance at a level adequate to absorb losses.  Loan losses
are charged against the allowance for loan losses when management believes
the collectibility of the principal is unlikely.

Loan origination fees, net of certain direct loan origination costs, are
deferred and recognized as income over the life of the related loan as an
adjustment to the loan's yield.

Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 114, "Accounting by Creditors
for Impairment of a Loan" ("SFAS No. 114") was issued by the Financial
Accounting Standards Board.  This Statement addresses the accounting by
creditors for impairment of certain loans.  It is applicable to all creditors
and to all loans, uncollateralized as well as collateralized except large
groups of smaller balance homogeneous loans that are collectively evaluated
for impairment, loans that are measured at fair value or at the lower of cost
or fair value, leases, and debt securities.  It applies to all loans that are
restructured in a troubled debt restructuring involving a modification of
terms.  SFAS No. 114 requires that impaired loans that are within the scope
of the Statement be measured based on the present value of expected future
cash flows discounted at the loan's effective interest rate or, as a
practical expedient, at the loan's observable market price or the fair value
of the collateral if the loan is collateral dependent.

This Statement applies to the Corporation's financial
statements as of January 1, 1995.  Management believes that it is currently
substantially in compliance with SFAS No. 114 and no significant impact from
adoption is expected on the Bank's financial condition or results of
its operations.


Property and Equipment

Property and equipment are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation and
amortization.  Depreciation is computed using the straight-line method for
book purposes.  Amortization of leasehold improvements is charged over the
terms of the respective leases, including option periods or the estimated
useful lives of the improvements, whichever is shorter.  Gains and losses are
recognized upon disposal of assets.  The cost of maintenance and repairs is
charged to income as incurred, whereas significant renewals are capitalized.


Other Real Estate Owned and In-substance Foreclosures

Other real estate owned ("OREO") includes properties the Bank has acquired
through foreclosure and properties deemed to be foreclosed in substance. 
OREO is recorded at the lower of cost or fair value at the date of
acquisition, less estimated selling costs.  At the time of foreclosure, the
excess, if any, of the loan amount over the fair value of the asset acquired
is charged off against the allowance for loan losses.  Operating expenses to
administer OREO properties are charged directly to operating expenses. 
Valuation allowances are established subsequent to acquisition, as necessary,
based upon management's continuing assessment of the fair values of the
properties.  Non-performing loans are considered "in-substance foreclosures"
when the borrower is deemed to have little or no equity in the collateral, is
not expected to rebuild such equity in the foreseeable future and proceeds
for repayment of the loan are expected to come only from the operation or
sale of the collateral.  Loans meeting this criteria are carried at the lower
of the loan amount or collateral fair value, less estimated selling costs.

                                       (25)

Deferred Premium on Loans Sold

The Corporation sells mortgage loans resulting in gains or losses which are
deferred at the time of the sale when the average interest rate on the loans
sold, after normal servicing fees, differs from the agreed yield to the
buyer.  The premium or discount which results from these sales is amortized
using the interest method over the estimated remaining life of the loans,
adjusted for estimated prepayments.  Such amortization is charged against
operations based upon amounts considered necessary by management to reflect
accelerated prepayment experience.


Income Taxes

Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 109, "Accounting for Income
Taxes" ("SFAS No. 109") established the asset and liability method of
accounting for income taxes.  Under SFAS No. 109, deferred tax assets and
liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to
differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing
assets and liabilities and their respective tax basis.  To the extent that
current available evidence about the future raises doubt about the
realization of a deferred tax asset, a valuation allowance must be
established.  Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted
tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those
temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled.  Under SFAS
No. 109, the effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax
rates is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date.
The Corporation adopted SFAS No. 109 on January 1, 1993, and reported the
cumulative effect of that change in the statement of income for the year
ended December 31, 1993.

Pursuant to the deferred method under Accounting Principles Board Opinion 11
("APB 11"), which was applied in 1992, deferred income taxes are recognized
for income and expense items that are reported in different years for
financial reporting purposes and income tax purposes using the tax rate
applicable for the year of the calculation.  Under APB 11, deferred taxes
were not adjusted for subsequent changes in tax rates.


Pension Plan

The Corporation has a trusteed contributory defined contribution pension plan
covering substantially all employees.  The Corporation's policy is to fund
accrued pension cost.


Trust Department

Assets held by the Corporation for customers in a fiduciary or agency
capacity are not included in the consolidated financial statements, as such
items are not assets of the Corporation.  Such assets totaled approximately
$84,031,000 and $84,600,000 at December 31, 1994 and 1993, respectively. 
Trust income is recognized on a cash basis.  The amounts recognized under
this method are not materially different from amounts that would be
recognized on the accrual basis.


Net Earnings Per Share

The computation of earnings per share is based on the weighted average number
of shares of common stock and common stock equivalents outstanding during the
year.


2 - Securities

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued)
Westbank Corporation and Subsidiaries


The Corporation did not sell any loans with recourse during 1994.  The
remaining recourse exposure on prior sales was $5,685,000 at December 31,
1994.  Management does not believe that its recourse obligations subject the
Corporation to any material risk of loss in the future.  The Corporation has
suffered no losses as a result of these recourse obligations.

Of the $152,194,000 in real estate loans at December 31, 1994, $81,333,000
are collateralized by 1-4 family dwellings originated with an 80% or less
loan-to-value ratio.  The majority of the collateral for these loans is
located in the bank's direct market area of Western Massachusetts. 
Commercial real estate and real estate construction loans represented
$66,827,000 in outstanding principal at December 31, 1994.  These loans
encompass a wider region extending throughout Massachusetts and Southern New
England.  Most are collateralized by commercial real estate developments. 
Commercial loans both collateralized and uncollateralized of $34,306,000 at
December 31, 1994 represent loans made to businesses in Western
Massachusetts.

The Bank has had, and expects to have in the future, banking transactions in
the ordinary course of business with its directors and officers.  Such loans,
in the opinion of management, do not include more than the risk of normal
collectibility nor other unfavorable features.

The following summarizes the activity with respect to indebtedness, both
direct and indirect, with an aggregate of $60,000 or more for the directors,
policy-making officers and major stockholders during the years ended December

==============================================================================

The net change in the total valuation allowance for the year ended December
31, 1994 was a decrease of $1,093,000.  In assessing the realizability of
deferred tax assets, management considers whether it is more likely than not
that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. 
The ultimate realization of deferred tax assets is dependent upon the
generation of future taxable income during the periods in which those
temporary differences become deductible.  Management considers the scheduled
reversal of deferred tax assets and liabilities, projected future taxable
income, and tax planning strategies in making this assessment.  Based upon
the level of historical taxable income and projections for future taxable
income over the periods which the deferred tax assets are deductible,
management believes it is more likely than not the Corporation will realize
the benefits of these deductible differences, net of the existing valuation
allowances at December 31, 1994. 

Deferred tax expense results from timing differences in the recognition of
revenue and expense for tax and financial statement purposes.  The primary
sources and the tax effect of these differences for December 31 are as
follows:

approximately $318,000 which may be carried over indefinitely.

Park West Bank and Trust Company, a wholly-owned subsidiary of the
Corporation, has a contributory defined contribution pension plan (money
purchase), covering substantially all of its employees.  Contributions to the
pension plan are a percentage of individual employees' salary.  Total pension
expense for 1994, 1993 and 1992 amounted to $216,000, $198,000 and $216,000,
respectively.  At May 31, 1994, the most recent plan year, total plan assets
were $1,774,000 and the vested balance was $1,696,000.

11 - Stock Options

The Corporation offers shares of common stock to officers and key employees
pursuant to the 1985 Incentive Stock Option Plan.  On April 16, 1992, all
outstanding options were canceled and 67,913 options at a price of $2 per
share were issued.  As of December 31, 1994, all options granted are
exercisable.  At the 1994 Annual Meeting of Shareholders the 1985 Incentive
Stock Option Plan was amended to increase the number of shares reserved for
issuance by 200,000 shares.  The following is a summary of the changes in
options outstanding:

Rent expense for 1994, 1993 and 1992 amounted to $109,000, $113,000 and
$95,000, respectively.

13 - Commitments, Contingent Liabilities
     and Financial Instruments with
     Off-Balance-Sheet Risk

In the normal course of business, various commitments and contingent
liabilities are outstanding, such as guarantees, standby
letters of credit, commitments to extend credit and various financial
instruments with off-balance-sheet risk that are not reflected in the
financial statements.  Financial instruments with off-balance-sheet risk
involve elements of credit risk, interest rate risk, liquidity risk and
market risk.  Management does not anticipate any significant losses as a
result of these transactions.

The following table summarizes the contractual value of financial instruments
and other commitments and contingent liabilities at December 31:

(Dollars in Thousands)                                   1994            1993
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Commitments to grant loans                             $6,116         $10,314
Performance letters of
  credit and financial guarantees                         892           1,091
Commitments to advance funds
  under existing loan agreements                       34,127          32,411
Commitments for the sale and
  delivery of mortgage loans to FMNA                       --           3,219

The Bank uses the same credit policies in making commitment and conditional
obligations as it does for on-balance-sheet instruments.

Commitments to extend credit are agreements to lend to a customer as long as
there is no violation of any condition established in the contract. 
Commitments generally have fixed expiration dates or other termination
clauses and may require payment of a fee.  Since commitments may be expected
to expire without being drawn upon, the total commitment amounts do not
necessarily represent future cash requirements.  The Bank evaluates each
customer's creditworthiness on a case-by-case basis.  The amount of collateral
obtained, if deemed necessary by the Bank upon extension of credit, is based
on management's credit evaluation of the borrower.  Collateral held varies
but may include accounts receivable, inventory, property plant and equipment
and income-producing commercial properties.

Certain litigation is pending against the Corporation.  Management, after
consultation with legal counsel, does not anticipate that any ultimate
liability arising out of such litigation will have a material effect on the
Corporation's financial statements.

14 - Other Non-Interest Income and Expense

The components of other non-interest income and expense, which are in excess
of 1% of the aggregate of total interest income and non-interest income and
not shown separately on the consolidated statements of income, are as
follows:

  Unusual item                            750              --              --

During March 1995 the bank discovered an alleged employee defalcation of
approximately $750,000.  Included in the financial statements for 1994 is the
writedown of this unusual item (shown above).

15 - Stockholders' Equity and
     Regulatory Matters

As a federally insured banking institution, Park West Bank and Trust Company
("Park West") is subject to regulation by the Federal Deposit Insurance
Corporation (the "FDIC").  In February 1992, Park West's Board of Directors
agreed to enter into a Stipulation and Consent (the "Consent Agreement") with
the FDIC and the Commissioner of Banks for the Commonwealth of Massachusetts
(the "Commissioner").  The Consent Agreement provided for a cease and desist
order (the "Order") issued by the FDIC, which required Park West to take
certain affirmative actions in response to an examination by the FDIC and the
Commissioner. 

On December 22, 1994, in conjunction with an examination by the Commissioner
the Order was eliminated and replaced with a Memorandum of Understanding (the
"Memorandum").  The Memorandum requires, among other items: Park West's Tier
1 capital to total asset ratio remain at or above 6%; Park West to submit
written plans to further reduce classified assets; the Bank to review and/or
revise its Asset/Liability Management Policy; and not declare or pay any
dividends without prior approval by the FDIC and the Commissioner.  Park West
management believes that the Bank will be able to comply with all of the
terms of the Memorandum.

The Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation Improvement Act of 1991 ("FDICIA")
includes significant changes to the legal and regulatory environment for
insured depository institutions, including reductions in insurance coverage
for certain kinds of deposits, increased supervision by the federal
regulatory agencies, increased reporting requirements for insured
institutions, and new regulations concerning internal controls, accounting,
and operations.

Under the prompt corrective action provisions of FDICIA, specific capital
categories were defined based on an institution's capital ratios.  To be
considered "adequately capitalized" an institution must generally have a
leverage ratio of at least 4%, a Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio of at least
4%, and a total risk-based capital ratio of at least 8%.

At December 31, 1994, the Bank's leverage ratio was 6.36%, Tier 1 risk-based
ratio was 8.52% and total risk-based ratio was 9.77%, based on leverage
capital of $15,288,000, Tier 1 capital of $15,288,000, and total risk-based
capital of $17,709,000, as defined.  At Dec-ember 31, 1994, the institution
is classified as "adequately capitalized" as defined under FDICIA as
described above.

Westbank Corporation has adopted a Shareholders Rights Plan.  The plan
provides for the distribution of one Common Stock Purchase Right for each
outstanding share of Common Stock of the Corporation to stockholders of
record at the close of business on January 2, 1990.  Each Right entitles
the registered holder to purchase from the Corporation one share of Common
Stock, par value $2 per share (the "Common Stock"), at a cash Exercise Price
of $36 per share of Common Stock, subject to adjustment.

The Purchase Rights will be exercisable for shares of common stock having a
market value of two times the exercise price in the event that the Board of
Directors determines that the Corporation may be the subject of an adverse
takeover.  In the event that the Corporation is acquired in a merger in which
the Corporation is not the surviving corporation or 50 percent or more of the
Corporation's assets or earning power is sold, the Purchase Rights will be
exercisable for common stock of the acquiring corporation having a market
value of two times the exercise price.  The Purchase Rights may be redeemed
in whole by the Corporation, under certain circumstances, at a price of
$.0001 per Purchase Right.  The Purchase Rights expire on January 2, 2000.

On January 10, 1995, the Corporation declared a dividend of $.05 per share to
common shareholders of record on January 20, 1995 payable January 25, 1995.

16 - Employee Stock Ownership Plan

The Corporation established an Employees' Stock Ownership Plan ("ESOP").  The
ESOP has been funded by a $100 contribution from the Corporation.  At
December 31, 1994 and 1993, the ESOP held no shares of the Corporation's
stock.

</TABLE>
Cash and Due from Banks and Federal Funds Sold

The carrying amount for cash and due from banks approximates fair value.  The
carrying amounts for short-term investments approximate fair value because
they mature in 90 days or less and do not present unanticipated credit
concerns.

Investment Securities, Securities Available
for Sale and Mortgage-Backed Securities

The fair value of investment securities and mortgage-backed securities,
except certain state and municipal securities, is estimated based on bid
prices published in financial newspapers or bid quotations received from
securities dealers.  The fair value of certain state and municipal securities
is not readily available through market sources other than dealer quotations,
so fair value estimates are based on quoted market prices of similar
instruments, adjusted for differences between the quoted instruments and the
instruments being valued.

Loans

Fair values are estimated for portfolios of loans with similar financial
characteristics.  Loans are segregated by type such as commercial, commercial
real estate, residential mortgage, and other consumer.  Each loan category is
further segmented into fixed and adjustable rate interest terms and by
performing and non-performing categories.

The fair value of performing loans, except residential mortgages, is
calculated by discounting scheduled cash flows through the estimated maturity
using estimated market discount rates that reflect the credit and interest
rate risk inherent in the loan.  The estimate of maturity is based on the
Corporation's historical experience with repayments for each loan
classification, modified, as required, by an estimate of the effect of
current economic and lending conditions.  For performing residential mortgage
loans, fair value is estimated by discounting contractual cash flows adjusted
for prepayment estimates using discount rates based on secondary market
sources adjusted to reflect differences in servicing and credit costs.

Fair value for significant non-performing loans is based on recent external
appraisals.  If appraisals are not available, estimated cash flows are
discounted using a rate commensurate with the risk associated with the
estimated cash flows.  Assumptions regarding credit risk, cash flows, and
discount rates are judgmentally determined using available market information
and specific borrower information.

Accrued Interest Receivable,
Interest Payable on Deposits

The carrying amount for these items approximate the fair value due to their
short-term nature.

Deposits

The fair value of deposits with no stated maturity, such as non-interest
bearing demand deposits, regular savings, and NOW accounts, and money market
and checking accounts, is equal to the amount payable on demand.  The fair
value of certificates of deposit is based on the discounted value of
contractual cash flows.  The discount rate is estimated using the rates
currently offered for deposits of similar remaining maturities.

Borrowed Funds

The fair value of such borrowings was estimated by utilizing future cash
flows discounted using the Bank's current borrowing rate for similar
instruments.

                                       (34)

Westbank Corporation and Subsidiaries


Commitments to Extend Credit
<TABLE>
The stated value of commitments to extend credit approximates fair value as
the current fees charged for similar commitments does not differ
significantly from quoted fees.  For fixed-rate loan commitments, fair value
also considers the difference between current levels of interest rates and
the committed rates.  Such differences are not considered significant.
