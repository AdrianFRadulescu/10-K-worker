Chairman s and President s Letter
Westbank Corporation and Subsidiaries

Dear Shareholder:

We continued in 1995 to fulfill the pledge we made to you four years
ago.  We said then that we were determined to restore profitability,
build capital, improve productivity and position ourselves for the
opportunities of this decade.  We ve done exactly that.

Westbank Corporation achieved record earnings and profitability in
1995 as we more fully realized the benefits of strategies we have
been pursuing for the past four years.

The Corporation earned a record net income of $2,353,000, or $.72
per share, an 8% increase over the previous year.

Our progress is no accident.  It comes from design and hard work.
For four years, we have followed a strategy of becoming the most
progressive independent, locally- owned community bank in Western
Massachusetts.  In the process, we first took the steps necessary to
ensure our survival at a time when many New England banks were
failing.  We then worked through a recovery phase to restore our
financial strength.  We are now well poised to gain competitive
advantage in the marketplace and to attain our long-term goals of
increased profitability and enhanced shareholder value.

With our record 1995 results, the Board of Directors raised the
quarterly cash dividend rate 20% to $.06 per share.  This was a
tribute to those shareholders who stood by patiently while
supporting our efforts to bring the company back to financial
health.

Westbank Corporation s 1995 performance produced returns on average
assets and shareholders equity of .93% and 14.04% respectively.  The
Corporation s book value also increased to $5.41 as compared to
$4.79 per share in 1994.

One of our goals last year was to deliver financial services to
individuals and local businesses in a way that creates customer
loyalty and steady earnings growth.  We strove to achieve this goal
by emphasizing asset quality and by maintaining high underwriting
standards and active loan servicing programs while aggressively
reserving against, managing and disposing of nonaccrual assets.

Lagging economic recovery did not hinder our community commercial
lenders from achieving loan growth in 1995, with total loans at year
end of $197.3 million, an increase of more than $4.5 million over
1994.

Westbank s investment portfolio totaled $35.1 million at year end
compared to $29.5 million at the end of 1994, an increase of 18%,
and included the origination and creation of $8.9 million of
mortgage-backed securities.

Total deposits of $228 million include an increase of more than $3.6
million or 9% in new demand deposit accounts over the previous year.
Growth in loans, investments and demand deposits enabled the
Corporation to maintain a net interest margin of 4.94% for the year
ended, with net interest income increasing by $874 thousand or 8%
compared to 1994.

Westbank seeks to increase earnings through careful asset growth and
by managing interest rate risk to maximize net interest income over
time in changing interest rate environments, while meeting customers
changing needs for deposit and loan products.  The Corporation also
earns fee income from checking and deposit services and from
residential and commercial loan origination and loan servicing.

The Corporation controls expenses by delivering financial services
to its growing customer base in an efficient manner.  Westbank has
expanded its customer base and achieved economies of scale in the
last four years.  During 1995, we successfully continued our quest
to reduce the level of operating expenses, with the Cor-poration s
core expenses declining by more than $80 thousand dollars, resulting
in a most enviable efficiency ratio of 59%.

At year-end, the Corporation s capital totaled $17.7 million, an
increase of more than $2 million or 15.4% compared to year end 1994
and the Corporation s capital ratio was 6.98%.  Under Federal
Deposit Insurance Corporation guidelines, our capital ratio exceeds
the numeric criteria for a well- capitalized bank.

<PAGE>

Westbank s longstanding commitment to address the needs of our local
communities continues.  The health of our business is tied to the
health of the communities we serve, including low and
moderate-income neighborhoods.  Success in achieving this goal is
evident by a regulatory rating of outstanding from the Federal
Deposit Insurance Corporation after its recent community
reinvestment examination of the Corporation s wholly owned
subsidiary, Park West Bank and Trust Company.

The progress we made last year is gratifying, but we do not
underestimate the work ahead to become the best community bank in
the markets we serve.  We ve resolved to build on our core business
strengths and our deep-rooted customer relationships.  Our
mark-eting campaign entitled We have our roots where other banks
have their branches encourages customers who want to establish
deep-rooted banking relation-ships to abandon those big out- of-town
banks and open their accounts at Westbank.

We improved our competitive position by opening supermarket branches
in the Edwards Super Food Stores in Westfield and Chicopee.  The
success of these new ventures has been rewarding and we await
regulatory approval to open our third supermarket branch in the
Edwards Super Food Store in East Long-meadow.  Supermarket branches
are very successful in other areas of the country and we are in the
forefront of this banking innovation.

Park West Bank and Trust Company s Trust Division has a reputation
to be a very professional and concerned provider of personal service
to those clients having a fiduciary relationship with the Bank.
During the past four years our Trust Division has grown 33% in book
value for trust and agency accounts under investment management.
During the same period trust income increased 39% over total
operating expenses.  The book value of assets held by the Trust
Division in various fiduciary capacities is $102,315,000.  In today
s environment, the Trust Division continues to maintain a
conservative investment posture mindful of its fiduciary
responsibility as a long-term investment manager for a variety of
account types.

Because of recent banking merger and acquisition activity in Western
Massachusetts, Westbank s Trust Division is an attractive
alternative for individuals who want the expertise of large
institutions in conjunction with the caring and understanding found
only in a community bank such as Westbank.

As we move forward, our focus is to build upon our solid retail
banking foundation.  Particular areas of emphasis in 1996 will be
our goals of increased lending volume, growth in non-interest
income, maintenance of asset quality, and control of overhead
expenses.  We will pursue these goals while retaining our focus on
superior customer service and, above all, the enhancement of our
shareholders investment.

The future holds the familiar challenges of a changing interest rate
environment, increased consolidation in the industry, and heavy
competition in our market.  We are confident, however, that we have
the resources and the market presence to strengthen our competitive
position and effect our central purpose of building value through
people.

Our Board of Directors and employees are an integral part of
Westbank s success.  The results of their diligent efforts were
highly evident last year and their continued dedication will keep
moving us in the right direction in 1996.  We would also like to
express our appreciation to our shareholders.  Your support will
help ensure another successful year of Making the vision a reality.

Sincerely,

Alfred C. Whitaker              Donald R. Chase 
Chairman of the Board           President and Chief Executive Officer

Business
Westbank Corporation and Subsidiaries

Corporate Organization

Westbank Corporation (hereinafter sometimes referred to as Westbank
or the Corporation ) is a registered Bank Holding Company organized
to facilitate the expansion and diversification of the business of
Park West Bank and Trust Company (hereinafter sometimes referred to
as Park West or the Bank ) into additional financial services
related to banking.

Park West Bank and Trust Company

Substantially all operating income and net income of the Corporation
are presently accounted for by Park West.  Park West is chartered as
a state bank and trust company by the Commonwealth of Massachusetts,
is a member of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation ( FDIC ),
and is subject to regulation by the Massachusetts Commissioner of
Banks and the FDIC.  A full range of retail banking services is
furnished to individuals, businesses, and nonprofit organizations
through ten banking offices located in Hampden County.  Such
services include a wide range of checking and savings accounts,
loans, safe deposit facilities, and automated teller machines at
selected branch locations.

Park West also provides lending, depository and related financial
services to commercial, industrial, financial, and governmental
customers.  In the lending area, these include short and long term
loans and revolving credit arrangements, letters of credit,
inventory and accounts receivable financing, real estate
construction lending, and mortgage loans.

Park West also operates a Trust Department providing services
normally associated with holding property in a fiduciary or agency
capacity.  The value of the property held by the Trust Department at
December 31, 1995 amounted to $102,315,000 and is not included in
the accompanying financial statements since such items are not
assets of the Bank.

Employees

As of December 31, 1995, the Corporation and its subsidiaries had an
equivalent of 111 full time officers and staff.

Competition

Westbank s banking, real estate activity and trust services are
competitive with other Massachusetts financial institutions.  Its
service area is in Western Massachusetts, primarily Hampden County.
Westbank s competitors include other commercial banks, mutual
savings banks, savings and loan associations, credit unions,
consumer finance companies, loan offices, money market funds, and
other financing organizations.

Competition for trust services by major commercial banks is high,
with continuing efforts by those banks to solicit new business.  The
Trust Department prides itself as one of the few remaining corporate
fiduciaries providing personal services locally.  Insurance
companies, mutual savings banks, investment counseling firms, and
other business firms and individuals also offer active competition
for such business.

Management s Discussion and Analysis - Financial Results
Westbank Corporation and Subsidiaries

Management s discussion of operations and financial position is
based on the selected consolidated financial data and should be read
in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and notes
thereto.

For 1995, the Corporation reported net income of $2,353,000 or $.72
per share after providing $2,690,000 for loan losses and $224,000
for other real estate owned (OREO), mainly in response to further
declines in the real estate industry and the New England economy.
This compares to net income for 1994 of $2,175,000, or $.68 per
share.  The Corporation s 1994 earnings reflected a provision for
loan losses of $1,473,000 and $760,000 for OREO.  Net interest
income increased $874,000 from 1994 to 1995.

Non-interest expense, excluding the write-down of OREO and related
operating expenses, amounted to $8,017,000 in 1995 compared to
$8,852,000 in 1994, a decrease of $835,000, or 9%.  Non-interest
expense for 1994 reflects the write-down of $750,000 as the result
of the employee defalcation as reported in the Corporation s 1994
Annual Report to Shareholders.  During 1995, the Corporation filed
an insurance claim for the full amount of the loss, and an insurance
refund totaling $703,000 was received by the Corporation during
October 1995 and is reflected in non-interest income.

Non-interest income increased by $458,000 from 1994 and reflects the
recovery noted above, as well as an increase in Trust Department
earnings and a decrease in service charges on deposit accounts of
$111,000.  Decreases in gain on sale of mortgages and sale of other
real estate owned totaling $150,000 were the result of fewer sales
during 1995 and overall market conditions.

Income taxes in 1995 totaled $1,080,000 an increase of $1,510,000
over 1994.  Included in the 1994 results of operations is a tax
benefit totaling $430,000.  The benefit is primarily attributable to
the utilization of net operating loss carryforwards of $237,000 and
a decrease in the valuation allowance for deferred tax assets due to
a change in judgement about the realizability of such deferred tax
assets.

At December 31, 1995, the Corporation s total assets were
$253,777,000, an increase of $10,464,000, or 4.3%, from $243,313,000
at year end 1994.  The higher level of assets resulted primarily
through an increase in net loans and investments totaling
$10,156,000 funded by the growth in deposits.

Non-performing assets amounted to $7,904,000, or 3.11% of total
assets at December 31, 1995, compared with $7,435,000 or 3.06% at
the end of 1994.

Since December 1994, Park West has been operating under a Memorandum
of Understanding (the Memorandum ) with the Federal Deposit
Insurance Corporation (the FDIC ) and the Commissioner of Banks for
the Commonwealth of Massachusetts (the Commissioner ). On December
11, 1995 the Memorandum was revised.  The Memorandum is an informal
agreement with the FDIC and the Commissioner requiring Park West,
among other things, to maintain a leverage capital ratio of at least
6%, to develop a written plan of action to lessen its risk exposure
to certain borrowers and to refrain from extending or renewing
credit to any borrower who has a loan or extension of credit with
Park West that has been charged off or classified, without first
obtaining majority approval of Park West s Board of Directors.  Park
West must maintain the allowance for loan losses at a level
commensurate to the risk in the loan portfolio and correct other
deficiencies noted in the exam.  The Memorandum requires Park West
to obtain approval from the FDIC and the Commissioner prior to
paying or declaring a dividend.  Finally, Park West is required to
make quarterly reports to the FDIC and the Commissioner detailing
the form and manner of action taken to secure compliance with the
Memorandum.

The Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation Improvement Act of 1991 (
FDICIA ) imposes significant regulatory restrictions and
requirements on banking institutions insured by the FDIC and their
holding companies.  FDICIA established capital categories into which
financial institutions are placed based on capital level.  Each
capital category establishes different degrees of regulatory
restrictions which can apply to a financial institution.  As of
December 31, 1995, Park West s capital was at a level that placed
the Bank in the well capitalized category as defined by FDICIA.

FDICIA imposes a variety of other restrictions and requirements on
insured banks.  These include significant regulatory reporting
requirements such as insuring that a system of risk-based deposit
insurance premiums and civil money penalties for inaccurate deposit
assessment reports exist.  In addition, FDICIA imposes a system of
regulatory standards for bank and bank holding company operations,
detailed truth in savings disclosure requirements, and restrictions
on activities authorized by state law but not authorized for
national banks.

Management s Discussion and Analysis - Financial Results (Continued)
Westbank Corporation and Subsidiaries 

The weak economy and real estate market continues to impair the
financial results of the Corporation.  Despite these weaknesses the
Corporation has managed significant improvements in earnings and
asset quality.  As a result of the continued aggressive management
of problem loans and an on-going expense reduction program, the
board of directors and management believe the Corporation is
positioned to comply with the Memorandum as well as the requirements
of FDICIA.

Components of Capital

The following table presents the Corporation s components of Tier 1
leverage capital as of December 31.  The table also presents the

</TABLE>

Regulatory risk-based capital requirements take into account the
different risk categories of banking organizations by assigning risk
weights to assets and the credit equivalent amounts of off-balance
sheet exposures.  In addition, capital is divided into two tiers.
In this Corporation, Tier 1 includes the common stockholders equity;
Tier 2, or supplementary capital, includes not only the equity, but
also a portion of the allowance for loan losses.

The following are the Corporation s risk-based capital ratios at
December 31, 1995:

Tier 1 risk-based capital (minimum required 4%)    9.98%
Total risk-based capital (minimum required 8%)    11.24%

Asset/Liability Management and Interest Rate Sensitivity

The following table sets forth the distribution of the repricing of
Westbank s earning assets and interest bearing liabilities as of
December 31, 1995, the interest rate sensitivity gap, (i.e.,
interest rate sensitive assets less interest rate sensitive
liabilities), the cumulative interest rate sensitivity gap, the
interest rate sensitivity gap ratio and the cumulative interest rate
sensitivity gap ratio.  The table also sets forth the time periods
in which earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities will mature
or may reprice in accordance with their contractual terms.  However,
the table does not necessarily indicate the impact of general
interest rate movements on the net interest margin since the
repricing of various categories of assets and liabilities is subject
to competitive pressures and the needs of Westbank s customers.  In
addition, various assets and liabilities indicated as repricing
within the same period may in fact reprice at different times within
such period and at different rates.

The presentation of a run off and repricing of savings accounts and
NOW accounts is based on the Corporation s historical experience
with $3,193,000 and $1,711,000, respectively, included in the three
month to one year category and the remainder placed in the one to
five year category of the interest bearing liabilities.

Westbank seeks to manage the mix of asset and liability maturities
to control the effect of changes in the general level of interest
rates on net interest income.  In periods of rising interest rates,
Westbank s negative interest rate sensitivity gap as to earning
assets and interest-bearing liabilities maturing in less than one
year may cause a diminution of Westbank s income; correspondingly,
in periods of declining interest rates, a negative interest rate
sensitivity gap may provide additional income.  Except for its
effect on the general level of interest rates, inflation does not
have a material impact on Westbank s earnings due to the rate of
variability and short-term maturities of its earning assets.

Distribution of Assets, Liabilities and Stockholders Equity -
Interest Rates and Interest Differential

The following table presents the condensed average balance sheets
for 1995, 1994 and 1993.  The total dollar amount of interest income
from earning assets and the resultant yields are calculated on a
taxable equivalent basis.  The interest paid on interest-bearing
liabilities, expressed both in dollars and rates, is also shown in
the table:

(a) Interest income on non-taxable investment securities and loans
    includes the effects of tax equivalent adjustments using the
    marginal federal tax rate of 34% in adjusting tax exempt
    interest income to a fully taxable basis.  
     
(b) Average loan balances above include non-accrual loans.  When a
    loan is placed in non-accrual status, interest income is
    recorded to the extent actually received in cash or is applied
    to reduce principal.

During 1995, the yield spread declined to 4.16% from 4.46% in 1994
down 30 basis points.  The Corporation s net interest margin
decreased during 1995 to 4.94% from 5.01% in 1994 a decrease of 7
basis points.  The section titled rate volume analysis further
describes the change in yields.

* The dollar amount of changes in interest income and interest
expense attributable to changes in rate/volume has been allocated
between rate and volume based on changes in rates times the prior
year s volume and the changes in volume times the prior year s rate.

Net interest income on a taxable equivalent basis for 1995 increased
to $11,732,000, up 7.9% from $10,870,000 in 1994.  A 9.5% increase
in average earning assets and a 67 basis point increase in average
rate of return resulted in an increase in volume of $1,618,000 and a
increase in rate of $1,585,000.  An increase of 7.3% in average
interest bearing liabilities and a 97 basis point increase in
average rate of interest paid contributed to an increase in volume
and rate of $808,000 and $1,533,000, respectively.

Liquidity

Liquidity management requires close scrutiny of the mix and maturity
of deposits and borrowings and short-term investments.  Cash and due
from banks, federal funds sold, investment securities and
mortgage-backed securities, as compared to deposits, are used by
Westbank to compute its liquidity on a daily basis as adjusted for
regulatory purposes.  At December 31, 1995, Westbank s ratio of such
assets to total deposits was 16.61%.  In addition, Westbank is
subject to Regulation D of the Federal Reserve Bank (FRB), which
requires depository institutions to maintain reserve balances on
deposit with the FRB based on certain average depositor balances.
Westbank is in compliance with Regulation D. Management of Westbank
believes that its current liquidity is sufficient to meet current
and anticipated funding needs.  Refer to Note 7 in the Notes To
Consolidated Financial Statements for a discussion of the
Corporation s external sources of liquidity.

Loan Loss Experience

The provision for loan losses is an amount added to the allowance
against which loan losses are charged.  The provision for losses is
dependent on actual net write-offs and an evaluation as to the
collectibility of the loan portfolio taking into consideration such
factors as the financial condition of individual borrowers,
historical loss experience with respect to various portfolio
segments, current and near term economic conditions, and the size of
the portfolio.  Based on these reviews, the allowance for loan
losses at December 31, 1995, is deemed to be adequate by management.
In the determination of the allowance for loan losses management
obtains independent appraisals for a significant number of
properties.  Management has also retained an independent loan review
consultant to provide advice on the adequacy of the loan loss
allowance.

<TABLE>
The following table sets forth the historical relationship among the
average amount of loans outstanding, the allowance for loan losses,
provision for loan losses charged to operating expenses, losses
charged off, recoveries and selected ratios:

The approach the Corporation uses in determining the adequacy of the
allowance for loan losses is the combination of a target reserve and
general reserve allocation.  Quarterly, based on an internal review
of the loan portfolio, the Corporation identifies required reserve
allocations targeted to recognized problem loans that, in the
opinion of management, have potential loss exposure or questions
relative to the adequacy of the collateral on these same loans.  In
addition, the Corporation allocates a general reserve against the
remainder of the loan portfolio.

Non-Performing Assets

Loans

<TABLE>
Loans on which interest and principal payments are 90 days or more
past due are placed on a non-accrual basis (earlier if deemed
appropriate) and interest is reversed unless management determines
that the collectibility of principal and interest is not reasonably
considered in doubt.  The following table sets forth information
with regard to non-performing loans as of the end of each year
indicated:

</TABLE>

The gross amount of interest that would have been accrued at the
original contract rate on loans on a non-accrual basis (in
thousands) was $354, $342, $126, $124, and $346 for 1995, 1994,
1993, 1992, and 1991, respectively.  Interest income included in the
results of operations relating to these loans was $20,000 in 1994.

The increase in non-accrual loans from 1994 is attributable to
management moving two loans totaling approximately $4,000,000 to
non-performing status during the third quarter of 1995.  The
classification to non-performing status was in response to
deterioration of these two borrowers and managements aggressive
action in an attempt to resolve them.  Each of the loans is real
estate related.  The increase in the provision for loan losses and
charge offs during 1995 are directly related to the loans referred
to above.

As described in Note 1, on January 1, 1995 the Bank adopted
Statement of Financial Accounting Standards ( SFAS ) No.  114,
Accounting by Creditors for Impairment of a Loan, as amended by SFAS
No.  118, Accounting for Creditors for Impairment of a Loan - Income
Recognition and Disclosures.

Under this guidance the Bank measures impairment of commercial loans
by using the present value of expected future cash flows discounted
at the loan s effective interest rate.  Commercial real estate loans
are generally measured based on the fair value of the underlying
collateral.  Smaller balance homogenous loans, including residential
real estate and consumer loans, are collectively evaluated for
impairment.

Westbank Corporation and Subsidiaries 

The Bank evaluates each impaired loan to determine the income
recognition policy.  Generally, income is recorded only on a cash
basis for impaired loans.  Interest income recognized during 1995 on
impaired loans was not significant.

At December 31, 1995, the recorded investment in impaired loans was
$4,735,000, for which no additional specific allowance for loan
losses was recorded.  For the twelve months ended December 31, 1995,
the average recorded investment in impaired loans was $2,201,000.

As a result of adopting SFAS 114, in-substance foreclosures
totalling $1,979,000, $5,988,000 and $575,000 as of December 31,
1993, 1992 and 1991, respectively, were reclassified to loans and
are included in non-accrual loans above.

Restructured Loans

A restructured loan is one for which the Corporation has modified
the contractual terms to provide a reduction in the rate of interest
and, in most instances, an extension of payments of principal or
interest or both because of a deterioration in the financial
position of the borrower.  Restructured loans modified prior to
December 31, 1994 which are performing in accordance with their new
terms are not included in non-accrual loans unless concern exists as
to the ultimate collection of principal or inte rest and are not
considered to be impaired.  Those entered into after December 31,
1994 are considered to be impaired as defined by SFAS No.  114
described above.  Restructured loans, which are classified as
accruing loans, amounted to $439,000 in 1995, $501,000 in 1994,
$494,000 in 1993, $420,000 in 1992 and none during 1991.  The
average current yield on these loans was approximately 8.67% for
1995.  The following is an analysis of interest income related to
restructured loans which are classified as accruing loans:

Interest Income

Westbank s earning assets include a diverse portfolio of interest
earning instruments ranging from Westbank s core business of loan
extensions to interest-bearing securities issued by federal, state
and municipal authorities.  These earning assets are financed
through a combination of interest-bearing and interest-free sources.

Management s Discussion and Analysis - Financial Results (Continued)
Westbank Corporation and Subsidiaries 

Total interest income for 1995 amounted to $20,261,000 as compared
to $17,046,000 for 1994 and $16,809,000 for 1993.  For 1995 this
represents an increase of $3,215,000 or 19% over 1994, while
interest income increased by $237,000 or 1.4% in 1994 versus 1993.
The increase in 1995 is the result of an increase in average earning
assets of $20,508,000 or 9% and an increase of 67 basis points in
average earning interest rate.  The increase in 1994 over 1993 is
the result of an increase in average earning assets of $8,622,000
combined with a 21 basis point reduction in average earning interest
rate.

Interest Expense

Interest expense for 1995 on deposits and borrowings amounted to
$8,540,000 as compared to $6,199,000 in 1994 and $6,736,000 for
1993.  Interest expense increased by $2,341,000 or 37% during 1995
compared to 1994 and 1994 interest expense declined by $537,000 or
8% versus 1993.  The 1995 increase is the result of an increase of
average interest bearing liabilities of $13,217,000 and a 97 basis
point increase in the average rate of interest paid compared to
1994.  The decline in interest expense during 1994 versus 1993 is
the result of a decrease of average interest bearing liabilities of
$2,717,000 combined with a decrease of 24 basis points on average
interest rate paid.

Net Interest Income

Net interest income, the most significant component of earnings, is
the amount by which the interest generated by assets exceeds the
interest expense on liabilities.  For analytical purposes, the
interest earned on tax exempt assets is adjusted to a tax equivalent
basis using statutory rates to recognize the income tax savings
which facilitates comparison between taxable and tax exempt assets.

Westbank s management analyzes its performance by utilizing the
concepts of interest rate spread and net yield on earning assets.
The interest rate spread represents the difference between the yield
on earning assets and interest paid on interest-bearing liabilities.
The net yield on earning assets is the difference between the rate
of interest on earning assets and the effective rate paid on all
funds, interest-bearing liabilities, as well as interest-free
sources (primarily demand deposits and stockholders equity).

Provision for Loan Losses

The 1995 provision for loan losses totalled $2,690,000 compared with
$1,473,000 in 1994, an increase of 83%.  During 1994 the provision
increased by $683,000 over 1993 representing an increase of 86%.
The increase in the provision for loan losses during 1995 is
directly attributable to the increase in non-performing loans
primarily during the third quarter, and managements aggressive
action in attempting to resolve them.  A full discussion appears
previously under the headings of LOAN LOSS EXPERIENCE and
NON-PERFORMING ASSETS.

Non-Interest Income

Income from sources other than interest was $2,917,000 in 1995, an
increase of $458,000 from the prior year and an increase of $56,000
versus 1993.  Non-interest income for 1995 reflects an increase in
Trust Department earnings, a decrease in service charges on deposit
accounts of $111,000 and decreases from the gain on sale of
mortgages and sale of other real estate owned totaling $150,000
compared to 1994.  1995 also reflects the recovery of an insurance
claim totaling $703,000 relating to the loss resulting from the
employee defalcation previously discussed.

Overall non-interest expense declined during 1995 by $1,573,000
versus 1994 and $1,557,000 compared to 1993.  During 1995 salaries
and benefits decreased by $94,000 reflecting the savings of
outsourcing the Corporation s transit and statement rendering
functions offset partially as a result of two new branch locations
and the associated staffing requirements.  Similarly, occupancy
decreased by $42,000 as a result of the outsourcing described above.
Other real estate owned expenses declined by $738,000 during 1995
the result of less real estate under management by the Bank during
the current year.  Finally, other non-interest expense decreased in
1995 by $699,000, the result of the Corporation reflecting a loss of
$750,000 in 1994 for the alleged employee defalcation previously
discussed.

Income Taxes

The Financial Accounting Standards Board issued a Statement of
Financial Accounting Standard No.  109, Accounting for Income Taxes
( SFAS No.  109 ) in February, 1992.  The Statement requires the
recognition of deferred tax assets, net of applicable reserves,
related to net operating loss carryforwards and certain temporary
differences.  Effective January 1, 1993, the Corporation
prospectively adopted SFAS No.  109, resulting in a $400,000 benefit
which has been reported as a cumulative effect of the change in
accounting principle.

For the year ended December 31, 1995 Westbank Corporation recorded a
tax expense of $1,080,000 compared to 1994, when the Corporation
recorded a tax benefit of $430,000, which was primarily the result
of the utilization of net operating loss carryforwards of $237,000
and a decrease in a valuation allowance of $771,000 pertaining to
deferred tax assets offset by the provision for current taxes.

Income taxes for 1993 totaled $525,000 offset by a $400,000 benefit
recorded as a cumulative effect of accounting change for income
taxes, which is the result of the Corporation adopting SFAS No.
109.

Net Income

The net income for 1995 of $2,353,000, or $.72 per share, is based
on a weighted average of 3,271,875 shares outstanding, compared with
a net income for 1994 of $2,175,000, or $.68 based on a weighted
average of 3,203,985 shares outstanding and net income for 1993 of
$1,947,000 or $.61 based on a weighted average shares of 3,190,486.

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements
Westbank Corporation and Subsidiaries

1 - Summary of Significant 
        Accounting Policies

The accounting and reporting policies of Westbank Corporation (the
Corporation ) and its subsidiaries are in conformity with generally
accepted accounting principles and general practices within the
banking industry.  The following is a description of the more
significant policies.

Nature of Operations

The Corporation operates ten banking offices located in Hampden
County and also operates a Trust Department providing services
normally associated with holding property in a fiduciary or agency
capacity.  A full range of retail banking services are furnished to
individuals, businesses and non-profit organizations.  The
Corporation s primary source of revenue is providing loans to
customers, predominately located in Western Massachusetts.

Use of Estimates in the Preparation of Financial Statements

The preparation of the financial statements in conformity with
generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make
estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets
and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities
at the date of the financial statements.

Material estimates that are particularly susceptible to significant
change relate to the determination of the allowance for loan losses
and the valuation of real estate acquired in connection with
foreclosures or in satisfaction of loans.  In connection with the
determination of the allowances for loan losses and other real
estate owned, management obtains independent appraisals for
significant properties.

In addition, various regulatory agencies, as an integral part of
their examination process, periodically review the Bank s allowances
for losses on loans and other real estate owned.  Such agencies may
require the Bank to recognize additions to the allowances based on
their judgements about information available to them at the time of
their examination.

Basis of Presentation and Consolidation

The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the
Corporation and its wholly-owned subsidiary, Park West Bank and
Trust Company ( Park West or the Bank ), its subsidiaries, Lorac
Leasing Corp., and PWB&T Inc.  All material intercompany balances
and transactions have been eliminated upon consolidation.  Certain
amounts in the 1994 and 1993 financial statements have been
reclassified to conform to the 1995 presentation.

Cash and Cash Equivalents

The Corporation defines cash and due from banks and federal funds
sold to be cash equivalents.

Securities

Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No.  115, Accounting for
Certain Investment in Debt and Equity Securities ( SFAS No.  115 )
addresses the accounting and reporting for investments in equity
securities that have readily determinable fair values and for all
investments in debt securities.  Those investments are to be
classified in three categories and accounted for as follows:

Held to Maturity Securities - reported at amortized cost.

Trading Securities - reported at fair value with unrealized
gains/losses included in earnings.

Available for Sale - reported at fair value, with unrealized
gains/losses, net of income taxes, excluded from earnings and
reported as a separate component of shareholders equity.

Securities that management has the positive intent and ability to
hold until maturity are stated at cost, adjusted for amortization of
premiums and accretion of discounts.  Those securities which have
been identified as assets for which there is not a positive intent
to hold to maturity, including all marketable equity securities, are
classified as available for sale with unrealized gains (losses), net
of income taxes reported as a separate component of shareholders
equity.  The Corporation classifies all securities with an original
maturity of less than three years as available for sale.  In
addition, any mortgage-backed securities created out of the Banks
own inventory of residential real estate loans are also considered
available for sale.  All other securities are classified as held to
maturity.  Gains and losses on sales of securities are recognized at
the time of sale on a specific identification basis.

Mortgage-backed securities held to maturity are stated at cost,
adjusted for amortization of premiums and accretion of discounts
determined by a method that approximates the level-yield method.
Management has the positive ability and the intent to hold these
assets until maturity.

Loans

Loans have been reduced by deferred loan fees and the allowance for
loan losses.

Interest on commercial and real estate loans is accrued on the
principal amount of loans outstanding.  Interest on discounted
installment loans is recognized by a method which approximates the
interest method.  Interest on other loans, is calculated by using
the simple interest method on daily balances of the principal amount
outstanding.

Non-accrual loans are loans on which the accrual of interest ceases
when the collection of principal or interest payments is determined
to be doubtful by management.  It is the general policy of the
Corporation to discontinue the accrual of interest when principal or
interest payments are delinquent 90 days or more unless the loan
principal and interest are determined by management to be fully
collectible.  Any unpaid amounts previously accrued on these loans
are reversed from income.  Interest received where a loan is in
non-accrual status is applied to reduce principal or, if management
determines that the principal is collectible, interest is recognized
on a cash basis.  A loan is returned to accrual status after the
borrower has brought the loan current and has demonstrated
compliance with the loan terms for a sufficient period and
management s doubts concerning collectibility have been removed.

The adequacy of the allowance for loan losses is evaluated regularly
by management.  Factors considered in evaluating the adequacy of the
allowance include the size of the portfolio, previous loss
experience, current economic conditions and their effect on
borrowers and the financial condition of individual borrowers and
the related performance of individual loans in relation to contract
terms.  The provision for loan losses charged to operating expense
is based upon management s judgement of the amount necessary to
maintain the allowance at a level adequate to absorb losses.  Loan
losses are charged against the allowance for loan losses when
management believes the collectibility of the principal is unlikely.

Loan origination fees, net of certain direct loan origination costs,
are deferred and recognized as income over the life of the related
loan as an adjustment to the loan s yield.

On January 1, 1995, the Corporation adopted Statement of Financial
Accounting Standards No.  114, Accounting by Creditors for
Impairment of a Loan , ( SFAS No.  114 ) which requires that certain
impaired loans, except large groups of smaller balance homogeneous
loans that are collectively evaluated for impairment, be measured
based on the present value of expected future cash flows discounted
at the loan s effective interest rate or, as a practical expedient,
at the loan s observable market price or the fair value of the
collateral if the loan is collateral dependent.  SFAS No.  114 was
modified by SFAS No.  118, Accounting by Creditors for Impairment of
a Loan - Income Recognition and Disclosures, and was adopted
concurrently by the Corporation.  The adoption of these new
standards did not have any material impact on the Corporation s
financial statements.

New Accounting Standards 

The Corporation has not adopted Statement of Financial Accounting
Standards No.  122, Accounting for Mortgage Servicing Rights , (
SFAS No.  122 ) which is effective for fiscal years beginning after
December 15, 1995.  This statement requires allocation of the total
cost of mortgage loans to the mortgage servicing rights and the
loans (without the mortgage servicing rights) based on their
relative fair values.  It is not anticipated that the adoption of
this standard will have a material impact on the Corporation s
financial statements.

Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No.  123, Accounting for
Stock-Based Compensation , ( SFAS No.  123 ) is effective for fiscal
years beginning after December 15, 1995.  This statement encourages,
but does not require, employers to adopt a fair value method of
accounting for employee stock-based compensation.  Regardless of the
method used for employee stock-based arrangements, SFAS No.  123
requires increased disclosures of stock-based compensation
arrangements with employees.  Management has not assessed the impact
of adoption of this Standard.

These statements apply to Westbank s financial statements as of
January 1, 1996 and will be implemented during the first quarter of
1996.

Property and Equipment

Property and equipment are stated at cost less accumulated
depreciation and amortization.  Depreciation is computed using the
straight-line method.  Amortization of leasehold improvements is
charged over the terms of the respective leases, including option
periods or the estimated useful lives of the improvements, whichever
is shorter.  Gains and losses are recognized upon disposal of
assets.  The cost of maintenance and repairs is charged to income as
incurred, whereas significant renewals are capitalized.

Other Real Estate Owned

Other real estate owned ( OREO ) includes properties the Bank has
acquired through foreclosure.  OREO is recorded at the lower of cost
or fair value at the date of acquisition, less estimated selling
costs.  At the time of foreclosure, the excess, if any, of the loan
amount over the fair value of the asset acquired is charged off
against the allowance for loan losses.  Operating expenses to
administer OREO properties are charged directly to operating
expenses.  Valuation allowances are established subsequent to
acquisition, as necessary, based upon management s continuing
assessment of the fair values of the properties.  Loans granted in
conjunction with sales of OREO are required to comply with the Bank
s standard underwriting criteria, including receipt of an adequate
down payment.

Deferred Premium on Loans Sold

The Corporation sells mortgage loans resulting in gains which are
deferred at the time of the sale when the average interest rate on
the loans sold, after normal servicing fees, differs from the agreed
yield to the buyer.  The premium or discount which results from
these sales is amortized using the interest method over the
estimated remaining life of the servicing contract, adjusted for
estimated prepayments.  Such amortization is charged against
operations based upon amounts considered necessary by management to
reflect accelerated prepayment experience.

Income Taxes

Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No.  109, Accounting for
Income Taxes ( SFAS No.  109 ) established the asset and liability
method of accounting for income taxes.  Under SFAS No.  109,
deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future
tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial
statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and
their respective tax basis.  To the extent that current available
evidence about the future raises doubt about the realization of a
deferred tax asset, a valuation allowance must be established.
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax
rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which
those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled.
Under SFAS No.  109, the effect on deferred tax assets and
liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the
period that includes the enactment date.  The Corporation adopted
SFAS No.  109 on January 1, 1993, and reported the cumulative effect
of that change in the statement of income for the year ended
December 31, 1993.

Pension Plan

The Corporation has a trusteed contributory defined contribution
pension plan covering substantially all employees.  The Corporation
s policy is to fund accrued pension cost.

Trust Department

Assets held by the Corporation for customers in a fiduciary or
agency capacity are not included in the consolidated financial
statements, as such items are not assets of the Cor-poration.  Such
assets totaled approximately $102,315,000 and $84,031,000 at
December 31, 1995 and 1994, respectively.  Trust income is
recognized on a cash basis.  The amounts recognized under this
method are not materially different from amounts that would be
recognized on the accrual basis.

Net Earnings Per Share

The computation of earnings per share is based on the weighted
average number of shares of common stock and common stock
equivalents outstanding during the year.

The aggregate principal balance of non-accrual loans was $6,180,000,
$4,890,000 and $3,057,000 at December 31, 1995, 1994 and 1993,
respectively.  Contractual interest income which was not recognized
on such non-accrual loans was $354,000, $342,000 and $126,000 for
1995, 1994 and 1993, respectively.  The only income included in the
results of operations for these non-accrual loans was $20,000 during
1994.

The Corporation did not sell any loans with recourse during 1995.
The remaining recourse exposure on prior sales was $5,014,000 at
December 31, 1995.  Management does not believe that its recourse
obligations subject the Corporation to any material risk of loss in
the future.  The Corporation has suffered no losses as a result of
these recourse obligations.

Of the $157,069,000 in real estate loans at December 31, 1995,
$99,321,000 are collateralized by 1-4 family dwel-lings.  The
majority of the collateral for these loans is located in the bank s
direct market area of Western Massachusetts.  Commercial real estate
and real estate construction loans represented $55,116,000 in
outstanding principal at December 31, 1995.  These loans encompass a
wider region extending throughout Massachusetts and Southern New
England.  Most are collateralized by commercial real estate
developments.  Commercial loans both collateralized and
uncollateralized of $35,116,000 at December 31, 1995 represent loans
made to businesses in Western Massachusetts.

The Bank has had, and expects to have in the future, banking
transactions in the ordinary course of business with its directors
and officers.  Such loans, in the opinion of management, do not
include more than the normal risk of collectibility nor other
unfavorable features.

As described in Note 1, on January 1, 1995 the Bank adopted
Statement of Financial Accounting Standards ( SFAS No.  114 ),
Accounting by Creditors for Impairment of a Loan, as amended by SFAS
No.  118, Accounting for Creditors for Impairment of a Loan - Income
Recognition and Disclosures.

Under this guidance the Bank measures impairment of commercial loans
by using the present value of expected future cash flows discounted
at the loan s effective interest rate.  Commercial real estate loans
are generally measured based on the fair value of the underlying
collateral.  Smaller balance homogenous loans, including residential
real estate and consumer loans, are collectively evaluated for
impairment.

The Bank evaluates each impaired loan to determine the income
recognition policy.  Generally, income is recorded only on a cash
basis for impaired loans.  Interest income recognized during 1995 on
impaired loans was not significant.

At December 31, 1995, the recorded investment in impaired loans was
$4,735,000, for which no additional specific allowance for loan
losses was recorded.  For the twelve months ended December 31, 1995,
the average recorded investment in impaired loans was $2,201,000.

The Corporation had no commitments to lend additional funds to these
borrowers having loans which are on non-accrual, impaired or
restructured.  The Corporation serviced loans for others totaling
$153,923,000 and $155,539,000 at December 31, 1995 and 1994,
respectively.

</TABLE>

The net change in the total valuation allowance for the year ended
December 31, 1995 was a decrease of $662,000 mostly due to the
recapture of such benefits.  In assessing the realizability of
deferred tax assets, management considers whether it is more likely
than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will
not be realized.  The ultimate realization of deferred tax assets is
dependent upon the generation of future taxable income during the
periods in which those temporary differences become deductible.

<PAGE>

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued)
Westbank Corporation and Subsidiaries

Management considers the scheduled reversal of deferred tax assets
and liabilities, projected future taxable income, and tax planning
strategies in making this assessment.  Based upon the level of
historical taxable income and projections for future taxable income
over the periods which the deferred tax assets are deductible,
management believes it is more likely than not the Corporation will
realize the benefits of these deductible differences.

9 - Pension Plan

Park West Bank and Trust Company, a wholly-owned subsidiary of the
Corporation, has a contributory defined contribution pension plan
(money purchase), covering substantially all of its employees.
Contributions to the pension plan are a percentage of individual
employees salary.  Total pension expense for 1995, 1994 and 1993
amounted to $216,000, $216,000 and $198,000, respectively.  At May
31, 1995, the most recent plan year, total plan assets were
$2,084,000 and the vested balance was $2,032,000.  The pension plan
assets are invested in money market funds, government bonds,
corporate and government agency bonds and marketable securities.

10 - Stock Options
<TABLE>
The Corporation offers shares of common stock to officers and key
employees pursuant to the 1985 Incentive Stock Option Plan.  On
April 16, 1992, all outstanding options were canceled and 67,913
options at a price of $2 per share were issued.  As of December 31,
1995, all options granted are exercisable.  At the 1994 Annual
Meeting of Sharehold-ers the 1985 Incentive Stock Option Plan was
amended to increase the number of shares reserved for issuance by
200,000 shares.  The following is a summary of the changes in
options outstanding:

          and Financial Instruments with 
          Off-Balance-Sheet Risk

In the normal course of business, various commitments and contingent
liabilities are outstanding, such as guarantees, standby letters of
credit, commitments to extend credit and various financial
instruments with off- balance-sheet risk that are not reflected in
the financial statements.  Financial instruments with
off-balance-sheet risk involve elements of credit risk, interest
rate risk, liquidity risk and market risk.  Management does not
anticipate any significant losses as a result of these transactions.

</TABLE>

The Bank uses the same credit policies in making commitment and
conditional obligations as it does for on-balance-sheet instruments.

Commitments to extend credit are agreements to lend to a customer as
long as there is no violation of any condition established in the
contract.  Commitments generally have fixed expiration dates or
other termination clauses and may require payment of a fee.  Since
commitments may be expected to expire without being drawn upon, the
total commitment amounts do not necessarily represent future cash
requirements.  The Bank evaluates each c ustomer s creditworthiness
on a case-by-case basis.  The amount of collateral obtained, if
deemed necessary by the Bank upon extension of credit, is based on
management s credit evaluation of the borrower.  Collateral held
varies but may include accounts receivable, inventory, property
plant and equipment and income-producing commercial properties.

Generally, all of the Banks loans are to borrowers in the Western
Massachusetts and surrounding areas.  The ability of borrowers to
repay their loans is dependent on the overall economic stability of
the Corporation s market area, real estate values and the net worth
of the borrowers.  A majority of the Corporation s loans are secured
by real estate.

As of December 31, 1995 the Bank has commitments to open two (2)
supermarket branches in Edwards Super Food Stores in Chicopee and
East Longmeadow.  The Chicopee office opened on February 12, 1996
and the East Long-meadow office is scheduled to open in April 1996
pending regulatory approval.  The Corporation anticipates entering
into a lease agreement with Edwards Super Food Store for the East
Longmeadow office and estimates capital expenditures for this office
and the recently opened Chicopee office to be $600,000.

Certain litigation is pending against the Corporation.  Management,
after consultation with legal counsel, does not anticipate that any
ultimate liability arising out of such litigation will have a
material effect on the Corporation s financial condition or results
of operation.

During March 1995 the bank discovered an alleged em-ployee
defalcation of approximately $750,000.  Included in the financial
statements for 1994 is the writedown of this unusual item, while the
1995 financial statements reflect the recovery of this item based on

14 - Stockholders  Equity and Regulatory Matters

As a federally insured banking institution, Park West is subject to
regulation by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (the FDIC ).
On December 22, 1994, in conjunction with an examination by the
Commissioner of Banks for the Commonwealth of Massachusetts (the
Commissioner ), Park West entered into a Memorandum of Understanding
(the Memorandum ) with the Commissioner and the FDIC.  The
Memorandum required Park West to take certain affirmative action in
response to the examination by the Commissioner.  On December 11,
1995, in conjunction with an examination by the FDIC the Memorandum
was revised.  The revised Memorandum requires, among other items:
Park West s Tier 1 capital to total asset ratio remain at or above
6%; Park West to submit written plans to further reduce classified
assets; the Bank to review and/or revise its Investment Policy;
correct other deficiencies noted in the exam; not declare or pay any
dividends without prior approval by the FDIC and the Commissioner.
Park West management believes that the Bank will be able to comply
with all of the terms of the Memorandum.

Note to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued)
Westbank Corporation and Subsidiaries

The Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation Improvement Act of 1991 (
FDICIA ) includes significant changes to the legal and regulatory
environment for insured depository institutions, including
reductions in insurance coverage for certain kinds of deposits,
increased supervision by the federal regulatory agencies, increased
reporting requirements for insured institutions, and new regulations
concerning internal controls, accounting, and operations.

Under the prompt corrective action provisions of FDICIA, specific
capital categories were defined based on an institution s capital
ratios.  To be considered well capitalized an institution must
generally have a leverage ratio of at least 5%, a Tier 1 risk-based
capital ratio of at least 6%, and a total risk-based capital ratio
of at least 10%.

At December 31, 1995, the Bank s leverage ratio was 6.87%, Tier 1
risk-based ratio was 9.81% and total risk-based ratio was 11.07%,
based on leverage capital of $17,446,000, Tier 1 capital of
$17,380,000, and total risk-based capital of $19,613,000, as
defined.  At December 31, 1995, the institution is classified as
well capitalized as defined under FDICIA as described above.
Westbank Corporation has adopted a Shareholders Rights Plan.  The
plan provides for the distribution of one Common Stock Purchase
Right for each outstanding share of Common Stock of the Corporation
to stockholders of record at the close of business on January 2,
1990.  Each Right entitles the registered holder to purchase from
the Corporation one share of Common Stock, par value $2 per share
(the Common Stock ), at a cash Exercise Price of $36 per share of
Common Stock, subject to adjustment.

The Purchase Rights will be exercisable for shares of common stock
having a market value of two times the exercise price in the event
that the Board of Directors determines that the Corporation may be
the subject of an adverse takeover.  In the event that the
Corporation is acquired in a merger in which the Corporation is not
the surviving corporation or 50 percent or more of the Corporation s
assets or earning power is sold, the Purchase Rights will be
exercisable for common stock of the acquiring corporation having a
market value of two times the exercise price.  The Purchase Rights
may be redeemed in whole by the Corporation, under certain
circumstances, at a price of $.0001 per Purchase Right.  The
Purchase Rights expire on January 2, 2000.

On January 5, 1996, the Corporation declared a dividend of $.06 per
share to common shareholders of record on January 17, 1996 payable
January 25, 1996.

15 - Employee Stock Ownership Plan

The Corporation established an Employees Stock Ownership Plan ( ESOP
). The ESOP has been funded by a $100 contribution from the
Corporation.  At December 31, 1995 and 1994, the ESOP held no shares
of the Corporation s stock.

Cash and Due from Banks and 
Federal Funds Sold

The carrying amount for cash and due from banks and for federal
funds sold approximates fair value and mature in 90 days or less.

Investment Securities

The fair value of securities except certain state and municipal
securities, is estimated based on bid prices published in financial
newspapers or bid quotations received from securities dealers.  The
fair value of certain state and mu-nicipal securities is not readily
available through market sources other than dealer quotations, so
fair value estimates are based on quoted market prices of similar
instruments, adjusted for differences between the quoted instruments
and the instruments being valued.

Loans

Fair values are estimated for portfolios of loans with similar
financial characteristics.  Loans are segregated by type such as
commercial, commercial real estate, residential mortgage, and other
consumer.  Each loan category is further segmented into fixed and
adjustable rate interest terms and by performing and non-performing
categories.

The fair value of performing loans, except residential mortgages, is
calculated by discounting scheduled cash flows through the estimated
maturity using estimated market discount rates that reflect the
credit and interest rate risk inherent in the loan.  The estimate of
maturity is based on the Corporation s historical experience with
repayments for each loan classification, modified, as required, by
an estimate of the effect of current economic and lending
conditions.  For performing residential mortgage loans, fair value
is estimated by discounting contractual cash flows adjusted for
prepayment estimates using discount rates based on secondary market
sources adjusted to reflect differences in servicing and credit
costs.

Fair value for significant non-performing loans is based on recent
external appraisals.  If appraisals are not available, estimated
cash flows are discounted using a rate commensurate with the risk
associated with the estimated cash flows.  Assumptions regarding
credit risk, cash flows, and discount rates are judgmentally
determined using available market information and specific borrower
information.

Accrued Interest Receivable, 
Interest Payable on Deposits

The carrying amount for these items approximate the fair value due
to their short-term nature.

Deposits

The fair value of deposits with no stated maturity, such as
non-interest bearing demand deposits, regular savings, and NOW
accounts, and money market and checking accounts, is equal to the
amount payable on demand.  The fair value of certificates of deposit
is based on the discounted value of contractual cash flows.  The
discount rate is estimated using the rates currently offered for
deposits of similar remaining maturities.

Borrowed Funds

The fair value of such borrowings was estimated by utilizing future
cash flows discounted using the Bank s current borrowing rate for
similar instruments.

Commitments to Extend Credit

The stated value of commitments to extend credit approximates fair
value as the current fees charged for similar commitments does not
differ significantly from quoted fees.  For fixed-rate loan
commitments, fair value also considers the difference between
current levels of interest rates and the committed rates.  Such
differences are not considered significant.
