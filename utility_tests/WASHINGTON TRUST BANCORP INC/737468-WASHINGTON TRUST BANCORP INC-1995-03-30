ITEM 1. BUSINESS
----------------
Washington Trust Bancorp, Inc.
------------------------------
Washington Trust Bancorp, Inc. (the "Corporation") is a publicly-owned,
registered bank holding company, organized in 1984 under the laws of the state
of Rhode Island, whose subsidiaries are permitted to engage in banking and other
financial services and businesses.  The Corporation conducts its business
through its wholly-owned subsidiary, The Washington Trust Company (the "Bank"),
a Rhode Island chartered commercial bank.  The deposits of the Bank are insured
by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation ("FDIC").

The Corporation was formed in 1984 under a plan of reorganization in which
outstanding common shares of The Washington Trust Company were exchanged for
common shares of Washington Trust Bancorp, Inc.  At December 31, 1994 the
Corporation had total consolidated assets of $516 million, deposits of $441
million and equity capital of $46 million.

The Washington Trust Company
----------------------------
The Washington Trust Company was originally chartered in 1800 as the Washington
Bank and is the oldest banking institution headquartered in its market area.
Its current corporate charter dates to 1902.  See "Market Area and Competition"
below for further information.


A broad range of financial services are provided by the Bank, including:

- Residential mortgages            - Commercial and consumer demand deposits
- Commercial loans                 - Savings, NOW and money market deposits
- Construction loans               - Certificates of deposit
- Installment loans                - Retirement accounts
- Home equity lines of credit      - Electronic funds transfer
- VISA and Mastercard accounts     - Safe deposit boxes
- Merchant credit card services    - Trust and investment services


The Bank's primary source of income is net interest income, the difference
between interest earned on interest-earning assets and interest paid on
interest-bearing deposits and other borrowed funds.  Sources of noninterest
income include fees for management of customer investment portfolios, trusts and
estates, service charges on deposit accounts, merchant processing fees and other
banking-related fees.  Noninterest expenses include the provision for loan
losses, salaries and employee benefits, occupancy, equipment, office supplies
deposit taxes and assessments, foreclosed property costs and other
administrative expenses.

Automated teller machines (ATM's) are located at each of the Bank's six banking
offices.  The Bank is a member of the NYCE, Yankee 24, Plus, and Cashstream
ATM networks.


                                      -3-
Data processing for most of the Bank's deposit and loan accounts and other
applications is conducted internally using owned equipment.  Application
software is primarily obtained through purchase or licensing agreements.

The Bank's Trust and Investment Department provides fiduciary services as
trustee under wills and trust agreements; as executor or administrator of
estates; as a provider of agency and custodial investment services to
individuals and institutions; and as a trustee for employee benefit plans.  The
market value of total trust assets amounted to $389 million as of December 31,
1994.

The following is a summary of the relative amounts of income producing functions
as a percentage of gross operating income during the past five years:

                                       ====   ====   ====   ====   ====
</TABLE>

The percentage of gross income derived from interest and fees on loans was 72%
and 71% in 1994 and 1993, respectively, down from a five-year high of 85% in
1990, primarily as a result of the low interest rate environment that existed in
1993 and 1994.

Market Area and Competition
---------------------------
The Bank's market area includes most of southern Rhode Island (Washington
County) and a portion of New London County in southeastern Connecticut.  The
Bank's six banking offices are located in the following Rhode Island
communities:

   - Westerly (2)       - Charlestown       - New Shoreham (Block Island)
   - Richmond           - Narragansett


The Bank's offices in Charlestown and on Block Island are the only bank
facilities in those communities.  The Block Island office was acquired from
another Rhode Island bank in 1984.  The Charlestown office was opened in 1988
and the Narragansett office was opened in 1989.

The Bank faces strong competition from branches of major Rhode Island and
regional commercial banks, local branches of certain Connecticut banks, as well
as various credit unions, savings institutions and, to some extent, finance

                                      -4-
companies.  The principal methods of competition are through interest rates,
financing terms and other customer conveniences.  The Washington Trust Company
had 36% of total deposits reported by financial institutions for banking offices
within its market area as of June 30, 1994.  The two closest competitors held
16% each, and the third closest competitor held 6% of total deposits in the
market area.  The Corporation believes that being the largest commercial banking
institution headquartered within the market area provides a competitive
advantage over other financial institutions.  The Bank has a marketing
department which is responsible for the review of existing products and services
and the development of new products and services.

Employees
---------
As of December 31, 1994 the Corporation employed approximately 241 full-time and
53 part-time employees.  Management believes that its employee relations are
good.

Supervision and Regulation
--------------------------
General -  The business in which the Corporation and the Bank are engaged is
subject to extensive supervision, regulation, and examination by various bank
regulatory authorities and other agencies of federal and state government.  The
supervisory and regulatory activities of these parties are often intended
primarily for the protection of customers or are aimed at carrying out broad
public policy goals that may not be directly related to the financial services
provided by the Corporation and the Bank, nor intended for the protection of the
Corporation's shareholders.  Proposals to change regulations and laws which
affect the banking industry are frequently raised at the federal and state
level.  The potential impact on the Corporation of any future revisions to the
supervisory or regulatory structure cannot be determined.

The Corporation and the Bank are required by various authorities to file
extensive periodic reports of financial and other information and such other
reports as the regulatory and supervisory authorities may require.  The
Corporation is also subject to the reporting and other requirements of the
Securities Exchange Act of 1934.

The Corporation is a bank holding company registered under the Bank Holding
Company Act of 1956, as amended (the "BHC Act").  As a bank holding company, the
activities of the Corporation are regulated by the Board of Governors of the
Federal Reserve System (the "Federal Reserve Board").  The BHC Act requires that
the Corporation obtain prior approval of the Federal Reserve Board to acquire
control over a bank or certain nonbank entities and restricts the activities of
the Corporation to those closely related to banking.  Federal law also regulates
transactions between the Corporation and the Bank, including loans or extensions
of credit. 

The Bank is subject to the supervision of, and examination by, the FDIC.  As
a state chartered institution, The Washington Trust Company is also subject
to various Rhode Island business and banking regulations.

Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation Improvement Act of 1991 (FDICIA) - FDICIA
was enacted in December 1991 and has resulted in extensive changes to the
federal banking laws.  Among other things, FDICIA requires the federal banking
regulators to take prompt corrective action with respect to depository
                                    -5-

institutions that do not meet minimum capital requirements.

FDICIA established five capital tiers, ranging from "well-capitalized" to
"critically undercapitalized."  A depository institution is well-capitalized
if it significantly exceeds the minimum level required by regulation for each
relevant capital measure.  Under FDICIA, an institution that is not well-
capitalized is generally prohibited from accepting brokered deposits and
offering interest rates on deposits higher than the prevailing rate in its
market.  In addition, "pass through" deposit insurance coverage may not be
available for certain employee benefit accounts.  At December 31, 1994, the
Bank's capital ratios placed it in the well-capitalized category.

Another primary purpose of FDICIA was to recapitalize the Bank Insurance Fund
(BIF).  The FDIC adopted a risk-related premium system for the assessment
period beginning January 1, 1993.  Under this new system, each institution's
assessment rate is based on its capital ratios in combination with a
supervisory evaluation of the risk the institution poses to the BIF.  Banks
deemed to be well-capitalized and who pose the lowest risk to the BIF will
pay the lowest assessment rates, while undercapitalized banks, who present
the highest risk, will pay the highest rates.

FDICIA contains other significant provisions that require the federal banking
regulators to establish standards for safety and soundness for depository
institutions and their holding companies in three areas: (i) operational and
managerial; (ii) asset quality, earnings and stock valuation; and (iii)
management compensation.  The legislation also requires that risk-based capital
requirements contain provisions for interest rate risk, credit risk and risks of
nontraditional activities.  FDICIA also imposes expanded accounting and audit
reporting requirements for depository institutions.  In addition, FDICIA imposes
numerous restrictions on state-chartered banks, including those which generally
limit investments and activities to those permitted to national banks, and
contains several consumer banking law provisions.

The provisions of FDICIA are being phased in over several years.  While final
rules have been issued on most provisions, others have yet to be issued.

Riegle-Neal Interstate Banking and Branching Efficiency Act of 1994 - On
September 30, 1994, the Riegle-Neal Interstate Banking and Branching Efficiency
Act of 1994 was signed into law.  Effective one year after enactment, adequately
capitalized bank holding companies will be permitted to acquire banks in any
state subject to certain concentration limits and other conditions.  Also, on a
phased-in basis over three years from the date of its enactment, other
limitations on interstate bank mergers, consolidations and branching will be
eased, subject to a state's ability to "opt out" of certain provisions of the
law by passage of state law.  No legislation has been introduced in Rhode Island
for the 1995 legislative session that would constitute an "opt out" election by
the State.

Dividend Restrictions -The Corporation's revenues consist of cash dividends paid
to it by the Bank.  Such payments are restricted pursuant to various state and
federal regulatory limitations.  Reference is made to Note 16 to the
Corporation's Consolidated Financial Statements included in its 1994 Annual
Report to Shareholders incorporated herein by reference for additional
discussion of the Corporation's ability to pay dividends.
                                      -6-

Capital Guidelines - Regulatory guidelines have been established that require
bank holding companies and banks to maintain minimum ratios of capital to risk-
adjusted assets.  Banks are required to have minimum core capital (Tier 1) of 4%
and total risk-adjusted capital (Tier 1 and Tier 2) of 8%.  For the Corporation,
Tier 1 capital is essentially equal to shareholders' equity excluding the net
unrealized gain on securities available for sale.  Tier 2 capital consists of a
portion of the reserve for possible loan losses (limited to 1.25% of total risk-
weighted assets).  As of December 31, 1994, net risk-weighted assets amounted to
$342.5 million, the Tier 1 capital ratio was 12.55% and the total risk-based
capital ratio was approximately 13.82%.

The Tier 1 leverage ratio is defined as Tier 1 capital (as defined under the
risk-based capital guidelines) divided by average assets (net of intangible
assets and excluding the effects of accounting for securities available for sale
under SFAS No. 115).  The minimum leverage ratio is 3% for banking organizations
that do not anticipate significant growth and that have well-diversified risk
(including no undue interest rate risk), excellent asset quality, high
liquidity and strong earnings.  Other banking organizations are expected to have
ratios of at least 4 - 5%, depending on their particular condition and growth
plans.  Higher capital ratios could be required if warranted by the particular
circumstances or risk profile of a given banking organization.  The
Corporation's Tier 1 leverage ratio was 8.45% as of December 31, 1994.  The
Federal Reserve has not advised the Corporation of any specific minimum Tier 1
leverage capital ratio applicable to it.


GUIDE 3 STATISTICAL DISCLOSURES
-------------------------------
The following tables contain additional consolidated statistical data about the
Corporation and its subsidiary.

I.  Distribution of Assets, Liabilities and Shareholders' Equity;
    Interest Rates and Interest Differential
    -------------------------------------------------------------
  A. Average balance sheets are presented on page 28 of the Corporation's 1994
     Annual Report to Shareholders under the caption "Average Balances/Net
     Interest Margin (Fully Taxable Equivalent Basis)", and are incorporated
     herein by reference.  Nonaccrual loans are included in average loan
     balances.  Average balances are based upon daily averages.

  B. An analysis of net interest earnings, including interest earned and paid,
     average yields and costs, and net yield on interest-earning assets is
     presented on page 28 of the Corporation's 1994 Annual Report to
     Shareholders under the caption "Average Balances/Net Interest Margin (Fully
     Taxable Equivalent Basis)", and is incorporated herein by reference.

     Interest income is reported on the fully taxable-equivalent basis.  Tax
     exempt income is converted to a fully taxable equivalent basis by assuming
     a 34% marginal federal income tax rate adjusted for applicable state income
     taxes net of the related federal tax benefit.  For dividends on corporate
     stocks, the 70% federal dividends received deduction is also used in the
     calculation of tax equivalency.  Interest on nonaccrual loans is included
     in the analysis of net interest earnings to the extent that such interest
     income has been recognized in the Consolidated Statements of Income.  See
     Guide 3 Item III.C.1.

 
                                      -7-
  C. An analysis of rate/volume changes in interest income and interest expense
     is presented on page 29 of the Corporation's 1994 Annual Report to
     Shareholders under the caption "Volume/Rate Analysis - Interest Income and
     Expense (Fully Taxable Equivalent Basis)", and is incorporated herein by
     reference.  The net change attributable to both volume and rate has been
     allocated proportionately.

    The December 31, 1992 balance of mortgage-backed securities includes
    $19,209,775 of securitized mortgages originated by the Bank which were
    previously classified as loans in the Corporation's 1992 consolidated
    financial statements.

    The carrying amounts of securities available for sale as of the dates
    indicated are summarized in the table below.  Effective January 1, 1994, the
    Corporation adopted Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 115,
    "Accounting for Certain Investments in Debt and Equity Securities" (SFAS No.
    115).  The Statement requires that securities available for sale be reported
    at fair value, with any unrealized gains and losses excluded from earnings
    and reported as a separate component of shareholders' equity, net of tax,
    until realized.  Therefore, the carrying value of securities available for
    sale at December 31, 1994 presented below is equal to market value.  Prior
    to the adoption of SFAS No. 115, securities available for sale were carried
    at the lower of aggregate cost, adjusted for amortization of premium or
    accretion of discount in the case of debt securities, or market value.

    Analysis of Financial Statements on pages 25-27 of the Corporation's 1994
    Annual Report to Shareholders incorporated herein by reference.  Included
    therein is a discussion of the Corporation's credit review and collection
    practices.  Also included therein is information concerning property
    acquired through foreclosure and in-substance foreclosures held at December

  1. Nonaccrual, Past Due and Restructured Loans.
     (a). Nonaccrual loans as of the dates indicated were as follows:

                    =========   ==========   ==========   ==========  ==========
</TABLE>


     For years 1994, 1993 and 1992, loans, with the exception of credit card
     loans, were placed on nonaccrual status and interest recognition was
     suspended when such loans were 90 days or more overdue with respect to
     principal and/or interest.  Interest previously accrued, but not
     collected on such loans was reversed against current period income. 
     Cash receipts on nonaccrual loans were recorded as interest income, or
     as a reduction of principal if full collection of the loan was doubtful
     or if impairment of the collateral was identified.  Loans were removed
     from nonaccrual status when they had been current as to principal and
     interest for a period of time, the borrower had demonstrated an ability
     to comply with repayment terms, and when, in management's opinion, the
     loans were considered to be fully collectible.

     In years prior to 1992, commercial loans were placed on nonaccrual status
     and interest recognition was suspended when they were 90 days or more
     overdue.  Residential mortgages and consumer loans were placed on
     nonaccrual status when, in management's judgment, the probability of
     collection was deemed insufficient to warrant further income recognition.

     For the year ended December 31, 1994, the gross interest income that would
     have been recognized if loans on nonaccrual status had been current in
     accordance with their original terms was approximately $628,000.  Interest
     recognized on these loans amounted to approximately $287,000.

     There were no significant commitments to lend additional funds to borrowers
     whose loans were on nonaccrual status at December 31, 1994.


     (b). Loans contractually past due 90 days or more and still accruing for
     the dates indicated were as follows:

     Restructured accruing loans include those for which concessions, such as
     reduction of interest rates other than normal market rate adjustments or
     deferral of principal or interest payments, have been granted due to a
     borrower's financial condition.  Interest on restructured loans is accrued
     at the reduced rate.  Loans restructured during 1994 amounted to $525,809,
     of which $160,985 is included in nonaccrual loans reported in Section
     III.C.1.(a) above.


  2. Potential Problem Loans.
     Potential problem loans consist of certain accruing commercial loans that
     were less than 90 days past due at December 31, 1994, including certain
     loans classified as either substandard, doubtful or loss by the Bank's
     primary regulator during their most recent examination conducted during the
     fourth quarter of 1994 and loans identified by management of the Bank as
     potential problem loans.   Such loans are characterized by weaknesses in
     the financial condition of borrowers or collateral deficiencies.  Based on
     historical experience, the credit quality of some of these loans may
     improve as a result of collection efforts, while the credit quality of
     other loans may deteriorate, resulting in some amount of losses.  These
     loans are not included in the analysis of nonaccrual, past due and
     restructured loans in III.C.1 above.

     At December 31, 1994, potential problem loans which were contractually
     current amounted to $4.9 million.  In addition, potential problem loans
     that were 30-89 days past due amounted to approximately $2.3 million at
     December 31, 1994.  The Corporation's loan policy provides guidelines for
     the review of such loans in order to facilitate collection.

     Depending on future events, the potential problem loans referred to above,
     and others not currently identified, could be classified as nonperforming
     in the future.

  3. Foreign Outstandings.     None

  4. Loan Concentrations.   The Corporation has no concentration of loans which
     exceed 10% of its total loans except as disclosed by types of loan in
     Section III.A.


 D. Other Interest-Bearing Assets:    None

IV. SUMMARY OF LOAN LOSS EXPERIENCE
    -------------------------------
A. The reserve for possible loan losses is available for future credit losses
   inherent in the loan portfolio.  The level of the reserve is based on
   management's ongoing review of the growth and composition of the loan
   portfolio, net charge-off experience, current and expected economic 
   conditions, and other pertinent factors.  Loans (or portions thereof)
   deemed to be uncollectible are charged against the reserve and recoveries
   of amounts previously charged off are added to the reserve.  Loss
   provisions charged to earnings are added to the reserve to bring it to
   the desired level.  Loss experience on loans is presented in the
   following table for the years indicated.

   (1)  Beginning with 1991, the Corporation's practice for allocating loss exposure was refined,
        resulting in a broader allocation of the overall reserve.  Accordingly, portions of the
        unallocated reserve have been redistributed to specific loan categories.

ITEM 2. PROPERTIES
------------------
As of December 31, 1994 the Corporation was operating six facilities including
its main office located in Westerly, Rhode Island and five branch banking
facilities located in Westerly, Charlestown, Narragansett, Richmond and Block
Island, Rhode Island.  All sites are owned, except for the Block Island branch
facility, which is leased.  The main office premises, containing the corporate
offices and a banking facility, consists of a five story building and an
adjacent two story building.  The buildings, which are connected, contain
approximately 50,000 square feet of space, 42,000 square feet of which is
occupied by the Corporation.  The remaining space is leased to merchant and
professional tenants under short-term lease arrangements and could be used for
expansion of the Corporation's offices.  The main office location also contains
a three level retail parking garage with 80,000 square feet of space.

The Corporation has made a substantial investment in its branch office
facilities.  The Charlestown banking office opened in 1988 in a newly
constructed facility.  The Narragansett banking office began operations in June
1989 in a building which had been acquired in 1988 and was completely renovated.
A major renovation and expansion of the Richmond banking office was completed in
January of 1990.  The Richmond site also contains a separate building operated
as a restaurant by a restaurant chain under a long-term lease.


ITEM 3. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS
-------------------------
Neither the Corporation nor its subsidiary is a party to any material pending
legal proceedings, other than routine litigation incidental to their business
activities.


ITEM 4. SUBMISSION OF MATTERS TO A VOTE OF SECURITY HOLDERS
-----------------------------------------------------------
No matters were submitted to a vote of security holders during the fourth
quarter of the year ended December 31, 1994.

Combination was approved by the Board of Directors of the Corporation
by the affirmative vote of at least 80% of the Board of Directors of
the Corporation either (i) at a time prior to the acquisition of 10% or
more of the outstanding Voting Shares of the Corporation by a Related
Person, or (ii) after such acquisition, but only so long as such
Related Person sought and obtained the approval, by the affirmative
vote of at least 80% of the Board of Directors of the Corporation, of
the acquisition of 10% or more of the outstanding Voting Shares prior
to such acquisition being consummated.

     (b)  Approval by Continuing Directors and Additional Requirements.
Such Business Combination (i) shall be approved at a meeting of the
Board of Directors by the affirmative vote of 80% of the Continuing
Directors and a majority of the Board of Directors, and (ii) all of the
conditions hereinafter set forth in subsection (1) through (5) below

          (1)  The ratio of (i) the aggregate amount of the cash and
     the fair market value of other consideration to be received per
     share of Common Stock in such Business Combination by holders of
     Common Stock other than the Related Person involved in such
     Business Combination, to (ii) the market price per share of the
     Common Stock immediately prior to the announcement of the proposed
     Business Combination, is at least as great as the ratio of (x) the
     highest per share price (including brokerage commissions, transfer
     taxes and soliciting dealers' fees) which such Related Person has
     theretofore paid in acquiring any Common Stock prior to such
     Business Combination, to (y) the market price per share of Common
     Stock immediately prior to the initial acquisition by such Related
     Person of any shares of Common Stock; and

          (2)  The aggregate amount of the cash and the fair market
     value of other consideration to be received per share of Common
     Stock in such Business Combination by holders of Common Stock,
     other than the Related Person involved in such Business
     Combination, (i) is not less than the highest per share price
     (including brokerage commissions, transfer taxes and soliciting
     dealers' fees) paid by such Related Person in acquiring any of its
     holdings of Common Stock, (ii) is not less than the earnings per
     share of Common Stock for the four full consecutive fiscal
     quarters of the Corporation immediately preceding the Date of
     Determination of such Business Combination multiplied by the then
     price-earnings multiple (if any) of such Related Person as
     customarily computed and reported in the financial community;
     provided, that for the purposes of this clause (ii), if more than
     one Person constitutes the Related Person involved in the Business
     Combination, the price-earnings multiple (if any) of the Person
     having the highest price-earnings multiple shall be used for the
     computation in this clause (ii), and (iii) is not less than the
     book value of a share of the Common Stock, as reflected in the
     balance sheet of the Corporation as of the last day of the last
     fiscal quarter of the Corporation preceding the Date of
     Determination; and

          (3)  The consideration (if any) to be received in such
     Business Combination by holders of Common Stock other than the
     Related Person involved shall, to the extent that a stockholder
     agrees otherwise as to all or part of the shares which he or she
     owns, be in the same form and of the same kind as the
     consideration paid by the Related Person in acquiring Common Stock
     already owned by it; and

          (4) After such Related Person became a Related Person and
     prior to the consummation of such Business Combination: (i) such
     Related Person shall have taken steps to insure that the Board of
     Directors of the Corporation included at all times representation
     by Continuing Directors proportionate to the ratio that the number
     of Voting Shares of the Corporation from time to time owned by
     stockholders who are not Related Persons bears to all Voting
     Shares of the Corporation outstanding at the time in question
     (with a Continuing Director to occupy any resulting fractional
     position among the directors); (ii) such Related Person shall not
     have acquired from the Corporation, directly or indirectly, any
     shares of the Corporation (except (x) upon conversion of
     convertible securities acquired by it prior to becoming a Related
     Person or (y) as a result of a pro rata stock dividend, stock
     split or division of shares or (z) in a transaction consummated
     after this Article SIXTH was added to these Articles of
     Incorporation and which satisfied all applicable requirements of
     this Article SIXTH; (iii) such Related Person shall not have
     acquired any additional Voting Shares of the Corporation or
     securities convertible into or exchangeable for Voting Shares
     except as a part of the transaction which resulted in such Related
     Person's becoming a Related Person; and (iv) such Related Person
     shall not have (x) received the benefit, directly or indirectly
     (except proportionately as a stockholder), of any loans, advances,
     guarantees, pledges or other financial assistance or tax credits
     provided by the Corporation or any Subsidiary, or (y) made any
     major change in the Corporation's business or equity capital
     structure or entered into any contract, arrangement or
     understanding with the Corporation except any such change,
     contract, arrangement or understanding as may have been approved
     by the favorable vote of not less than 80% of the Continuing
     Directors and a majority of the Board of Directors of the
     Corporation; and

          (5) A proxy statement complying with the requirements of the
     Securities Exchange Act of 1934 shall have been mailed to all
     holders of Voting Shares for the purpose of soliciting stockholder
     approval of such Business Combination.  Such proxy statement shall
     contain at the front thereof, in a prominent place, any
     recommendations as to the advisability (or inadvisability) of the
     Business Combination which the Continuing Directors, or any of
     them, may have furnished in writing and, if deemed advisable by
     two-thirds of the Continuing Directors, an opinion of a reputable
     investment banking firm as to the fairness (or lack of fairness)
     of the terms of such Business Combination from the point of view
     of the holders of Voting Shares other than any Related Person
     (such investment banking firm to be selected by two-thirds of the
     Continuing Directors, to be furnished with all information it
     reasonably requests, and to be paid by the Corporation a
     reasonable fee for its services upon receipt by the Corporation of
     such opinion).

     For purposes of Sections (b)(1) and (2) hereof, in the event of a
Business Combination upon consummation of which the Corporation would
be the surviving corporation or company or would continue to exist
(unless it is provided, contemplated or intended that as part of such
Business Combination or within one year after consummation thereof a
plan of liquidation or dissolution of the Corporation will be
effected), the term "other consideration to be received" shall include
(without limitation) Common Stock retained by stockholders of the
Corporation other than Related Persons who are parties to such Business
Combination.

     (c)  Approval by Stockholders.  If there is not full compliance
with the provisions of Section (a) or (b) of this Article, such
Business Combination shall be approved by the affirmative vote of 80%
of the outstanding Voting Shares, voting as a single class; provided
that a proxy statement complying with the requirements of the
Securities Exchange Act of 1934 shall have been mailed to all holders
of Voting Shares for the purpose of soliciting stockholder approval of
such Business Combination.  Such proxy statement shall contain at the
front thereof, in a prominent place, any recommendations as to the
advisability (or inadvisability) of the Business Combination which the
Continuing Directors, or any of them, may have furnished in writing
and, if deemed advisable by two-thirds of the Continuing Directors, an
opinion of a reputable investment banking firm as to the fairness (or
lack of fairness) of the terms of such Business Combination from the
point of view of the holders of Voting Shares other than any Related
Person (such investment banking firm to be selected by two-thirds of
the Continuing Directors, to be furnished with all information it
         reasonably requests, and to be paid a reasonable fee by the
         Corporation for its services upon receipt by the Corporation
         of such opinion).

     (d)  Evaluation of Business Combinations, etc.  In connection with
the exercise of its judgment in determining what is in the best
interest of the Corporation and its stockholders when evaluating a
Business Combination or a proposal by another Person or Persons to make
a Business Combination or a tender or exchange offer or a proposal by
another Person or Persons to make a tender or exchange offer, the Board
of Directors of the Corporation shall, in addition to considering the
adequacy of the amount to be paid in connection with any such
transaction, consider all of the following factors and any other
factors which it deems relevant: (i) the social and economic effects of
the transaction on the Corporation and its Subsidiaries, employees,
depositors, loan and other customers, creditors and other elements of
the communities in which the Corporation and its Subsidiaries operate
or are located; (ii) the business and financial condition and earnings
prospects of the acquiring Person or Persons, including, but not
limited to, debt service and other existing or likely financial
obligations of the acquiring Person or Persons, and the possible effect
of such conditions upon the Corporation and its Subsidiaries and the
other elements of the communities in which the Corporation and its
Subsidiaries operate or are located; and (iii) the competence,
experience, and integrity of the acquiring Person or Persons and its or
their management.

     (e)  Amendments to this Article SIXTH.  Notwithstanding any other
provisions of these Articles of Incorporation or the By-laws of the
Corporation (and notwithstanding the fact that some lesser percentage
may be specified by law, these Articles of Incorporation or the By-laws
of the Corporation), and in addition to such additional vote of any
Preferred Stock that may hereafter be authorized as may be required by
the provisions of any series thereof or by applicable law, this Article
SIXTH shall not be amended, altered, changed or repealed without:

of the Board of Directors, and (2) not less than 80% of the Continuing
Directors, and any such amendment, addition, alteration or repeal so
recommended shall require only the vote, if any, required under the
applicable provisions of the Rhode Island Business Corporation Law.

     (c)  Subject to applicable law, the directors shall be divided
into three (3) classes, each class to be as nearly equal in number as
possible.  The term of office of directors of the first class shall
expire at the annual meeting of stockholders to be held in 1985 and
until their respective successors are duly elected and qualified.  The
term of office of directors of the second class shall expire at the
annual meeting of stockholders to be held in 1986 and until their
respective successors are duly elected and qualified.  The term of
office of directors of the third class shall expire at the annual
meeting of stockholders to be held in 1987 and until their respective
successors are duly elected and qualified.  Subject to the foregoing,
at each annual meeting of stockholders, commencing at the annual
meeting to be held in 1985, the successors to the class of directors
whose term shall then expire shall be elected to hold office for a term
expiring at the third succeeding annual meeting and until their
successors shall be duly elected and qualified.  Any vacancies in the
Board of Directors for any reason, and any newly created directorships
resulting from any increase in the number of directors, may be filled
only by the Board of Directors, acting by vote of 80% of the directors
then in office, although less than a quorum, and any directors so
chosen shall hold office until the next election of the class for which
such directors shall have been chosen and until their respective
successors shall be duly elected and qualified.  No decrease in the
number of directors shall shorten the term of any incumbent director.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, and except as otherwise required by law,
whenever the holders of any one or more series of any Preferred Stock
that may hereafter be authorized shall have the right, voting
separately as a class, to elect one or more directors of the
Corporation, (i) the terms of the director or directors elected by such
holders shall expire at the next succeeding annual meeting of
stockholders and vacancies created with respect to any directorship of
the directors so elected may be filled in the manner specified by such
Preferred Stock, and (ii) this Article EIGHTH shall be deemed to be
construed and/or modified so as to permit the full implementation of
the terms and conditions relating to election of directors of any
series of Preferred Stock that has been or will be designated by the
Board of Directors.

     (d)  Notwithstanding any other provisions of these Articles of
Incorporation or the By-laws of the Corporation (and notwithstanding
the fact that some lesser percentage may be specified by law, these
Articles of Incorporation or the By-laws of the Corporation), any one
or more directors of the Corporation may be removed at any time, but
only for cause and only by either (1) the affirmative vote of a
majority of the Continuing Directors and a majority of the Board of
Directors or (2) the affirmative vote, at a meeting of the stockholders
called for that purpose, as to all stock held by the holders of 80% or
more of the outstanding Voting Shares, voting separately as a class.

     Notwithstanding the foregoing, and except as otherwise required by
law, whenever the holders of any one or more series of Preferred Stock
that may hereafter be authorized shall have the right, voting
separately as a class, to elect one or more directors of the
Corporation, the provisions of this Section (d) shall not apply with
respect to the director or directors elected by such holders of
Preferred Stock.

     (e)  In addition to the right of the Board of Directors of the
Corporation to make nominations for the election of directors,
nominations for the election of directors may be made by any
stockholder entitled to vote for the election of directors if that
stockholder complies with all of the provisions of this Section (e).

          (1)  Advance written notice of such proposed nomination shall
     be received by the Secretary of the Corporation not less than 14
     days nor more than 60 days prior to any meeting of the
     stockholders called for the election of directors; provided,
     however, that if fewer than 21 days' notice of the meeting is
     given to stockholders, such written notice of such proposed
     nomination shall be received by the Secretary of the Corporation
     not later than the close of the tenth day following the day on
     which notice of the meeting was mailed to stockholders.

          (2)  Each notice under Section (e)(1) shall set forth (i) the
     name, age, business address and, if known, residence address of
     each nominee proposed in such notice, (ii) the principal
     occupation or employment of each such nominee, (iii) the number of
     shares of stock of the Corporation which are Beneficially Owned by
     each such nominee, (iv) any other information reasonably requested
     by the Corporation.

          (3)  The nomination made by a stockholder may only be made in
     a meeting of the stockholders of the Corporation called for the
     election of directors at which such stockholder is present in
     person or by proxy, and can only be made by a stockholder who has
     theretofore complied with the notice provisions of Sections (e)(1)
     and (2) above.

          (4)  The chairman of the meeting may, if the facts warrant,
     determine and declare to the meeting that a nomination was not
     made in accordance with the foregoing procedures, and if he should
     so determine, he shall so declare to the meeting and the defective
     nomination shall be disregarded.

     (f)  The By-laws of the Corporation may be altered, amended or
repealed or new By-laws may be adopted by the Board of Directors at any
regular or special meeting solely upon the affirmative vote of both 80%
of the Board of Directors and a majority of the Continuing Directors.
If such vote is to be taken at any special meeting of the Board of
Directors, notice of such proposed action and the substance thereof
shall be contained in the notice of such special meeting.

     (g)  Notwithstanding any other provisions of these Articles of
Incorporation or the By-laws of the Corporation (and notwithstanding
the fact that some lesser percentage may be specified by law, these
Articles of Incorporation or the By-laws of the Corporation), and in
addition to such additional vote of any Preferred Stock that may
hereafter be authorized as may be required by the provisions of any
series thereof or by applicable law, this Article EIGHTH shall not be
amended, altered, changed or repealed without:

          (1)  The affirmative vote of 80% of the Board of Directors
     and of a majority of Continuing Directors; and

          (2)  The affirmative vote as to all stock held by the holders
     of 80% or more of the outstanding Voting Shares, voting separately
     as a class.

     (d)  Business Combination.  A "Business Combination" means:

          (1)  The sale, exchange, lease, transfer or other disposition
     to or with a Related Person or any Affiliate or Associate of such
     Related Person by the Corporation or any of its Subsidiaries (in a
     single transaction or a series of related transactions) of all or
     substantially all, or any Substantial Part, of its or their assets
     or businesses (including, without limitation, any securities
     issued by a Subsidiary);

          (2)  The purchase, exchange, lease or other acquisition by

     business of a Related Person or any Affiliate or Associate of such
     Related Person;

          (3)  Any merger or consolidation of the Corporation or any

          (4)  Any reclassification of securities, recapitalization or
     other transaction (other than a redemption in accordance with the
     terms of the security redeemed) which has the effect, directly or
     indirectly, of increasing the proportionate amount of Voting
     Shares of the Corporation or any Subsidiary thereof which are
     Beneficially Owned by a Related Person, or any partial or complete
     liquidation, spin-off, split-off or split-up of the Corporation or
     any Subsidiary thereof; provided, however, that this Section
     (d)(4) shall not relate to any transaction of the types specified

     Beneficial Ownership by a Related Person of any rights, warrants
     or options to acquire any of the foregoing or any combination of
     the foregoing Voting Shares or voting securities of a Subsidiary
     of the Corporation.

     As used in this definition, a "series of related transactions"
shall be deemed to include not only a series of transactions with the
same Related Person but also a series of separate transactions with a
Related Person or any Affiliate or Associate of such Related Person.

     Anything in this definition to the contrary notwithstanding, this
definition shall not be deemed to include any transaction of the type
set forth in Sections (d)(1) through (d)(3) above between or among any
two or more Subsidiaries of the Corporation or the Corporation and one
or more Subsidiaries of the Corporation if such transaction has been
approved by the affirmative vote of at least 80% of the Board of
Directors and a majority of the Continuing Directors on or prior to the
Date of Determination.

     (e)  Continuing Director.  A "Continuing Director" shall mean:

          (1) An individual who was designated as a member of the Board

     Combination; or

          (2)  If such an agreement as referred to in Section (f)(1)
     above is amended so as to make it less favorable to the
     Corporation and its stockholders, the date on which such amendment
     is approved by the Board of Directors of the Corporation; or

          (3)  In cases where neither Section (f)(1) or (2) above shall
     be applicable, the record date for the determination of
     stockholders of the Corporation entitled to notice of and to vote
     upon the transaction in question.

     A majority of the Continuing Directors shall have the power and
duty to determine the Date of Determination as to any transaction under
Article SIXTH or Article EIGHTH.  Any such determination shall be
conclusive and binding for all purposes in either of such Articles.

     (g)  Person.  The term "Person" shall mean any individual,
partnership, corporation, group or other entity (other than the

such partnership, syndicate, association or group shall be deemed a
"Person".

     (h)  Related Person.  "Related Person" means any Person which is

prior to the consummation of a Business Combination, or both, of 10% or
more of the Voting Shares, or any Person who is an Affiliate of the

Determination was the Beneficial Owner of 10% or more of the then
outstanding Voting Shares, but does not include any one or group of
more than one Continuing Director.

     (i)  Substantial Part.  The term "Substantial Part" as used with
reference to the assets of the Corporation, of any Subsidiary or of any
Related Person means assets having a value of more than five percent of
the total consolidated assets of the Corporation and its Subsidiaries
as of the end of the Corporation's most recent fiscal year ending prior

of directors.

     (l)  Certain Determinations with Respect to Articles SIXTH and
          EIGHTH.

     conclusive power and authority to determine, for the purposes of
     Articles SIXTH and EIGHTH, on the basis of information known to
     them: (i) the number of Voting Shares of which any Person is the
     Beneficial Owner, (ii) whether a Person is an Affiliate or

     arrangement or understanding with another as to the matters
     referred to in the definition of "Beneficial Owner" as hereinabove

     of related transactions" as hereinabove defined, (vi) any matters
     referred to in subsection (l)(2) below, and (vii) such other
     matters with respect to which a determination is required under
     Article SIXTH or EIGHTH.  Any such determination shall be final
     and binding for all purposes hereunder.

          (2) A Related Person shall be deemed to have acquired a
     Voting Share of the Corporation at the time when such Related
     Person became the Beneficial Owner thereof.  With respect to
     Voting Shares owned by Affiliates, Associates or other Persons
     whose ownership is attributed to a Related Person under the
     foregoing definition of Beneficial Owner, if the price paid by
     such Related Person for such shares is not determinable, the price
     so paid shall be deemed to be the higher of (i) the price paid
     upon acquisition thereof by the Affiliate, Associate or other
     Person or (ii) the market price of the shares in question (as
     determined by a majority of the Continuing Directors) at the time
     when the Related Person became the Beneficial Owner thereof.

     Notwithstanding any other provisions of these Articles of
Incorporation or the By-laws of the Corporation (and notwithstanding
the fact that some lesser percentage may be specified by law, these
Articles of Incorporation or By-laws of the Corporation), and in
addition to such additional vote of any Preferred Stock that may
hereafter be authorized as may be required by the provisions of any
series thereof or by applicable law, this Article NINTH shall not be
amended, altered, changed or repealed without:

          (1)  The affirmative vote of 80% of the Board of Directors
     and of a majority of Continuing Directors; and

          (2)  The affirmative vote as to all stock held by the holders
     of 80% or more of the outstanding Voting Shares, voting separately
     as a class.

     TENTH.  Amendments.

     (a)  The Corporation reserves the right at any time and from time
to time to amend, alter, change or repeal any provision contained in
these Articles of Incorporation, and other provisions authorized by the
laws of the State of Rhode Island at the time in force may be added or
inserted in these Articles of Incorporation, in the manner (i) now or
hereafter prescribed by law, and (ii) as has otherwise been provided in
Articles SIXTH, EIGHTH and NINTH of these Articles of Incorporation;
and all rights, preferences and privileges of whatsoever nature
conferred upon stockholders, directors or any other persons whomsoever
by and pursuant to these Articles of Incorporation in their present
form or as hereafter amended are granted subject to the right reserved
in this Article TENTH.

     (b)  Notwithstanding any other provisions of these Articles of
Incorporation or the By-laws of the Corporation (and notwithstanding
the fact that some lesser percentage may be specified by law, these
Articles of Incorporation or the By-laws of the Corporation), and in
addition to such additional vote of any Preferred Stock that may
hereafter be authorized as may be required by the provisions of any
series thereof or by applicable law, this Article TENTH shall not be
amended, altered, changed or repealed without the affirmative vote as
to all stock held by the holders of 80% or more of the outstanding
shares of the Corporation's capital stock entitled to vote generally in
the election of directors, voting separately as a class.

     ELEVENTH.  Limiting Director Liability.

     (a)  No director of the Corporation shall be liable to the
Corporation or to its stockholders for monetary damages for breach of
the director's duty as a director; provided, however, that this Article
ELEVENTH shall not eliminate or limit the liability of a director (i)
for any breach of the director's duty of loyalty to the Corporation or
its stockholders; ( ii) for acts or omissions not in good faith or
which involve intentional misconduct or a knowing violation of law;
(iii) the liability imposed pursuant to the provisions of R.I.G.L.
Section 7-1.1-43 (as in effect or as hereafter amended); or (iv) for
any transaction from which the director derived an improper personal
benefit unless said transaction is permitted by R.I.G.L.  Section 7-
1.1-37.1 (as in effect or as hereafter amended).  If the Rhode Island
General Laws are amended after the adoption of this Article ELEVENTH to
authorize corporate action further eliminating or limiting the personal
liability of directors, then the liability of each director of the
Corporation shall be eliminated or limited to the fullest extent
permitted by the Rhode Island General Laws, as so amended.  Neither the
amendment nor repeal of this Article ELEVENTH nor the adoption of any
provision of these Articles of Incorporation inconsistent with this
Article ELEVENTH shall eliminate or reduce the effect of this Article
ELEVENTH in respect of any matter occurring, or any cause of action,
suit or claim that, but for this Article ELEVENTH, would occur or
arise, prior to such amendment, repeal or adoption of an inconsistent
provision.

     (b)  Notwithstanding any other provisions of these Articles of
Incorporation, including Section TENTH (a), or the By-laws of the
Corporation (and notwithstanding the fact that some lesser percentage
may be specified by law, these Articles of Incorporation or the By-laws
of the Corporation), and in addition to such additional vote of any
Preferred Stock that may hereafter be authorized as may be required by
the provisions of any series thereof or by applicable law, this Article
ELEVENTH shall not be amended, altered, changed or repealed without:

          (1)  The affirmative vote of 80% of the Board of Directors
     and of a majority of Continuing Directors (as defined in Article
     NINTH of these Articles of Incorporation), and

          (2)  The affirmative vote as to all stock held by the holders
     of 80% or more of the outstanding Voting Shares (as defined in
     Article NINTH of these Articles of Incorporation), voting
     separately as a class.


     TWELFTH.  The Restated Articles of Incorporation correctly set
forth without change the corresponding provisions of the Articles of
Incorporation as heretofore restated and amended, and supersede the
original Articles of Incorporation and all amendments thereto.

     If a Participant's benefit from the Pension Plan is reduced
     as a result of either or both of the conditions described
     in the preceding paragraph, the benefit to which the
     Participant shall be entitled under the Plan shall be
     determined as follows:

           (i) The benefit actually payable to the
               Participant at his actual retirement date under
               the terms of the Pension Plan shall be calculated.

          (ii) The benefit which would have been
               payable under the terms of the Pension Plan if the
               definition of compensation under the Pension Plan
               included compensation in excess of Section
               401(a)(17) of the Code and if the limits under
               Section 415 of the Code did not apply shall be
               calculated.

         (iii) The result of step (i) shall be subtracted from the 
               result of step (ii), and the difference, if any, 
               shall be the benefit payable to the Participant.


4.02 DISTRIBUTIONS OF SUPPLEMENTAL PENSION PLAN BENEFIT

     All payments of benefits to Participants and/or their
     designated beneficiaries under this Article IV shall be
     made in the same form the Participant elects under the
     Pension Plan.


4.03 COMMENCEMENT OF PAYMENT OF SUPPLEMENTAL PENSION PLAN
     BENEFIT

     Benefits shall commence under this Article to a Participant
     as of the same date that benefits commence to the
     Participant under the Pension Plan; provided, however,
     that, in the case of a Participant required to commence
     benefit payments under the Pension Plan pursuant to Section
     401(a)(9) of the Code, benefits shall not commence under
     this Article until the Participant actually retires.

     Any reductions for the commencement of benefits prior to
     the Participant's normal retirement age under the Pension
     Plan shall also apply to the payment of benefits under this
     Article.


4.04 DEATH BENEFIT

     Upon the death of a Participant any accrued Supplemental
     Pension Plan Benefit shall be applied to provide such
     Participant's surviving spouse or beneficiary with a
     supplemental pre-retirement death benefit under the same
     terms and in the same manner as provided by the applicable
     death benefit provisions of the Pension Plan.

           SUPPLEMENTAL PROFIT SHARING PLAN BENEFITS


5.01 SUPPLEMENTAL PROFIT SHARING PLAN CONTRIBUTIONS

     (a) If Employer matching contributions under the Profit
         Sharing Plan are limited by the Profit Sharing Plan
         Restrictions, the Employer shall credit to a
         Supplemental Employer Contribution Account established
         for such Participant an amount equal to the Employer
         matching contribution which would have been made
         pursuant to the Profit Sharing Plan in the absence of
         the Profit Sharing Plan Restrictions.

         If a Participant makes tax deferred contributions under
         the Profit Sharing Plan that are limited to the dollar
         limit of Section 402(g) of the Code, the 50% and 100%
         matching contribution under this Plan will be determined
         in the same manner as for Section 4.06 of the Profit
         Sharing Plan, but assuming that the Participant's Compen-
         sation for this purpose is the lesser of

            (i) "Compensation" as defined for purposes
                of Section 2.11 of the Profit Sharing Plan, but
                without regard to the limit of Section 401(a)(17)
                of the Code, and

           (ii) The dollar limit of Section 402(g)
                of the Code for the year multiplied by 25.

     The Participant's Supplemental Employer Contribution
     Account shall be adjusted at the end of each calendar
     quarter to reflect a rate of return determined as if such
     accounts were invested at the rate of interest in effect on
     the first day of the calendar year for one year
     certificates of deposit of The Washington Trust Company or
     such other rate as may be adopted from time to time by the
     Board in its sole discretion.


5.02 DISTRIBUTIONS OF SUPPLEMENTAL PROFIT SHARING PLAN BENEFITS

     All payments of benefits to Participants and/or their
     designated beneficiaries under this Article V shall be made
     in a lump sum.


5.03 COMMENCEMENT OF PAYMENT OF SUPPLEMENTAL PROFIT SHARING PLAN
     BENEFITS

     Benefits shall commence under this Article to a Participant
     as of the same date that benefits commence to a Participant
     under the Profit Sharing Plan; provided, however, that, in
     the case of a Participant required to commence benefit
     payments under the Profit Sharing Plan pursuant to Section
     401(a)(9) of the Code, benefits shall not commence under
     this Article until the Participant actually retires.


5.04 DEATH BENEFIT

     Upon a Participant's death, any amounts set aside in his
     Supplemental Employer Contribution Account shall be
     distributed to his beneficiary or beneficiaries designated
     under the Profit Sharing Plan.

                            VESTING


6.01 VESTING

     A Participant shall be vested in his Supplemental Pension
     Plan Benefit, if any, in accordance with the vesting
     provisions of the Pension Plan.  A Participant shall be
     fully vested at all times in his Supplemental Profit
     Sharing Plan Benefit.


                          ARTICLE VII

                            FUNDING


7.01 FUNDING

     The Employer shall be under no obligation to establish a
     fund or reserve in order to pay the benefits under the
     Plan.  The Employer shall be required to make payments only
     as benefits become due and payable.  No person shall have
     any right, other than the right of an unsecured general
     creditor, against the Employer with respect to the benefits
     payable hereunder, or which may be payable hereunder, to
     any Participant, surviving spouse or beneficiary hereunder.
     Notwithstanding the foregoing, in order to pay benefits
     under this Plan the Employer may establish a grantor trust
     (hereinafter the "Trust"), within the meaning of Section
     671 of the Code as may be amended from time to time.  The
     assets in such Trust shall at all times be subject to the
     claims of the general creditors of the Employer, and
     neither the Plan nor any Participant, surviving spouse or
     beneficiary shall have any preferred claim or right, or
     any beneficial ownership interest in any such assets of the
     Trust prior to the time such assets are paid to a
     Participant as a Supplemental Pension Benefit or as a
     Supplemental Profit Sharing Plan Benefit, and all rights
     credited under this Plan and said Trust shall be mere
     unsecured contractual rights of a Participant against the
     Employer.


                          ARTICLE VIII

                         ADMINISTRATION


8.01 DUTIES OF THE PLAN ADMINISTRATOR

     The Plan shall be administered by the Plan Administrator in
     accordance with its terms and purposes.  The Plan
     Administrator shall determine the amount and manner of
     payment of the benefits due to or on behalf of each
     Participant from the Plan and shall cause them to be paid
     by the Employer accordingly.


8.02 FINALITY OF DECISIONS

     The Plan Administrator is expressly granted, without
     intending any limitation, the discretion to construe the
     terms of the Plan and to determine eligibility for benefits
     hereunder.  The decisions made by and the actions taken by
     the Plan Administrator in the administration of the Plan
     shall be final and conclusive on all persons, and neither
     the Plan Administrator nor the Employer shall be subject to
     individual liability with respect to the Plan.


                           ARTICLE IX

                         MISCELLANEOUS

     contract of employment between the Employer and any

           OUTSIDE DIRECTORS RETAINER CONTINUATION PLAN
                   AS AMENDED, DECEMBER 17, 1992



     As an element of the compensation of outside directors who
are not employees of Washington Trust Bancorp, Inc.  ("WTB") or
any WTB subsidiary, such outside directors shall receive the
following benefit after leaving service as a director:

     1.  The benefit shall be the regular quarterly retainer in
effect at the time of the director's departure from the WTB or
subsidiary Board of Directors (the "Board"), payable for a number
of years equal to the number of years (or fractions thereof) for
which the director served as a regular director of WTB or
subsidiary thereof.  The benefit will be paid quarterly to
coincide with the quarterly retainer fee payments to active
directors.

     2.  The benefit shall be payable only to outside directors
who (a) leave service as a director after the date of adoption of
this resolution, and (b) have not been removed for cause.

     3.  No benefit will be paid to a retired director who without
the consent of WTB is engaged in or affiliated with any business
entity or activity which directly or indirectly competes with WTB
or any of its subsidiaries.

     4.  For purposes of calculating the duration of a director's
service as an outside regular director of WTB under this
resolution, there shall be added to such service service as an
outside regular director of any bank subsidiary of WTB, including
service before it became a subsidiary of WTB, and any bank which
merged with such bank subsidiary before it became a subsidiary of
WTB.  Simultaneous service with WTB and a bank subsidiary shall
not be cumulated.

     5.  In the case of a director who retires or resigns from the
Board, the benefit shall be payable commencing upon the date of
the director's departure from the Board.  If a director retires or
resigns from the Bank before attaining age 65, the benefit shall
be reduced by 5% for each year or fraction thereof that the
director is less than age 65, but the benefit shall not be reduced
by more than 50%.

     6.  In the case of a director who dies in service or before
commencement of payment of the benefit, 50% of the benefit that
would have been payable to the director (with no reduction for the
director's age at death) shall be paid in quarterly payments
commencing immediately to the director's surviving spouse, if any,
for the lesser of the spouse's life or the length of the deceased
director's Board service.

     7.  In the event of a director's death after retirement but
before completion of all payments due, the remaining payments
(with the amount reduced by 50%) will be paid to the director's
surviving spouse, if any, for the lesser of the spouse's life or
the remainder of the length of the deceased director's Board
service.

     8.  Accrued and unpaid benefits under this resolution will be
an unfunded and unsecured obligation of The Washington Trust
Company.  The Board may amend, suspend or terminate this plan or
any benefits under it at any time, but no amendment, suspension or
termination shall, without the consent of a director, impair the
rights of the director in any benefits therefore accrued under the
plan.

                WASHINGTON TRUST BANCORP, INC. AND
                   THE WASHINGTON TRUST COMPANY

               PLAN FOR DEFERRAL OF DIRECTORS' FEES


PLAN for the Deferral of Directors' Fees, adopted by Washington
Trust Bancorp, Inc. and The Washington Trust Company
(collectively, "the Corporation") effective March 1, 1988, for the
purpose of permitting members of the Board of Directors of the
Corporation ("Directors") to defer receipt of all or any part of
their retainer and fees for services as a Director and as a member
of any and all committees of the Boards of Directors of the
Corporation ("Directors' fees").

     1.  Any Director of the Corporation who is now serving as
         such or is hereafter elected to membership on the Board
         of Directors, may elect to defer receipt of all or any
         part of future Director's fees, and to receive such
         deferred fees, together with interest thereon, at the
         time and in the manner hereinafter provided, subject to
         all of the provisions of this Plan.

     2.  An election to defer all or any part of Directors' fees
         shall be made by written election on a form to be
         provided by the Corporation, filed with the Secretary of
         the Corporation on or before December 31 of any year, and
         shall be effective with respect to Directors' fees earned
         for services performed during the following calendar
         year, provided that if a newly elected Director files an
         election within 60 days after becoming a Director, such
         election may be made effective with respect to fees
         earned by him for services performed in the same calendar
         year but only for calendar quarters subsequent to the
         date of filing, and provided further that for the first
         calendar year of the Plan, such election shall be
         effective for fees earned in the calendar quarter
         following the quarter such election is made.

     3.  At the time he makes his election, the Director shall
         indicate the amount of the deferral that shall apply to
         all of his Directors' fees otherwise payable, and shall
         specify the method of payment selected in accordance with
         paragraph 7.  Such election and all of the terms thereof
         shall be irrevocable with respect to Directors' fees
         earned while it is in effect.

     4.  An election to defer all or any part of Directors' fees
         shall continue in effect indefinitely from year to year
         as long as the Director continues as a Director, provided
         that the Director may terminate the election at any time
         by written notice filed with the Secretary of the
         Corporation, effective with respect to fees earned for
         services performed subsequent to such filing.  A Director
         may also change his selection of the payment date or
         method of payment by filing a revised selection with the
         Secretary of the Corporation on or before December 31 of
         any year, and such revised selection shall apply with
         respect to Directors' fees earned for services performed
         during the following calendar year, and thereafter.  No
         such method of payment shall apply to fees deferred under
         the prior election.

     5.  A Director's deferred fees shall be credited to a
         separate memorandum fee account ("Fee Account")
         maintained by the Corporation on his behalf, and interest
         shall be credited on the balance of such account
         (including interest theretofore credited) on the last day
         of each calendar month at a rate of the last day of each
         calendar month at a rate of interest equal to the rate of
         interest in effect on the first day of the calendar year
         for one year certificates of deposits of The Washington
         Trust Company.

     6.  The balance in a Director's Fee Account shall become
         payable to him on the later of (a) the first business day
         of January next following the date he ceases to be a
         Director, or (b) the first business day of January in the
         year following his 65th birthday.

     7.  When the balance in a Directors' Fee Account becomes
         payable, such balance shall be paid either (a) in one
         lump sum, (b) in a series of five approximately equal
         annual installments, or (c) in a series of ten
         approximately equal annual installments, as the Director
         shall specify at the time he makes his election to defer.
         If a Director's Fee Account is paid in installments,
         interest shall be credited on the unpaid balance of the
         account as provided in paragraph 5 hereof.

     8.  In the event a Director dies before his Fee Account has
         become payable, or before he has received the entire
         balance thereof, the amount of such Account or the
         remaining balance thereof, shall become payable on the
         first business day of January next succeeding his death,
         and shall be paid to his designated beneficiary, either
         (a) in one lump sum, or (b) in a series of approximately
         equal annual installments over a period of either five or
         ten years, with interest credited on the unpaid balance
         as provided in paragraph 5 hereof, as the Director shall
         elect.  If a designated beneficiary shall survive the
         Director and die before receiving the entire balance of
         his Fee Account, the remaining balance shall be paid to
         the estate of the beneficiary in one lump sum on the next
         succeeding first business day of January.  A Director may
         designate a beneficiary, or change or revoke a
         designation of beneficiary, at any time and from time to
         time, by a written designation filed with the Secretary
         of the Corporation.  In the event there is no designation
         of beneficiary in effect at the time of the Director's
         death, or if the last designated beneficiary shall have
         predeceased the Director, the Fee Account shall be paid
         in one sum to the executor or administrator of the estate
         of the Director.

     9.  The Corporation shall not fund its liability for deferred
         Directors' fees or interest in any way.  A Director's Fee
         Account shall be solely for the internal bookkeeping
         purposes of the Corporation, and neither the Director,
         his beneficiary nor estate shall have any interest
         therein.

    10.  In the event of the physical disability or severe
         financial hardship of a Director, the Chief Executive
         Officer of the Corporation may in his sole discretion
         make any payments from the deferred compensation account
         of such Director to him or for his account as deemed by
         such Chief Executive Officer to be in his best interests;
         the fact of disability and financial hardship to be
         determined in the sole discretion of such Chief Executive
         Officer.

    11.  This Plan is to be binding upon the Corporation and upon
         its successors and assigns.  In the event of the merger
         of the Corporation with any other corporation, the Board
         of Directors of such merged or resulting corporation
         shall be deemed to have the powers herein stated.

    12.  The purpose of the Plan is to accomplish the deferral of
         the incidence of federal income tax on a Director's
         deferred fees and the interest thereon until such time as
         the Director, his beneficiary or estate, actually
         receives payment of the same, as provided in Internal
         Revenue Service Revenue Ruling 71-419, and the Plan shall
         be construed in accordance with such purpose.

    13.  This Plan may be amended at any time and from time to
         time, or terminated in whole or in part, as to the
         Corporation by action of its Board of Directors; but no
         amendment or termination shall apply with respect to a
         Director's fees theretofore deferred except with the
         consent of the Director, unless in the opinion of legal
         counsel to the Corporation such amendment or termination
         is necessary to reflect changes in the principles of
         Revenue Ruling 71-419, or otherwise necessary or
         desirable to accomplish the purposes of this Plan.

    14.  This Plan shall be effective with respect to Directors'
         fees earned for services performed on or after April 1,
         1988.

    IN WITNESS WHEREOF, the CORPORATION has caused this Plan to be
executed and its corporate officer thereunto duly authorized and
its corporate seal to be affixed hereto this 11th day of February
1988.

an amendment and restatement of the 1988 Stock Option Plan which was
adopted by the Board of Directors of Washington Trust Bancorp, Inc.
(the "Corporation") in 1988 and by the shareholders of the Corporation
on April 4, 1988, and further amended by the Board of Directors on
April 3, 1989.  The purpose of this Plan is to encourage and enable
certain officers, employees and directors of the Corporation and any
subsidiaries to acquire an interest in the Corporation through the
granting of stock options, as herein provided, to acquire its
common stock, $.0625 par value per share (the "Common Stock").  Two
separate forms of options may be granted pursuant to this Plan:
Incentive Stock Options under the provisions of Section 422A of the
Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the "Code"); and Non-
Qualified Options.  Both forms of options are herein referred to
collectively hereunder as "options".

1. Shares of Stock Subject to the Plan
 
The stock that may be issued and sold pursuant to options granted
under the Plan shall not exceed, in the aggregate, 600,000 shares of
Common Stock, which may be (i) authorized but unissued shares, (ii)
treasury shares, or (iii) shares previously reserved for issue upon
exercise of options under the Plan, which options have expired or
terminated; provided, however, that the number of shares subject to
the Plan shall be subject to adjustment as provided in Section 7.

2. Administration
 
The Plan shall be administered, construed and interpreted by a
committee appointed by the Board of Directors of the Corporation
(hereinafter called the "Committee").  The Committee shall consist of
three or more members of the Board of Directors who are not officers
of the Corporation.  No member of the Committee shall be entitled to
participate in the Plan, except as provided in Section 14 hereof.
Subject to the provisions of the Plan, the Committee shall determine
the persons to be granted options (the "Optionees"), the number of
shares subject to each option, whether the options shall be Incentive
Stock Options or Non-Qualified Options, the price to be paid for the
shares upon the exercise of each option, and the terms and conditions
of the options.  In addition, the Committee shall adopt forms of
option agreements and make determinations under, or interpretations
of, any provision of the Plan and any option.  The Committee shall
maintain separate records with respect to Incentive Stock Options and
Non-Qualified Options granted under the Plan to facilitate the
determination of the appropriate tax treatment for such options.  Any
of the foregoing action taken by the Committee in its sole discretion
shall be final and conclusive.  Any Committee action with respect to
options granted to non-employee directors pursuant to Section 14
hereof shall be limited to ministerial, non-discretionary matters,
consistent with the terms of the Plan.
 
3. Eligibility
 
Officers (whether or not they are directors) and employees of the
Corporation shall be eligible to receive options.  A director of the
Corporation who is not a full time employee of the Corporation shall
not be eligible to receive options, except as provided in Section 14
hereof.
 
4. Price and Limitation on Grant of Options
 
(a) The purchase price of the Common Stock which may be purchased
under each option shall be at least equal to the fair market value per
share of the outstanding Common Stock of the Corporation at the time
the option is granted, as determined by the Committee.  The aggregate
fair market value (determined as of the time the option is granted) of
the Common Stock for which any person participating in the Plan may be
granted options under the Plan (or any subsequent option plan) as
Incentive Stock Options under Section 422A of the Code shall not
exceed the minimum amount (either at grant or vesting) that would be
permissible under said Section 422A and the Treasury regulations
thereunder without disqualifying such option as an Incentive Stock
Option.

(b) The purchase price of shares which may be purchased under each
Incentive Stock Option issued to a person who, immediately prior to
the grant of such option, owns (directly or indirectly) stock
possessing more than ten percent of the total combined voting power of
all classes of stock of the Corporation shall be at least equal to 110
percent of the fair market value of the Common Stock subject to the
option, as determined in Section 4(a) above.
 
(c) The option price shall be payable either (i) in United States
dollars in cash or by check, bank draft or money order payable to the
order of the Corporation, (ii) through the delivery of shares of
Common Stock of the Corporation (the "Stock") already owned by the
Optionee with a fair market value equal to the option price, or (iii)
by a combination of (i) and (ii) above.  The fair market value of
Stock so delivered shall be the mean of the high and low prices of
publicly traded shares of Common Stock of the Corporation on the date
of exercise or as otherwise may be determined by the Committee.
Unless otherwise determined by the Committee, an Optionee may engage
in a successive exchange (or series of exchanges) in which Common
Stock they are entitled to receive upon the exercise of an option may
be simultaneously utilized as payment for the exercise of an
additional option or options.
 
5. No Rights as Shareholder
 
Until receipt of the purchase price upon exercise of an option and
fulfillment of other requirements of the Plan, no Optionee or person
entitled to exercise the option shall be, or shall be deemed to be, a
holder of any shares of the Corporation subject to the option for any
purpose.

 
6. Non-Transferability of Option
 
Each option granted under the Plan shall provide that it is personal
to the Optionee, is not transferable by the Optionee in any manner
otherwise than by will or the laws of descent and distribution or a
qualified domestic relations order ("Qualified Domestic Relations
Order"), as defined by the Code or Title I of the Employee Retirement
Income Security Act, or the rules thereunder ("ERISA"), and is
exercisable, during the Optionee's lifetime, only by such Optionee.

7. Dilution or Other Adjustments
 
The terms of the options and the number of shares subject to this Plan
shall be equitably adjusted in such manner as to prevent dilution or
enlargement of option rights in the following instances:
 
(a) the declaration of a dividend payable to the holders of Common
Stock in stock of the same class;

(b) a split-up of the Common Stock or a reverse split thereof; or

(c) a recapitalization of the Corporation under which shares of one or
more different classes are distributed in exchange for or upon the
Common Stock without payment of any valuable consideration by the
holders thereof.

The terms of any such adjustment shall be conclusively determined by
the Board.

8. Shareholder Approval
 
The Plan is subject to the approval of the shareholders of the
Corporation. If such approval is not given within twelve (12) months
after the date of the Plan's adoption by the Board, the portion of the
Plan relating to the extension of the option exercise periods, as
provided in Sections 12 and 14 hereof, and the grant of options to
non-employee directors upon re-election, as provided in Section 14
hereof, shall terminate and be of no force and effect.

9. Period of Grants; Expiration; Termination
 
Options may be granted under the Plan at any time, or from time to
time, until December 31, 1997.  Each option granted under the Plan
shall expire not more than ten years from the date the option is
granted.  The Plan may be terminated at any time by the Board of
Directors of the Corporation, except with respect to any options then
outstanding under the Plan.

10. Effect of Certain Transactions
 
If the Corporation is merged into or consolidated with another
corporation under circumstances where the Corporation is not the
surviving corporation, or if the Corporation is liquidated or sells or
otherwise disposes of all or substantially all of its assets to
another corporation while unexercised options remain outstanding under
the Plan after the effective date of such merger, consolidation or
sale, as the case may be, each holder of an outstanding option shall
be entitled, upon exercise of such option, to receive in lieu of
shares of Common Stock, shares of such stock or other securities as
the holders of shares of Common Stock received pursuant to the terms
of the merger, consolidation or sale.  Notwithstanding the provisions
of any option for Common Stock which provides for its exercise in
installments, such option shall become immediately exercisable in the
event of a change in control or offer to effect a change in control.
For purposes of this Section 10, a "change in control" shall have the
same meaning as is set forth in Section 14 hereof.  The term "person"
refers to an individual or a corporation, partnership, trust,
association, joint venture, pool, syndicate, sole proprietorship,
unincorporated organization or any other form of entity not
specifically listed herein.  The decision as to whether a change in
control or offer to effect a change in control has occurred shall be
made by a majority of the Continuing Directors (as defined in the
Restated Articles of Incorporation as in effect on March 1, 1988) and
shall be conclusive and binding.

Notwithstanding Sections 9 and 15 of the Plan, this provision shall
not be amended or revoked in any manner without the affirmative vote
of 80% of the Board of Directors and a majority of the Continuing
Directors (as defined above).

11. Liability and Indemnification

No member of the Committee shall be liable for any action or
determination made in good faith, and such members shall be entitled
to indemnification and reimbursement to the fullest extent provided in
the Corporation's By-laws.

12. Termination of Employment

In the event that an Optionee's employment by the Corporation shall
terminate, any option held by such Optionee, whether granted prior to
or following the amendment and restatement of this Section 12, shall
terminate immediately, subject to the following:

If any termination of employment is due to retirement with the consent
of the Corporation, the Optionee shall have the right, subject to the
provisions of Section 5 hereof, to exercise any such option at any
time within three months, in the case of Incentive Stock Options ("ISO
Retirement Exercise Period"), and within three years (or up to five
years, upon the approval of the Committee, in any individual case), in
the case of Non-Qualified Options ("NQ Retirement Exercise Period"),
after such retirement, to the extent that he was entitled to exercise
the same immediately prior to his retirement; and

If the Optionee shall die while in the employment of the Corporation
or during the ISO Retirement Exercise Period, in the case of Incentive
Stock Options, or during the NQ Retirement Exercise Period, in the
case of Non-Qualified Options, his estate, personal representative, or
beneficiary shall have the right, subject to the provisions of Section
8 hereof, to exercise his option, at any time within three years from
the date of his death, to the extent that the Optionee was entitled to
exercise the same immediately prior to his death.
Whether any termination of employment is to be considered a retirement
with the consent of the Corporation and whether an authorized leave of
absence or absence on military or government service or for other
reasons shall constitute a termination of employment for the purposes
of the Plan, shall be determined by the Committee, which determination
shall be final and conclusive.  On a case by case basis, the Committee
may, in its sole discretion, accelerate the schedule of the time or
times when an option granted under this Plan, other than an option
granted pursuant to Section 14 hereof, may be exercised.

13. Purchase of Options

At the discretion of the Committee, an employee who has been granted
options may also be granted the right to require the Corporation to
purchase all or a portion of such options for cancellation (a "stock
appreciation right").  To the extent he exercises this right, the
Corporation shall pay him in cash and/or Common Stock the excess of
the fair market value of each share of Common Stock covered by the
options (or portion thereof purchased) on the date the election is
made over the option price.  The election shall be made by delivering
written notice thereof to the Committee.  Shares subject to the
options so purchased shall not again be available for purposes of the
Plan.

14. Options Granted to Non-Employee Directors

The provisions of this Section 14 govern the granting and terms of
options for non-employee directors. These provisions supersede all
other provisions of the Plan to the extent, and only to the extent,
such other provisions are inconsistent with this Section 14.

Each person who is initially elected or re-elected a director of the
Corporation after December 17, 1992 shall automatically be granted a
Non-Qualified Option covering 1,000 shares as of the date of his
election or re-election, as the case may be, the option price for
which shall be the fair market value of the Common Stock on such date
and the expiration of which shall be the tenth anniversary thereof.

Each option granted by this Section 14 may be exercised as follows:

(a) 25% of the shares subject to such option may be purchased on and
after the date of grant; and

(b) an additional 25% of such shares may be purchased commencing on
the first, second and third anniversaries of the date of grant.

In the event of a Change in Control of the Corporation (as hereinafter
defined), each option granted under this Section 14 will thereupon be
exercisable in full by the Optionee.

For the purposes of this Section 14, a "Change in Control of the
Corporation" shall occur if:

(i) any person, firm, corporation, organization or association of
persons or organizations acting in concert, excluding any qualified
employee benefit plan of the Corporation applicable to employees
generally of the Corporation and its controlled subsidiaries, shall
acquire securities having in the aggregate more than 20% of the
outstanding voting power of the Corporation, whether in whole or in
part by means of an offer made publicly to the holders of all or
substantially all of the outstanding shares of any one or more classes
of the voting securities of the Corporation to acquire such shares for
cash, other property or a combination thereof or whether such
acquisition was made by any other means, unless such transaction is
consented to by vote of at least a majority of the Continuing
Directors (as defined in Article NINTH of the Corporation's Restated
Articles of Incorporation); or

(ii) the Corporation transfers all or a substantial part of its
properties and assets to another person, firm, corporation,
organization or association of persons or organizations, excluding a
subsidiary controlled by the Corporation itself, unless such
transaction is consented to by vote of at least 80% of the Continuing
Directors; or

(iii) the Corporation shall consolidate or merge with or into any
person, firm, corporation, organization or association of persons or
organizations unless the Corporation or its controlled subsidiary
shall be the continuing corporation or the successor corporation and
shall not be controlled by any other person, firm or corporation,
unless such transaction is consented to by vote of at least 80% of the
Continuing Directors; or

(iv) during any period of 24 consecutive months, commencing before or
after the date of adoption of this Plan, individuals who at the
beginning of such 24-month period were directors of the Corporation
shall cease to constitute at least a majority of directors of the
Corporation's Board of Directors unless the remaining directors who
were directors at the beginning of such period and any directors who
were not directors at the beginning of such period but whose election
was approved in advance by directors representing at least a majority
of the directors then in office who were directors at the beginning of
such period, constitute a majority of the Corporation's Board of
Directors.

If the holder of an option granted pursuant to this Section 14, either
prior to or following the amendment and restatement of this Section
14, shall cease to be a director of the Corporation, he may, unless
removed for cause by the shareholders of the Corporation, in which
event his option shall terminate, thereafter exercise his option to
the extent he was entitled to exercise it on the date his service
as a director terminated, but only within three years after the date
of such termination.  In no event, however, may an option granted
pursuant to this Section 14 be exercised at a time when the option
would not be exercisable had the holder thereof remained a director of
the Corporation.

In the event of the death of a holder of an option granted pursuant to
this Section 14, either prior to or following the amendment and
restatement of this Section 14, if such holder was entitled to
exercise an option at the time of his death, then at any time or times
within three years after his death such option may be exercised, as to
all or any of the shares which he was entitled to purchase immediately
prior to his death, by his executor or administrator or the person or
persons to whom the option is transferred by will or the applicable
laws of descent and distribution or pursuant to a Qualified Domestic
Relations Order and, except as so exercised, such option will expire
at the end of such period.  In no event, however, may an option
be exercised after the expiration of the option period.

The formula set forth in this Section 14 shall not be amended more
frequently than once every six months, if at all, other than to
comport with changes in the Code or ERISA.

15. Amendment of the Plan

The Board may amend and make such changes in and additions to the Plan
as it may deem proper and in the best interest of the Corporation;
provided, however, that no such action shall adversely affect or
impair any options theretofore granted under the Plan without the
consent of the Optionee; and provided, further, that no amendment (i)
increasing the maximum number of shares which may be issued under the
Plan, except as provided in Section 7, (ii) extending the term of the
Plan or any option, (iii) changing the minimum exercise price of
options to be granted under the Plan, (iv) changing the requirement as
to eligibility for participation in the Plan, or (v) that is
"material" pursuant to the applicable rules of the Securities and
Exchange Commission, shall be adopted without the approval of the
shareholders of the Corporation.

16. Section 16 Compliance

With respect to persons subject to Section 16 of the Securities
Exchange Act of 1934, as amended ("1934 Act"), transactions under this
Plan are intended to comply with all applicable conditions of Rule
16b-3 or its successors under the 1934 Act.  To the extent any
provision of the Plan or action by the Committee fails to so comply,
it shall be deemed null and void, to the extent permitted by law and
deemed advisable by the Committee in its sole discretion.

Management's Analysis of Financial Statements
Washington Trust Bancorp, Inc. and Subsidiary


Results of Operations
Washington Trust Bancorp, Inc. and subsidiary ("Washington Trust" or "the
Corporation") recorded net income of $6.3 million for 1994, an increase of 40%
over the $4.5 million of net income excluding an accounting change for income
taxes recorded in 1993.  Fully diluted earnings per share amounted to $2.18 per
share for 1994, up from $1.58 per share earned on net income excluding the
accounting change recorded in 1993.  Net income in 1993 included a benefit of
$305,000, or $.11 per share, recorded in the first quarter as a result of the
cumulative effect of a change in accounting for income taxes.

Washington Trust's rates of return on average assets and average equity ("ROA"
and "ROE") for 1994 were 1.25% and 14.11%, respectively.  ROA and ROE for the
year ended December 31, 1993, excluding the effect of the accounting change,
amounted to .95% and 12.10%, respectively.  Equivalent amounts for 1993
including the effect of the accounting change were 1.01% and 12.92%,
respectively.  Included in the 1994 ROE calculation is average equity
attributable to the implementation of Statement of Financial Accounting
Standards No. 115, "Accounting for Certain Investments in Debt and Equity
Securities" (SFAS No. 115), of approximately $3.7 million.  Had the Corporation
adopted SFAS No. 115 in 1993, ROE in 1993 including the accounting change would
have approximated 11.33%.

The 1994 increase in earnings was primarily attributable to an increase in net
interest income, a reduction in the provision for loan losses, a reduction in
the level of nonperforming assets and an increase in noninterest income.

Net interest income rose 11.2% in 1994, primarily due to growth in average
interest-earning assets and improvement in the net interest margin.  The spread
between rates paid on deposits and yields on loans and investments rose to 4.66%
in 1994, up from 4.55% in the prior year.  The resulting increase in net
interest income was $2.3 million in 1994.

Nonperforming assets as a percentage of total assets was reduced to 2.4% at
December 31, 1994, down from 3.9% of total assets at the end of 1993.  The
provision for loan losses amounted to $1.0 million in 1994, down from $2.5
million in 1993.

Noninterest income, excluding securities transactions and loan sales, rose 11.7%
in 1994.  All categories of noninterest income were up, primarily as a result of
increased volume.  Gains on sales of securities available for sale amounted to
$684,590 in 1994.  These gains were taken in the first quarter of 1994 in
connection with a nonrecurring charitable contribution expense of approximately
$700,000 for the establishment of a charitable trust.

Noninterest expense, excluding the nonrecurring charitable contribution expense
discussed above, rose 5.9% in 1994.  Salaries and employee benefits, the largest
component of noninterest expense, rose 14.3% due to increased staffing levels
and normal salary adjustments.  Foreclosed property costs declined 73.3% due to
fewer number of properties owned and a reduction in the amount of write-downs
taken on properties.

The Corporation's efficiency ratio is defined as the ratio of noninterest
expense, excluding nonrecurring expenses, as a percentage of fully taxable
equivalent ("FTE") net interest income and noninterest income excluding
securities transactions and loan sales.  In 1994, the efficiency ratio amounted
to 63.7%, down from the comparable 1993 amount of 66.7%.


Financial Condition
Total assets rose 5.8% to $515.7 million at December 31, 1994, up from $487.3
million at the end of the prior year.  Average assets rose to $502.3 million in
1994, compared to $473.7 million in 1993, an increase of 6.0%.  The most
substantial change in the Corporation's financial condition during 1994 was a
$37.6 million, or 10.7%, increase in portfolio loans.  Net loans as a percentage
of total assets amounted to 73.9% at December 31, 1994 compared to 70.6% one
year earlier.

The largest source of funding for the loan growth was an increase in total
deposits.  Other sources of funding included advances from the Federal Home Loan
Bank, the liquidation of securities available for sale, and the liquidation of
mortgage loans held for sale.

Securities Available for Sale
The Corporation adopted SFAS No. 115 "Accounting for Certain Investments in Debt
and Equity Securities", effective January 1, 1994.  Securities designated at the
time of purchase as available for sale may be sold in response to changes in
market conditions, prepayment risk, rate fluctuations, liquidity, or capital
requirements.  SFAS No. 115 requires that securities available for sale be
reported at fair value, with any unrealized gains and losses excluded from
earnings and reported as a separate component of shareholders' equity, net of
tax, until realized.  The effect of adopting this pronouncement was an $8.2
million increase in the carrying value of these securities and a corresponding
increase in shareholders' equity (net of tax) of $4.9 million as of January 1,
1994.

During the year ended December 31, 1994, the net appreciation in the unrealized
gains on these securities fell to $4.7 million.  The decline in market value of
U.S. Treasury obligations resulted from a 250 basis point rise in the Federal
Funds and discount rates that occurred in 1994.  The net unrealized gain at
December 31, 1993 of $1.1 million was reduced to a net unrealized loss at
December 31, 1994 of $526,000.  The market value of the portfolio of corporate
stocks declined considerably during the first quarter of 1994, reflecting
general equity market conditions affected by interest rates.  This factor, along
with the realization of approximately $685,000 in gains, contributed to the $1.9
million decline in the market value of these securities in 1994.  These gains
were taken in connection with a nonrecurring charitable contribution expense for
the establishment of a charitable trust in the first quarter of 1994.  (See Note
3 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for detail of unrealized gains and
losses associated with securities available for sale.)

The Corporation's investment in U.S. Treasury obligations amounted to 67.2% of
total securities available for sale at December 31, 1994.  Because of the credit
quality inherent in these instruments and their high liquidity, these securities
can also be pledged as collateral for borrowings and other purposes.

Corporate stocks were carried at market value during 1994 and at cost during
1993.  The cost basis of these securities declined by $3.3 million during 1994
due primarily to the liquidation of auction rate preferred stocks.  The balance
of auction rate preferred stocks in the portfolio at December 31, 1994 was
$500,000, down from the prior year amount of $4.5 million.

Investment Securities
Securities designated as investment securities are held as part of the
Corporation's portfolio of long-term interest-earning assets.  These securities
are classified as long-term because the Corporation has the intent and ability
to hold them until maturity.  Investment securities amounted to 10.2% of total
assets at December 31, 1994.

Included in the investment portfolio at December 31, 1994 are mortgage-backed
securities issued by the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation and the Federal
National Mortgage Association amounting to $21.7 million, or 41.3% of total
investment securities.  At the end of 1993, mortgage-backed securities totalled
$25.4 million, or 48.4% of total investments.  At December 31, 1994,
approximately 91% of the mortgage-backed securities holdings consisted of
mortgage pass-through securities.

U.S. Treasury obligations and obligations of U.S. government-sponsored agencies
amounted to $20.4 million, or 38.9% of total investment securities at December
31, 1994.  Obligations of states and political subdivisions amounted to $10.4
million at December 31, 1994, up from $7.7 million a year earlier.

Included in investment securities are structured notes with a carrying value of
$15.0 million and a market value of $13.4 million at December 31, 1994.  The
carrying value and market value of structured notes at December 31, 1993 was
$15.0 million and $14.9 million, respectively.

Structured notes are defined as debt issues whose coupon, redemption amount
and/or stated maturity adjust with changes in interest rates or other external
indices.  All of the structured notes held by the Corporation are obligations of
U.S. government-sponsored agencies.  Approximately 80% of the carrying value of
the Corporation's structured notes at December 31, 1994 are classified as such
because they have interest rates which reset periodically based on various
external market indices.

The market value of the investment portfolio has been affected by the rise in
interest rates that occurred in 1994.  At December 31, 1994, net unrealized
losses in the portfolio totalled $3.1 million, compared to a net unrealized gain
position of $836,000 at December 31, 1993.

Loans
Total loans amounted to $390.1 million at December 31, 1994, up 10.7% from the
prior year amount of $352.5 million.  The Corporation experienced strong growth
in residential mortgages, commercial mortgages and installment loans in 1994.
All of the loan growth took place within the Corporation's regional market area.
Residential mortgage loans rose 11.1% in 1994 and accounted for 43.5% of total
loans at December 31, 1994.  Most of the growth was attributable to adjustable
rate mortgages as borrowers opted to take advantage of the initial lower rates
associated with this product.  The rate of residential mortgage originations
declined substantially during the latter part of 1994 due to higher interest
rates.  The mix between fixed rate mortgages and adjustable rate mortgages was
61% and 39%, respectively, of total residential mortgages at December 31, 1994,
compared to 64% and 36%, respectively, one year earlier.  Installment loans rose
32.7% during 1994 and amounted to $45.0 million at December 31, 1994.  The
growth in installment loans was primarily a result of a strong marketing
campaign for home equity loans.  Commercial mortgages rose 14% during 1994, due
primarily to new business relationships with customers in the Corporation's
market area.

Deposits
Total deposits at December 31, 1994 were $440.7 million, up $17.4 million, or
4.1%, from the prior year.  In response to rising interest rates in 1994,
depositors have reacted by shifting deposits into longer term accounts.
Accordingly, time deposits rose 9.0% during 1994 to $194.7 million at December
31, 1994.  Savings deposits (regular savings, NOW and money market accounts)
declined by $8.2 million.  The decrease in savings deposits is largely
attributable to a $10.2 million reduction in money market deposits formerly held
by fiduciary accounts managed by the trust department of the subsidiary bank.
These deposits were eliminated in response to a change in Federal deposit
insurance regulations which became effective at the end of 1993 and affected all
banks.  Demand deposit growth has steadily increased in the last two years.
Total demand deposits rose 21.5% during 1994 while average demand deposit
balances were up 23.1% over the prior year.

Federal Home Loan Bank Advances
Washington Trust utilizes advances from the Federal Home Loan Bank of Boston
("FHLB") as part of its overall funding strategy.  Advances may be utilized for
short-term liquidity and longer-term financing.  Total advances amounted to
$23.5 million at December 31, 1994, up from $20.5 million one year earlier.


Asset Quality
Nonperforming Assets
Washington Trust's level of nonperforming assets improved by 35.2% during 1994.
This decline in nonperforming assets is attributable to sales of foreclosed
properties and to continued efforts by the Corporation to reduce the level of
nonperforming loans. Nonperforming assets include nonaccrual loans, accruing
loans 90 days or more past due with respect to principal and/or interest, and
other real estate owned.  Nonperforming assets amounted to 2.4% of total assets
at December 31, 1994, down from 3.9% of total assets at December 31, 1993.
Nonperforming loans as a percent of total loans fell from 3.2% at the end of
1993 to 1.8% at December 31, 1994.

thousands):

Risk Elements
Washington Trust assesses the quality of its loans by performing ongoing reviews
of the loans in its portfolio to determine potential loss exposure and to assess
delinquency trends.  During this review, management gives consideration to such
factors as overall borrower relationship, delinquency trends, credit and
collateral quality, prior loss experience, current and expected economic
conditions, and other pertinent factors.  As a result of this process charge-
offs and other potential problem loans are identified and loan loss reserves are
established.

Loan Portfolio Analysis
Nonperforming loans are defined as nonaccrual loans and accruing loans more than
90 days past due with respect to principal and/or interest.  An analysis of

</TABLE>


The provision for loan losses charged to earnings for 1994 amounted to $1.0
million, down from $2.5 million recorded in 1993.  Net loan charge-offs amounted
to $821,356, compared to net charge-offs of $1.2 million in 1993.

Loans, with the exception of credit card loans, are placed on nonaccrual status
and interest recognition is suspended when such loans are 90 days or more past
due with respect to principal and/or interest.  Interest previously accrued, but
uncollected, is reversed against current period income.  Cash receipts on
nonaccrual loans are recognized as interest income, or recorded as a reduction
of principal if full collection of the loan is doubtful or if impairment of the
collateral is identified.  At December 31, 1994, nonperforming loans amounted to
approximately $7.1 million.  Approximately $3.7 million, or 52.2% of these
nonperforming loans were less than 90 days past due.

Nonaccrual loans are returned to accrual status when the obligation has
performed in accordance with the contract terms for a reasonable period of time
and the ultimate collectibility of the contractual principal and interest is no
longer doubtful.  During 1994, approximately $3.0 million of loans classified as
nonaccrual at December 31, 1993 were returned to accruing status.

Residential real estate loans include fixed rate mortgages, adjustable rate
mortgages and residential construction loans that are generally well
collateralized.  The Corporation's loss experience on residential loans
historically has been favorable.  This was true in 1994 as net charge-offs on
residential mortgages amounted to approximately $157,000.  Nonaccrual
residential real estate loans amounted to $3.0 million at December 31, 1994,
down 36.6% from the prior year.  Approximately 51.8% of nonaccrual residential
real estate loans were less than 90 days past due at December 31, 1994.
Nonaccrual residential real estate loans represented 1.8% of total residential
real estate loans at December 31, 1994.  Adjustable rate mortgages represent
approximately 53% of total nonaccrual residential real estate loans, and 39% of
total residential loans.  The Corporation considers the risk of a rising
interest rate environment in the ARM underwriting process.  It is possible,
however, that ARM delinquencies may increase due to the interest rate increases
which began in 1994.

Commercial mortgages consist primarily of loans secured by commercial properties
which generate revenue for debt service.  Nonaccrual commercial mortgages
amounted to $421,000 at December 31, 1994, down 68.1% from the prior year.
Nonaccrual commercial mortgages accounted for less than 1% of total commercial
mortgages.  Net charge-offs on commercial mortgages amounted to $307,000 in
1994, compared to net recoveries of $8,000 in 1993.

Construction and development loans totalled 3.1% of total loans at December 31,
1994, up slightly from the prior year.  These loans are made for the purpose of
constructing residential properties for sale and for commercial development.
Funds are generally advanced as the project progresses.  The distinctive risks
associated with this type of loan are that additional funds may need to be
advanced due to problems in estimating construction costs, delays in completion
of the project, and inaccurate value estimates upon completion.  The maturities
of these loans are generally short term and principal is due at completion of
the project.  There were no charge-offs of construction and development loans
during 1994 and 1993.  Recoveries relating to these loans amounted to $7,000 and
$21,000 during 1994 and 1993, respectively.

Other commercial loans consist of loans to businesses and individuals, either
unsecured or secured, with varied repayment terms.  These businesses operate in
diversified industry groups including manufacturing, tourism and other service
industries.  A substantial portion of secured loans in this category are
collateralized by real estate.  These loans represented 26.1% of total loans at
December 31, 1994.  Nonaccrual loans in this category declined 43.3% from 1993,
but totalled 37.1% of total nonperforming loans at December 31, 1994.  Net
charge-offs on other commercial loans amounted to $187,000 for 1994, down from
$678,000 for 1993.

Included in the installment loan category are fixed rate loans to individuals
for the purchase of automobiles and boats, fixed rate home equity loans,
variable rate home equity lines and credit card loans.  These loans generally
have relatively short repayment periods, favorable delinquency experience and
generate higher yields than other loan categories.  Washington Trust experienced
strong growth in installment loans during 1994, primarily as a result of growth
in home equity loans.

Restructured Loans
Loans are considered restructured when the lender has granted concessions to a
borrower due to the borrower's financial condition.  These concessions include
modifications of the terms of the debt such as reduction of the stated interest
rate other than normal market rate adjustments, extension of maturity dates, or
reduction of principal balance or accrued interest.  The decision to restructure
a loan, versus aggressively enforcing the collection of the loan, may benefit
the Corporation by increasing the ultimate probability of collection.
Nonaccrual loans which have been restructured are classified as nonaccrual until
such time as the borrower has demonstrated his ability to comply with the
modified terms.  Restructured loans that are performing in accordance with their
modified terms are included in accruing loans.

At December 31, 1994, restructured loans amounted to $525,809.  There were no
commitments to lend additional funds to borrowers whose loans had been
restructured.

Other Real Estate Owned
Other real estate owned ("OREO") is composed of properties acquired through
foreclosure and other legal means, and in-substance foreclosures ("ISFs").  A
loan is considered to be an in-substance foreclosure when the borrower has
little or no equity in the property, proceeds for repayment of the loan are
dependent upon the sale of the collateral, and the borrower has effectively
abandoned control of the property or is unable to rebuild equity in the
property.  OREO is carried at the lower of cost or fair value minus estimated
costs to sell.  A valuation allowance is maintained for potential declines in
market value, known declines in market value, and estimated selling costs.

The balance of OREO amounted to $5.3 million at December 31, 1994, down from the
corresponding 1993 amount of $7.8 million.  Sales of foreclosed properties and
payments on ISFs were greater than the rate of foreclosures in 1994.  During
1994, sales of foreclosed properties and payments on in-substance foreclosures
amounted to $3.9 million.  Washington Trust has provided financing to facilitate
the sales of many of these properties.  Financing is generally provided at
market rates with credit terms similar to those available to other borrowers.

Washington Trust has been successful in reducing the balance of OREO properties
in 1994.  The most significant reductions were made to commercial properties.
The balance of commercial OREO properties was reduced from $2.4 million at
December 31, 1993 to $752,000 at December 31, 1994.

ISFs totalled $3.9 million at December 31, 1994, or approximately 60.2% of total
OREO.  Foreclosure proceedings are generally initiated on ISF properties, but
may be delayed depending upon a borrower's legal circumstances.

In January 1995, the Corporation will implement Statement of Financial
Accounting Standards No. 114, "Accounting by Creditors for Impairment of a Loan"
(SFAS No. 114).  The effect of the implementation of this pronouncement will be
a $3.8 million balance sheet reclassification of ISFs from OREO to loans and a
reclassification of $492,000 from the OREO valuation allowance to the reserve
for possible loan losses.


Average Balances/Net Interest Margin (Fully Taxable Equivalent Basis)

The following table presents average balance and interest rate information.  Tax
exempt income is converted to a fully taxable equivalent basis by assuming a 34%
federal income tax rate adjusted for applicable state income taxes net of the
related federal tax benefit.  For dividends on corporate stocks, the 70% federal
dividends received deduction is also used in the calculation of tax equivalency.
Nonaccrual and renegotiated loans, as well as interest earned on these loans (to
the extent recognized in the Consolidated Statements of Income), are included in
amounts presented for loans.

Net Interest Income
Net interest income is the amount by which interest and fees on interest-earning
assets exceeds the interest cost of deposits and other borrowed funds.  Net
interest income is the primary source of Washington Trust's operating income.
The level of net interest income is affected by the volume of average interest-
earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities, market interest rates and other
factors.  The following discussion presents net interest income on a fully
taxable equivalent (FTE) basis by adjusting income and yields on tax-exempt
loans and investments to be comparable to taxable loans and investments.

FTE net interest income increased by $2.2 million, or 10.5%, from 1993 to 1994.
The increase was due to continued growth in interest-earning assets and a
widening spread between yields earned on assets and rates paid on deposits.
The interest rate spread widened by 11 basis points to 4.66% in 1994, while the
net interest margin (FTE net interest income as a percentage of average
interest-earning assets) increased from 4.90% in 1993 to 5.08% in 1994.  Despite
the overall increase in rates in 1994, both asset yields and rates paid on
deposits and other interest-bearing liabilities were lower in 1994 than in 1993.
Lower rates on interest-earning assets were offset by strong growth in average
earning assets as well as a more favorable mix of interest-earning assets.

FTE interest income totalled $37.2 million in 1994, up 4.6% from the 1993 amount
of $35.5 million.  The FTE yield on interest-earning assets was 8.02% in 1994,
down from 8.16% in 1993.  Average interest-earning assets increased by $28.5
million, or 6.6%, in 1994.  Despite the lower yield on the loan portfolio, loan
growth changed the mix of interest-earning assets and contributed to the
increase in net interest income.  Average total loans, generally the
Corporation's highest yielding asset category, increased by 8.7% in 1994.

The FTE rate of return on total loans was 8.41% in 1994, down from 8.68% in
1993.  The decrease primarily resulted from the effect of fixed rate mortgage
refinancings.  The yield on the residential mortgage portfolio fell to 7.93% in
1994, down 84 basis points from 1993.  Continued refinancings at lower interest
rates through the first half of 1994 led to a decrease in rates earned on the
fixed rate residential mortgage portfolio.  The average adjustable rate mortgage
("ARM") portfolio grew by $19.0 million, or 44.1%, in 1994, contributing to the
decline in rates earned on the residential mortgage portfolio because such loans
have a lower interest yield at origination than fixed rate mortgages.  The
reduction in rates earned on the residential mortgage portfolio was offset by
higher rates earned on commercial loans, which have benefitted from the increase
in interest rates, and by substantial growth in the consumer loan portfolio,
which generated the highest aggregate loan yield.

Average interest-bearing liabilities rose by $11.4 million, or 2.9%, during
1994, but declining rates paid on these liabilities reduced interest expense by
4.2% from the prior year.  The average rate paid on interest-bearing liabilities
fell from 3.61% in 1993 to 3.36% in 1994.  The mix in interest-bearing
liabilities changed during the year as well.  Average time deposits grew 4.4% in
1994, while average savings deposits were virtually unchanged from the prior
year.  However, savings deposits declined by $8.2 million from December 31, 1993
to the end of 1994 as rates paid on time deposits increased relative to savings
deposits.

Included in other interest-bearing liabilities are term advances from the
Federal Home Loan Bank averaging $22.3 million in 1994, up from an average of
$18.6 million in 1993.  The average rate paid on these advances was 5.74% and
5.87% in 1994 and 1993, respectively.  These advances were used for general
corporate funding purposes.

Average demand deposits, an interest-free source of funding, increased by $9.2
million, or 23.1%, from 1993 to 1994.  This contributed to the increase in net
interest margin in 1994.


Interest Rate Sensitivity and Liquidity
The Corporation's Asset/Liability Committee ("ALCO") is responsible for
establishing policy guidelines on acceptable exposure to interest rate risk.
The objective of the ALCO is to manage assets and funding sources to produce
results which are consistent with Washington Trust's liquidity, capital
adequacy, growth, risk and profitability goals.  The ALCO establishes and
monitors guidelines for proper origination and matching of assets and funding
sources, and determines asset/liability origination and pricing strategies to
meet its goals.  The ALCO meets regularly to review the economic environment and
the volume, mix and maturity of assets and liabilities, and implements
appropriate changes in strategy to manage liquidity and exposure to changes in
interest rates.

Interest rate "gap" analysis is one of the tools used by the ALCO to evaluate
the Corporation's interest rate sensitivity at a specific point in time.  Gap
analysis measures the relative amounts of interest-earning assets and interest-
bearing liabilities that reprice within a given period.  When an institution's
interest-earning assets exceed its interest-bearing liabilities maturing or
repricing within the same period (commonly referred to as a "positive gap"), the
institution can expect asset yields to increase faster than liability costs in a
rising rate environment, thereby increasing its net interest margin.
Conversely, in a rising rate environment an institution with a "negative gap"
would expect its rates paid on liabilities to rise faster than its yield on
assets, thereby reducing its net interest margin.

At December 31, 1994, the Corporation's cumulative one-year gap was a negative
$33.7 million, or 7% of earning assets.  The following table details the amounts
of interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities at December 31, 1994
that are expected to mature or reprice in each of the time periods presented.
To the extent applicable, amounts of assets and liabilities which mature or
reprice within a particular period were determined in accordance with their
contractual terms.  Fixed rate mortgages, mortgage-backed securities and
installment loans have been allocated based on expected amortization and
prepayment rates using standard industry assumptions.  Savings, NOW and money
market deposit accounts, which have no contractual term, and are subject to
immediate repricing, are presented in the under three-month category.

Gap analysis, however, does not take into account the differing impact and
timing of rate fluctuations on assets and liabilities.  Certain assets and
liabilities that have similar repricing or maturity periods may react
differently to changes in interest rates.  During 1994, rates paid on Washington
Trust's retail deposits did not increase as quickly as rates earned on assets.
This led to an increase in the net interest margin during 1994, despite the
Corporation's negative gap position at December 31, 1993.  This increase
reflects some of the limitations of gap analysis.  Consequently, the ALCO uses
other measurement techniques to supplement gap analysis in its assessment of
interest rate risk.  The ALCO reviews interest income simulations to evaluate
the potential effect of future upward or downward changes in interest rates on
net interest income.  These simulations incorporate maturity and repricing data
for earning assets and liabilities as well as other relevant assumptions which
affect outstanding balances under various interest rate scenarios.

In 1994, the Corporation supplemented its interest rate risk management
strategies with off-balance sheet transactions.  Interest rate swap agreements
with a notional principal amount of $10 million were used to convert a 23-month
fixed rate deposit product to a variable rate.  The effect of this swap on net
interest income for 1994 was not material.  Washington Trust may utilize
additional interest rate exchange agreements as a component of its overall
asset/liability management strategy.

Liquidity is the ability of a financial institution to meet maturing liability
obligations and customer loan demand.  Washington Trust monitors its liquidity
to ensure that anticipated funding needs will be met.  Washington Trust's
primary source of liquidity is customer deposits.  Customer deposits (time,
savings, and demand deposits) funded approximately 85.6% of total average assets
in 1994.  Other sources of funding include loan repayments and discretionary use
of purchased liabilities.  These purchased liabilities include federal funds
purchased, securities sold under agreements to repurchase and Federal Home Loan
Bank term advances.  In addition, investment securities designated as available
for sale may be sold in response to liquidity needs.

The ALCO establishes and monitors internal liquidity measurements to manage
liquidity exposure.  Net loans as a percentage of total assets rose to 73.9% at
December 31, 1994, compared to 70.6% at December 31, 1993.  Investment
securities and securities available for sale as a percentage of total assets
fell to 17.3% at December 31, 1994, down from 18.2% at December 31, 1993.

For the year ended December 31, 1994, net cash provided by financing activities
was $18.8 million.  Approximately $17.4 million was generated by increases in
deposits, and $3.0 million from net advances from the FHLB.  Net cash used in
investing activities was $31.8 million in 1994, the majority of which was used
to fund loan demand.  (See the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows for further
information about sources and uses of cash.)


Capital Resources
Shareholders' equity in the Corporation consists primarily of retained earnings,
as well as common stock and related paid-in capital.  The ratio of total equity
to total assets amounted to 8.9% at December 31, 1994, compared to 7.9% at
December 31, 1993.  Book value rose to $16.22 per share at December 31, 1994, up
from the year-earlier amount of $13.71 per share.

Total shareholders' equity increased by $7.3 million, or 19.0%, during 1994.
Approximately $2.8 million of this increase is attributable to the unrealized
gain on securities available for sale resulting from the adoption of SFAS No.
115.  In addition, approximately $4.2 million in capital growth resulted from
earnings retention.

The Corporation increased cash dividends declared per share by 24% in 1994 in
recognition of continued improvements in earnings and a strong capital position.
Cash dividends per share amounted to $.73 in 1994 versus $.59 in 1993.  In July
1994, the Corporation declared a 3-for-2 stock split on shares of common stock,
effected in the form of a stock dividend which was paid in August 1994.  All per
share data included in the consolidated financial statements, the related notes,
and this discussion have been restated to reflect the stock split.

Regulatory guidelines require bank holding companies and state chartered banks
to maintain minimum ratios of capital to risk-adjusted assets.  These guidelines
were established to more accurately assess the credit risk inherent in the
assets and off-balance sheet activities of financial institutions.  Each balance
sheet asset and each off-balance sheet asset is assigned a "risk-weight" in
determining the ratio of capital to risk-adjusted assets.

Banks are required to have minimum core capital (Tier 1) of 4% and total risk-
adjusted capital (Tier 1 and Tier 2) of 8%.  For Washington Trust, Tier 1
capital is essentially equal to shareholders' equity excluding the unrealized
gain on securities available for sale.  Tier 2 capital consists of a portion of
the reserve for possible loan losses (limited to 1.25% of total risk-weighted
assets).

As a supplement to the risk-based capital measure, regulatory guidelines
restrict the extent to which banking organizations can leverage their capital
base.  The Tier 1 leverage ratio is defined as Tier 1 capital (as defined under
the risk-based capital guidelines) divided by average assets (net of intangible
assets).  The minimum leverage ratio is 3% for banking organizations that do not
anticipate significant growth and that have well-diversified risk (including no
undue interest rate risk), excellent asset quality, high liquidity, and good
earnings.  Other banking organizations are expected to have ratios of at least
4-5%, depending on their particular financial condition and growth plans.
Higher capital ratios could be required if warranted by the particular
circumstances or risk profile of a given banking organization.  The
Corporation's Tier 1 leverage ratio as of December 31, 1994 was 8.45%.  The
Federal Reserve has not advised the Corporation of any specific minimum Tier 1
leverage capital ratio applicable to it.  See Note 16 to the Corporation's
Consolidated Financial Statements for additional discussion of the Corporation's
ability to pay dividends.

Noninterest Income
Noninterest income is an important source of revenue for the Corporation.  For
the year ended December 31, 1994, noninterest income, excluding securities sales
and loan sales, accounted for 14.6% of gross income.  The Corporation generates
recurring noninterest income by charging for banking related services such as
management of customer investment portfolios, trusts and estates, assessing fees
for servicing deposit accounts, servicing residential mortgages sold in the
secondary market, and processing merchant bankcard activity.

Income from trust-related services continues to be the largest component of
noninterest income.  Trust income represented 47% of noninterest income and
amounted to $3.3 million in 1994, up 11.2% from the $3.0 million reported in
1993.  This increase is primarily due to an increase in the number of accounts
under management.

Service charges on deposit accounts rose 11.4% to $1.6 million in 1994.  The
increase reflects growth in the Corporation's total deposit base, as well as
changes in the fee structures of various deposit products during the year.

Net gains on securities available for sale totalled $684,590 in 1994, up from
$345,674 reported in 1993.  These gains were taken in the first quarter of 1994
in connection with a nonrecurring contribution expense of approximately $700,000
for the establishment of a charitable trust.  (See Note 3 to the Consolidated
Financial Statements for additional information regarding this transaction.)

Losses on loan sales totalled $15,998 for the year ended December 31, 1994,
down from gains of $484,960 reported during 1993.  The decrease is attributable
to substantial reductions in originations and sales of fixed rate mortgages in
1994, as well as from interest rate increases during 1994.  Fixed rate mortgages
originated for sale amounted to $10.4 million in 1994, down 56.7% from the prior
year.  (See the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows for additional
information.)

The Corporation retains servicing rights on all residential mortgage loans sold.
The balance of serviced loans at December 31, 1994 amounted to $91.8 million,
compared to $91.3 million at December 31, 1993.

</TABLE>


Noninterest Expense
Total noninterest expense rose 9.8% to $19.7 million in 1994.  Salaries and
employee benefits accounted for the majority of the increase, rising by 14.3%
due to increased staffing levels, normal salary adjustments and higher profit
sharing and incentive plan costs.

Foreclosed property costs totalled $240,975 in 1994, down from $901,320 in 1993.
The decrease of 73.3% is primarily due to a decline in the number of properties
owned and a reduction in the amount of write-downs recorded to adjust the
carrying values of the properties owned to their fair value.  The provision for
valuation of other real estate owned amounted to $407,530 in 1994, down from the
prior year amount of $1,042,428.

Charitable contributions amounted to $699,896 in 1994, up from $6,894 in 1993.
This nonrecurring expense is associated with the donation of equity securities
for the establishment of a charitable trust in the first quarter of 1994.  This
transaction had little effect on net income in 1994 as the expense was
substantially offset by a related gain on the disposition of the donated
securities.  (See Note 3 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional
information relating to this transaction.)

Income Taxes
Income tax expense amounted to $3.0 million and $2.3 million in 1994 and 1993,
respectively.  The Corporation's effective tax rate was 32.6% in 1994, down from
the 1993 rate of 33.5%.  These rates differed from the federal rate of 34.0% due
to the benefits of tax-exempt income and the dividends received deduction as
well as the expense resulting from state income taxes.

The Corporation adopted SFAS No. 109, "Accounting for Income Taxes", as of
January 1, 1993.  SFAS No. 109 required a change from the deferred method of
determining income tax expense to the asset and liability method.  Deferred tax
assets and liabilities are established for the future tax consequences
attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of
existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases.  The cumulative
effect of the January 1, 1993 adoption of SFAS No. 109 was a $305,000 increase
in earnings.

The Corporation had a net deferred tax asset amounting to $1.8 million at
December 31, 1994, down from $3.3 million at December 31, 1993.  The reduction
in the amount of the deferred tax asset is attributable to the implementation of
SFAS No. 115, which requires that securities available for sale be recorded at
their market value.  The deferred tax asset was increased in 1994 by
approximately $1.2 million as a result of a required change in the method of
calculating the allowable tax deduction for loan losses.  A significant portion
of the Corporation's deferred tax asset is expected to be realized for tax
purposes within a five year period.


Recent Accounting Developments
Loan Impairment
The Financial Accounting Standards Board ("FASB") has issued SFAS No. 114,
"Accounting by Creditors for Impairment of a Loan", which is effective for
fiscal years beginning after December 15, 1994.  This pronouncement establishes
accounting standards for measuring impairment on loans for which it is probable
that the creditor will be unable to collect all amounts due according to the
contractual terms of the loan agreement.  SFAS No. 114 requires impairment to be
measured on a discounted cash flow method, or at the loan's observable market
price, or at the fair value of the collateral if the loan is collateral
dependent.  This pronouncement also narrows the definition of in-substance
foreclosures.  Accordingly, many of the loans currently classified as in-
substance foreclosures will be treated as impaired loans rather than OREO under
these new guidelines.  The January 1, 1995 adoption of SFAS No. 114 will result
in an increase in net loans of $3,301,000, and a corresponding decrease in OREO.
The adoption of this pronouncement will not have a significant effect on the
Corporation's results of operations.


Comparison of 1993 with 1992
Washington Trust recorded net income, before the accounting change for income
taxes of $4,476,531, or $1.59 per share in 1993, compared to $3,150,356, or
$1.14 per share earned in 1992.  Increased net interest income, improved levels
of nonperforming assets, and a resultant decrease in the Corporation's provision
for loan losses all had a positive impact on 1993 earnings.  Net income in 1993
included a benefit of $305,000 or $.11 per share recorded as a result of a
change in accounting for income taxes.

Net interest income rose 8.8% in 1993, primarily due to a favorable interest
rate environment.  Rates paid on deposits continued to decline more rapidly than
those earned on loans and investments, resulting in a $1.7 million increase in
net interest income in 1993.  The net interest margin amounted to 4.90% in 1993,
up from 4.76% in 1992.  The interest rate spread rose 15 basis points to 4.55%
for the year ended December 31, 1993.

Total loans increased by $27.3 million in 1993 and amounted to $352.5 million at
December 31, 1993.  Commercial loan demand was soft during 1993, but demand for
fixed rate residential mortgage refinancings was strong due to low interest
rates.  The majority of the fixed rate mortgages originated in 1993 were sold in
the secondary market.  Adjustable rate residential mortgages increased $22.0
million, or 65.8%, as borrowers opted for the attractive rates that this product
offered.

Nonperforming assets totalled 3.9% of total assets at December 31, 1993, down
from the 1992 amount of 5.7%.  The Corporation's loan loss provision amounted to
$2.5 million in 1993, down from $4.0 million in 1992.  Net loan charge-offs
amounted to $1.2 million in 1993, down from $3.1 million in 1992.

Shareholders' equity rose 10.1% in 1993 to $38.5 million.  The ratio of capital
to assets was 7.9% and 7.6% at December 31, 1993 and 1992, respectively.
Dividends paid per share amounted to $.59 in 1993, up 10% from the prior year.

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements
WASHINGTON TRUST BANCORP, INC. AND SUBSIDIARY

(1) Summary of Significant Accounting Policies
Basis of Presentation
The consolidated financial statements of Washington Trust Bancorp, Inc. and
subsidiary (the Corporation) include the accounts of Washington Trust Bancorp,
Inc. and its wholly-owned subsidiary, The Washington Trust Company, a Rhode
Island chartered bank.  All significant intercompany transactions have been
eliminated.  The consolidated financial statements are presented on the accrual
basis of accounting except for certain fees earned in a fiduciary capacity which
are reported on a cash basis and which do not differ materially from amounts
determined on the accrual basis.

Certain amounts in the 1993 and 1992 consolidated financial statements have been
reclassified to conform to the current reporting format.

Securities Available for Sale
The Corporation designates securities that it intends to use as part of its
asset/liability strategy or that may be sold as a result of changes in market
conditions, changes in prepayment risk, rate fluctuations, liquidity or capital
requirements as available for sale.  The determination to classify such
securities as available for sale is made at the time of purchase.

Effective January 1, 1994, the Corporation adopted Statement of Financial
Accounting Standards No. 115, "Accounting for Certain Investments in Debt and
Equity Securities" (SFAS No. 115).  The Statement requires that securities
available for sale be reported at fair value, with any unrealized gains and
losses excluded from earnings and reported as a separate component of
shareholders' equity, net of tax, until realized.  Any decline in fair value
below the amortized cost basis of an individual security deemed to be other than
temporary is recognized as a realized loss in the accounting period in which the
determination is made.  The fair value of the security at the time of the write-
down becomes the new cost basis of the security.

Prior to adoption of SFAS No. 115, securities available for sale were carried at
the lower of aggregate cost, adjusted for amortization of premium or accretion
of discount in the case of debt securities, or market value.  The resulting net
unrealized loss, if any, was charged to current period earnings.  Any unrealized
loss on an individual security deemed to be other than temporary was recognized
as a realized loss in the accounting period in which the determination was made.

Realized gains or losses from sales of equity securities are determined using
the average cost method, while other realized gains and losses are determined
using the specific identification method.

Investment Securities
The determination to classify debt securities in the investment category is made
at the time of purchase and is based on management's intent and ability to hold
the securities until maturity.  Debt securities held in the investment portfolio
are stated at cost, adjusted for amortization of premium and accretion of
discount (calculated on a method that approximates the interest method).

Loan Accounting Policy
Mortgage Loans Held for Sale
Mortgage loans held for sale are carried at the lower of aggregate cost, net of
unamortized deferred loan origination fees and costs, or market.  Unrealized
losses, if any, are charged to current period earnings.

Loans
Loans are stated at the principal amount outstanding, net of unamortized
deferred loan origination fees and costs.  Interest income is accrued on various
methods which approximate a level yield related to principal amounts
outstanding.  Deferred loan fees and costs are amortized as an adjustment to
yield over the life of the related loans.

Nonaccrual Loans
Loans, with the exception of credit card loans, are placed on nonaccrual status
and interest recognition is suspended when such loans are 90 days or more
overdue with respect to principal and/or interest.  Interest previously accrued,
but not collected on such loans is reversed against current period income.
Subsequent cash receipts on nonaccrual loans are applied to the outstanding
principal balance of the loan, or recognized as interest income depending on
management's assessment of the ultimate collectibility of the loan.  Loans are
removed from nonaccrual status when they have been current as to principal and
interest for a period of time, the borrower has demonstrated an ability to
comply with repayment terms, and when, in management's opinion, the loans are
considered to be fully collectible.

Restructured Loans
Restructured loans include those for which concessions such as reduction of
interest rates other than normal market rate adjustments, or deferral of
principal or interest payments have been granted due to a borrower's financial
condition.  Subsequent cash receipts on restructured loans are applied to the
outstanding principal balance of the loan, or recognized as interest income
depending on management's assessment of the ultimate collectibility of the loan.

Reserve for Possible Loan Losses
The reserve for possible loan losses is available for future credit losses
inherent in the loan portfolio.  The level of the reserve is based on
management's ongoing review of the growth and composition of the loan portfolio,
net charge-off experience, current and expected economic conditions, and other
pertinent factors.  Loans (or portions thereof) deemed to be uncollectible are
charged against the reserve and recoveries of amounts previously charged off are
added to the reserve.  Loss provisions charged to earnings are added to the
reserve to bring it to the desired level.

Premises and Equipment
Premises and equipment are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation.
Depreciation for financial reporting purposes is calculated on the straight-line
method over the estimated useful lives of assets.  Expenditures for major
additions and improvements are capitalized while the costs of current
maintenance and repairs are charged to operating expenses.

Other Real Estate Owned (OREO)
Other real estate owned consists of property acquired through foreclosure, and
includes loans determined to be "in-substance" foreclosures (ISFs).  A loan is
considered to be an ISF when the borrower has little or no equity in the
underlying collateral property, proceeds for repayment of the loan are dependent
upon the sale of the collateral, and the borrower has effectively abandoned
control of the property or it is doubtful that the borrower will be able to
rebuild equity in the property.

OREO is stated at the lower of cost or fair value at the date of acquisition or
classification to ISF status.  Fair value of such assets is determined based on
independent appraisals and other relevant factors.  Any write-down to fair value
at the time of foreclosure or classification to ISF status is charged to the
reserve for possible loan losses.  A valuation allowance is maintained for
potential declines in market value, known specific declines in market value, and
estimated selling costs.  Increases to the valuation allowance, expenses
associated with ownership of these properties, and gains and losses from their
sale are included in foreclosed property costs.

Interest Rate Swap Agreements
Interest rate swap agreements are agreements to exchange interest payments (e.g.
fixed-rate for variable-rate payments) computed on contractual amounts.
Interest rate swap agreements are entered into as hedges against future interest
rate fluctuations on specifically identified assets or liabilities.  The
Corporation does not trade in speculative swaps.  Therefore, these instruments
are not marked to market.

Amounts paid or received related to outstanding contracts that are used to
manage interest rate risk are recognized in earnings as an adjustment to the
related interest income or expense over the life of the swap agreements.  Gains
or losses resulting from the termination of interest rate swap agreements on
qualifying hedges of existing assets or liabilities are deferred and amortized
over the remaining lives of the related assets/liabilities as an adjustment to
the yield.  Unamortized deferred gains/losses on terminated interest rate swap
agreements are included in the underlying assets/liabilities hedged.

Deposit Taxes and Assessments
Deposit taxes and assessments consist of amounts assessed to members of the Bank
Insurance Fund (BIF) by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) and
deposit taxes imposed by the State of Rhode Island.  These amounts are
calculated based on levels of bank deposits using rates established by the
respective regulatory authorities.

Pension Costs
Annual charges to earnings for the Corporation's defined benefit plans are
recognized based upon actuarial calculations and other methods.

Advertising and Promotion Costs
Advertising and promotion costs, including advertising production and
communication costs, are reported as an expense in the period in which they are
incurred.

Income Taxes
Income tax expense is determined based on the asset and liability method,
whereby deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax
consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement
carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax
bases.  Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates
expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary
differences are expected to be recovered or settled.

The Corporation adopted Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 109,
"Accounting for Income Taxes" (SFAS No. 109) on January 1, 1993.  The cumulative
effect of adoption of SFAS No. 109 was reported in the 1993 Consolidated
Statements of Income.  Prior to adoption of SFAS No. 109, the Corporation
accounted for income taxes under Accounting Principles Board Opinion No. 11,
whereby deferred taxes are provided for income and expense items which are
recognized in different time periods for financial reporting and tax return
purposes.

Earnings Per Share
Earnings per share is determined by dividing net income by the average number of
common shares and common stock equivalents outstanding, net of shares assumed to
be repurchased using the treasury stock method.  Common stock equivalents arise
from the assumed exercise of outstanding stock options, if dilutive.

Cash Flows
For purposes of reporting cash flows, cash and cash equivalents include cash on
hand, amounts due from banks, and federal funds sold.  Generally, federal funds
are sold on an overnight basis.

In 1993 the Corporation adopted the policy of originating certain mortgage loans
specifically for sale in the secondary market.  Accordingly, originations and
sales of such loans in 1993 and 1994 are classified as operating activities in
the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows.


(2) Cash and Due From Banks
The Corporation's bank subsidiary is required to maintain certain average
reserve balances with the Federal Reserve.  Such reserve balances amounted to
$6,856,533 and $6,249,989 at December 31, 1994 and 1993, respectively.


(3) Securities Available For Sale
As discussed in Note 1, the Corporation adopted SFAS No. 115 as of January 1,
1994.  The effect of adopting this pronouncement was an increase in the carrying
value of securities available for sale of $8,184,204.  Prior year amounts have
not been restated.

Securities available for sale are summarized as follows:

Included in proceeds from sales of corporate stocks in 1994 are proceeds of
$699,896 which represent the donation of corporate stocks to a charitable trust
established by the Corporation.  The gain on this transaction is included in
gains on sales of securities available for sale and amounted to $676,058, the
excess of the fair market value of the donated securities over their historical
cost.  The Corporation also recorded a contribution expense of $699,896 in
accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 116, "Accounting
for Contributions Received and Contributions Made".  This statement requires
contributions to be measured at the fair value of the asset given.  Prior to
1994, contribution expense was recorded in the amount of the historical cost of
donated stocks, with no gain or loss recognized.
 
Included in proceeds from sales of corporate stocks available for sale are $7.5
million and $7.0 million in 1994 and 1993, respectively, from dispositions of
dutch auction preferred stocks with no gain or loss.  Purchases of dutch auction
preferred stocks available for sale amounted to $3.5 million and $5.0 million in
1994 and 1993, respectively.  These are preferred stock instruments whose
dividend rate is reset by auction every 49 days to a market rate, resulting in a
market value of par.  At each auction, the holder can elect not to participate
in the auction and therefore liquidate its investment at par (cost).  There were
no sales of debt securities available for sale during 1994, 1993 and 1992.

Securities available for sale with a book value of $2,999,133 and $2,997,163
were pledged to secure public deposits and for other purposes at December 31,
1994 and 1993, respectively.

</TABLE>



Concentrations of Credit Risk
The Corporation's lending activities are primarily conducted in southern Rhode
Island and southeastern Connecticut.  The Corporation grants single family and
multi-family residential loans, commercial real estate loans, commercial loans,
and a variety of consumer loans.  In addition, loans are granted for the
construction of residential homes, multi-family properties, commercial real
estate properties, and for land development.  The ability and willingness of the
single family residential and consumer borrowers to honor their repayment
commitments is generally dependent on the level of overall economic activity
within the market area and real estate values.  The ability and willingness of
commercial borrowers to honor their repayment commitments is dependent on the
general economy as well as the health of the real estate economic sector in the
market area.

Nonaccrual Loans
The balance of loans on nonaccrual status as of December 31, 1994 and 1993 was
$7,119,271 and $11,370,726, respectively.  Interest income that would have been
recognized had these loans been performing at originally contracted rates was
approximately $628,000 in 1994, $1,021,000 in 1993, and $1,290,000 in 1992.
Interest income attributable to these loans included in the Consolidated
Statements of Income amounted to approximately $287,000 in 1994, $597,000 in
1993 and $709,000 in 1992.

Troubled Debt Restructurings
During 1994, $528,999 of loans were restructured.  Restructured loans which are
performing in accordance with their new terms and, therefore, not included in
nonaccrual loans, amounted to $365,000 at December 31, 1994.  Interest income
that would have been recognized had these loans been performing at originally
contracted rates was approximately $34,000 in 1994.  Interest income
attributable to these loans included in the Consolidated Statements of Income
amounted to $26,000 in 1994.  At December 31, 1994, there were no commitments to
lend additional funds to borrowers whose loans had been restructured.  There
were no accruing restructured loans at December 31, 1993.

Mortgage Servicing Activities
Mortgage loans sold to others and serviced by the Corporation on a fee basis
under various agreements amounted to $91,767,691 and $91,341,476 at December 31,
1994 and 1993, respectively.  Loans serviced for others are not included in the
Consolidated Balance Sheets.

Impaired Loans
Effective January 1, 1995, the Corporation will adopt Statements of Financial
Accounting Standards Nos. 114 and 118, "Accounting by Creditors for Impairment
of a Loan" and "Accounting by Creditors for Impairment of a Loan - Income
Recognition and Disclosures" (SFAS No. 114 and No. 118).  These statements
establish accounting standards for measuring impairment on loans for which it is
probable that the creditor will be unable to collect all amounts due according
to the contractual terms of the loan agreement.  SFAS No. 114 requires
impairment to be measured on a discounted cash flow method, or at the loan's
observable market price, or at the fair value of the collateral if the loan is
collateral dependent.  This statement also narrows the definition of in-
substance foreclosures.  Accordingly, loans currently classified as ISFs will be
treated as impaired loans rather than OREO under these new guidelines.  The
January 1, 1995 adoption of SFAS No. 114 and No. 118 will result in an increase
in gross loans of approximately $3,793,000.  The adoption of these
pronouncements will not have a significant effect on the Corporation's results
of operations.


(6) Reserve for Possible Loan Losses
The following is an analysis of the reserve for possible loan losses:

=====================================================================================
</TABLE>


Management believes that the reserve for possible loan losses is adequate.
While management uses available information to recognize losses on loans, future
additions to the reserve may be necessary based on changes in economic
conditions, particularly in the northeastern United States.  In addition,
various regulatory agencies may periodically review the Corporation's reserve
for possible loan losses.  Such agencies may require the recognition of
additions to the reserve based on their judgments about information available to
them at the time of their examination.

As stated in Note 5, the Corporation is required to adopt SFAS No. 114 and SFAS
No. 118.  The adoption of these statements on January 1, 1995 will result in an
increase in the reserve for possible loan losses of approximately $492,000 and a
corresponding decrease in the OREO valuation allowance.  This increase in the
reserve for possible loan losses is associated with loans previously accounted
for as ISFs.

(8) Financial Instruments with Off-Balance Sheet Risk and Derivative Financial
    Instruments
The Corporation is a party to financial instruments with off-balance sheet risk
in the normal course of business to meet the financing needs of its customers
and to manage the Corporation's exposure to fluctuations in interest rates.
These financial instruments include commitments to extend credit, standby
letters of credit, financial guarantees and interest rate swaps.  These
instruments involve, to varying degrees, elements of credit risk in excess of
the amount recognized in the consolidated balance sheets.  The contract or
notional amounts of these instruments reflect the extent of involvement the
Corporation has in particular classes of financial instruments.  The Corporation
uses the same credit policies in making commitments and conditional obligations
as it does for on-balance sheet instruments.  The contractual and notional
amounts of financial instruments with off-balance sheet risk are as follows:

Commitments to Extend Credit
Commitments to extend credit are agreements to lend to a customer as long as
there are no violations of any condition established in the contract.
Commitments generally have fixed expiration dates or other termination clauses
and may require payment of a fee.  Since some of the commitments are expected to
expire without being drawn upon, the total commitment amounts do not necessarily
represent future cash requirements.  Each borrower's creditworthiness is
evaluated on a case-by-case basis.  The amount of collateral obtained is based
on management's credit evaluation of the borrower.

Loans Sold With Recourse
The Corporation has retained credit risk on certain residential mortgage loans
sold with recourse.  In the event of default by the mortgagor, the Corporation
could become obligated to repurchase the loan.  Such repurchases have been
insignificant and have not resulted in any losses to the Corporation.

Standby Letters of Credit
Standby letters of credit are conditional commitments issued to guarantee the
performance of a customer to a third party.  The credit risk involved in issuing
letters of credit is essentially the same as that involved in extending loan
facilities to customers.

Interest Rate Swap Agreements
The Corporation uses interest rate swaps as part of its interest rate risk
management strategy.  Swaps are agreements in which the Corporation and another
party agree to exchange interest payments on a notional principal amount.  The
credit risk associated with swap transactions is the risk of default by the
counterparty.  To minimize this risk, the Corporation enters into swap
agreements only with creditworthy counterparties.  The notional amounts of
swap transactions do not represent amounts exchanged by the parties and, thus,
are not a measure of the Corporation's potential loss exposure.

During 1994, the Corporation entered into interest rate swap agreements with a
total notional amount of $10 million which mature in May 1996.  Under the
agreements, the Corporation pays a quarterly-resetting rate equal to 3-month
London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR) on the notional balance while receiving an
average fixed rate of 6.1% over the life of the agreements.  At December 31,
1994, the weighted average rate paid by the Corporation on the swap agreements
was 5.94%.  The purpose of the swap agreements is to convert the fixed rate paid
on certain time deposits to a quarterly-resetting rate.  The Corporation has not
terminated any interest rate swap agreements and there are no unamortized
deferred gains or losses.  At December 31, 1994, the fair value, or the cost to
terminate the agreements, was $256,000.

===========================================================================
</TABLE>


In the fourth quarter of 1992, the Corporation adopted Statement of Position
(SOP) 92-3, "Accounting for Foreclosed Assets".  This statement requires that
other real estate owned be carried at the lower of cost or fair value minus
estimated costs to sell.  A valuation allowance is maintained for known specific
and potential market declines and for estimated selling expenses.  The valuation
allowance is reduced by selling expenses incurred and increased by charges to
earnings.  Realized gains and losses on dispositions are recognized in earnings.
Prior to the adoption of SOP 92-3, the Corporation provided for estimated
selling expenses and known specific market declines as a reduction of the cost
basis of OREO, rather than through the valuation allowance.  Adoption of SOP 92-
3 resulted in increases of $798,541 to the OREO cost basis and the valuation
allowance in 1992.  Prior to the adoption of SOP 92-3, realized gains and losses
on dispositions of properties were credited or charged to the valuation
allowance.

$579,170 in 1994, 1993, and 1992, respectively.  Net realized gains on
dispositions of properties amounted to $478,519, $674,331, and $131,958 in 1994,
1993, and 1992, respectively.  These amounts are included in foreclosed property
costs on the Consolidated Statements of Income.

The January 1, 1995 adoption of SFAS No. 114 (discussed in Note 5) will result
in a decrease in net OREO of $3,301,000 and a corresponding increase in net
loans.

The Corporation's subsidiary bank is a member of the Federal Home Loan Bank of
Boston ("FHLBB").  In addition to the outstanding advances, the subsidiary bank
also has access to an unused line of credit equal to 2% of assets at December
31, 1994.  Under agreement with the FHLBB, the subsidiary bank is required to
maintain qualified collateral, free and clear of liens, pledges, or encumbrances
that, based on certain percentages of book and market values, has a value equal
to the aggregate amount of the line of credit and outstanding advances.
Qualified collateral may consist of residential mortgage loans, U.S. government
or agency securities, and amounts maintained on deposit at the FHLBB.  The
subsidiary bank maintains qualified collateral in excess of the amount required
to collateralize the line of credit and outstanding advances at December 31,
1994.


(12) Employee Benefits
Pension Plan
The Corporation's noncontributory defined benefit pension plan covers
substantially all full-time employees.  Benefits are based on an employee's
years of service and highest 3-year compensation.  The plan is funded on a
current basis, in compliance with the requirements of the Employee Retirement
Income Security Act.

Supplemental Pension Plan
Effective November 1, 1994, the Corporation established a nonqualified
retirement plan to provide supplemental retirement benefits to certain
employees, as defined in the plan.  Accrued and unpaid benefits under this plan
are an unfunded obligation of the subsidiary bank.  At December 31, 1994, the
projected benefit obligation for this plan amounted to $386,200.  The expense of
this plan amounted to $19,125 in 1994.  The actuarial assumptions used for this
supplemental plan are the same as those used for the Corporation's regular
pension plan.

Savings and Profit Sharing Plan
The Corporation has a qualified savings and profit sharing plan.  The plan
provides a specified match of employee contributions for substantially all full-
time employees.  In addition, full-time employees, excluding those key employees
participating in the Short-Term Incentive Plan, are eligible for an annual
benefit pursuant to a formula based on return on equity.  Total employer
matching contributions under this plan amounted to $173,700, $165,300, and
$81,900 in 1994, 1993, and 1992, respectively.  The amount of the profit sharing
benefit was $241,800 and $110,800 for 1994 and 1993, respectively.  There was no
profit sharing distribution during 1992.

Short-Term Incentive Plan
The Corporation's nonqualified Short-Term Incentive Plan rewards key employees
for their contributions to the Corporation's success.  This plan provides for
annual payments up to a maximum percentage of each participant's base salary,
which percentages vary among participants.  Payment amounts are based on the
achievement of target levels of return on equity and/or the achievement of
individual objectives.  Participants in this plan are not eligible to receive
benefits provided under the profit sharing component of the Savings and Profit
Sharing Plan.  The expense of the Short-Term Incentive Plan amounted to
$480,600, $462,500 and $85,700 in 1994, 1993, and 1992, respectively.

Postemployment Benefits
The Corporation adopted Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 112,
"Employers' Accounting for Postemployment Benefits", on January 1, 1994.  This
statement establishes standards of accounting for the expected cost of providing
benefits to former or inactive employees after employment but before retirement.
It requires employers to accrue for these benefits during the period in which
the employee renders service.  The Corporation provides disability-related
benefits to certain employees.  The implementation of SFAS No. 112 as of January
1, 1994 did not have a material effect on the Corporation's financial condition
or results of operations.

Directors' Retainer Continuation Plan
The Corporation has a nonqualified plan which provides retirement benefits to
non-officer directors.  The plan pays the regular quarterly retainer in effect
at the time of departure for as many quarters as the director served with the
Corporation or a subsidiary.  The benefit commences upon departure and is
reduced for departure occurring before age 65.  Accrued and unpaid benefits
under this plan are an unfunded obligation of the subsidiary bank.  Prior
service cost is being amortized over the expected remaining service period of
each director.  Current cost is being recognized based on the present value of
expected future benefits.  The expense of this plan is included in other
noninterest expense and amounted to $89,500, $77,800 and $78,800 for 1994, 1993,
and 1992, respectively.


(13) Income Taxes
As discussed in Note 1, the Corporation adopted SFAS No. 109 as of January 1,
1993.  The cumulative effect of this change in accounting for income taxes was
an increase of $305,000 in consolidated net income.  Financial statements for
1992 have not been restated to apply the provisions of SFAS No. 109.

The components of income tax expense were as follows:

In addition to future taxable income, a primary source of recovery of deferred
tax assets is taxes paid in prior years available for carryback.  A valuation
allowance has been established for a portion of the deferred tax asset that
relates to state income taxes on temporary differences for which no carryback is
allowed.

(14) Loans to Related Parties
At December 31, 1994, the Corporation has made loans in the ordinary course of
business to certain directors and executive officers including their immediate
families and their affiliated companies.  Such loans were made under normal
interest rate and collateralization terms.  A substantial portion of the
increase in 1994 resulted from the adoption of a broader definition of related
parties by the Corporation.  Activity related to these loans in 1994 was as
follows:

(15) Litigation
The Corporation is involved in various claims and legal proceedings arising out
of the ordinary course of business.  Management is of the opinion, based on its
review with counsel of the development of such matters to date, that the
ultimate disposition of these matters will not materially affect the
consolidated financial position or results of operations of the Corporation.


(16) Shareholders' Equity
Stock Split
On July 1, 1994, the Corporation's board of directors voted to approve a 3-for-2
stock split on shares of common stock.  The stock split, in the form of a stock
dividend, was paid on August 31, 1994 to shareholders of record as of August 1,
1994.  The par value of the common stock remained unchanged at $.0625 per share.
Cash payments were made in lieu of issuing fractional shares.  All share and per
share amounts in the consolidated financial statements and related notes have
been restated to reflect the stock split.

Stock Option Plan
The 1988 Amended and Restated Stock Option Plan provides for the granting of
options to directors, officers, and key employees.  Up to 600,000 shares of the
Corporation's common stock may be used from authorized but unissued shares,
treasury stock, or shares available from expired options.  Options are
designated either as non-qualified or as incentive options and may be granted
with stock appreciation rights (SARs).  The exercise price of an option may not
be less than the fair market value on the date of grant.  The option price is
payable in cash, by the delivery of shares of the Corporation's common stock
already owned by the grantee, or a combination thereof.  Options may be granted
at any time until December 31, 1997.  As of December 31, 1994, no options have
been granted with SARs.

All options granted prior to 1993 are exercisable.  Options granted in 1994 and
1993 become vested over a three year period.  The following table presents
changes in options outstanding during 1994 and 1993:

Dividend Reinvestment
Under the Dividend Reinvestment and Stock Purchase Plan, 180,000 shares of
common stock were originally reserved to be issued for dividends reinvested and
cash payments to the plan.

As of December 31, 1994, a total of 679,375 common stock shares were reserved
for issuance under the Stock Option Plan and the Dividend Reinvestment and Stock
Purchase Plan.

Dividends
The source of funds for dividends paid by the Corporation is dividends received
from its subsidiary bank.  The Corporation and its subsidiary bank are regulated
enterprises and their abilities to pay dividends are subject to regulatory
review and restriction.  Certain regulatory and statutory restrictions exist
regarding dividends, loans, and advances from the subsidiary bank to the
Corporation.  Generally the subsidiary bank has the ability to pay dividends to
the parent subject to minimum regulatory capital requirements and subject to
"Guaranty Fund" requirements of the State of Rhode Island.  Under the most
restrictive of these requirements, the subsidiary bank could have declared
aggregate additional dividends of $19.7 million as of December 31, 1994.


(17) Fair Value of Financial Instruments
Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 107, "Disclosures about Fair
Value of Financial Instruments", requires that the Corporation disclose
estimated fair values of its financial instruments.  Fair value estimates are
made as of a specific point in time, based on relevant market information and
information about the financial instrument.  These estimates do not reflect any
pricing adjustments that could result from the sale of the Corporation's entire
holding of a particular financial instrument.  Because no quoted market exists
for a significant portion of the financial instruments, fair value estimates are
based on subjective judgments regarding future expected loss experience, current
economic conditions, risk characteristics of various financial instruments and
other factors.  Changes in assumptions could significantly affect the estimates
of fair value.  Fair value estimates, methods, and assumptions are set forth
as follows:

Cash and Investments
The carrying amount of short-term instruments such as cash and federal funds
sold is used as an estimate of fair value.

The fair value of securities available for sale and investment securities is
estimated based on bid prices published in financial newspapers or bid
quotations received from securities dealers.  No market exists for shares of the
Federal Home Loan Bank of Boston.  Such stock may be redeemed at par upon
termination of FHLBB membership and is therefore valued at par, which equals
cost.

Mortgage Loans Held for Sale
The fair value of mortgage loans held for sale is estimated using the quoted
market prices for sales of similar loans on the secondary market.

Loans
Fair values are estimated for categories of loans with similar financial
characteristics.  Loans are segregated by type and are then further segmented
into fixed rate and adjustable rate interest terms to determine their fair
value.  The fair value of fixed rate commercial and consumer loans is calculated
by discounting scheduled cash flows through the estimated maturity of the loan
using interest rates offered at December 31, 1994 and 1993 that reflect the
credit and interest rate risk inherent in the loan.  The estimate of maturity is
based on the Corporation's historical repayment experience.  For residential
mortgages, fair value is estimated by using quoted market prices for sales of
similar loans on the secondary market, adjusted for servicing costs.  The fair
value of floating rate commercial and consumer loans approximates carrying
value.  The fair value of nonaccrual loans is calculated by discounting
estimated cash flows, using a rate commensurate with the risk associated with
the loan type or by other methods that give consideration to the value of the
underlying collateral.

Deposit Liabilities
The fair value of demand deposits, savings accounts, and certain money market
accounts is equal to the amount payable on demand as of December 31, 1994 and
1993.  The discounted values of cash flows using the rates currently offered for
deposits of similar remaining maturities were used to estimate the fair value of
certificates of deposit.

Federal Home Loan Bank Advances
Rates currently available to the Corporation for advances with similar terms and
remaining maturities are used to estimate fair value of existing advances.

Off-Balance Sheet Instruments
The fair value of interest rate swap agreements is determined based on dealer
quotes.  The fair value of commitments to extend credit is estimated using the
fees currently charged to enter into similar agreements, taking into account the
remaining terms of the agreements and the present creditworthiness of the
counterparties.  For fixed rate loan commitments, fair value also considers the
difference between current levels of interest rates and the committed rates.
The fair value of letters of credit is based on fees currently charged for
similar agreements or on the estimated cost to terminate them or otherwise
settle the obligations with the counterparties.

The following table presents the fair values of the Corporation's financial
instruments:

<FN>
Off-Balance Sheet Instruments:
The notional amount of interest rate swap agreements at December 31, 1994 was
$10.0 million.  The fair value, or the cost to the Corporation of terminating
the swap agreements, was approximately $256,000 at December 31, 1994.  There
were no interest rate swap agreements outstanding at December 31, 1993.

Other off-balance sheet instruments, consisting largely of loan commitments,
contain provisions for fees, conditions and term periods which are consistent
with customary market practices.  Accordingly, the fair value amounts
(considered to be the discounted present value of the remaining contractual fees
over the unexpired commitment period) would not be material.

                 Independent Auditors' Report



The Board of Directors and Shareholders
Washington Trust Bancorp, Inc.:

We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets
of Washington Trust Bancorp, Inc. and Subsidiary (the
Corporation) as of December 31, 1994 and 1993 and the related
consolidated statements of income, changes in shareholders'
equity and cash flows for each of the years in the three-year
period ended December 31, 1994.  These consolidated financial
statements are the responsibility of the Corporation's
management.  Our responsibility is to express an opinion on
these consolidated financial statements based on our audits.

We conducted our audits in accordance with generally accepted
auditing standards.  Those standards require that we plan and
perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about
whether the financial statements are free of material
misstatement.  An audit includes examining, on a test basis,
evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the
financial statements.  An audit also includes assessing the
accounting principles used and significant estimates made by
management, as well as evaluating the overall financial
statement presentation.  We believe that our audits provide a
reasonable basis for our opinion.

In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements
referred to above present fairly, in all material respects,
the financial position of Washington Trust Bancorp, Inc. and
Subsidiary at December 31, 1994 and 1993, and the results of
their operations and their cash flows for each of the years
in the three-year period ended December 31, 1994, in
conformity with generally accepted accounting principles.

As discussed in notes 1 and 3 to the financial statements,
the Corporation adopted a new method of accounting for
certain investments in debt and equity securities effective
January 1, 1994.  As discussed in notes 1 and 13 to the
financial statements, the Corporation adopted a new method of
accounting for income taxes effective January 1, 1993.
