PART III Definitive Proxy Statement of Unigene  Laboratories,  Inc., to be filed
in connection  with the Annual  Meeting of  Stockholders  to be held on June 20,
1996.
<PAGE>
                                PART I
Item 1.  Business.

     Unigene Laboratories, Inc. ("Unigene" or "Company"), incorporated under the
laws of the State of Delaware in 1980, is a health-care  oriented  biotechnology
company  which is  engaged  in  research  and  production  of  laboratory  grade
Calcitonin  and is currently  planning to engage in the production and marketing
in bulk of pharmaceutical grade calcitonin.  It is changing its primary business
from a research oriented business to a pharmaceutical  production business.  The
Company has  succeeded  in  combining  its  proprietary  amidation  process with
bacterial  recombinant  DNA technology to develop a peptide  hormone  production
process.  The Company believes that its proprietary  amidation process will be a
key step in the more efficient and economical  commercial  production of certain
peptide hormones with extensive therapeutic applications. Many of these hormones
cannot be produced at a reasonable  cost in sufficient  quantities  for clinical
testing or commercial use by currently available production processes. Using its
proprietary process, Unigene has produced  laboratory-scale  quantities of seven
such peptide hormones: human Calcitonin, salmon Calcitonin, human Growth Hormone
Releasing Factor,  human Calcitonin  Gene-Related  Peptide,  human Corticotropin
Releasing  Factor,  human  Amylin and a human  Magainin.  During  1991,  a study
commissioned by the Company was prepared by a professor of chemical  engineering
at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.  The study evaluated the economics
for producing  multi-kilogram  quantities of Calcitonin  and indicated  that the
Company's  process  for  producing  Calcitonin  should  reduce the cost and time
required for commercial production by up to 95%.

     The  Company's  strategy is to develop  proprietary  products and processes
with  applications in human  health-care,  independently  or in conjunction with
pharmaceutical  and  chemical  companies,  in order to  generate  revenues  from
license fees, royalties and product sales in bulk. Generally,  the Company seeks
sponsors and licensees to provide research funding and assume responsibility for
obtaining  appropriate  regulatory approvals,  clinical testing,  production and
marketing  of  products  derived  from  Unigene's  research  activities.  It has
concentrated  most of its efforts on one product - calcitonin  for the treatment
of  osteoporosis.  The  Company  has built a  production  facility  and plans to
undertake   production  of  pharmaceutical  grade  calcitonin  and  will  assume
responsibility  for some clinical testing and possibly for obtaining  regulatory
approval.

         Since  1992,  the  Company  has been  producing  and from  time to time
selling small quantities of research-grade  salmon Calcitonin.  During 1993, the
Company began construction of a Good Manufacturing Practice ("GMP") facility for
the production of pharmaceutical-grade  calcitonin in leased premises located in
Boonton,  New Jersey which was mechanically  completed during the fourth quarter
of 1994. The facility will also produce Unigene's  proprietary  amidating enzyme
for use in producing Calcitonin. The initial production capacity of the facility
is  expected  to be  between  0.5-1.0  kilograms  of bulk  Calcitonin  per year,
representing  approximately  10% of the current  estimated world supply for this
leading osteoporosis drug.

         The Company is taking steps to secure the validation of the facility by
the U.S. Food and Drug Administration ("FDA") which is required to allow Unigene
to provide its Calcitonin for human use. The Company believes that validation of
the  facility  should be  completed  in the early  spring of 1996.  Although the
facility is expected to be  validated  first by an  independent  consultant  and
later by the FDA,  there can be no assurance  that this will occur.  In addition
there is no assurance that the facility production goals will be achieved,  that
there will be a market for the Company's products,  that such production will be
profitable to the Company,  that others will not develop  processes and products
superior  to,  or  otherwise  precluding  the  commercial  utilization  of,  the
processes or products  developed  by the Company.  The design of the facility is
intended to allow for substantial  increases in Calcitonin  production utilizing
the existing  equipment with no additional  capital  expenditures  or personnel.
Although  the  facility  will  initially be  exclusively  devoted to  Calcitonin
production, it would be suitable for producing other peptide hormone products in
the future.  There can be no assurance that there will be sufficient  acceptance
of the Company's products in the marketplace for successful commercialization.

         In addition to the validation and FDA approval of the new facility,  it
is necessary to obtain FDA approval for human use of the salmon Calcitonin to be
produced in the facility.  This will require  various human and animal  studies.
The Company will then apply to the FDA for approval of the Company's  Calcitonin
for human use. The Company expects an expedited approval process. However, there
can be no assurance  that necessary  governmental  approvals will be obtained as
projected.  Expanded consumer acceptance of pharmaceutical-grade  Calcitonin may
be dependent on development of a consumer  acceptable  delivery  system. A major
pharmaceutical  company  has  recently  received  approval  of the  FDA  for the
marketing of a nasal spray delivery system for Calcitonin,  which should enlarge
the market for  Calcitonin.  The Company and others are  conducting  research on
oral delivery  systems for  Calcitonin.  There can be no assurance that suitable
delivery  systems  will be  developed  or  that  governmental  approval  of such
delivery systems will be obtained.

         The Company is continuing its efforts to develop a calcitonin  pill. In
December 1995, the Company  successfully tested its proprietary  calcitonin pill
in a Phase I clinical trial. Preliminary results of these studies indicated that
the  majority of those who  received  the pill  showed  levels of the hormone in
blood  samples  taken during the trial.  The Company  believes  that this is the
first time  significant  blood levels of calcitonin have been observed in humans
following oral  administration of the hormone.  Preliminary  results of a second
Phase I trial also showed that blood levels of the drug were obtained in several
of the  recipients.  However,  there is no assurance  that these results will be
replicated in further studies.  The Company plans to file an Investigational New
Drug (IND)  application with the U.S. Food and Drug  Administration as well as a
patent  application  with the U.S.  Patent & Trademark  Office.  There can be no
assurance  that either  application  will be approved as  projected  or that the
Company will be successful in marketing its products.

         The planned  activities  of the  Company  are all subject to  obtaining
adequate  financing.  There  can be no  assurance  that the  Company  will  have
sufficient  resources  to complete  the  preproduction  process,  to produce and
market its products and to carry on its other  projects.  See Part II "Liquidity
and Capital Resources."

         In June,  1995,  the  Company  entered  into an  agreement  for a joint
venture with the Qingdao General Pharmaceutical Company and its Huanghai factory
for the production and marketing in China of Calcitonin  utilizing the Company's
amidation  technology.  Under the agreement,  the Chinese partners would finance
the  project,   including  the   construction   and  operation  of  a  dedicated
manufacturing  facility  in China.  Unigene  would  provide the  technology  and
training and its proprietary  enzyme to the joint venture at a discounted price.
Unigene  would  also  receive a  combination  of fixed fees and  minimum  annual
royalties  based upon sales of the end product.  There is no assurance  that the
joint venture will be successful or that Unigene will receive significant income
from this joint venture.

         The Company has been engaged in four  collaborative  research programs.
Two collaborations, one with Rutgers University College of Pharmacy and a second
with an independent  company,  seek to develop an oral drug delivery  system for
Calcitonin.  The  third  collaboration,   performed  in  conjunction  with  Yale
University,  is  investigating  novel  applications for certain amidated peptide
hormones.  The fourth  collaboration,  with Johns Hopkins School of Medicine, is
investigating changes in certain cancerous cells which, if successful, may allow
for early  diagnosis and treatment.  At present,  the Company has no third party
sponsored  research  agreements in effect.  The Company is currently  conducting
discussions  with major  pharmaceutical  companies  regarding  licensing  and/or
research agreements.

         There can be no  assurance  that such  discussions  will  result in new
research or  licensing  agreements  or that the  Company  will be able to obtain
adequate  funding for its current or new  projects.  The Company is dependent on
large pharmaceutical companies,  having much greater resources than the Company,
for revenues from sales of product,  research  sponsorship,  joint  ventures and
licensing arrangements.

Foreign Sponsorship

         The Company's  potential  major  customers,  partners and licensees are
likely to be foreign corporations or corporations with significant international
business.  Such  corporations'  business  operations  and their  ability  to pay
license  fees,  royalties  and other  amounts due and  otherwise  perform  their
obligations  to the Company under  agreements  with the Company,  are subject to
regulation and approval by foreign  governments and to  international  political
and  currency  fluctuation  problems.  There can be no assurance  that  required
approvals will be received.  Such political and currency problems,  governmental
regulation, or failure to receive required approvals may have a material adverse
effect on the  ability of the  Company to earn or receive  payments  pursuant to
such  agreements and, in such event,  may have a material  adverse effect on the
Company's future operations.

Government Regulation

         The  laboratory  research  activities  of the Company and its sponsors,
collaborators  and potential  licensees and the processes and products which may
be developed by them and the new production facility, are subject to significant
regulation  by  numerous  federal,   state,   local  and  foreign   governmental
authorities.  The  regulatory  process for a  pharmaceutical  product may take a
number  of  years  and  requires  substantial  resources.  In  the  case  of the
regulatory process for the Company's Calcitonin product, which may be handled by
the Company as well as other  entities,  the Company  believes  that the process
will be expedited.  There can be no assurance that  regulatory  approval will be
obtained for the new facility or any of its  products.  The inability to obtain,
or delays in  obtaining,  such  approval  would  adversely  affect the Company's
ability to receive royalties or product revenues. Furthermore, the extent of any
adverse  governmental  regulation  which may arise from future  legislative  and
administrative action cannot be predicted.

Competition

     The  Company's  primary  business  activity to date has been  biotechnology
research. Beginning in 1996, the Company intends to commence the manufacture and
sale of amidated  peptide  hormones,  beginning with  calcitonin.  Biotechnology
research is highly competitive,  particularly in the field of human health-care.
Unigene competes with specialized biotechnology companies,  major pharmaceutical
and   chemical   companies,   universities   and   other   non-profit   research
organizations, many of which can devote considerably greater financial resources
to research activities.

         In the manufacture and sale of amidated peptide  hormones,  the Company
and its  licensees,  if any, will be competing  with contract  laboratories  and
major  pharmaceutical  companies,  many of whom can devote considerably  greater
financial  resources  to  manufacturing  and selling  activities.  However,  the
Company believes that its patented hormone  manufacturing process will enable it
to greatly reduce  manufacturing time and costs in order to successfully compete
with these companies.

         The  Company  believes  that  success in  competing  with others in the
biotechnology  industry will be based  primarily upon  scientific  expertise and
technological  superiority,  the ability to identify  and pursue  scientifically
feasible  and  commercially  viable  opportunities  and  to  obtain  proprietary
protection for research  achievements,  the availability of adequate funding and
the success in developing, testing, protecting, producing and marketing products
and obtaining timely regulatory approval.  There can be no assurance that others
will not develop  processes  or products  which are  superior  to, or  otherwise
preclude the commercial  utilization of, processes or products  developed by the
Company.

Human Resources

     On March 1, 1996,  the Company had 60  full-time  employees of whom 25 were
engaged in research and development activities, 24 were engaged in preproduction
activities and 11 were engaged in general and administrative  functions.  Ten of
the  Company's  employees  hold Ph.D.  degrees.  The  Company's  employees  have
expertise in molecular biology, including DNA cloning, synthesis, sequencing and
expression;  protein  chemistry,  including  purification,  amino acid analysis,
synthesis and  sequencing of proteins;  immunology,  including  tissue  culture,
monoclonal  and polyclonal  antibody  production  and  immunoassay  development;
chemical engineering;  pharmaceutical production; quality assurance; and quality
control.  None of the Company's employees is covered by a collective  bargaining
agreement.

Research and Development

     The Company has  established  a  multidisciplinary  research  team to adapt
current  genetic  engineering  technologies  to the  development  of proprietary
products  and  processes.  Approximately  half of the  Company's  employees  are
directly  engaged in  activities  relating  to plant  validation  processes  and
research and  development  of new,  and  improvement  of existing,  products and
processes. During the years ended December 31, 1995, 1994 and 1993 approximately
$6,876,000,  $5,137,000,  and  $3,357,000,  respectively,  were  spent  on these
activities.

Patents and Proprietary Technology

         The Company has filed  applications  for U.S.  patents  relating to the
proprietary  amidation and immunization  processes invented in the course of its
research.  To  date,  the  following  two  patents  have  issued  in  the  U.S.:
Immunization  By Immunogenic  Implant,  a process  patent,  and  Alpha-Amidation
Enzyme, a process and product patent.  Other  applications are pending.  Filings
relating to the amidation process have been made in selected foreign  countries;
nine such foreign  patents have  issued.  There can be no assurance  that any of
Unigene's  applications  will issue as patents or that  Unigene's  patents  will
provide the Company with significant competitive advantages.  Furthermore, there
can be no  assurance  that  others  will not  independently  develop  similar or
superior  technologies.  Although  the Company  believes  its patents and patent
applications are valid, the invalidation of its Alpha-Amidation Enzyme patent or
the   failure  of  certain  of  its   pending   Alpha-Amidation   Enzyme-related
applications  to issue as patents could have a material  adverse effect upon its
business.  Difficulties  in detecting  and proving  infringement  are  generally
greater with process patents than with product patents.  In addition,  the value
to the  Company of a process  patent may be  reduced  if  products  which can be
derived from such process have been patented by others. For example,  Ciba-Geigy
Corporation  and the Salk Institute hold U.S.  patents for human  Calcitonin and
human Growth Hormone  Releasing Factor,  respectively.  The cooperation of these
patent holders or their sub-licensees would be needed for the  commercialization
of the aforementioned  patented products in countries where these companies hold
valid patents.

Item 7.  Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition
            and Results of Operations
         -----------------------------------------------------------

RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

Revenues  for 1995,  1994 and 1993 from  hormone and enzyme  sales were  $8,000,
$8,000 and $12,000,  respectively.  Revenues in 1994  included  $250,000  from a
final payment from a prior research agreement.

Research and development,  the Company's largest expense,  increased 34% in 1995
to  $6,876,000  from  $5,137,000  in 1994,  after  increasing  53% in 1994  from
$3,357,000 in 1993.  The increases  were related to the Company's  manufacturing
facility,  including  depreciation  charges and expenditures for  pre-production
salaries, the development program for the calcitonin pill, regulatory consulting
fees, as well as the sponsorship of  collaborative  research  programs for which
the  company  spent  $483,000,  $301,000  and  $93,000  in  1995,  1994 and 1993
respectively.

General and  administrative  expenses  increased 29% in 1995 to $2,158,000  from
$1,671,000 in 1994,  after  increasing 36% in 1994 from  $1,230,000 in 1993. The
1995 increase was primarily due to legal and other expenses  associated with the
Company's ongoing financing  activities . The 1994 increase was primarily due to
higher legal fees relating to licensing and joint  venture  negotiations  and to
patent matters.

Interest  and other  income  decreased  $163,000  or 70% in 1995 from 1994 after
decreasing  $606,000  or 72% in 1994  from  1993.  The  decreases  were due to a
reduction in total monies available to be invested.

The Company  incurred  $477,000 in interest  expense in 1995,  up from $1,000 in
1994. This was due to increased borrowings in 1995.

During 1994 the Company  constructed and staffed its manufacturing  facility and
hired  regulatory  consultants  in the U.S. and in Europe.  During both 1995 and
1994, the Company  concentrated on  internally-sponsored  research  programs and
collaborations,  and post research development programs,  including the scale-up
and production of research grade  calcitonin and the development of a calcitonin
pill.  Therefore,  operating  expenses  increased,  and cash decreased causing a
decrease in interest income. In addition, increased borrowings in 1995 increased
interest expense. As a result, the net loss increased  $3,115,000 and $2,581,000
for the years ended  December  31, 1995 and 1994,  respectively,  from the prior
years.

As of December  31, 1995,  the Company had  available  for income tax  reporting
purposes  net  operating  loss   carryforwards  in  the  approximate  amount  of
$34,000,000,  expiring  from 1996 through  2010,  which are  available to reduce
future  earnings which would  otherwise be subject to federal  income taxes.  In
addition,  the Company has investment  tax credits and research and  development
credits in the  amounts  of  $69,000  and  $1,594,000,  respectively,  which are
available to reduce the amount of future  federal  income  taxes.  These credits
expire from 1996 through 2010.

The Company follows  Statement of Financial  Accounting  Standards No. 109 (FASB
109),  "Accounting  for  Income  Taxes".  Given the  Company's  past  history of
incurring  operating losses, any deferred tax assets that are recognizable under
FASB 109 have been fully  reserved.  As of January 1, 1995 and 1994,  under FASB
109,  the Company  had  deferred  tax assets of  approximately  $11,100,000  and
$8,400,000,  respectively,  subject to valuation  allowances of $11,100,000  and
$8,400,000,  respectively. The deferred tax assets were generated primarily as a
result of the  Company's  net  operating  losses and tax credits  generated.  At
December 31, 1995,  the Company's  deferred tax assets and valuation  allowances
each increased by approximately $4,000,000.

Statement of Financial Accounting Standards ("SFAS") No. 121, issued March 1995,
"Accounting for the Impairment of Long-Lived  Assets and Long-Lived Assets to Be
Disposed  Of", is effective  for the Company  beginning in 1996.  The  statement
requires that long-lived assets and certain identifiable  intangibles to be held
and used by an entity be reviewed for impairment  whenever  events or changes in
circumstances  indicate  that  the  carrying  amount  of an  asset  may  not  be
recoverable.  An impairment loss is recognized if the sum of the expected future
cash flows is less than the carrying  amount of the asset.  Management  does not
expect  the  implementation  of SFAS No.  121 to have a  material  impact on the
Company's  financial  position  or results of  operations,  assuming  successful
commercialization of the Company's product and/or the signing of licensing/joint
venture agreements with pharmaceutical companies (see Note 12).

SFAS No. 123, "Accounting for Stock-based Compensation", issued in October 1995,
established   financial  accounting  and  reporting  standards  for  stock-based
employee  compensation  plans.  These plans  include all  arrangements  by which
employees receive shares of stock or other equity investments of the employer or
the employer  incurs  liabilities  to employees in amounts based on the price of
the employer's  stock.  This statement also applies to  transactions in which an
entity  issues  its  equity  instruments  to  acquire  goods  or  services  from
non-employees.  The Company will elect the disclosure  requirements only of FASB
123 and  such  additional  disclosure  requirements  are not  effective  for the
Company until 1996.

LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES

During  1994,  the Company  completed  construction  of its  peptide  production
facility in  Boonton,  New  Jersey.  The  facility  was  constructed  in a shell
building  that is being leased under a 10-year net lease which began in February
1994.  The  Company  has two  10-year  renewal  options  as well as an option to
purchase  the  facility.  The total cost of leasehold  improvements  and process
equipment  for  this  facility,   including   current   validation   costs,   is
approximately  $11.9  million.  The Company is  undertaking  steps to secure the
validation  of the facility by the U.S.  Food and Drug  Administration  to allow
Unigene to provide its calcitonin for human pharmaceutical use.

The Company, at December 31, 1995, had cash and cash equivalents of $259,000,  a
decrease of $333,000 from December 31,  1994.During 1995, Warren P. Levy, Ronald
S. Levy,  and Jay Levy,  officers and directors of the Company,  and a member of
their family loaned a total of $1,905,000 to the Company.  A total of $1,850,000
of these  loans is secured by liens on the  Fairfield  plant and  equipment.  In
March 1995, the Company borrowed  $1,000,000 from an unrelated third party. This
loan was paid off in May 1995 with the proceeds of a new $2,000,000 loan from an
unrelated third party.  The new loan was on a short-term basis secured by all of
the assets of the Company. In connection with that loan, the members of the Levy
family agreed to subordinate their security interests in the Fairfield plant and
equipment to the secured lender and received a subordinated security interest on
the equipment at the Boonton plant.  This  $2,000,000 loan was originally due on
July 7,  1995  with  interest  at 13% per  annum  however,  it was  extended  to
November,  1995 with an interest rate of 24.5% per annum.  In November 1995, the
$2,000,000 loan was repaid from the proceeds of a $3,000,000 debt financing from
two  unrelated  third  parties  collateralized  by almost  all of the  Company's
assets.  In  December  1995 these two parties  loaned the Company an  additional
$300,000.  These loans accrue  interest at a rate of 9.5% per annum. On March 6,
1996 this  $3,300,000  loan was  exchanged for 9.5% Senior  Secured  Convertible
Debentures in the principal amount of $3,300,000. The Debentures mature November
15, 1998 and are  convertible  into shares of the  Company's  common  stock at a
conversion rate of $1.15 per share, subject to certain reset provisions.

From July 1 through  December 31, 1995,  the Company sold in private  placements
approximately 2.8 million shares of its common stock at a price of $1 per share,
which after expenses netted the Company $2.6 million. From January through March
1996,  the Company sold in private  placements an aggregate of 371,000 shares of
common stock receiving net proceeds of $370,000.

In March 1996 the Company  completed a private placement of $9.08 million in 10%
Convertible  Debentures.  The Company  received net proceeds of  $8,172,000 as a
result of this placement.  These Debentures mature March 4, 1999. The debentures
are convertible into common stock for up to one-third of the principal amount on
each of April 27,  1996,  May 27, 1996 and June 26,  1996.  The  debentures  are
convertible at the lower of $2.00 per share or 85% of the market price per share
of the Company's common stock at the date of conversion.

The  Company's  ability to  generate  additional  cash from  operations  depends
primarily  upon signing  research or  licensing  agreements,  achieving  defined
benchmarks  in  such  agreements,  completion  of  plant  validation,  receiving
regulatory  approval  for  its  products,  and  marketing  hormones  and  enzyme
products.  The  Company has signed one joint  venture  agreement.  However,  the
Company has not yet received any revenue  from this  agreement,  and there is no
assurance that any revenues will be received.


The Company  requires  additional  working  capital to continue its  operations.
Management  believes that the Company has  sufficient  cash through at least the
third quarter of 1996. The Company requires  additional funds through  financing
or licensing  agreements to ensure continued  operations.  There is no assurance
that sufficient funds will be obtained.

Independent Auditors' Report


The Stockholders and Board of Directors
Unigene Laboratories, Inc.:


We have audited the financial statements of Unigene Laboratories, Inc. as listed
in the accompanying index. These financial  statements are the responsibility of
the Company's  management.  Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these
financial statements based on our audits.

We  conducted  our  audits  in  accordance  with  generally   accepted  auditing
standards.  Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material
misstatement.  An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting
the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements.  An audit also includes
assessing the  accounting  principles  used and  significant  estimates  made by
management,  as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation.
We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.

In our opinion,  the financial  statements  referred to above present fairly, in
all material respects,  the financial position of Unigene Laboratories,  Inc. as
of December 31, 1995 and 1994,  and the results of its  operations  and its cash
flows for each of the years in the three-year period ended December 31, 1995, in
conformity with generally accepted accounting principles.

The  accompanying  financial  statements  have been  prepared  assuming that the
Company  will  continue  as a  going  concern.  As  discussed  in Note 12 to the
financial statements,  the Company has suffered recurring losses from operations
and has a net working capital deficiency which raise substantial doubt about its
ability to continue as a going  concern.  Management's  plans in regard to these
matters are also  described in Note 12. The financial  statements do not include
any adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty.

                          NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
                  YEARS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 1995, 1994 and 1993



1.  Description  of Business-  Unigene  Laboratories,  Inc. (the  "Company"),  a
health-care  oriented  biotechnology  research company,  was incorporated in the
State of Delaware in 1980. The Company is in the process of changing its primary
business  from a  research  oriented  business  to a  pharmaceutical  production
business. The Company has concentrated most its efforts to date on one product -
calcitonin, for the treatment of osteoporosis.  The Company's calcitonin product
will  require  clinical  trials,  FDA  approval  as  well as  acceptance  in the
marketplace  prior to  commercialization.  Although  the  Company  believes  its
patents  and  patent   applications   are  valid,   the   invalidation   of  its
Alpha-Amidation  Enzyme  patent  or  the  failure  of  certain  of  its  pending
Alpha-Amidation  Enzyme-related  applications  to issue as patents  could have a
material adverse effect upon its business. The Company competes with specialized
biotechnology  companies,   major  pharmaceutical  and  chemical  companies  and
universities  and  research   institutions.   Many  of  these  competitors  have
substantially greater resources than does the Company.

The Company has incurred annual  operating  losses since its inception and, as a
result, at December 31, 1995, had an accumulated  deficit of $33,700,000 and a
working  capital  deficiency  at  December  31,  1995  of  $2,800,000.  Cost  of
improvements,   equipment  and  validation   through  December  31,  1995  total
$11,900,000.  In 1995, the Company borrowed  $3,300,000 from two unrelated third
parties (see Note 5).  Although the Company sold  convertible  debentures in the
principal  amount of $9,080,000 in March 1996 (see Note 12) management  believes
that the Company  requires  additional  funds  through  financing  or  licensing
agreements to ensure continued operations. There is no assurance that sufficient
funds will be obtained.

2.  Summary of Significant Accounting Policies & Practices

Property,  Plant and  Equipment-  Property,  plant and  equipment are carried at
cost.  Depreciation is computed using the straight-line method.  Amortization of
leasehold  improvements  is computed over the remaining  life of the lease using
the  straight-line  method.  The cost of  maintenance  and repairs is charged to
expense as incurred. Significant renewals and betterments are capitalized.

Research and Development- Research and development contract revenues are accrued
based upon the successful  completion of various  benchmarks as set forth in the
individual  agreements.  Research and development  expenditures  are expensed as
incurred.

Patents- Patent costs are deferred  pending the outcome of patent  applications.
Successful  patent costs are amortized using the  straight-line  method over the
lives of the patents.  Unsuccessful  patent costs are expensed  when  determined
worthless.  As of December 31, 1995, two of the Company's  patents had issued in
the U.S.  and nine have  issued in  various  foreign  countries.  Various  other
applications are still pending.

Net Loss per Share- Net loss per share is computed  using the  weighted  average
number of shares outstanding during the period.  Stock options and warrants have
not been included in the calculation since the inclusion of such shares would be
anti-dilutive.

Statements of Cash Flows- The Company  considers  all highly  liquid  securities
purchased  with  an  original  maturity  of  three  months  or  less  to be cash
equivalents.  Interest expense paid was $240,000 in 1995,  $1,000 in 1994 and $0
in 1993.

Use of Estimates-  The  preparation of financial  statements in conformity  with
generally accepted  accounting  principles requires management to make estimates
and assumptions  that affect the reported  amounts of assets and liabilities and
disclosure of  contingent  assets and  liabilities  at the date of the financial
statements  and the  reported  amounts  of  revenues  and  expenses  during  the
reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates.

3. Related Party Transactions

In connection with loans made to the Company by certain stockholders in 1984 and
1985,  which loans were repaid in 1989, the former lenders  received  options to
purchase  400,950  shares of the common stock of the Company,  at prices ranging
from $1.37 to $1.65 per share.  During 1994,  options to purchase 145,800 shares
of common stock were  exercised and options to purchase  72,900 shares of common
stock expired.  During 1995,  options to purchase  80,750 shares of common stock
were exercised and options to purchase 101,500 shares of common stock expired.

During 1994, the Company's  stockholders approved the adoption of a stock option
plan for outside  directors.  This plan  replaced a plan  previously  adopted in
1991. As a result,  the three outside  members of the Board of Directors at that
time were  granted  options,  expiring  in 2004 except if the  individual  is no
longer a director,  to purchase a total of 90,000 shares of the Company's common
stock at $3.00 per share.  During  1995,  one outside  director  retired and his
options  totaling  30,000  shares were  cancelled.  New outside  directors  will
automatically receive stock options for 30,000 shares of common stock upon their
election to the Board of  Directors at a price equal to the fair market value on
the date of grant. At December 31, 1995, options representing 60,000 shares were
outstanding  of which 50,000 shares were  exercisable;  however,  none have been
exercised.

Notes payable - stockholders,  totaling $1,905,000 at December 31, 1995, consist
of notes to Warren P. Levy, Ronald S. Levy and Jay Levy,  officers and directors
of the Company, who in the aggregate own 17% of the Company's outstanding common
stock,  and a member of their  family.  These notes bear interest at the Merrill
Lynch  Margin  Loan  Rate  (approximately  9% at  December  31,  1995)  and  are
collateralized  by subordinated  security  interests in the Company's  Fairfield
plant and Boonton  equipment.  Notes for $1,255,000 were  originally  payable on
demand.  A note for  $650,000 is due on February 10, 1997 and is  classified  as
long-term. Under the terms of the $9.08 million Convertible Debentures (see Note
12),  $1,250,000 of these loans is payable over time based upon the  achievement
of certain corporate benchmarks. Since management expects these benchmarks to be
achieved  during  1996,  $1,250,000  of  these  loans  has  been  classified  as
short-term as of December 31, 1995.

4. Property, Plant and Equipment

Property,  plant and  equipment  consisted of the following at December 31, 1995
and 1994:

                       ==========  ==========

Depreciation  and  amortization  expense on property,  plant and  equipment  was
$1,437,000, $531,000 and $236,000 in 1995, 1994 and 1993, respectively.

5.  Note Payable - Other

Represents a $3.3 million debt financing  received in November and December 1995
from two unrelated  third  parties.  A total of $2.2 million was used to pay off
other short-term debt plus accrued interest.  This note is secured by all of the
Company's  assets and accrues  interest at the rate of 9.5% per annum.  The note
was due in February,  1996. However, on March 6, 1996 the note was exchanged for
Senior  Secured  Convertible  Debentures  with  interest at the rate of 9.5% per
annum, secured by all of the Company's assets,  maturing in 1998. The debentures
are convertible  into shares of the Company's  common stock at a conversion rate
of $1.15 per  share,  subject to certain  reset  provisions.  As a result of the
exchange,  the $3.3  million note at December  31, 1995 has been  classified  as
long-term.

6. Lease

The Company is obligated  under a 10 year net-lease which began in February 1994
for its manufacturing  facility located in Boonton,  New Jersey. The Company has
two 10-year renewal options as well as an option to purchase the facility. Total
future minimum rentals under this  noncancelable  operating lease as of December
31, 1995 are as follows:


                                    YEAR                   RENT

                                                       ==========
Total  rent  expense  for 1995,  1994 and 1993 was  $185,000,  $140,000  and $0,
respectively.

7. Stockholders' Equity

The Company has  outstanding  Class B Warrants  which entitle the holder of each
warrant to purchase one share of Common  Stock for an adjusted  price of $4.1694
per share on or before the  extended  due date of August 11,  1996.  The Class B
Warrants  are subject to  redemption  by the Company if the closing bid price of
the Common Stock, as reported by NASDAQ,  average in excess of an adjusted price
of $5.8372 per share for thirty consecutive business days.

In November and December  1994,  the Company sold in two separate  transactions,
1,135,000  shares of its Common Stock and  received net proceeds of  $2,200,000.
During 1995,  the Company sold an aggregate of 2.8 million  shares of its Common
Stock and  received  total net  proceeds of $2.6  million.  As a result of these
sales  and of prior  transactions  for which no  adjustment  was  required,  and
pursuant to the requirements of the Class B Warrant Agreement,  Unigene adjusted
the exercise price of its Class B Warrants,  as indicated  above, to $4.1694 per
share and adjusted the number of shares of Common Stock thereby  exercisable for
each Class B Warrant to 1.1992 shares of Common Stock.  As a consequence  of the
adjustment  of the price of the Class B Warrants,  the  Redemption  Price of the
Class B Warrants was adjusted to $0.0417 per Warrant and the market price of the
Common  Stock  required to be exceeded in order for the Company to exercise  its
right of redemption was adjusted to $5.8372 per share.

In October  1994,  the Company  entered into a consulting  agreement  with Broad
Capital  Associates,  Inc.  ("Broad").  Broad's  compensation  for its  services
included  the  issuance of  warrants,  exercisable  at $3.00 per share,  for the
purchase of 1,000,000  shares of Common Stock.  During 1995, these warrants were
sold by Broad to an unrelated  third  party.  No proceeds  were  received by the
Company in connection  with this  transaction.  These  warrants  expire in April
1997.

In  connection  with the issuance of stock as  discussed  above and of debt (see
Note 5) during 1995, the Company issued an aggregate of 2,164,000 stock purchase
warrants , expiring from 2000 to 2001,  exercisable at prices ranging from $1.44
to $3.00 per share.  The exercise  prices of the  warrants  were at or above the
fair  market  value of the common  stock at their dates of issue;  therefore  no
value was ascribed to the warrants at the time of their issuances.

8. Stock Option Plans

Under the Unigene  Laboratories,  Inc. 1984 Non-Qualified  Stock Option Plan for
Selected  Employees  (the "1984  Plan")  2,916,000  shares of Common  Stock were
reserved for issuance upon the exercise of options granted.  Each option granted
expires no later than the tenth  anniversary of the date of its grant.  The 1984
Plan terminated in November 1994,  however 329,650  options  previously  granted
continue to be exercisable under that plan.

During  1994  the  Company's  stockholders  approved  the  adoption  of the 1994
Employee  Stock Option Plan (the "1994 Plan").  All employees of the Company are
eligible to  participate  in the 1994 Plan,  including  executive  officers  and
directors who are employees of the Company.  The 1994 Plan is being administered
by the Employee Stock Option Committee which selects the employees to be granted
options,  fixes the number of shares to be covered by the  options  granted  and
determines  the exercise  price and other terms and  conditions  of each option.
During  1995,  options for 582,750  shares of Common Stock were issued under the
1994 Plan.  This total  includes  options for an aggregate of 538,750  shares of
Common Stock which were issued pursuant to an employee "swap"  agreement.  Under
the terms of this offer, employees were eligible to exchange higher priced stock
options for new stock options having an exercise price of $1.625 per share,  the
fair  market  value at the date of the new  agreements.  Old  options  that were
currently  vested  received new extended  vesting  periods,  while certain other
vesting periods were accelerated.  A maximum of 1,500,000 shares of Common Stock
is reserved for issuance  under the 1994 Plan.  Options  granted  under the 1994
Plan will  continue  in effect  for a maximum  of ten (10)  years  from the date
granted.  The purchase  price of the shares  issuable  upon the exercise of each
option cannot be less than the fair market value of the Common Stock at the time
the option is granted.  The 1994 Plan will  terminate on June 16,  2004,  unless
earlier terminated.

Transactions under the plans are as follows:

                                       Option
                       Options          Price

                     -----------     ------------
As of December 31, 1995,  options to purchase  891,250 shares were available for
grant under the 1994 Plan and options for 690,167 shares were exercisable  under
the 1994 and 1984 plans.

During  1993,  a  consultant  received  options to purchase  5,000 shares of the
Company's  common stock at $4.56 per share,  all of which  options are currently
exercisable.  During 1995, the Company granted a stock option to a consultant to
purchase 10,000 shares of the Company's common stock. The consultant is entitled
to purchase an additional 50,000 shares of the Company's common stock if certain
conditions  are met.  These  options  are  exercisable  at $1.44 per  share.  In
addition,  another consultant will receive 10,000 shares of the Company's common
stock when certain conditions are met.

In addition,  at December 31, 1995,  there are 60,000  options  outstanding  and
shares reserved under agreements referred to in note 3.

9. Income Taxes

As of December  31, 1995,  the Company had  available  for income tax  reporting
purposes  net  operating  loss  carryforwards  in the  amount  of  approximately
$34,000,000,  expiring  from 1996 through  2010,  which are  available to reduce
future  earnings which would  otherwise be subject to federal  income taxes.  In
addition,  the Company has investment  tax credits and research and  development
credits in the  amounts  of  $69,000  and  $1,594,000,  respectively,  which are
available to reduce the amount of future federal income taxes.
These credits expire from 1996 through 2010.

The Company follows  Statement of Financial  Accounting  Standards No. 109 (FASB
109),  "Accounting  for  Income  Taxes."  Given the  Company's  past  history of
incurring  operating losses, any deferred tax assets that are recognizable under
FASB 109 have been fully  reserved.  As of January 1, 1995 and 1994,  under FASB
109,  the Company  had  deferred  tax assets of  approximately  $11,100,000  and
$8,400,000,  respectively,  subject to valuation  allowances of $11,100,000  and
$8,400,000,  respectively. The deferred tax assets were generated primarily as a
result of the  Company's  net  operating  losses and tax credits  generated.  At
December 31, 1995,  the Company's  deferred tax assets and valuation  allowances
each increased by approximately $4,000,000.

10. Employee Benefit Plan

The Company,  in 1989,  implemented  a deferred  compensation  plan covering all
full-time  employees.  The plan allows  participants to defer a portion of their
compensation  on a pre-tax  basis  pursuant  to Section  401(k) of the  Internal
Revenue Code, as amended, up to a maximum for each employee of $9,240 for 1995.

11. Research Contract

In  September  1989,  the  Company  executed  a letter  of  intent  with  Berlex
Laboratories,  Inc.  ("Berlex"),  a subsidiary of Schering  A.G.,  Berlin,  West
Germany,  to  investigate  novel  peptide-based  approaches  in the treatment of
certain  cardiovascular  disorders.  The letter of intent provided for Berlex to
obtain a license to  proprietary  technology  already  developed  by Unigene and
Berlex was to sponsor the collaborative research effort. If the research program
proved  to be  successful,  product  development  and  marketing  would  be  the
responsibility of Berlex,  while Unigene would retain a royalty on any resulting
sales.  Under the letter of intent,  $270,800 and $362,500  were  recognized  as
revenue during 1990 and 1989, respectively.  The letter of intent was terminated
in June 1990 and a final  payment of $250,000 was received and included in Sales
and Other  Revenue in 1994.  The Company has no further  obligations  under this
letter of intent.

12. Subsequent Events

The Company has incurred annual operating losses since its inception and in 1994
completed construction of an $11,900,000 manufacturing facility. At December 31,
1995, the Company had a working capital deficiency of $2,800,000. In March 1996,
the Company sold $9.08 million of 10%  Convertible  Debentures  due in 1999 in a
private  placement and received net proceeds of  approximately  $8,200,000.  The
debentures  are  convertible  into  common  stock  for  up to  one-third  of the
principal  amount on each of April 27,1996,  May 27, 1996 and June 26, 1996. The
debentures are  convertible at the lower of $2.00 per share or 85% of the market
price per share at the date of  conversion.  The  Placement  Agent in connection
with the  issuance of the  debentures  received a five-year  warrant to purchase
454,000 shares of the Company's common stock at $2.10 per share.

From  January  through  March 1996,  the Company sold in private  placements  an
aggregate of 371,000 shares of common stock receiving net proceeds of $370,000.

In March 1996,  the Company  exchanged  its  outstanding  $3.3  million  secured
indebtedness  with the  holders  thereof  for $3.3  million  in  Senior  Secured
Convertible Debentures.  The senior debentures mature on November 15, 1998, bear
interest at the rate of 9.5% per annum and are secured by  substantially  all of
the assets of the  Company.  In  accordance  with the terms on which the holders
initially  assumed the indebtedness in November 1995, the senior  debentures are
convertible  into shares of the Company's  common stock at a conversion  rate of
$1.15 per share, subject to certain reset provisions.

The Company is seeking to commercialize  its calcitonin by producing and selling
calcitonin  from its  manufacturing  plant, by signing  licensing/joint  venture
agreements with  pharmaceutical  companies and by developing a calcitonin  pill.
There can be no assurance that these goals will be achieved. Management believes
that  the  Company  requires  additional  funds  through  financing  or  license
agreements to ensure continued operations. There is no assurance that sufficient
funds will be obtained.

UNIGENE  LABORATORIES,  INC., a Delaware  corporation  with a principal place of
business at 110 Little Falls Road, Fairfield, New Jersey 07004 ("Unigene").


                                 R E C I T A L:
                                 - - - - - - -

         A. Unigene is engaged  principally  in research and  development in the
field of biotechnology and plans to commence manufacturing peptide hormones. Its
common stock is currently traded on the NASDAQ market.

         B. Purchasers are private investment companies.

         C.  Pursuant  to  a  certain  Assignment   Agreement  (the  "Assignment
Agreement")  dated  November 17,  1995,  among the  Purchasers,  Unigene and The
Microcap Fund,  Inc. (the "Fund"),  the Purchasers  have acquired from the Fund:
(i) all rights of the Fund in the Note dated May 8, 1995 (the  "Original  Note")
with an original principal amount of $2,000,000 (the "Initial Principal Amount")
plus  accrued  and  unpaid  interest  through  such date in an  amount  equal to
$221,330  (the  "Initial  Accrued  Interest");  (ii) all  rights  of the Fund in
225,000 warrants (the "Purchased Warrants"),  expiring July 7, 2000, to purchase
Unigene's  Common  Stock  (the  "Common  Stock")  at a price of $1.375 per share
(subject  to  certain  anti-dilution  provisions);  (iii) all rights of the Fund
under that certain Securities  Purchase Agreement dated as of May 8, 1995 by and
between the Fund and Unigene (the "Original Agreement"),  including the Original
Note and the Documents as defined therein (the "Original  Documents");  and (iv)
all security interests,  liens and collateral  assignment  interests of the Fund
arising under and with respect to the Original  Documents and securing Unigene's
obligations  evidenced by or arising  under or in  connection  with the Original
Agreement and Original Note (such obligations  being hereinafter  referred to as
the "Original Obligations").

         D.  The  Purchasers  entered  into  the  transaction  described  in the
foregoing  recital  solely as an  accommodation  to  Unigene  (and with the full
knowledge and consent of Unigene),  and as an interim step toward receiving from
Unigene  certain  Senior  Secured  Convertible  Debentures  and an amendment and
restatement of the Original Agreement in its entirety.

         E. The  Purchasers  and  Unigene  entered  into a  Securities  Issuance
Commitment  Agreement  dated  November  17, 1995 (the  "Commitment"),  which (i)
provided for the  Purchasers to lend  $778,670 to Unigene (the "Initial  Interim
Loan") and (ii) set forth the parties'  mutual  intention  that Unigene issue to
the  Purchasers  the  aforesaid  Senior  Secured  Convertible  Debentures in the
aggregate  principal  amount of $3,000,000  to  substitute,  amend,  restate and
re-evidence  (but not as a novation or refinancing of) the Original  Obligations
(including the Initial  Principal  Amount and the Initial  Accrued  Interest) as
well as to evidence the Initial Interim Loan.

         F. On or about December 21, 1995,  the Purchasers  loaned an additional
$300,000 to Unigene (the "Second  Interim  Loan"),  and the parties  desire that
Unigene issue and the Purchasers receive  additional Senior Secured  Convertible
Debentures,  of the same tenor as, but of  different  date than,  the  aforesaid
Senior Secured  Convertible  Debentures,  in said $300,000  principal  amount to
re-evidence and restate the Second Interim Loan.

         G.  Unigene  has hereby  agreed to enter into an Amended  and  Restated
Security  Agreement,  an Amended and Restated Trademark Security  Agreement,  an
Amended and Restated Patent Security Agreement, a Leasehold Mortgage, an Amended
and Restated  Collateral  Assignment of License  Rights, an Amended and Restated
Mortgage  and  Security  Agreement,  and an  Amended  and  Restated  Lender  and
Mortgagee's  Consent and Waiver,  in each case among  Unigene and various  other
parties and certain other security documents.

         H.  Unigene  now  proposes  to issue  and sell to  Purchasers,  and the
Purchasers desire to purchase, two 9.5% Senior Secured Convertible Debentures in
the principal  amounts of $3,000,000  (Debenture A) and $300,000  (Debenture B),
respectively,  and on the terms and  conditions  hereinafter  set forth -- which
modify the terms of the Commitment in certain respects -- the Debentures to bear
interest from November 17, 1995  ($3,000,000)  and December 21, 1995 ($300,000),
respectively, but to otherwise be of like and similar tenor.

         I.  Unigene and the  Purchasers  agree that,  effective  as of the date
hereof,  (i) the  Original  Agreement,  Original  Note  and  any  and all  other
agreements and understandings  governing the terms of repayment of or evidencing
the Original  Obligations,  the Initial Interim Loan and the Second Interim Loan
shall be hereby  amended and restated in their entirety by this Agreement and by
the issuance of "Debenture A" and  "Debenture B" referred to and defined  below.
It is the  intention of the parties  hereto that the  execution  and delivery of
this Agreement and the issuance of such Debentures hereby not effect a novation,
payment,  discharge or  extinguishment of any of the Original  Obligations,  the
Initial  Interim  Loan or the  Second  Interim  Loan,  but merely  constitute  a
restatement and substitution of the terms of their repayment and security.

         J. The Purchasers  hereby  acknowledge and agree that as of the date of
hereof  Unigene is not, and has not been,  in default  under the Original  Note,
Debenture A or Debenture B, as  applicable,  by reason of the  occurrence of the
existing Maturity Date (as defined in the Original Note).

                           corporation   ("Unigene"),   and  made   payable   to
                           Purchasers  pursuant  to  that  certain  Amended  and
                           Restated  Securities  Purchase  Agreement dated as of
                           March 6, 1996 among Unigene and such Purchasers. Such
                           substitution   did  not  constitute  a  repayment  or
                           novation  of  the  indebtedness   evidenced  by  this
                           promissory note."

                           (c)  Unigene  shall use best  efforts  to  deliver to
         Purchasers  the favorable  opinions of counsel to Unigene,  in form and
         substance  satisfactory to the Purchasers and substantially  similar to
         those  opinions  delivered in connection  with the Original  Documents.
         Failure to deliver such opinions shall not, however,  in the absence of
         bad  faith,  constitute  a default  under this  Agreement  or under the
         Debentures.

                           2.2  Terms of Debentures.  Unigene shall issue to the
Purchasers two Senior Secured Convertible  Debentures having the terms described
in this  Agreement.  Debenture  A shall be  issued  in the  principal  amount of
$3,000,000 -- relating to the amounts due to Purchasers  based upon the November
17, 1995  transactions  described above  ("Debenture  A").  Debenture B shall be
issued in the  principal  amount of  $300,000  -- relating to the amounts due to
Purchasers  based  upon  the  December  21,  1995  transaction  described  above
("Debenture B"). Collectively,  Debenture A and Debenture B shall be referred to
herein as the "Debentures".

                               2.2.1 Maturity  Date.  The  Debentures  shall all
mature on  November  15,  1998 (the  "Maturity  Date").  Debenture  A shall bear
interest  from  November  17,  1995 and  Debenture  B from  December  21,  1995.
Debenture  A shall be dated  November  17,  1995 and  Debenture B shall be dated
December 21, 1995.

                               2.2.2  Principal  and  Interest.  Interest  shall
accrue on each  Debenture  at the rate of nine and one-half  percent  (9.5%) per
annum, from the date of each Debenture (not the date hereof) until all principal
and interest due on such Debenture are paid in full.  Interest on the Debentures
shall be paid in cash  semi-annually,  on May 15 and  November  15 of each  year
(each an "Interest  Payment Date")  commencing  May 15, 1996.  Interest shall be
calculated on the basis of a 360-day year of 12 30-day months.

                               Payment of the  principal  of and interest on the
Debentures  shall be made by  Unigene  to the  Purchasers  by wire  transfer  of
immediately available funds.

                               2.2.3 Conversion.

                           (a) The Debentures are convertible into Common Stock,
         at any time and from  time to time,  through  the  Maturity  Date.  The
         Debentures  are  initially  convertible  at a price per share  equal to
         $1.15, subject to the following adjustments (the "Conversion Price").


                           (b) On April 1, 1996,  July 1, 1996,  and  thereafter
         annually on July 1 of each subsequent  year (each a "Reset Date"),  the
         Conversion  Price  shall be reset  to the  lower of (i) the  Conversion
         Price  then in effect,  or (ii) 85% of the  Market  Value of the Common
         Stock.

                           (c) In the event that during the Registration  Period
         (as hereinafter defined) an effective  registration  statement covering
         the public resale of the Common Stock  issuable upon  conversion of the
         Debentures  is not in effect  for more than  five  (non-consecutive  or
         consecutive)  months,  the  Conversion  Price  then  in  effect  on the
         Debentures shall be reduced by 5% each.  Subsequent 5% Conversion Price
         reductions shall occur if such registration  statement is not in effect
         as  of  more  than  ten,  fifteen,  twenty,  etc.  (non-consecutive  or
         consecutive)  month-ends during the Registration  Period.  Once reduced
         under  the  preceding  sentence,  the  Conversion  Price  shall  not be
         adjusted  back,   regardless  of  any  future  effective   registration
         statements.

                               2.2.4 Anti-Dilution.

                           (a)  Effectiveness.   The  anti-dilution   provisions
         described in this Section 2.2.4 shall be effective with respect to each
         Debenture  from  such  Debenture's  date of  issuance  until  each such
         Debenture is paid in full,  including  all  principal  and interest due
         thereon, in accordance with the terms thereof.

                           (b)  Computation of Adjusted  Conversion  Price.  The
         Conversion  Price of the Debentures  shall be adjusted  proportionately
         downward  as  provided  in this  Section  2.2.4(b),  in the event  that
         Unigene issues,  other than pursuant to the exercise or conversion of a
         Convertible Security (as hereinafter  defined),  or sells any shares of
         its Common Stock  (including  shares held in Unigene's  treasury) for a
         price  below the  higher of the  then-current  Conversion  Price or the
         then-current Market Value of the Common Stock.  Forthwith upon any such
         issuance or sale,  the  Conversion  Price shall be reduced to the price
         calculated  by  multiplying  the  Conversion  Price by a fraction,  the
         numerator  of which  shall be the sum of (a) the  number  of  shares of
         Common  Stock  outstanding  prior to the  issuance  on a  fully-diluted
         basis,  plus (b) the  number  of  shares  of  Common  Stock  which  the
         aggregate cash consideration  received by the Company for such issuance
         would have purchased at the higher of the then-current  Market Value or
         the then-current  Conversion  Price, and the denominator of which shall
         be the  number  of  shares  of  Common  Stock  outstanding  immediately
         following such issuance on a fully-diluted basis.

                           (c) Options,  Rights,  Warrants and  Convertible  and
         Exchangeable  Securities.  Except with  respect to rights  described in
         Section  2.2.4(i),  if  Unigene  issues  or sells  options,  rights  or
         warrants  to  subscribe  for  shares of  Common  Stock,  or issues  any
         securities or instruments  convertible  into or exchangeable for shares
         of Common Stock  (collectively,  the "Convertible  Securities"),  which
         Convertible  Securities have an exercise,  conversion or exchange price
         (in the case of  warrants  or  options,  when added to the amount  paid
         therefor) below the higher of the then-current  Conversion Price or the
         then-current  Market Value of the Common Stock, the Conversion Price in
         effect immediately prior to the issuance of such Convertible Securities
         shall be  reduced  to a price  determined  by making a  computation  in
         accordance  with  the  provisions  of  Section   2.2.4(b)  above.   The
         Conversion  Price shall be further  adjusted in the manner provided for
         herein, and only downwards, in the event that the conversion,  exercise
         or exchange price of Convertible  Securities is reset subsequent to the
         issuance thereof. For such purposes, all cash consideration received by
         Unigene upon  issuance  thereof and which  Unigene would be entitled to
         receive  upon  exercise,  conversion  or exchange  of such  Convertible
         Securities, shall be deemed to have been received upon issuance of such
         Convertible  Securities,  and the  maximum  number of  shares  (without
         giving  effect to the  anti-dilution  provisions  of such  instruments)
         issuable upon full exercise thereof shall be deemed  outstanding  after
         the issuance of such  Convertible  Securities for which  adjustment has
         been made hereunder for purposes of the Section  2.2.4(b)  calculation.
         No  adjustment  shall  be made  for the  issuance  of  shares  upon the
         exercise,  conversion  or exchange of any  Convertible  Security if any
         adjustment  was made with respect to the  issuance of such  Convertible
         Security.

                           (d) Subdivisions and Combinations.  In the event that
         Unigene  authorizes  a  stock  split  of or  otherwise  subdivides  the
         outstanding   shares  of  Common  Stock,  the  Conversion  Price  shall
         forthwith be proportionately decreased by multiplying it by a fraction,
         the numerator of which shall be one and the  denominator of which shall
         be the number of shares of Common Stock into which each share  existing
         before the subdivision was subdivided. Reverse stock splits and similar
         combinations of the outstanding  shares of Common Stock shall result in
         an adjustment reciprocal to that which is described above.

                           (e) Reclassifications,  Consolidations, Mergers, etc.
         In case of any  reclassification or change of the outstanding shares of
         Common  Stock  (other than a change from par value to no par value,  or
         from no par  value to par  value,  or as a result of a  subdivision  or
         combination),  or in the case of any  consolidation of Unigene with, or
         merger of Unigene into, another corporation (other than a consolidation
         or merger in which Unigene is the surviving  corporation and which does
         not result in any  reclassification or change of the outstanding shares
         of  Common  Stock,  except a change  as a result  of a  subdivision  or
         combination of such shares or a change in par value, as aforesaid),  or
         in the  case of a sale or  conveyance  to  another  corporation  of the
         property of Unigene as an entirety or substantially as an entirety, the
         Purchasers  shall have the right to convert the  Debentures,  as of the
         date of such reclassification,  change, consolidation,  merger, sale or
         conveyance  so as to  acquire  the kind and  number of shares of Common
         Stock  and  other   securities  and  property   receivable   upon  such
         reclassification, change, consolidation, merger, sale or conveyance due
         to the  Purchasers  or  the  owners  of  the  shares  of  Common  Stock
         underlying  the Debentures  acquired at the conversion  price in effect
         immediately prior to the record date for such reclassification, change,
         consolidation,  merger, sale or conveyance;  provided that in the event
         of a sale or  conveyance  to another  corporation  of the  property  of
         Unigene as an entirety or  substantially  as an entirety or in the case
         of a consolidation  of Unigene with or a merger of Unigene into another
         corporation  (hereinafter  a "Sale  Transaction"),  Purchasers  may, at
         their option,  require that the Debentures be paid off,  within 45 days
         of  the  closing  of  the  Sale  Transaction,  as  follows:  (i) if the
         consideration to be paid to the holders of Common Stock under the terms
         of the Sale  Transaction  is either  cash or readily  marketable  stock
         (i.e.,  stock that is traded on the NASDAQ or on a national  securities
         exchange issued by an issuer with a market  capitalization in excess of
         $100 million and with an average daily trading  volume in excess of the
         number of shares issued in the Sale  Transaction),  then the Purchasers
         shall receive such cash or readily  marketable  stock on the same basis
         as all other holders of the Common Stock;  however, (ii) if, and to the
         extent  that,  the  consideration  to be paid to the holders of Unigene
         Common Stock under the terms of the Sale  Transaction is anything other
         than as stated in (i), the  Purchasers  may require that the Debentures
         not be  converted  but  rather  be paid off in cash at $1.25  for every
         $1.00 then owing on the  Debentures  (in respect of both  principal and
         accrued  interest),  such  payment  to be  made  within  10 days of the
         consummation of such Sale Transaction.

                           (f) Dividends and Other Distributions with Respect to
         Outstanding Securities.  In the event that Unigene shall, except as set
         forth in Section 2.2.4(g) and with  Purchasers'  consent as required by
         Section  6.5,  at  any  time  prior  to  the  conversion  of all of the
         Debentures declare a dividend (other than a dividend  consisting solely
         of shares  of Common  Stock or  rights  to  purchase  Common  Stock) or
         otherwise  distribute without market value  consideration  paid, to its
         shareholders  any  monies,  assets,  property,   rights,  evidences  of
         indebtedness,  securities  (other than shares of Common Stock or rights
         to  purchase  Common  Stock),  whether  issued by Unigene or by another
         Person, or any other thing of value, the Purchasers shall thereafter be
         entitled, in addition to the shares of Common Stock or other securities
         receivable upon the conversion  thereof,  to receive,  upon conversion,
         the same monies,  property,  assets, rights, evidences of indebtedness,
         securities  or any  other  thing of value  that  they  would  have been
         entitled to receive at the time of such  dividend or  distribution.  At
         the time of any such  dividend  or  distribution,  Unigene  shall  make
         appropriate reserves to ensure the timely performance of the provisions
         of this Section 2.2.4(f).

                           (g) Subscription Rights for Shares of Common Stock or
         Other Securities.  In the case Unigene or an Affiliate of Unigene shall
         at any time, without market value consideration paid, distribute to its
         shareholders  any rights to subscribe for shares of Common Stock or any
         other securities of Unigene or of such Affiliate,  the Purchasers shall
         be  entitled,  in  addition  to the  shares  of  Common  Stock or other
         securities  receivable upon  conversion,  to receive such rights at the
         time such rights are distributed to the other  shareholders of Unigene,
         on the same basis as the Purchasers would have received such rights had
         the Debentures been converted  immediately prior to the record date for
         such distribution.

                           (h)  Consideration;  Expenses,  etc. For the purposes
         hereof, the consideration  received by Unigene in any transaction shall
         be deemed to be the gross amount  received  therefor  before  deducting
         underwriters'  discounts,  legal fees, finders fees and other costs and
         expenses  incurred in connection  with such issuance or sale determined
         as of the date not  later  than 45 days  after the date of the close of
         the offering with respect to such issuance or sale.

                           (i)   Exceptions  to   Adjustments.   Notwithstanding
         anything  to the  contrary  herein set forth,  no  adjustment  shall be
         required to be made:

                           (i)  upon the issue or exercise of any conversion or
                           exercise option associated with the Debentures or the
                           Purchased Warrants; or

                           (ii) upon the  exercise of any option  heretofore  or
                           hereafter granted to employees,  outside directors or
                           consultants  to Unigene  pursuant to any benefit plan
                           of Unigene; or

                           (iii) upon the  issuance  or sale of Common  Stock or
                           other securities upon the exercise or exchange of any
                           Convertible  Securities  to subscribe for or purchase
                           Common  Stock  which  were  outstanding  on the  date
                           hereof.

                               2.2.5  Preemptive  Rights.  The Purchasers  shall
have preemptive  rights to acquire,  on the same terms as any other purchaser in
any  public or private  financing  transaction  by  Unigene  of Common  Stock or
securities (other than upon the exercise,  conversion or exchange of outstanding
securities) exercisable to purchase or convertible into Unigene Common Stock (or
any  security  with the economic  terms of the Common Stock or such  securities,
whether a "synthetic  equity," a "swap" or whatever),  up to such amount of such
Common Stock or  securities as would result in the  Purchasers  holding the same
percentage of the  outstanding  Common Stock,  on a fully diluted basis, as such
Purchasers held prior to such issuance,  disregarding  securities whose exercise
or conversion  price is $3.75 or more in excess of the average closing bid price
for the Common  Stock for the thirty  trading  days  prior to such  issuance  of
additional  securities by Unigene. Such preemptive rights shall not apply to (i)
the  contemplated  offering  by Unigene of its  convertible  debentures  through
Swartz Investments, LLC and (ii) other offerings of securities prior to December
31, 1996 which offerings are  individually  for 50,000 shares of Common Stock or
less, and which in the aggregate total 250,000 shares of Common Stock or less.

                               2.2.6 Registration Rights. Unigene shall file and
use  commercially  reasonable  efforts  to keep a shelf  registration  statement
effective  covering  resales of the Common Stock issuable upon conversion of the
Debentures  for a period (the  "Registration  Period")  commencing no later than
June 30, 1996 and ending no later than the earlier of (i) February 28, 1999, and
(ii) the date upon  which the  Purchasers  are able to resell  all of the Common
Stock into which the Debentures are convertible without registration.

                               2.2.7 Redemption.

                           (a) The  Debentures  are subject to redemption at the
         election of Unigene as of the 15th day of each month beginning December
         15,  1996,  upon not less than thirty (30) days'  notice,  in a maximum
         principal amount of up to $495,000 per month, provided that the average
         closing  bid price of the  Common  Stock on the  NASDAQ  or a  national
         securities  exchange exceeds 200% (the "Redemption Target  Percentage")
         of the  Conversion  Price for 20 of the 30 trading days  preceding  the
         date of notice.  Such required  Redemption  Target  Percentage shall be
         adjusted   downward  each  month  by  2.083%  such  that  the  required
         Redemption Target Percentage will be 175% of the Conversion Price after
         December 15, 1997,  as  contemplated  by the following  paragraph.  The
         redemption  price  shall  be  equal  to  100% of the  principal  amount
         redeemed,  plus any accrued but unpaid interest to the redemption date.
         Notwithstanding  the foregoing  sentence,  interest  installments whose
         stated  maturity  is on or prior to any such  redemption  date  will be
         payable to the holders of such Debentures as of such redemption date.

                           (b) The  Debentures  are subject to redemption at the
         election of Unigene as of the 15th day of each month beginning December
         15,  1997 upon not less than  thirty  (30) days'  notice,  in a maximum
         principal amount of up to $1,100,000, provided that the average closing
         bid price for the Common  Stock on the NASDAQ or a national  securities
         exchange  exceeds 175% of the Conversion Price for 20 of the 30 trading
         days preceding the date of notice.  The redemption price shall be equal
         to 100% of the  principal  amount  redeemed plus any accrued but unpaid
         interest  to  the  redemption  date.   Notwithstanding   the  foregoing
         sentence, interest installments whose stated maturity is on or prior to
         such  redemption date will be payable to the holders of such Debentures
         as of such redemption date.

                           (c) In the event that either (i) the Common  Stock is
         not listed on NASDAQ or any  national  securities  exchange or (ii) the
         Common Stock  issuable  upon  conversion  of the  Debentures is not the
         subject of an effective registration statement permitting the immediate
         resale of such Common Stock,  Unigene  cannot  exercise its  redemption
         option.  In the event  that  Unigene is  eligible  to and does elect to
         redeem any portion of the Debentures,  the Debenture holders shall have
         the right to convert all or part of the  Debentures  to Common Stock at
         any time  through the close of business on the  redemption  date of the
         Debentures.  Upon  any  conversion  of the  Debentures,  the  Debenture
         holders  shall be  entitled  to receive  any  interest  accrued on such
         Debentures through the close of business on the conversion date.

                           (d) In the event of redemption  of the  Debentures in
         part only, a new Debenture or  Debentures  for the  unredeemed  portion
         will  be  issued  in the  name  of the  holder  of the  Debenture  upon
         cancellation of the redeemed Debenture.

                               2.2.8   Security.   The  amounts  due  under  the
Debentures,  including  all  accrued  but unpaid  interest,  shall be secured by
certain Collateral as provided in the Security Agreement.

                               2.2.9 Transfer.

                           (a) Unigene  shall cause to be kept at its  corporate
         offices a register (the  register  maintained in such office and in any
         other office or agency of Unigene being herein sometimes referred to as
         the  "Security   Register")  in  which,   subject  to  such  reasonable
         regulations  as  it  may  prescribe,  Unigene  shall  provide  for  the
         registration of the Debentures and of the  registration of transfers of
         the Debentures. Unigene shall act as Security Registrar for the purpose
         of  registering  Debentures  and  transfers  of  Debentures  as  herein
         provided.

                           (b) Upon  surrender for  registration  of transfer of
         any Debenture at the office of Unigene,  Unigene shall execute and make
         available for  delivery,  in the name of the  designated  transferee or
         transferees,  one or more new  Debentures  of the same  series,  of any
         authorized  denominations and of a like aggregate  principal amount and
         maturity  or  expiration   date.   All   Debentures   issued  upon  any
         registration  of transfer or exchange of Debentures  shall be the valid
         obligations of Unigene, evidencing the same obligation, and entitled to
         the same benefits under this Agreement,  as the Debentures  surrendered
         upon such registration of transfer or exchange.

                           (c) Every  Debenture  presented  or  surrendered  for
         registration  of  transfer  or for  exchange  shall (if so  required by
         Unigene) be duly endorsed or be accompanied by a written  instrument of
         transfer  in  a  form  satisfactory  to  the  Security  Registrar  duly
         executed,  by the holder  thereof or his attorney  duly  authorized  in
         writing.

                           (d) Unless otherwise provided in the Debentures to be
         transferred  or  exchanged,  no  service  charge  shall be made for any
         registration of transfer or exchange of Debentures.

                           (e) Unigene  shall not be  required  to register  the
         transfer of or exchange any Debenture  selected for redemption in whole
         or in part,  except  the  unredeemed  portion  of any  Debenture  being
         redeemed in part.

               2.2.10 Legend. Each Debenture and each certificate
for shares of Common Stock issued upon the  conversion of the  Debentures  shall
bear a restrictive legend as contemplated by Section 4.3 of this Agreement.

                               2.2.11  Authentication.  The Debentures  shall be
executed on behalf of Unigene by its Chairman of the Board, its President or one
of its Vice Presidents,  under its corporate seal reproduced thereon attested by
its Secretary or one of its Assistant Secretaries.

The  Debentures  together  with any other  document  executed  pursuant  to this
Agreement are hereinafter referred to collectively as the "Documents."

                               2.2.12 Limit on Purchasers'  Equity Ownership and
Number of Shares Issuable upon Conversion of the Debentures.  Purchasers may not
acquire,  pursuant to  anti-dilution  adjustments  or otherwise,  in excess of a
19.5% "fully-diluted"  equity interest in Unigene's Common Stock,  calculated on
the basis prescribed by Securities  Exchange Act Rel. No. 8325, i.e.,  including
all shares of Common Stock into which the Debentures and the Purchased  Warrants
are convertible or exercisable  (regardless of conversion or exercise price), as
the case may be, as outstanding but excluding all shares of Common Stock subject
to acquisition upon conversion or exercise of any derivative  securities held by
any other  investors  (again,  regardless  of  conversion  or  exercise  price).
Consequently,   at  each  time  that  the  number  of  shares  of  Common  Stock
beneficially  owned by the Purchasers  (i.e.,  into which the Debentures and the
Purchased  Warrants are  convertible or  exercisable) is adjusted upward through
the reset of the Conversion Price or the Purchased  Warrants'  exercise price or
otherwise,   a  sufficient   principal   amount  of  the  Debentures   shall  be
automatically  converted into such principal  amount of  Non-Convertible  Senior
Secured  Debentures,  in each case due on November 15, 1998 (and  otherwise upon
events of default as specified in the  Debentures)  and bearing  interest at 17%
per annum, so that Purchasers'  "fully-diluted"  equity interest,  calculated as
set forth above,  does not exceed  19.5%.  The  Non-Convertible  Senior  Secured
Debentures shall be secured pari passu with the Debentures.

                               In  addition  to  the  foregoing   limitation  on
Purchasers' aggregate equity interest in Unigene, and,  notwithstanding any term
or provision of this  Agreement or the  Debentures to the contrary,  in no event
may the total  number of shares  issuable  upon  conversion  of the  Debentures,
irrespective  of which  party or  parties  holds the  Debentures  at the time of
conversion,  exceed 19.5% of Unigene's  outstanding  Common Stock as of the date
hereof.

                  3.  Representations and Warranties of Unigene.  Unigene hereby
represents and warrants to the Purchasers that:

                           3.1   Standing  and   Qualification.   Unigene  is  a
corporation duly organized, validly existing and in good standing under the laws
of the State of Delaware. Unigene is not, nor is it required to be, qualified or
licensed to transact  business  as a foreign  corporation  under the laws of any
State  other  than the  State of its  incorporation  and New  Jersey in order to
enable it to conduct its business as it is  presently  being  conducted,  except
where the failure to be so qualified or licensed is not  reasonably  expected to
have a material adverse effect on its financial condition,  assets,  business or
results  or  operation  or its  ability to perform  its  obligations  hereunder.
Unigene is duly qualified as a foreign corporation and is in good standing under
the laws of the  State of New  Jersey.  Unigene  has full  corporate  power  and
authority  to own or lease its  properties  and other  assets and to conduct its
business as it is now being conducted.

                           3.2  Subsidiaries.  Except as set  forth in  Schedule
3.2,  Unigene does not own any capital  stock or other voting  securities of any
corporation,  partnership or other  organization.  Unigene is not a party to any
joint venture or partnership.  Unigene is the sole vehicle through which Unigene
and its Affiliates conducts its and their business.

                           3.3  Capitalization.  The authorized capital stock of
Unigene consists of 48,000,000  shares of Common Stock, of which, as of December
31, 1995, 23,813,171 shares are issued and outstanding.  There are no dividends,
whether  current or  accumulated,  due or payable on any of the capital stock of
Unigene.

                           3.4  Interests  in  Unigene  Securities.   Except  as
disclosed in Unigene's  Form 10-Q for the  quarter-end  September  30, 1995 (the
"1995 Form 10-Q") or Schedule 3.4, there are no outstanding options, convertible
securities,  warrants or other rights to subscribe for or purchase from Unigene,
nor any plans,  contracts or  commitments  providing for the issuance by Unigene
of, or for the granting by Unigene of rights to acquire:  (i) any capital  stock
in Unigene;  or (ii) any securities  convertible  into or  exchangeable  for any
capital stock or other ownership interest in Unigene.

                           3.5  Authority.  Unigene  (i) has the full  corporate
right,  power and authority to execute and deliver this Agreement and to perform
its  obligations  hereunder and to execute,  deliver and perform its obligations
under the  Documents  (as  defined  in Section  2.2.11),  and (ii) has taken all
necessary  corporate  actions  to  approve  and adopt  this  Agreement  and such
Documents and to authorize the performance of this Agreement and such Documents.
Upon  execution and delivery,  this Agreement and each of the Documents to which
Unigene  is a party is the duly  authorized,  valid and  binding  obligation  of
Unigene,  enforceable  against it, in accordance with its terms,  except as such
enforceability may be limited by applicable bankruptcy,  insolvency, moratorium,
reorganization,  or similar  laws from time to time in effect  which  affect the
enforcement  of  creditors'   rights   generally  and  by  legal  and  equitable
limitations on the  availability  of specific  performance  and other  equitable
remedies  against  it,  public  policy,  and with  respect  to the  priority  of
Purchasers, security interest, subject to applicable filing requirements.

                           3.6  Absence of Conflicts and Consents.  Neither the
execution and delivery of this Agreement and the Documents nor the  consummation
of the  transactions  contemplated  hereby or thereby will (i) breach or violate
any of the terms and  conditions of the Articles of  Incorporation  or Bylaws of
Unigene, or (ii) breach or violate any judgment,  order,  injunction,  decree or
ruling of any court,  arbitrator  or any  governmental  authority,  domestic  or
foreign,  or  any  material  contract,  material  agreement  or  other  material
instrument  to which  Unigene  is a party or any of its  respective  properties,
rights or  assets  is  subject  or which it is bound or with any  statute,  law,
ordinance,   rule  or  regulation  of  any  federal,  state,  local  or  foreign
governmental  authority or regulatory body, the breach or violation of which (A)
would have a material adverse effect on Unigene's properties,  assets, business,
operations,  prospects or financial condition or (B) would impair the ability of
Unigene to execute,  deliver or perform its obligations  under this Agreement or
any Document,  (C) would terminate or result in the cancellation of any payments
under any such  agreement,  contract or  instrument  or (D) would  result in any
material  damages or result in or, except as  contemplated  by this Agreement or
the  Documents,  require the creation or  imposition of any  Encumbrance  of any
nature upon or with respect to any of its properties or assets.

                           3.7 Title to;  Condition  of Assets;  Real  Property.
Except as set forth in Schedule  3.7, all of  Unigene's  assets,  including  the
Premises (as defined in the Mortgage) and Collateral (as defined in the Security
Agreement),  are owned  free and clear of all  material  Encumbrances.  All such
personal  property is in good  operating  condition and in a state of reasonable
maintenance and repair, fit for the purpose for which it is intended. Unigene is
the lessee of property  located at 83 Fulton Street,  Boonton,  NJ pursuant to a
lease dated May 20,  1993,  as amended by First  Amendment to Lease on that same
day. Such lease is in full force and effect and has not been further modified or
amended,  and no event has  occurred  that,  with the passage of time or notice,
would constitute a default thereunder. All other leases that, individually or in
the  aggregate,  are material are valid and subsisting and are in full force and
effect in all material respects.

                           3.8  Conduct of Business.

                           (a) Since September 30, 1995,  except as set forth in
         Schedule  3.8  or  in  its  1995  Form  10-Q,   Unigene  has  preserved
         substantially intact its business organization.

                           (b)  Except  as set forth in  Schedule  3.8 or in its
         September  30, 1995 Form 10-Q,  Unigene has conducted its business only
         in the  ordinary  and usual  course of  business  consistent  with past
         practice and there has not been:

                           (i) any  increase in its  indebtedness  for  borrowed
                           money  incurred  by or on  behalf of  Unigene  or any
                           incurrence  of  any  other  material   obligation  or
                           liability  (fixed or  contingent)  by or on behalf of
                           Unigene,   except  for  the  additional  indebtedness
                           incurred  by  Unigene  through  borrowings  from  the
                           Purchasers,  and except for  obligations  incurred in
                           the ordinary course of business  consistent with past
                           practice;

                           (ii) except for increased  indebtedness  and decrease
                           in stockholders  equity,  any material adverse change
                           in its  assets,  liabilities,  properties,  business,
                           financial  condition or results of  operations or any
                           development  of which its  management  has  knowledge
                           which is  reasonably  likely  to  result  in any such
                           change  other  than any such  change  resulting  from
                           changes in general economic conditions;

                           (iii) any  damage,  destruction,  loss or claim to or
                           against any of its property or other assets,  whether
                           or  not  covered  by  insurance,   which   materially
                           adversely affects its assets,  properties,  business,
                           profits or financial condition;

                           (iv) any sale,  lease,  transfer or other disposition
                           or  mortgage  or pledge of any of its  properties  or
                           other assets,  or an imposition of any Encumbrance on
                           any of its  properties  or other  assets,  other than
                           transactions  in  the  ordinary  course  of  business
                           consistent with past practice;

                           (v) any  cancellation  of any debts owed to or claims
                           held by or on behalf  of  Unigene,  or any  waiver or
                           release of any of its rights of material value;

                           (vi) any dividend or other distribution or payment in
                           respect of, any  subdivision,  consolidation or other
                           recapitalization   of  its   capital   stock  or  any
                           declaration or authorization of any of the foregoing;

                           (vii) any issuance of  additional  warrants or rights
                           to  acquire  any  equity  security  or  any  security
                           convertible  into any  equity  security  of  Unigene,
                           except as contemplated by this Agreement; or

                           (viii) other than as  contemplated by the Commitment,
                           Unigene  has not  agreed  or  consented  to  cause or
                           permit  in  the  future  (upon  the  happening  of  a
                           contingency  or otherwise)  any of its  properties or
                           assets  whether now owned or hereafter  acquired,  or
                           any  income  or  profits  therefrom,  to be or become
                           subject to a lien.

                           3.9 Financial Statements;  SEC Filings. The Financial
Statements (i) were prepared in accordance with the books of account and records
of Unigene,  which  accurately  reflects all assets and transactions of Unigene,
and (ii) present fairly  Unigene's  financial  condition as of the dates thereof
and its results of  operations  for the periods  then ended in  accordance  with
GAAP,  subject,  in the case of the interim  Financial  Statements,  to routine,
recurring year-end  adjustments.  As of the date hereof,  except as set forth in
the  Financial  Statements,  Unigene  has no  material  contingent  liabilities,
liabilities for taxes, unusual commitments or unrealized or unanticipated losses
which are  required to be reflected on a balance  sheet  prepared in  accordance
with GAAP. Unigene has delivered to the Purchasers its Forms 10-K for the fiscal
years  ended  December  31, 1993 and 1994 and its Forms 10-Q for the first three
fiscal quarters of 1995 as filed with the Securities Exchange  Commission.  Such
reports do not contain any untrue statement or omission of any material fact.

                           3.10  Tax and  Other  Returns  and  Reports.  (i) All
federal,  foreign,  state,  provincial and local tax returns and tax reports (or
extensions  relating thereto) required to be filed by or on behalf of Unigene or
any  affiliated,  combined or unitary  group of which Unigene is or was a member
have been filed on a timely basis with the appropriate  governmental agencies in
all jurisdictions in which such returns and reports are required to be filed and
all such returns and reports were true and correct in all material respects when
filed;  and (ii) all  federal,  foreign,  state,  provincial  and local  income,
profits,  franchise,  sales,  use,  occupancy,   property,   severance,  excise,
withholding,  value  added and other taxes as shown on such  returns  (including
interest  and  penalties)  due  from  Unigene  either  directly,  as part of the
consolidated tax return of another taxpayer,  or otherwise,  have been fully and
timely paid, or where payment is not required to have been made, Unigene has set
up an adequate  reserve or accrual for such  payment.  Unigene knows of no basis
for any other tax,  assessment or governmental  charge that,  individually or in
the aggregate, could reasonably be expected to have a material adverse effect on
Unigene, its operations or prospects.

                           3.11  Intellectual Property.

                           (a) Schedule 3.11(a)  accurately lists all registered
         United  States and  Foreign  Patents  and  Trademarks,  and all pending
         United  States  Patent  and  Trademark  applications  that are owned or
         controlled by Unigene.

                           (b)   Schedule    3.11(b)    accurately   lists   all
         Intellectual  Property owned or controlled by others  besides  Unigene,
         the use of which is licensed  to  Unigene.  Unigene is not aware of any
         other  Intellectual  Property  owned or  controlled  by others  besides
         Unigene  that is  material  to the  ability of  Unigene to operate  its
         business as it is currently conducted or as currently contemplated.

                           (c)   Schedule    3.11(c)    accurately   lists   all
         Intellectual  Property  rights  licensed or granted by Unigene to third
         parties.

                           Unigene is the sole and exclusive owner of the entire
         right,  title  and  interest  in  and  to  the  Intellectual   Property
         identified on Schedule  3.11(a) and except for such licenses and rights
         identified on Schedule 3.11(c),  Unigene has not granted nor does there
         exist by implication or operation of law, any license or other right in
         respect  thereof  which  does or  which  will,  subsequent  to the date
         hereof,  permit or enable  any  Person  other  than  Unigene to use the
         Intellectual  Property and,  moreover,  except as set forth in Schedule
         3.11(c),   none  of  said  Intellectual  Property  is  subject  to  any
         Encumbrance. As of the date hereof, there is no pending or, to the best
         knowledge of Unigene,  threatened  claim against Unigene  asserting (A)
         that Unigene's use of any of said  Intellectual  Property  infringes or
         violates  any  rights of third  parties,  (B) that the past or  present
         conduct of Unigene's business infringes or violates the rights of third
         parties,  (C) that any third parties have any rights to use any of said
         Intellectual Property or (D) except as set forth in Schedule 3.15, that
         any third  parties  have or will have any right which  could  adversely
         affect Unigene's ability to use any of the Intellectual  Property after
         the date  hereof;  and to the best  knowledge  of Unigene,  there is no
         basis for any claim of the foregoing  types.  Neither the  Intellectual
         Property  nor  Unigene's  past  or  present  conduct  of  its  business
         infringes or violates the rights of third parties. During the past five
         (5)  years,  Unigene  has not  given any  notice  to any third  parties
         asserting   infringement   by  such  third   parties  of  any  of  said
         Intellectual  Property.  To the best knowledge of Unigene,  there is no
         material  violation  by any person of any right of Unigene with respect
         to the Intellectual Property. Unigene is not aware of any bars or other
         restrictions  with  respect  to its  rights  to  utilize  any  of  said
         Intellectual  Property,  and no bars or other restrictions on Unigene's
         rights to utilize any of said Intellectual Property will be created by,
         or will,  by reason of any action or inaction  by  Unigene,  before the
         date  hereof,   exist  after  the   consummation  of  the  transactions
         contemplated hereby.

                           Nothing has come to the  attention  of Unigene  which
         has led  Unigene  to form the  opinion  that  any of said  Intellectual
         Property  is  invalid  or that its  rights in any of said  Intellectual
         Property are  unenforceable  in any way,  with the proviso that pending
         patent  applications are merely requests for patents,  and there can be
         no guarantee  that those  requests will be granted and that any patents
         will  necessarily be issued based upon said pending  applications,  and
         with the further proviso that applications for trademark  registrations
         are merely  requests for  registration  which may or may not ultimately
         result in registration with the U.S. Patent and Trademark  office.  The
         execution  and  delivery  of this  Agreement  will not affect or impair
         Unigene's  right to continue to use all of said  Intellectual  Property
         without the impairment or alteration thereof and without the payment of
         any license or other fees (other  than that the  license  fees  payable
         under the License Agreements identified in Schedule 3.11(b)).

                           All of the License Agreements  identified on Schedule
         3.11(b) are valid  agreements,  enforceable  in  accordance  with their
         terms,  except that such  enforceability  may be limited by  applicable
         bankruptcy,  insolvency,  moratorium,  reorganization,  bulk  sales  or
         similar laws from  time-to-time  in effect which affect the enforcement
         of creditors'  rights generally and by legal and equitable  limitations
         on  the  availability  of  specific  performance  and  other  equitable
         remedies.  There is no pending  or, to the best  knowledge  of Unigene,
         threatened  claim against  either  Unigene or, to the best knowledge of
         Unigene, the licensor of any Licensed  Intellectual  Property asserting
         that any of the Licensed  Intellectual  Property infringes or conflicts
         with the rights of third  parties,  or that the present or past conduct
         of  Unigene's  business  infringes  or  violates  the  rights  of third
         parties,  and to the best  knowledge of Unigene,  no basis for any such
         claim exists.

                           3.12  ERISA.  Unigene has  complied  in all  material
respects with the  requirements  of ERISA;  no  Reportable  Event (as defined in
ERISA) has  occurred and is  continuing  with respect to any Plan (as defined in
ERISA); and it has no unfunded vested liability under any Plan.

                           3.13  Permits and Licenses.

                           (a)  List  of  Governmental  Permits.  Set  forth  on
         Schedule  3.13(a) is a list and  description  of all Permits  which are
         issued to, held or used by Unigene,  or for which  Unigene has applied,
         and  which  are  material  to  the  operation  and  development  of its
         business.  There  are  no  other  Permits  which  are  material  to the
         operation of Unigene's  business as now conducted.  Except as otherwise
         indicated, all Permits listed in Schedule 3.13(a) are in good standing,
         valid and effective in accordance with their respective terms.  Unigene
         owns the Permits,  free and clear of all Encumbrances and subject to no
         Claims.

                           (b) Compliance  with Permits.  Except as set forth on
         Schedule  3.13(b),  Unigene is in material  compliance with all Permits
         listed  on  Schedule   3.13(a)  and  no  governmental   proceedings  or
         investigations  are  pending  or,  to the best  knowledge  of  Unigene,
         threatened against it relating to noncompliance with such Permits.

                           3.14   Governmental   Authorizations.   No   consent,
approval or authorization  of, or registration,  filing or declaration with, any
governmental authority is required in connection with the execution, delivery or
performance  by Unigene of this  Agreement  or any of the  Documents  other than
those required with respect to the  registration  contemplated  in Section 2.2.6
and  the  security  interest  filings  contemplated  in this  Agreement  and the
Documents.

                           3.15 Litigation and Proceedings.  Except as set forth
on  Schedule  3.15,  there  are no causes  of  action  or other  litigations  or
arbitrations  or  regulatory,   administrative,  zoning  or  other  governmental
proceedings  or  investigations  presently  pending or, to the best knowledge of
Unigene, threatened, before any court, arbitrator,  governmental agency or other
forum either against  Unigene or any of its properties or assets which relate in
any way to Unigene or any of its properties or assets.

                           3.16 FDA Status. The Unigene manufacturing process is
undergoing  formal  validation  in  order  to  obtain  GMP  (Good  Manufacturing
Practice) status.  Unigene has completed testing of the manufacturing  equipment
and  is  now  performing  the  various  manufacturing  process  operations.  The
validation process is essentially  complete when three consecutive  "conformance
batches"  (batches  in  which  all of the  in-process  and  final  product  test
specifications have been met and which are performed in compliance with all cGMP
requirements) of product have been prepared. Unigene has received no notice, and
is not aware of any  state of facts  that  would  lead it to  believe,  that its
Boonton, New Jersey facility will not receive FDA validation to allow Unigene to
produce its Calcitonin for human use in the United States. Finally,  Unigene has
been advised verbally by the FDA that only brief clinical  programs  designed to
test safety and bioequivalence  should be required for the approval of Unigene's
injectable Calcitonin product. Following validation,  Unigene intends to file an
IND  (investigational  new drug  application) and initiate  clinical programs to
support such product approval in 1996.

                           3.17  Environmental  Laws.  Unigene  has  received no
notice, and is not aware of any state of fact that would lead it to believe that
there exists,  or has existed at any real property occupied by it, any hazardous
material in violation of any environmental law, rule or regulation.

                           3.18 Judgments,  Orders and Consent Decrees.  Unigene
is not  subject to any  judgment,  order or decree of, or  agreement  with,  any
court,  arbitrator or regulatory  authority  limiting,  restricting or adversely
affecting  its conduct,  financial  condition or operating  result,  and no such
judgment, order, decree or agreement is pending.

                           3.19  No  Omissions.  No  representation,   warranty,
covenant or  agreement  of Unigene in this  Agreement,  any  schedule or exhibit
attached hereto, or any Document contains nor shall contain any untrue statement
of material fact nor omits nor shall omit to state any material  fact  necessary
to make the statements contained herein and therein not misleading.

                  4.  Representations and Warranties of the Purchasers.

                           4.1  Standing and Capacity.

                           (a) Olympus  represents  and warrants to Unigene that
         it has all requisite  legal and corporate  power to execute and deliver
         this  Agreement  and the  other  Documents  to which it is a party,  to
         purchase  the  Debentures,  and to perform its  obligations  under this
         Agreement and the other  Documents to which it is a party.  Olympus has
         the  capacity  to  enter  into  the  transactions  contemplated  by the
         Documents;  neither the  execution,  delivery nor  performance  of this
         Agreement or the Documents violates any law, rule or regulation, of any
         jurisdiction,  court or administrative judgment, order or decree or any
         agreement applicable to or binding upon Olympus.

                           (b) Nelson represents and warrants to Unigene that it
         has all requisite  legal and  partnership  power to execute and deliver
         this  Agreement  and the  other  Documents  to which it is a party,  to
         purchase  the  Debentures,  and to perform its  obligations  under this
         Agreement  and the other  Documents to which it is a party.  Nelson has
         the  capacity  to  enter  into  the  transactions  contemplated  by the
         Documents;  neither the  execution,  delivery nor  performance  of this
         Agreement or the Documents violates any law, rule or regulation, of any
         jurisdiction,  court or administrative judgment, order or decree or any
         agreement applicable to or binding upon Nelson.

                           4.2 Authority. Each Purchaser represents and warrants
to Unigene that all action  necessary for the purchase of the Debentures and the
performance of its  obligations  under this Agreement and the other Documents to
which it is a party has been duly taken. The Agreement is valid and binding upon
it and  enforceable in accordance  with its terms except as such  enforceability
may be limited by applicable bankruptcy, insolvency, moratorium, reorganization,
bulk  sales,  or  similar  laws  from time to time in effect  which  affect  the
enforcement  of  creditors'   rights   generally  and  by  legal  and  equitable
limitations on the  availability  of specific  performance  and other  equitable
remedies against it, public policy.

                           4.3   Investment   Representation.   Each   Purchaser
represents  and warrants to Unigene that (i) it is acquiring the  Debentures for
investment,  for its own account as  principal  and not with the current view to
distribution or trade thereof, (ii) it is an "accredited investor" as defined in
Rule 501(a) and (iii) the questionnaire  executed and delivered by it to Unigene
in connection with the transactions  contemplated hereby is true and accurate in
all material respects and does not omit any material  information required to be
stated therein or necessary to make the Statements  made therein not misleading.
The  Debentures and shares issued upon  conversion of the Debentures  shall bear
restrictive  legends that are customary for  securities  that are issued without
registration  under the  Securities  Act in  reliance  on a  "private  placement
exemption."

                  5. Affirmative  Covenants of Unigene.  Unigene covenants that,
until the principal of, and interest on, the  Debentures  and all other monetary
obligations  to the Purchasers  under the Debentures  have been paid in full, it
will:

                           5.1  Corporate Existence.  Do all things necessary to
preserve and keep in full force and effect its  existence  (corporate  or other)
and existing name, rights and franchises, and qualify and remain qualified to do
business in each  jurisdiction  in which the failure so to qualify  would have a
material adverse effect on its business,  operating results, assets or condition
(financial or otherwise) or prospects.

                           5.2 Insurance.  Schedule 5.2 lists insurance coverage
currently  maintained by Unigene.  No change in such insurance  coverage will be
made without the Purchasers' consent, which will not be unreasonably withheld or
delayed.

                           5.3  Keeping of Records  and Books of  Account.  Keep
adequate  records and books of account,  in which complete  entries will be made
reflecting all of Unigene's financial transactions.

                           5.4 Inspection  Rights.  At any reasonable  time, and
from time to time,  permit  representatives  of the Purchasers,  upon reasonable
notice to Unigene,  to examine and make copies of and abstracts from its records
and books of account of, and visit its properties  during normal  business hours
and to discuss its affairs,  finances and accounts  with any of its officers and
its independent  certified public  accountants.  The Purchasers agree to keep in
confidence and not to utilize or disclose any confidential  information provided
to them,  including,  without limitation,  financial  statements or information,
business plans, proposed financing or acquisition plans,  information concerning
Unigene's  products,   patents,  patent  applications,   trade  secrets,  secret
processes or other  proprietary  information  unless and until such confidential
information is publicly disseminated by Unigene. This confidentiality  provision
shall  survive the  execution  and  delivery of this  Agreement,  but if Unigene
defaults  on  its   obligations  and  the  Purchasers  take  possession  of  the
Collateral,  such  confidentiality  obligation  shall  terminate  to the  extent
reasonably necessary to enable the Purchasers to sell any of the Collateral.  In
such event, the Purchasers may disclose or use any confidential information in a
manner as it deems  necessary  (in its sole  judgment) to obtain  payment of all
Obligations.

                           5.5 Compliance with Laws.  Comply with the applicable
requirements  of  all  laws  and  all  rules,  regulations  and  orders  of  any
governmental  authority,  the violation of which might be reasonably expected to
have a material  adverse effect on its business,  operating  results,  assets or
condition (financial or other).

         Unigene  stating  that they  have  caused a review  of the  affairs  of
         Unigene to be made and that  based  thereon  nothing  has come to their
         attention  which  would lead them to believe  that any event of default
         ("Event  of  Default")  under the terms of the  Debenture  or any event
         which,  with the lapse of time or the  giving  of notice or both  could

         is not the case, specifying the nature thereof and what action has been
         taken  or is being  taken  or is  proposed  to be  taken  with  respect

         taken, or proposed to be taken, with respect thereto.

                           (d) Promptly  after  Unigene has  knowledge  thereof,
         notice of any action,  suit or proceeding  known to it before any court

         Financial Officer, in form satisfactory to the Purchasers,  stating and
         acknowledging  (a)  the  then  outstanding  principal  balance  of  the
         Debentures,  (b),  the fact that  there  are no  defenses,  offsets  or
         counterclaims   thereto  (or   stating   such   defenses,   offsets  or
         counterclaims,  if any);  (c) that no  Event  of  Default  and no event
         which,  with the  giving of notice or the lapse of time or both,  would
         constitute such an Event of Default exists, or if such is not the fact,
         the facts and circumstances  relating to such Event of Default or other
         event; and (d) that no litigation or administrative proceeding has been
         instituted by or against Unigene if determined adverse to Unigene would

Purchasers shall have a lien.

                           6.3 Change of  Business.  Conduct any  business,  the

constitute an Event of Default under this Agreement, the Debentures and
Security Agreement:

                           (a) Unigene shall default in the payment of principal
         of, or any  interest  on,  the  Debentures,  when and as the same shall
         become due and payable; or

                           (b)  Unigene  shall  incur an event of default in the
         performance  of its payment  obligations  for borrowed  money under any
         note or other obligation for borrowed money in excess of $500,000 which
         has become due and payable by acceleration or otherwise; or

                           (c) any representation or warranty made by Unigene in
         this  Agreement,  the Debentures,  or the Security  Agreement or in any
         other  Document  shall prove to be false or  inaccurate in any material
         respect; or

         period of 14 consecutive  days after Unigene  receives  notice from the
         Purchasers  or  becomes  aware,  or with  the  exercise  of  reasonable
         diligence  should have been aware,  of the event of default,  provided,
         however,  if Unigene shall have commenced to remedy such default during
         such 14 day period and is diligently  seeking to remedy such default at
         the  expiration of such period,  then if the  Purchasers  are satisfied
         that, with the exercise of due diligence in the circumstances,  Unigene
         could not have  remedied  such  default in such 14 day period and that,
         with the  exercise of due  diligence,  such default is capable of being
         remedied by Unigene within a further period of 10 consecutive  days, no
         Event of Default  shall be deemed to have  occurred  under this Section
         7.1(d),   unless  such  default  is  not  remedied  to  the  reasonable
         satisfaction  of the Purchasers by the expiration of such second 10 day
         period; or

                           (e) A final  judgment for the payment of money which,
         together with all other such  undischarged  judgments,  against Unigene
         exceeds an  aggregate  of  $200,000  (after  taking  into  account  any
         proceeds from third party indemnifications and insurance proceeds which
         are paid to Unigene  with  respect to such  liability)  shall have been
         entered  against  Unigene if,  within 14 days after the entry  thereof,
         such  judgment  shall not have been  discharged  or  execution  thereon
         stayed  pending  appeal,  or if, within 14 days after the expiration of
         any such stay, such judgment shall not have been discharged; or

                           (f) A proceeding  shall have been instituted or order
         for relief shall have been made in respect of Unigene in an involuntary
         case under any applicable  bankruptcy,  insolvency or other similar law
         now or  hereafter  in effect,  or for the  appointment  of a  receiver,
         liquidator,  assignee,  custodian,  trustee,  sequestrator  (or similar
         official) of Unigene or for any  substantial  part of its property,  or
         for the winding-up or liquidation of its affairs,  and such  proceeding
         shall remain  undismissed  or unstayed and in effect for a period of 60
         consecutive  days or such court shall enter a decree of order  granting
         the relief sought in such proceeding; or

                           (g) Unigene shall commence a voluntary case under any
         applicable bankruptcy, insolvency or other similar law now or hereafter
         in effect,  or shall  consent to the entry of an order for relief in an
         involuntary   case  under  any  such  law,  or  shall  consent  to  the
         appointment  of  or  taking  possession  by  a  receiver,   liquidator,
         assignee, trustee, custodian,  sequestrator (or other similar official)
         of Unigene or for any substantial part of its property, or shall make a
         general  assignment  for the  benefit of  creditors,  or shall take any
         action in furtherance of any of the foregoing; or

                           (h) Any material  provision  of any  Document  shall,
         after execution and delivery of such Document,  for any reason cease to
         be valid and binding on Unigene,  or Unigene  shall so state in writing
         or  shall  contest  the  validity  or  enforceability  thereof,  or any
         Document shall otherwise cease to be in full force and effect,  and, in
         such case,  the  Purchasers  shall be  adversely  affected  as a result
         thereof; or

                           (i) If  Warren  Levy  and  Ronald  Levy  cease  to be
         officers of Unigene.

                           7.2  Consequences of an Event of Default.

                           (a) If an  Event  of  Default  specified  in  Section
7.1(a),  (g), or (h) shall occur,  the  outstanding  principal  of, and interest
accrued  on,  the  Debentures  and  all  other  obligations  of  Unigene  to the
Purchasers  hereunder  or  under  the  Documents  shall be  immediately  due and
payable, upon written notice from the Purchasers.

                           (b)  If an Event of Default, other than under Section
7.1(a), (g) or (h) shall occur and continue, the Purchasers, at their option, on
14 days prior written notice to Unigene,  may declare the outstanding  principal
of, and interest accrued on, the Debentures and all other obligations of Unigene
to the  Purchasers  hereunder  and under the  Documents to be forthwith  due and
payable, and the same shall thereupon become and be immediately due and payable,
without further notice of any kind.

                           (c)  Upon an  Event  of  Default  and at the time the
principal sum of the Debentures is due and payable,  the Purchasers may exercise
any one of its rights  provided to a secured party under the Uniform  Commercial
Code or other applicable law or under this Agreement,  the Security Agreement or
any one or more of the  Documents  delivered in  connection  with or pursuant to
this Agreement.

                  8. Success Fee. During the period  commencing on March 6, 1996
and ending on December  31,  1996,  Unigene  intends to raise  additional  funds
through "Funding Events" -- including, without limitation, the sale of Unigene's
convertible  debentures  pursuant to the Regulation S offering managed by Swartz
Investments LLC -- in an amount not less than $9,000,000 (the "Minimum Financing
Target").

                  As of December 31,  1998,  Unigene  shall become  obligated to
pay,  such payment to be made as provided in the last  paragraph of this Section
8, to the  Purchasers  an  amount  equal to the sum of (i) 2% of the  Enterprise
Value of Unigene as of such date plus (ii) (a) the  fraction  the  numerator  of
which is the  shortfall  between the Net Proceeds  from  Funding  Events and the
Minimum  Financing Target and the denominator of which is the Minimum  Financing
Target  multiplied by (b) 18% multiplied by (c) the Enterprise  Value of Unigene
as of such date.  Notwithstanding the foregoing,  the amounts payable by Unigene
under clause (i) of this Section 8 shall not exceed $3,000,000;  this limitation
does not apply to clause (ii) of this Section 8.

                  "Enterprise  Value" for  purposes of the  preceding  paragraph
shall equal the sum of (i) the aggregate Market Value of all outstanding  shares
of Common Stock, plus (ii) the principal amount of all outstanding long-term and
short-term  debt, less (iii) the cash held on deposit by Unigene and not subject
to pledge, lien or encumbrance.

                  Unigene  covenants  that it will  exercise  good  faith in not
attempting to manipulate  the December 31, 1998  Enterprise  Value of Unigene to
the detriment of the Purchasers.

                  The  Success  Fee shall be due as of December  31,  1998,  but
shall not be paid  until  completion  and  filing of  Unigene's  1998 Final 10-K
Annual Report with the SEC.  Final  computation of the amount of the Success Fee
shall be based on the audited financial statements included in such Final 10-K.

of the  reasonable  costs  and  expenses  of such  collection,  enforcement  and
protection,  including reasonable  attorneys' fees, of the Purchasers.  Whenever
counsel fees are provided for in this Agreement or any of the  Documents,  it is
understood and agreed that the interests of the Purchasers  (and/or holders) are
substantially  similar and that there shall be no  allowance of counsel fees for
separate counsel of each of the Purchasers (and/or holders).

                           9.3  Representations to Survive.  All representations
and  warranties  contained  herein or in any other  Document  made or  delivered

benefit  of any of the  parties  hereto,  shall be  binding  on and inure to the

any Purchaser to exercise, and no delay in exercising,  any remedy, right, power
or privilege  hereunder,  or under any other  agreement,  security or instrument

single  or  partial  exercise  of any such  remedy,  right,  power or  privilege
preclude any other or further exercise of any other such remedy, right, power or
privilege,  and no waiver  whatsoever shall be valid unless in writing signed by
the  Purchasers  and then  only to the  extent  specifically  set  forth in such
writing.  All remedies,  rights,  powers and privileges  afforded the Purchasers
under this  Agreement,  the  Debentures and any other  agreements,  documents or
instruments  delivered in connection  herewith or therewith  shall be cumulative
and not be exclusive of any remedies, rights, powers and privileges available by
law and shall be available until the Debentures and all interest thereon and all
other  indebtedness  of Unigene to the  Purchasers  have been paid in full.  The
Purchasers may exercise any such remedies,  rights, powers and privileges in any
order or priority.

                           9.8  Severability.  In  case  any  one or more of the
provisions of this Agreement or the Documents shall be held invalid,  illegal or
unenforceable in any respect,  the validity,  legality and enforceability of the
remaining  provisions  hereof and  thereof  shall not be  affected  or  impaired
thereby.

obligations  of the  parties  hereto  shall  be  governed  by and  construed  in
accordance  with the laws of the State of New  York,  except  that the  Security

         THE  DEBENTURES  BEING  SUBSCRIBED  FOR  HEREIN  AND THE  COMMON  STOCK

U.S.  SECURITIES  ACT OF  1933,  AS  AMENDED,  (THE  "ACT")  OR  THE  SECURITIES
COMMISSION OF ANY STATE UNDER ANY STATE  SECURITIES  LAW. THEY ARE BEING OFFERED
PURSUANT TO A SAFE HARBOR FROM REGISTRATION  UNDER REGULATION S ("REGULATION S")
PROMULGATED UNDER THE ACT . THE SECURITIES MAY NOT BE OFFERED, SOLD OR OTHERWISE
TRANSFERRED IN THE UNITED STATES OR TO A U.S. PERSON (AS SUCH TERM IS DEFINED IN

         This Securities Subscription Agreement (the "Agreement") is executed by
the  undersigned  (the  "Subscriber")  in  connection  with  the  offering  (the

                  D, a copy of which definition is attached hereto as Exhibit C.
                  
         2.3      Subscriber's  Economic Risk. The  Subscriber  understands  and
                  acknowledges  that an investment in the Securities  involves a
                  high degree of risk.  Subscriber  acknowledges  that there are

                  represents  that the  Subscriber  is able to bear the economic
                  risk of an investment in the Securities,  including a possible

                  in the Securities.  Further, the Subscriber represents,  as of
                  the date of signing this Agreement, that the Subscriber has no
                  present  need  for  liquidity  in  the   Securities   and  the
                  Subscriber  is  willing  to  accept  such  investment   risks.
                  Subscriber  has reviewed the Disclosure  Documents,  including
                  without  limitation  the Risk  Factors set forth at Exhibit D,
                  prior to subscribing for any Debentures.

         2.4      No  Government  Recommendation  or  Approval.  The  Subscriber

                  Company, the Offering or the subscription for the Securities.

         2.5      No Directed Selling Efforts in Regard to this Transaction.  To
                  the  knowledge  of the  Subscriber,  without  any  independent
                  investigation,  neither the Company,  Placement  Agent nor any
                  other distributor (if any) participating in the Offering,  nor
                  any person acting for the Company, Placement Agent or any such
                  distributor,  has conducted any "directed  selling efforts" in
                  the United States as the term  "directed  selling  efforts" is
                  defined in Rule  902(b) of  Regulation  S,  which in  general,
                  means any  activity  undertaken  for the  purpose  of, or that

                  general  circulation in the United States,  that refers to the
                  offering of the Securities in reliance on Regulation S.

                  Acts") and are being offered and sold pursuant to Regulation S
                  based in part upon the representations of Subscriber contained
                  herein.  The  Common  Stock  does,   however,   carry  certain
                  registration  rights as set forth in the  Registration  Rights
                  Agreement,  in the form of Exhibit Q (see  Section  7.4 below)
                  executed by the parties hereto.

         2.8      No  Public   Solicitation.   Subscriber  knows  of  no  public
                  solicitation or  advertisement  of an offer in connection with
                  the proposed issuance and sale of the Securities.

         2.9      Investment  Intent.  Subscriber is acquiring the Debentures to
                  be issued and sold  hereunder  (and the Shares  issuable  upon
                  conversion of the  Debentures) for his, her or its own account
                  (or a trust  account  if such  Subscriber  is a  trustee)  for
                  investment  and not as a  nominee  and not  with a view to the
                  distribution thereof.  Subscriber  understands that Subscriber
                  must bear the economic  risk of this  investment  indefinitely
                  unless such Debentures or such Shares are registered  pursuant
                  to the Act and any applicable State Acts, or an exemption from
                  such  registration  is available,  and that the Company has no
                  present   intention  of  registering  any  such  sale  of  the
                  Debentures  or  Shares  other  than  as  contemplated  by  the
                  Registration  Rights  Agreement.   Subscriber  represents  and
                  warrants  to the  Company,  as of the date of this  Agreement,
                  that  Subscriber  has no present plan or intention to sell the
                  Debentures   or  the  Shares  in  the  United  States  at  any
                  predetermined time, and has made no predetermined arrangements
                  to sell the  Debentures  or the Shares.  Subscriber  covenants
                  that  neither  Subscriber  nor its  affiliates  nor any person
                  acting  on its or  their  behalf  has  entered  into,  has the
                  intention of entering into, or will enter into any put option,
                  short   position  or  other  similar   instrument,   contract,
                  arrangement  or position  with  respect to the  Debentures  or
                  Common Stock of the Company  anytime  after the earlier of (i)
                  the time  Subscriber  first received the term sheet (the "Term
                  Sheet")  concerning  this  Offering  and (ii)  the  time  that
                  Subscriber  was  first  notified  by  Placement  Agent  of the
                  existence of the Offering (the earlier of which is referred to
                  as the "Time of Notification  of the Offering")  until the end
                  of the  Restricted  Period,  or at any time  for the  intended
                  purpose  of  lowering  the price at which the  Debentures  are
                  convertible into Shares; and neither Subscriber nor any of its
                  affiliates  nor any person  acting on its or their behalf will
                  at  any  time  use  Shares  acquired  upon  conversion  of the
                  Debentures to settle/cover  any put option,  short position or
                  other similar  instrument,  contract,  arrangement or position
                  entered into prior to the end of the Restricted Period.

         2.10     Subscriber Not to Sell or Transfer  Securities in Violation of
                  the Securities Laws.  Subscriber  covenants that he, she or it
                  will  not   knowingly   make  any  sale,   transfer  or  other
                  disposition  of the  Debentures  or the Shares in violation of
                  the Act  (including  Regulation  S),  the  Exchange  Act,  any
                  applicable  State  Acts or the  rules and  regulations  of the
                  Commission or of any state  securities  commissions or similar
                  state authorities promulgated under any of the foregoing.

         2.11     Subscriber's  Power  and  Authority.  Subscriber  has the full
                  power and  authority  to execute,  deliver  and  perform  this
                  Agreement.  This  Agreement,  when  executed and  delivered by
                  Subscriber,  will  constitute  a  valid  and  legally  binding
                  obligation of Subscriber,  enforceable in accordance  with its
                  terms.

         2.12     Signatory's Representation.  The signatory to this Agreement
                  hereby represents and warrants that he, she or it is either:

                  (a) not a U.S. person (as defined in Regulation S), and is not
                  located in the U.S. at the time of signing this Agreement, or

                  (b) a professional fiduciary of Subscriber (as described in
                  Section (o)(2) through
                   (o)(4) of Rule 902 of  Regulation  S),  acting  solely in his
                  capacity as holder of such account, as a fiduciary,  executor,
                  administrator,  or trustee,  and has  completed and signed the
                  accompanying  Certificate  (Exhibit  E)  and  forwarded  it to
                  Placement Agent.

         2.13     No Tax Advice From Company or Its Agents.  Subscriber  has had
                  an opportunity to review with his, her or its own tax advisors
                  the foreign, U.S. federal, state and local tax consequences of
                  this  investment,  and the  transactions  contemplated by this
                  Agreement.  Subscriber is relying  solely on such advisors and
                  not on any statements or representations of the Company or any
                  of its agents and  understands  that  Subscriber  (and not the
                  Company) shall be  responsible  for the  Subscriber's  own tax
                  liability that may arise as a result of this investment or the
                  transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

         2.14     No  Legal  Advice  from  Company  or  Its  Agents.  Subscriber
                  acknowledges  that he, she, or it has had the  opportunity  to
                  review this  Agreement and the  transactions  contemplated  by
                  this  Agreement  with his,  or her or its own  legal  counsel.
                  Subscriber  is relying  solely on such  counsel and not on any
                  statements  or  representations  of the  Company or any of its
                  agents for legal advice with respect to this investment or the
                  transactions  contemplated by this  Agreement,  except for the
                  representations, warranties and covenants set forth herein and
                  on the opinion provided for in paragraph 7.3 herein.

         2.15     Offering Material Statements. Subscriber acknowledges that all
                  offering  materials and documents received by it in connection
                  with  the  offers  and  sales  of  the   Securities   included
                  statements  to the  effect  of those  contained  in the  first
                  legend set forth on the first page of this Agreement

         2.16     No Scheme to Evade Registration.  Subscriber's  acquisition of
                  the  Debentures  is not a  transaction  (or any  element  of a
                  series  of  transactions)  that is part of a plan or scheme to
                  evade the registration provisions of the Act.

3.  Resales of Securities by Subscriber

                  Subscriber   acknowledges,   covenants  and  agrees  that  the
Securities may and will only be resold by it (a) in compliance with Regulation S
and  applicable  State  Acts,  if any;  or (b)  pursuant  to an  exemption  from
registration  under the Act and  applicable  State  Acts  after  the  Restricted
Period; or (c) pursuant to an effective and current Registration Statement under
the Act.  In  addition,  in  connection  with any  resale of the  Debentures  in

                           3. Assignment  Separate from Certificate (in the form
                  of Exhibit H)(or endorsed Certificates);

                           5.  Seller's  Instruction  Letter  (in  the  form  of
                  Exhibit I); and

                           6.  Purchaser  Representation  Letter (in the form of
                  Exhibit J).

         Upon receipt of the executed  documents  listed above, the Company will

pursuant to Section 3.2 after the  Restricted  Period,  free of any  restrictive
legend  restricting  transfer  under the Act) within three (3) business  days of
such  receipt.  The  provisions  of this Section 3 shall not apply to subsequent
resales of Debentures that have previously been sold by Subscriber in compliance
with this Section 3.

4.  Legends; Subsequent Sale of Securities

         4.1      Debenture   Legend.   The   Debenture   shall  bear  a  legend
                  substantially in the form of the first legend set forth on the
                  first page of this  Agreement  (the  "Regulation S Restrictive
                  Legend")  and  any  other  legend  or  legends  as  reasonably
                  required to comply with U.S. federal, state or foreign law.

         4.2      The  Shares  Obtained  Upon   Conversion   Shall  Not  Bear  a
                  Restrictive Legend.  Assuming that there are no changes in the
                  material  facts set forth in  Section 2 of this  Agreement  or
                  applicable  law  from  the  date  hereof  until  the  Date  of
                  Conversion (as that term is defined in the  Debentures) of the
                  Debentures  by   Subscriber,   the  Shares   obtained  upon  a
                  conversion  after  the  Restricted  Period  shall not bear any
                  restrictive  legend  restricting  transfer  under the Act, nor
                  shall any stop  order be  placed on the books of the  Transfer
                  Agent,  provided that the Subscriber delivers to the Company a
                  Certificate in the form of Exhibit L.

         4.3      Removal of Debenture  Legend for Pledge With a Margin Account.
                  Upon the  submission,  at any time after the expiration of the
                  Restricted  Period,  by  Subscriber  of a written  request for
                  removal of the Regulation S Restrictive Legend for the purpose
                  of a bona fide pledge or deposit of  Debentures  with a margin
                  account, together with the Debentures for which legend removal
                  is being requested and a Certificate in the form of Exhibit M,
                  the Company shall immediately  re-issue the Debentures without
                  any restrictive legend restricting  transfer under the Act, or
                  the Company shall irrevocably instruct its designated transfer
                  agent ("Transfer  Agent") to do so, assuming that there are no
                  changes in the  material  facts set forth in Section 2 of this
                  Agreement  or  applicable  law from the date hereof  until the
                  date of such submission. Except for the requirements otherwise
                  set forth in this Agreement, and assuming there are no changes
                  after  the date  hereof  in the  material  facts  set forth in
                  Section 2 of the Agreement or applicable  law, no action other
                  than as set forth in this Section 4.3 shall be required of the
                  Subscriber  to remove  the  Regulation  S  Restrictive  Legend
                  (unless such pledge or deposit would constitute a violation of
                  securities law).

         4.4      The Company's Instructions to Transfer Agent. The Company will
                  issue to its Transfer Agent an irrevocable  instruction letter
                  (the "Irrevocable  Instructions to Transfer Agent") to convert
                  the  Subscriber's  Debentures  to Common Stock (in  accordance
                  with the  Debenture  and,  so long as Section  4.2 is complied
                  with,  free of any  restrictive  legend  restricting  transfer
                  under the Act) upon  receipt of a valid  Notice of  Conversion
                  from a Subscriber and the original Debentures,  and such other
                  documents as are required by this Agreement or the Debenture.

5.       Issuance of Securities in the Near Future; Notice Requirements

         The Company shall not issue any debt or equity  securities  for cash in
         private capital raising transactions  ("Future Offerings") for a period
         of seventy five (75) days after the Last Closing without  obtaining the
         prior  written  approval  of  Subscribers  holding  a  majority  of the
         principal  amount of  Debentures  then  outstanding,  provided that the
         preceding  shall  not  limit the  Company's  right to  conduct a public
         secondary  offering.  The Company will not conduct any Future Offerings
         for a period of two hundred and forty (240) days after the Last Closing
         without delivering to the Subscriber prior written notice of its intent
         to conduct a Future Offering (a "Future Offering Notice") setting forth
         the material terms of the proposed Future Offering. For a period of ten
         (10) days,  commencing  on the date of receipt of such Future  Offering
         Notice  (the  "Offer  Period"),  the  Subscriber  shall  have the right
         irrevocably  to commit to purchase  the  Subscriber's  Portion (as that
         term is defined  below) of the  securities  being offered in the Future
         Offering on the terms  contained  in the Future  Offering  Notice.  If,
         during the Offer Period,  the Subscriber fails irrevocably to commit to
         purchase  the  Subscriber's  Portion  of the  securities  that  are the
         subject of the Future Offering  Notice,  the Company shall be permitted
         to  offer  and sell any such  securities,  on terms  generally  no less
         favorable  to the  Company  than are set forth in the  Future  Offering
         Notice,  to any  third  party  during  a period  of  ninety  (90)  days
         following the termination of the Offer Period after which 90 day period
         the terms of this Section 5 shall again apply (the limitations referred
         to in the  preceding  sentences  of  this  Section  5 are  collectively
         referred to as the "Capital Raising  Limitation").  The Capital Raising
         Limitation  shall not apply to any transaction  involving the Company's
         commercial   banking   arrangements   or  issuances  of  securities  in
         connection  with a  merger,  consolidation  or  sale of  assets,  or in
         connection  with or as part of the same  transaction as a joint venture
         or other  acquisition  or  disposition  of a  business,  a product or a
         license  by  the  Company,   or  exercise  of  options  by   employees,
         consultants or directors or any transaction with a strategic  corporate
         partner or to loan  securitization  or sales of loans to master trusts.
         The Capital Raising  Limitation also shall not apply to the issuance of
         securities  upon  exercise  or  conversion  of the  Company's  options,
         warrants or other  convertible  securities  outstanding  as of March 5,
         1996,  or to the  grant  of  additional  options  or  warrants,  or the
         issuance of  additional  securities,  under any Company stock option or
         restricted  stock plan. The amount of securities  which a Subscriber is
         entitled  to  purchase  in such a Future  Offering  (the  "Subscriber's
         Portion")  shall be a number  obtained  by  multiplying  the  aggregate
         amount  of  securities  being  offered  in  the  Future  Offering  by a
         fraction,  the numerator of which is the aggregate  principal amount of
         Debentures  purchased by the Subscriber  pursuant to this Agreement and
         the  denominator  of  which  is  the  aggregate   principal  amount  of
         Debentures placed in the Offering.  If the Company fails to obtain from
         purchasers  of Debentures in the Offering  irrevocable  commitments  to
         purchase  90% of the proposed  Future  Offering,  the Company  shall be
         released from any  obligation  under this Section 5 to the  Subscribers
         with respect to such Future Offering.

6.       Representations and Warranties of Company

         Company represents and warrants to Subscriber as follows:

         6.1      Organization, Good Standing, and Qualification. The Company is
                  a corporation  duly  organized,  validly  existing and in good
                  standing  under  the  laws of state  of  Delaware  and has all
                  requisite  corporate  power  and  authority  to  carry  on its
                  business as now conducted and as proposed to be conducted. The
                  Company is duly qualified to transact  business and is in good
                  standing  in each  jurisdiction  in which  the  failure  to so
                  qualify would have a material  adverse  effect on the business
                  or properties of the Company and its  subsidiaries  taken as a
                  whole.  The Company,  is not the subject of any pending or, to
                  its knowledge,  threatened  investigation or administrative or
                  legal proceeding by the Internal  Revenue Service,  the taxing
                  authorities  of  any  state  or  local  jurisdiction,  or  the
                  Securities and Exchange Commission which could have a material
                  adverse  effect  and  which  have  not been  disclosed  in the
                  reports referred to in Section 2.2 above.

         6.2      Corporate  Condition.  The  Company's  condition  was,  in all

                  or any  judgment,  or decree to which it is  subject,  that is
                  identified to such counsel by the Company.

         7.4      Registration  Rights.  The Company will grant  Subscriber  the
                  registration  rights  covering  the Common  Stock  issuable on
                  conversion of the Debentures on the terms of the  Registration

         7.5      Notification  of Final  Closing  Date &  Restricted  Period by
                  Company. Within five (5) business days after the Last Closing,
                  the Company  shall notify the  Subscriber  in writing that the
                  Last Closing has occurred,  the date of the Last Closing,  the
                  date upon which the  Restricted  Period  will  terminate  with
                  respect to the Securities,  the dates that the Subscribers are
                  entitled   to  convert  the   respective   portions  of  their
                  Debentures  and the Fixed  Conversion  Price,  as that term is
                  defined in the Debenture.

         7.6      Payments for Late Conversion or Failure to Reserve  Authorized
                  but Unissued Common.

                  (a)  Payments  for  Late  Conversion.  As  set  forth  in  the
                  Debentures,  the Transfer Agent or the Company (as applicable)
                  shall,  no later  than 6:00 P.M.  (New York City  time) on the
                  third  business  day (the  "Deadline")  after  receipt  by the
                  Company or its Transfer  Agent of a notice of  conversion  and
                  all necessary  documentation  duly executed and in proper form
                  required  for  conversion,  including  receipt by the Transfer
                  Agent  of the  original  Debentures  to be  converted,  all in
                  accordance   with  the  terms  of  the   Debentures  and  this
                  Agreement,  issue a  certificate  for the  number of shares of
                  Common Stock to which the holder  ("Holder") of the Debentures
                  shall be entitled as aforesaid  and  surrender  such  original
                  Common  Stock  certificates  to a common  courier  for  either
                  overnight or (if delivery is outside the United  States) 2-day
                  delivery  to the  Holder at the  address  of the Holder on the
                  books of the Company.  The Company understands that a delay in
                  the issuance and delivery of the Shares of Common Stock beyond
                  the Deadline  could result in economic loss to the Holder.  As
                  compensation  to the Holder for such loss,  the Company agrees
                  to pay late payments to the Holder for late issuance of Shares
                  upon  conversion  in accordance  with the  following  schedule
                  (where  "No.  Business  Days Late" is defined as the number of
                  business days beyond the Deadline):

                                                 Late Payment For Each
                                                 $10,000 Of Debenture Principal
                  No. Business Days Late             Amount Being Converted
                  ----------------------             ----------------------

                           1                              $100
                           2                              $200
                           3                              $300
                           4                              $400
                           5                              $500
                           6                              $600
                           7                              $700
                           8                              $800
                           9                              $900
                           10                             $1,000
                           greater than 10                $1,000 + $200 for each
                                                               Business Day Late
                                                               beyond 10 days

                  In the event  that the  number of shares of Common  Stock that
                  the  Company  reasonably  calculates  to be  due a  particular
                  Subscriber  upon  conversion  is different  from the number of
                  shares claimed by the Subscriber, by virtue of the calculation
                  of the conversion  rate or other  information set forth in its
                  Notice of  Conversion,  the Company  shall direct the Transfer
                  Agent to issue,  in accordance  with the  procedures set forth
                  above and in the  Debentures,  to the Subscriber  certificates
                  for a number of shares  equal to the lesser of the two numbers
                  and, as to the issuability of the remaining disputed number of
                  shares of Common Stock,  shall submit the dispute within three
                  business  days after the  receipt of such  Holder's  Notice of
                  Conversion to the  Company's  usual  outside  accounting  firm
                  ("Accountant")  for  determination  of the number of shares of
                  Common Stock to be issued. In the event of such a dispute, the
                  Company  agrees to instruct its  Accountant,  at the Company's
                  expense, to resolve any such dispute and notify the parties of
                  the result within three  business days after the  Accountant's
                  receipt of notice of such dispute. Within two business days of
                  its receipt of the  Accountant's  results,  the Company  shall
                  direct  the  Transfer   Agent  to  issue  to  the   Subscriber
                  certificates for any additional shares (the "Disputed Shares")
                  to which the Subscriber is entitled. The Disputed Shares shall
                  not be subject to the late payment  provisions of this Section
                  7.6(a).

                  To the extent  that the  failure  of the  Company to issue the
                  Common  Stock  pursuant  to  this  Section  7.6  is due to the
                  unavailability  of  authorized  but unissued  shares of Common
                  Stock,  the  provisions of this Section 7.6(a) shall not apply
                  but instead the provisions of Section 7.6(b) shall apply.

                  The Company shall pay any payments incurred under this Section
                  7.6(a)  in  immediately   available  funds  within  three  (3)
                  business  days  from the date of  issuance  of the  applicable
                  Common Stock.  Nothing  herein shall limit a Holder's right to
                  pursue actual  damages for the Company's  failure to issue and
                  deliver  Common  Stock to the Holder  pursuant to the terms of
                  the Debenture.

                  (b)  Payments for Failure to Reserve  Authorized  but Unissued
                  Common . If,  at any time a Holder  of  Debentures  submits  a
                  Notice  of  Conversion  (as  defined  in the  Debenture),  the
                  Company  does  not have  sufficient  authorized  but  unissued
                  shares  of  Common  Stock  available  to  effect,  in full,  a
                  conversion of the Debentures under Section 4 of the Debenture,
                  subject to the  Company's  right to redeem such  Debentures in
                  accordance with the terms thereof (a "Conversion Default", the
                  date  of  such  default  being   referred  to  herein  as  the
                  "Conversion  Default  Date"),  the Company  shall issue to the
                  Holder all of the shares of Common Stock which are  available,
                  and the Notice of Conversion as to any Debentures requested to
                  be converted but not converted (the "Unconverted  Debentures")
                  shall become null and void.  The Company shall provide  notice
                  of such Conversion Default ("Notice of Conversion Default") to
                  each Holder of outstanding  Debentures,  by facsimile,  within
                  three (3)  business  days of such  default  (with the original
                  delivered by overnight  or two (2) day  courier).  Holders may
                  not submit a Notice of Conversion after receipt of a Notice of
                  Conversion  Default until the date additional shares of Common
                  Stock are authorized by the Company.

                           The   Company   agrees  to  pay  to  all  Holders  of
                  outstanding  Debentures  payments  for  a  Conversion  Default
                  ("Conversion  Default  Payments")  in the  amount of (N/365) x
                  (.24)  x  the  initial   issuance  price  of  the  outstanding
                  Debentures  held by each  Holder  where N = the number of days
                  from  the   Conversion   Default   Date  to  the   date   (the
                  "Authorization Date") that the Company authorizes a sufficient
                  number of shares of Common Stock to effect  conversion  of all
                  remaining   Debentures.   The   Company   shall  send   notice
                  ("Authorization   Notice")  to  each  Holder  of   outstanding
                  Debentures, by facsimile, within three (3) business days after
                  the  Authorization   Date  (with  the  original  delivered  by
                  overnight or two (2) day courier)  that  additional  shares of
                  Common Stock have been authorized,  the Authorization Date and
                  the amount of Holder's accrued  Conversion  Default  Payments.
                  The accrued  Conversion Default shall be paid in cash or shall
                  be convertible  into Common Stock at the  Conversion  Rate (as
                  that  term is  defined  in the  Debenture),  at the  Company's
                  option,  and shall be  payable to each  Holder of  outstanding
                  Debentures by the fifth day of the following calendar month.

                  Nothing  herein shall limit the  Subscriber's  right to pursue
                  actual  damages  for  the  Company's  failure  to  maintain  a
                  sufficient number of authorized shares of Common Stock.

                           7.7 Listing.  The Company  shall  effect,  as soon as
                  practicable following the Closing,  subject to Company's right
                  to redeem such Debentures, the listing of the shares of Common
                  Stock issuable upon the conversion of the Debentures on Nasdaq
                  or another national securities exchange or quotation system.

         8. Events of Defaults.  If any of the following events of default (each
an "Event of Default") shall occur:

                           8.1 Conversion.  The Company fails to issue shares of
                  Common Stock to the Holder upon  exercise by the Holder of the
                  conversion  rights of the Holder in accordance  with the terms
                  of the  Debenture  and this  Agreement  fails to transfer  any
                  certificate  for shares of Common  Stock  issued to the Holder
                  upon  conversion  of the  Debenture  and when  required by the
                  Debenture  or fails to remove  any  restrictive  legend on any
                  certificate or any shares of Common Stock issued to the Holder
                  upon  conversion  of the Debenture as and when required by the
                  Debenture  or  this  Agreement  and  any  such  failure  shall
                  continue uncured for 10 trading days;

                           8.2 Breach of  Covenant.  The  Company  breaches  any
                  material  covenant or other  material term or condition of the
                  Debenture (other than as specifically  provided in Section 8.1
                  hereof),  or this Agreement and the breach of which would have
                  a material  adverse  effect on the Company or the prospects of
                  the Company or a material  adverse effect on the Holder or the
                  rights of the Holder  with  respect to the  Debentures  or the
                  shares  of  Common  Stock  issuable  upon  conversion  of  the
                  Debentures and such breach  continues for a period of ten (10)
                  business days after written notice thereof to the Company from
                  the Holder;

                           8.3 Breach of  Representations  and  Warranties.  Any
                  representation  or warranty  of the Company  made herein or in
                  any  agreement,  statement  or  certificate  given in  writing
                  pursuant  hereto or in connection  herewith  shall be false or
                  misleading in any material respect when made and the breach of
                  which would have a material  adverse  effect on the Company or
                  the prospects of the Company or a material  adverse  effect on
                  the  Holder or the rights of the  Holder  with  respect to the
                  Debentures  or  the  shares  of  Common  Stock  issuable  upon
                  conversion of the Debentures;

                           8.4   Receiver  or   Trustee.   The  Company  or  any
                  subsidiary  of the Company  shall make an  assignment  for the
                  benefit  of  creditors,   or  apply  for  or  consent  to  the
                  appointment  of  a  receiver  or  trustee  for  it  or  for  a
                  substantial  part  of its  property  or  business;  or  such a
                  receiver or trustee shall otherwise be appointed;

                  subsidiary  of the  Company  or any of its  property  or other
                  assets for more than  $500,000,  and shall  remain  unvacated,
                  unbonded or  unstayed  for a period of thirty (30) days unless
                  otherwise  consented to by the Holder,  which consent will not
                  be unreasonably withheld; or

                           8.6     Bankruptcy.      Bankruptcy,      insolvency,
                 reorganization  or liquidation  proceedings or other proceeding
                 for relief under any  bankruptcy  law or any law for the relief

amount of the Debentures owned by such Holder to the date of payment; multiplied
by (b) the percentage (the "Default Percentage") set forth below with respect to
the date on which such Event of Default occurs:

Holder  shall  have the right at any time,  so long as the  Company  remains  in
default,  to require the Company,  upon written notice, to immediately issue, in
lieu of such amounts,  the number of shares of Common Stock of the Company equal

Price then in effect.

                          REGISTRATION RIGHTS AGREEMENT

         THIS REGISTRATION RIGHTS AGREEMENT  ("Agreement") is entered into as of
March 12, 1996, by and among UNIGENE LABORATORIES, INC., a Delaware corporation,
("Company"),  Swartz Investments,  LLC., a Georgia limited liability corporation
("Swartz  Investments")  and the  subscribers  ("Subscribers")  to the Company's
offering ("Offering") of up to $9,080,000 of Debentures pursuant to Regulation S
Subscription  Agreements  between the Company and the  Subscribers  of even date
herewith ("Subscription Agreement").

                  1.       Definitions. For purposes of this Agreement:

                  (a) The terms  "register",  "registered,"  and  "registration"
refer  to a  registration  effected  by  preparing  and  filing  a  registration
statement or similar  document in compliance with the Securities Act of 1933, as
amended (the "Act"),  and the declaration or ordering of  effectiveness  of such
registration statement or document;

                  (b) The term  "Registrable  Securities"  means  the  shares of
Common Stock issuable or issued upon (i) conversion of the Debentures  issued to
Subscribers in the Offering and (ii) exercise of the Warrant; provided, however,
that (x) after the expiration of the Restricted  Period,  shares of Common Stock
obtainable on conversion of the Debentures (in whole or in part),  and (y) after
two years from the date of this Agreement,  shares of Common Stock obtainable on
exercise of the Warrant (the "Warrant Shares"), shall not constitute Registrable
Securities,  if  those  shares  of  Common  Stock  may  be  resold  in a  public
transaction  without  registration  under the Act,  including without limitation
pursuant to Rule 144 under the Act.  Upon request of any Holders of Common Stock
issued or issuable upon conversion of the Debentures or exercise of the Warrant,
the Company shall cause legal counsel,  reasonably acceptable to such Holder, to
issue an opinion addressed to the holders, stating that such Common Stock may be
sold without  registration  and without  restriction  on resale under the Act as
described in the provisions of the immediately  preceding sentence,  in form and
substance reasonably satisfactory to such Holder.

                  (c) The  number  of  shares of  "Registrable  Securities  then
outstanding"  shall be  determined by the number of shares of Common Stock which
have been issued or are issuable upon  conversion of the Debentures and exercise
of the Warrant at the time of such determination;

                  (d) The term  "Holder"  means any person  owning or having the
right to acquire Registrable Securities or any permitted assignee thereof; and

                  (e) The term  "Warrant"  means the  warrant  granted to Swartz
Investments in connection with the Offering.

                  (f) "Restricted  Period" has the meaning ascribed to that term
in the Subscription Agreement.

                  2.       Demand Registration.

                  (a) At any  time  beginning  after  the end of the  Restricted
Period,  the  Holders of  Registrable  Securities  obtained or  obtainable  upon
conversion  of  at  least  25%  in  principal  amount  of  the  Debentures  then
outstanding  ("Initiating  Holders") may notify the Company in writing that they
demand that the Company file a registration statement under the Act covering the
registration of all of the Registrable  Securities then outstanding  (other than
Registrable  Securities  held by any  Holder  who does  not want to be  included
therein).  Upon receipt of such notice, the Company shall, within ten (10) days,
give  written  notice of such  request to all Holders and shall,  subject to the
limitations of subsection 2(b), file within 60 days of receipt of such request a
registration  statement  to  effect  the  registration  under  the  Act  of  all
Registrable Securities which the Holders request, by notice given to the Company
within (10) days of receipt of the Company's notice, and use its best efforts to
cause such  registration  statement  to become  effective as soon as possible (a
"Demand  Registration").  The Company may include in such registration statement
any other  securities of the Company  which the holders  thereof are entitled to
have so included  pursuant to any agreement entered into by the Company prior to
the date hereof (the "Additional Shares").

                  (b)  If  the  Initiating  Holders  intend  to  distribute  the
Registrable  Securities  covered by their  request by means of an  underwriting,
they shall so advise the  Company as a part of their  request  made  pursuant to
this Section 2 and the Company  shall  include such  information  in the written
notice referred to in subsection 2(a). In such event, the right of any Holder to
include his  Registrable  Securities in such  registration  shall be conditioned
upon such Holder's  participation in such underwriting and the inclusion of such
Holder's  Registrable  Securities  covered by the registration  statement in the
underwriting  (unless otherwise mutually agreed by a majority in interest of the
Initiating  Holders and such Holder).  All Holders proposing to distribute their
securities  through  such  underwriting  shall  (together  with the  Company  as
provided in subsection  6(f)) enter into an underwriting  agreement in customary
form with the  underwriter or underwriters  selected for such  underwriting by a
majority in interest of the Initiating Holders, and reasonably acceptable to the
Company.

                  (c) The  Company  is  obligated  to  effect  only  one  Demand
Registration  pursuant to Section 2 of this  Agreement.  The  Company  agrees to
include all  Registrable  Securities  held by all  Holders in such  registration
statement;  provided  that,  in the event  that (i) the  Registrable  Securities
covered by such  registration  statement  are to be  distributed  pursuant to an
underwriting  and (ii) the  managing  underwriter  determines,  and  advises the
Company in writing, that marketing factors require a limitation on the number of
shares  (including   Additional   Shares)  to  be  underwritten,   the  managing
underwriter  may  require  the  exclusion  from the  underwriting  of the excess
shares,  with  the  shares  to  be  excluded  allocated  among  the  Registrable
Securities and all  Additional  Shares in respect of which the exclusion of such
Additional Shares on any other basis would violate the contractual rights of the
holders of such  Additional  Shares,  in the proportion  that the number of such
Registrable  Securities or Additional  Shares which each holder thereof seeks to
register  bears to the total number of  Registrable  Securities  and  Additional
Shares  sought to be  included  by all  holders of  Registrable  Securities  and
Additional  Shares.  In the event the Company  breaches  its  obligation  of the
preceding sentence, or Registrable Securities are excluded from the registration
statement  by reason of the  proviso  thereof,  any  Holders of the  Registrable
Securities  which were not  included  in such  registration  statement  shall be
entitled to a Demand Registration for such excluded securities on the same terms
as the Demand Registration described in this Agreement.

                  (d)  The  Company  is  not   obligated   to  effect  a  Demand
Registration  under this Section 2 if, in the written  opinion of counsel to the
Company reasonably acceptable to the person or persons from whom written request
for registration has been received (and  satisfactory to the Company's  transfer
agent to permit the  transfer),  registration  under the Act is not required for
the  immediate   public  transfer  of  the  Registrable   Securities,   with  no
restrictions on resale,  pursuant to Rule 144 or any other applicable  exemption
from registration.

                  (e) The Company  represents  that it is eligible to effect the
registration   contemplated  hereby  on  Form  S-3  and  will  use  commercially
reasonable efforts to maintain such eligibility.

                  3. Piggyback  Registration.  If (but without any obligation to
do  so)  the  Company  proposes  to  register  (including  for  this  purpose  a
registration  effected by the Company for  shareholders  other than the Holders)
any of its Common Stock under the Act in connection  with the public offering of
such  securities  (other  than a  registration  relating  solely  to the sale of
securities to participants in a Company  employee benefit plan or a registration
on  Form  S-4  promulgated  under  the  Act or any  successor  or  similar  form
registering stock issuable upon a reclassification,  upon a business combination
involving an exchange of securities or upon an exchange  offer for securities of
the issuer or another  entity),  the Company shall, at such time,  promptly give
each Holder written  notice of such  registration.  Upon the written  request of
each  Holder  given  within  ten (10) days after  mailing of such  notice by the
Company,  which request shall state the intended  method of  disposition of such
shares by such Holder,  the Company shall cause to be  registered  under the Act
all of the  Registrable  Securities  that each such Holder has  requested  to be
registered  (a "Piggyback  Registration").  The Company may elect not to proceed
with, or suspend the effectiveness  of, a Piggyback  Registration at any time in
its sole discretion and without prior consultation with any Holder.

                  4.       Limitation on Obligations to Register.

                  (a) In the case of a Piggyback Registration on an underwritten
public  offering by the Company,  if the  managing  underwriter  determines  and
advises in writing  that the  inclusion  in the  registration  statement  of all
Registrable  Securities  proposed  to  be  included  would  interfere  with  the
successful  marketing of the  securities  proposed to be offered and sold by the
Company, then the number of such Registrable Securities,  if any, to be included
in the registration statement as determined by the managing underwriter shall be
allocated  among all Holders who had requested  Piggyback  Registration,  in the
proportion  that the number of  Registrable  Securities  which each such Holder,
including  Swartz  Investments,  seeks to register  bears to the total number of
Registrable  Securities  sought to be included by all Holders,  including Swartz
Investments.

                  (b)  Notwithstanding  anything  to the  contrary  herein,  the
Company shall have the right (i) to defer the filing of a registration statement
(or any amendment  thereto) or any request for  acceleration of effectiveness of
any Demand Registration and (ii) after effectiveness,  to suspend  effectiveness
of any such registration statement,  if, in the good faith judgment of the board
of directors of the Company and upon the advice of counsel to the Company,  such
delay in filing or requesting  acceleration of  effectiveness or such suspension
of effectiveness  is necessary in light of the existence of material  non-public
information  (financial or otherwise)  concerning the Company, the disclosure of
which at the time is not, (A) otherwise  required and (B) in the best  interests
of the Company;  provided  however that the Company will use its best efforts to
terminate  such delay or  suspension as soon as  practicable  and, in any event,
will not delay  effectiveness  of such Demand  Registration  for more than three
months  from the date of the  demand or suspend  effectiveness  for more than 60
days,  unless  it is  then  engaged  in an  acquisition  that  would  make  such
registration  impracticable,  in  which  case it will use its  best  efforts  to
eliminate such impracticability as soon as possible.

                  5.  Obligations  to  Increase  Available  Shares.  If  after a
registration statement is filed pursuant to Section 2 the shares of Common Stock
issuable  upon the  conversion  of the  Debentures  is  change  by reason of the
adjustment of the Conversion Rate, the number of Registrable  Securities covered
by the registration statement shall be proportionally adjusted. If required, the
Company  shall amend that  registration  statement,  or file a new  registration
statement, or both, so as to cover such additional Registrable  Securities.  The
Company  shall  use   commercially   reasonable   efforts  to  effect  such  new
registration within ninety days.

                  6.  Obligations of the Company.  Whenever  required under this
Agreement to effect the registration of any Registrable Securities,  but subject
to the  limitations  on the  obligations  of the Company set forth  herein,  the
Company shall, as expeditiously as reasonably possible:

                  (a)  Prepare  and file with the SEC a  registration  statement
with respect to such  Registrable  Securities  and use  commercially  reasonable
efforts to cause such registration statement to become effective.

                  (b  Prepare  and  file  with  the  SEC  such   amendments  and
supplements to such registration statement and the prospectus used in connection
with  such  registration  statement  as may be  necessary  to  comply  with  the
provisions  of the  Act  with  respect  to the  disposition  of the  Registrable
Securities covered by such registration statement.

                  (c) With respect to any Demand Registration,  use commercially
reasonable efforts to keep such registration statement effective for a period of
at least 180 days or, if earlier  until the  Holders of  Registrable  Securities
covered by such registration statement have completed the distribution described
in the registration statement.

                  (d)  Furnish  to the  Holders  such  numbers  of  copies  of a
prospectus,  including a preliminary prospectus,  as they may reasonably request
in order to facilitate the disposition of Registrable  Securities covered by the
registration statement.

                  (e)  Use  commercially  reasonable  efforts  to  register  and
qualify the Registrable  Securities covered by such registration statement under
such other  securities or Blue Sky laws of such of the United States as shall be
reasonably  requested by the Holders of the  Registrable  Securities  covered by
such registration statement,  provided that the Company shall not be required in
connection  therewith or as a condition  thereto to qualify to do business or to
file a general consent to service of process in any such states.

                  (f) In the event of any underwritten  public  offering,  enter
into and perform its  obligations  under an  underwriting  agreement  that is in
usual and customary form with the managing  underwriter  of such offering.  Each
Holder  participating in such underwriting shall also enter into and perform its
obligations under such underwriting agreement.

                  (g) Notify each Holder of  Registrable  Securities  covered by
such  registration  statement at any time when a prospectus  relating thereto is
required to be delivered under the Act of the happening of any event as a result
of which the prospectus,  as then in effect,  includes an untrue  statement of a
material fact or omits to state a material fact required to be stated therein or
necessary  to make the  statements  therein not  misleading  in the light of the
circumstances then existing.

                  (h)  Furnish,   at  the  request  of  any  Holder   requesting
registration of Registrable  Securities pursuant to this Agreement,  on the date
that  Registrable  Securities  are  delivered  to the  underwriters  for sale in
connection with a registration  pursuant to this Agreement,  if such Registrable
Securities  are  being  sold  through  underwriters,  or,  if  such  Registrable
Securities  are not  being  sold  through  underwriters,  on the  date  that the
registration statement with respect to such securities becomes effective, (i) an
opinion,  dated such date,  of the  counsel  representing  the  Company  for the
purposes of such registration,  in form and substance as is customarily given to
underwriters in an underwritten public offering,  addressed to the underwriters,
if any,  and to the  Holders of such  Registrable  Securities  and (ii) a letter
dated  such date,  from the  independent  certified  public  accountants  of the
Company,  in form and substance as is customarily  given by  independent  public
accountants to underwriters in an underwritten public offering, addressed to the
underwriters, if any, and to the Holders of such Registrable Securities.

                  (i)  Use  commercially  reasonable  efforts  to  maintain  the
listing of the Common Stock on NASDAQ Small Cap Market,  NASDAQ  National Market
System or a national  securities  exchange for as long as any of the Registrable
Securities are still outstanding.

                  7. Furnish  Information.  It shall be a condition precedent to
the  obligations  of the Company to take any action  pursuant to this  Agreement
that the selling Holders shall furnish to the Company such information regarding
themselves,  the Registrable Securities held by them, and the intended method of
disposition of such  securities as shall be required to effect the  registration
of  their  Registrable  Securities  or to  determine  that  registration  is not
required by reason of the availability of Rule 144 or other applicable provision
of the Act.

                  8.       Future Grants.

                  (a) The Company  represents  and  warrants to the Holders that
the number of securities  constituting  Additional Shares are the 100,000 shares
of Common Stock initially  issuable upon the exercise of certain warrants issued
by the Company prior to the date hereof  (warrants for 50,000 shares were issued
on March 15, 1995 and warrants for 50,000  shares were issued on April 15, 1995,
collectively  the "Existing  Warrants") and such additional  number of shares of
Common Stock as may be issued, pursuant to certain anti-dilution  provisions set
forth in the Existing Warrants, upon exercise thereof.

                  (b) During the period commencing on the date hereof and ending
on the date of termination of this Agreement, the Company shall not grant to any
person  registration  rights with respect to Common Stock that are senior to the
registration rights granted herein.

                  9. Expenses of Demand Registration.  All expenses,  other than
underwriting   discounts   and   commissions,   incurred  in   connection   with
registrations,  filings or  qualifications  pursuant  to  Section  2,  including
(without limitation) all registration,  filing and qualification fees, printers'
and accounting  fees,  fees and  disbursements  of counsel for the Company,  and
including the reasonable fees and disbursements incurred of only one counsel for
the selling Holders,  shall be borne by the Company;  provided,  however, if the
registration request is subsequently  withdrawn at the request of the Holders of
a majority of the Registrable Securities to be registered, the Company shall not
be  required  to pay for  any  expenses  of any  registration  proceeding  begun
pursuant  to  Section  2 (in  which  case all  Holders  who had  requested  such
registration  shall by jointly and  severally  liable for such  expenses and the
Holders of  Registrable  Securities  shall  have no  further  rights to a Demand
Registration);   provided  further,  however,  that  if  at  the  time  of  such
withdrawal,  the  Holders  have  learned  of a  material  adverse  change in the
condition,  business,  or  prospects of the Company from that which was publicly
known at the time of their  request,  then the Holders  shall not be required to
pay any of such expenses and shall retain their rights pursuant to Section 2.

                  10. Expenses of Company  Registration.  The Company shall bear
and pay all expenses  incurred in connection  with any  registration,  filing or
qualification  of  Registrable  Securities  with  respect  to the  registrations
pursuant  to  Section 3 for each  Holder,  including  (without  limitation)  all
registration,  filing,  and  qualification  fees,  printers and accounting  fees
relating  or  apportionable  thereto  (and  including  the  reasonable  fees and
disbursements  incurred by only one counsel for the selling Holders  selected by
them), but excluding underwriting discounts and commissions relating to the sale
of Registrable Securities.

                  11.  Indemnification.  In the event any Registrable Securities
are included in a registration statement under this Agreement:


                  (a) To the extent permitted by law, the Company will indemnify
and hold harmless each "Holder Indemnified Person" (defined for purposes of this
Section 11 as each Holder of registrable securities included in the registration
statement,  the  officers  and  directors  of each such  Holder  acting in their
capacity as such,  any  underwriter  (as defined in the Act) for such Holder and
each person, if any, who controls such Holder or underwriter  within the meaning
of the Act or the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the "1934 Act")),
against any losses, claims, damages, expenses, or liabilities (joint or several)
("Losses") to which they may become subject under the Act, the 1934 Act or other
federal or state law,  insofar as such  Losses (or  actions in respect  thereof)
arise out of or are based upon any of the  following  statements,  omissions  or
violations  (collectively a "Violation"):  (i) any untrue statement,  or alleged
untrue  statement of a material fact contained in such  registration  statement,
including any preliminary  prospectus or final prospectus  contained  therein or
any amendments or supplements thereto,  (ii) the omission,  or alleged omission,
to state therein a material fact required to be stated therein,  or necessary to
make the  statements  therein  not  misleading,  or (iii) any  violation  by the
Company  of the Act,  the 1934  Act,  any  state  securities  law or any rule or
regulation  promulgated under the Act, the 1934 Act or any state securities law;
and the Company will reimburse each such Holder Indemnified Person for any legal
or other expenses  reasonably  incurred by them in connection with investigating
or defending  any such Loss or action;  provided,  however,  that the  indemnity
agreement  contained in this subsection 11(a) shall not apply to amounts paid in
settlement of any such Loss or action if such settlement is effected without the
prior written  consent of the Company (which  consent shall not be  unreasonably
withheld), nor shall the Company be liable in any such case for any such Loss or
action to the extent  that it arises out of or is based upon a  Violation  which
occurs in either (i) in reliance upon and in conformity with written information
furnished  expressly for use in connection  with such  registration  by any such
Holder  Indemnified  Person  or  any  of  its  directors,  officers,  agents  or
affiliates or (ii) based upon a prospectus which included a Violation, after the
Company has advised the Holder not to sell pursuant to such prospectus,  and has
made  available  an  amended  or  supplemental  prospectus  that  corrects  such
Violation.

                  (b) To the extent  permitted by law,  each  selling  Holder of
Registrable Securities included in the registration statement will indemnify and
hold harmless the "Company Indemnified Persons" (defined for the purpose of this
Section 11 as the Company,  each of its officers and directors in their capacity
as such, each person, if any, who controls the Company within the meaning of the
Act  or the  1934  Act,  any  underwriter  and  any  person  who  controls  such
underwriter  within the meaning of the Act or the 1934 Act and any other  Holder
Indemnified Person selling securities in such registration  statement),  against
any Loss (joint or several) to which the Company or any such director,  officer,
controlling  person, or underwriter or controlling  person, or other such Holder
Indemnified  Person may  become  subject,  under the Act,  the 1934 Act or other
federal or state law, insofar as such Loss (or actions in respect thereto) arise
out of or are based upon any Violation,  in each case to the extent (and only to
the extent) that such Violation  occurs in reliance upon and in conformity  with
written information furnished by such Holder or any of its directors,  officers,
employees,  agents  or  affiliates  expressly  for use in  connection  with such
registration;  and each such Holder will  reimburse any legal or other  expenses
reasonably  incurred by the Company and any such Company  Indemnified  Person in
connection with  investigating  or defending any such Loss or action;  provided,
however,  that the indemnity  agreement contained in this subsection 11(b) shall
not  apply to  amounts  paid in  settlement  of any such  Loss or action if such
settlement  is effected  without the consent of the Holder,  which consent shall
not be unreasonably  withheld;  provided,  that, in no event shall any indemnity
under this subsection 11(b) exceed the gross proceeds from the offering received
by such Holder.

                  (c) Promptly after receipt by an indemnified  party under this
Section  11  of  notice  of  the  commencement  of  any  action  (including  any
governmental action), such indemnified party will, if a claim in respect thereof
is to be made against any  indemnifying  party under this Section 11, deliver to
the  indemnifying  party a written  notice of the  commencement  thereof and the
indemnifying  party shall have the right to  participate  in, and, to the extent
the indemnifying  party so desires,  jointly with any other  indemnifying  party
similarly  noticed,   to  assume  the  defense  thereof  with  counsel  mutually
satisfactory to the parties; provided,  however, that an indemnified party shall
have the right to retain its own counsel,  with the reasonably incurred fees and
expenses  to be  paid  by the  indemnifying  party,  if  representation  of such
indemnified  party by the counsel  retained by the  indemnifying  party would be
inappropriate  due to actual  or  potential  differing  interests  between  such
indemnified  party and any  other  party  represented  by such  counsel  in such
proceeding.  The failure to deliver  written  notice to the  indemnifying  party
within a reasonable time of the commencement of any such action,  if prejudicial
to its ability to defend such action,  shall relieve such indemnifying  party of
any liability to the indemnified party under this Section 11.

                  (d) The  obligations  of the Company  and  Holders  under this
Section  11  shall  survive  the  completion  of  any  offering  of  Registrable
Securities in a registration statement under this Agreement, and otherwise.

                  12. Reports Under Securities Exchange Act of 1934. With a view
to making  available to the Holders the benefits of Rule 144  promulgated  under
the  Act  and any  other  rule or  regulation  of the  Securities  and  Exchange
Commission ("SEC") that may at any time permit a Holder to sell shares of Common
Stock of the Company to the public without  registration,  the Company agrees to
use commercially reasonable efforts to:

                  (a) whether or not the  Company is  required  to file  reports
required  by Section  13(a) of the 1934 Act,  make and keep  public  information
available,  as those  terms are  understood  and defined in SEC Rule 144, at all
times;

                  (b) file with the SEC in a timely manner all reports and other
documents required of the Company under the Act and the 1934 Act; and

                  (c)  furnish to any  Holder,  so long as the  Holder  owns any
Registrable  Securities,  forthwith upon request (i) a written  statement by the
Company,  if true,  that it has  complied  with the  reporting  requirements  of
Section 13(a) or 15(d) of the 1934 Act, (ii) a copy of the most recent annual or
quarterly report of the Company and such other reports and documents so filed by
the Company  under  Section 13(a) or 15(d) of the 1934 Act, and (iii) such other
information as may be reasonably requested in availing any Holder of any rule or
regulation  of the SEC which permits the selling of any  Registrable  Securities
without registration.

                  13.  Amendment of Registration  Rights.  Any provision of this
Agreement  may be  amended  and the  observance  thereof  may be waived  (either
generally   or  in  a   particular   instance   and  either   retroactively   or
prospectively),  only with the written consent of the Company and the Holders of
a majority of the  Registrable  Securities  then  outstanding.  Any amendment or
waiver  effected in accordance  with this  paragraph  shall be binding upon each
Holder,  each future  Holder,  and the  Company;  provided  that no amendment or
waiver that  materially and adversely  affects the rights of any Holder shall be
effective against such Holder unless such Holder agrees thereto.

                  14.  Notices.  All notices  required or  permitted  under this
Agreement  shall be made in writing  signed by the party making the same,  shall
specify  the section  under this  Agreement  pursuant to which it is given,  and
shall be addressed if to (i) the Company at:  President,  Unigene  Laboratories,
Inc., 110 Little Falls Road,  Fairfield,  New Jersey 07004,  Telephone No. (201)
882-0860,  Telecopy No. (201) 227-6088 and (ii) the Holders at their  respective
addresses on the books of the Company. Any notice,  except as otherwise provided
in this Agreement, shall be made by fax and shall be deemed given at the time of
transmission of the fax.

                  15.  Termination.  This Agreement shall terminate on the later
to occur of (a) the date that is two years from the date of this  Agreement  and
(b)  the  date  any  distribution  of  Registrable  Securities  described  in  a
registration  statement  filed  pursuant to this  Agreement  is  completed;  but
without  prejudice  to (i) the  parties'  rights and  obligations  arising  from
breaches  of this  Agreement  occurring  prior to such  termination  or (ii) the
indemnification obligations under Section 11 of this Agreement.

                  16. Assignment. No assignment, transfer or delegation, whether
by  operation  of law or  otherwise,  of any  rights or  obligations  under this
Agreement by the Company or any Holder, respectively,  shall be made without the
prior written consent of the majority in interest of the Holders or the Company,
respectively;  provided  that the  rights of a Holder  may be  transferred  to a
subsequent  holder  of  the  Holder's  Registrable   Securities  (provided  such
transferee  shall  provide  to the  Company,  together  with  or  prior  to such
transferee's  request to have such Registrable  Securities  included in a Demand
Registration or Piggyback  Registration,  a writing  executed by such transferee
agreeing to be bound as a Holder by the terms of this  Agreement);  and provided
further  that the Company may  transfer  its rights and  obligations  under this
Agreement to a purchaser of all or a substantial  portion of its business if the
obligations of the Company under this  Agreement are assumed in connection  with
such  transfer,  either by merger or other  operation  of law (which may include
without  limitation  a  transaction  whereby  the  Registrable   Securities  are
converted  into  securities  of  the  successor  in  interest)  or  by  specific
assumption executed by the transferee.

                  17. Governing Law. This Registration Rights Agreement shall be
governed by and construed in  accordance  with the laws of the State of Delaware
applicable  to   agreements   made  in  and  wholly  to  be  performed  in  that
jurisdiction,  except for matters  arising under the Act or the 1934 Act,  which
matters shall be construed and  interpreted  in accordance  with such laws.  Any
action brought to enforce,  or otherwise arising out of, this Agreement shall be
heard and determined only in a federal court sitting in the county of New Castle
in the State of Delaware.

         IN WITNESS  WHEREOF,  the undersigned  have executed this  Registration
Rights Agreement as of the date first above written.

AMENDMENT TO LOAN AGREEMENT AND SECURITY AGREEMENT


         This Amendment to Loan Agreement and Security  Agreement  ("Amendment")
made this 29th day of June,  1995 by and between Unigene  Laboratories,  Inc., a
Delaware  corporation  authorized to do business in the State of New Jersey (the
"Borrower") with offices at 110 Little Falls Road, Fairfield, New Jersey and Jay
Levy,  Warren P. Levy and Ronald S. Levy, all with offices located at 110 Little
Falls Road, Fairfield, New Jersey, individually (jointly the "Lender").
         WHEREAS,  the parties have previously entered into a Loan Agreement and
a Security Agreement both dated March 2, 1995 pursuant to which Lender loaned to
Borrower  certain sums not to exceed at any time the amount of  $500,000.00  and
Borrower granted to Lender a security interest in certain  collateral located in
premises known as 83 Fulton Street,  Boonton,  New Jersey leased by the Borrower
as particularly  described therein (the "Collateral"),  which Loan Agreement and
Security Agreement have been amended by the Borrower and the Lender by Amendment
to Loan  Agreement  and  Security  Agreement  dated  March 20,  1995 (the  "Loan
Agreement" and the "Security Agreement"; and
         WHEREAS,  Lender  has  previously  loaned  to  Borrower  the  amount of
$255,000.00 in addition to amounts loaned  pursuant to the Loan Agreement and is
unwilling  to lend to Borrower  any  additional  sums unless and until  Borrower
grants to Lender a security  interest in the  Collateral to secure the repayment
of all such additional loans including the prior loan of $255,000.00; and
         WHEREAS,  Borrower  desires to arrange for additional  borrowings  from
Lender in the amount not to exceed $445,000.00; and

         NOW,  THEREFORE,  in  consideration  of  the  mutual  covenants  herein
contained and other good and valuable consideration,  receipt of which is hereby
acknowledged, the parties agree as follows.
1.       ADVANCES
         The term  "Loan" as that term is set  forth in the Loan  Agreement  and
Security Agreement shall be revised to reflect the $500,000.00 borrowing ("Prior
Loan") and the additional  borrowing of $255,000.00  and subsequent  loans in an
amount not to exceed at any time  $445,000.00  (the total of (X) $255,000.00 and
(Y) $445,000.00 being herein referred to as the "New Loan".)
         a. The New Loan  shall be and is hereby  made  subject to the terms and
conditions  of  the  Loan  Agreement,   and,  provided  no  event  or  condition
constituting  a default or an event of default has  occurred,  Lender shall lend
and re-lend to Borrower from time to time until the  termination  date,  amounts
which  shall  not  exceed at any one time in the  aggregate  the New Loan in the
principal amount of Seven Hundred Thousand ($700,000.00) Dollars.
         b.  Advances of the New Loan shall be made to the  Borrower  under this
Agreement and delivered to the Borrower by check payable to the Borrower or wire
transfer of funds for credit to any general  deposit  account  maintained by the
Borrower, as the Borrower may reasonably direct.
         c. The Borrower  acknowledges  receipt pursuant to this Agreement prior
to the date hereof of sums  totalling Two Hundred Fifty Five Thousand and 00/100
($255,000.00)  dollars,  which  advances have been made pursuant to the terms of
this  Agreement  and  shall  be  evidenced  by the  Promissory  Note to be given
pursuant hereunder.

indebtedness with regard to the premises which the undersigned owns and in which

         4.  Any  notice  provisions  contained  in the  Loan  Agreement  or the
Security Agreement shall also apply hereunder.
         5. Presentment, dishonor and notice of dishonor are hereby waived.
         6. Upon nonpayment of this Note at its stated or accelerated  maturity,
the Lender  may,  in  addition  to such other and  further  rights and  remedies
provided by law, or by the Security Agreement referred to above:
                  (a)  collect  interest  from the date of such  maturity on the
principal balance owing hereon at the interest rate(s) set forth herein;
                  (b) hold as security for the payment hereof any other property

         7. If the  Lender  of the Note has not  received  the  full  amount  of
payment of interest due by the end of the ten (10)  calendar days after the date

shall be immediately  due and payable,  which charge shall be for the purpose of
defraying  expenses incident to handling such delinquent  payments.  This charge
shall be in addition  to, and not in lieu of, any other  remedy  Lender may have
and is in addition to Lender's right to collect  reasonable  fees and charges of
any agents or attorneys  which Lender employs in connection with any non-payment
or other event of default.  Acceptance by the Lender of payment of a late charge
shall in no way be  considered  to be an  election  of remedies or waiver by the
Lender of rights at law or under this Note, or the Security Agreement. Such late
charges if not previously paid shall become part of the  indebtedness  evidenced
hereby,  and shall,  at the option of the  Lender,  be added t o any  succeeding
monthly payment due under this Note.  Failure to pay such late charges with such
succeeding  monthly  payment shall  constitute an event of default and such late
charges shall bear  interest at the default rate as hereafter  provided from the
date due.
         8.  Upon the  occurrence  of an event of  default  (including,  without
limitation,  the failure of Borrower to pay any sum herein  specified when due),
the unpaid  principal  sum  evidenced by this Note together with all accrued and
unpaid interest thereon, and all other sums evidenced and/or secured by the Note
and the Security  Agreement,  Loan Agreement and other loan  documents  given in
connection  herewith  shall bear interest at a rate per annum referred to as the
Default  Rate,  which  shall be equal to a lesser  of: (x) the  highest  rate of
interest  permitted to be contracted for under the laws of the State, or (y) the
interest rate first set forth plus five (5%) percent per annum. The Default Rate
shall be in lieu of any  other  interest  rate  otherwise  applicable  and shall
commence,  without notice,  immediately upon and from the occurrence of any such
event of default  effective  as of the due date of the  payment  in default  and
shall  continue  until all  defaults are cured and all sums then due and payable
under the Note and other loan documents are paid in full.
         9. Borrower shall have the right to prepay this Note in full or in part
at any time.
         10.  If this  Note is  referred  to an  attorney  for  collection,  the
Undersigned agrees that reasonable attorney's fees shall be added to such amount
and shall be payable thereon.
         11.  This  Note is  binding  on the  Undersigned,  its  successors  and
assigns.
         12. If there are any inconsistencies  between the Note and the Security
Agreement, the terms of the Security Agreement shall prevail.

         IN WITNESS WHEREOF,  the Undersigned has executed this Note on the date
first above written.

                          INDEPENDENT AUDITORS' CONSENT





The Board of Directors
Unigene Laboratories, Inc.:



We consent to  incorporation  by reference in the  Registration  Statements (No.
33-18890  and the  Registration  Statement  filed March 22, 1996) on Form S-8 of
Unigene  Laboratories,  Inc. of our report dated March 22, 1996, relating to the
balance sheets of Unigene  Laboratories,  Inc. as of December 31, 1995 and 1994,
and the related statements of operations,  stockholders'  equity, and cash flows
for each of the years in the three-year  period ended  December 31, 1995,  which
report  appears in the December  31, 1995 annual  report on Form 10-K of Unigene
Laboratories, Inc.

Our report dated March 22, 1996 contains an  explanatory  paragraph  that states
that the Company has suffered  recurring  losses from  operations  and has a net
working capital  deficiency,  which raise substantial doubt about its ability to
continue  as a going  concern.  The  financial  statements  do not  include  any
adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty.
