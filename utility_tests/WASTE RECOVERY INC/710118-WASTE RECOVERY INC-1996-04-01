ITEM 1.  BUSINESS

General
- -------

Waste Recovery,  Inc. (the Company or Registrant)  is a specialized  service
and process  company  operating  in the  environmental  services  industry.  The
Company is involved in all aspects of scrap tire  disposal and in  conversion of
scrap  tires,  through a  proprietary  process,  into a uniform,  high  quality,
wire-free, tire-derived fuel (TDF).

The Company believes it is the largest firm in the United States specializing in
disposal  and  recycling  of scrap tires into a high  quality  fuel  supplement.
Presently,  the Company has TDF  producing  facilities  operating  in  Portland,
Oregon; Houston,  Texas; Atlanta,  Georgia and Philadelphia,  Pennsylvania.  The
Company  is  a  partner  in  a   partnership,   Waste   Recovery-Illinois   (the
Partnership),   which  completed  the  construction  of  two  tire-derived  fuel
processing  facilities in Marseilles,  Illinois and Dupo, Illinois (the Illinois
Partnership  Facilities)  during  1995.  As  of  March  21,  1995,  the  Company
established  operations in the  Northeastern  United States (see  acquisition of
Domino Salvage, Tire Division, Inc. (Domino) below in this Item 1, Business).

The Company was  organized  in 1982 to acquire the assets of two  operations  in
Portland,  Oregon,  one of which had been  producing TDF since 1976. The Houston
facility began producing TDF in 1986, the Atlanta operation in 1988, and the two
Illinois  facilities  became  operational  in late  1995.  After the March  1995
acquisition  of Domino and the  addition of  specific,  proprietary,  processing
equipment, Domino began producing a quality TDF in late 1995.

The Company has made  investments in facilities  and developed  expertise in the
area of tire  disposal.  The system is  flexible in order to serve as a disposal
service for scrap tire sources ranging from current scrap tire generators,  such
as tire  dealers,  all the way to large,  sometimes  long-abandoned,  scrap tire
piles.  Scrap  tire  pick-up  service  must be  regular  and on a time  schedule
sufficiently  predictable in order to minimize the storage  requirements  of the
scrap tire generators and to provide continuity of supply to TDF users.

The Company  uses its tire  shredding  equipment  and  handling  systems for the
production of a high grade TDF. In addition to improving  systems and equipment,
the  Company  has  worked  to make TDF  more  acceptable  as a fuel  supplement.
Generally,  the permitting process required before a utility or other industrial
fuel user may start burning TDF is a process that depends on many factors,  such
as the location, the volumes, the traditional fuels being supplemented, types of
burners,  boilers and fuel handling systems.  The Company uses its experience in
the TDF supplement  business to help customers obtain permits and to equip their
facilities to most efficiently use TDF as a fuel supplement.

Waste  Recovery  pursues  an  integrated  approach  to scrap tire  disposal  and
conversion of scrap tires into TDF and works to increase the total number of TDF
users in order to increase  demand for the  Company's  TDF.  The Company has not
historically had a significant amount of backlog orders for TDF.

The Company's  TDF competes  against a different  mix of  traditional  fuels and
electric  power  sources  in  various  regions of the  country.  In the  Pacific
Northwest,  industry is served by  hydroelectric  systems that provide  electric
power at a low enough rate that fossil fuel burning  co-generation power systems
are not justified at industrial  plants.  Thus, the pulp and paper mills typical
of this region require fuel  essentially for the production of heat and steam to
be used in their manufacturing process. Much of this fuel is provided from their
own "Hog Fuel," or wood waste from the logging, debarking and sawing operations.
TDF is a well-suited  supplement to this internally  generated fuel,  especially
during the winter and spring months when waste wood fuel is wet.

In the Southwest,  TDF competes with natural gas as a supplemental fuel in steam
generation  facilities.  Despite  natural gas being  relatively  inexpensive  in
recent years,  the Company's  business in this region has continued to grow. The
increasing  need  to  dispose  of  abandoned  tire  piles,  coupled  with  WRI's
participation  in the Texas  Waste  Tire  Recycling  Program,  suggests  further
improvement in the future.
                                        1
<PAGE>

The pulp and paper industries in the Southeast  typically require a much greater
proportion of on-site  generated  power because they generate much more of their
own electric power.  Since the bulk of this power is  traditionally  coal-based,
TDF is well-suited as a competitive  energy source in the region,  primarily due
to the fact that TDF's handling and burning  characteristics  are the closest to
coal.

The Company's 45% ownership interest in the two Illinois Partnership  Facilities
will  strengthen  the  Company's  position  as one of the  nation's  largest TDF
producers.  These  plants  are  the  first  of the  Company's  plants  that  are
economically  justified due solely to having traditional,  coal burning electric
utilities as the primary recipients of the TDF plants' output.

On March 21, 1995, the Company  purchased all of the outstanding stock of Domino
Salvage,  Tire Division,  Inc., a scrap tire recycler  located in  Conshohocken,
Pennsylvania  near  Philadelphia  that has been in business  since 1988.  Andrew
Sabia,  former  President  of  Domino,  is  managing  Domino  and the  Company's
Northeastern   operations.   The  Company  invested  approximately  $500,000  in
improvements  during  1995  to  increase  the  facility's  capacity.  Management
believes that the existing  market presence and position of Domino in the region
will facilitate the Company's expansion into the promising Northeastern markets.


Operations
- ----------

The Company  receives scrap tires and processes  them into TDF. In general,  the
TDF production  process  consists of conveying whole tires to a primary shredder
which cuts them into thin strips.  These strips are  processed  into a chip form
and then run across a  magnetic  separator  to remove  most of the bead wire and
steel belting. The resulting product is a chip of rubber compound nominally less
than  two  inches  in any  dimension  and 98%  free of  bead  wire.  Most of the
processing   equipment  by  which  scrap  tires  are   converted  to  a  quality
tire-derived fuel has been designed or extensively modified by the Company's own
technical  people.  The  Company  continually  endeavors  to improve its process
economics and product  quality.  During the first  quarter of 1996,  the Company
installed a new wire  recycling  system at its  Baytown,  Texas  facility.  This
system,  designed and  manufactured  by the Company,  will allow the facility to
operate  waste-free,  significantly  improving its profit  margins.  Two similar
systems will be installed during 1996 in the Atlanta and Portland facilities.

Since 1982, the Company has been refining and improving its  production  process
and has  improved  tire  shredding  techniques,  equipment  durability,  and the
process  for removal of most of the steel wire in scrap  tires.  The Company has
developed  proprietary  metering devices for use by TDF customers to control the
flow  of TDF as a fuel  supplement  to  maximize  TDF  utilization  within  each
customer's particular  requirements and the framework of existing  environmental
constraints.

The Company's four scrap tire  processing  plants  received more than 12 million
scrap tires for  shredding  in 1995.  Many of these  casings  were  delivered by
independent  operators.  The Company is not dependent on any single supplier for
scrap tires.  No one  independent  collector  accounted  for more than 5% of the
casings  processed by the Company during 1995.  Most of the casings are obtained
through the Company's own collection network,  which collects from retail stores
or supplies  trailers to major scrap tire generators,  and through  arrangements
with tire  manufacturers  for factory  defectives.  The  Goodyear  Tire & Rubber
Company disposed of approximately 700,000 casings with the Company, or less than
6% of all casings received in 1995.

A continued contributor to growth in 1995 was a large tire abatement project for
the  State  of  West  Virginia.  This  project  has  involved  the  clean-up  of
approximately  two million  scrap tires at an  abandoned  tire site near Inwood,
West  Virginia,  which  accounted  for 21% of 1995  revenues.  This  project was
completed in the first quarter of 1996. TDF sales  accounted for 7%, 9%, and 13%
of total company revenues for 1995, 1994 and 1993,  respectively.  Tipping fees,
hauling  and other  services  accounted  for 93%,  91% and 81% of total  Company
revenues for 1995, 1994 and 1993, respectively.


Seasonality
- -----------

Given its origins in the Pacific  Northwest,  the Company's TDF sales volume has
traditionally been seasonal,  with volume diminishing  between June and November
of each year when the major customers in that region, pulp and paper mills, need
less fuel  supplementation than in the winter and spring months when their waste
wood fuel is wet.

The Company believes the  Partnership's  five-year  contract with Illinois Power
Company  for the sale of 60,000 tons per year of TDF, as well as its own growing
client base in the South and Southeast,  will help dampen seasonal  fluctuations
over the foreseeable future.


Scrap-Tire Market
- -----------------

The  tire  manufacturing  industry  estimates  that  approximately  315  million
passenger tire equivalents (PTE's) (equivalent to approximately 225 million tire
units) were scrapped in 1995.

In recent years,  the average yield in the TDF process has been a ton of product
from  approximately  130  PTE's.  Thus,  if all  tires  scrapped  in a year were
converted to TDF, the potential output would be close to 2.4 million tons - more
than 30 times the Company's  1995 tonnage sales of TDF. Even after  allowing for
the 15% of tires scrapped  annually that are used in other  applications,  it is
apparent that scrap tire supply,  in general,  should not have a limiting effect
on the Company's ability to continue its growth for the foreseeable future. This
calculation does not take into account the additional "raw material" represented
by the "tire  piles"  which  further  increase the  potential  TDF output.  Tire
Business, a leading industry publication,  reported last year that approximately
800 million discarded scrap tires are in stockpiles around the U.S.

Demand for TDF is growing,  especially in the utility  industry.  High BTUs, low
cost, and reduced sulfur emissions have contributed to increased TDF utilization
by  electric  power  generating   facilities.   Management  believes  there  are
continuing  opportunities  to increase demand for this fuel. One example of this
is the recent agreement with the Illinois Power Company.  Under the terms of the
contract with the Illinois Partnership,  the Illinois Power Company will burn up
to 7.5 million reprocessed tires, or 60,000 tons of TDF, per year at its Baldwin
Power Station (Baldwin).  This figure,  which constitutes about 60% of the tires
annually  discarded in  Illinois,  equates to only 2% of the energy needs at the
Baldwin plant.


Government Regulation
- ---------------------

The Company  works within a network of  government  regulations  and programs at
both the scrap tire supply side and the TDF supply side of the business.  Due to
the recognized fire and health hazards associated with stockpiles of scrap tires
and the desire to curtail additional growth of stockpiles,  stricter regulations
with respect to the disposal of current  take-off tires have been implemented at
all levels of jurisdiction with increasing intensity in recent years.

                                       3
<PAGE>

In the past couple of years,  legislation  has had a  significant  effect on the
Company's  Houston  operation.  The  State  of  Texas  collects  $2 for each new
passenger  tire and  $3.50 for each  truck  tire  sold.  The  proceeds  fund the
clean-up of abandoned tire piles, as well as the disposal of current  take-offs,
and are the  source of the $.85 per  weighted  tire  unit  (18.7  lbs.)  paid to
licensed and registered scrap tire processors.  The Company was one of the first
processors  registered in 1992,  and the only  processor in the state to recycle
all of the scrap tires it has received under the program.  The Company was under
the State of Texas'  allocation  program until September 1995, at which time the
allocation  system was revoked and now allows  qualified  processors  to process
tires on an unlimited basis.

The  burning  of TDF is  subject  to  regulation  by  federal,  state  and local
governments.   Generally,  the  Company  and  its  customers  must  comply  with
established mandatory disposal regulations and safety guidelines.  TDF customers
must comply  with  certain  emissions  and ash  content  standards  and with the
requirements of the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency and certain portions of
the Clean Air Act. It is anticipated  that initial permit  applications  for TDF
burns in new states will be  thoroughly  scrutinized  by  regulatory  bodies for
emission  standards  and ash  content  compliance.  The  Company  has  developed
historical  information  from its  current  customer  base,  as well as from the
numerous  trial burns it has been  associated  with,  that  provides a potential
advantage in working with customers in their contacts with regulatory agencies.


Competition
- -----------

The  scrap  tire   disposal  and  recycling   industry  is  highly   fragmented.
Participants  include  the  divisions  of a few large  companies  and many small
operators who, for the most part,  either  stockpile tires or shred and landfill
them.  One of the largest  collectors and processors of scrap tires into fuel on
the East Coast is Emanuel Tire Company in Baltimore,  Maryland.  Archer  Daniels
Midland Company of Decatur,  Illinois,  one of the largest scrap tire processors
in Illinois, processes tires it receives into supplemental fuel for its own use.

In the Southwest,  the  implementation  of legislation in Texas in 1992 fostered
the  establishment  of  approximately  20 new  tire  processors.  Many of  these
processors are still active,  but recently,  several laws have been  implemented
that provide that (i) as of  September 1, 1995,  limitations  are removed on the
number of PTE's that the  Company  can  process  and  receive  payment  for on a
monthly  basis and,  (ii) as of January 1, 1996,  only tire  processors  with an
end-use market may qualify for reimbursement from the State of Texas. These laws
place  pressure  on the  Company's  competitors  to produce  and market a better
quality tire chip than is required by current State of Texas specifications. The
Company is the only  processor  in Texas to have  marketed  all  material it has
processed and feels that with the  increased  liability of the State of Texas of
growing shred piles produced by other  processors,  it should  ultimately gain a
stronger position in the market for tire procurement and increased processing.

Browning  Ferris  Industries,  Inc.  ("BFI")  entered the scrap tire  processing
business through the acquisition of Maust Tire Recyclers of Savage, Minnesota in
1991.  BFI,  headquartered  in  Houston,  Texas,  is one of  the  largest  waste
disposers in the United  States and operates tire  processing  facilities in the
states of Illinois, Minnesota and Georgia.

The Company's  primary  competition  for the  acquisition  of scrap tire casings
comes from the companies  mentioned  above and numerous  individual  collectors.
Several  programs  for the use of whole tires as  supplemental  fuel in electric
power plants are underway with utility companies around the country.

The  Company  recognizes  that its  operations  and  expansions  are and will be
subject to competition  from other  companies,  some of whom have  substantially
greater financial,  marketing, research and development, and personnel resources
than the Company.  However, the Company believes that it can effectively compete
on the  basis  of its  expertise  in the  logistics  of  tire  disposal  and TDF
production technology.  The Partnership's  newly-constructed Illinois TDF plants
will incorporate  process equipment design  modifications that improve operating
efficiency  as  compared  with the  original  Portland  operation.  The  Company
believes  that its  processing  costs and  reliability  are  better  than  those
achievable  by  competitors   using   commercially   available  tire  processing
equipment.

The Company's  service mark "Making  Waste a Resource" was federally  registered
with the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office on July 5, 1983. The patents set forth
in the foregoing tables afford some protection in the areas in which the Company
intends to  concentrate.  Management  believes,  however,  that its know-how and
regular  improvements  to equipment and procedures are equally  important in the
waste-to-energy business.

In 1988, pursuant to its industrial  development bond financing for construction
of the Atlanta  plant,  the Company  licensed  its  technology,  including  such
patents, to the indenture trustee. In 1993, the Company licensed such technology
to the Illinois  Partnership  in  connection  with the  construction  of the two
facilities in Illinois.


Employees
- ---------

As of December 31, 1995, the Company and the Illinois  Partnership  together had
200  full-time  employees,  of whom 175 were in  operations  and the  balance in
administration,  sales,  planning and  engineering.  None of the  employees  are
covered by  collective  bargaining  agreements,  and the  Company  believes  its
relations with its employees are good.

shares were  delisted as a result of the  Company's  failure to meet  applicable
capital and surplus  requirements.  The following  table sets forth the range of

     cumulative  preferred  stock.  Prior to payment of a dividend on its common
     stock,  all dividends  cumulated on such preferred  stock must be paid. The
     Company  does not  anticipate  paying  dividends on its common stock in the
     foreseeable future.


Conversion of Partnership Interest
- ----------------------------------

Effective January 1, 1994, the partners of KCT Associates, Ltd. (KCT) effected
the conversion of their limited partnership interest in Waste Recovery Partners,
Ltd.  (the  Partnership)  into  unregistered  common stock of the Company,  as
provided  for  in  the  KCT  limited  partnership  agreement,  as  amended.  The
Partnership  was formed in 1991 to provide  needed cash to the Company in return
for a preferential return on the cash investment,  35% of the Company's Portland
operation's  net  profits,  and  conversion   privileges  which  now  have  been
exercised. During the period that the Partnership was in effect, the Company, as
the general  partner,  continued as the manager of the  Partnership and received
management  and incentive  fees, as well as 65% of net operating  profits of the
Company's Portland operation after payment of the preferential return on the KCT
investment.  In addition to the conversions referenced above, certain principals
of KCT  exercised  a warrant  and a stock  option to purchase a total of 325,000
shares of common  stock  which  were  granted  pursuant  to  financial  advisors
agreements entered into in 1991 and 1993.  Pursuant to the conversions,  and the
warrant and option exercises,  the Company issued 2,985,323  unregistered shares
of common stock under these agreements in 1994.

On February  17,  1994,  the Company  announced  that it received a Schedule 13D
whereby a group, comprised in part of certain affiliates of KCT and representing
approximately  35% of the  outstanding  common  stock,  had entered into an oral
agreement with respect to the voting and transfer of such stock.

Rights Offering
- ---------------

The Company  distributed  nontransferable  subscription rights (the Rights) to
subscribe  for an  aggregate  of  3,238,857  shares of its  common  stock for an
offering price of $0.75 per share (the  "Subscription  Price") to the holders of
record of the  common  stock at the  close of  business  on April 14,  1995 (the
"Record Date"), and to certain holders of the Company's convertible  debentures,
provided that on or before June 7, 1995 (the  "Conversion  Date") such debenture
holders  converted the debentures to common stock  (collectively,  the "Eligible
Shareholders").  The Eligible  Shareholders received in this offering two Rights
for each five shares of common  stock held on the Record Date or the  Conversion
Date.  Each Right entitled the holder to subscribe for and purchase one share of
common stock upon payment of the  Subscription  Price.  Each Right also entitled
the holder to subscribe for additional  shares of common stock available in this
offering that were not subscribed  and paid for by other  Eligible  Stockholders
under the basic subscription privilege.

At the  conclusion of the Rights  offering on June 26, 1995,  the full amount of
the  subscription  had been  exercised;  3,238,857  shares of common  stock were
issued and $2.2  million  in capital  was  raised  which has been  utilized  for
specific  equipment  improvements and working  capital.  In conjunction with the
offering,  $265,000  plus  accrued  interest  of  $17,951  of  the  convertible,
subordinated  debentures  were  converted  at the rate of $0.875  per share into
323,373 shares of common stock.

ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S  DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS
        OF OPERATIONS

The Company  owns and  operates  plants in  Portland,  Oregon;  Houston,  Texas;
Atlanta, Georgia and Philadelphia,  Pennsylvania.  During 1993 and until January
10, 1994, the Portland  facility was owned by Waste Recovery  Partners,  Ltd., a
limited  partnership,  of which the Company  had a 65%  ownership  position  and
served as the managing partner. Late in 1994,  construction began in central and
southern  Illinois on two new tire processing  plants which began  operations in
late 1995.  These  plants are owned by the  Illinois  Partnership,  of which the
Company  owns a 45%  interest  and is  the  managing  partner.  The  Company  is
operating the Illinois  Partnership  Facilities in close  coordination  with the
rest of its national  system and is expanding its presence in this region of the
United States.

Regional  services are coordinated  from the operating  bases  mentioned  above.
Operations encompass full-service scrap tire disposal and the recycling of tires
into a supplemental  fuel form. The Company  generates  revenues from scrap tire
disposal  fees,  hauling of scrap tires and from the sale of TDF. At the plants,
scrap tires are  converted  and refined into TDF, a high BTU  supplemental  fuel
that is sold primarily to major domestic cement and paper manufacturers. The TDF
output of the Illinois facilities will initially be dedicated to use in electric
power generating boilers of Illinois Power Company.

To date,  the  effects  of  inflation  on the  Company's  operations  have  been
negligible.


General Comments
- ----------------

The  Company  experienced  significant  growth  during  1995  as its  production
capabilities  increased from 20 million passenger tire equivalents  ("PTE's") to
40  million  PTE's.  This  growth  did come at a cost,  as is  reflected  in the
Company's financial results for the year. The increase in capacity came from two
areas,  (i) the  acquisition  of Domino and, (ii) the  establishment  of the two
facilities in Illinois.

With the  acquisition  of Domino  in the  first  quarter  of 1995,  the  Company
committed to restructure and rebuild  Domino's  facility and equipment to enable
it to produce a quality  TDF.  Although  the  capital  improvements  were funded
through the Rights  offering,  the time spent in rebuilding  the plant  severely
hindered the earnings capacity of the plant. The rebuild of Domino was completed
in late 1995,  but did not allow  sufficient  time to make up for lost  business
before year end.  Domino was also  affected  by a downturn in the tire  disposal
market as competitors in the Northeast drove down prices by receiving tires at a
rate  significantly  less than that  received in the  beginning of 1995 and past
years.  Likewise, the TDF market has decreased in the Northeast as several major
consumers either temporarily  stopped or reduced their utilization of TDF. These
factors together  generated a loss from this wholly owned subsidiary of $382,514
for the period from March 21, 1995 through December 31, 1995.

The Company's 45% interest in the Illinois Partnership generated a $322,630 loss
for the year ended  December 31,  1995.  Most of 1995 was spent  completing  the
construction of the two Illinois  facilities at Dupo and  Marseilles,  Illinois.
Completion was originally scheduled before the summer of 1995, but due to a late
start in 1994,  followed by problematic  weather in the Spring of 1995 and other
construction  hold-ups,  the facilities  were not finished until September 1995.
This late entry into the scrap tire  market and the coming of the winter  months
severely hampered marketing efforts.  The final months of the year were spent in
tire  procurement  and producing TDF from the 1,000,000 tires that were received
by the two plants,  over  800,000 of which were in Dupo.  The revenue  generated
from the disposal of tires and the  production  and sale of TDF and wire was not
enough to overcome the operating and other overhead  costs incurred  during this
period of start-up and initial market development.  Further  contributing to the
Partnership's  loss is over $438,000 of  depreciation  and  amortization  of the
property, plants and equipment, and bond issuance and preoperating costs.

The losses as discussed above total over $700,000, which comprises approximately
76% of the  Company's  net  loss for the  year  ended  December  31,  1995.  The
remaining  24% of the loss was caused by  various  factors  also  related to the
pressures  of growth and  specifically,  the effect on the Baytown  plant of the
Texas Tire Program's allocation process which, until September 1995, limited the
monthly amount of revenue that could be generated therefrom. Higher depreciation
amounts  from the  rebuild  of the  Baytown  plant in 1994 and the  overhaul  of
certain equipment at the Company's Atlanta facility during 1995 also contributed
to the loss.

                                       12
<PAGE>

The  Company  received  $750,000  from  the gain on sale of  equipment  from the
Illinois partnership in 1995 which was earned upon the successful  completion of
the Illinois  Partnership  Facilities within the defined budget. Of this amount,
$412,500 was  recognized in other income in 1995,  with the  remaining  $337,500
recorded as deferred revenue which will be recognized in income over the term of
the lives of the related capitalized property and equipment of the Partnership.

The West Virginia tire abatement project continued to contribute to the earnings
of the Company during 1995,  although shut-down for the summer months. This tire
pile  clean-up of two million  tires was  completed in February  1996 and proved
very profitable to the Company over its two-year term.

The income tax benefit recorded in 1994 for the gain on equipment ($750,000,  as
noted  above) and certain  other items was  effectively  utilized  during  1995.
However,  due to the overall loss of the Company during 1995, the tax expense is
not  recognized  in 1995.  The  benefit  of this  deferred  tax asset is the net
operating  loss  carry-forward   available  to  the  Company  in  future  years.
Therefore,  after  reclassifying  $447,543 as a  noncurrent  asset in 1995,  its
ultimate use is expected to be realized over the two-year period ending December
31, 1997.

The losses  from the Domino  plant and  Illinois  Partnership  during  1995 were
substantial and are primarily due to operations  hindered by construction and to
the late start-up, respectively. The Waste Recovery plants have identified their
problem areas and appear to be back on track for 1996. It is management's belief
that although an immediate  turnaround is not expected,  the initial  burdens of
new  growth  are  beginning  to  subside  as  increased  tire flow at all of the
facilities,  additional TDF customers and a more visible market position provide
the  Company  with  the  impetus  to  catch up with its  growth  and  return  to
profitibility.

A recap of the Company's operating results before income taxes is as follows:

</TABLE>

Total revenues for 1995 at $14,140,000 are $1,715,000 higher than 1994 revenues,
representing a 14% increase.  Total revenues for 1994 were more than  $3,685,000
or 42% over the $8,740,000 level obtained in 1993. Thus,  revenues  increased by
over 60% in the last two years and by the end of 1996, capacity at the plants is
expected to provide further increases in revenues.

The  average  price per ton of TDF was lower in 1995 than 1994 or 1993,  but the
overall customer base is expanding.  Through the Portland facility,  the Company
also  contributed TDF to engineering and landfill  projects which,  although not
generating  revenue,  avoided  some of the fees that  disposal  would have cost.
Tonnage  of TDF sold in 1995 was  higher  than the 1994 and 1993  levels  as the
Company  continued to develop new markets for its TDF. The lower inventory level
at the 1995  year end is  attributable  to the  larger  market  and focus of the
Company to keep its product turned.

</TABLE>

Depreciation  charges increased  significantly from 1994 to 1995 in dollar terms
due to a 24% addition of property plant and  equipment,  55% of which relates to
the acquisition of Domino.  The percentage  relationship of operating expense to
revenues also was affected by the acquisition of Domino and the lack of revenues
it generated during the period the facility was being rebuilt.  Costs to operate
the Atlanta plant were relatively higher in 1995 due to mechanical problems that
affected its production efficiency.

General,  administrative and interest expense increased  $468,515,  a comparable
increase to the prior year and remains at a comparable  percentage  of revenues.
Interest expense increased due to additional debt from the acquisition of Domino
and the  interest  accrued on the  remaining  convertible  debentures.  Interest
expense comprised 4% of total revenues compared with 3% in 1994 and 4% in 1993.

Liquidity and Capital Resources
- -------------------------------

The operating and net loss from 1995 have required  significant working capital,
but due to the growth generated in late 1994 and the successful  Rights offering
completed in June 1995, the Company maintains a stronger equity position than as
of the end of  1994.  One-third  of the loss  has  been  generated  from the 45%
ownership in the Illinois  Partnership,  therefore this loss is not a direct use
of cash. The Domino facility has used significant cash resources of the Company,
which  had been  partially  anticipated,  and  management  anticipates  improved
performance  at Domino in 1996 as the plant  became  fully  operational  in late
1995.

Management  remains  sensitive  to the risks that the Company  will not have the
financial strength to take advantage of opportunities that are developing. It is
anticipated  that if operating  results  stabilize in 1996,  the Company will be
able to adequately fund its working capital  requirements  for at least the next
twelve months.  Capital  expenditures for 1996 are expected to be lower than the
past two years as all of the plants' machinery and equipment are in good working
order, and the wire  reclamation  systems are in the process of being installed.
These two factors should reduce operating costs.  However,  to capitalize on the
substantial  growth that has  developed  over the past year,  the  Company  will
continue to explore ways to improve its financial position.

Capital expenditures totaled $1,680,000 in 1995. Other than construction outlays
at the  plant  sites in  Illinois,  where  expenditures  are on the books of the
Partnership  rather than the  Company,  the largest  amounts  were at the Domino
plant for its rebuild and the Atlanta  plant for the rework and  replacement  of
several  major  pieces of  machinery.  The  Portland  plant  also had its annual
maintenance  overhaul,  and over thirty  trailers  were  purchased to handle the
increased  tire  flow  coming  into  the  plants.  The  Company's  strategy  for
operations  and growth  continues to be based on continuous  improvement in both
process and logistical  equipment,  control of production  costs,  and increased
marketing of TDF and reclaimed wire.

The Company's working capital balance at December 31, 1995 was $237,503. This is
the second time in five years that management has been able to report a positive
working capital balance. The favorable prospects for growth have been convincing
arguments for management to use in achieving  re-negotiation of the terms of the
Domino  debt  in  March  1996,   the  exchange  of  the  remaining   convertible
subordinated  debentures  in  March  1996,  and  a  lower  interest  rate  on  a
significant portion of the Company's term debt.

The  Domino  debt has been  modified  to extend  the  first  annual  payment  of
$200,000,  which was due March 21,  1996,  to  twelve  equal  monthly  principal
installments of $16,666 beginning September 21, 1996.

Effective March 15, 1996, convertible  subordinated  debentures in the amount of
$410,000 have been exchanged for  debentures  with an interest rate of 18% which
will mature on January 31, 1997, with the original conversion rate of $0.875 per
share.

In February 1996, the Company  switched  financial  institutions and was able to
secure  a  preferred  interest  rate of prime  less .5% on its term  note in the
amount of $1.1 million, which remains guaranteed by the Goodyear Tire and Rubber
Company.

These modified debt  agreements will allow the Company to better manage its cash
flow to match the revenue stream.

Management believes that the 1995 results reflect the initial burden of starting
the Illinois facilities, acquiring Domino and restructuring its facility, and an
active,  competitive market.  Debt service charges and depreciation  continue to
increase annually as the Company  experiences high growth.  However,  management
still believes that the Company's  operating  strategies are on the right track,
and they continue to have confidence in the future potential for the Company.

                              WASTE RECOVERY, INC.

                   Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements

                                December 31, 1995


(1) SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES
    ------------------------------------------

    (a)   Organization and Operations

          Waste Recovery,  Inc. (the Company or WRI) is a tire recovery  company
          that  specializes  in  processing  scrap  tires  into a  refined  fuel
          supplement more commonly  referred to as tire-derived  fuel (TDF). The
          Company  generates  income from the sale of TDF and from  tipping fees
          charged for the disposal of tires.

          The  Company  is  incorporated  in the  State  of  Texas  and  has its
          headquarters in Dallas,  Texas.  The operating plants are in Portland,
          Oregon;   Houston,   Texas;   Atlanta,   Georgia;   and  Conshohocken,
          Pennsylvania.

          The Company entered into an agreement as of November 29, 1993, to form
          a joint  venture  in a  partnership,  Waste  Recovery -  Illinois,  an
          Illinois general partnership (Illinois partnership), in which it has a
          45%  ownership   interest.   Riverside  Caloric  Company,  an  Indiana
          corporation, has a 55% ownership in this Illinois partnership.

          On March 21, 1995, the Company acquired 100% of the outstanding  stock
          of  Domino  Salvage,  Tire  Division,  Inc.  (Domino),  a  scrap  tire
          recycling company located in Conshohocken,  Pennsylvania,  a suburb of
          Philadelphia (see note 2).

    (b)   Principles of Consolidation

          For 1995, the consolidated  financial statements include the financial
          statements of Domino  Salvage,  Tire  Division,  Inc., a  wholly-owned
          subsidiary of the Company,  which was purchased on March 21, 1995 (see
          note 2).  The  1995  consolidated  financial  statements  include  the
          operations  of Domino for the period March 21, 1995  through  December
          31, 1995.

          For 1993, the consolidated financial statements included the financial
          statements of Waste Recovery,  Inc. and Waste Recovery Partners,  Ltd.
          in which the  Company  owned a 65%  interest.  References  in the 1993
          consolidated  financial statements to minority interest pertain to the
          other 35% owner (see note 13).

          Effective  January 1, 1994,  the limited  partners  of Waste  Recovery
          Partners,  Ltd. converted their limited partnership interests into 2.6
          million   unregistered  shares  of  WRI  common  stock.  Due  to  this
          conversion,  the operations of Waste Recovery  Partners,  Ltd.  became
          wholly-owned  by  the  Company.   The  1994   consolidated   financial
          statements reflect the operations of the combined entities.

                                      F-8
<PAGE>

          All  significant  intercompany  balances  and  transactions  have been
          eliminated in consolidation.  The Company's investment in and earnings
          or losses  from Waste  Recovery - Illinois  are  accounted  for by the
          equity method (see note 9).

          The  preparation of financial  statements in conformity with generally
          accepted  accounting  principles requires management to make estimates
          and  assumptions  that  affect  the  reported  amounts  of assets  and
          liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the
          date of the financial  statements and the reported amounts of revenues
          and expenses during the reporting period.  Actual results could differ
          from those estimates.

    (c)   Cash and Cash Equivalents

          The Company  considers  all  unrestricted  cash and highly liquid debt
          instruments  with  original  maturities  of three months or less to be
          cash equivalents.

    (d)   Inventories

          Parts  inventory  represents  primarily the cost of the grinder knives
          and  machinery  parts  used in the TDF  manufacturing  process.  These
          inventories  are  stated  at  cost   (first-in,   first-out)  and  are
          depreciated  over the useful  lives of these parts,  generally  six to
          eighteen  months.  TDF  inventory  is  stated  at the lower of cost or
          market. Cost is determined using a weighted average cost method.

    (e)   Property, Plant and Equipment

          Property,  plant  and  equipment  are  stated  at cost.  Property  and
          equipment  under capital leases are stated at the lower of the present
          value of  minimum  lease  payments  or fair  value of the asset at the
          inception of the lease.

          Depreciation of property,  plant and equipment is calculated using the
          straight-line  method over the  estimated  useful  lives of the assets
          (generally  three to ten years).  Property,  plant and equipment  held
          under capital leases and leasehold  improvements  are amortized  using
          the  straight-line  method  over  the  shorter  of the  lease  term or
          estimated useful life of the asset.

    (f)   Bond Issuance Costs

          Bond issuance  costs are recorded at cost and amortized  over the life
          of the associated debt using the effective interest method.

                                      F-9
<PAGE>

    (g)   Goodwill

          The Company  assesses the  recoverability  of goodwill by  determining
          whether the  amortization of the asset balance over its remaining life
          can be recovered through  undiscounted  future operating cash flows of
          the acquired operation. The amount of impairment,  if any, is measured
          based  on  the  estimated  fair  value  of  the  operation.   Goodwill
          associated with the purchase of Domino (see note 2) is being amortized
          on a straight-line basis over ten years.

    (h)   Other Assets

          Patents,  which are included in other assets, are recorded at cost and
          amortized over a fifteen-year  period using the straight-line  method.
          Also  included  in  other  assets  as of  December  31,  1994  is  the
          noncurrent portion of a note receivable, which approximates $87,000 at
          December  31,  1994,  and which was received in full in 1995 (see note
          3).

    (i)   Income Taxes

          The Company  utilizes the asset and the liability method of accounting
          for income  taxes which  requires  the  recognition  of  deferred  tax
          liabilities  and assets for the expected  future tax  consequences  of
          temporary  differences  between the financial carrying amounts and the
          tax bases of assets and liabilities.

    (j)   Net Income (Loss) Per Common Share

          Net  income  or loss per  common  share is  computed  on the  weighted
          average number of common shares and dilutive common  equivalent shares
          outstanding  each  year.  Outstanding  stock  options,  warrants,  and
          conversion  rights are common  stock  equivalents  but are excluded in
          1995 and 1993 from the  calculation of loss per common share since the
          effect would be  antidilutive.  Primary and fully diluted earnings per
          share are the same in 1994.

          Net income or loss is adjusted by the effect of  undeclared  dividends
          on preferred stock of $142,506,  $142,502,  and $142,502 for the years
          ended December 31, 1995, 1994 and 1993,  respectively.  The effect was
          to: (1)  increase  the net loss per common  share by .01 in 1995;  (2)
          reduce  the net  income  per  common  share  by .02 in  1994;  and (3)
          increase the net loss per common share by .03 in 1993.

    (k)   Statements of Cash Flows

          The Company  paid  $469,903,  $377,558,  and  $370,888 for interest in
          1995, 1994 and 1993,  respectively.  No federal income taxes were paid
          during  1995,  1994 or 1993.  See note 20 for further  information  on
          noncash transactions.

    (l)   Recent Accounting Pronouncements

          In 1995, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued Statement No.
          121,  "Accounting  for the  Impairment  of  Long-Lived  Assets and for
          Long-Lived   Assets  to  be  Disposed  of"  and   Statement  No.  123,
          "Accounting  for  Stock-Based   Compensation."   Both  statements  are
          required for adoption in 1996.

          Statement  No.  121  requires  the  review of  long-lived  assets  for
          impairment  whenever events or changes in circumstances  indicate that
          the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable.

          An  impairment  loss  will be  recognized  if the sum of the  expected
          future cash flows  (undiscounted and without interest charges) is less
          than the carrying  amount of the asset.  The amount of the  impairment
          loss will be measured as the difference between the carrying amount of
          the asset and its  estimated  fair value.  The Company will adopt this
          statement in 1996 and does not  anticipate its adoption to be material
          to the consolidated financial statements.

          Statement No. 123 establishes  accounting and reporting  standards for
          various stock-based  compensation plans.  Statement No. 123 encourages
          the adoption of a fair value based method of  accounting  for employee
          stock  options,  but permits  continued  application of the accounting
          method  prescribed  by  Accounting  Principle  Board  Opinion  No.  25
          (Opinion 25),  "Accounting  for Stock Issued to  Employees."  Entities
          that  continue  to apply the  provisions  of  Opinion 25 must make pro
          forma  disclosures of net income and earnings per share as if the fair
          value based method of accounting  had been  applied.  The Company will
          adopt  Statement No. 123 in 1996 and currently  expects to continue to
          account for its employee stock options in accordance with Opinion 25.

          Certain prior year amounts have been  reclassified to conform with the
          current year presentation.

(2) ACQUISITION OF SUBSIDIARY
    -------------------------

          On March 21,  1995,  WRI  acquired  100% of the  outstanding  stock of
          Domino Salvage, Tire Division,  Inc., (Domino), a scrap tire recycling
          company   located   in   Conshohocken,   Pennsylvania,   a  suburb  of
          Philadelphia.  WRI invested  approximately  $500,000  during 1995 into
          Domino to bring Domino's scrap tire recycling capacity up to 5 million
          passenger tire  equivalents  (PTE's) per year.  Reconstruction  of the
          plant  was  completed  in  late  1995,  and  the  plant  became  fully
          operational in early 1996.

          The acquisition was accounted for as a purchase and, accordingly,  the
          purchase  price  has  been  allocated  to  the  assets   acquired  and
          liabilities  assumed  based on  estimated  fair  values at the date of
          acquisition. The results of operations of Domino have been included in
          the Company's  consolidated  statements of operations from the date of
          acquisition through December 31, 1995.

          The Company  purchased Domino for  approximately  $867,000,  including
          legal costs,  with an initial cash payment to the former  shareholders
          of $100,000. The Company is withholding an additional $50,000, payment
          of which  is  contingent  upon  certain  events  being  resolved.  The
          remaining payments will be made as follows:

                                1996   $ 66,664
                                1997    358,336
                                1998    275,000

                                       ========

          Effective March 21, 1996,  this note was modified to commence  monthly
          installment  payments on September  21, 1996, in the amount of $16,666
          per  month  for  twelve  consecutive  months.  The  second  and  third
          installments of $225,000 and $275,000, respectively, are to remain due
          on March 21, 1997 and 1998, respectively. Accrued interest as of March
          21,  1996,  is to be paid with one  payment of $30,000 in March  1996,
          followed by monthly  payments of $4,222 plus interest at prime plus 1%
          beginning  April 21, 1996, and continuing  through  December 21, 1996.
          The sum of payments is subject to certain cash flow calculations which
          may cause larger  payments  beginning  as of June 30, 1996.  This note
          bears interest at the rate of 1% over prime and the note is secured by
          the  assets  and the stock of Domino  (included  in note 12).  The new
          terms of the modified  agreement are reflected in the above  remaining
          payments   schedule.   The  acquisition   also  includes  a  five-year
          employment agreement with the former President and owner of Domino.

    --------------------------

          During 1994,  the Company sold equipment for $300,000 and recognized a
          gain of  $90,078.  The terms of the sale  included  a down  payment of
          $100,000,  followed by a $75,000  payment due March 10, 1995, with the
          remaining $125,000 to be paid over a two-year term beginning April 10,
          1995. The current  portion  ($113,000) of the note was included in the
          note  and  other  receivables   account  and  the  noncurrent  portion
          ($87,000)  was included in other  assets as of December 31, 1994.  The

          property  damage and business  interruption  insurance  related to the
          Baytown  fire  (see  note  19).  The  Company  received  approximately
          $300,000 of this amount in January 1995, then received a final payment
          in August 1995.  A  difference  of $28,582 is included in other income

(8) RESTRICTED CASH
    ---------------

          Under terms of various debt  agreements  (see note 12), the Company is
          required to  maintain  cash  balances  which have  certain  withdrawal
          restrictions.  Amounts  on  deposit  at  December  31,  1995  and 1994
          consisted  of  certificates  of deposit or money  market  accounts  as
          follows:

          Pursuant to provisions  in the loan  agreement,  funds were  disbursed
          from the repair and maintenance fund in 1995 and 1994.

          In  connection  with the  guaranty by the Company of the bonds sold by
          Waste  Recovery -  Illinois  in  September  1994,  certain  holders of
          long-term debt of the Company required that an additional  $195,000 of
          collateral be placed in the plant financing debt reserve.  The Company
          utilized some of the funds obtained from the private  placement of its
          convertible  subordinated  debentures  for this purpose (see note 11).
          The  Company  was also  required  to provide to these debt  holders an
          additional lien of $600,000 on its Portland facility.

(9) INVESTMENT IN WASTE RECOVERY - ILLINOIS
    ---------------------------------------

          Waste  Recovery - Illinois was formed to jointly build and operate two
          tire-derived  fuel  processing  facilities  in  Dupo  and  Marseilles,
          Illinois.  The facilities cost approximately $5 million each and began
          operation  in late 1995.  Waste  Recovery  - Illinois  has a five year
          contract  to supply  Illinois  Power  Company  with 60,000 tons of TDF
          annually which represents 50% of the facilities'  estimated production
          capacity.

          Waste  Recovery -  Illinois  completed  the sale of $8.875  million in
          solid waste  disposal  revenue  bonds as of September  27,  1994.  The
          proceeds of the bonds were used to finance the construction of the two
          facilities.  The Company is  guarantor on the bonds and, as manager of
          the Illinois partnership, is subject to receive administrative fees of
          $4,000  per  month  plus a  management  fee  based on net  income,  as
          defined.  During 1995, the Company  collected  $12,000 in such fees as
          both plants were operational in October 1995.

          At  December  31,  1994,  the  Company's  investment  in the  Illinois
          partnership included costs and expenses incurred by WRI which were not
          reimbursable   to  the  Company   under  the  terms  of  the  Illinois
          partnership  agreement.  Also,  under the equity method of accounting,
          the Company recognized $322,630 and $20,260 as losses from partnership
          operations   for  the  years  ended   December   31,  1995  and  1994,
          respectively.  No  income  or loss  from  partnership  operations  was
          incurred for 1993.


                                      F-15
<PAGE>

          At  December  31,  1995 and  1994,  the  Company's  investment  in the
          Illinois partnership includes $258,680 and $61,882,  respectively,  in
          inventories which were transferred to the Partnership at cost.

          Riverside Caloric Company (RCC) contributed $2 million and the Company
          contributed  a license of its  technology  and  assigned  the Illinois
          partnership  all of its  right,  title  and  interest  in a  five-year
          contract with Illinois Power Company.  The Company  received  $750,000
          upon reaching certain  performance  objectives for the construction of
          equipment  used by the  Illinois  partnership  upon the startup of the
          facilities.   Fifty-five   percent  of  this  fee,   representing  the
          percentage of the Illinois  partnership  not owned by the Company,  is
          being recognized in other income for the year ended December 31, 1995.
          The  remaining  45%  has  been  recorded  as  deferred  revenue  to be
          recognized  such that it will  offset the  Company's  interest  in the
          excess  depreciation  expense  recorded by the Partnership  related to
          this  portion of the cost of the  plants.  Of the  $750,000  received,
          $500,000 of it is restricted  until certain  criteria  regarding  cash
          flow  before debt  service,  as defined,  is attained  for  successive
          years, as defined.

          Profits,  losses and credits of the Illinois partnership are basically
          allocated  in  accordance  with the  partners'  percentage  interests,
          except  that  net  capital  event  proceeds,  as  defined,   shall  be
          distributed to the partners  first,  100% to RCC until it has received
          $2,000,000 of distributions,  and second, 100% to the Company until it
          has received  $2,000,000 of distributions.  Thereafter,  any remaining
          balance is distributed in accordance with the percentage interests.

          The Company has the option to purchase a portion of RCC's  partnership
          interest in the Illinois  partnership  to reduce RCC's interest to 50%
          at specified dates throughout the first five years of operations.  The
          Company  also has the option to purchase all of RCC's  interest  based
          upon certain defined criteria after four years of operations.  RCC has
          the option to require the Company to purchase RCC's entire partnership
          interest  for a  purchase  price,  as  defined.  This  option  may  be
          exercised  at any  time  on or  after  the  third  anniversary  of the
          operating  date and prior to the fifth  anniversary  of the  operating
          date.

(10)NOTES PAYABLE
    -------------

          The  Company  finances   insurance   premiums  under  note  agreements
          providing for fixed monthly  principal and interest  payments due over
          terms not to exceed nine months.  Balances outstanding under such note
          agreements  aggregated  $28,945 and  $121,757 at December 31, 1995 and
          1994, respectively.  Included in notes payable at December 31, 1994 is
          $25,000 due to an individual  and $22,050 due officers of the Company,
          all of which were paid in full in 1995. In addition,  the Company also
          had $2,108  remaining on a note payable to a bank at December 31, 1994
          for a vehicle.

          With the  acquisition of Domino (see note 2), the Company assumed debt
          to an  affiliate of Domino in the  original  amount of  $180,095.  The
          terms of this note provide for  interest and  principal to be deferred
          until  January 1, 1998,  at which time monthly  principal and interest
          payments are to be made at prime over a two-year  term.  Consequently,
          this note has been recorded as of March 21, 1995 (acquisition date) at
          its present value of $130,569, discounted at a rate of ten percent.

(11)CONVERTIBLE SUBORDINATED DEBENTURES
    -----------------------------------

          Effective  September  30,  1994,  the  Company  privately  placed with
          accredited  investors  and  certain   shareholders   $800,000  of  10%
          convertible subordinated debentures due March 15, 1996. The debentures
          are  convertible  at the option of the  registered  holders in minimum
          amounts of $10,000  at any time prior to  maturity  at the rate of one
          share of  common  stock  for each  $.875 in  debenture  principal  and
          accrued interest amount. The indebtedness  evidenced by the debentures
          is  subordinate  to all  senior  indebtedness  of the  Company  and is
          unsecured.  As of December 31, 1994, none of these debentures had been
          converted.

          In  conjunction  with the Rights  Offering (see note 16) in June 1995,
          $265,000 of the  subordinated  convertible  debentures,  plus  accrued
          interest of  $17,951,  were  converted  at the rate of $.875 per share
          into 323,373  shares of common stock.  At the first  interest  payment
          date,  September 15, 1995, the remaining  debenture holders elected to
          convert  interest  due on the  debentures  in the amount of $51,301 to
          58,631 shares of common stock.

          As of the  original  maturity  date,  March 15,  1996,  $40,000 of the
          debentures plus interest of $1,995 were converted at the rate of $.875
          per share into 47,994 shares of common stock; $85,000 plus interest of
          $4,238 of the debentures  were  converted  into cash; an  unaffiliated
          individual  purchased  $85,000 in debentures under the exchange terms;
          and the  remaining  $410,000  in  debentures  were  exchanged  for new
          debentures  which carry an interest  rate of 18% and mature on January
          31, 1997. Other terms and conversion privileges are the same as in the
          original debentures. Consequently, as of December 31, 1995, $40,000 of
          the  debentures are recorded in current  liabilities  and $495,000 are
          recorded in noncurrent  liabilities in the  accompanying  1995 balance
          sheet.

(13)MINORITY INTEREST IN CONSOLIDATED PARTNERSHIP
    ---------------------------------------------

          During  1993,  the  Company  owned a 65%  interest  in Waste  Recovery
          Partners,  Ltd.  (Partnership).  The minority  interest  owner was KCT
          Associates, Ltd., an investment limited partnership (KCT), which owned
          35% of the Partnership. The Partnership owned the TDF production plant
          in  Portland,  Oregon,  and the  Company  acted as manager and general
          partner of the  Partnership  for management  and profit  incentives of
          $4,000 per month and 5% of partnership income, respectively.

          Effective  January 1, 1994,  KCT  converted  its  limited  partnership
          interests in the Partnership into 2.6 million  unregistered  shares of
          the Company's common stock which equated to  approximately  35% of the
          fully diluted  outstanding common stock at the time of the conversion.
          Due to this  conversion,  the  operations  of the  Partnership  became
          wholly-owned  by  the  Company.   The  1994   consolidated   financial
          statements reflect the operations of the combined entities.  KCT's 35%
          interest is reflected in the 1993 consolidated financial statements as
          minority interest.

(14)INCENTIVE STOCK OPTION PLAN, RESTRICTED STOCK PURCHASE PLAN AND WARRANTS
    ------------------------------------------------------------------------

          In 1989,  the Company  adopted the 1989 Stock Plan for employees  (the
          Plan).  The purpose of the Plan is to provide certain key employees of
          the Company  with a  proprietary  interest in the Company  through the
          granting  of options,  restricted  stock or other  stock  rights.  The
          Company has  reserved  1,550,000  shares of common  stock for issuance
          upon exercise of such options and rights issued pursuant to this Plan.

          The  terms and  amounts  of  options  are  determined  by the Board of
          Directors.  The Plan  provides that option prices will be no less than
          50% (or 100% depending on the type of option) of the fair market value
          per share at the grant date. The aggregate fair market value of common
          stock  underlying an incentive stock option  determined at the date of
          the grant  shall not exceed  $100,000 in the year in which the options
          are first exercisable.

          Shares of common stock issued under the Plan as  restricted  stock are
          determined  by  the  Board  of  Directors.   Restrictions,   including
          forfeiture  provisions and  consideration for issuance of such shares,
          are  determined by the Board of  Directors.  The  consideration  to be
          received by the Company for issuance of such restricted stock shall be
          no more than 50% of the fair market value at the date of the grant.

          The Plan also  provides  that the Board of  Directors  may grant stock
          appreciation  rights (SARs)  entitling  the grantee,  upon exercise of
          such rights, to receive cash from the Company equal to the increase of
          the fair market  value of the common  stock of the  Company  times the
          number of units of SARs exercised  subsequent to the date of grant. As
          of December 31, 1995, no restricted stock or SARs had been granted.

          The terms of the grants, including the grantees, are administered by a
          Stock Option Committee which was formed by the Board of Directors.

          In 1990,  the Company  entered into an agreement  with the Chairman of
          the  Company's  Board of  Directors  granting  him options to purchase
          200,000  shares  of common  stock at $.41 per  share for a  seven-year
          period ending April 3, 1997.  Such options may only be exercised  once
          the Company has  achieved  twelve  months of  profitability  or in the
          event of a change in control. These options became exercisable in 1992
          as the Company  achieved twelve months of  profitability.  At December
          31, 1995, none of the aforementioned options had been exercised.

          During 1988 and 1991, the Company granted  nonqualified  stock options
          to non-employee  directors for continued service to the Company.  Such
          options  were  exercisable  through  December  1993 and January  1996,
          respectively.  Transactions  related to these  options are  summarized
          below:

          No transactions occurred during the year ended December 31, 1994.

          At the 1992 Annual Meeting,  the shareholders  approved the 1992 Stock
          Plan for Non-Employee  Directors.  Pursuant to such plan, non-employee
          directors  of the  Company  receive  annually  (1)  after  the  annual
          meeting,  a stock  option to purchase  2,500 shares of common stock so
          long as the  Company's  net  income  for the  fiscal  year just  ended
          improved over the prior year, and (2) in January, a common stock grant
          valued at $2,000 for service as a director if attendance  criteria are
          met.  Such plan  terminates  January 31, 2000 and 250,000  shares were
          reserved  by the  Company  for  grants  thereunder.  Under  this plan,
          12,366,  4,361 and  10,664  shares  were  issued  for the years  ended
          December 31, 1995, 1994 and 1993, respectively.

          In connection with the formation of Waste Recovery Partners, Ltd., the
          Company  granted the general  partner of KCT (see note 13) warrants to
          purchase  300,000  shares  of  common  stock  for  investment  banking
          services and 25,000 shares of common stock at $.01/share for financial
          advisory services. Both warrants were exercised in February 1994.

(15)STOCKHOLDERS' EQUITY
    --------------------

          In 1990, the Company issued 203,580 shares of 7% cumulative  preferred
          stock  redeemable  at the  Company's  option  for  $10 per  share.  No
          dividends were declared or paid on such preferred  stock in 1995, 1994
          or 1993.  Accordingly,  dividends in arrears on  cumulative  preferred
          stock aggregated  $795,829 at December 31, 1995 which represents $3.91
          per share of such stock outstanding. Dividends on cumulative preferred
          stock  have been  added to net loss or  deducted  from net  income for
          purposes of computing per common share amounts.

(16)RIGHTS OFFERING
    ---------------

          Waste  Recovery,  Inc.  completed a rights  offering on June 26, 1995,
          which  distributed  nontransferable  subscription  rights to  eligible
          stockholders,  as defined, to subscribe for the Company's common stock
          at  an  offering  price  of  $.75.  This  "Rights   Offering"   raised
          approximately  $2.2  million in capital,  which is being  utilized for
          specific equipment  improvements at each of the Company's  facilities,
          including Domino.  The Company issued 3,238,857 shares of common stock
          with this rights offering.

(17)RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS
    --------------------------

          The Company  received fees of $535,000 in 1995,  $556,000 in 1994, and
          $515,000  in  1993  for  accepting  and  hauling  scrap  tires  from a
          significant stockholder.

          In 1994 and 1993, in lieu of directors'  fees, 4,361 and 10,664 shares
          of the  Company's  common stock were issued to the outside  directors,
          respectively.  In 1995, the outside directors received $36,000 ($6,000
          each)  as  compensation   for  services,   $6,000  ($1,000  each)  for
          attendance  at  Board of  Directors  meetings,  and a total of  12,366
          shares of common stock as described in note 14.

          The Company incurred  $60,000 in consulting fees to certain  directors
          for assistance  with the sale of the Waste Recovery - Illinois  bonds,
          which was recorded in 1994 and paid in 1995.

                                      F-21
<PAGE>

          Included in accounts payable at December 31, 1995 and 1994, is $55,237
          and $81,083 due to Waste  Recovery -  Illinois,  respectively.  During
          1995, the Company disposed of approximately 7,514 tons of tires at the
          Partnership's  Dupo,  Illinois plant and incurred disposal fees to the
          partnership in the amount of $336,382.

(18)INCOME TAXES
    ------------

          Upon  adoption  of FAS 109 at January 1, 1993,  a gross  deferred  tax
          asset of approximately $2,889,000 was recorded which primarily related
          to the future tax  benefits of net  operating  loss carry  forwards of
          approximately  $6,200,000  which expire in 2000 - 2005 and excess book
          over tax  depreciation.  Should certain changes occur in the Company's
          ownership,  there could be an annual  limitation  on the amount of net
          operating loss available to offset taxable income. Upon adoption,  the
          Company  believed  that it was more likely than not that a significant
          portion of the deferred tax asset would not be realizable and recorded
          a valuation allowance of approximately $2,807,000 against the deferred
          tax assets. The deferred tax assets were considered realizable only to
          the  extent  they  offset  deferred  tax  liabilities  on that date of
          approximately  $82,000.  The  Company  had no  deferred  tax assets or
          liabilities previously recorded.  Accordingly, there was no cumulative
          effect adjustment for the adoption of FAS 109.

          For the year ended December 31, 1994,  the Company  adjusted its gross
          deferred tax asset,  including a reduction in the valuation  allowance
          of  $508,761,  which  reflected  the expected  utilization  of the net
          operating loss carry forwards that were previously  expected to expire
          unutilized.  The net operating loss carry-forwards were expected to be
          utilized based on projected  taxable income in 1995 from a significant
          nonrecurring  gain on the  sale  of  equipment  to  Waste  Recovery  -
          Illinois together with projected positive results from operations. The
          net change in the  deferred  tax asset of $447,543  represented  a tax
          benefit for the year ended December 31, 1994.

          The  deferred tax asset  recorded at December 31, 1995,  is based on a
          net  operating  loss  carry-forward  expected to be utilized  based on
          projected positive results.

          The  provision  (benefit)  for income taxes  consists of the following
          components for the year ended December 31:

                                        1995      1994      1993

(19)INVOLUNTARY CONVERSION OF ASSETS
    --------------------------------

          On  August  7,  1994,  the  Baytown  (outside  Houston,  Texas)  plant
          sustained substantial damage due to a fire. Consequently,  the plant's
          operations  were  shut  down  from  that  time  until the last week of
          December  1994.  During  this  period,  the  plant  incurred  a  major
          renovation  and clean-up.  This  involuntary  conversion of assets has
          been recognized in the year ending December 31, 1994, as follows:


          Net insurance proceeds received on property ...   $ 372,137
               Net book value of property destroyed .....      (8,750)

          Net loss on involuntary conversion of assets ..   $(186,242)
                                                            ========= 

          The  renovation  of the Baytown  plant was  completed in late December
          1994.  The cost of the  renovation is included in plant,  property and
          equipment in the amount of $263,035 at December 31, 1994.

          The Company applied for business  interruption  insurance to cover the
          loss of  operating  revenues  during the time the plant was shut down.
          The claim was not  processed  until the fall of 1995;  of the $120,000
          recorded as receivable in the accompanying 1994 financial  statements,
          only $91,418 was received and the  difference  of $28,582 was recorded
          as an expense during 1995.

(20)NONCASH TRANSACTIONS
    --------------------

          During 1995, the Company had the following noncash  transactions which
          have been excluded from the statements of cash flows:

                                                                    Increase

                                                                   ----------

                                                                   $    --
                                                                     =======

          In addition to the above noncash  transactions during 1995, see note 2
          regarding  the  assets and  liabilities  acquired  and the  additional
          $700,000 in debt incurred with the acquisition of Domino.

                                      F-24
<PAGE>

          Capital  lease  obligations  of $192,274 and $156,906 were incurred in
          1994 and 1993, respectively,  when the Company entered into leases for
          new machinery and equipment.

(21)BUSINESS AND CREDIT CONCENTRATIONS
    ----------------------------------

          The Company's  customers are located throughout the United States. The
          Company derived revenues of $535,000, $556,000 and $515,000 during the
          years  ended  December  31,  1995,  1994 and 1993,  respectively,  for
          accepting and hauling scrap tires from a significant stockholder. Four
          additional  customers  accounted for significant Company sales for the
          years ended December 31:

                                 1995         1994          1993
             Customer one .   $2,999,000   $3,041,000   $     --
             Customer two .    1,604,000    1,566,000    1,138,000
             Customer three    2,221,000    1,506,000    1,762,000
             Customer four       832,000      750,000      679,000
                              ----------   ----------   ----------
             Total ........   $7,656,000   $6,863,000   $3,579,000
                              ==========   ==========   ==========

          In addition to these  customers,  which are all significant  entities,
          the Company does  business  with a variety of  companies  with diverse
          credit risk.  The Company does not  generally  require  collateral  or
          other  security from its customers  and has  historically  encountered
          very little loss on its receivables.

(22)PROFIT SHARING PLAN
    -------------------

          Effective  January 1, 1995,  the Company  adopted the Waste  Recovery,
          Inc., 401(k) Plan (the Plan), a defined  contribution plan.  Employees
          who have  completed six months of service and have attained the age of
          twenty-one   are  eligible  to  become   participants   in  the  Plan.
          Participants  may  contribute  up to 15%  of  their  compensation,  as
          defined, annually. Company contributions to the Plan are determined at
          the discretion of the Board of Directors.  No contributions  were made
          during the year ended December 31, 1995.

(23)LITIGATION AND CONTINGENCIES
    ----------------------------

          The  Company  is a party  to  certain  lawsuits  which  are  generally
          incidental to its business.  Management  does not believe the ultimate
          resolution  of such  matters  will  have a  significant  effect on the
          Company's financial position and, therefore,  no liabilities have been
          recorded in the accompanying consolidated financial statements.

          Like other waste management  companies,  the Company's  operations are
          subject to  extensive  and  changing  federal and state  environmental
          regulations  governing  emissions  into  the  atmosphere,   wastewater
          discharges,  solid and hazardous waste management  activities and site
          restoration  and abandonment  activities.  As of December 31, 1995, no
          such  costs had been  accrued  and  management  does not  believe  the
          affects of the  aforementioned  activities will have a material effect
          on the Company's financial statements.

(24)FOURTH QUARTER ADJUSTMENTS
    --------------------------

          During the fourth  quarter of 1995,  several  significant  adjustments
          occurred which negatively  impacted the Company's 1995 net loss. These
          are as follows:

(a)  The Company  was liable for a special  clean-up  project in Harris  County,
     Texas as retribution for the fire in Baytown,  Texas in 1994. This clean-up
     was  performed  in  February  1996 and cost  approximately  $50,000 and was
     accrued for as of December 31, 1995.

(b)  Inventory  adjustments  at year end for the  Portland  and  Atlanta  plants
     caused approximately $135,000 in write-offs and write-downs,  respectively.
     The year end  observation  in  Portland  revealed a  miscalculation  of TDF
     yield,  which  generated a $100,000  downward  adjustment  in the amount of
     inventory on hand. Atlanta's pricing on TDF decreased between December 1995
     and January 1996 by $7.00 per ton. To properly value inventory at the lower
     of cost or market,  this caused a $35,000  write-down  as of  December  31,
     1995.

(c)  Other negative year end adjustments of  approximately  $100,000 were caused
     by  identification  of  machinery  previously  disposed,  accrual  of sales
     commissions  for TDF sales,  and other  adjustments of prepaids and accrued
     liabilities.

(25)DISCLOSURES ABOUT FAIR VALUE OF FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS
    -----------------------------------------------------

          The fair value of the Company's  current  assets,  restricted cash and
          accounts  payable  approximates  the recorded  amounts  because of the
          liquidity and short maturity of these instruments.

          It is not  practicable  to  estimate  the fair value of the  Company's
          long-term debt as it is unique as a debt instrument for which there is
          no public market.

(26)SUBSEQUENT EVENTS
    -----------------

          On January 30, 1996,  the Company  advanced  Waste Recovery - Illinois
          $500,000 for the Illinois partnership's February 1, 1996 debt payment.
          The loan was  approved  by the  Executive  Committee  of the  Illinois
          partnership.  Terms of the note are in the process of being  finalized
          and will be defined on an arm's length basis.

statements  are  the  responsibility  of  the  Partnership's   management;   our

                            WASTE RECOVERY - ILLINOIS

                        (AN ILLINOIS GENERAL PARTNERSHIP)
                          Notes to Financial Statements

                                                                             
(1) SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES
    ------------------------------------------

    (a)  Organization and Operations

          Waste  Recovery -  Illinois,  an  Illinois  general  partnership  (the
          Partnership),  was formed  November  29,  1993,  to jointly  build and
          operate  two  tire-derived  fuel  processing  facilities  in Dupo  and
          Marseilles,  Illinois  (Illinois plants).  The facilities,  which cost
          approximately  $5  million  each and began  operations  in the fall of
          1995,  supply Illinois Power Company  (Illinois  Power) at its Baldwin
          facility  (Baldwin)  with 60,000 tons of TDF annually over a five year
          period.   The  Illinois  Power  contract   accounts  for  50%  of  the
          facilities' estimated production capacity.

          The Partnership  specializes in processing  scrap tires into a refined
          fuel supplement more commonly  referred to as tire-derived fuel (TDF).
          The Partnership generates income from the sale of TDF and from tipping
          fees charged for the disposal of tires. The  Partnership's  operations
          are presently in Illinois and nearby states.

          The managing partner of the Partnership is Waste Recovery, Inc. (WRI),
          a Texas  corporation,  which has a 45%  interest  in the  Partnership;
          Riverside  Caloric  Company (RCC), an Indiana  corporation,  has a 55%
          interest in the Partnership.

    (b)  Management Estimates

          The  preparation of financial  statements in conformity with generally
          accepted  accounting  principles requires management to make estimates
          and  assumptions  that  effect  the  reported  amounts  of assets  and
          liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the
          date of the financial  statements and the reported amounts of revenues
          and expenses during the reporting period.  Actual results could differ
          from those estimates.

    (c)  Cash and Cash Equivalents

          The Partnership considers all unrestricted cash and highly liquid debt
          instruments  with  original  maturities  of three months or less to be
          cash equivalents.

    (d)  Investments

          In 1994, the bond proceeds were invested into various interest-bearing
          accounts for periods ranging from  approximately 30 days to 16 months,
          with   interest   rates  varying  from  4.25%  to  8.875%  per  annum.
          Investments  with maturity dates greater than one year  (approximately
          $148,760) are included in  restricted  cash in the  accompanying  1994
          balance sheet.  The investments  matured during 1995, and the proceeds
          were used for the construction of the plants.

    (e)  Inventories

          Parts  inventory  represents  primarily the cost of the grinder knives
          and  machinery  parts  used in the TDF  manufacturing  process.  These
          inventories  are  stated  at  cost   (first-in,   first-out)  and  are
          depreciated  over the useful  lives of these parts,  generally  six to
          eighteen months.

          TDF  inventory  is  stated  at the  lower of cost or  market.  Cost is
          determined using a weighted average cost method.

    (f)  Property, Plant and Equipment

          Property,  plant and  equipment  are stated at cost.  Depreciation  of
          property,  plant and equipment is calculated  using the  straight-line
          method over the estimated useful lives of the assets  (generally three
          to ten years), beginning at the point in time the assets are placed in
          service.  No  depreciation  was recorded in 1994 as the assets had not
          been placed in service or were acquired at the end of the year.

    (g)  Construction in Progress

          Construction  of the Illinois plants began in 1994; Dupo was completed
          in September  1995,  and Marseilles was completed in October 1995. The
          costs incurred to build the plants and equipment  were  capitalized as
          construction  in  progress  until  the  projects  were  completed  and
          individual assets could be identified,  at which time, the assets were
          transferred into property, plant and equipment.

    (h)  Preoperating Costs

          Preoperating  costs  represent  those costs  incurred in the planning,
          engineering  and development of the Illinois  plants.  These costs are
          being amortized over three years on a straight-line  basis,  beginning
          with the operation of the plants.

    (i)  Bond Issuance Costs

          Bond issuance  costs are recorded at cost and amortized  over the life
          of the associated debt using the amount of bonds outstanding method.

    (j)  Other Assets

          Other  assets are  recorded  at cost and  consist  mainly of  prepaid,
          additional  rent  for the  land at the  Dupo  plant,  which  is  being
          amortized over the term of the lease, and bank finance fees, which are
          being amortized over the term of the bonds.

                                      F-34

    (k)  Deferred Grant Revenue

          The Partnership has an agreement  whereby it has earned  $1,000,000 in
          grants from the State of Illinois  with the  successful  completion of
          certain pieces of equipment at the Illinois plants. As of December 31,
          1994, the  Partnership  had received  $800,000 from these grants;  the
          remaining  $200,000 is included in other current assets as of December
          31, 1995,  and was received in January 1996.  The grant money is being
          amortized, beginning when the plants were placed in operation, through
          the term of the grants, which is July 31, 1999.

          In 1995,  the  Partnership  also  received  $365,903  through  a grant
          awarded  to the  Illinois  Power  Company  for  the  construction  and
          installation of a metering unit at Illinois  Power.  Twenty percent of
          the total amount of the grant is being retained  pending  satisfaction
          of certain  operational  requirements.  Ownership of the metering unit
          reverts to Illinois Power at the end of the contract.

    (l)  Income Taxes

          No provision or credit for federal  income taxes has been made because
          income taxes are the  responsibility of the individual  partners.  The
          net difference  between the tax bases and the reported  amounts of the
          Partnership's  assets and  liabilities  is  approximately  $700,000 at
          December 31, 1995.

    (m)  Statements of Cash Flows

          During 1995,  the  Partnership  paid $530,447 for interest and did not
          pay any income taxes.  Interest  expense totaled $578,899 and interest
          income totaled $207,079 for the year ended December 31, 1995. Of these
          amounts,  $188,708 of interest  expense  was offset  against  eligible
          interest  income,  and  $234,833  was  capitalized  into  the  cost of
          construction.

          The  Partnership did not pay any interest or income taxes during 1994.
          Interest expense totaled $150,629 and interest income totaled $145,359
          for the year ended  December 31, 1994. Of these  amounts,  $139,941 of
          interest  expense was offset against  eligible  interest  income,  and
          $10,688 was capitalized into the cost of construction.

    (n)  Reclassification

          Certain  1994 amounts  have been  reclassified  to conform to the 1995
          presentation.

          Under terms of the bond  agreements  (see note 8), the  Partnership is

          which have certain  withdrawal  restrictions.  The amounts reserved at

          respectively. Interest earned on this restricted cash may only be used
          for payment of current debt service on the bonds.

(6) LONG-TERM DEBT
    --------------

          Long-term  debt at December  31, 1995 and 1994,  consists of two notes
          payable to a financial institution.  The notes are payable in eighteen
          equal  installments  of principal  and interest at $951 and $1,074 per
          month with interest at 8.5% per annum. The notes are collateralized by
          vehicles  and  will  be  fully  paid  in  June  and   December   1996,
          respectively.

(7) DEFERRED GRANT REVENUE
    ----------------------

          The Partnership  (Grantee)  entered into two grant agreements with the
          Illinois  Department  of Commerce and Community  Affairs  (Department)
          (formerly,  the Illinois Department of Energy and Natural Resource) as
          of June 1, 1994.  The  Department  administers  the Used Tire Recovery
          Program which offers  financial  incentives  for projects which reuse,
          recycle or recover energy from Illinois used or scrap tires.

          The  Partnership   requested  funding  assistance  to  build  its  TDF
          processing  plants in Dupo and  Marseilles,  Illinois.  The Department
          agreed to provide  grants  towards the  Partnership's  "projects,"  as
          defined.  The  Grantee  agrees that at least 30% of the scrap tires it
          processes will come from Illinois  sources,  and that a minimum of one
          million Illinois PTE's (passenger tire equivalents),  as defined, will
          be collected  and  processed  annually at each plant.  The  Department
          awarded the Grantee $1,000,000 towards specified  equipment  ($500,000
          at each plant),  payable at 80% ($800,000) as based upon the specified
          equipment  budget.  The  Department  held  back 20% of the  funds as a
          retainer until  verification  that all equipment  purchased with Grant
          Funds,  as defined,  had been  installed  and was  operational.  As of
          December 31, 1995,  the 20% retainage  ($200,000) had been applied for
          and was received in January 1996.

          The term of the grants is through  July 31,  1999,  and  requires  the
          Partnership  to maintain the  equipment  for the purpose as originally
          set forth in the agreement, to provide the Department with semi-annual
          reports, and to meet certain other listed criteria.

          The Partnership received additional funding through a grant awarded to
          the Illinois Power Company for the  construction of a metering unit at
          the Baldwin Power Plant of the Illinois Power Company. The Partnership
          has received 80% of this award ($365,903) as of December 31, 1995, and
          approximately  20% is being retained  pending  satisfaction of certain
          operational  requirements.  This award is being amortized  through the
          remainder of the contract with Illinois  Power,  which is through July
          1999.

                                      F-37
<PAGE>

          As  of  December  31,  1995,  $1,270,547  of  the  total  grant  money
          recognized is recorded as deferred  grant revenue in the  accompanying
          balance  sheet and is being  amortized  into income  through  July 31,
          1999, at approximately $30,000 per month.

(8) BONDS PAYABLE
    -------------

          To provide  funding for the  construction  of the Dupo and  Marseilles
          plants,  the  Partnership   entered  into  two  loan  agreements:   1)
          $4,845,000  with  the  Southwestern   Illinois  Development  Authority
          (SWIDA)  and 2)  $4,030,000  with  the  Upper  Illinois  River  Valley
          Development  Authority (UIRVDA) (together,  the Bonds),  respectively.
          The Bonds were issued through the Solid Waste Disposal  Revenue Bonds,
          Series 1994 (Waste  Recovery - Illinois  Project)  dated  September 1,
          1994,  under an  Indenture of Trust.  The proceeds to the  Partnership
          were to fund a debt service  reserve fund, to pay the costs of issuing
          the Bonds,  to pay interest  during  construction,  and to finance the
          cost of the construction of buildings and related improvements and the
          acquisition  and  installation  of  machinery,  equipment  and related
          property,  all  constituting  industrial,  commercial  and solid waste
          disposal facilities located at Dupo and Marseilles, Illinois.

          The notes  bear  interest  at 6.5% per  annum  with  interest  payable
          February  1 and  August  1 each  year,  beginning  February  1,  1995.
          Principal  payments  are due  annually on February 1 beginning in 1996
          through 2004.

          The notes are  collateralized by the property,  plant and equipment of
          the  Partnership  and are guaranteed by Waste  Recovery,  Inc.  Future
          minimum payments as of February 1 each year are as follows:

(10)LEASES
    ------

          The Partnership leases the land for the Dupo facility from the Village
          of Dupo under a  non-cancelable  operating  lease.  The lease began on

             Total minimum payments                             $225,000
                                                                ========

          Total  rental  expense  for the  land in Dupo  and  various  equipment
          rentals  for the year ended  December  31,  1995,  was  $36,718.

(11)SIGNIFICANT CONTRACTS
    ---------------------

          The  Partnership  entered  into a  contract  with the  Illinois  Power
          Company on October 12, 1993, to supply it with at least 60,000 tons of
          TDF per year for a period of five years.  If the Partnership is unable
          to fulfill this  requirement,  WRI will sell TDF produced at its other
          facilities to the Partnership. Sales to Illinois Power of TDF produced
          in Dupo began in September 1995.

(12)BUSINESS AND CREDIT CONCENTRATIONS
    ----------------------------------

          During 1995, the Partnership  derived revenues of $336,382 in disposal
          fees from WRI for  approximately  7,514 tons of tires received in Dupo
          from a WRI project.  As of December 31, 1995, WRI owed the Partnership
          $55,237 from these disposal fees.

                                      F-41
<PAGE>

          The Partnership's tire-derived fuel sales were exclusively to Illinois
          Power  Company  (see note 11) and  amounted  to 49% of the total  1995
          revenues.

          The Partnership's  customers are located in the Midwestern and Eastern
          United  States.  The  Partnership  does  business  with a  variety  of
          companies with diverse credit risk. The Partnership does not generally
          require  collateral  or  other  security  from its  customers  and has
          encountered very little loss on its receivables.

(13)FAIR VALUE OF FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS
    -----------------------------------

          The fair value of the  Partnership's  current assets,  restricted cash
          and accounts payable  approximates the recorded amounts because of the
          liquidity and short maturity of these instruments.

          It is not practicable to estimate the fair value of the  Partnership's
          long-term debt as it is a unique debt instrument for which there is no
          public market.

(14)PROFIT SHARING PLAN
    -------------------

          The  employees  of  the  Partnership  may  participate  in  the  Waste
          Recovery,  Inc., 401(k) Plan (the Plan), a defined  contribution plan.
          Employees  who have  completed six months of service and have attained
          the age of twenty-one are eligible to become participants in the Plan.
          Participants  may  contribute  up to 15%  of  their  compensation,  as
          defined,    annually.   Any   employer   contributions   are   totally
          discretionary; none were made during 1995.

(15)CONTINGENCIES
    -------------

          Like other waste management  companies,  the Partnership's  operations
          are subject to extensive and changing federal and state  environmental
          regulations  governing  emissions  into  the  atmosphere,   wastewater
          discharges,  solid and hazardous waste management  activities and site
          restoration  and abandonment  activities.  As of December 31, 1995, no
          such  costs had been  accrued  and  management  does not  believe  the
          affects of the  aforementioned  activities will have a material effect
          on the Partnership's financial statements.
