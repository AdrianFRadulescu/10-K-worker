                         REPORT OF INDEPENDENT AUDITORS


To the Partners of
Vipont Royalty Income Fund, Ltd.
Fort Collins, Colorado


We have audited the accompanying balance sheets of Vipont Royalty Income Fund,
Ltd., (the Partnership) as of December 31, 1994 and 1993, and the related
statements of operations, changes in partners' equity (deficit), and cash flows
for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 1994.  These
financial statements are the responsibility of the Partnership's management. Our
responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements based on
our audits.

We conducted our audits in accordance with generally accepted auditing
standards.  Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to
obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of
material misstatement.  An audit includes examining, on a test  basis, evidence
supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements.  An audit
also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant
estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial
statement presentation.  We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis
for our opinion.

In our opinion, such financial statements present fairly, in all material
respects, the financial position of the Partnership at December 31, 1994 and
1993, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the
three years in the period ended December 31, 1994, in conformity with generally
accepted accounting principles.

                  YEARS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 1994, 1993 AND 1992


1.  SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

    Vipont Royalty Income Fund, Ltd. (the Partnership) is a Colorado Limited
Partnership which was formed on August 5, 1987.  The Partnership's activities
to date have consisted of funding the research and development of new
periodontal products for therapeutic use.  Pursuant to a vote of the limited
partners on June 20, 1990, Atrix Laboratories, Inc. (Atrix) was substituted as
the General Partner of the Partnership and owns 1 percent of the Partnership.

    Pursuant to the partnership agreement, profits, losses, and distributions
are allocated one percent to the General Partner and ninety-nine percent to the
limited partners based on their respective ownership interests.

    CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS

         Cash equivalents include all highly liquid investments with a maturity
         of three months or less.

    RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT COSTS

         Research and development was performed for the Partnership under a
         research agreement with Atrix (Note 2).  All costs associated with the
         research were expensed as they were incurred.  Atrix allocated costs
         to the Partnership for those items which related directly to the
         research performed on behalf of the Partnership.

    GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES

         General and administrative expenses include bank service charges,
         legal fees, management fees and office expenses.

    INCOME TAXES

         The Partnership is not considered a taxable entity for federal and
         state income tax purposes.  Any taxable income or losses are reported
         by the partners on their own tax returns in accordance with the
         partnership agreement.

    LOSS PER LIMITED PARTNERSHIP INTERESTS

         The loss per limited partnership interest is calculated based on the
         5,175 limited partnership units outstanding.

2.  RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT

    Effective August 5, 1987, the Partnership entered into contracts with Atrix
to perform research and development for new therapeutic periodontal treatment
products and the development of a method of producing sanguinarine from plant
cells in tissue culture.

    Under the terms of the contracts, the Partnership made annual advance
payments to Atrix for the estimated yearly cost of the research.  The advance
payments were expensed monthly as the funds were used to perform research.
Atrix received 18.3 percent of all direct and indirect research costs as
overhead reimbursement.  During the year ended December 31, 1991, the remaining
funds raised by the Partnership were expended.  Atrix has elected to use its
funds to continue research and development activities related to the Perio
Product.

3.  RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS AND COMMITMENTS

    See Note 2 for additional related party transactions.

    The Partnership is required to pay the General Partner $12,000 annually for
management fees.  The Partnership incurred $12,000 in management fees for each
year ended December 31, 1994, 1993 and 1992.  The Partnership owed the General
Partner $131,900 at December 31, 1994 and $103,274 at December 31, 1993 for
expenses incurred by the General Partner on behalf of the Partnership.

    The Partnership's payable to the General Partner is a result of
administrative expenses being paid by the General Partner.  As the Partnership
will no longer be able to pay continued administrative expenses of the
Partnership, the General Partner has agreed to continue to fund these continued
expenses.

    Pursuant to a marketing agreement, the Partnership has granted Atrix the
exclusive right, subject to certain conditions, to manufacture and market
therapeutic periodontal treatment products (the Product), if developed.  In
exchange for the manufacturing and marketing rights, Atrix is required to pay
the Partnership quarterly royalty payments in the following amounts:  (i) 12
percent of gross sales revenues, as that term is defined in the marketing
agreement, until such time as they equal two times the gross proceeds from the
public offering of Partnership units in 1987 allocated to the research and
development of the Perio Product; (ii) thereafter, 8% of gross sales revenues
until such time as they equal an additional two times the gross proceeds from
the public offering of Partnership units in 1987 allocated to research and
development of

the Perio Product; and (iii) thereafter, 4% of gross sales revenues and
continuing until the earlier of certain events, more particularly set forth in
the marketing agreement.

    The Partnership has granted Atrix the exclusive right, but not the
obligation, to purchase all of the Partnership's right, title and interest in
the therapeutic periodontal treatment technology and products.  The exercise
price for the option is equal to two times the gross proceeds from the public
offering of the Partnership units in 1987 allocated to the research and
development of the Perio Product.  This option cannot be exercised until the
partners have received four times their initial investment relating to the
Perio Product.

                 introduced the Treatment to the commercial market place in such
                 country, then Atrix's rights hereunder shall no longer apply to

         received by Atrix and to end upon the date on which Atrix has, pursuant
         to this Agreement, paid or accrued an obligation to pay to the
         Partnership an amount equal to the Partnership's Percentage
         Contribution multiplied by $18,000,000;

                 (b) Eight (8) percent of all Gross Sales Revenues multiplied by
