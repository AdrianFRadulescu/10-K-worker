WORKING CAPITAL

Some of the companies in the recreational segment offer special payment terms
to their marine customers under certain conditions known as "dating" in the
marine industry. The dating programs have various terms but generally have the
effect that sales made during the fourth and first quarter are not collected
until the second calendar quarter. The Company feels that its line of credit is
sufficient to meet the working capital requirements of the dating program.

ITEM 6.       SELECTED FINANCIAL DATA

The response to this Item is addressed in the "Five-Year Summary" which is
included as a supplementary schedule to the Consolidated Financial Statements.

ITEM 7.       MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL
              CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

1995 COMPARED TO 1994

The Company achieved record revenues in 1995 of $75 million, an increase of $9
million (13.8%) over 1994 revenues of $66 million. The recreational group sales
increased 22.0% and the industrial group sales increased 5.6% over the prior
year. The recreational group increase was due principally to the inclusion of
Guest for a full year (acquired in June 1994). Without the inclusion of Guest,
the recreational group revenues increased 13.7%, due principally to unit volume
increases and only minor price increases.

Gross profits rose 12.1% due to the increased volume and the full year
inclusion of Guest. The gross profit margin decreased slightly from 39.0% in
1994 to 38.5% in 1995.

Consolidated selling and administrative expenses rose 12.2% in 1995 over 1994
due to the increased volume and the inclusion of Guest for a full twelve
months.

Interest expense increased 31.8 % due principally to the increase in debt used
to acquire Guest.


                                       7
<PAGE>   8
1994 COMPARED TO 1993

1994 revenues of $66 million were up 24.0% over 1993 and were a record for the
Company. The recreational group sales increased 32.9% and the industrial group
sales increased 16.3% over the prior year. The acquisition of Guest contributed
significantly to the 1994 increase in sales for the recreational group. The
balance of the sales increase was due to unit volume increases with only minor
price increases. The sales growth was fueled by new product development
programs and by the continued strength in the marine industry.

Gross profits rose 24.1% due to the volume increases and the acquisition of
Guest. The gross profit margin percentage remained the same from 1993 to 1994
at 39.0%.

Consolidated selling and administrative expenses rose 18.4% to $19.8 million in
1994 over 1993. The increase was principally attributable to the acquisition of
Guest, increases in selling expenses which vary directly with sales, and
increased engineering and research expenditures. In the second quarter of 1994,
the Company recorded a nonrecurring charge of $130 thousand for moving expenses
associated with the relocation of Marinco and AFI to a new facility.

Interest expense increased 70.8% to $914 thousand due principally to the
increase in debt used to acquire Guest.

Other income (expense) includes a $450 thousand charge to write down a building
held for sale to its estimated net realizable value.

LIQUIDITY AND SOURCES OF CAPITAL

Cash provided by operating activities increased from $2.2 million in 1994 to
$4.6 million in 1995. This net $2.4 million increase is primarily due to the
fact that the Company invested an additional $3.3 million in inventories during
1994 compared to $374 thousand in 1995, a difference of $2.9 million. The major
investment in inventories during 1994 was necessitated by the sales growth in
that year over 1993 (24%) and new product introductions.

The Company borrowed $11 million in June 1994 to purchase the assets of Guest
for $6.5 million and to pay down short-term borrowings on the bank line of
credit. This new debt requires annual principal payments of $1 million
beginning in June 1996.

The Company had a bank line of credit of $6 million available and unused at
December 31, 1995. The Company also had an advanceable term loan due June 30,
1998, providing for borrowings up to $3.5 million bearing interest at the prime
rate plus 0.5%. This advanceable term loan is intended to be used to fund
acquisitions. At December 31, 1995, $850 thousand was outstanding on this
advanceable term loan.


                                       8
<PAGE>   9
The Company borrowed $850 thousand from certain officers and shareholders
during the year at 1.25% over the current 90 day Treasury bill rate. This
resulted in a savings of approximately 1.5% to 2.0% over comparable borrowings
during the same periods at the prime rate on the bank line of credit.

The Company invested $2.9 million in plant and equipment during 1995, which is
approximately 75% higher than depreciation charges during the year of $1.6
million. Management estimates that 1996 capital expenditures will be
approximately $3.5 million, including approximately $1.25 million in expanded
operating facilities for two subsidiaries.

The Company merged the operations of Marinco and AFI with both companies moving
to a newly constructed facility on November 1, 1994. The facility was sold on
January 18, 1995, to an unrelated party and leased back for a period of 15
years. The facility formerly occupied by AFI was sold in August 1995 for $242
thousand cash and a $600 thousand promissory note.

Approximately $600 thousand was used to pay cash dividends in 1995. On December
6, 1995, the Company's Board of Director's authorized a three-for-two stock
split effected in the form of a 50% stock dividend to be distributed on March
12, 1996, to shareholders of record on March 1, 1996. In conjunction with the
stock split, the Company also adjusted the 1996 cash dividend rate to $.06 per
share (see Note A to the Consolidated Financial Statements). The dividend rate
for 1995 was $.0567 per share. The total dividend payments for 1996 are
expected to be $650 thousand.

Management believes that cash flow from operations, the bank line of credit and
the term credit facility will provide sufficient liquidity to fund working
capital requirements, capital expenditures, potential business acquisitions,
debt repayments, and dividends for the next twelve months.

EFFECTS OF INFLATION AND OTHER MATTERS

Inflation had little effect on revenues and related costs during 1995.
Management anticipates that margins will be maintained at acceptable levels to
minimize the effect of inflation, if any.

The Company has total interest bearing debt of approximately $13.75 million, of
which one obligation of $11 million is long-term and bears interest at a fixed
rate of 8.15%. Management believes that increases in short-term rates should
not have a material adverse effect on the Company's 1996 results since there is
relatively little exposure to short term rates.

Management believes that foreign currency fluctuations should not have a
significant impact on gross margins due to the low volume of business affected
by foreign currencies.

The Company is not aware of any significant environmental loss liabilities.
Management believes product liabilities are adequately covered by general
liability insurance.

                       REPORT OF INDEPENDENT ACCOUNTANTS

To the Board of Directors and
         Stockholders of Valley Forge Corporation:

We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Valley Forge
Corporation and Subsidiaries as of December 31, 1995, and 1994, and the related
consolidated statements of income, stockholders' equity, and cash flows for
each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 1995. These financial
statements are the responsibility of the Company's management. Our
responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements based on
our audits.

We conducted our audits in accordance with generally accepted auditing
standards. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of
material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence
supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. An audit
also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant
estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial
statement presentation.  We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis
for our opinion.

In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present fairly, in
all material respects, the consolidated financial position of Valley Forge
Corporation and Subsidiaries as of December 31, 1995, and 1994, and the
consolidated results of their operations and their cash flows for each of the
three years in the period ended December 31, 1995, in conformity with generally
accepted accounting principles.

                    VALLEY FORGE CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES
                   NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

NOTE A - SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

PRINCIPLES OF CONSOLIDATION
The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Valley Forge
Corporation and all its majority-owned subsidiaries (the Company). All
significant intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated. The
preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted
accounting principles requires management estimates and assumptions that affect
the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent
assets and liabilities and the reported results of operations. Actual results
could differ from these estimates.

STOCK SPLIT
On December 6, 1995, the Company's Board of Directors authorized a
three-for-two stock split effected in the form of a 50 percent stock dividend
distributed on March 12, 1996, to stockholders of record on March 1, 1996.
Accordingly, all references in the financial statements to numbers of shares,
per share amounts, stock option data, and market prices of the Company's common
stock have been retroactively restated. In addition, $444,000 representing the
par value of the additional shares issued has been reclassified from Capital in
Excess of Par Value to Common Stock.

CASH EQUIVALENTS
The Company considers all highly liquid investments with original maturities of
three months or less to be cash equivalents.

INVENTORIES
Inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market. Cost for certain
inventories in the industrial group segment is determined using the last-in,
first-out (LIFO) method. The cost of all other inventories is determined using
the first-in, first-out (FIFO) method.

PROPERTY, PLANT, AND EQUIPMENT
Property, plant, and equipment is stated at cost. Depreciation is primarily
provided by the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the
various assets. When assets are sold or retired, the cost and accumulated
depreciation are removed from the accounts and any gain or loss is included in
income.

GOODWILL
Goodwill is stated at cost and is amortized on a straight-line basis over
various periods ranging from fifteen to forty years. The Company periodically
evaluates the recoverability of its goodwill by comparing the aggregate
estimated future cash flows generated by those assets with their carrying
value.  If the carrying value exceeds the aggregate cash flow amount, goodwill
would be reduced accordingly.



                                       26
<PAGE>   27
FOREIGN CURRENCY TRANSLATION
Assets and liabilities of the Company's foreign operation are translated at
year end exchange rates while the income statement accounts are translated
using an average exchange rate for the year. Translation adjustments arising
from the translation of foreign assets and liabilities into U.S. dollars are
recorded as a separate component of stockholders' equity.

INCOME TAXES
The Company accounts for income taxes using the liability method. Deferred
income tax assets and liabilities are computed annually for differences between
the financial statement and tax bases of assets and liabilities that will
result in taxable or deductible amounts in the future based on enacted tax laws
and rates applicable to the periods in which the differences are expected to
affect taxable income. Valuation allowances are established when necessary to
reduce deferred tax assets to the amount expected to be realized.

NET INCOME PER SHARE
Net income per share is based on the weighted average number of common shares
and equivalents outstanding during the year. There is no difference between
primary and fully diluted net income per share for the years presented.

CONCENTRATION OF CREDIT RISK
The Company sells its recreational and industrial products to original
equipment manufacturers, dealers, and distributors located in the United States
and throughout the world. The Company performs ongoing credit evaluations of
its customers and generally does not require collateral. The Company maintains
reserves for potential credit losses.

FINANCIAL STATEMENT RECLASSIFICATION AND PRESENTATION
Certain reclassifications have been made to prior years' financial statements
to conform to the 1995 presentation.

NOTE B - INVENTORIES

The weighted average interest rate on the above revolving credit note and
short-term notes during 1995 was 8.30%.

In January 1995, the Company repaid a construction loan of $1,728,000 using the
proceeds from the sale of the constructed facility. A subsidiary has leased

NOTE I - RETIREMENT PLANS

The Company sponsors a profit sharing plan for all non-union employees at
several subsidiaries. Under this plan, contributions are discretionary and

expense for this plan for 1995, 1994, and 1993 was approximately $ 180,000,
$175,000, and $167,000, respectively.

The Company has a 401(k) plan which covers all employees at domestic locations
in which the Company has an ownership interest in excess of 80%. Employee
contributions of up to 3% of each covered employee's compensation are matched
100% by the Company. Employer contributions to the plan were approximately
$273,000, $211,000, and $196,000, in 1995, 1994, and 1993, respectively.

In May 1993, Multiplex Technology, Inc. (Multiplex) adopted a 401(k) plan which

requirements of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act ("ERISA") of 1974.
The assets of the Plan are managed and invested by an insurance company.

The funded status of the Plan and the components of net periodic defined
benefit pension cost are set forth in the following table. The rates used in
determining the actuarial present value of the benefit obligations at December
31 were (i) discount rate - 6.0% in 1995 and 7.75% in 1994, and (ii) the
expected long-term rate of return on assets - 8.75% in both 1995 and 1994.
Benefit obligations are sensitive to changes in these estimated rates and
actual results may differ from the estimated obligations below (in thousands).

NOTE L - ACQUISITIONS

On June 1, 1994, Atlantic Guest, Inc. (Guest), a newly formed subsidiary of
Valley Forge Corporation, acquired substantially all of the assets of The Guest
Company, Inc. for a purchase price of approximately $6.5 million in cash and
the assumption of certain liabilities totaling $392,000. Guest, located in
Meriden, Connecticut, is a manufacturer of marine products including battery
chargers, battery switches, and lighting products. The purchase price in excess
of net tangible assets acquired, approximately $4.6 million, has been recorded
as goodwill and is being amortized over 15 years.

Guest is owned 86% by the Company and 7% each by two officers of the
subsidiary.  In connection with the formation of Guest, each officer issued a
note due to the Company for $150,500 which bears interest at 8.15% and is due
May 31, 1997. The notes and accrued interest totaling approximately $315,000
are secured by Guest stock and are therefore recorded as a reduction of
minority interest. The Company entered into an agreement with the officers
whereby the officers may require the Company to purchase their shares of stock
at book value. The Company's total purchase obligation shall not exceed $75,000
in any twelve-month period. The Company also has right of first refusal to buy
the officers' stock.

The Company's results of operations include the results of Guest since June 1,
1994. The unaudited pro forma results of operations had this acquisition
occurred on January 1, 1993, are as follows (in thousands, except per share
amounts).

</TABLE>


The pro forma financial data reflects adjustments for amortization of goodwill
and the additional interest expense that would have been incurred on the
related increase in debt.

In connection with the Company's acquisition of a 66% ownership interest in
Multiplex in 1991, the Company entered into an agreement with all Multiplex
common stock and option holders whereby they may require the Company to
purchase their shares of Multiplex up to a maximum of $200,000 a year. Under
certain circumstances, the Company may have an obligation to purchase all of
the then outstanding common stock of Multiplex. The Multiplex stock is valued
at the time of purchase based on an earnings formula. As of December 31, 1995,
the total purchase obligation would be approximately $1,800,000. Under these
agreements the Company has purchased a total of 11,168 shares for approximately
$162,000.

Since 1993, the Company has invested $1,087,000 in product line and other
business acquisitions.

The Company has Canadian tax net operating loss carryforwards of approximately
$207,000 and Canadian research and development expense carryforwards of
approximately $265,000 available to offset future Canadian taxable income. The
net operating loss carryforwards will expire in the years 2000 and 2002. The
research and development expense carryforwards have no expiration period. The
Company also has Canadian research and development credit carryforwards
totaling approximately $53,000 available to offset future Canadian taxable
income. These credits expire in various years from 2000 through 2005.

The valuation allowance for deferred income tax assets relates to the
realizability of tax net operating loss, research and development expense, and
tax credit carryforwards by the Company's Canadian subsidiary. The net change
in the valuation allowance during 1995 was $13,000.

For the year ended December 31, 1995, the Company utilized pre-acquisition net
operating loss and general business credit carryforwards. The associated
benefits of $25,000 were reflected as a reduction of goodwill. For the year
ended December 31, 1994, there was no utilization of pre-acquisition net
operating loss or general business credit carryforwards.

The differences between the statutory and effective tax rates on income are as
follows:
