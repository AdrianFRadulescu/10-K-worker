                         Part I. Registrant Information

Full name of registrant      URT Industries, Inc.

Former name if applicable    not applicable

Address of principal executive office (street and number)

                      1180 East Hallandale Beach Boulevard

City, State and Zip Code       Hallandale, Florida 33009

                         Part II, Rule 12b-25(b) and (c)

     If the subject report could not be filed without unreasonable effort or
expense and the registrant seeks relief pursuant to Rule 12b-25(b), the
following should be completed. (Check appropriate box.)

[ x ] (a) The reasons described in reasonable detail in Part III of this form
      could not be eliminated without unreasonable effort or expense;


<PAGE>



[ x ] (b) The subject annual report, semi-annual report, transition report on
      Form 10-K, 20-F, 11-K or Form N-SAR, or portion thereof will be filed on 
      or before the 15th calendar day following the prescribed due date; or the

                               Part III. Narrative

     State below in reasonable detail the reasons why Form 10-K, 11-K, 20-F,
10-Q, N-SAR or the transition report portion thereof could not be filed within
the prescribed time period.

          The registrant's 87%-owned operating subsidiary, Peaches Entertainment
          Corporation ("PEC"), filed a voluntary petition for relief under
          Chapter 11 of the United States Bankruptcy Code on January 16, 1996
          and is operating its business as a debtor-in- possession. PEC is
          scheduled to file its Plan of Reorganization with the Bankruptcy Court
          on July 15, 1996. The volume of filings and other work required in
          connection with such Plan of Reorganization and other matters relating
          to the bankruptcy proceeding prevent the registrant from completing
          the Form 10-K on a timely basis.

                           Part IV. Other Information

     (1) Name and telephone number of person to contact in regard to this
notification

 Jason Wolk                    954                  454-5555
   (Name)                  (Area code)          (Telephone number)

     (2) Have all other periodic reports required under Section 13 or 15(d) of
the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 or Section 30 of the Investment Company Act
of 1940 during the preceding 12 months or for such shorter period that the
registrant was required to file such report(s) been filed? If the answer is no,
identify report(s)

                                        [ x ] Yes        [   ] No

     (3) Is it anticipated that any significant change in results of operations
from the corresponding period for the last fiscal year will be reflected by the
earnings statements to be included in the subject report or portion thereof?

                                        [ x ] Yes       [   ] No

     If so: attach an explanation of the anticipated change, both narratively
and quantitatively, and, if appropriate, state the reasons why a reasonable
estimate of the results cannot be made.

          A significant change in results of operations from the corresponding
          period for the last fiscal year will be reflected by the earnings
          statement to be included in the subject report due, among other
          considerations, to: the closing of 6 of PEC's 19 stores during the
          period


<PAGE>


          covered by the subject filing; the filing by PEC for relief under
          Chapter 11 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code on January 16, 1996; a change
          in the credit and other terms of PEC's arrangements with its
          suppliers, as a result of such bankruptcy filing; the termination of
          certain executory agreements as a result of such bankruptcy filing;
          and other circumstances pertaining to the bankruptcy filing and its
          effect on PEC's business. As a result of such developments, management
          estimates that from the one year period ended April 1, 1995 to the one
          year period ended March 30, 1996, the financial statements to be
          incorporated in the subject filing will reflect, among other changes,
          a decrease in net sales from approximately $31.9 million to
          approximately $15.2 million, an increase in net loss from
          approximately $1.7 million to approximately $2.2 million, and a
          decrease in working capital from approximately $5.1 million to
          approximately $3.6 million.

                              URT Industries, Inc.

                  (Name of registrant as specified in charter)

Has caused this notification to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned
thereunto duly authorized.
