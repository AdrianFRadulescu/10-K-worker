                                     PART I


Item 1.  BUSINESS

         URT Industries,  Inc. ("URT" or the "Company"),  a Florida corporation,
was incorporated in 1967, the year it succeeded to the business of two companies
which had  commenced  operations in 1961 and 1965,  respectively.  Its executive
offices are located at 3451 Executive Way, Miramar, Florida 33025. Its telephone
number is 305-432-4200.

         Since 1981,  URT has been  engaged in the  operation  of retail  stores
which  sell  prerecorded  music,  videos,  and  related  products  (the  "Retail
Business")  in the  Southeastern  part  of the  United  States  under  the  name
"PEACHES".  Such business is operated by its subsidiary,  Peaches  Entertainment
Corporation  ("PEC"),  a Florida  corporation.  URT owns all of PEC's issued and
outstanding  shares of preferred stock and  approximately  87% of its issued and
outstanding  shares of common  stock.  The remaining  approximately  13% of such
common stock is owned by non-affiliated persons.


The Peaches Stores

         The following  table sets forth the number of stores which were open at
the beginning of the year, which opened during the year, which closed during the
year and which were open at the end of the year, with respect to URT's last five
complete fiscal years ended April 1, 1995:


                                        1995     1994     1993     1992     1991
                                        ----     ----     ----     ----     ----
Number of stores:

  At beginning of period ..........      20       21       22       21       20
  Opened during period ............       1        0        0        2        2
  Closed during period ............      (2)      (1)      (1)      (1)      (1)
                                         --       --       --       --       --
  At end of period ................      19       20       21       22       21

         Between  April 1,  1995 and the date of this  filing,  PEC  closed  two
additional  stores,  leaving,  at present,  a total of 17 "Peaches"  stores (the
"'Peaches'  stores") in operation  in five  states.  Such states are Florida (10
stores), Virginia (3


                                      -2-


<PAGE>


stores),  North  Carolina  (2 stores),  South  Carolina (1 store) and Alabama (1
store). PEC does not have any present plans to open any additional stores during
the 1996 fiscal year.

       PEC leases all but one of its stores. It has options to renew most of its
leases  for  various  periods.  The  utilized  space of the stores  ranges  from
approximately 7,000 square feet to approximately  14,000 square feet. Each store
either  has its own  parking  area or is  located  in a  shopping  center  which
provides parking.

       Two of the  Florida  stores,  one in Fort  Lauderdale  and the  other  in
Orlando, are currently leased from the Chairman of URT and his brother, a former
director  of URT.  The store in North  Miami  Beach,  Florida is leased from two
directors and two children of such former director.  See "Certain  Relationships
and Related Transactions".

       For information concerning real property owned by PEC, see "Properties".


Trademarks

       PEC  is the  registered  owner  of  and  owns  nationwide  rights  to the
tradename, service mark and trademark "PEACHES" (the "Trademarks") in connection
with the operation of the Retail Business.


Operation of the Peaches Stores

       The "Peaches"  stores are all similar in appearance.  They have distinct,
wood  panelled  interiors,  are decorated in a manner which  identifies  them as
"Peaches"  stores and carry a wide  selection  of  prerecorded  music as well as
recorded  and blank video tapes,  accessory  items and  specialty  items such as
T-shirts and crates.  Some stores are free standing and others are contiguous to
other stores in shopping centers. At present, each "Peaches" store is managed by
an individual  director who is responsible for ordering,  pricing and displaying
merchandise  sold in the store,  hiring and firing  personnel  and other matters
relating to store administration.  PEC has implemented a computerized  inventory
control system at each of its stores.

         As of May 15, 1995, PEC purchased  merchandise  from  approximately  54
suppliers, among whom the principal ones were BMG, CEMA, PGD, SONY, UNI and WEA.
Approximately 77% of the


                                      -3-


<PAGE>


merchandise  purchased  during  the fiscal  year ended  April 1, 1995 (the "1995
fiscal  year")  came from such six  principal  suppliers.  Purchases  from given
suppliers are, to a great extent,  determined by which of them are manufacturing
or distributing the most popular prerecorded music products at a given time. PEC
is not  obligated to purchase  merchandise  from any  supplier.  It has numerous
alternate sources of supply for inventory.  The loss of any particular  supplier
would not have a  materially  negative  effect on PEC's  results of  operations,
although in some cases, the expenses would be greater if such alternate  sources
were utilized.  Merchandise is generally  delivered directly by suppliers to the
stores.

       The usual terms  received from  suppliers  provide for payment to be made
within  60 days  from  the end of the  month  in which a  purchase  is made.  In
addition,  PEC normally receives an additional 30 to 120 days to pay for certain
purchases during the course of the year. Such terms are usual in the industry.

       Under  current  industry  practice,  PEC is able to  return  merchandise,
without  limitation,  to all  suppliers,  who charge a slight penalty if returns
exceed certain  percentages of the dollar amounts of gross purchases.  Up to the
present time, the suppliers'  return policies have not had any adverse effect on
PEC's business.

       Advertising in local  newspapers and media is determined by  consultation
between each store director and PEC management.  PEC also engages in cooperative
advertising  with  suppliers  who pay a portion of the cost.  In addition to the
director, each "Peaches" store is staffed with managers,  cashiers and sales and
stock  room  personnel.  The  stores  are  open  seven  days a  week.  Based  on
management's experience to date, retail business sales fluctuate during the year
and are  generally at their  highest  levels  during the holiday  season,  i.e.,
between October and December.  During the last three fiscal years, sales between
January and March were  approximately  24% of total  sales for each year;  sales
between April and June were approximately 23% of total sales; sales between July
and September were  approximately  22% of total sales; and sales between October
and December were approximately 31% of total sales.


Competition

         The  retail  sale of  prerecorded  music and video  products  is highly
competitive.  There are hundreds of retail stores and  department,  discount and
variety stores and supermarkets which


                                      -4-


<PAGE>


offer such  merchandise  to the public.  PEC's share of the retail market in the
Southeastern  United States is not significant.  Recently,  in addition to usual
competition,  there has been a proliferation of  non-traditional  music outlets,
such as appliance and computer retailers and superbookstores,  some of whom have
used very aggresive price cutting tactics  including selling some products below
actual cost in order to attract customers and sell non-music and video products.


Employees

       As of May 5, 1995,  URT and PEC employed  340 persons in all  capacities.
Neither  URT  nor  PEC is a  party  to  any  collective  bargaining  agreements.
Relations  with  employees  have been  satisfactory  and there have been no work
stoppages.


Management Agreement Between URT and PEC

       On April 3, 1994, when the 1995 fiscal year began, a management agreement
was  in  effect  between  URT  and  PEC  (hereinafter,  collectively,  the  "URT
Companies").  Such  agreement  provided  that it would remain in effect  through
March 30, 1996; that PEC would pay URT an annual fee of 3-1/2% of its net sales,
subject to a maximum amount of  $1,400,000;  that URT would provide PEC with the
services of Allan Wolk as president  and chairman of PEC; that URT would pay PEC
for certain accounting and administrative  services performed by PEC at the rate
of $39,600 per annum (subject to periodic  equitable  adjustment  depending upon
the amount of such services); and that so long as URT and PEC filed consolidated
income  tax  returns,  their  respective  liabilities  for such  taxes  would be
equitably apportioned as provided in such agreement.  Such agreement was amended
as of October 2, 1994 to provide that for the above described services,  instead
of the compensation  described above, PEC would be required to pay URT, in equal
weekly  installments,  a fee of $500,000  during the period from October 2, 1994
through April 1, 1995 and a fee at the rate of $750,000 per annum for the period
from April 2, 1995 until  March 30,  1996.  During both the 1994 and 1995 fiscal
years, Mr. Wolk devoted approximately 75% of his working time to the business of
PEC. As a result of the above-described arrangements,  PEC paid URT a management
fee of $1,024,386  for the 1995 fiscal year,  as compared to $1,263,010  for the
1994 fiscal  year,  and URT paid  expenses as described  above of  approximately
$39,600 for each of such fiscal years.

Item 2.  PROPERTIES

         The URT Companies'  headquarters  are located in Miramar,  Florida in a
building which is leased by PEC. Such building contains a total of approximately
26,000  square feet,  approximately  11,000 square feet of which is office space
and approximately 15,000 square feet of which is warehouse space.

         PEC owns real property in Mobile,  Alabama on which it constructed  and
operates a "Peaches"  store.  Such property is subject to a first mortgage.  All
other "Peaches" stores are leased. For information  concerning such other stores
operated by PEC, see "Business--The Peaches Stores".

         During  the  1995  fiscal  year,   PEC  purchased  land  in  Lafayette,
Louisiana,  with the intention of constructing a store. However, it subsequently
decided not to construct a store and,  after the end of such fiscal  year,  sold
the land for an amount approximately equal to its original purchase price.


Item 3.  LEGAL PROCEEDINGS

         In April, 1991, Service Merchandise Company, Inc. ("Service") commenced
an action against PEC in the North Carolina  General Court of Justice,  Superior
Court Division,  Mecklenburg County,  based on PEC's closing of a store which it
had leased in Charlotte, North Carolina and its refusal to pay rent with respect
to such store from and after February,  1991.  Before closing the store, PEC had
attempted to sublease it to a subtenant,  but Service  refused to consent to the
sublease.  In such action,  Service  sought a judgment for rent arrears plus its
reasonable  attorneys' fees and expenses,  and for an order requiring PEC to pay
the rent  required to be paid under the lease  through July 31,  1997,  less any
amounts  recovered  from a current  tenant or any  subsequent  occupant  of such
premises.  PEC asserted  various  defenses  including  the failure of Service to
mitigate  damages by refusing to consent to the  sublease of the premises by PEC
to a  financially  responsible  and  reputable  company.  Following  a trial  in
December, 1993, a judgment was issued in favor of Service in February, 1995, for
rent due to such date and PEC remains  liable  under the lease  through July 31,
1997.  Under  such  judgment  PEC was  ordered  to pay the  sum of  $405,460  to
plaintiff, which amount was duly paid by PEC to Service in March, 1995.

Item 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL
        CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

FISCAL YEAR ENDED APRIL 1, 1995 (1995) COMPARED TO FISCAL YEAR ENDED APRIL 2,
1994 (1994)

Net sales for 1995 decreased 12.0% compared to 1994. Such decrease is attributed
to an 8.2% decrease in comparable store sales, and a 3.8% decrease in sales in
those stores that opened or closed during 1995 versus 1994.

During the last few years, non-traditional music retailers such as appliance and
computer retailers and super bookstores have begun to sell prerecorded music and
video products. They have adopted policies of selling music product at near or
below wholesale cost as a means of attracting customers to sell other products.
During the current fiscal year, the effect of this competition was encountered
in some of our markets and will be expanded to some others in the future. The
Company has reduced prices which has resulted in lower sales and lower gross
profit. The Company believes that it will remain competitive due to its
locations, selection of product and superior customer service.

The cost of sales for 1995 was lower than that for 1994 due to a decrease in net
sales. Cost of sales as a percentage of net sales has increased from 62.7% in
1994 to 63.7% in 1995 due to a reduction in retail pricing in an effort to meet
the increased competition.

Selling, general, and administrative (SG&A) expenses in 1995 decreased 6.8%
compared to 1994. Such decrease is attributable to a decrease in comparable
store expenses (1.0%), a decrease in store operating expenses of stores that
opened or closed during 1995 versus 1994 (2.6%), a decrease in corporate
overhead (2.8%), and a decrease in the cost of store openings (0.4%). SG&A
expenses, as a percentage of net sales increased from 37.4% in 1994 to 39.7% in
1995 due to the fixed nature of certain expenses and the decrease in net sales
in addition to the aforementioned items.

Store closing costs increased in 1995 over 1994 due to the fact that the cost of
closing 1 store is included in 1994, and the cost of closing 4 stores is
included in 1995.

In 1994, the Company adopted the provisions of Financial Standards No. 109 (SFAS
109) "Accounting for Income Taxes," which established new financial accounting
and reporting standards for income taxes. Such adoption resulted in a cumulative
adjustment of approximately $74,000 of income which has been reflected in the
statement of operations for 1994.

The Company incurred a net loss of approximately $1,759,000 in 1995 versus a net
loss of approximately $153,000 in 1994 due to costs of closing 4 stores, the
loss on litigation, and the reduction in net sales and gross profit as described
above.

<PAGE>


FISCAL YEAR ENDED APRIL 2, 1994 (1994) COMPARED TO FISCAL YEAR ENDED APRIL 3,
1993 (1993)

Net sales for 1994 decreased 4.1% compared to 1993. Such decrease is attributed
to the fact that 1993 included 53 weeks of operations (1.7%), a decrease in
comparable store sales (1.6%), store closings due to inclement weather (0.3%)
and a decrease in sales in those stores that opened or closed during 1994 versus
1993 (0.5%).

The cost of sales for 1994 was lower than that for 1993 due to decreased net
sales. Cost of sales as a percentage of net sales for both 1994 and 1993 was
62.7%.

Selling, general, and administrative (SG&A) expenses in 1994 increased 1.3%
compared to 1993. Such increase is attributable to an increase in comparable
store expense (1.7%), an increase in corporate overhead (1.2%), an increase in
the cost of store openings (0.7%), offset by a decrease in store expenses that
opened or closed during 1994 versus 1993 (1.4%), and a decrease due to the fact
that 1993 included 53 weeks of operations (0.9%). SG&A expenses, as a percentage
of net sales increased from 35.4% in 1993 to 37.4% in 1994 due to the fixed
nature of certain expenses and the decrease in net sales in addition to the
aforementioned items.

In 1994, the Company adopted the provisions of Financial Standards No. 109 (SFAS
109) "Accounting for Income Taxes," which established new financial accounting
and reporting standards for income taxes. Such adoption resulted in a cumulative
adjustment of approximately $74,000 of income which has been reflected in the
statement of operations for 1994.

The Company incurred a net loss of approximately $153,000 in 1994 versus net
income of approximately $291,000 in 1993 due to the decrease in net sales and an
increase in certain SG&A expenses as discussed above. Approximately $55,000 of
net income in 1993 is due to the fact that 1993 included 53 weeks of operations.

FISCAL YEAR ENDED APRIL 3, 1993 (1993) COMPARED TO FISCAL YEAR ENDED MARCH 28,
1992 (1992)

Net sales for 1993 increased 6.4% compared to 1992. Such increase is
attributable to the fact that 1993 included 53 weeks of operations (1.8%), an
increase in comparable store sales (3.8%), and an increase in sales in those
stores that opened or closed during 1993 versus 1992 (0.8%).

Cost of sales for 1993 increased compared to 1992 due primarily to increased
sales volume as described above. Cost of sales as a percentage of net sales for
1993 (62.7%) was lower than that for 1992 (63.7%) due to the amortization of
$131,000 relating to the cost of video cassettes, which were test marketed and
discounted in 1992.

Selling, general, and administrative (SG&A) expenses for 1993 decreased 0.1%
compared to 1992. Such decrease is attributable to a decrease in expenses of
comparable stores (2.2%), an increase in expenses of stores opened or closed in
1993 versus 1992 (0.9%), an increase attributable to the fact that 1993 included
53 weeks of operations (0.9%), an increase in corporate overhead (0.1%), and an
increase in expenses incurred in connection with the opening of stores (0.2%).
SG&A expenses, as a percentage of net sales decreased from 38.0% in 1992 to
35.4% in 1993 due to the fixed nature of certain expenses and the increase in
net sales.

Store closing costs increased in 1993 over 1992 because the costs incurred with
the closing of the store due to Hurricane Andrew in 1993 was higher than the
negligible cost of closing the store in 1992.

The Company achieved net income of approximately $290,000 in 1993 versus a net
loss of approximately $269,000 in 1992 due to the increase in net sales which
was partially offset by the increases in certain SG&A expenses as discussed
above. Approximately $55,000 of net income in 1993 is due to the fact that 1993
included 53 weeks of operations.

Liquidity and Capital Resources

The Company had working capital of $5,168,136 at April 1, 1995 compared to
working capital of $6,651,083 at April 2, 1994 and a current ratio (the ratio of
total current assets to total current liabilities) of 1.86 to 1 at April 1, 1995
compared to a current ratio of 2.05 to 1 at April 2, 1994.

The Company has historically maintained a strong cash position and management
believes that this will continue in the future.

At April 1, 1995, the Company had long-term obligations of $929,654. Management
anticipates that its ability to repay its long-term obligations will be
satisfied primarily through funds generated from its operations.

Management believes that the Company has excellent relationships with its banks
and suppliers and does not anticipate any significant difficulties in financing
operations at current levels.

Management anticipates that cash generated from operations and cash equivalents
on hand will provide sufficient liquidity to maintain adequate working capital
for operations and the opening of any new stores during the next few years.

Inflation trends have not had an impact upon revenues because increases in costs
have been passed along to customers.

The Company's business is seasonal in nature, with the highest sales and
earnings occurring in the third fiscal quarter, which includes the Christmas
selling season.

In July 1995, the Company will be selling its leasehold in a store to the
landlord for $325,000.

                      URT INDUSTRIES, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES

                   Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements

                 April 1, 1995, April 2, 1994 and April 3, 1993


(1)      Business and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies

         (a)    Business

                URT Industries, Inc. and subsidiaries (the "Company") is engaged
                in the  business  of  retailing  prerecorded  music,  video  and
                accessory items, principally in the southeastern United States.

         (b)    Fiscal Year

                The Company's  fiscal year consists of the 52 or 53 weeks ending
                on the  Saturday  closest to the end of March.  The fiscal years
                ended April 1, 1995,  April 2, 1994 and April 3, 1993  consisted
                of 52 weeks, 52 weeks and 53 weeks, respectively.

         (c)    Principles of Consolidation

                The consolidated  financial  statements  include the accounts of
                URT   Industries,   Inc.  and  its  wholly  owned   nonoperating
                subsidiary,  whose  business was  discontinued  in 1984, and its
                87%-owned  subsidiary,  Peaches Entertainment  Corporation.  All
                significant  intercompany  balances and  transactions  have been
                eliminated.  Reference to the Company  encompasses any or all of
                the aforementioned entities.

         (d)    Cash Equivalents

                The Company considers highly liquid  investments  purchased with
                original   maturities  of  three  months  or  less  to  be  cash
                equivalents. Cash equivalents totaled $486,192 and $4,816,000 at
                April 1, 1995 and April 2, 1994, respectively.

                The Company has an  agreement to purchase  securities  overnight
                under agreements to resell ("repos"). At April 1, 1995 and April
                2, 1994, the outstanding  repos,  included  above,  approximated
                $385,000  and  $1,559,000,   respectively,   which  approximated
                market. The repos are collaterized by U.S. Government and agency
                securities.

         (e)    Marketable Investment Securities

                The Company adopted Statement of Financial  Accounting Standards
                No. 115 ("SFAS 115"), Accounting for Certain Investments in Debt
                and Equity  Securities,  effective  April 3, 1994.  There was no
                cumulative  effect as a result of adopting SFAS 115 in 1995. The
                Company  invests  in  short-term  cash  investments   which  are
                classified  as  available-for-sale  at  April  1,  1995  and are
                comprised of treasury  bills with  maturities  not exceeding one
                year. The carrying amount approximates fair value because of the
                short maturity of these instruments.


                                                                     (Continued)

                      URT INDUSTRIES, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES

                   Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements


         (f)    Inventories

                Inventories,  comprised of compact discs, cassettes,  videos and
                accessories,  are  stated  at the  lower  of  cost  (principally
                average) including freight in, or market.

         (g)    Property and Equipment

                Property  and  equipment  are  stated at cost.  The  assets  are
                depreciated  over their estimated useful lives ranging from 5 to
                31-1/2 years using both  straight-line and accelerated  methods.
                The  Company's  policy is to retire  assets from its accounts as
                they become fully depreciated.

         (h)    Income Taxes

                The  Company  files a  consolidated  income tax return  with its
                subsidiaries.  Provision is made for deferred income taxes which
                result from certain items of income and expense  being  reported
                for tax purposes in periods  different  than those  reported for
                financial reporting purposes.  These items relate principally to
                the methods of accounting for store leases with future scheduled
                rent  payment  increases,   inventory  and  the  utilization  of
                different  methods of depreciation  for financial  statement and
                income tax purposes.

                Effective  April 4, 1993, the Company  adopted the provisions of
                Financial  Accounting Standards Board's SFAS No. 109, Accounting
                for Income Taxes and has reported the cumulative  effect of that
                change  in the  method of  accounting  for  income  taxes in the
                consolidated  statements  of  operations.  Under  the  asset and
                liability  method  of SFAS No.  109,  deferred  tax  assets  and
                liabilities  are  recognized  for the  future  tax  consequences
                attributable  to  differences  between the  financial  statement
                carrying  amounts of existing  assets and  liabilities and their
                respective tax bases.  Deferred tax assets and  liabilities  are
                measured  using  enacted tax rates  expected to apply to taxable
                income in the years in which  those  temporary  differences  are
                expected to be  recovered  or settled.  Under SFAS No. 109,  the
                effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax
                rates is  recognized  in income in the period that  includes the
                enactment date.

         (i)    Income (Loss) Per Common Share

                Income  (loss) per common  share was  computed by  dividing  net
                income  (loss) by the weighted  average  number of common shares
                outstanding  during  each of the periods  which was  12,674,448,
                12,695,136  and  12,594,531  for the years  ended April 1, 1995,
                April 2, 1994 and April 3, 1993, respectively.

         (j)    Store Closing Costs

                Store  closing  costs are  recorded  in the period  the  Company
                decides to close the store. Such costs include the book value of
                abandoned  leasehold  improvements,  provision  for the  present
                value of future lease  obligations,  less  estimated  sub-rental
                income as well as other costs incident to the store closing.


                                                                     (Continued)

         (k)    Reclassifications

                Certain  amounts  in the 1994 and  1993  consolidated  financial
                statements  have  been  reclassified  to  conform  with the 1995
                presentation.

            Unsecured loans made to two officers/shareholders;
                proceeds of the loans were used to purchase shares
                of the Company's Class A and Class B common
                stock in the open market from an unrelated party     $ 168,020      194,305

</TABLE>

         The promissory note agreements with the two  officers/shareholders  are
         payable  with   interest  at 8%  in  96  equal,   consecutive   monthly
         installments through March 31, 2000.

         Under   amended  and   restated   employment   agreements   with  these
         officers/shareholders  [see note 6(c)], the required loan payments will
         be credited as compensation for the two officers/shareholders.

(6)      Commitments and Contingencies

         (a)    Leases

                The Company is a lessee under various operating leases,  several
                of which provide for percentage rent. An insignificant amount of
                percentage  rent  was  incurred  in  each  of the  years  in the
                three-year  period  ended  April  1,  1995.  Most of the  leases
                contain renewal options.

                The aggregate minimum rental commitments under all noncancelable
                operating leases are as follows:

                   Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements


                Rental expense under noncancelable operating leases, included in
                selling, general and administrative expenses in the accompanying
                consolidated  statements of operations,  amounted to $2,410,000,
                $2,561,000 and $2,639,000,  respectively,  for each of the years
                in the three-year period ended April 1, 1995.

                Rental expense on two stores owned by two directors and/or their
                relatives  was $234,000 for each of the years in the  three-year
                period ended April 1, 1995.

         (b)    Legal Matters

                The Company has been party to a lawsuit  involving the Company's
                closing  of a store  which it had  leased  in  Charlotte,  North
                Carolina  and its refusal to pay rent with respect to such store
                from and after  February,  1991.  In  February  1995,  the Court
                entered  a  judgment  ordering  the  Company  to pay  the sum of
                $405,460  to  plaintiff.   The  Company  recorded  a  charge  to
                operations  for the year ended April 1, 1995 related to the loss
                on such litigation and paid such amount in March 1995.

         (c)    Employment Agreements

                As amended October 1, 1994, the Company entered into amended and
                restated employment  agreements with two officers,  which expire
                March  31,  2000  and  September  30,  1996,  respectively.  The
                aggregate annual average base compensation under such agreements
                is  approximately  $720,000  and  $242,000,   respectively.   In
                addition,  the two officers shall be credited,  as compensation,
                with the monthly  amounts  payable by them to the Company  under
                promissory notes (note 2). The Company also agreed to engage one
                of the officers as a consultant  during the period from the date
                immediately  following the period of employment  until September
                3, 2005, with an aggregate  average annual base  compensation of
                approximately $81,000.

                The respective  employment  agreements provide the officers with
                the use of an automobile,  full medical coverage,  reimbursement
                for life  insurance  policies,  paid  vacations and  substantial
                severance  pay to one of the officers if the Company  refuses to
                renew the employment agreement upon expiration,  or in the event
                of  termination  upon mutual  consent or  termination in certain
                other events.

(7)      Shareholders' Equity

         Authorized shares of common stock as of April 1, 1995 and April 2, 1994
         were 20,000,000 Class "A" and 10,000,000 Class "B" shares, both classes
         having a par value of $.01.  The two  classes of the  Company's  common
         stock are identical except that each class votes separately so that all
         matters requiring the vote of stockholders require the approval of both
         classes of common stock voting as separate classes.

         The  Company  had  agreed to sell to two  officers  shares of Class "A"
         common stock in 96 equal  consecutive  monthly  installments,  starting
         April 1, 1992, each installment  involving the purchase of an aggregate
         of 14,375 shares for $2,875 ($.20 per share).  The amounts  required to
         purchase  such shares were required to be credited as  compensation  to
         the two  officers.  Effective  October 1,  1994,  the  agreements  were
         terminated.


                                                                     (Continued)

(8)      Pension Plan

         Effective  September  15,  1994,  the  Company  decided to curtail  its
         noncontributory  defined  benefit plan which it had maintained with its
         Parent.  As a result of this  curtailment  all future benefit  accruals
         were eliminated and accrued benefits became fully vested.

         The  following  table sets  forth the plan's funded status at  April 1,

</TABLE>

         At April 1, 1995, the Company has a net operating loss carryforward for
         federal  income tax  purposes of $126,026  which is available to offset
         future federal taxable income, if any, through 2010.

         A valuation  allowance  is provided to reduce  deferred tax assets to a
         level which,  more likely than not, will be realized.  The net deferred
         assets  reflect  management's  estimate  of the  amount  which  will be
         realized  from  future   profitability  which  can  be  predicted  with
         reasonable certainty.

(10)     Sale of Land

         In May  1995,  the  Company  sold  an  unimproved  parcel  of  land  in
         Lafayette,  Louisiana.  As of April 1, 1995,  the net book value of the
         land approximated the sales price.

(11)     Store Closings

         During 1993, the Company  closed the Cutler Ridge,  Florida store which
         was  destroyed by Hurricane  Andrew and entered into an agreement  with
         the  landlord to terminate  the lease.  The costs  associated  with the
         closing are included in store closing costs for the year ended April 3,
         1993.

         During 1994, the Company closed the Aventura, Florida store and entered
         into an agreement to terminate the lease. The costs associated with the
         closing are included in store closing costs for the year ended April 2,
         1994.  As part of the  agreement  to terminate  the lease,  the Company
         executed a note to the former landlord in the amount of $75,000 payable
         in twelve monthly installments through March 1995.

         The  Company  recorded  a charge  relating  to four store  closings  of
         approximately  $595,500  for the year ended  April 1, 1995.  The charge
         includes the write-off of leasehold improvements,  loss incurred due to
         the  present  value  of  future  lease   obligations,   less  estimated
         sub-rental  income  and other  costs  incident  to the store  closings,
         offset by approximately $47,000 of deferred rent.

Employment Contracts

         On April  3,  1994,  when the 1995  fiscal  year  began,  Mr.  Wolk was
employed  by URT  under an  employment  agreement  dated as of March  31,  1992.
Effective  October 1,  1994,  URT and Mr.  Wolk  entered  into a new  employment
agreement which is presently in effect. Under his 1994 Agreement, as in his 1992
Agreement,  the period of employment  continues  until March 31, 2000.  The 1994
Agreement  reduced the annual rate of his base salary to $725,380 for the period
from October 1, 1994 though March 31,  1995,  to $575,380 for the next  eighteen
month period  ending  September  30, 1996 and to $784,048 for the balance of the
term of employment (as compared to an annual base salary at the rate of $834,048
under his 1992 Agreement). The 1994 Agreement eliminated provisions contained in
the 1992 Agreement under which Mr. Wolk was entitled to cost of living increases
based on increases in the consumer  price index and changes in U. S.  individual
income tax rates.  It reduced  certain  monthly credits to which he was entitled
under the 1992  Agreement  effective  October  1, 1994 from  $5,435 per month to
$2,935 per month but retained the provision  that if he died or became  disabled
during the term of such  agreement,  the  credits  which he would have  received
through March 31, 2000 (but in the reduced  amount under the 1994  Agreement) if
he had survived and not become  disabled  would be  accellerated  to the date of
death or  disability.  The 1994  Agreement  also  provided that URT would pay or
reimburse  him for the premiums on term or other life  insurance  coverage to be
selected by URT and payable to his designee in the amount of $2,600,000  for the
duration of his life (rather than being  reduced to  $1,500,000  after age 70 as
provided  in the 1992  Agreement).  Mr. Wolk was also  permitted  under the 1994
Agreement (as he had been under the 1992 Agreement) to repay certain loans which
are hereinafter


                                      -32-
<PAGE>


described in "Certain Relationships and Related Transactions"), over the term of
his employment.

         The  1994  Agreement  also  continued  to  provide  (as  had  the  1992
Agreement) that during his employment  period URT would furnish Mr. Wolk with an
automobile,  reimburse him for business  expenses,  including  socially  related
business  expenses  incurred by him,  and provide him with  hospital and medical
benefits; that upon termination of his employment, he would not compete with the
URT Companies for a period of three years and for the  additional  period during
which he accepted severance payments; that upon the termination of his period of
employment  and  URT's  refusal  to  continue  to  employ  him on  terms no less
favorable than those  contained in his  employment  agreement or in the event of
the earlier  termination of his employment for any reason other than death,  URT
was  required to pay him as  severance  payments,  an amount equal to his annual
base salary which was in effect at the time of termination and thereafter,  upon
each  anniversary of the  termination  date until his death,  50% of such annual
base salary (except for the elimination of provisions which had been in the 1992
Agreement  under  which he could have been  entitled  to  additional  amounts if
adjustments  were made due to increases in the consumer price index,  changes in
the income tax laws or certain other contingencies),  as reduced by any payments
he received under any pension or profit sharing plan of the URT Companies and if
applicable,  any disability insurance policy; that so long as he was entitled to
receive severance payments,  URT was required to continue to furnish him with an
automobile,  pay the premiums on the above described life insurance coverage and
provide medical  insurance  coverage for him and his family which would continue
during  his  lifetime  and that of his  wife,  if she  survived  him;  that as a
condition of receiving such severance payments and benefits,  he was required to
be  available  to the  URT  Companies  as a  consultant;  that  if any  persons,
excluding officers and directors of URT, should acquire effective control of URT
while he was in its employ, he would be entitled to receive,  in addition to all
other  payments  required to be made to him under his employment  agreement,  an
amount  equal to the maximum  amount  permitted  to be paid by URT without  such
payment being considered a "parachute  payment" under the Internal Revenue Code;
that such  provision was designed to deter  corporate  raiders and would require
that a  substantial  payment be made to him in the event  that any such  persons
acquired  effective  control  of URT.  The  amount  to which Mr.  Wolk  would be
entitled  under  the   circumstances   described   above  would  depend  on  his
compensation during the five tax years immediately  preceding any such change in
control.  If, for  illustrative  purposes,  such change in control had  occurred
during the 1995 tax year,


                                      -33-
<PAGE>


the payment to Mr. Wolk would have been approximately $2,900,000.

         The 1994 Agreement also permits Mr. Wolk to obtain a loan from URT on a
single  occasion  not to exceed  $400,000 for a period of up to five years at an
interest  rate of 3% per  annum,  which  is  required  to be  collateralized  by
adequate  security  and made  upon such  other  terms  and  conditions  as URT's
directors  with the advice of counsel deem  necessary to protect URT.  Under his
1992 Agreement, he was able to obtain a secured bridge loan repayable over three
years at prevailing  interest rates of up to $400,000 on a single occasion if he
should need it in connection with a change of personal residence.

         When the 1995 fiscal  year began,  Mr.  Jackowitz  was  employed by PEC
under an employment  agreement dated as of March 31, 1992.  Effective October 1,
1994, PEC and Mr.  Jackowitz  entered into a new employment  agreement  which is
presently in effect. Under his 1994 Agreement,  Mr. Jackowitz' employment period
will expire on September 30, 1996 instead of September 30, 2000,  the expiration
date of his 1992 Agreement  (although PEC has the right under the 1994 Agreement
to terminate his employment at any time after  September 30, 1995).  Thereafter,
he is required to act as a consultant  to the URT Companies  until  September 3,
2005 concerning company matters but is not required to spend more than ten hours
per month in doing so. Mr.  Jackowitz' 1994 Agreement reduced the annual rate of
his base salary to $258,833 for the period from  October 1, 1994  through  March
31, 1995,  and to $225,000  for the period from April 1, 1995 to  September  30,
1996 (while his employment continues) as compared to a base salary at the annual
rate of $309,490  together with cost of living  increases  based on increases in
the consumer price index and proportional  adjustments in compensation  based on
increases in U. S. individual  income tax rates,  which were provided for in the
1992 Agreement.  The 1994 Agreement also provided that Mr. Jackowitz is entitled
to a credit  as  additional  compensation  in the  amount  of $471 per month (as
opposed  to $846 per month  under the 1992  Agreement)  except (as had also been
provided under the 1992 Agreement) that if he died or became disabled during the
term of his  employment  agreement,  all such credits (in such  reduced  amount)
which he would have received if he had survived and not become disabled would be
accellerated to the date of death or disability. Such credits are required to be
paid both during his  employment  and  consulting  periods until the  promissory
notes against which they are to be applied have been paid in full.  Such credits
represent  monthly  amounts  which are payable by him under  certain  promissory
notes. The


                                      -34-
<PAGE>


credits under the 1992 Agreement had also been applied  against his  obligations
under a stock purchase agreement described below.

         Mr.  Jackowitz' 1994 Agreement  retained  provisions  which were in his
1992 Agreement  requiring PEC,  during his period of employment,  to furnish him
with an  automobile,  reimburse  him for business  expenses  including  socially
related  business  expenses  incurred by him, and provide him with  hospital and
medical benefits while he is employed by PEC.

         Mr.  Jackowitz'  1994  Agreement  also  provides  that during the first
twelve months of the consulting period, Mr. Jackowitz will be compensated at the
rate of $213,000 per annum and during each year of the balance of the consulting
period  at the  rate  of  $65,000  per  annum,  provided,  however,  that if the
consulting period should commence before October 1, 1996, other than as a result
of death,  voluntary  resignation or conviction of a crime  involving any act of
dishonesty which was intended to harm the URT Companies, his compensation during
the  consulting  period  would be at the rate of $225,000  per annum  during the
first year,  $125,000  during the second year,  and $65,000 per annum during the
balance of the  consulting  period.  If Mr.  Jackowitz  is unable to perform his
consulting services as a result of sickness,  accident or other cause outside of
his control,  PEC is still obligated under his 1994 Agreement to continue to pay
him the compensation required to be paid during the consulting period.

         The 1994 Agreement further provides that during the consulting  period,
PEC will use its best efforts to cause Mr. Jackowitz and his wife to be included
in PEC's  health  insurance  plan,  as in  effect  at the time of the end of his
employment  period and, in such event,  PEC will be required to pay for the cost
thereof  but not to exceed  $485 per  month;  but that if they are  unable to be
included,  PEC will be  responsible  for the cost incurred by Mr.  Jackowitz for
such purpose up to $485 per month; and that PEC will also pay him $500 per month
to pay for  the  costs  of any  automobile  which  is  used  by him  during  the
consulting period.

         In his  1992  Agreement,  PEC  was  required  to pay or  reimburse  Mr.
Jackowitz  for the  premiums  on term or other  life  insurance  coverage  to be
selected by PEC and payable to his  designee in the amount of  $1,000,000  if he
died  before age 70 and  $750,000  if he died  after age 70. The 1994  Agreement
provides that from and after January 1, 1995, PEC is no longer required to do so
but that on the first days of January  during 1995 through  2000, it will pay to
him as additional


                                      -35-
<PAGE>


compensation,  the amount of $10,000  per annum to enable him to obtain a policy
of life insurance on his life from any insurance company which he selects.

         The 1994 Agreement  also provides that during the consulting  period or
any period during which he is disabled,  as above described,  Mr. Jackowitz will
not own or operate or work for any  company  which owns or  operates  any retail
stores  which  sell  pre-recorded  audio  products  or divulge  any  information
relating to PEC's finances, leases, properties,  personnel or manner in which it
conducts business.

Compensation Committee Interlocks and Insider Participation

         URT does not have a  compensation  committee  or other board  committee
performing  equivalent  functions.  During the last  completed  fiscal year, all
deliberations   concerning   executive   officer   compensation   or  any  other
arrangements between URT and any executive officers were conducted by URT's full
board of directors,  provided,  however,  that no director voted on compensation
payable to him as an executive officer or any other arrangement  between him and
URT.

Pension Plan

         The URT Companies had adopted a defined  benefit pension plan and trust
(the "Pension  Plan")  effective April 1, 1985. Such Plan was amended during the
1995  fiscal  year to  provide  that no present  or future  employee  of the URT
Companies who was not a participant in the Pension Plan on September 9, 1994 was
eligible to become a participant  in the Pension Plan,  and that effective as of
September 14, 1994, no further  accrual of benefits would be made under the Plan
except to the extent,  if any, that such accruals were required by law. In March
of 1995,  the URT Companies  decided to terminate the Pension Plan effective May
12, 1995 and will file  documents  with the  Internal  Revenue  Service for such
purpose.  Upon receiving an appropriate  determination  letter from the Internal
Revenue  Service or the  expiration  of the period in which the Pension  Benefit
Guaranty Corporation can issue a notice of non-compliance,  whichever is sooner,
the assets of the Pension Plan will be distributed to Pension Plan participants.
Interests  in the Pension Plan have been  computed on the basis of  compensation
and service.

         As a result of the  termination  of the  Pension  Plan,  the  following
officers will be entitled, at age 65, to receive a


                                      -36-

single life annuity, payable monthly, in the following annual amounts:

Item 13. CERTAIN RELATIONSHIPS AND RELATED TRANSACTIONS

         As a result of their purchase in 1983 from an unaffiliated  third party
seller,  Allan Wolk and his brother,  Sheffield  Wolk, a former director of URT,
are the  owners  of the  land  and  building  on  which  the PEC  store  in Fort
Lauderdale,  Florida, is located.  Such property was and continues to be subject
to a lease with PEC as tenant,  which had been  negotiated  by the prior  owner.
During the 1995 fiscal year,  PEC made and paid for certain  renovations  to the
premises.  Based  on the  provisions  of the  lease,  the  owners  agreed  to be
responsible for $26,225 of such cost which, with interest,  is being deducted by
PEC over a period of 36 months.

         In September,  1984, PEC entered into a long term lease with the mother
of Allan Wolk,  Sheffield Wolk and Ann Krouse, of premises owned by her in North
Miami  Beach,  Florida  (the "North  Miami  Beach  lease").  It was  approved by
disinterested directors. As a result of her death, the premises are now owned by
Allan Wolk  (one-third  interest),  Ann  Krouse  (one-third  interest),  and two
children of Sheffield  Wolk,  each of whom has a one-sixth  interest.  The lease
term commenced on September 1, 1984 and is for a period of twenty years with two
additional five year terms. The lease is a triple net lease. The rental consists
of a net  minimum  rent  plus 5% of net  sales in  excess  of  $1,400,000  up to
$1,800,000 and 2-1/2% of net sales in excess of $1,800,000. The net minimum rent
during the first five years of the term was $95,000 per annum.  There are annual
increases in such minimum  rent,  before the  adjustments  described  below,  of
$10,000 during each of the next three five year periods and annual  increases of
$7,500 during each of the last two five year periods.

         In  October,  1990,  the North  Miami  Beach  lease was amended for the
purpose of including within the demised premises an adjoining parking area which
is also owned by the owners of the store site.  Such adjoining  parking area was
required  by  PEC  for  the  purpose  of  complying   with   applicable   zoning
requirements. As a result of the inclusion of such adjoining parking area in the
demised  premises  covered by the existing  lease,  PEC agreed to pay additional
annual net minimum rent


                                      -39-
<PAGE>


ranging from $9,000 in the first four years (commencing as of September 1, 1990)
to $14,000 in the final five years covered by the  amendment to such lease.  The
amendment was also approved by disinterested directors.

         In December,  1984, PEC entered into a long-term  lease with Allan Wolk
and Sheffield  Wolk for premises  owned by them in Orlando,  Florida.  The lease
term  commenced in December,  1984, and is for a period of twenty years with two
additional five year terms.  The lease is a triple net lease. The lease provides
for a net minimum rental rate of $125,000 per annum from the rental commencement
date through  March 31, 1985; a rate of $140,000 per annum during the  following
five year period; a rate of $145,000 per annum during the next five year period;
a rate of $160,000  during the next five year  period;  and  increases of $5,000
during  every  five  year  period  thereafter.  Notwithstanding  the  foregoing,
commencing  with the sixth  rental  year,  if net sales at the store  during any
rental year are less than  $1,800,000,  the annual net  minimum  rental rate for
such year will be the same as that which had been in effect during the preceding
five year period. The lease was approved by disinterested directors.

         Management  believes  that the  terms of such  North  Miami  Beach  and
Orlando  leases are as  reasonable  as those which could have been obtained from
unaffiliated third parties.

         In August,  1987,  URT made loans to Allan Wolk and David  Jackowitz of
$392,872 and $63,748,  respectively, and in March, 1988 made additional loans of
$123,000 and $21,000,  respectively.  The principal amounts of the August,  1987
loans were payable in five years,  with interest payable at the rate of 7.9% per
annum and the  principal  amounts of the March,  1988 loans were  payable in six
years,  with interest payable at the rate of 7.86% per annum. As  consideration,
in part, for the agreements of Mr. Wolk and Mr.  Jackowitz to reduce the amounts
of  compensation  which  would  have  been  payable  to  them  under  employment
agreements  dated as of  February  1,  1991,  which  were  then in  effect,  the
promissory notes evidencing the  above-described  indebtedness  were replaced by
new  promissory  notes which  permitted  such  indebtedness  to be repaid over a
period of eight years,  from April 1, 1992 through March 31, 2000, with interest
at the rate of 8.0% per annum, in 96 consecutive monthly  installments of $2,935
and  $471,  respectively.  The loans are  unsecured.  Under the  above-described
provisions of Mr. Wolk's 1994 Agreement  (which took effect on October 1, 1994),
he is entitled to be credited,  as  additional  compensation  through  March 31,
2000, when his agreement expires, at the rate of $2,935 per month. Under the


                                      -40-
<PAGE>


above described  provisions of Mr. Jackowitz' 1994 Agreement,  he is entitled to
be credited,  as additional  compensation,  at the rate of $471 per month during
the period of employment  and the consulting  period  provided for therein until
the amount owed has been paid. As a result of such  credits,  each of such loans
should be paid in full by March 31, 2000. See "Executive  Compensation".  During
the period from April 2, 1994  through  March 31,  1994,  Mr. Wolk was  credited
under his 1992 Agreement with a total of $22,650 and Mr.  Jackowitz was credited
with a total of $3,637 with respect to the above-described loans. As of June 15,
1995, the outstanding  principal amount of Mr. Wolk's loans was $140,813 and the
outstanding  principal amount of Mr.  Jackowitz' loans was $22,617.  The highest
amount  outstanding on Mr. Wolk's loans during the 1995 fiscal year was $167,416
and the highest amount  outstanding on Mr. Jackowitz' loans during such year was
$26,889.  Mr.  Wolk and Mr.  Jackowitz  used the funds lent to them to  purchase
shares of URT's Class A and Class B Common Stock from independent third parties.
The  disinterested  directors  authorized  URT  to  finance  such  purchases  as
above-described,  because they believed that such action would give Mr. Wolk and
Mr. Jackowitz continued incentive to remain with URT and to work to increase the
value of its shares.

         Pursuant  to stock  purchase  agreements  dated as of  February 1, 1989
which were entered  into by between URT and Mr. Wolk and URT and Mr.  Jackowitz,
Mr.  Wolk and Mr.  Jackowitz  each  agreed to purchase  from URT  2,000,000  and
300,000 shares,  respectively,  of URT's  authorized but unissued Class A common
stock in five  consecutive  equal  annual  installments  of  400,000  and 60,000
shares,  respectively,  commencing January 31, 1990. Prior to 1992, Mr. Wolk and
Mr. Jackowitz had acquired 800,000 and 120,000 shares, respectively, pursuant to
such stock purchase agreements.  As further consideration for their agreement to
reduce the amounts of  compensation  which would have been payable to them under
earlier employment  agreements,  the February 1, 1989 stock purchase  agreements
were amended as of March 31, 1992,  under which their obligation to purchase the
remaining 1,200,000 and 180,000 shares, respectively, was extended over a period
of eight years from April 1, 1992 through March 31, 2000. The purchase price for
such  shares was $0.20 per share,  payable by Mr. Wolk and Mr.  Jackowitz  in 96
consecutive monthly installments of $2,500 and $375, respectively.  Each of them
was entitled to receive the shares paid for.  Through  September  30, 1994,  Mr.
Wolk had  purchased an  aggregate of 1,175,000  shares for which he was credited
with an aggregate amount of $235,000 and Mr. Jackowitz had received an aggregate
of 176,250 shares for which he was credited with an aggregate amount of $35,250.
Pursuant to second  amendments to their  respective  stock purchase  agreements,
effective October 1, 1994, Mr. Wolk, Mr. Jackowitz


                                      -41-
<PAGE>


and URT agreed  that URT would have no further  obligation  to sell to either of
them any shares which had not been purchased  through  September 30, 1994,  that
each of them would  have no  obligation  to pay to URT any of the  consideration
which would have been  required  to have been paid under  their  stock  purchase
agreements, as originally amended, that neither of them had any further right to
purchase any of such unpurchased shares and that URT had no right to receive the
balance of the  consideration  which  would have been  payable by them under the
stock purchase agreements,  as originally amended. As a result of the foregoing,
no shares,  other than those above  described  which had been purchased  through
September  30, 1994 will be  purchased  by Mr. Wolk or Mr.  Jackowitz  under the
above described  agreements.  Under their respective stock purchase  agreements,
Mr. Wolk and Mr.  Jackowitz agreed that no share which was purchased may be sold
until the  expiration  of three years from the date of its  issuance.  The stock
purchase  agreements,  and the amendments under which the shares were authorized
to be issued to Mr. Wolk and Mr.  Jackowitz,  were approved by the disinterested
directors,  who found the agreements to be fair and reasonable  based on the bid
and asked prices quoted for Class A shares on the  over-the-counter  market, the
obligation  of Mr. Wolk and Mr.  Jackowitz to purchase the shares for the prices
specified in such agreements  regardless of what happened to the market price of
the shares and the fact that each share  acquired  could not be sold until three
years after the date of its  issuance.  The decision of URT and Mr. Wolk and Mr.
Jackowitz to terminate the share purchase arrangement  effective October 1, 1994
was approved by directors other than themselves.

         In April,  1989, URT's board of directors  authorized URT to enter into
agreements with its officers and directors under which they would be entitled to
be indemnified  by URT and have their expenses  advanced to them in the event of
any claim  against them in their  capacities  as officers and  directors.  On or
about May 22,  1989,  such  agreements  were entered into with all who were then
officers and directors of URT.

                                                                Exhibit 10(eeee)


                    AMENDED AND RESTATED EMPLOYMENT AGREEMENT
                    -----------------------------------------


         AGREEMENT  made  as of  the  1st  day  of  October,  1994  between  URT
INDUSTRIES,  INC., a corporation  duly  organized and existing under the laws of
the State of Florida (the "Company") whose principal offices are located at 3451
Executive Way, Miramar, Florida 33025, and ALLAN WOLK, whose business address is
3451 Executive Way, Miramar, Florida 33025 (the "Employee").

         The Employee is presently employed by the Company as its Chairman under
         an  employment  agreement  dated  as  of  March  31,  1992  (the  "1992
         Agreement");

         The  parties  have  agreed to reduce  the base  salary  payable  to the
         Employee and make various  additional changes to the 1992 Agreement and
         wish to set forth such changes herein.

         IT IS, THEREFORE AGREED,

         1. Subject to all of the terms and conditions of this Agreement (which,
from and  after  the date  hereof,  shall  replace  the  1992  Agreement  in its
entirety),  the  Company  agrees to  continue  to employ  the  Employee  and the
Employee  agrees to continue to be employed by the Company  from the date hereof
until  March 31,  2000 (the  "Period of  Employment").  Each year from April 1st
through March 31st during the Period of Employment  shall be hereinafter  called
an  "Employment  Year".  While so  employed,  the  Employee  shall  serve as the
Chairman of the Company's Board of Directors and as its Chief Executive


<PAGE>


Officer. The word "Company",  as used in paragraphs 2, 6, 7, 8, 9(e), 11, 12, 14
and 16 of this Agreement  shall include any company which is an affiliate of URT
Industries,  Inc.  at the time of or after  the  termination  of the  Employee's
employment, as the term "affiliate" is defined under the Securities Exchange Act
of 1934, as amended.

         2.   The Employee agrees that during the Period of Employment:

              (a) he shall  devote  his  entire  working  time and energy to the
business and affairs of the Company; and

              (b) he will not directly or indirectly be associated (as an owner,
partner, shareholder,  employee, officer, agent, consultant,  adviser, or in any
other capacity) with any person, firm,  corporation,  enterprise or entity other
than the Company.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, nothing contained herein shall
be construed to prevent the Employee  from:  (i) acting as a director of another
company  provided that there is no conflict of interest  between such activities
and the duties of the  Employee  under this  Agreement,  or (ii)  investing  his
assets in such form or manner as he may determine provided,  however,  that such
investments  shall not be made in any company  which  competes or transacts  any
material  amount of  business  with the  Company or involve  any  services to be
performed by the Employee.  The foregoing shall not in any event be construed to


                                      -2-


<PAGE>


prevent the Company from leasing any real  property in which the Employee has an
interest provided that all requirements of fiduciary duty are satisfied.

         3. From and after the date of this Agreement,  the Company shall pay to
the Employee,  monthly,  on the first day of each month,  for services  rendered
hereunder, a base salary ("base salary"), at the following annual rates:

              (i) for that portion of the current Employment Year,  beginning on
October  1, 1994 and  ending  on March 31,  1995,  at the  annual  rate of Seven
Hundred Twenty Five Thousand Three Hundred and Eighty Dollars ($725,380.00);

              (ii) for the next  Employment  Year beginning on April 1, 1995 and
ending on March 31,  1996,  at the  annual  rate of Five  Hundred  Seventy  Five
Thousand Three Hundred Eighty Dollars ($575,380.00);

              (iii) for the portion of the next  Employment  Year  beginning  on
April 1, 1996 and ending on  September  30,  1996,  at the  annual  rate of Five
Hundred Seventy Five Thousand Three Hundred Eighty Dollars ($575,380.00);

              (iv) for the following  twelve (12) calendar  months  beginning on
October 1, 1996 and ending on September  30,  1997,  at the annual rate of Seven
Hundred Eighty Four Thousand Forty Eight Dollars ($784,048.00);

              (v) for the following twelve (12)


                                      -3-


<PAGE>


calendar  months  beginning on October 1, 1997 and ending on September 30, 1998,
at the annual rate of Seven  Hundred  Eighty Four  Thousand  Forty Eight Dollars
($784,048.00);

              (vi) for the following  twelve (12) calendar  months  beginning on
October 1, 1998 and ending on September  30,  1999,  at the annual rate of Seven
Hundred Eighty Four Thousand Forty Eight Dollars ($784,048.00); and

              (vii) for the  following  six (6)  calendar  months  beginning  on
October  1, 1999 and  ending  on March 31,  2000,  at the  annual  rate of Seven
Hundred Eighty Four Thousand Forty Eight Dollars ($784,048.00);

         4. In addition to the payments of base salary,  the Company will credit
the Employee, as additional  compensation,  with the amount of Two Thousand Nine
Hundred Thirty Five Dollars ($2,935.00) per month on the first day of each month
during the Period of  Employment.  If the  Employee  owes the  Company  any such
amount at such time, the amount credited shall be applied by the Company against
the amount  owed.  If such amount is not owed to the Company at such time,  such
amount will be paid to the Employee on each of such dates.

         5. In the event of the death or total disability of the Employee before
the expiration of the Period of Employment,


                                      -4-


<PAGE>


the Company  will credit the  Employee,  as  additional  compensation,  with the
aggregate of all  remaining  amounts  which it would have  credited to him under
paragraph 4 during the balance of the Period of Employment. If the Employee owes
any money to the Company at such time,  the amounts so credited shall be applied
by the Company  against the amounts  owed.  If there is any excess,  it shall be
paid to the Employee's estate.

         6. The  Employee  agrees  that he  shall be  required  to  perform  the
services required hereunder at any office of the Company which is located during
the Period of Employment in Dade or Broward Counties,  Florida. In no event will
the Company  require him to permanently  relocate to a different area during the
Period of Employment without his approval.

         7. The  Employee  shall  be  entitled  to such  paid  vacations  as the
Employee may deem to be appropriate  during the Period of Employment,  provided,
however,  that such  vacations  do not  prevent him from  performing  his duties
hereunder and do not violate any requirements  with respect thereto which may be
established by the Board of Directors from time to time.

         8. The  Employee  acknowledges  that he is the senior  executive of the
Company,  that his  duties  have  involved  him in very  significant  and highly
confidential matters on behalf of


                                      -5-


<PAGE>


the Company and that he possesses  intimate  knowledge  concerning the Company's
business,  finances and operations. Both he and the Company agree that if, after
the expiration or termination of his employment,  he should engage,  directly or
indirectly,   in  any  enterprise   which  is  competitive  with  the  Company's
activities, such competition could severely injure the Company. Accordingly, the
parties have, after thorough discussion, agreed on provisions which they believe
are fair in that they protect the Company from such  competition  while,  at the
same time, adequately compensate the Employee. Such provisions are as follows:

              (a)  During  the  period   commencing   with  such  expiration  or
termination and continuing for three (3) years thereafter and for the additional
period described in subparagraph  9(a) or 9(b) during which the Employee accepts
the payments  described  therein,  the  Employee  agrees that he will not own or
operate or work for or in connection with any company which owns or operates any
retail store which sells recorded audio or video  products,  including tapes and
compact disks, or blank audio or video tapes, or any other material product line
which  the  Company  sells  during  the  Period  of  Employment  in any state or
territory of the United States. The restrictions  contained in this subparagraph
shall apply to the Employee acting by himself or through any other person,  firm
or entity of any kind, on his own behalf as well as on behalf of


                                      -6-


<PAGE>


any other person, firm or company, either directly or indirectly.

              (b) In addition to the foregoing,  the Employee  agrees that for a
period of three (3) years after the date of such  expiration or termination  and
for the  additional  period  described  in  subparagraph  9(a) during  which the
Employee  accepts the  payments  described  therein,  he will not divulge to any
other  person,  firm or  company,  any  information  relating  to the  Company's
finances, leases, properties,  personnel or manner in which the Company conducts
its business.

         9. (a) In the event of the  expiration  of this  Agreement  or  earlier
termination of this Agreement for any reason other than death including, without
limitation,  total  disability  and mutual  consent of the parties,  the Company
agrees to pay to the Employee,  as severance payments:  (i) upon such expiration
or  termination  (the  "termination  date"),  an amount equal to the  Employee's
annual base salary which was in effect at the time of the termination  date; and
(ii) upon  each  anniversary  of the  termination  date,  until the death of the
Employee,  fifty (50%)  percent of the amount  described  in  subparagraph  (i),
payable  quarterly.  All  severance  payments  required  to be made  under  this
subparagraph in the event of the Employee's total disability shall be subject to
the provisions of subparagraph 9(c).


                                      -7-


<PAGE>


              (b) During the period  described in subparagraph  9(a) and so long
as  Employee  is  entitled to receive  payments  thereunder,  the Company  shall
continue to provide:  (i) medical  insurance  coverage  for the Employee and his
family at least equal to that which was  provided at the time of the  expiration
or  termination  of  this   Agreement;   (ii)  an  automobile  to  the  Employee
substantially  equivalent  to  that  which  was  provided  at the  time  of such
expiration or termination; and (iii) the payments described in paragraph 15.

              (c) In the event of the Employee's total disability,  all payments
received by the Employee under the disability  income insurance policy presently
provided by the Company shall be credited  against the first amounts  payable to
the Employee under  subparagraph  9(a). Such payments shall be made quarterly on
the  first  day of each  month  during  the first  twelve  (12)  months of total
disability and monthly  thereafter.  Appropriate  adjustments  shall be made for
portions of any year and, at the end of each year,  there shall be an adjustment
with  respect  to any  above-described  credits  which  were not used to  offset
payments made under this  paragraph.  The Company  agrees to pay all premiums on
said policy during the Period of Employment.  The term "total  disability" shall
have the same meaning in this  Agreement  as in said  insurance  policy.  In the
event of the termination of this Agreement as a result of total disability,  the
provisions of paragraph 8 shall apply with full


                                      -8-


<PAGE>


force and effect.

              (d) All payments  received by the Employee  under this paragraph 9
shall constitute the  consideration  for the rights granted to the Company under
paragraph 8 hereof as well as severance pay.

              (e) As a condition of receiving the severance  payments  described
herein and as a condition of receiving  the benefits  described in  subparagraph
(b), from and after the date of the  expiration or termination of this Agreement
as  above  provided,  the  Employee  shall be  available  to the  Company,  as a
consultant,  to furnish  advice to the Company  relating to its  operations  and
business  including,  without  limitation of the  generality  of the  foregoing,
matters involving the opening of new stores, the sale of new products,  employee
relations and the acquisition of other  companies.  Such  consultation  shall be
required to take place at the home of the Employee,  wherever located, unless at
the Employee's  option,  he should desire such consultation to take place at the
offices of the  Company.  In no event shall the Employee be required to spend an
aggregate of more than ten (10) hours per month (which shall not be  cumulative)
in carrying out his responsibilities under this subparagraph.

              (f) Upon the death of the Employee and if his wife  survives  him,
the Company shall continue to provide medical insurance coverage to her, for the
duration of her


                                      -9-


<PAGE>


life,  which is at least  equal to that  which was  provided  at the time of the
death of the Employee.

              (g) For as long as any payments or benefits may be due to Employee
under this paragraph 9, the Company shall not sell all or  substantially  all of
its assets, merge with another company or engage in a reorganization of any kind
or nature, in one or a series of transactions, except upon the written agreement
by any such other  entity,  as  applicable,  which  written  agreement  shall be
delivered to Employee,  to assume all of the  Company's  obligations  under this
Agreement.

         10. If, during the Period of  Employment,  any person,  firm or company
(excluding  officers and  directors of the Company)  acting  individually  or in
concert so that they are  required to file a Form 13-D with the  Securities  and
Exchange  Commission,  should  acquire  effective  control of the  Company  and,
therefore, the ability to cause a board of directors chosen by such person, firm
or company to be elected,  in addition to all other payments required to be made
to the Employee under this Agreement,  the Employee shall be entitled to receive
an amount  equal to the  maximum  amount  which  may be paid by the  Corporation
without  such payment  being  considered a  "parachute  payment"  under  Section
280G(b)(2)(A)  of the Internal  Revenue Code of 1986 ("Code") as the same may be
amended during the Period of Employment.


                                      -10-


<PAGE>


         11. The Employee acknowledges that because of the Company's multi-state
business,  its desire to continue to expand such  business  geographically,  the
significance  of the  Employee  to the  Company's  business  and  the  severance
benefits  provided  for,  the time and  geographical  restrictions  contained in
paragraph 8 are fair and reasonable.

         12. The  Employee  agrees and  acknowledges  that if he fails to comply
with the provisions of subparagraphs  8(a) and (b), such failure would result in
irreparable  and  continuing  damage to the  Company for which there would be no
adequate remedy at law and that the Company, in such event, shall be entitled to
injunctive  relief  and to  such  other  and  further  remedies  as it may  deem
necessary  in order to cause  him to  comply  with his  obligations  under  such
paragraphs.  If the Company  seeks such  relief as the result of the  Employee's
alleged failure to comply with such paragraphs and the Company is successful, in
whole or in part,  in obtaining  the relief  sought,  the Employee  agrees to be
responsible  for the  payment of all legal  fees and  expenses  incurred  by the
Company in connection with its efforts to remedy such failure to comply.  If the
Company is not successful,  either in whole or in part, the Company agrees to be
responsible  for the  payment of all legal  fees and  expenses  incurred  by the
Employee in defense of the  Company's  efforts to remedy the alleged  failure to
comply. No waiver or purported waiver by the Employee of any severance


                                      -11-


<PAGE>


benefits  shall be construed to release or limit the  obligations  undertaken by
the Employee under subparagraphs 8(a) or (b).

         13.  The  Company  acknowledges  that  the  Employee  will  require  an
automobile in connection  with the normal  performance  of his duties under this
Agreement  and agrees to provide him with an  automobile of his selection and to
pay the costs and expenses of the operation of such automobile.

         14. During the Period of  Employment,  the Company  agrees to supply to
the Employee such hospital and medical  insurance  benefits and similar benefits
as the Company provides to other executive employees.

         15.  During  the  Period of  Employment  and the  period  described  in
subparagraph  9(b),  the Company will cause a policy of insurance on the life of
the Employee to be maintained which will provide  insurance  proceeds to be paid
to persons who are designated either by the Employee or by persons who, with the
Employee's  consent,  have purchased such policy or caused it to be issued.  The
policy shall  provide for proceeds of Two Million Six Hundred  Thousand  Dollars
($2,600,000)  to be payable  upon the death of the  Employee.  The Company  will
either pay or reimburse  the Employee for the  insurance  premiums  payable with
respect to such insurance. Subject to the Employee's approval, which will not be
withheld unreasonably, the Company shall have


                                      -12-


<PAGE>


the right to determine the type of insurance policy which shall be purchased and
the company from whom such policy is obtained.  At present there are a term life
insurance  policy and a whole life insurance  policy on the life of the Employee
which provide for such  aggregate  amount of insurance  proceeds in the event of
the death of the Employee.  The Company  shall  continue to be  responsible  for
payment of the premiums on said policies until and unless they are replaced with
other policies as above provided. The above provisions shall apply regardless of
whether  such  policies  are owned by the  Employee,  his wife,  a member of his
family or a trust  established  for the  benefit of  members  of the  Employee's
family.

         16.  If, on a single  occasion  during  the  Period of  Employment  the
Employee  should  desire to obtain a loan from the  Company  in an amount not to
exceed Four Hundred  Thousand Dollars  ($400,000.00)  for a period not to exceed
five (5) years,  the Company  agrees to furnish such loan to the Employee,  upon
the following conditions:

              (a) the Employee shall pay interest to the Company monthly on such
loan at the rate of 3% per annum (such rate being,  in part,  the  consideration
for the  agreement of the Employee to reduce his base salary and change the 1992
Agreement in certain other respects, as provided in this Agreement);

              (b) the Employee shall be required to provide adequate security to
the Company for repayment of the loan; and


                                      -13-


<PAGE>


              (c) such loan shall be upon such other terms and conditions as the
directors  of the  Company,  with the advice of counsel,  deem to be required to
protect the Company.

         17.  The  Employee  is  authorized  to incur  reasonable  expenses  for
promoting  the business of the Company,  including  expenses for  entertainment,
travel and similar  items.  The Company will reimburse the Employee for all such
expenses upon the  presentation by the Employee,  from time to time, of itemized
accounts of such expenditures.

         18. This Agreement shall not be altered, amended or supplemented except
by an instrument or  instruments  in writing  signed by both the Company and the
Employee and no rights  contained herein may be waived or abridged except by the
execution of such written instrument by both parties.

         19. The provisions of this Agreement  shall inure to the benefit of and
be binding upon the Company and its  respective  successors and assigns and upon
the heirs, legal representatives and assigns of the Employee.

         20. Any notices or  communications  between the parties given hereunder
shall be in writing and sent by certified or registered  mail,  postage prepaid,
as follows: If to the Employee, addressed to him at his address above


                                      -14-

written.  If to the Company,  addressed to its address above written,  attention
Mr. David Jackowitz;  or to such other address or addresses as either party may,
from time to time, designate in writing to the other.

         21. If for any reason any provision of this Agreement shall be found to
be void or invalid,  such provision shall be construed in a manner so as to give
it maximum  effect and such finding shall not effect the validity of the rest of
the  Agreement,  which  shall  remain in force as if  executed  with the void or
invalid provision eliminated.

         22. This Agreement  supersedes any and all prior agreements between the
Company and Employee with respect to the subject matter hereof.

         IN WITNESS WHEREOF, the parties have hereunto set their hands and seals
the day and year first above written.

                    AMENDED AND RESTATED EMPLOYMENT AGREEMENT
                    -----------------------------------------

         AGREEMENT  made  this  14  day  of  December,   1994  between   PEACHES
ENTERTAINMENT  CORPORATION,  a corporation duly organized and existing under the
laws of the State of Florida (the "Company") whose principal offices are located
at 3451  Executive  Way,  Miramar,  Florida 33025,  and DAVID  JACKOWITZ,  whose
address is 7045 Golf Pointe Circle, Tamarac, Florida 33321 (the "Employee").

         The  Employee is  presently  employed  by the Company as its  Executive
         Vice-President  and Treasurer  under an agreement  dated March 31, 1992
         (the "1992 Agreement");

         The  parties  wish to  modify  the  provisions  of the 1992  Agreement,
         effective  as of October 1, 1994 (the  "Effective  Date"),  and restate
         herein  all of the  terms  and  conditions  which  shall  apply  to the
         employment of the Employee from and after the Effective Date.

         IT IS, THEREFORE, AGREED,

         1. Subject to all of the terms and  conditions of this  Agreement,  the
Company  agrees to continue to employ the Employee  and the  Employee  agrees to
continue to be employed by the Company from the Effective  Date until  September
30,  1996  unless  sooner   terminated  as  provided   herein  (the  "Period  of
Employment").  While so  employed,  the  Employee  shall serve as the  Executive
Vice-President and Treasurer of the Company and as


<PAGE>


President and Treasurer of URT Industries,  Inc. ("URT"), an affiliated company,
at the  pleasure of the  respective  boards of directors of the Company and such
affiliate,  and perform such duties as the board of directors of the Company may
determine.  The word "Company", as used in paragraphs 2, 3, 6, 7, 8, 12, 13, 15,
16,  17, 21 and 22 of this  Agreement  shall  include  any  company  which is an
affiliate of the Company at the time of or after the  termination  of the Period
of Employment,  as the term "affiliate" is defined under the Securities Exchange
Act of 1934, as amended.

         2. Subject to all of the terms and  conditions of this  Agreement,  the
Company  also agrees to engage the  Employee as a  consultant  during the period
from the date immediatley  following the termination of the Period of Employment
until September 3, 2005, the date when the Employee  reaches age 65, such period
hereinafter  called the "Consulting  Period".  During the Consulting Period, the
Employee agrees to consult with the executive  officers of the Company  relating
to its operations and business  including,  without limitation of the generality
of the foregoing,  matters involving the opening of new stores,  the sale of new
products,  employee  relations  and the  acquisition  of other  companies.  Such
services are hereinafter called "Consulting  Services".  The Consulting Services
shall be required to be performed at the home of the Employee, wherever located,
unless at the Employer's option, he should desire to perform them at


                                      -2-


<PAGE>


the offices of the Company.  In no event shall the Employee be required to spend
an  aggregate  of more  than  ten (10)  hours  per  month  (which  shall  not be
cumulative) in performing the Consulting Services.

         3.   During the Period of Employment, the Employee shall:

              (a) devote his entire  working time and energy to the business and
affairs of the Company; and

              (b) not,  directly  or  indirectly,  be  associated  (as an owner,
partner, shareholder,  employee, officer, agent, consultant,  adviser, or in any
other capacity) with any person, firm,  corporation,  enterprise or entity other
than the Company.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, nothing contained herein shall
be construed to prevent the Employee,  during such Period, from: (i) acting as a
director  of another  company  provided  that there is no  conflict  of interest
between such activities and the duties of the Employee under this Agreement,  or
(ii)  investing his assets in such form or manner as he may determine  provided,
however,  that such investments  shall not be made in any company which competes
or  transacts  any material  amount of business  with the Company or involve any
services to be performed by the Employee.  The foregoing  shall not in any event
be construed to prevent the Company from leasing any real  property in which the
Employee has an interest if such lease is approved by directors  who do not have
an interest in such real property.


                                      -3-

         4. For the  services  performed  by the  Employee  during the Period of
Employment, the Company shall pay to the Employee,  monthly, on the first day of
each month, the following amounts of base salary ("base salary"):

              (a) for the period  commencing on the Effective Date and ending on
March 31, 1995,  at the rate of Two Hundred Fifty Eight  Thousand  Eight Hundred
Thirty Three Dollars ($258,833) per annum; and

              (b) for the  period  commencing  on April 1,  1995 and  ending  on
September 30, 1996, at the rate of Two Hundred Twenty-Five Thousand Five Hundred
Dollars ($225,500) per annum.

         5. (a) As of September  30, 1994,  the Employee  owed URT the amount of
Twenty Five Thousand One Hundred Seven Dollars ($25,107) under a promissory note
dated  March 31,  1992.  In  addition  to the above  described  payments of base
salary, so long as any indebtedness  remains unpaid on such note, there shall be
credited against the amounts owed under such note, as additional compensation to
the Employee,  both during the Period of Employment and the  Consulting  Period,
the amount of Four Hundred Seventy One Dollars ($471) per month on the first day
of each  month.  No such  amount  shall be  credited  or paid  after  such  note
indebtedness has been paid in full.

              (b) In the  event of the death or total disability of the Employee
during either the Period of Employment or the  


                                      -4-


<PAGE>


Consulting  Period and if any  amounts  are then owed on such note,  the Company
will credit the Employee with such additional  compensation,  as shall equal the
aggregate amount which is then owed under such note.

         6. The  Employee  agrees  that he  shall be  required  to  perform  the
services  required to be performed during the Period of Employment at any office
of the Company which is then located in Dade or Broward Counties, Florida. In no
event will the Company  require him to permanently  relocate to a different area
during the Period of Employemnt without his approval.

         7. During the Period of Employment, the Employee shall be entitled to a
paid  vacation  at the rate of four (4) weeks  during each period of twelve (12)
months  commencing  on the  Effective  Date through the balance of the Period of
Employment. All such vacations shall be taken at such times as both the Employee
and the Company may deem to be  appropriate  taking into  account the  Company's
needs from time to time.

         8. The Employee acknowledges that he is one of the senior executives of
the Company,  that his duties have involved him in very  significant  and highly
confidential  matters on behalf of the  Company and that he  possesses  intimate
knowledge concerning the Company's business, finances and operations.


                                      -5-


<PAGE>


Both he and the Company agree that if, after the  expiration or  termination  of
the Period of  Employment,  he should  engage,  directly or  indirectly,  in any
enterprise which is competitive with the Company's activities,  such competition
could severely injure the Company. Accordingly, the parties have, after thorough
discussion,  agreed  on  provisions  which  they  believe  are fair in that they
protect the Company from such  competition  while, at the same time,  adequately
compensate the Employee. Such provisions are as follows:

              (a) During the Consulting  Period or Disability Period (as defined
in  subparagraph  11(a))  during  which he is  entitled to  disability  benefits
hereunder, the Employee agrees that he will not own or operate or work for or in
connection  with any company which owns or operates any retail store which sells
pre-recorded audio products,  including musical tapes and musical compact disks.
The  restrictions  contained  in this  subparagraph  shall apply to the Employee
acting by himself or through any other  person,  firm or entity of any kind,  on
his own behalf as well as on behalf of any other person, firm or company, either
directly or indirectly.

              (b) In addition to the foregoing,  the Employee agrees that during
the Consulting and Disability  Periods, he will not divulge to any other person,
firm or company,  any information  relating to the Company's  finances,  leases,
properties, personnel or manner in which the Company conducts its business.


                                      -6-


<PAGE>


         9.  During the  Consulting  Period,  the  Company  agrees to pay to the
Employee,  monthly  on the  first day of each  month,  as  compensation  for his
services as a consultant:

              (a) If the Consulting Period commences on October 1, 1996:

                   (i) during each of the first twelve (12)  calendar  months of
the Consulting  Period,  at the rate of Two Hundred  Thirteen  Thousand  Dollars
($213,000) per annum; and

                   (ii) during each month  thereafter  until the Employee  shall
reach the age of  sixty-five  (65)  years,  at the rate of Sixty  Five  Thousand
Dollars ($65,000) per annum.

              (b) If the Consulting Period commences before October 1, 1996, for
any reason other than death, voluntary resignation, or the Employee's conviction
of a crime  involving  any act of  dishonesty  which  is  intended  to harm  the
Company:

                   (i) during each of the first twelve (12)  calendar  months of
the Consulting  Period at the rate of Two Hundred  Twenty Five Thousand  Dollars
($225,000) per annum;

                   (ii) during each of the next twelve (12)  calendar  months of
the Consulting  Period at the rate of One Hundred  Twenty Five Thousand  Dollars
($125,000) per annum; and

                   (iii) during each month  thereafter  until the Employee shall
reach  the age of sixty  five (65)  years,  at the rate of Sixty  Five  Thousand
Dollars ($65,000) per annum.

              (c) The inability of the Employee to perform


                                      -7-


<PAGE>


the Consulting  Services during the Consulting Period, in whole or in part, as a
result of sickness,  accident or other cause outside of the Employee's  control,
shall  not  affect  the  obligation  of the  Company  to pay  the  Employee  the
compensation  which it is  required  to pay to him under  subparagraphs  9(a) or
9(b).

         10. (a) During the  Consulting  Period,  the Company  shall also do the
following:

                   (i) use its best  efforts to continue  to cause the  Employee
and his wife to be included  under the Company's  health  insurance  plan, as in
effect at the time of the end of the  Period  of  Employment,  and,  if they are
included,  the Company shall be  responsible  solely for the costs thereof which
are  allocable  to the  Employee  and his wife which do not exceed Four  Hundred
Eighty Five Dollars ($485) per month,  with the Employee being  responsible  for
all amounts  exceeding Four Hundred Eighty Five Dollars ($485) per month. If the
Company advises the Employee that despite using its best efforts to do so, it is
not able to  continue to cause the  Employee  and his wife to be included in the
Company's  health  insurance  plan,  and if the  Employee  believes  that  it is
possible to enable them to be included by  following a specific  procedure,  the
Employee  shall  advise the Company of such  procedure  which the Company  shall
communicate to the provider of such health insurance


                                      -8-


<PAGE>


coverage. If the latter agrees that such procedure may be utilized,  the Company
shall follow such procedure to attempt to enable the Employee and his wife to be
included in the Company's health insurance plan provided, however, that under no
circumstances,  shall the Company be responsible for any costs thereof in excess
of Four Hundred Eighty Five Dollars ($485) per month. However, if the Company is
not able to cause the  Employee  and his wife to be included  in such plan,  the
Employee  shall be  responsible  for  obtaining  health  insurance  coverage for
himself and his wife in which event the Company will reimburse him, from time to
time but no more frequently than monthly,  with such portion of the cost thereof
which does not exceed Four Hundred Eighty Five Dollars ($485) per month; and

                   (ii) pay to the  Employee  Five  Hundred  Dollars  ($500) per
month on the first day of each  month to assist  him to pay for the costs of any
automobile which is used by him during the Consulting Period; and

                   (iii)   continue  to  make  those   payments   described   in
subparagraph  20(b) which are  required  to be made during the period  described
therein.

             (b) All  payments  under  subparagraph  10(a) shall be deemed to be
additional compensation to the Employee.


         11. (a) In the event of the Employee's total


                                      -9-


<PAGE>


disability  during the Period or  Employment,  the  Period of  Employment  shall
terminate in which event the Employee  shall be required to perform on behalf of
the Company the same services as the  Consulting  Services  until he attains the
age of sixty five (65) but only to the extent that he is physically and mentally
able to do so. The term "total  disability"  shall have the same meaning in this
Agreement  as in the  disability  income  insurance  policy  which is  presently
maintained by the Company (the "Disability  Policy"). In the event of such total
disability,  he shall be entitled  to receive all amounts  which would have been
payable  under  subparagraphs  9(a)  or  9(b) as if the  Consulting  Period  had
commenced  on the date of his total  disability.  All  payments to the  Employee
under this paragraph shall constitute taxable compensation to the Employee.  The
period  during which he shall be entitled to receive such amounts is referred to
herein as the "Disability  Period". All payments received by the Employee during
the Disability  Period under the  Disability  Policy as in effect at the time of
total  disability,  shall be credited  against the first amounts  payable to the
Employee under this paragraph.  All payments  required to be made by the Company
to the Employed under this  paragraph,  shall be made quarterly on the first day
of each month  during the first  twelve  (12) months of  disability  and monthly
thereafter.  Appropriate adjustments shall be made for portions of any year and,
at the end of each  year,  there  shall be an  adjustment  with  respect  to any
permitted credits described


                                      -10-


<PAGE>


above  which were not used to offset  payments  made under this  paragraph.  The
Company agrees to pay all premiums on the Disability Policy during the Period of
Employment.

              (b) In addition to the foregoing, during the Disability Period the
Company will also make the same  payments to or for the Employee and provide the
same  benefits to the Employee as it would have been required to pay and provide
during the  Consulting  Period if the  Employee  had not been  disabled  and the
Period of Employment had terminated on the date of total disability. All amounts
paid under this  subparagraph  shall be deemed to be additional  compensation to
the Employee.

         12. All payments received by the Employee under paragraphs 9, 10 and 11
shall also constitute  consideration for the rights granted to the Company under
paragraph 8.

         13. As a condition of receiving all payments required to be made during
the Consulting Period and as a condition of receiving all amounts payable during
the Disability  Period,  if any, the Employee  shall be required to execute,  in
such form as the Company's attorneys shall approve:

              (a) a general release in favor of the Company


                                      -11-


<PAGE>


and its  affiliates,  officers  and  directors,  under which he  unconditionally
releases each of them from and against all  liabilities  and  obligations  which
they may have to him, without limitation, reserving, however, those rights which
are contained in this Agreement; and

              (b) an  agreement  indemnifying  each of them from and against all
costs and expenses,  including  reasonable legal fees and disbursements,  in the
event of the  assertion  by the  Employee  of any  claim to which  such  general
release applies.

         14. The Employee shall have the right to cause the Consulting  Services
to be performed by any entity,  corporation  or  partnership  of which he is the
controlling  shareholder  or  partner  and to assign to it all of his  rights to
receive  the  compensation  for  such  Services  during  the  Consulting  Period
provided,  however,  that he,  alone,  shall be  required  to perform all of the
Consulting Services.

         15. For as long as any  payments  or  benefits  may be due to  Employee
under this Agreement, the Company shall not sell all or substantially all of its
assets,  merge with another company or engage in a reorganization of any kind or
nature, in one or a series of transactions, except upon the written agreement by
any such other  entity,  as  applicable,  a copy of which shall be  delivered to
Employee, to assume all of the


                                      -12-


<PAGE>


Company's obligations under this Agreement.

         16. The Employee acknowledges that because of the Company's multi-state
business,  its desire to continue to expand such  business  geographically,  the
significance  of the  Employee  to the  Company's  business  and  the  severance
benefits  provided  for,  the time and  geographical  restrictions  contained in
paragraph 8 are fair and reasonable.

         17. The  Employee  agrees and  acknowledges  that if he fails to comply
with the provisions of subparagraphs  8(a) and (b), such failure would result in
irreparable  and  continuing  damage to the  Company for which there would be no
adequate remedy at law and that the Company, in such event, shall be entitled to
injunctive  relief  and to  such  other  and  further  remedies  as it may  deem
necessary  in order to cause  him to  comply  with his  obligations  under  such
paragraphs.  If the Company  seeks such  relief as the result of the  Employee's
alleged failure to comply with such paragraphs and the Company is successful, in
whole or in part,  in obtaining  the relief  sought,  the Employee  agrees to be
responsible  for the  payment of all legal  fees and  expenses  incurred  by the
Company in connection with its efforts to remedy such failure to comply.  If the
Company is not successful,  either in whole or in part, the Company agrees to be
responsible for the payment of all


                                      -13-


<PAGE>


legal fees and  expenses  incurred by the  Employee in defense of the  Company's
efforts to remedy the alleged failure to comply.  No waiver or purported  waiver
by the  Employee of any  benefits  under this  Agreement  shall be  construed to
release or limit the obligations  undertaken by the Employee under subparagraphs
8(a) or (b).

         18.  The  Company  acknowledges  that  the  Employee  will  require  an
automobile  during  the  Period of  Employment  in  connection  with the  normal
performance of his duties under this  Agreement and agrees,  during such Period,
to provide  him with an  automobile  of his  selection  and to pay the costs and
expenses of the operation of such automobile.

         19. During the Period of  Employment,  the Company  agrees to supply to
the Employee such hospital and medical  insurance  benefits and similar benefits
as the Company provides to other executive employees.

         20.  (a)  During  the  period  commencing  on the  Effective  Date  and
continuing  through  December 31, 1994,  the Company will cause a policy of life
insurance  on the life of the  Employee  to be  maintained  which  will  provide
insurance  proceeds  to be paid to  persons  who are  designated  either  by the
Employee or by persons described in the last sentence of this


                                      -14-


<PAGE>


paragraph who, with the Employee's consent, have purchased such policy or caused
it to be issued.  The policy shall  provide for proceeds of One Million  Dollars
($1,000,000)  to be payable upon the death of the Employee if the Employee shall
die prior to the age of seventy  (70)  years and in the amount of Seven  Hundred
Fifty  Thousand  Dollars  ($750,000) if the Employee  shall die after the age of
seventy (70) years.  The Company  will either pay or reimburse  the Employee for
the insurance  premiums  payable with respect to such insurance.  Subject to the
Employee's approval, which will not be withheld unreasonably,  the Company shall
have the  right  to  determine  the  type of  insurance  policy  which  shall be
purchased and the company from whom such policy is obtained. As of the Effective
Date there were term life  insurance  policies on the life of the Employee which
provided for such  aggregate  amount of  insurance  proceeds in the event of the
death of the  Employee.  During the above  described  period,  the Company shall
continue to be  responsible  for payment of the premiums on said policies  until
and unless they are replaced with other  policies as above  provided.  The above
provisions  shall apply  regardless  of whether  such  policies are owned by the
Employee,  his wife,  a member  of his  family  or a trust  established  for the
benefit of members of the Employee's family.

               (b) After  December  31,  1994,  the  Company  shall no longer be
required to pay any premiums on the  existing  policies of insurance on the life
of the Employee. On the 1st


                                      -15-


<PAGE>


days of January,  1995, 1996, 1997, 1998, 1999 and 2000, the Company will pay to
the Employee,  as additional  compensation,  the amount of Ten Thousand  Dollars
($10,000) per annum to enable the Employee to obtain a policy of life  insurance
on his life from any  insurer,  in such  amounts and  containing  such terms and
conditions as the Employee shall determine.

         21. During the Period of  Employment,  the Employee shall be authorized
to  incur  reasonable  expenses  for  promoting  the  business  of the  Company,
including expenses for entertainment, travel and similar items. The Company will
reimburse  the  Employee  for all such  expenses  upon the  presentation  by the
Employee,  from time to time, of itemized accounts of such expenditures.  At his
request,  the Company will also advance to him, from time to time, amounts which
are  approved by it and  reasonably  required  by him to perform the  Consulting
Services.

         22.  Notwithstanding  anything heretofore  contained in this Agreement,
the Company shall be entitled to terminate the Employee's  employment hereunder,
without cause, on September 30, 1995 or at any time thereafter  provided that it
has first given at least thirty (30) days  advance  notice to the  Employee.  In
such event, the Employee, if requested by the Company,  shall continue to render
his services and be paid his


                                      -16-


<PAGE>


regular  compensation  up to the  time of  termination.  Without  limitation  of
anything  heretofore  contained,  it is  understood  that  in  such  event,  all
provisions of this Agreement which are applicable to the Consulting  Period will
then take effect.

         23. This Agreement shall not be altered, amended or supplemented except
by an instrument or  instruments  in writing  signed by both the Company and the
Employee and no rights  contained herein may be waived or abridged except by the
execution of such written instrument by both parties.

         24. The provisions of this Agreement  shall inure to the benefit of and
be binding upon the Company and its  respective  successors and assigns and upon
the heirs, legal representatives and assigns of the Employee.

         25. Any notices or  communications  between the parties given hereunder
shall be in writing and sent by certified or registered  mail,  postage prepaid,
as follows:  If to the Employee,  addressed to him at his address above written.
If to the Company, addressed to its address above written, attention Allan Wolk;
or to such other  address or addresses  as either party may,  from time to time,
designate in writing to the other.


                                      -17-


<PAGE>


         26. If for any reason any provision of this Agreement shall be found to
be void or invalid,  such provision shall be construed in a manner so as to give
it maximum  effect and such finding shall not effect the validity of the rest of
the  Agreement,  which  shall  remain in force as if  executed  with the void or
invalid provision eliminated.

         27. This Agreement  supersedes any and all prior agreements between the
Company and Employee with respect to the subject matter hereof.

         28. URT does not guarantee  performance of and is not  responsible  for
any of the obligations undertaken by the Company to the Employee hereunder.

         29. This  Agreement  shall be governed by and  construed in  accordance
with the laws of the State of Florida. Any action or proceeding which is brought
by  either  party to  enforce  this  Agreement  shall be  brought  in a court of
appropriate  jurisdiction  located in Broward County,  Florida.  If either party
commences any such action or proceeding for such purpose, the party who prevails
after a final judgment has been entered, which is no longer appealable, shall be
responsible for the payment of the costs and expenses which are


                                      -18-


<PAGE>


incurred in such  litigation  by the  non-prevailing  party  including,  without
limitation, appellate costs and reasonable attorneys' fees.

         IN WITNESS WHEREOF, the parties have hereunto set their hands and seals
the day and year first above written.

                               SECOND AMENDMENT TO
                            STOCK PURCHASE AGREEMENT
                            ------------------------

         AGREEMENT made this 14th day of December,  1994 between URT INDUSTRIES,
INC., a corporation  duly  organized and existing under the laws of the State of
Florida (the "Company"),  whose principal  offices are located at 3451 Executive
Way,  Miramar,  Florida 33025, and DAVID  JACKOWITZ,  whose address is 7045 Golf
Pointe Circle, Tamarac, Florida 33321 ("Jackowitz").

         On February 1, 1989,  the Company and  Jackowitz  entered  into a stock
         purchase  agreement  (the  "Stock  Purchase   Agreement")  under  which
         Jackowitz  agreed to purchase  an  aggregate  of 300,000  shares of the
         Company's  Class A common  stock  for an  aggregate  purchase  price of
         $60,000  at a rate  of  60,000  shares  per  year on the  first  day of
         February of each year from 1990 through 1994.

         In 1990 and 1991, Jackowitz purchased an aggregate of 120,000 shares of
         such stock for a total  consideration of $24,000,  leaving a balance of

         installment  date,  Jackowitz would pay the Company $375 for the shares
         purchased.

         Amendment (the "Amended Stock  Purchase  Agreement"),  between April 1,
         1992 and September 1, 1994,  Jackowitz purchased an aggregate of 56,250
         shares of the Company's Class A common stock for which

         123,750 shares of such stock remaining  unpurchased  (the  "Unpurchased
         Shares") under the Amended Stock Purchase Agreement.


         The Company and Jackowitz have agreed that on and after October 1, 1994
         (the  "Effective  Date"),  the Company  shall not sell to Jackowitz and
         Jackowitz  shall not  purchase  from the Company any further  shares of
         stock under the Amended Stock Purchase  Agreement and wish to set forth
         such agreement herein.

         IT IS, THEREFORE, AGREED THAT:

Purchase  Agreement  shall be terminated and have no further force or effect and
all of the provisions of this Agreement shall apply.

         2. As a  result  of such  termination  of the  Amended  Stock  Purchase

              (a) from and after the Effective  Date,  the Company shall have no
obligation  to sell to Jackowitz  any of the  Unpurchased  Shares and  Jackowitz
shall have no obligation to pay to the Company any of the consideration therefor
which is provided for in the Amended Stock Purchase Agreement; and

              (b)  Jackowitz  shall  have  no  right  to  purchase  any  of  the
Unpurchased  Shares and the Company  shall have no right to receive from him the

documents and take such other and further  action as either party may request at
any time for the purpose of further evidencing that all of the obligations under
