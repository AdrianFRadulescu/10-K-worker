                                     PART I

Item 1.       Business.

Formation

WestMed Venture  Partners,  L.P. (the  "Partnership"  or the  "Registrant") is a
Delaware  limited  partnership  organized  in February  1987.  In May 1987,  the
Partnership  elected  to operate as a  business  development  company  under the
Investment  Company Act of 1940, as amended (the "1940 Act"). The  Partnership's
investment  objective  is to achieve  long-term  capital  appreciation  from its
portfolio of venture capital investments, consisting of companies engaged in the
health-care industry.  The Partnership considers this activity to constitute the
single industry segment of venture capital investing.

The  general  partners  of the  Partnership  consist of three  individuals  (the
"Independent General Partners") and WestMed Venture Management, L.P., a Delaware
limited  partnership (the "Managing  General  Partner"),  the general partner of
which is Medical Venture Holdings,  Inc. ("MVH"), a Delaware  corporation and an
affiliate of Oppenheimer & Co., Inc. ("Opco").

In 1987, the Partnership  publicly offered 100,000 units of limited  partnership
interest (the  "Units") at $500 per Unit.  The Units were  registered  under the
Securities Act of 1933,  pursuant to a Registration  Statement on Form N-2 (File
No.  33-11926),  which was declared  effective on July 2, 1987. The  Partnership
held its initial  closing on  September  1, 1987 and  completed  the offering on
April 1, 1988, at which time it had accepted subscriptions for a total of 66,929
Units.  Gross capital  contributions to the Partnership from the public offering
total $33,802,529; $33,464,500 from the limited partners (the "Limited Partners"
and collectively with the Managing General Partner, the "Partners") and $338,029
from the Managing General Partner.

The Venture Capital Investments

From its inception through December 31, 1995, the Partnership had invested $28.4
million in 23  portfolio  companies  (including  venture  capital fees and other
acquisition   costs   totaling  $1.9   million).   At  December  31,  1995,  the
Partnership's  investment  portfolio  consisted of  investments in 13 companies.
Such  investments  had an  aggregate  cost of $11.7  million and a fair value of
$13.7 million. From its inception through December 31, 1995, the Partnership had
liquidated  10  portfolio  investments  with  a cost  of  $16.7  million.  These
liquidated investments returned $7 million to the Partnership for a net realized
loss of $9.7 million. At December 31, 1995, the Partnership had a cumulative net
loss from its venture  capital  investments  totaling  $9.2  million,  including
$492,000 of interest and other income from portfolio  investments.  During 1995,
the Partnership  invested $292,000 in two existing  portfolio  companies.  These
investments  and other events  affecting the  Partnership's  portfolio  security
holdings during 1995 are listed below.

During March 1995, Cortex Pharmaceuticals,  Inc. effected a one-for-five reverse
split of its outstanding  common stock. As a result,  the Partnership  exchanged
its 704,167  shares of common  stock and warrants to purchase  32,500  shares of
Cortex  common  stock at $1.84 per share for 140,833  shares of common stock and
warrants  to  purchase  6,500  shares of common  stock at $9.19  per  share.  In
December 1995, such warrants expired unexercised.

In June 1995, the Partnership made a follow-on  investment  totaling $238,635 in
UroCor,  Inc.,  acquiring  45,000  shares of  preferred  stock and a warrant  to
purchase 9,000 shares of common stock at $5.00 per share. The Partnership paid a
$13,635 venture capital fee relating to this investment.

In May 1995, the  Partnership's  warrant to purchase 15,446 shares of Aprogenex,
Inc.  common stock was increased to 16,458 and the exercise price was reduced to
$7.39 as a result of an  anti-dilutive  provision in the warrant  agreement.  In
July and August 1995,  the  Partnership  sold 51,000 shares of  Aprogenex,  Inc.
common stock for $276,000, realizing a gain of $65,000.

On July 31, 1995, the Partnership's warrants to purchase 46,535 shares of common
stock of Ultramed, Inc. expired unexercised.

In  October  1995,  HBO  &  Company,   a  public  company,   acquired   CliniCom
Incorporated.   The   Partnership   exchanged   its  4,908  shares  of  CliniCom
Incorporated for 1,963 shares of HBO & Company.

In  November  1995,  the  Partnership  made a $53,030  follow-on  investment  in
Exocell,  Inc.,  including  $3,030 of venture  capital fees paid to the Managing
General Partner, to acquire a $50,000 non-interest-bearing  convertible note due
March 31, 1997.

During 1995, the Partnership  received a $55,593 cash  distribution  from Nimbus
Medical, L.P. and reversed $2,351 of interest income recorded in 1994.

Competition

The  Partnership  encounters  competition  from other  entities  having  similar
investment  objectives.  Primary competition for venture capital investments has
been from venture  capital  partnerships,  venture  capital  affiliates of large
industrial  and financial  companies,  small business  investment  companies and
wealthy  individuals.  Competition has also been from foreign investors and from
large industrial and financial  companies investing directly rather than through
venture  capital  affiliates.  The Partnership has frequently been a co-investor
with other professional  venture capital investors and these  relationships have
expanded the Partnership's access to investment opportunities.

Employees

The  Partnership  has no  employees.  The Managing  General  Partner,  under the
supervision  of the  Independent  General  Partners,  manages and  controls  the
Partnership's   venture  capital  investments.   The  Managing  General  Partner
performs,  or arranges for others to perform,  the management and administrative
services  necessary for the operation of the  Partnership and is responsible for
managing the Partnership's short-term investments.

Item 2.       Properties.

The Partnership does not own or lease physical properties.

Item 3.       Legal Proceedings.

The Partnership is not a party to any material pending legal proceedings.

Item 4.       Submission of Matters to a Vote of Security Holders.

No matter was submitted to a vote of security  holders during the fourth quarter
of the fiscal year covered by this report.

                                     PART II

Item 5.   Market for Registrant's Common Equity and Related Stockholder Matters.

There is no  established  public  trading  market  for the  Units  and it is not
anticipated  that a public  market  for the Units  will  develop.  The number of
individual holders of Units at December 31, 1995 was approximately 6,500.

There were no cash distributions to Partners during the years ended December 31,
1995, 1994 or 1993.  Cumulative cash distributions to Partners from inception to
December 31, 1995, total $5.7 million; $5.65 million to the Limited Partners, or
approximately $85 per Unit, and $57,000 to the Managing General Partner.

Pursuant to the Partnership's agreement of limited partnership,  as amended (the
"Partnership  Agreement"),  the  Partnership's net income and net realized gains
from all sources are allocated to all  Partners,  in proportion to their capital
contributions,  until all Partners have been allocated an amount equal to 6% per
annum, simple interest, on their total Adjusted Invested Capital; i.e., original
capital contributions reduced by previous distributions (the "Priority Return").
Thereafter,  net income and net realized gains from venture capital  investments
in excess of the amount used to cover the Priority  Return are  allocated 20% to
the  Managing  General  Partner and 80% to all Partners in  proportion  to their
capital  contributions.  Any net income from non-venture  capital investments in
excess of the  amount  used to cover the  Priority  Return is  allocated  to all
Partners in  proportion  to their  capital  contributions.  Realized  losses are
allocated to all Partners in proportion to their capital contributions. However,
if realized gains had been previously  allocated in the 80-20 ratio, then losses
are allocated in the reverse order in which profits were allocated.

Item 7. Management's  Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results
        of Operations.

Liquidity and Capital Resources

During the year ended  December  31, 1995,  the  Partnership  invested  $292,000
(including  venture  capital fees  totaling  $17,000) in two existing  portfolio
companies.  At December 31, 1995, the  Partnership  had invested an aggregate of
$28.4 million in 23 portfolio companies (including acquisition costs and venture
capital fees totaling $1.9 million).  The Partnership has invested approximately
95% of its original $30 million of net  proceeds  received  from the offering of
Units.

At December 31, 1995, the  Partnership  held $2.3 million in cash and short-term
investments as follows: $1.8 million in short-term securities with maturities of
less than three months and $512,000 in an interest-bearing cash account. For the
years ended December 31, 1995,  1994 and 1993, the  Partnership  earned interest
from such investments  totaling  $129,000,  $105,000 and $96,000,  respectively.
Interest  earned from  short-term  investments  in future  periods is subject to
fluctuations  in short-term  interest  rates and changes in funds  available for
investment.  It is  anticipated  that  funds  needed to cover the  Partnership's
future  follow-on  investments  and  operating  expenses  will be obtained  from
existing cash reserves, interest earned from the short-term investment portfolio
and proceeds from the sale of portfolio investments.

Results of Operations

For the years ended December 31, 1995,  1994 and 1993, the Partnership had a net
realized  loss from  operations  of  $309,000,  $3.2  million and $4.6  million,
respectively.  Net realized gain or loss from operations is comprised of (i) net
realized  gains or losses from  portfolio  investments  and (ii) net  investment
income or loss (interest and dividends less operating expenses).

Realized  Gains and  Losses  from  Portfolio  Investments  - For the year  ended
December 31,  1995,  the  Partnership  had a net  realized  gain from  portfolio
investments  of  $65,000  resulting  from the sale of  51,000  common  shares of
Aprogenex, Inc. in the public market for $276,000.

For the year ended December 31, 1994, the Partnership had a net realized loss of
$2.8 million from its portfolio  investments.  During March and April 1994,  the
Partnership  sold 20,000  common shares of CliniCom  Incorporated  in the public
market for $422,000, realizing a loss of $944,000.  Additionally at December 31,
1994, the Partnership wrote-off $166,000 of cost relating to its remaining 4,908
shares of common stock of CliniCom due to the continued  depressed public market
price of such shares.  Also, in December  1994,  the  Partnership  wrote-off its
$323,000  investment in Vaso Products Inc.,  $576,000 of its $826,000 investment
in Bellara Medical Products Inc. and $801,000 of its $1.3 million  investment in
Ultramed,  Inc. due to continued  business and financial  difficulties  at these
companies.

For the year ended December 31, 1993, the Partnership had a $4 million  realized
loss from  portfolio  investments.  In March 1993, the  Partnership  sold 40,000
common shares of Somatogen, Inc. in the public market for $440,000,  realizing a
gain  of  $319,000.   On  December  31,  1993,  the  Partnership  wrote-off  its
investments  in  LMA,   Ltd.,   Oncodiagnostics,   Inc.  and  Advanced   Medical
Technologies totaling $4.3 million due to business and financial difficulties at
these companies.


<PAGE>


Investment  Income  and  Expenses  - Net  investment  loss for the  years  ended
December  31,  1995,  1994  and  1993  was  $375,000,   $421,000  and  $540,000,
respectively.  The  decrease in net  investment  loss for 1995  compared to 1994
primarily is attributable to the $41,000 increase in investment income for 1995.
This  increase   reflects  a  $24,000   increase  in  interest  from  short-term
investments for 1995 compared to 1994, due to higher  short-term  interest rates
during the 1995 period.  Additionally,  accrued portfolio interest of $2,400 and
$19,000 was reversed in 1995 and 1994, respectively,  resulting in an additional
$17,000  increase in  investment  income for 1995  compared  to 1994.  Operating
expenses  remained  relatively  flat,  decreasing only $5,000 from 1995 to 1994.
Management  fees and  professional  fees  decreased by $76,000 while general and
administrative  and other expenses increased by $71,000 for the 1995 period. The
increase in general and  administrative  expense  resulted  from  directors  and
officers liability insurance coverage initiated in August 1994.

The  decrease in net  investment  loss for the 1994 period  compared to the 1993
period is attributable to a decrease in operating  expenses for the 1994 period,
primarily professional fees and general and administrative  expenses.  Operating
expenses   declined  $118,000  from  $625,000  in  1993  to  $507,000  in  1994.
Professional  fees  declined  $71,000 and general  and  administrative  expenses
declined  $29,000 for the 1994 period compared to the 1993 period due to certain
cost control  measures  implemented by the Managing  General  Partner during the
fourth quarter of 1993.

Pursuant to a  management  agreement  between the  Partnership  and the Managing
General Partner, the Managing General Partner is responsible for the management,
administrative  and  certain  investment  advisory  services  necessary  for the
operation of the  Partnership.  For such services,  the Managing General Partner
receives  a  management  fee at the  annual  rate of 2% of the lesser of the net
assets of the  Partnership or the net  contributed  capital of the  Partnership;
i.e., gross capital contributions to the Partnership (net of selling commissions
and  organizational  expenses)  reduced  by  capital  distributed.  Such  fee is
determined and payable  quarterly.  For the years ended December 31, 1995,  1994
and 1993, the management fee was $268,000, $361,000 and $379,000,  respectively.
The decrease in the management fee for each year is a result of a decline in the
Partnership's net assets for the respective  years. To the extent possible,  the
management  fee and other  operating  expenses are paid with funds provided from
operations.  Funds provided from operations are obtained from interest  received
from  short-term  investments,  interest  and  dividend  income  from  portfolio
investments and proceeds received from the sale of portfolio investments.

Unrealized   Gains  and  Losses  and  Changes  in  Unrealized   Appreciation  or
Depreciation  of Portfolio  Investments - For the year ended  December 31, 1995,
the  Partnership  had a  $1.6  million  unrealized  gain  from  the  net  upward
revaluation of its publicly-held  portfolio  investments,  primarily  Somatogen,
Inc. and Corvita Corporation.

For the year ended  December 31, 1994,  the  Partnership  had a $3.5 million net
unrealized loss from its portfolio investments, primarily resulting from the net
downward revaluation of its publicly-held  portfolio  investments.  Additionally
during 1994, $2.9 million was transferred  from unrealized loss to realized loss
relating to the write-off of certain portfolio investments,  as discussed above.
The $3.5 million  unrealized loss partially  offset by the $2.9 million transfer
from  unrealized  loss to realized loss  resulted in a $618,000  decrease to net
unrealized appreciation of investments for 1994.



<PAGE>


For the year ended  December  31,  1993,  the  Partnership  had a  $276,000  net
unrealized  loss from its portfolio  investments,  primarily  related to the net
downward revaluation of its publicly-held  portfolio  investments.  Additionally
during 1993, the Partnership transferred a net $3.9 million from unrealized loss
to realized  loss  related to the sale and the  write-off  of certain  portfolio
investments,  as discussed  above.  The $3.9 million  transfer to realized  loss
partially  offset by the additional  $276,000 net unrealized  loss resulted in a
$3.6 million increase to net unrealized appreciation of investments for 1993.

Net Assets - Changes to net assets resulting from operations is comprised of (i)
net realized gains and losses from operations and (ii) changes to net unrealized
appreciation or depreciation of portfolio investments.

At December 31, 1995 the Partnership's net assets were $15.8 million, reflecting
an increase  of $1.3  million  from $14.5  million at December  31,  1994.  This
increase resulted from the $1.6 million increase in net unrealized  appreciation
of  investments  offset by the $309,000 net realized  loss from  operations  for
1995.

At  December  31,  1994,  the  Partnership's  net  assets  were  $14.5  million,
reflecting a decrease of $3.9  million from $18.4  million at December 31, 1993.
This decrease  resulted from the $3.2 million net realized loss from  operations
and the $618,000  decrease in net unrealized  appreciation  of  investments  for
1994.

At  December  31,  1993,  the  Partnership's  net  assets  were  $18.4  million,
reflecting  a decrease of $1 million  from $19.4  million at December  31, 1992.
This decrease  resulted from the $4.6 million net realized loss from  operations
partially offset by the $3.6 million increase in net unrealized  appreciation of
investments for 1993.

At  December  31,  1995,  1994 and  1993,  the net asset  value  per $500  Unit,
including an  allocation  of net  unrealized  appreciation  or  depreciation  of
investments,  was $235, $215 and $272,  respectively.  Such per Unit amounts are
based on average allocations to all Limited Partners and do not reflect specific
Limited Partner  allocations,  which are determined by the original closing date
associated with the Units held by each Limited Partner.

INDEPENDENT AUDITORS' REPORT



WestMed Venture Partners, L.P.:

We have audited the  accompanying  balance sheets of WestMed  Venture  Partners,
L.P. (the "Partnership"),  including the schedules of portfolio investments,  as
of December 31, 1995 and 1994, and the related  statements of  operations,  cash
flows,  and  changes in  partners'  capital  for each of the three  years in the
period  ended   December  31,  1995.   These   financial   statements   are  the
responsibility of the Partnership's management. Our responsibility is to express
an opinion on these financial statements based on our audits.

We  conducted  our  audits  in  accordance  with  generally   accepted  auditing
standards.  Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material
misstatement.  An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting
the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our procedures included
confirmation of securities owned at December 31, 1995 and 1994 by correspondence
with the custodian;  where  confirmation  was not possible,  we performed  other
audit  procedures.  An audit also includes  assessing the accounting  principles
used and  significant  estimates made by  management,  as well as evaluating the
overall financial statement  presentation.  We believe that our audits provide a
reasonable basis for our opinion.

In our  opinion,  such  financial  statements  present  fairly,  in all material
respects,  the financial position of WestMed Venture Partners,  L.P. at December
31,  1995 and 1994,  and the results of its  operations,  its cash flows and the
changes in its partners' capital for each of the three years in the period ended
December 31, 1995 in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles.

As explained in Note 2, the financial  statements  include  securities valued at
$11,079,422  and  $11,953,915  at  December  31,  1995 and  1994,  respectively,
representing  70% and 82% of net assets,  respectively,  whose  values have been
estimated   by  the  Managing   General   Partner  in  the  absence  of  readily
ascertainable  market  values.  We  have  reviewed  the  procedures  used by the
Managing General Partner in arriving at its estimate of value of such securities
and have  inspected  underlying  documentation,  and, in the  circumstances,  we
believe  the  procedures  are  reasonable  and  the  documentation  appropriate.
However,  because of the inherent  uncertainty  of  valuation,  those  estimated
values may differ  significantly from the values that would have been used had a
ready market for the securities existed, and the differences could be material.

on February 5, 1987. The Partnership  operates as a business development company

the health care industry.  The Partnership is scheduled to terminate on December

appropriate   discount   include   underwriter   lock-up  or  Rule  144  trading
restrictions,  insider status where the Partnership  either has a representative
serving on the board of directors of the portfolio  company under  consideration
or is greater than a 5% shareholder thereof, and other liquidity factors such as
the  size of the  Partnership's  position  in a given  company  compared  to the
trading history of the public security.  Privately-held portfolio securities are
carried at cost until significant  developments  affecting the portfolio company
provide a basis for change in valuation. The fair value of private securities is
adjusted  (i) to reflect  meaningful  third-party  transactions  in the  private
market and (ii) to reflect  significant  progress or slippage in the development
of the  company's  business such that cost no longer  reflects fair value.  As a
venture capital investment fund, the Partnership's portfolio investments involve
a high  degree of business  and  financial  risk that can result in  substantial
losses.  The Managing  General  Partner  considers such risks in determining the
fair value of the Partnership's portfolio investments.

Use of Estimates - The  preparation of financial  statements in conformity  with
generally accepted  accounting  principles requires management to make estimates
and assumptions  that affect the reported  amounts of assets and liabilities and
disclosure of  contingent  assets and  liabilities  at the date of the financial
statements  and the  reported  amounts  of  revenues  and  expenses  during  the
reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates.

Investment  Transactions - Investment  transactions  are recorded on the accrual
method. For portfolio  investments,  transactions are recorded on the date which
the Partnership obtains an enforceable right to demand the securities or payment
thereof.  Realized  gains  and  losses on  investments  sold are  computed  on a
specific identification basis.

Statements  of  Cash  Flows  - Cash  and  cash  equivalents  include  short-term
interest-bearing   investments  in  commercial  paper  and  other  money  market
investments.  The Partnership  considers its interest-bearing cash account to be
cash equivalents.

Income Taxes - No provision  for income taxes has been made since all income and
losses are  allocable  to the partners for  inclusion  in their  respective  tax
returns.  The Partnership's net assets for financial  reporting  purposes differ
from its net assets for tax purposes. Net unrealized  appreciation of $2 million
at December 31, 1995, which was recorded for financial statement  purposes,  was
not  recognized for tax purposes.  Additionally,  from inception to December 31,
1995, other timing differences  totaling $7.9 million,  relating to net realized
losses,  original sales  commissions  paid and other costs of selling the Units,
have been recorded on the  Partnership's  financial  statements but have not yet
been deducted for tax purposes.

3.     Allocations of Partnership Profits and Losses

Pursuant to the Partnership's agreement of limited partnership (the "Partnership
Agreement"),  the  Partnership's  net  income  and net  realized  gains from all
sources  are  allocated  to  all  Partners,   in  proportion  to  their  capital
contributions,  until all Partners have been allocated an amount equal to 6% per
annum, simple interest, on their total Adjusted Invested Capital; i.e., original
capital contributions reduced by previous distributions (the "Priority Return").
Thereafter,  net income and net realized gains from venture capital  investments
in excess of the amount used to cover the Priority  Return are  allocated 20% to
the  Managing  General  Partner and 80% to all Partners in  proportion  to their
capital  contributions.  Any net income from non-venture  capital investments in
excess of the  amount  used to cover the  Priority  Return is  allocated  to all
Partners in  proportion  to their  capital  contributions.  Realized  losses are
allocated to all Partners in proportion to their capital contributions. However,
if realized gains had been previously  allocated in the 80-20 ratio, then losses
are  allocated in the reverse order in which  profits were  allocated.  From its
inception to December 31, 1995, the Partnership had a $9.2 million net loss from
its venture capital investments  including  cumulative interest and other income
from portfolio investments totaling $492,000.

4.     Related Party Transactions

Pursuant to the Partnership Agreement,  the Managing General Partner is entitled
to receive a one-time venture capital fee equal to 5% of the gross proceeds from
the sale of Units. Such fee is incurred as portfolio investments are made in the
proportion of the cost of each portfolio investment to the net proceeds from the
sale of Units. Venture capital fees incurred are recorded as a cost of acquiring
the portfolio investments. For the years ended December 31, 1995, 1994 and 1993,
the Partnership  incurred venture capital fees of $17,000,  $40,000 and $10,000,
respectively.  Cumulative  venture  capital  fees  incurred  from  inception  to
December 31, 1995 totaled $1.6 million.

Pursuant to a  management  agreement  between the  Partnership  and the Managing
General Partner, the Managing General Partner is responsible for the management,
administrative  and  certain  investment  advisory  services  necessary  for the
operation of the  Partnership.  For such services,  the Managing General Partner
receives  a  management  fee at the  annual  rate of 2% of the lesser of the net
assets of the  Partnership or the net  contributed  capital of the  Partnership;
i.e., gross capital contributions to the Partnership (net of selling commissions
and  organizational  expenses)  reduced  by  capital  distributed.  Such  fee is
determined and payable quarterly.

For services rendered to the Partnership,  each of the three Independent General
Partners  receives a $5,000 annual fee and  reimbursement  for all out-of-pocket
expenses relating to attendance at meetings of the General Partners.

individuals  who are not  "interested  persons" of the Partnership as defined in

exemptive  order  declaring  that  Messrs.   Elliott,   Taylor  and  White,  the
Independent General Partners of the Partnership, are not "interested persons" of
