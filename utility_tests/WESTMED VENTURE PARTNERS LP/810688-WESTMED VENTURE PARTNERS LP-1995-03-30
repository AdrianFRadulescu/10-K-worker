Item 1.       Business.

Formation

WestMed Venture  Partners,  L.P.,  formerly known as Integrated  Medical Venture
Partners,  L.P. (the "Partnership" or the  "Registrant"),  is a Delaware limited
partnership  organized in February 1987. In May 1987, the Partnership elected to
operate as a business  development  company under the Investment  Company Act of
1940, as amended (the "1940 Act"). The Partnership's  investment objective is to
achieve  long-term  capital  appreciation  from its portfolio of venture capital
investments,  consisting of companies engaged in the health-care  industry.  The
Partnership considers this activity to constitute the single industry segment of
venture capital investing.

The  general  partners  of the  Partnership  consist of three  individuals  (the
"Independent General Partners") and WestMed Venture Management, L.P., a Delaware
limited  partnership (the "Managing  General  Partner"),  the general partner of
which is Medical Venture Holdings,  Inc. ("MVH"), a Delaware  corporation and an
affiliate of Oppenheimer & Co., Inc. ("Opco").

In 1987, the Partnership  publicly offered 100,000 units of limited  partnership
interest (the  "Units") at $500 per Unit.  The Units were  registered  under the
Securities Act of 1933,  pursuant to a Registration  Statement on Form N-2 (File
No.  33-11926),  which was declared  effective on July 2, 1987. The  Partnership
held its initial  closing on  September  1, 1987 and  completed  the offering on
April 1, 1988, at which time it had accepted subscriptions for a total of 66,929
Units.  Gross capital  contributions to the Partnership from the public offering
total $33,802,529; $33,464,500 from the limited partners (the "Limited Partners"
and collectively with the Managing General Partner, the "Partners") and $338,029
from the Managing General Partner.

The Venture Capital Investments

From its inception through December 31, 1994, the Partnership had invested $28.1
million in 23  portfolio  companies  (including  venture  capital fees and other
acquisition   costs   totaling  $1.9   million).   At  December  31,  1994,  the
Partnership's  investment  portfolio  consisted of  investments in 13 companies.
Such  investments had an aggregate cost of $11.7 million and a fair value of $12
million.  From its inception  through  December 31, 1994,  the  Partnership  had
liquidated  10  portfolio  investments  with a cost  of  $16.45  million.  These
liquidated  investments  returned  $6.69  million to the  Partnership  for a net
realized loss of $9.76 million.  During 1994, the Partnership  invested $693,000
in  two  existing  portfolio  companies.  These  investments  and  other  events
affecting the Partnership's portfolio investments during 1994 are listed below.

In March and April 1994, the  Partnership  sold 20,000 shares of common stock of
CliniCom Incorporated  ("CliniCom") for $422,000,  realizing a loss of $944,000.
Additionally,  at December 31, 1994, the Partnership  wrote-off $166,000 of cost
on its remaining 4,908 shares of common stock of CliniCom.

In March 1994, Cortex  Pharmaceuticals,  Inc. ("Cortex") extended the expiration
date of the  Partnership's  warrant to purchase 32,500 shares of Cortex's common
stock from April 30, 1994 to April 30, 1995.

<PAGE>


On March 30, 1994, the  Partnership  purchased  58,000 shares of preferred stock
and a warrant to purchase 8,995 common shares of CytoDiagnostics,  Inc. ("Cyto")
for $249,400.  In connection with this financing,  the Partnership converted its
$71,738  promissory  note of Cyto and  accrued  interest  of $2,579  into 17,283
preferred  shares.  The  Partnership  paid a $15,270  venture capital fee to the
Managing  General  Partner  relating to this  investment.  In October 1994, Cyto
changed its name to UroCor, Inc.

In May and September  1994, the  Partnership  purchased 10% promissory  notes of
Corvita  Corporation  ("Corvita")  totaling $201,392.  Such notes were repaid in
October 1994 with interest.  In June 1994,  Corvita  effected a 3-for-4  reverse
split of its common stock. In October 1994, Corvita completed its initial public
offering of common stock at $5 per share. As a result of the reverse stock split
and the offering,  the Partnership  exchanged its 432,090  preferred  shares and
99,592  preferred stock warrants for 370,765 common shares of common stock and a
warrant to purchase  36,916 shares of common stock.  Also in connection with the
offering,  the Partnership purchased an additional 40,000 shares of common stock
at $5 per share.  The  Partnership  paid the Managing  General  Partner  venture
capital fees in 1994 totaling $24,324 relating to these transactions.

On July 8, 1994,  Xenova  Group plc  ("Xenova")  completed  its  initial  public
offering of American Depository Shares. In connection with the offering,  Xenova
effected a 1-for-2 reverse stock split. As a result,  the Partnership  exchanged
its 608,806 ordinary shares for 304,403 ordinary shares of Xenova.

During the year, the Partnership  received cash  distributions  totaling $64,000
from Nimbus Medical, L.P.

At December 31, 1994, the Partnership  wrote-off its $323,031 investment in Vaso
Products Inc. and wrote-off $801,000 and $576,000 of the cost of its investments
in Ultramed, Inc. and Bellara Medical Products Ltd., respectively.

Additionally on December 31, 1994, the Partnership's  warrant to purchase 18,750
common shares of Exocell, Inc. expired unexercised.

Competition

The  Partnership  encounters  competition  from other  entities  having  similar
investment  objectives.  Primary competition for venture capital investments has
been from venture  capital  partnerships,  venture  capital  affiliates of large
industrial  and financial  companies,  small business  investment  companies and
wealthy  individuals.  Competition has also been from foreign investors and from
large industrial and financial  companies investing directly rather than through
venture  capital  affiliates.  The Partnership has frequently been a co-investor
with other professional  venture capital investors and these  relationships have
expanded the Partnership's access to investment opportunities.

Employees

The  Partnership  has no  employees.  The Managing  General  Partner,  under the
supervision  of the  Independent  General  Partners,  manages and  controls  the
Partnership's   venture  capital  investments.   The  Managing  General  Partner
performs,  or arranges for others to perform,  the management and administrative
services  necessary for the operation of the  Partnership and is responsible for
managing the Partnership's short-term investments.

Item 2.       Properties.

The Partnership does not own or lease physical properties.

Item 3.       Legal Proceedings.

The Partnership is not a party to any material pending legal proceedings.

Item 4.       Submission of Matters to a Vote of Security Holders.

No matter was submitted to a vote of security  holders during the fourth quarter
of the fiscal year covered by this report.

                                    PART II

Item 5.   Market for Registrant's Common Equity and Related Stockholder Matters.

There is no  established  public  trading  market  for the  Units  and it is not
anticipated  that any public  market for the Units will  develop.  The number of
individual holders of Units at December 31, 1994 was approximately 6,500.

The Partnership did not make any cash distributions to Partners during the years
ended December 31, 1994 and 1993. On June 30, 1992, the Partnership  made a cash
distribution to Partners totaling $5 million; $4.9 million, or approximately $74
per Unit, to the Limited  Partners and $50,000 to the Managing  General Partner.
Cumulative cash  distributions  to Partners from inception to December 31, 1994,
total $5.7 million;  $5.65 million to the Limited Partners, or approximately $85
per Unit, and $57,000 to the Managing General Partner.

Pursuant to the Partnership's agreement of limited partnership (the "Partnership
Agreement"),  the  Partnership's  net  income  and net  realized  gains from all
sources  are  allocated  to  all  Partners,   in  proportion  to  their  capital
contributions,  until all Partners have been allocated an amount equal to 6% per
annum, simple interest, on their total Adjusted Invested Capital; i.e., original
capital contributions reduced by previous distributions (the "Priority Return").
Thereafter,  net income and net realized gains from venture capital  investments
in excess of the amount used to cover the Priority  Return are  allocated 20% to
the  Managing  General  Partner and 80% to all Partners in  proportion  to their
capital  contributions.  Any net income from non-venture  capital investments in
excess of the  amount  used to cover the  Priority  Return is  allocated  to all
Partners in  proportion  to their  capital  contributions.  Realized  losses are
allocated to all Partners in proportion to their capital contributions. However,
if realized gains had been previously  allocated in the 80-20 ratio, then losses
are allocated in the reverse order in which profits were allocated.

Item 7. Management's  Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results
        of Operations.

Liquidity and Capital Resources

During the year ended  December  31, 1994,  the  Partnership  invested  $693,000
(including  venture  capital fees  totaling  $40,000) in two existing  portfolio
companies.  At December 31, 1994, the  Partnership  had invested an aggregate of
$28.1 million in 23 portfolio companies (including acquisition costs and venture
capital fees totaling $1.9 million).  The Partnership has invested approximately
94% of its original $30 million of net  proceeds  received  from the offering of
Units.

At December 31, 1994, the  Partnership  held $2.6 million in cash and short-term
investments as follows:  $2 million in short-term  securities with maturities of
less than one year and $619,000 in an  interest-bearing  cash  account.  For the
years ended December 31, 1994,  1993 and 1992, the  Partnership  earned interest
from such investments  totaling  $105,000,  $96,000 and $247,000,  respectively.
Interest  earned from  short-term  investments  in future  periods is subject to
fluctuations  in short-term  interest  rates and changes in funds  available for
investment.  It is  anticipated  that  funds  needed to cover the  Partnership's
future  follow-on  investments  and  operating  expenses  will be obtained  from
existing cash reserves, interest earned from the short-term investment portfolio
and proceeds from the sale of portfolio investments.

Results of Operations

For the years  ended  December  31,  1994 and 1993,  the  Partnership  had a net
realized loss from  operations  of $3.2 million and $4.6 million,  respectively.
For the year ended  December 31, 1992, the  Partnership  had a net realized gain
from  operations of $1.8 million.  Net realized gain or loss from  operations is
comprised  of (i) net  realized  gains or losses from the sale or  write-off  of
portfolio  investments  and (ii) net  investment  income or loss  (interest  and
dividends less operating expenses).

Realized  Gains and  Losses  from  Portfolio  Investments  - For the year  ended
December 31, 1994, the  Partnership had a net realized loss of $2.8 million from
portfolio investments.  During March and April 1994, the Partnership sold 20,000
common shares of CliniCom in the public market for $422,000, realizing a loss of
$944,000.  Additionally at December 31, 1994, the Partnership wrote-off $166,000
of cost relating to its  remaining  4,908 shares of common stock of CliniCom due
to the continued depressed public market price of such shares. In December 1994,
the  Partnership  wrote-off  its $323,000  investment  in Vaso Products Inc. and
wrote-off  $576,000 of its $826,000  investment in Bellara Medical Products Inc.
and $801,000 of its $1.3 million  investment in Ultramed,  Inc. due to continued
business and financial difficulties at these companies.

For the year ended December 31, 1993, the Partnership had a $4 million  realized
loss from  portfolio  investments.  In March 1993, the  Partnership  sold 40,000
common  shares  of  Somatogen,  Inc.  ("Somatogen")  in the  public  market  for
$440,000,  realizing a gain of $319,000.  On December 31, 1993, the  Partnership
wrote-off  its  investments  in LMA,  Ltd.,  Oncodiagnostics,  Inc. and Advanced
Medical Technologies ("AMT") totaling $4.3 million due to financial difficulties
at these companies.

For the year ended  December 31, 1992,  the  Partnership  had a $2.3 million net
realized gain from  portfolio  investments.  In January and February  1992,  the
Partnership sold 96,500 common shares of Somatogen for $3.3 million, realizing a
gain of $3  million.  Also  during  the year,  the  Partnership  sold its equity
interest  in  Omnicare  Group  Limited  for a $325,000  cash  payment and a note
receivable  from  Abbey  Health-care  Services,  Ltd.  valued at  $89,000.  Such
transaction resulted in a realized loss of $718,000.

Investment  Income  and  Expenses  - Net  investment  loss for the  years  ended
December  31,  1994,  1993  and  1992  was  $421,000,   $540,000  and  $479,000,
respectively.  The decrease in net investment  loss for the 1994 period compared
to the 1993 period is attributable  to a decrease in operating  expenses for the
1994  period,   primarily  professional  fees  and  general  and  administrative
expenses. Operating expenses declined $118,000 from $625,000 in 1993 to $507,000
in 1994.  Professional  fees  declined  $71,000 and  general and  administrative
expenses declined $29,000 for the 1994 period compared to the 1993 period due to
certain cost control measures implemented by the Managing General Partner during
the fourth quarter of 1993.

The  increase in net  investment  loss for the 1993 period  compared to the 1992
period primarily is attributable to a $151,000  decrease in interest earned from
short-term  investments  and a $27,000  decrease in interest and dividend income
from portfolio  investments.  These decreases were partially offset by a $98,000
decrease in professional fees and a $19,000 decrease in other operating expenses
for the 1993 period.  Interest earned from short-term  investments for the years
ended  December 31, 1993 and 1992 was $96,000 and $247,000,  respectively.  This
decrease  primarily  was due to a reduction  in interest  rates  during the 1993
period and a reduction in funds  available  for  investment  in such  securities
during the 1993 period.  In March 1992, the Partnership sold shares of Somatogen
for $3.3 million.  These funds were invested in  short-term  securities  until a
distribution was made to Partners on June 30, 1992. Interest and dividend income
decreased  for the 1994 period  compared to the 1993 period due to the write-off
of $29,000 of accrued  interest  receivable from Ultramed,  Inc. during the 1993
period.

The management fee paid to the Managing General Partner pursuant to a management
agreement  between  the  Partnership  and  the  Managing  General  Partner  (the
"Management Agreement") for the years ended December 31, 1994, 1993 and 1992 was
$361,000,  $379,000 and $396,000,  respectively.  The decrease in the management
fee for each period is a result of a decline in the Partnership's net assets for
each  consecutive  year. To the extent  possible,  the  management fee and other
operating expenses are paid with funds provided from operations.  Funds provided
from operations are obtained from interest received from short-term investments,
interest and dividend income from portfolio  investments  and proceeds  received
from the sale of portfolio investments.

Unrealized   Gains  and  Losses  and  Changes  in  Unrealized   Appreciation  or
Depreciation  of Portfolio  Investments - For the year ended  December 31, 1994,
the  Partnership  had a $3.5  million  net  unrealized  loss from its  portfolio
investments,  primarily  resulting  from  the net  downward  revaluation  of its
publicly-held portfolio investments.  Additionally during the year, $2.9 million
was transferred  from unrealized loss to realized loss relating to the write-off
of  certain  portfolio  investments,   as  discussed  above.  The  $3.5  million
unrealized  loss less the $2.9 million  transfer to realized  loss resulted in a
$618,000 decrease to net unrealized appreciation of investments for 1994.

For the year ended  December  31,  1993,  the  Partnership  had a  $276,000  net
unrealized  loss from its portfolio  investments,  primarily  related to the net
downward revaluation of its publicly-held  portfolio  investments.  Additionally
during the year, the Partnership  transferred a net $3.9 million from unrealized
loss to realized  loss  related to the sale of Somatogen  common  shares and the
write-off of LMA, Ltd.,  Oncodiagnostics,  Inc. and AMT, as discussed above. The
$3.9 million  transfer to realized  loss less the $276,000 net  unrealized  loss
resulted  in  a  $3.6  million  increase  to  net  unrealized   appreciation  of
investments for 1993.

For the year ended December 31, 1992, the  Partnership had a net unrealized loss
from  its  portfolio  investments  of $1.5  million,  primarily  related  to the
downward  revaluation  of its investment in Somatogen.  Additionally  during the
year, the  Partnership  transferred a net $1.9 million from  unrealized  gain to
realized  gain related to the Omnicare  Group Limited and  Somatogen  sales,  as
discussed  above.  The $1.5  million  unrealized  loss and the $1.9  million net
transfer to realized gain resulted in a $3.4 million  decrease to net unrealized
appreciation of investments for 1992.

Net Assets - Changes to net assets resulting from operations is comprised of (i)
net realized gains and losses from operations and (ii) changes to net unrealized
appreciation  or  depreciation  of  portfolio  investments.  For the years ended
December  31, 1994,  1993 and 1992,  the  Partnership  had a net decrease in net
assets  resulting from operations of $3.9 million,  $1 million and $1.6 million,
respectively.

At December 31, 1994, the Partnership's net assets were $14.5 million, down $3.9
million from $18.4 million at December 31, 1993. This decrease resulted from the
$3.2 million net realized loss from operations and the $618,000  decrease in net
unrealized appreciation of investments for 1994.

At December 31, 1993, the Partnership's  net assets were $18.4 million,  down $1
million from $19.4 million at December 31, 1992. This decrease resulted from the
$4.6  million  net  realized  loss from  operations  offset by the $3.6  million
increase in net unrealized appreciation of investments for 1993.

At December 31, 1992, the Partnership's net assets were $19.4 million, down $6.6
million from $26 million at December 31, 1991.  This decrease  resulted from the
$3.4 million  decrease in net unrealized  appreciation of investments and the $5
million  cash  distribution  paid to  Partners  in June 1992  offset by the $1.8
million net realized gain from operations for 1992.

At  December  31,  1994,  1993 and  1992,  the net asset  value  per $500  Unit,
including an  allocation  of net  unrealized  appreciation  or  depreciation  of
investments,  was $215, $272 and $287,  respectively.  Such per Unit amounts are
based on average allocations to all Limited Partners and do not reflect specific
Limited Partner  allocations,  which are determined by the original closing date
associated with the Units held by each Limited Partner.

INDEPENDENT AUDITORS' REPORT



WestMed Venture Partners, L.P.:

We have audited the  accompanying  balance sheets of WestMed  Venture  Partners,
L.P. (the "Partnership"),  including the schedules of portfolio investments,  as
of December 31, 1994 and 1993, and the related  statements of  operations,  cash
flows,  and  changes in  partners'  capital  for each of the three  years in the
period  ended   December  31,  1994.   These   financial   statements   are  the
responsibility of the Partnership's management. Our responsibility is to express
an opinion on these financial statements based on our audits.

We  conducted  our  audits  in  accordance  with  generally   accepted  auditing
standards.  Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material
misstatement.  An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting
the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our procedures included
confirmation of securities owned at December 31, 1994 and 1993 by correspondence
with the custodian;  where  confirmation  was not possible,  we performed  other
audit  procedures.  An audit also includes  assessing the accounting  principles
used and  significant  estimates made by  management,  as well as evaluating the
overall financial statement  presentation.  We believe that our audits provide a
reasonable basis for our opinion.

In our  opinion,  such  financial  statements  present  fairly,  in all material
respects,  the financial position of WestMed Venture Partners,  L.P. at December
31,  1994 and 1993,  and the results of its  operations,  its cash flows and the
changes in its partners' capital for each of the three years in the period ended
December 31, 1994 in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles.

As explained in Note 2, the financial  statements  include  securities valued at
$11,953,915  and  $14,940,130  at  December  31,  1994 and  1993,  respectively,
representing  82% and 81% of net assets,  respectively,  whose  values have been
estimated   by  the  Managing   General   Partner  in  the  absence  of  readily
ascertainable  market  values.  We  have  reviewed  the  procedures  used by the
Managing General Partner in arriving at its estimate of value of such securities
and have  inspected  underlying  documentation,  and, in the  circumstances,  we
believe  the  procedures  are  reasonable  and  the  documentation  appropriate.
However,  because of the inherent  uncertainty  of  valuation,  those  estimated
values may differ  significantly from the values that would have been used had a
ready market for the securities existed, and the differences could be material.

WESTMED VENTURE PARTNERS, L.P.
NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS


1.     Organization and Purpose

WestMed Venture Partners, L.P. (the "Partnership") was formed under Delaware law
on February 5, 1987. The Partnership  operates as a business development company
under the  Investment  Company Act of 1940,  as amended.  The  Partnership  is a
closed-end  investment  fund and  accordingly  its units of limited  partnership
interest  ("Units")  are not  redeemable.  A total of 66,929  Units were sold to
limited  partners  ("Limited  Partners" and together  with the Managing  General
Partner (as hereinafter defined), the "Partners") at $500 per Unit.

The  general  partners  of  the  Partnership   include  three  individuals  (the
"Independent  General  Partners")  and the  managing  general  partner,  WestMed
Venture Management,  L.P., a Delaware limited partnership (the "Managing General
Partner" and collectively with the Independent  General  Partners,  the "General
Partners").  The  general  partner of the  Managing  General  Partner is Medical
Venture  Holdings,  Inc., a Delaware  corporation  affiliated with Oppenheimer &
Co., Inc.  ("Opco").  The limited  partners of the Managing  General Partner are
Oppenheimer  Holdings,  Inc.,  MVP  Holdings,  Inc.  and BSW,  Inc.,  a Delaware
corporation  owned  by John A.  Balkoski,  Philippe  L.  Sommer  and  Howard  S.
Wachtler.  Messrs. Sommer and Wachtler are principally  responsible for managing
the investments of the Partnership.

Opco, a member firm of the New York Stock Exchange,  the National Association of
Securities Dealers,  Inc., and all principal United States securities exchanges,
is a diversified investment banking and securities firm, a registered investment
advisor and Futures  Commission  Merchant providing a broad range of services to
individual,  corporate, and institutional clients. Opco operates in the capacity
of broker and dealer for its  customers,  as well as trader for its own account.
The services provided by Opco and its subsidiaries,  and the activities in which
it is engaged,  include  securities  brokerage,  securities  research,  customer
financing,  securities  trading,  corporate  finance,  mergers and acquisitions,
underwriting and investment advisory services.

The Partnership's  objective is to achieve  long-term capital  appreciation from
its portfolio of venture capital investments, consisting of companies engaged in
the health care industry.  The Partnership is scheduled to terminate on December
31,  1997.  However,  the  General  Partners  can  extend the term for up to two
additional  two-year periods,  if they determine that such extensions are in the
best interest of the Partnership.

2.     Summary of Significant Accounting Policies

Valuation of  Investments - Portfolio  investments  are carried at fair value as
determined  quarterly by the Managing  General  Partner under the supervision of
the Independent  General  Partners.  The fair value of  publicly-held  portfolio
securities is adjusted to the average  closing  public market price for the last
five trading days of each quarter  discounted  for sales  restrictions.  Factors
considered in the determination of an

<PAGE>


WESTMED VENTURE PARTNERS, L.P.
NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS


appropriate   discount   include   underwriter   lock-up  or  Rule  144  trading
restrictions,  insider status where the Partnership  either has a representative
serving on the board of directors of the portfolio  company under  consideration
or is greater than a 5% shareholder thereof, and other liquidity factors such as
the  size of the  Partnership's  position  in a given  company  compared  to the
trading history of the public security.  Privately-held portfolio securities are
carried at cost until significant  developments  affecting the portfolio company
provide a basis for change in valuation. The fair value of private securities is
adjusted  (i) to reflect  meaningful  third-party  transactions  in the  private
market and (ii) to reflect  significant  progress or slippage in the development
of the  company's  business such that cost no longer  reflects fair value.  As a
venture capital investment fund, the Partnership's portfolio investments involve
a high  degree of business  and  financial  risk that can result in  substantial
losses.  The Managing  General  Partner  considers such risks in determining the
fair value of the Partnership's portfolio investments.

Investment  Transactions - Investment  transactions  are recorded on the accrual
method. For portfolio  investments,  transactions are recorded on the date which
the Partnership obtains an enforceable right to demand the securities or payment
thereof.  Realized  gains  and  losses on  investments  sold are  computed  on a
specific identification basis.

Statements  of  Cash  Flows  - Cash  and  cash  equivalents  include  short-term
interest-bearing   investments  in  commercial  paper  and  other  money  market
investments.  The Partnership  considers its interest bearing cash account to be
cash equivalents.

Income Taxes - No provision  for income taxes has been made since all income and
losses are  allocable  to the partners for  inclusion  in their  respective  tax
returns.  The Partnership's net assets for financial  reporting  purposes differ
from its net assets for tax purposes. Net unrealized appreciation of $345,495 at
December 31, 1994, which was recorded for financial statement purposes,  was not
recognized for tax purposes.  Additionally, from inception to December 31, 1994,
other  timing  differences  totaling  $10.1  million,  relating to net  realized
losses,  original sales  commissions  paid and other costs of selling the Units,
have been recorded on the  Partnership's  financial  statements but have not yet
been deducted for tax purposes.

3.     Allocations of Partnership Profits and Losses

Pursuant to the Partnership's agreement of limited partnership (the "Partnership
Agreement"),  the  Partnership's  net  income  and net  realized  gains from all
sources  are  allocated  to  all  Partners,   in  proportion  to  their  capital
contributions,  until all Partners have been allocated an amount equal to 6% per
annum, simple interest, on their total Adjusted Invested Capital; i.e., original
capital contributions reduced by previous distributions (the "Priority Return").
Thereafter,  net income and net realized gains from venture capital  investments
in excess of the amount used to cover the Priority  Return are  allocated 20% to
the  Managing  General  Partner and 80% to all Partners in  proportion  to their
capital contributions. Any net income from

<PAGE>


WESTMED VENTURE PARTNERS, L.P.
NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS


non-venture  capital  investments  in  excess  of the  amount  used to cover the
Priority  Return is  allocated to all Partners in  proportion  to their  capital
contributions.  Realized  losses are  allocated to all Partners in proportion to
their capital  contributions.  However,  if realized  gains had been  previously
allocated in the 80-20 ratio,  then losses are allocated in the reverse order in
which  profits were  allocated.  From its  inception  to December 31, 1994,  the
Partnership  had a $9.3  million  net  realized  loss from its  venture  capital
investments.

4.     Related Party Transactions

Pursuant to the Partnership Agreement,  the Managing General Partner is entitled
to receive a one-time venture capital fee equal to 5% of the gross proceeds from
the sale of Units. Such fee is incurred as portfolio investments are made in the
proportion of the cost of each portfolio investment to the net proceeds from the
sale of Units. Venture capital fees incurred are recorded as a cost of acquiring
the portfolio investments. For the years ended December 31, 1994, 1993 and 1992,
the Partnership incurred venture capital fees of $40,000,  $10,000 and $104,000,
respectively.  Cumulative  venture  capital  fees  incurred  from  inception  to
December 31, 1994 totaled $1.6 million.

Pursuant to a  management  agreement  between the  Partnership  and the Managing
General Partner,  the Managing General Partner performs,  or arranges for others
to perform,  the  management,  administrative  and certain  investment  advisory
services necessary for the operation of the Partnership.  For such services, the
Managing  General Partner  receives a management fee at the annual rate of 2% of
the lesser of the net assets of the Partnership or the net  contributed  capital
of the Partnership; i.e., gross capital contributions to the Partnership (net of
selling commissions and organizational expenses) reduced by capital distributed.
Such fee is determined and payable quarterly.

For services rendered to the Partnership,  each of the three Independent General
Partners  receives a $5,000 annual fee and  reimbursement  for all out-of-pocket
expenses relating to attendance at meetings of the General Partners.

5.     Cash Distributions

No cash  distributions  were paid to Partners in 1994 or 1993. In June 1992, the
Partnership made a cash  distribution to Limited Partners of record on March 31,
1992, totaling $4.9 million, or approximately $74 per $500 Unit. The Partnership
also made a cash  distribution  to the  Managing  General  Partner  of  $49,900.
Cumulative cash  distributions  paid to Limited Partners from inception  through
December 31, 1994 total $5.7 million, or approximately $85 per $500 Unit.

Item 10.      Directors and Executive Officers.

The Independent General Partners

The Independent  General Partners have full authority over the management of the
Partnership  and provide overall  guidance and  supervision  with respect to the
operations  of the  Partnership  and perform the various  duties  imposed on the
general  partners  of  business  development  companies  under the 1940 Act.  In
addition to general fiduciary duties,  the Independent  General Partners,  among
other things,  supervise the management  arrangements  of the  Partnership,  the
custody  arrangement  with respect to  portfolio  securities,  the  selection of
accountants,  fidelity  bonding  and  the  activities  of the  Managing  General
Partner. As required by the 1940 Act, a majority of the general partners must be
individuals  who are not  "interested  persons" of the Partnership as defined in
the 1940  Act.  In 1987,  the  Securities  and  Exchange  Commission  issued  an
exemptive  order  declaring  that  Messrs.   Elliott,   Taylor  and  White,  the
Independent General Partners of the Partnership, are not "interested persons" of
the  Partnership  as  defined  in the 1940 Act  solely by reason of their  being
general  partners of the  Partnership.  Such individuals also comprise the Audit
Committee of the Partnership.

the portfolio investments. For the years ended December 31, 1994, 1993 and 1992,
