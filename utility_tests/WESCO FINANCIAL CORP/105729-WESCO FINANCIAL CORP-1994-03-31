PART I
 
ITEM 1.  BUSINESS
 
GENERAL
 
     Wesco Financial Corporation ("Wesco") was incorporated in Delaware on March
19, 1959. The principal businesses of Wesco, conducted by wholly owned
subsidiaries, have been (1) the savings and loan business, through Mutual
Savings and Loan Association, subsequently renamed MSMLMIC ("Mutual Savings"),
which was incorporated in California in 1925 and gave up its status as a
regulated thrift institution after disposing of its savings accounts and most of
its real estate loans in October 1993, (2) the property and casualty insurance
business, through Wesco-Financial Insurance Company ("Wes-FIC"), which was
incorporated in 1985, and (3) the steel service center business, through
Precision Steel Warehouse, Inc. ("Precision Steel"), which was begun in 1940 and
acquired by Wesco in 1979.
 
     Wesco's operations also include, through MS Property Company ("MS
Property"), the ownership and management of commercial real estate transferred
to MS Property by Wesco, and the development and liquidation of foreclosed real
estate and delinquent real estate loans transferred to MS Property by Mutual
Savings, all in December 1993, when MS Property began its operations. Wesco's
operations have also included the manufacture of electrical equipment through
New America Electrical Corporation ("New America Electric"), which was organized
in 1982, has been approximately 80%-owned by Wesco since December 1988, and sold
its business and commenced liquidation in mid-1993. Wesco also has investments
in securities.
 
     Since 1973, Wesco has been 80.1% owned by Blue Chip Stamps (or its
predecessor by the same name), a wholly owned subsidiary of Berkshire Hathaway
Inc. ("Berkshire"). Wesco and its subsidiaries are thus controlled by Blue Chip
Stamps and Berkshire. All of these companies may also be deemed to be controlled
by Warren E. Buffett, who is Berkshire's chairman and chief executive officer
and owner of 40.7% of its stock. Charles T. Munger, the chairman of Wesco, is
also vice chairman of Berkshire, and consults with Mr. Buffett with respect to
Wesco's investment decisions and major capital allocations, but Mr. Buffett has
no active participation in Wesco's management.
 
     Wesco's activities fall into three business segments -- financial,
insurance, and industrial. The financial segment, through 1993 yearend, included
the savings and loan business. (Effective January 1, 1994, the remainder of the
savings and loan business -- the portion that had employed the majority of its
assets, in terms of market value, in indirect real estate lending through
ownership of 7.2 million shares of common stock of Federal Home Loan Mortgage
Corporation ("Freddie Mac") and mortgage-backed securities -- became part of the
insurance segment upon Mutual Savings' statutory merger into Wes-FIC.) Also
included in the financial segment are (a) MS Property's ownership and management
of commercial real estate as well as its development and liquidation of
foreclosed real estate and delinquent real estate loans, and (b) investments,
principally in common and preferred stocks. The insurance segment has, through
1993 yearend, comprised the property and casualty insurance business. (In 1994
it also includes the indirect real estate lending business formerly engaged in
by Mutual Savings.) The industrial segment includes steel service center
operations and, until mid-1993, also included electrical products business
activity. The amounts of revenues, operating profit and identifiable assets
attributable to each of these three business segments are included in Note 9 to
Wesco's consolidated financial statements contained in Item 8, Financial
Statements.
 
FINANCIAL SEGMENT
 
     The savings and loan business has been a difficult business since the late
1970s as explained in detail in previous annual reports. Mutual Savings and
Wesco have dealt with increasing savings and loan regulations and regulatory
pressures, particularly over the past five years, with the result that
management decided as of 1992 yearend that Mutual Savings would give up its
status as a regulated savings and loan association. The decision was prompted,
in part, by regulatory insistence that Mutual
 
                                       14
<PAGE>   3
 
Savings make additional changes in its business above and beyond those
previously made. Management believed such additional changes, if implemented,
would further increase operating expenses, and possibly narrow the spread
between interest income and interest expense, thereby resulting in an
unacceptable return to its owners. To achieve its objective, on October 8, 1993,
Mutual Savings consummated its previously announced agreement with CenFed Bank,
A Federal Savings Bank ("CenFed"), following receipt of regulatory approvals.
Mutual Savings transferred its savings accounts and certain other liabilities
(totaling about $220 million) to CenFed, offset by substantially all of its real
estate loans and certain other non-cash assets (about $86 million, combined) and
cash (about $134 million). Pursuant to the agreement, Wesco loaned $4 million to
CenFed's parent corporation for a three-year period, with interest initially at
prime rate. In addition, Mutual Savings and Wesco jointly agreed to indemnify
CenFed to the extent of at least 90% with respect to any losses that might be
sustained on the loans transferred. After provision for such indemnification,
the CenFed transaction resulted in an after-tax gain of $905,000, or $.13 per
Wesco share.
 
     Following completion of the foregoing transaction, and the withdrawal by
Mutual Savings and by Wesco from savings and loan regulation, (1) Mutual Savings
transferred all of its foreclosed real estate, and the few real estate loans
that were not sold to CenFed, to MS Property, which is continuing the slow
liquidation of those assets begun by Mutual Savings; and (2) Wesco transferred
its commercial real estate property in Pasadena, California, to MS Property,
which is now managing it.
 
     Mutual Savings retained a majority (at market value) of its former assets,
consisting mostly of stock of Freddie Mac (market approximately $359 million
versus cost of about $72 million at 1993 yearend) and indirect loans in the form
of approximately $46 million of securitized mortgages. Immediately after 1993
yearend Mutual Savings merged into Wes-FIC, which will continue to engage in the
mortgage business and make business use of the portion of Mutual Savings'
business that in recent years employed the majority of its assets. The
continuation of this business will be regulated by the Nebraska Department of
Insurance, replacing federal and California thrift regulators.
 
     Wesco, while it seeks suitable businesses to acquire or to expand its
existing operations, invests in marketable securities, including common stocks
of unaffiliated companies held outside its insurance subsidiary. (See Note 2 to
the accompanying consolidated financial statements for a summary of all
investments, both inside and outside Wesco's insurance subsidiary. See Schedule
I accompanying such statements for further information.)
 
     Eleven full-time employees are engaged in the financial segment activities.
 
INSURANCE SEGMENT
 
     Wes-FIC was incorporated in 1985 to engage in the property and casualty
insurance and reinsurance business. Wesco has contributed approximately $103
million cash to Wes-FIC's capital since Wes-FIC's date of incorporation. On
January 1, 1994, as a result of Mutual Savings' merger into Wes-FIC, the latter
received an additional net contribution of approximately $240 million, of which
$187 million related to Freddie Mac stock (unrealized appreciation of $287
million less $100 million of income taxes deemed applicable thereto).
 
     In 1985, Wes-FIC entered into an arrangement whereby it
reinsured -- through a Berkshire insurance subsidiary, National Indemnity
Company ("NICO"), as intermediary-without-profit -- 2% of the entire book of
insurance business of the long-established Fireman's Fund Insurance Companies
("Fireman's Fund"). Wes-FIC thus assumed the benefits and burdens of Fireman's
Fund's prices, costs and losses under a contract covering all insurance premiums
earned by Fireman's Fund during a four-year coverage period that expired on
August 31, 1989. The arrangement put Wes-FIC in virtually the same position it
would have been in if it, instead of Fireman's Fund, had directly written the
business reinsured. Differences in results under this arrangement have occurred
principally from the investment of premiums, as Wes-FIC, instead of Fireman's
Fund, has invested funds from "float" (funds set aside and invested pending
payment of claims). Wes-FIC will remain liable for its share of
 
                                       15
<PAGE>   4
 
unpaid losses and loss expenses, which have been reflected on Wesco's balance
sheet, and will continue to invest funds offset by loss reserves until runoff is
complete, perhaps many years hence.
 
     In 1990 and 1991, Wes-FIC reinsured 50% of the book of workers'
compensation insurance business of Cypress Insurance Company ("Cypress"), a
wholly owned subsidiary of Berkshire, under a contract patterned generally after
that with Fireman's Fund. As with the Fireman's Fund contract, Wes-FIC will
remain liable for its share of unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses, as
well as policyholder dividends.
 
     During 1992, Wes-FIC entered into another arrangement with NICO whereby
NICO retroceded to it 50% of certain personal lines reinsurance business NICO
had assumed. The arrangement was terminated in mid-1993, when the original
source of the reinsurance stopped making cessions to NICO.
 
     In recent years, financial failures in the insurance industry have received
considerable attention from news media, regulatory authorities, rating agencies
and Congress. As one result, industry participants and the public have been made
more aware of the benefits derived from dealing with insurers whose financial
resources support their promises with significant margins of safety against
adversity. In this respect Wes-FIC is competitively well positioned, inasmuch as
its premiums written in 1993 amounted to approximately 2% of its statutory
surplus compared to an industry average of about 140% based on figures reported
for 1992.
 
     Wes-FIC's unusual strength, following the absorption of Mutual Savings, has
enabled it to enter into the business of "super-catastrophe" reinsurance,
through five subcontracts entered into with NICO at favorable terms in February
1994. Super-catastrophe reinsurance is the insurance that insurance companies
buy from other insurance companies to protect themselves against major
catastrophic losses. An insurer in this business must have large net worth in
relation to annual premiums in order to remain solvent when called upon to pay
claims when a large super catastrophe occurs.
 
     Berkshire has indicated that its insurance subsidiaries may from time to
time be offered super catastrophe reinsurance business that is somewhat larger
than it wishes to retain and may make a portion of the business available to
Wes-FIC, as NICO did in the case of the aforementioned five subcontracts.
Wesco's and Wes-FIC's boards of directors have authorized automatic acceptance
of future retrocessions of reinsurance offered by wholly owned subsidiaries of
Berkshire provided the following guidelines and limitations are complied with:
(1) in order not to delay the acceptance process, the retrocession will be
accepted without delay in writing in Nebraska by agents of Wes-FIC who are
salaried employees of Berkshire subsidiaries; (2) the Berkshire subsidiary will
receive a ceding commission of 3% of premiums, probably less than the Berkshire
subsidiary could get in the marketplace; (3) Wes-FIC will assume 20% or less of
the risk (before taking into account effects of the ceding commission); (4)
wholly owned Berkshire subsidiaries will retain at least 80% of the identical
risk (again, before taking into account effects of the ceding commission); and
(5) the aggregate premiums from this type of business in any twelve-month period
will not exceed 10% of Wes-FIC's net worth.
 
     Wes-FIC also writes direct business, as distinguished from reinsurance. It
is licensed in Nebraska, Utah and Iowa, and wrote $41,000 and earned $51,000 in
direct premiums in 1993.
 
     Wesco's and Wes-FIC's boards are hopeful, but have no assurance, that
additional reinsurance retrocessions or other insurance arrangements, including
those similar to the Fireman's Fund contract, will become available to Wes-FIC.
 
     Insurance companies are subject to regulation by the departments of
insurance of the various states in which they operate. Regulations relate to,
among other things, capital requirements, shareholder and policyholders'
dividend restrictions, reporting requirements, periodic regulatory examinations,
and limitations on the size and types of investments that can be made.

INDUSTRIAL SEGMENT
 
     Precision Steel, acquired in 1979 for approximately $15 million, operates a
well-established steel service center business in two locations: one in Franklin
Park, Illinois, near Chicago; the other, operated by a wholly owned subsidiary,
in Charlotte, North Carolina. The service centers buy low carbon sheet and strip
steel, coated metals, spring steels, stainless steel, brass, phosphor bronze,
aluminum and other metals, cut these metals to order, and sell them to a wide
variety of customers.
 
     The service center business is highly competitive. Precision Steel's annual
sales volume of approximately 30 thousand tons compares with the steel service
industry's annual volume of over 20 million tons. Precision Steel competes not
only with other service centers but also with mills which supply metal to the
service centers. Competition exists in the areas of price, quality, availability
of products and speed of delivery. Because it is willing to sell in relatively
small quantities, Precision Steel has been able to compete in geographic areas
distant from its service center facilities. Competitive pressure is intensified
by imports and by a tendency of domestic manufacturers to substitute less costly
components for parts traditionally made of steel.
 
     Precision Brand Products, Inc. ("Precision Brand"), a wholly owned
subsidiary of Precision Steel, manufactures shim stock and other tool room
specialty items, as well as hose and muffler clamps, and sells them under its
own brand names nationwide, generally through industrial distributors. This
business is highly competitive. Precision Brand's share of the toolroom
specialty products market is believed to approximate 0.5%; statistics are not
available with respect to its share of the market for hose and muffler clamps.
 
     Steel service raw materials are obtained principally from major domestic
steel mills, and their availability is considered good. Precision Steel's
service centers maintain extensive inventories in order to meet customer demand
for prompt deliveries. Typically, an order is filled and the processed metals
delivered to the customer within two weeks. Precision Brand normally maintains
inventories adequate to allow for off-the-shelf service to customers within 24
hours.
 
     The steel service businesses are subject to economic cycles. These
businesses are not dependent on a few large customers. Steel service backlog of
orders approximated $5.2 million as of December 31, 1993, unchanged from the
figure as of December 31, 1992.
 
     Approximately 250 full-time employees are engaged in the steel service
business, about 40% of whom are members of unions. Management considers labor
relations to be good.
 
ITEM 2. PROPERTIES
 
     MS Property owns a business block in downtown Pasadena, California, which
is improved with a nine-story office building that was constructed in 1964 and
has approximately 125,000 square feet of net rentable area, as well as three
commercial store buildings and a multistory garage with space for 425
automobiles. Of the 125,000 square feet of office space, approximately 3,000
square feet are used by Wesco and MS Property as their headquarters. Most of the
remainder is leased to outside parties, including CenFed, law firms and others,
under agreements expiring at various dates to 2008. MS Property also owns a
parking lot with space for approximately 100 automobiles across the street from
the multistory structure.
 
     Wes-FIC uses as its place of business the Omaha, Nebraska headquarters
office of NICO.
 
     MS Property holds real estate acquired by Mutual Savings or itself through
foreclosure. The most valuable parcel, acquired in 1966, consisted of 22 acres
of largely oceanfront land near Santa Barbara, California, where a luxury
development consisting of 20 townhomes and 12 residential lots has been under
construction, with several sales recorded to date. Other properties include
several buildings in a small shopping center in Upland, California, which are
leased to various small businesses, and several single-family residences in
Southern California, presently listed for sale.
 
                                       17
<PAGE>   6
      Precision Steel and its subsidiaries own three buildings housing their
plant and office facilities, having usable area approximately as follows:
138,000 square feet in Franklin Park, Illinois; 63,000 square feet in Charlotte,
North Carolina; and 59,000 square feet in Downers Grove, Illinois.
 
ITEM 3. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS
 
     Wesco and its subsidiaries are not involved in any legal proceedings which
are expected to result in material loss.
 

ITEM 4. SUBMISSION OF MATTERS TO A VOTE OF SECURITY HOLDERS
 
     No matters were submitted to a vote of Wesco's shareholders subsequent to
the annual meeting held in May 1993.

* Wesco elected to adopt SFAS No. 115, "Accounting for Certain Investments in
  Debt and Equity Securities", effective at 1993 yearend, with the result that
  all marketable equity securities owned by Wesco and its subsidiaries at 1993
  yearend are carried at market value, with the aggregate unrealized gain added
  to shareholders' equity net of deemed applicable income taxes.
 
ITEM 7.  MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS
         OF OPERATIONS
 
FINANCIAL CONDITION
 
     The financial condition of Wesco Financial Corporation ("Wesco") continues
to be very sound. Its net worth is greater than ever due to continued successful
operations as well as continued appreciation of marketable securities. Its
liquidity in terms of cash equivalents is adequate for all operating and other
current needs. Other resources are available such as liquidation of marketable
securities and borrowings from banks and others.
 
     Wesco's shareholders' equity (net worth) at December 31, 1993 was $626
million. Of this amount, $309 million represented unrealized appreciation of
marketable equity securities, less income taxes that would have to be paid upon
sale of the securities assuming continuation of current tax rates. At December
31, 1992, Wesco's shareholders' equity, under generally accepted accounting
principles then in effect, was $412 million. (If SFAS No. 115, "Accounting for
Certain Investments in Debt and Equity Securities," had been available for
adoption by Wesco in 1992 instead of 1993, Wesco's shareholders' equity at
December 31, 1992 would have been stated at $582 million, of which $278 million
would have represented unrealized appreciation of marketable equal securities
less deemed applicable income taxes.)
 
     Borrowings from banks and others have been available to Wesco and its
subsidiaries under attractive terms for a number of years. In October 1989, in
connection with a $30 million Wesco note offering, Standard and Poor's
Corporation issued a credit rating of Wesco debt of AA+. Wesco has not
 
                                       20
<PAGE>   9
 
gone to the credit markets since 1989, but it hopes that any future borrowings
will elicit the highest possible credit rating, AAA.
 
     Wesco's Mutual Savings subsidiary, prior to sale of most of its real estate
loans, did not suffer the crippling loan losses reported by much of the savings
and loan industry in recent years. Mutual Savings did, however, experience some
loan losses and some increasing deterioration of collateral value due mainly to
recessionary economic conditions and decreasing real estate values in Southern
California.
 
     Mutual Savings, in connection with its sale of $81 million of real estate
loans, indemnified CenFed against any losses that might ultimately be sustained
to the extent of at least 90% of each loss. However, Wesco does not believe that
the indemnification will have a significant effect on its financial condition,
because (1) the loans are first-mortgage real estate loans mainly on owner-
occupied, single-family residences, and (2) Mutual Savings' seriously delinquent
loans were retained and thus not transferred to CenFed.
 
     In addition to mainly delinquent loans, Mutual Savings retained properties
that it had obtained through foreclosure. The most significant of these is an
upscale oceanfront development in Montecito, near Santa Barbara, California,
which, after a $2 million writedown to estimated net realizable value, was
recorded on the books at 1993 yearend at $23 million. Other foreclosed
properties and real estate loans had an aggregate book value at 1993 yearend of
$7 million, net of reserves for loss. These assets, now owned by MS Property,
are not expected to expose Wesco to significant detrimental effect in the
realization of their values.
 
     Wesco is not now suffering from inflation, but its insurance and industrial
segments have potential exposure. Very large unanticipated changes in the rate
of inflation could adversely impact the insurance business, because premium
rates are established well in advance of incurrence of the related costs.
Precision Steel's steel service businesses are competitive and operate on tight
gross profit margins, and thus its earnings are susceptible to bad effects from
inflationary cost increases. As a result of Mutual Savings' disposition of its
savings accounts and most of its real estate loans, the financial segment now
has relatively minor exposure to inflation.
 
RESULTS OF OPERATIONS
 
     The savings and loan industry has been in considerable turmoil for many
years. In response to perceived uncertainties in that industry, Wesco in the
1970s began to diversify its operations. Mutual Savings' activities declined
both in size and in relative importance to Wesco's consolidated operations
until, finally, its savings deposits and most loans were disposed of in late
1993. Meanwhile, the portfolio of investment securities has grown, mostly inside
the savings and loan and insurance subsidiaries, and dividend and interest
income and realized and unrealized gains on securities have increased in
importance to Wesco. Steel service operations were added in 1979, property and
casualty insurance operations were added in 1985, and electrical equipment
manufacturing operations (sold in mid-1993) were added at 1988 yearend. (See
Item 1, Business, for further discussion of Wesco's operations.)

</TABLE>
 
     Mutual Savings' consolidated "normal" net operating income remained
relatively stable during 1991 and 1992, as shown in the foregoing table. Had it
not been for a significant increase in provision for losses on loans and real
estate held for sale in 1993 (mainly a $2 million pre-tax writedown of the
Montecito development at the end of 1993), the 1993 figure would also have been
comparable to those of the two preceding years.
 
     Mutual Savings was operated with a view towards minimizing downside risk
and with an overriding commitment to maintaining a higher ratio of shareholders'
equity than was required under the strictest regulatory standards. As of
September 30, 1993, just prior to the CenFed transaction and Mutual Savings'
exit from thrift regulation, Mutual Savings' book net worth amounted to 18.0% of
assets, versus 15.0% as of December 31, 1992; these figures are based on assets
carried at historical cost, not market value, as would have been the case at
1993 yearend, when Wesco adopted SFAS No. 115 (see Note 1 to the accompanying
consolidated financial statements).
 
     Mutual Savings' operations as a regulated savings and loan association
ceased as of October 8, 1993 upon the consummation of the transaction with
CenFed described in Item 1, Business. As a result, several of the items of
revenue and expense appearing in the foregoing table will wholly or partially
disappear, notably interest income on loans, interest expense on savings
accounts and operating expenses. Following Mutual Savings' merger into Wes-FIC
effective January 1, 1994, most of the other items of revenue and expense will
be included in the insurance segment.
 
Insurance Segment
 
     Wesco entered into the property and casualty insurance business in
September 1985 through Wes-FIC, a newly formed subsidiary. Substantially all of
its insurance business to date has been derived through arrangements with NICO
and Cypress, wholly owned subsidiaries of Berkshire, Wesco's ultimate parent.
Under the arrangements, Wes-FIC has been ceded portions of the property and
casualty reinsurance business of NICO and has reinsured workers' compensation
business written by Cypress, in relatively short-lived arrangements.
 
                                       23
<PAGE>   12
 
     Arrangements with NICO comprised (1) reinsurance of 2% of the property and
casualty insurance business of Fireman's Fund during a four-year coverage period
that expired on August 31, 1989, and (2) reinsurance of 50% of certain personal
lines reinsurance business that NICO had assumed in an arrangement that
accounted for substantially all of Wes-FIC's earned premiums in 1992 and 1993,
and which terminated in mid-1993 when the original source of the reinsurance
stopped making cessions to NICO. The arrangement with Cypress accounted for most
of Wes-FIC's earned premiums for 1991. Wes-FIC has also written small amounts of
direct insurance business. (See Item 1, Business, for further information on
Wes-FIC, NICO, Cypress, Berkshire and Fireman's Fund.)
 
     The "normal" net operating income of Wes-FIC (i.e., income before
securities gains and, in 1993, unusual income tax charges or credits) represents
the combination of its underwriting results with the interest and dividend
income from its investment activities. Following is a summary of such data (in
thousands):

</TABLE>
 
     Underwriting results in the property and casualty insurance business are
necessarily based on estimates and actuarial assumptions, and tend to be
cyclical. Results were disastrous for many insurers for several years prior to
Wes-FIC's entry into the insurance business, as price competition, inflation and
new judicial notions tended to extend insurance coverages beyond limits
contemplated when policies were issued. Several financial failures had occurred
in the industry. The result was a decrease in the industry's insuring capacity
(basically a multiple of its capital). This decreased capacity enabled insurers,
beginning in 1985, to increase prices (premium rates) significantly, as well as
to become more selective in their underwriting. When Wes-FIC entered into the
four-year Fireman's Fund reinsurance arrangement, the cycle appeared to have
become favorable for property and casualty insurers. But shortly thereafter,
price competition increased, and additional reinsurance at satisfactory prices
became unavailable.
 
     Wes-FIC's low volume in insurance underwriting in most recent years has
been attributable mainly to management's perception that opportunity to write
more business at sensible rates has not been available to Wes-FIC, given general
industry-wide conditions. Meanwhile, Wes-FIC has been actively pursuing other
insurance and reinsurance opportunities, including insurance company
acquisitions, and in early 1994 entered the super-catastrophe reinsurance
business (see Item 1, Business).
 
     Wes-FIC remains liable for runoff of its share of the losses and loss
expenses covered by the insurance arrangements summarized above. As claims are
paid over many future years, the liability (approximately $54 million as of
December 31, 1993) will decline, as will the funds set aside and invested
pending payment of claims ("float").
 
                                       24
<PAGE>   13
 
     Interest and dividend income has been earned by Wes-FIC (1) on insurance
premium float, (2) on capital contributed to the insurance business by Wesco
(approximately $100 million through 1993), and (3) on earnings retained and
reinvested.
 
     The income tax provision of Wes-FIC has fluctuated as a percentage of its
pre-tax income in each of the periods presented in the table on the preceding
page. These fluctuations have been caused by fluctuations in the relationship of
substantially tax-exempt components of income to total pre-tax income.
 
     Insurance losses and loss expenses, and the related liabilities reflected
on Wesco's consolidated balance sheet, because they are based in large part upon
estimates, are subject to estimation error. Revisions of such estimates in
future periods could significantly affect the results of operations reported for
future periods. However, Wes-FIC has maintained a capital position strong enough
not only to absorb adverse estimation corrections but also to enable it to
accept other insurance contracts. The increase in Wes-FIC's capital resulting
from its absorption of Mutual Savings by statutory merger on January 1, 1994
enabled it to enter the super-catastrophe insurance business shortly thereafter
through five sub-contracts with NICO, as described in Item 1, Business. Although
additional reinsurance retrocessions from Berkshire subsidiaries, or other
attractive reinsurance or insurance arrangements with Berkshire subsidiaries or
other parties, would be welcome, an increase in Wes-FIC's insurance underwriting
activity, immediately or in the future, cannot be predicted.

</TABLE>
 
     Revenues of the industrial segment have remained relatively unchanged in
each of the past three years notwithstanding the inclusion of only six months of
revenues from the operations of New America Electric in the 1993 figure. (New
America Electric accounted for $3.5 million, $7.4 million and $7.9 million of
revenues for 1993, 1992 and 1991.)
 
     Income before income taxes and normal net operating income of the
industrial segment were negatively affected for each of the past three years as
a result of the inclusion of the operating results of New America Electric. Had
it not been for Wesco's equity of $213,000, $243,000 and $132,000 in 1993, 1992
and 1991 in New America Electric's after-tax operating losses, the industrial
segment would have reported normal net operating income of $2,189,000,
$2,075,000 and $1,414,000 for 1993, 1992 and 1991. The fluctuations in these
earnings figures were attributable in 1993 mainly to Precision Steel's ongoing
efforts to reduce operating expenses and, in 1992, to a lower-than-usual cost of
products sold as a percentage of steel service revenues (this percentage was
81.2%, 80.6% and 82.6% for 1993, 1992 and 1991). The cost percentage typically
fluctuates slightly from year to year as a result of changes in product mix,
price competition among suppliers and at the retail level, and availability of
favorable quantity order prices on materials purchased.
 
     The operations of Precision Steel appear to have been less affected by
recessionary economic conditions in the past two years than previously.

     Management's long-term goal is to maximize gain in Wesco's intrinsic
business value per share, with little regard to earnings recorded in any given
year. There is no particular strategy as to the timing of sales of investments
or the realization of securities gains. Securities may be sold for a variety of
reasons, including (1) the belief that prospects for future appreciation of a
particular investment are less attractive than the prospects for reinvestment of
the after-tax proceeds from its sale, (2) the desire for funds for an
acquisition or repayment of debt, or (3) regulatory requirements, as was the
case in prior years when securities were sold as required by new savings and
loan laws.
 
     Realized securities gains have been an element of Wesco's net income for a
number of years. The amounts of these gains, recorded when appreciated
securities are sold, tend to fluctuate significantly from period to period. The
varying effect upon Wesco's pre-tax income is evident on the face of the
consolidated statement of income. The amount of realized gain for any period has
no predictive value, and variations in amount from period to period have no
practical analytical value, particularly in view of the existence of substantial
unrealized price appreciation in Wesco's consolidated investment portfolio.
Realized securities gains amounted to $1.2 million, $0.1 million and $5.8
million after income taxes in 1993, 1992 and 1991.
 
     As explained in the second paragraph of this Item 7, unrealized
appreciation of all Wesco's marketable equity securities -- not just those of
its Wes-FIC insurance subsidiary, as in the past -- is included in the
consolidated balance sheet net of deemed applicable income taxes, effective as
of 1993 yearend. The Financial Accounting Standards Board required (in SFAS No.
115) that the net writeup be credited directly to shareholders' equity without
figuring in any way in the determination of net income, the same, sensible
procedure that had been followed for insurance entities. However, in another
pronouncement (SFAS No. 109) -- which required, among other things, adjusting
deferred income tax liabilities to reflect tax rate changes -- the FASB directed
that all such tax adjustments not bypass net income; thus, Wesco's 1993 net
income was penalized by $1.6 million due to an increase in the federal rate from
34% to 35% on Wes-FIC's unrealized appreciation, notwithstanding the fact that
the appreciation had never benefited net income.
 
     Wesco's consolidated revenues include significant amounts of substantially
tax-exempt dividend income from preferred and common stocks as well as fully
tax-exempt interest on state and municipal bonds. Fluctuations in the proportion
of these components to total consolidated pre-tax income -- plus a special tax
provision of $17.5 million recorded as of 1992 yearend, and $2.1 million in 1993
to give effect to the tax rate increase applicable to deferred tax items
(including the $1.6 million discussed in the preceding paragraph) -- have
resulted in tax provisions as percentages of pre-tax income before cumulative
effect of change in accounting principle of 21.3%, 80.7% and 14.7% in 1993, 1992
and 1991. (See Note 6 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements for
further information on income taxes.)
 
     Consolidated revenues, expenses and earnings set forth in Item 6, Selected
Financial Data, and in Wesco's consolidated statement of income, are not
necessarily indicative of future revenues, expenses and earnings, in that they
are subject to significant variations in amount and timing of securities gains
and losses and the possible occurrence of other unusual items. In addition, as
explained above, in October 1993, Mutual Savings, after transferring savings
accounts and some mortgage loans to CenFed, gave up its status as a regulated
savings and loan association. Then, on January 1, 1994, Mutual Savings merged
into Wes-FIC, which will thereafter continue to engage in the mortgage business
and make business use of the majority of its assets. It is anticipated that the
merger will not only result in elimination of nonproductive overhead needed to
maintain compliance with savings and loan laws and regulations, but will also
increase reinsurance capacity and asset-deployment options. The effects on
future operations of these changes, however, while possibly beneficial, are not
subject to estimation.

                          INDEPENDENT AUDITORS' REPORT
 
To the Board of Directors and Shareholders of
Wesco Financial Corporation
 
     We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Wesco
Financial Corporation and subsidiaries as of December 31, 1993 and 1992, and the
related consolidated statements of income and retained earnings and cash flows
for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 1993. Our audits
also included financial statement schedules listed in the index at Item 8. These
financial statements and financial statement schedules are the responsibility of
the Corporation's management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on
these financial statements and financial statement schedules based on our
audits.
 
     We conducted our audits in accordance with generally accepted auditing
standards. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material
misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting
the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. An audit also includes
assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by
management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation.
We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.
 
     In our opinion, such consolidated financial statements present fairly, in
all material respects, the financial position of Wesco Financial Corporation and
subsidiaries as of December 31, 1993 and 1992, and the results of their
operations and their cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended
December 31, 1993, in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles.
Also, in our opinion, such financial statement schedules, when considered in
relation to the basic financial statements taken as a whole, present fairly, in
all material respects, the information set forth therein.
 
     As discussed in Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements, in 1993
the Company changed its methods of accounting for income taxes and investments
to conform with recent pronouncements of the Financial Accounting Standards
Board.

                   NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
           (DOLLAR AMOUNTS IN THOUSANDS EXCEPT FOR AMOUNTS PER SHARE)
 
NOTE 1.  PRESENTATION AND CONSOLIDATION
 
     Wesco Financial Corporation ("Wesco") is 80.1%-owned by Blue Chip Stamps
("Blue Chip"), which in turn is wholly owned by Berkshire Hathaway Inc.
("Berkshire").
 
     The consolidated financial statements of Wesco include the accounts of
Wesco and its subsidiaries, which are all either directly or indirectly wholly
owned. These subsidiaries -- most importantly Mutual Savings and Loan
Association ("Mutual Savings"), newly formed MS Property Company ("MS
Property"), Wesco-Financial Insurance Company ("Wes-FIC") and Precision Steel
Warehouse, Inc. ("Precision Steel") -- are engaged in several diverse
businesses. Another Wesco subsidiary (approximately 80%-owned), New America
Electrical Corporation ("New America Electric"), on July 1, 1993 sold its
business assets and commenced liquidation; Wesco realized an after-tax loss of
$1,617 ($.23 per share) on the sale. See Note 9 for Wesco's consolidated
financial information classified by business segment.
 
     On October 8, 1993, Mutual Savings consummated its previously announced
agreement with CenFed Bank, A Federal Savings Bank ("CenFed"), following receipt
of regulatory approvals. Mutual Savings transferred its savings accounts and
certain other liabilities (totaling about $220,000) to CenFed, offset by (1)
substantially all of its real estate loans and certain other non-cash assets
(about $85,000, combined) and cash (about $135,000). Pursuant to the Agreement,
Wesco loaned $4 million to CenFed's parent corporation for a three-year period,
with interest initially at the prime rate. In addition, Mutual Savings and Wesco
jointly agreed to indemnify CenFed to the extent of at least 90% with respect to
any losses that might be sustained on the loans transferred. After provision for
indemnification for any such losses, the CenFed transaction resulted in an
after-tax gain of $906, or $.13 per Wesco share.
 
     Following completion of the foregoing transaction, (1) Mutual Savings
transferred certain assets, consisting principally of Mutual Savings' foreclosed
real estate and the small number of real estate loans that were not sold to
CenFed, to MS Property, which will conduct a slow liquidation of those assets,
and (2) Wesco transferred to MS Property its commercial real estate property in
Pasadena, California.
 
     Mutual Savings retained a majority (at market value) of its former assets,
consisting mostly of stock of Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation ("Freddie
Mac") and indirect loans in the form of securitized mortgages. Immediately after
1993 yearend Mutual Savings merged into Wes-FIC, which will continue to engage
in the portion of Mutual Savings' business that in recent years employed the
majority of its assets. The continuation of this business, including investment
in mortgages, will be regulated by the Nebraska Department of Insurance.
 
     Late in 1993, Mutual Savings gave up its regulatory savings and loan
status. The decision to do so, which had been made late in 1992, subjected to
income taxes $47,314 of earnings that had been previously sheltered due to the
availability of special tax-basis bad debt deductions. As a result, Wesco's 1992
net income was negatively impacted by an unusual increase in income tax expense
amounting to $17,500, or $2.46 per Wesco share (see Note 6).
 
     Effective January 1, 1993, Wesco adopted SFAS No. 109, "Accounting for
Income Taxes." One result was a $1,023 ($.14 per share) credit set forth
separately on the statement of income and retained earnings as the cumulative
effect of a change in accounting principle. Adoption of SFAS No. 109 resulted
also in increases in the provision for income taxes, and reductions in net
income, totaling $2,132 or $.30 per share (see Note 6).
 
                                       33
<PAGE>   22
 
     Another new accounting pronouncement, SFAS No. 115, "Accounting for Certain
Investments in Debt and Equity Securities," had a very significant impact on
Wesco's consolidated balance sheet when adopted at 1993 yearend. Marketable
equity securities of all Wesco entities -- not just its Wes-FIC insurance
subsidiary, as in the past -- were written up to market value rather than stated
at the lower of aggregate cost or market. The unrealized appreciation recorded
by the non-insurance entities, less deemed applicable income taxes, was credited
directly to shareholders' equity, which thereby increased $188,780 or $26.51 per
share (see Note 2).
 
     All material intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated in
the preparation of the accompanying consolidated financial statements.
 
NOTE 2.  INVESTMENTS
 
     Temporary cash investments consist of funds invested in money-market
accounts and other highly liquid investments maturing in less than three months
from date acquired.
 
     Management determines the appropriate classifications of investments in
securities with fixed maturities and marketable equity securities at the time of
purchase and reevaluates such designations as of each balance sheet date. There
are three permissible classifications: held-to-maturity; available-for-sale; and
trading. Securities are deemed to be held-to-maturity securities when both the
ability and the positive intent to hold them to maturity are present; they are
carried on the consolidated balance sheet at cost and adjusted for any accretion
of discount or amortization of premium using a method that produces
approximately level yield. Available-for-sale securities are carried at market
value, with unrealized gains and losses, net of deemed applicable income taxes,
reported in a separate component of shareholders' equity; there is no effect on
net income, except to reflect changes in income tax rates relating to such
unrealized gains and losses (see Note 6 re recording of rate changes in 1993).
Realized gains and losses on sales of investments, as determined on a specific
identification basis, are included in the consolidated statement of income and
retained earnings.
 
     As of December 31, 1993, all investments in securities with fixed
maturities were classified as held-to-maturity, and all marketable equity
securities were classified as available-for-sale. No investments were held for
trading purposes at that date.
 
     Following is a summary of temporary cash investments and securities with
fixed maturities, at yearend:

     Wesco adopted SFAS No. 115, "Accounting for Certain Investments in Debt and
Equity Securities," effective December 31, 1993. As a result, marketable equity
securities held by all Wesco entities at that date are stated at market value.
At prior yearends, only those held by Wes-FIC, Wesco's insurance subsidiary,
were stated at market value; all other marketable equity securities were stated
at the lower of aggregate cost or market. Adoption of SFAS No. 115 resulted in
an increase in Wesco's shareholders' equity of $188,780, or $26.51 per share.
 
     At 1993 yearend, the market value of marketable equity securities contained
$139 of unrealized losses. There were no unrealized losses at 1992 yearend.
 
NOTE 3. REAL ESTATE LOANS RECEIVABLE
 
     In October 1993, Mutual Savings sold substantially all of its real estate
loans to CenFed, subject to indemnification for most losses that CenFed might
sustain on their realization (see Note 1). Following is a summary of real estate
loans receivable by type of collateral, at yearend:

     Of the above loans, all of which were originated by Mutual Savings in
Southern California, $1,782 and $71,166 at 1993 and 1992 yearends bore
adjustable rates of interest. Estimated fair market values of the real estate
loan portfolios as of 1993 and 1992 yearends, based on market factors, were
approximately equal to their cost. Loans receivable are stated in the
accompanying consolidated balance sheet at unpaid principal balance, less any
writedowns and valuation allowances.
 
     Mutual Savings has indemnified CenFed against most losses that it might
sustain on the realization of the loans (see Note 1).
 
NOTE 4. REAL ESTATE HELD FOR SALE
 
     Real estate held for sale consists principally of Mutual Savings' cost of
developing a 22-acre parcel of largely oceanfront foreclosed land in Santa
Barbara, California, which it transferred to MS Property Company late in 1993.
The increase in net book value of the project from $20,604 at 1992 yearend to
$23,238 one year later reflects mainly continued construction of townhouses on a
large portion of the development, less a $2,000 writedown of the development to
estimated net realizable value.

     The remaining $6,697 of real estate held for sale as of 1993 yearend
represents principally six houses obtained by Mutual Savings through foreclosure
and four delinquent real estate loans that were subsequently foreclosed upon or
are likely to result in foreclosure.
 
     Real estate held for sale is stated in the accompanying consolidated
balance sheet at cost, less any writedowns and valuation allowances.
 
NOTE 5. SAVINGS ACCOUNTS
 
     In October 1993, Mutual Savings transferred all of its remaining savings
account liabilities aggregating $219,761 to CenFed (see Note 1). The savings
account liabilities comprised time certificates of deposit, and
money-market-rate, passbook and interest-bearing checking accounts. The
aggregate balances of $250,612 at 1992 yearend bore a weighted average annual
interest rate of 3.88%.
 
     Estimated 1992 yearend fair market value of the savings accounts, based on
market factors, was approximately equal to their book value.

</TABLE>
 
     Effective January 1, 1993, Wesco adopted SFAS No. 109, "Accounting for
Income Taxes." This statement requires that income taxes be calculated under the
asset and liability method, rather than the deferred method used in prior years.
Under the deferred method, differences between financial reporting and
tax-return reporting in the timing of revenues and expenses were multiplied by
tax rates then in effect, and the resulting taxes or benefits were deferred on
the financial statements as income taxes payable or prepaid income taxes; the
financial statements were not adjusted subsequently to reflect changes in tax
rates. Under the asset and liability method, balances of revenue and expense
timing differences at a balance sheet date (i.e., amounts of these temporary
differences that will disappear in the future) are multiplied by the tax rates
in effect at the balance sheet date, with the results deferred on the financial
statements as net deferred tax liabilities or assets; thus, under this method
the financial statements are automatically adjusted for changes in tax rates
when they occur.
 
     The cumulative effect of adopting SFAS No. 109 on Wesco's consolidated
financial statements caused a reduction in the liability for deferred income
taxes and an increase in after-tax income of $1,023 ($.14 per share) as of
January 1, 1993. This amount is reported on the accompanying consolidated
statement of income and retained earnings as the cumulative effect of a change
in accounting principle. Prior year financial statements have not been restated.
 
     In August 1993, the federal corporate tax rate was raised from 34% to 35%
retroactive to January 1, 1993. SFAS No. 109 requires that the entire effect of
a change in tax rate be recognized in the determination of net income in the
period enacted. Accordingly, Wesco's tax provision and, thus, net income for the
current year include not only the relatively minor effect of the one-percentage-
point increase in the federal rate on 1993 pre-tax income, but also charges for
the effect of the rate increase on two deferred tax liabilities that originated
in prior years: (1) $1,632 associated with unrealized appreciation of marketable
equity securities of Wes-FIC (notwithstanding that the gains, themselves, have
not yet figured in the determination of consolidated net income); and (2) $500
associated with the recapture of Mutual Savings' special bad debt tax deductions
(see below).

     Wesco's 1992 net income was negatively impacted by an unusual $17,500
increase in income tax expense resulting from Mutual Savings' decision in late
1992 to give up its status as a regulated savings and loan association. The tax
provision related to $47,314 of undistributed retained earnings of Mutual
Savings that had not been taxed due to the availability of special bad debt tax
deductions to savings and loan associations. These deductions were not related
to amounts of losses actually anticipated and were not charged against income
for financial reporting purposes; if the association ceased to qualify as a
regulated savings and loan association, such action would necessitate accrual
and payment of income taxes. The tax liability is expected to be paid over
several future years beginning with 1994.

     Wesco and its subsidiaries join with other Berkshire subsidiaries in the
filing of consolidated federal income tax returns for the Berkshire group. The
consolidated federal tax liability is apportioned among group members pursuant
to methods that result in each member of the group paying or receiving an amount
that approximates the increase or decrease in consolidated taxes attributable to
that member.
 
     Federal income tax returns through 1988 have been examined by and settled
with the Internal Revenue Service. A previously reported disagreement with the
California Franchise Tax Board with respect to state issues affecting years 1980
through 1987 is expected to be settled shortly without significant effect on
Wesco's consolidated financial statements.

     Agreements relating to the 8 7/8% notes contain covenants, among others,
enabling the lenders to require Wesco to redeem the notes at par in the event
Wesco ceases to be controlled by Berkshire. Wesco is in compliance with all of
the covenants.
 
     Estimated fair market values of the foregoing notes payable at December 31,
1993 and 1992, were approximately $43,200 and $59,200, respectively. These
figures were computed using discounted cash flow computations based upon
estimates as to prevailing interest rates on comparable borrowings.
