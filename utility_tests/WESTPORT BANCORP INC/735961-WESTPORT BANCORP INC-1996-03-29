PART I
Item 1
Business
- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------



General
Westport  Bancorp,  Inc.  ("Bancorp")  was  organized  in  1983  as  a  Delaware
corporation for the purpose of becoming the holding company of The Westport Bank
&   Trust   Company   (the   "Bank")    (collectively,    the   "Company"),    a
Connecticut-chartered   bank  and  trust  company   headquartered  in  Westport,
Connecticut,  the deposit  accounts  of which are insured by the Bank  Insurance
Fund of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation ("FDIC"). Bancorp is regulated
and examined by the Federal Reserve Board. The Bank is regulated by the FDIC and
the Banking Commissioner of the State of Connecticut (the "Commissioner").

Bancorp's  principal asset is all of the capital stock of the Bank and Bancorp's
principal  business  is the  business of the Bank.  Bancorp is a separate  legal
entity from the Bank; the principal sources of its revenues on an unconsolidated
basis are interest and other income  received  from its  investments,  including
dividends from the Bank.

The Bank was originally  chartered in 1852. Bancorp acquired the Bank on October
9, 1984.

The principal  business of the Bank is to provide a broad range of corporate and
individual  banking  products  and  services,   including   commercial  banking,
residential  mortgage  origination,  commercial lending,  commercial real estate
lending,  retail banking and trust services to individuals,  and small to medium
size  businesses.  The Bank's  operations  are conducted from its home office in
Westport,  Connecticut  and from  branch  offices  located in the  mid-Fairfield
County, Connecticut communities of Weston, Fairfield, Redding/Georgetown, Greens
Farms and Saugatuck.  In addition,  the Bank's  operations  center is located in
Shelton, Connecticut.


Principal Market Area
The Bank's  branch office  network  currently  consists of six banking  offices,
including its main office.  The towns in the Bank's market area,  which consists
principally of Fairfield County, Connecticut,  are primarily bedroom communities
of New York City,  although  Stamford,  Bridgeport  and Norwalk  are  commercial
centers. Two major highways (Interstate 95 and the Merritt Parkway) traverse the
area and a number of regional  airports  are located  within  Fairfield  County.
Those towns bordering I-95 have had substantial  commercial office  development,
particularly  near  the  major  highway  intersections.   This  market  is  also
accessible by railway.


Lending Activities
The Bank's principal lending  activities include the origination of conventional
and  construction  mortgage  loans  on  residential,   one-to-four  family  real
properties, as well as commercial and real estate loans to businesses.  The Bank
also  provides   consumer  loans,   which  include  home  equity  credit  lines,
installment loans (such as home improvement,  automobile and personal loans) and
checking account related loans. See Item 6 of this Form 10-K.


                                        2

Residential  Mortgage Loans.  While the Bank is authorized to make loans secured
by real estate  located either within or outside the State of  Connecticut,  its
past and present policy is to concentrate on loans secured by properties located
within Connecticut, particularly in Fairfield County. Less than 2% of the Bank's
total  residential  real estate loan portfolio at December 31, 1995  represented
loans on properties located outside the State of Connecticut.

The Bank currently offers  adjustable and fixed rate mortgages,  the majority of
which are  originated  to conform  with the  existing  criteria  for sale in the
secondary mortgage market.  Points are generally charged on residential mortgage
loans.  Interest  rate  adjustments  on  adjustable  rate  loans  are  generally
determined by reference to rates on one-year Treasury  obligations  published by
the Federal Reserve Board.


Commercial Mortgage Loans. The Bank's commercial mortgage investments consist of
loans made on commercial property and multi-family homes (more than four units).
In  general,  the Bank lends up to 75% of the  appraised  value of a  commercial
property.  Status reports on all  commercial  mortgage loans are reviewed by the
Bank's  Management  Loan  Committee and  Directors'  Loan Committee on a regular
basis.  Given the general  economic  downturn and the dramatic decline since the
late  1980's  in real  estate  values  in New  England,  and in  Connecticut  in
particular,  real estate  development and construction  within the Bank's market
area has  dramatically  declined  over the past several  years.  During 1995 and
1994,  this trend  showed signs of  stabilizing  and the Bank  experienced  some
increased demand for commercial mortgage loans.


Commercial  Loans. The Bank has been engaged in commercial  lending activity for
more than fifty  years.  Term loans to finance  machinery,  equipment or vehicle
purchases,  short  term  loans  for  working  capital  needs,  revolving  credit
supported  by  accounts  receivable  and/or  inventory,  and lines of credit are
representative of these types of loans in the Bank's portfolio.  These loans are
generally  secured by collateral other than real property;  less than 11% of the
Bank's commercial loan portfolio at December 31, 1995 was unsecured.


Home Equity  Loans.  Home  equity  loans  consist of lines of credit,  which are
collateralized  by first or second mortgages on residential  one-to-four  family
real properties.


Consumer Loans.  Consumer loans consist  primarily of installment  loans,  which
include home improvement  loans,  automobile loans,  personal loans and checking
account overdraft protection related loans.


FDIC Loans.  In the fourth quarter of 1992, the Bank purchased  $18.8 million in
performing  commercial  business  loans from the FDIC,  of which  $12.6  million
consisted of loans to businesses  located in the Bank's  primary  market area of
Fairfield  County,  with  $6.2  million  in  the  area  immediately  surrounding
Westport. The loans were acquired at par value; the purchase



                                        3


<PAGE>




was funded from existing  liquidity.  The purchase  agreement  contained a three
year provision (the "put"),  which ended on December 7, 1995,  that required the
FDIC  to  repurchase  any  loans  that  became  nonperforming,  at a  previously
negotiated  price plus sixty days of accrued  interest.  Losses  resulting  from
repurchases  during the three year  period  have been  minimal due to the loans'
performing  status. At December 7, 1995, the outstanding  balance of these loans
retained by the Bank was $4.3 million.


Interest Rates.  Interest rates charged on loans are primarily determined by the
Bank's cost of funds,  comparable investment  alternatives available to the Bank
and competitive conditions.


Loan  Commitments.  Commitments to extend commercial lines of credit and to make
mortgage loans on residential  and commercial real property are made for periods
of up to 60  days  from  the  date of  commitment.  Commitments  on  residential
transactions  are generally made at the market  interest rate  prevailing at the
time  the  commitment  is  made  to  the  customer.  Commitments  on  commercial
transactions  are  generally  made at the market  interest  rate in effect on or
immediately prior to the date of closing.


Deposits and Other Sources of Funds
Deposits  have   traditionally  been  the  Bank's  major  source  of  funds  for
investments  and lending and are  expected to continue to be in the  foreseeable
future. The Bank also derives funds from scheduled loan principal payments,  the
sale of residential  mortgage loans in the secondary  market,  loan prepayments,
the sale or maturity of investment  securities,  interest income and fee income.
Other sources of funds  include the sale of investment  securities to securities
firms and correspondent  banks under repurchase  agreements,  unsecured lines of
credit with  correspondent  banks and  secured  lines of credit with the Federal
Home Loan Bank. See Item 6 of this Form 10-K.


Deposits. The Bank offers a wide range of retail and commercial deposit accounts
designed  to attract  both  short and  long-term  funds.  It has been the Bank's
policy to offer a variety  of rates and types of  deposit  accounts  to meet its
customers'  requirements.  Demand  deposits,  certificates  of deposit,  regular
savings,  money market deposits and NOW checking  accounts have been the primary
source of deposit funds.  Certificates of deposit  currently offered by the Bank
have maturities which range from seven days to five years.

The Bank encounters  competition for deposits from other  community  banks,  the
branch offices of larger commercial banks and thrift institutions. The Bank also
competes for  interest-bearing  funds with  securities  firms,  mutual funds and
issuers of commercial paper and other  securities.  Bank management  anticipates
that  competition  for  deposits  in the Bank's  market  area will  continue  to
increase in the foreseeable  future due to competition  from  securities  firms,
mutual  funds,  and as other banks  enter the Bank's  market area as a result of
changes in the interstate banking law.

Trust Operations
At December  31,  1995,  the Bank's Trust  department  held,  for the account of
others,  assets under trust management and in custodial accounts having a market
value of $548.5 million.  As allowed by state law, the Bank acts as executor and
administrator of decedents'  estates, as trustee of inter-vivos and testamentary
trusts, as guardian and conservator of estates of minors and incapable  persons,
as custodian of funds, as investment  advisor and as trustee of employee benefit
plans. From its trust and related activities, the Bank generates substantial fee
income. In the trust business,  the Bank competes with commercial banks, located
both in and out of state,  and with  individuals  and entities  appointed to act
under testamentary and other instruments as fiduciaries, investment managers and
financial advisors. See Item 6 of this Form 10-K.


Employees
At December 31, 1995, the Bank had a total of 133 employees,  105 on a full-time
basis and 28 on a part-time  basis.  Management  considers the Bank's  relations
with its employees to be good. The Bank's  employees are not  represented by any
collective bargaining group.


Competition
Competition  in the  financial  services  industry in the Bank's  market area is
strong.  Numerous  commercial  banks,  savings  banks  and  thrift  institutions
maintain  home offices in the area and banks  headquartered  elsewhere  maintain
offices in the area.  Commercial  banks,  savings  banks,  thrift  institutions,
mutual funds,  mortgage brokers,  finance  companies,  credit unions,  insurance
companies,  securities  firms  and  private  lenders  compete  with the Bank for
deposits,  loans  and  employees.  Many of these  competitors  have far  greater
resources  than the Bank does and are able to conduct more intensive and broader
based promotional efforts to reach both commercial and individual customers.

Changes in the financial services industry  resulting from fluctuating  interest
rates,  technological  changes  and  deregulation  have  resulted  in  increased
competition,  merger activity,  failures among banking institutions and customer
awareness of product and service differences among competitors.


Regulation and Supervision
As a  Connecticut-chartered  state bank whose  deposits are insured by the FDIC,
the  Bank is  subject  to  extensive  regulation  and  supervision  by both  the
Commissioner  and the FDIC. The Bank is also subject to various  Federal Reserve
Board regulatory requirements applicable to FDIC insured financial institutions.
As a bank holding  company,  Bancorp is regulated by the Federal  Reserve Board.
Such   governmental   regulation   is  intended  to  protect   depositors,   not
stockholders.




                                        5

Connecticut  Regulation.  As a  state-chartered  capital stock bank, the Bank is
subject to the  applicable  provisions of  Connecticut  law and the  regulations
adopted thereunder by the Commissioner. The Commissioner administers Connecticut
banking  laws,  which contain  comprehensive  provisions  for the  regulation of
banks.  The Bank derives its lending and investment  powers from these laws, and
is subject to periodic examination by, and reporting to, the Commissioner.

Connecticut  bank and trust  companies  are  empowered  by  statute,  subject to
limitations  expressed  therein,  to accept savings and time deposits,  to offer
checking accounts,  to pay interest on such deposits and accounts, to make loans
on residential and other real estate,  to make consumer and commercial loans, to
invest, with certain  limitations,  in equity securities and debt obligations of
banks and  corporations,  to issue  credit  cards,  and to offer  various  other
banking services to their customers.  Connecticut banking laws grant banks broad
lending  authority.  Such  authority is limited,  however,  to the extent that a
bank's loans to any one obligor may not exceed 25%, if fully  secured,  and 15%,
if not fully  secured,  of the total of a bank's  equity  capital  and loan loss
reserves.

The  Connecticut  Interstate  Banking  Act  permits  Connecticut  banks and bank
holding  companies,  with the approval of the  Commissioner,  to engage in stock
acquisitions of banks and bank holding companies in other states with reciprocal
legislation.  Many states have such legislation.  Before the Interstate  Banking
Act was adopted in March 1990, Connecticut banks and bank holding companies were
allowed to engage in stock acquisitions with banks and bank holding companies in
other New England  states with  reciprocal  legislation,  all of which have such
legislation. See "Recent Developments" for a discussion of recent changes to the
regulations relating to interstate banking and branching.

Several interstate mergers involving large Connecticut banks with offices in the
Bank's  service area and banks  headquartered  out-of-state  have been completed
during recent years, resulting in increased competition for the Bank. A New York
based institution  acquired two failed  institutions from the FDIC in the Bank's
market area in 1991 and a New Jersey based  institution  acquired  another bank,
headquartered in the Bank's  principal  market,  in 1993.  During 1995 and early
1996,  two of the largest  commercial  banks in the Bank's market area completed
their  merger,  while  numerous  smaller  institutions  were  acquired by larger
in-state and out-of-state financial institutions.

The Bank is prohibited by Connecticut  banking law from paying  dividends except
from its net profits,  which are defined as the  remainder of all earnings  from
current  operations.  The  total of all  dividends  declared  by the Bank in any
calendar year may not, unless specifically approved by the Commissioner,  exceed
the  total of its net  profits  for that year  combined  with its  retained  net
profits from the preceding two years. These dividend  limitations can affect the
amount of dividends  payable to Bancorp as the sole stockholder of the Bank, and
therefore  affect  Bancorp's  payment of dividends to its  stockholders.  During
1995, Bancorp resumed the payment of dividends after all regulatory restrictions
were removed.

Under Connecticut banking law, no person may acquire the beneficial ownership of
more than 10% of any class of voting securities of a bank chartered by the State
of Connecticut  or having its principal  office in Connecticut or a bank holding
company thereof, unless the Commissioner approves such acquisition.


                                        6

Any state-chartered  bank meeting statutory  requirements may, with the approval
of the Commissioner,  establish and operate branches in any town or towns within
the state.

During January 1996,  representatives  of the  Commissioner  completed a routine
examination of the Bank as of October 30, 1995. Other than minor suggestions for
improvements,  there were no significant examination findings which are believed
to have potentially negative implications for the Bank.

FDIC  Regulation.  The  deposit  accounts  of the Bank are  insured  by the Bank
Insurance Fund of the FDIC to a maximum of $100,000 for each insured  depositor.
As an insured bank,  the Bank is subject to supervision  and  examination by the
FDIC and to FDIC regulations  regarding many aspects of its business,  including
types of deposit  instruments  offered,  permissible  methods for acquisition of
funds,  and activities of  subsidiaries  and affiliates.  The FDIC  periodically
examines insured institutions.

In December  1991, the Federal  Deposit  Insurance Act ("FDIA") was amended with
the enactment of the Federal Deposit  Insurance  Corporation  Improvement Act of
1991  ("FDICIA").  Provisions  of FDIA,  as  amended,  which may have a material
effect on the Bank and Bancorp include, among others, the following:

    1. FDIA  classifies  banks in one of five  categories  according  to capital
levels. With respect to banks not meeting prescribed minimum capital levels, and
depending  on the  extent  to  which a bank is  undercapitalized,  federal  bank
regulators may be required, in certain cases, to take corrective actions against
the bank,  including requiring an acceptable capital restoration plan or placing
a bank into conservatorship or receivership. In addition, undercapitalized banks
may be subject to  certain  restrictions  on their  activities  and  operations,
including  restrictions  on asset  growth,  rates of interest  paid on deposits,
transactions  with  affiliates,  engaging  in material  transactions  not in the
ordinary  course of  business,  and other  activities.  See  "Prompt  Corrective
Action" below.

    2. FDIA makes it more difficult for  undercapitalized  banks to borrow funds
from  the  Federal  Reserve's  "discount  window",  thus  possibly  limiting  or
eliminating  a source of  liquidity  for a bank.  The Bank is approved to borrow
funds from the "discount window".

    3. FDIA can result in higher  deposit  insurance  premiums for banks under a
"risk-based" premium  determination,  with possible negative effects on a bank's
operating results and financial condition.

    4. FDIA limits, with certain  exceptions,  the ability of banks to engage in
activities  or make equity  investments  that are not  permissible  for national
banks.

In addition,  the FDIC has issued  regulations  providing for capital guidelines
based upon the ratio of a bank's  capital  to total  assets  adjusted  for risk.
Under such  regulations,  a bank's  risk-based  capital  ratio is  calculated by
dividing its qualifying total capital base by its  risk-weighted  assets.  Banks
are  expected to meet a minimum Tier 1 capital to  risk-weighted  asset ratio of
4.00% and a total capital to risk-weighted asset ratio of 8.00%. At December 31,
1995,  Bancorp's Tier 1 capital to risk-weighted asset ratio was 12.77%, and its
total capital to  risk-weighted  asset ratio was 14.02%,  well above the minimum
requirements.  There are no significant  differences  between  Bancorp's and the
Bank's capital ratios at December 31, 1995.

                                        7

<PAGE>



Prompt  Corrective  Action.  Pursuant to the FDIA, the federal banking  agencies
established for each capital  measure levels at which an insured  institution is
deemed  to  be  well  capitalized,  adequately  capitalized,   undercapitalized,
significantly undercapitalized and critically undercapitalized.  Federal banking
agencies are required to take prompt  corrective  action with respect to insured
institutions that fall below minimum capital  standards.  The degree of required
regulatory  intervention  for  institutions  that  are not at  least  adequately
capitalized  is  tied  to  an  insured  institution's  capital  category,   with
increasing scrutiny and more stringent  restrictions,  including the appointment
of a receiver,  being imposed as an institution's  capital declines.  An insured
institution that falls below the minimum capital standards must submit a capital
restoration plan and could be subject to operating restrictions.

The  prompt   corrective   action   regulations  are  generally  based  upon  an
institution's  capital ratios.  Under the prompt  corrective  action  regulation
adopted by the FDIC, a bank will be considered to be (i)  "well-capitalized"  if
the institution has a total risk-based capital ratio of 10% or greater, a Tier 1
or core capital to risk-weighted  assets ratio of 6% or greater,  and a leverage
ratio of 5% or  greater  (provided  that the  institution  is not  subject to an
order,  written  agreement,   capital  directive  or  prompt  corrective  action
directive  to meet  and  maintain  a  specific  capital  level  for any  capital
measure);  (ii)  "adequately   capitalized"  if  the  institution  has  a  total
risk-based  capital  ratio  of 8% or  greater,  a  Tier  1 or  core  capital  to
risk-weighted  assets  ratio of 4% or  greater,  and a  leverage  ratio of 4% or
greater (3% or greater if the  institution is rated  composite 1 under the CAMEL
rating   system   in   its   most   recent   report   of   examination);   (iii)
"undercapitalized"  if the institution has a total risk-based capital ratio that
is less than 8%, a Tier 1 or core capital to risk-weighted  assets ratio of less
than 4%, or a  leverage  ratio  that is less than 4% (3% if the  institution  is
rated  composite 1 under the CAMEL  rating  system in its most recent  report of
examination);  (iv)  "significantly  undercapitalized"  if the institution has a
total risk-based capital ratio that is less than 6%, a Tier 1 or core capital to
risk-weighted  assets  ratio that is less than 3%, or a  leverage  ratio that is
less than 3%; and (v)  "critically  undercapitalized"  if the  institution has a
ratio of tangible  equity to total  assets that is less than or equal to 2%. The
prompt  corrective  action  regulations also permit the FDIC to determine that a
bank  institution  should  be  classified  in a lower  category  based  on other
information, such as the institution's examination report, after written notice.
Under the FDIC's prompt corrective action regulations, at December 31, 1995, the
Bank was classified as well-capitalized based on its capital ratios.

An  institution  that  is not  well-capitalized  is  prohibited  from  accepting
deposits  through  a  deposit  broker.   However,   an  adequately   capitalized
institution  can apply for a waiver to accept  brokered  deposits.  Institutions
that  receive a waiver are subject to limits on the rates of  interest  they may
pay on brokered  deposits.  Undercapitalized  institutions  are prohibited  from
offering  rates of interest on insured  deposits that  significantly  exceed the
prevailing  rate in their  normal  market area or the area in which the deposits
would otherwise be accepted.  Institutions  classified as  undercapitalized  are
precluded  from  increasing   their  assets,   acquiring   other   institutions,
establishing  additional branches,  or engaging in new lines of business without
an  approved  capital  plan and an agency  determination  that such  actions are
consistent with the plan.  Institutions that are significantly  undercapitalized
may be  required  to take  one or  more  of the  following  actions:  (i)  raise
additional capital so that the institution will be adequately capitalized;  (ii)
be acquired  by, or combined  with,  another  institution  if grounds  exist for
appointing a receiver; (iii) refrain from affiliate transactions; (iv) limit the
amount of interest paid on deposits to the  prevailing  rates of interest in the
region where the institution is located; (v) further restrict asset growth; (vi)
hold a new election for directors, dismiss any director or senior executive

                                        8

<PAGE>

officer  who  held  office  for  more  than  180  days  immediately  before  the
institution  became  undercapitalized,  or  employ  qualified  senior  executive
officers;   (vii)  stop  accepting   deposits  from   correspondent   depository
institutions;  and  (viii)  divest or  liquidate  any  subsidiary  that the FDIC
determines is a significant risk to the institution. Critically undercapitalized
institutions are subject to additional restrictions.

Any company that controls an "undercapitalized" institution, must guarantee that
the institution will comply with the plan and provide appropriate  assurances of
performance in connection with the submission of a capital  restoration  plan by
the  depository  institution.  The aggregate  liability of any such  controlling
company  under  such  guaranty  is  limited  to  the  lesser  of  (i)  5% of the
institution's assets at the time it became undercapitalized;  or (ii) the amount
necessary  to bring the  institution  into  capital  compliance  at the time the
institution fails to comply with the terms of its capital plan. If the Bank were
to become "undercapitalized", Bancorp would be required to guarantee performance
of any capital  restoration  plan  submitted as a condition to FDIC  approval of
that plan pursuant to the FDIA.

Safety and Soundness  Guidelines.  The federal banking  agencies have prescribed
safety and soundness  guidelines relating to (i) internal controls,  information
systems,  and internal  audit  systems;  (ii) loan  documentation;  (iii) credit
underwriting;   (iv)  interest  rate  exposure;   (v)  asset  growth;  and  (vi)
compensation  and benefit  standards  for  officers,  directors,  employees  and
principal   shareholders.   Such  guidelines  impose  standards  based  upon  an
institution's asset quality and earnings. The guidelines are intended to set out
standards  that the  agencies  will use to  identify  and  address  problems  at
institutions  before  capital  becomes  impaired.  Institutions  are required to
establish  and  maintain  a  system  to  identify  problem  assets  and  prevent
deterioration  of those  assets in a manner  commensurate  with its size and the
nature and scope of their operations.  Furthermore,  institutions must establish
and maintain a system to evaluate and monitor  earnings and ensure that earnings
are  sufficient  to  maintain   adequate   capital  and  reserves  in  a  manner
commensurate with their size and the nature and scope of its operation.

Under the  guidelines,  an institution not meeting one or more of the safety and
soundness  guidelines is required to file a compliance plan with the appropriate
federal banking agency. In the event that an institution, such as the Bank, were
to fail to submit an acceptable  compliance plan or fail in any material respect
to implement an accepted  compliance plan within the time allowed by the agency,
the institution  would be required to correct the deficiency and the appropriate
federal agency would be authorized  to: (1) restrict  asset growth;  (2) require
the institution to increase its ratio of tangible equity to assets; (3) restrict
the rates of interest that the institution may pay; or (4) take any other action
that would better carry out the purpose of the corrective  action.  The Bank was
in compliance with all such guidelines as of December 31, 1995.

Community Reinvestment Act. Under the Community Reinvestment Act (the "CRA") and
the implementing FDIC  regulations,  which were amended in 1995 to provide for a
performance-based  evaluation  system, the Bank has a continuing and affirmative
obligation to help meet the credit needs of its local communities, including low
and moderate-income neighborhoods,  consistent with the safe and sound operation
of the Bank.  The CRA  requires  that the Board of Directors of the Bank adopt a
CRA statement for each assessment area that,  among other things,  describes its
efforts to help meet  community  credit needs and the  specific  types of credit
that the  institution  is willing to extend.  The FDIC and the  Federal  Reserve
Board are required to take


                                        9

<PAGE>

into account the Bank's  record of meeting the credit needs of its  community in
determining  whether  to  grant  approval  for  certain  types  of  applications
including mergers and acquisitions.

Under CRA, the federal banking agencies  established the following ratings:  (i)
"outstanding"  - an institution in this group has an outstanding  record of, and
is a leader in,  ascertaining and helping to meet the credit needs of its entire
delineated  community,  including low and moderate  income  neighborhoods,  in a
manner consistent with its resources and capabilities,  (ii) "satisfactory" - an
institution has a satisfactory  record of  ascertaining  and helping to meet the
credit  needs of its entire  delineated  community  including  low and  moderate
income neighborhoods, in a manner consistent with its resources, (iii) "needs to
improve" - an  institution  in this group needs to improve its overall record of
ascertaining  and  helping  to meet the credit  needs of its  entire  delineated
community,  including  low  and  moderate  income  neighborhoods,  in  a  manner
consistent  with  its  resources,  and  (iv)  "substantial  noncompliance"  - an
institution in this group has a substantially  deficient  record of ascertaining
and  helping  to meet the  credit  needs  of its  entire  delineated  community,
including low and moderate income neighborhoods, in a manner consistent with its
resources and capabilities. The Bank's current CRA rating is satisfactory.

Federal Reserve System. Pursuant to the Depository Institutions Deregulation and
Monetary Control Act of 1980 (the "Deregulation Act"), the Federal Reserve Board
adopted  regulations  that  require  the Bank to maintain  reserves  against its
transaction accounts and non-personal time deposits. At December 31, 1995, these
regulations  generally  require that reserves of 3% be maintained  for aggregate
transaction  accounts  of up to  $52.0  million  and  that  reserves  of  10% be
maintained against the portion of transaction accounts in excess of that amount.

The  Deregulation  Act also gives the Bank  authority to borrow from the Federal
Reserve Bank's "discount window".

The Federal Reserve Board has established  capital adequacy  guidelines for bank
holding companies that are similar to those required by the FDICIA. Bank holding
companies are currently required to comply with the FDICIA's  risk-based capital
and minimum leverage capital requirements.

Bancorp is subject to  regulation  by the Federal  Reserve Board as a registered
bank  holding  company.  The Bank Holding  Company Act of 1956,  as amended (the
"BHCA"), under which Bancorp is registered,  limits the types of companies which
Bancorp  may  acquire or  organize  and the  activities  in which it or they may
engage.  In general,  Bancorp and its  subsidiaries are prohibited from engaging
in,  or  acquiring  direct  control  of  any  company  engaged  in,  non-banking
activities  unless such activities are so closely related to banking or managing
or controlling banks as to be a proper incident thereto.  At this time,  Bancorp
has not  determined  which,  if any, of these or other  permissible  non-banking
activities it might seek to engage in.

Under BHCA,  Bancorp is required to obtain the prior  approval  from the Federal
Reserve  Board  to  acquire,  with  certain  exceptions,  more  than  5% of  the
outstanding voting stock of any bank or bank holding company,  to acquire all or
substantially  all of the  assets  of a bank or to  merge  or  consolidate  with
another bank holding company.

Under BHCA,  Bancorp and the Bank and any other subsidiaries are prohibited from
engaging  in certain  tying  arrangements  among  Bancorp  and its  subsidiaries
relating to any extension of

                                       10

<PAGE>

credit or provision of any  property or services to third  parties.  The Federal
Reserve  Board  relaxed  some of these  restrictions  in 1994.  The Bank is also
subject  to  certain  restrictions  imposed  by the  Federal  Reserve  Board  on
extending credit to Bancorp or any of its subsidiaries, or on making investments
in the stock or  securities  thereof,  and on taking such stock or securities as
collateral for loans to any borrower.

Bancorp is required under BHCA to file annually with the Federal Reserve Board a
report on its operations.  Bancorp and the Bank and any other  subsidiaries  are
subject to examination by the Federal Reserve Board.

Pursuant to the Change in Bank Control Act of 1978, as amended,  any person must
give 60 days notice to the Federal Reserve Board prior to acquiring control of a
bank holding company such as Bancorp.  Control is defined as ownership of 25% of
any class of voting stock of a bank holding company,  or the power to direct the
management  or policies of the bank holding  company.  Control is presumed  upon
ownership  of 10% or more of any class of voting  stock if (i) the bank  holding
company's  shares  are  registered  pursuant  to  Section  12 of the  Securities
Exchange Act of 1934 as amended (as are Bancorp's  shares of Common  Stock),  or
(ii) the acquiring party would be the largest stockholder of the class of voting
stock of the bank  holding  company.  The  statute  and  underlying  regulations
authorize  the Federal  Reserve Board to  disapprove a proposed  transaction  on
certain specified grounds.

In addition to the Change in Bank  Control  Act,  prior  approval by the Federal
Reserve  Board is  required  under the BHCA for any  "company"  to become a bank
holding  company  and to become  subject to  regulation  as such by the  Federal
Reserve Board. A company may become a bank holding  company with Federal Reserve
Board  approval  if the company  controls a bank or a bank  holding  company.  A
"company" includes certain trusts, partnerships, corporations and other business
entities,  but does not include  individuals.  For purposes of BHCA,  control is
defined as (i) ownership,  control or the power to vote 25% or more of any class
of voting  securities of a bank or a bank holding  company;  (ii) control in any
manner  of the  election  of a  majority  of the  directors  of a bank or a bank
holding company; or (iii) direct or indirect exercise of a controlling influence
over  the  management  or  policies  of a bank  or a bank  holding  company,  as
determined by the Federal  Reserve  Board.  A company that is required to obtain
prior  approval  under BHCA to become a bank holding  company is exempt from the
prior approval requirement of the Change in Bank Control Act.


Recent  Developments.  In 1994,  Congress  enacted  the  Riegle-Neal  Interstate
Banking  and  Branching  Efficiency  Act,  which  will  remove  restrictions  on
interstate  branching and interstate bank  acquisitions.  In connection with the
Riegle-Neal  Act, the State of Connecticut has enacted  legislation that permits
merger transactions  between a Connecticut and an out-of-state bank beginning on
September  25, 1995.  Moreover,  restrictions  on interstate  branching  will be
removed effective on January 1, 1997.

Item 7
Management's Discussion and
Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations
- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------


Overview
The following is a discussion and analysis of the Company's  financial condition
at the end of 1995 and 1994 and of the  results of its  operations  for the last
three years.  This section should be read in conjunction  with the  consolidated
financial statements included in Item 8.

The  Company  reported  net income for 1995 of  $6,830,000,  or $0.65 per common
share,  fully  diluted,  as compared to net income of  $4,362,000,  or $0.44 per
common share,  primary, in 1994, an increase of 57.0%. In 1995, primary earnings
per share were $0.66. Contributing to the improved results in 1995 was a decline
in nonperforming assets and related costs,  increases in average earning assets,
an improved net interest margin and continued  reductions of operating expenses.
Results of operations  for 1995 included the  recognition  of a net deferred tax
asset of $1,122,000  and a net gain on the sale of securities and loans totaling
$58,000.  Earnings from core operations  (income before income taxes,  excluding
non-recurring  gains and losses) for 1995 have  increased  by more than 95% over
last year.  As a result of improved  operating  results,  the  Company's  Tier 1
capital  (leverage) ratio increased to 8.18% at December 31, 1995 as compared to
6.13% at December 31, 1994.

At December 31, 1995, the Company had total assets of $312,917,000,  an increase
of 10.4% from  $283,504,000  at the end of 1994.  Assets at  December  31,  1994
increased 4.0% from $272,657,000 at December 31, 1993.

Net income  for 1994 of  $4,362,000  increased  263% over net income for 1993 of
$1,202,000, or $0.12 per common share, primary. Contributing to improved results
in 1994 was a reduction in nonperforming  assets, an improvement in net interest
income and a reduction in the provision for loan losses.  In addition,  in 1994,
stronger fee income from trust fees, mortgage servicing fees and service charges
on deposit  accounts  contributed to the improved results over 1993. At December
31, 1994,  Bancorp's  Tier 1 Capital  (leverage)  ratio was 6.13% as compared to
4.84% at December 31, 1993.

The Company's results for 1995 continued to be impacted by the sluggish regional
economy and real estate market.  However,  during 1994 and continuing into 1995,
management has seen some positive trends,  including the increased stabilization
of the local economy,  reduction in vacancy rates,  and renewed  activity in the
real  estate  market,   which  have  had  a  positive  effect  on  earnings.   A
deterioration  of the economy and/or real estate values would  adversely  affect
results  in 1996  and  beyond,  and  could  lead  to  increased  levels  of loan
charge-offs,  the provision for loan losses and nonaccrual  loans and reductions
in income and total capital.

Regulation and Supervision
In December 1994, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (the "FDIC") and the
State of Connecticut Banking Commissioner (the "Commissioner") removed the Order
to Cease and Desist originally  imposed on the Bank in October 1991. This action
was the  result of a routine  examination  by the FDIC  completed  in the fourth
quarter of 1994.

                                       16

In March  1995,  the  Federal  Reserve  Bank of New York  ("FRBNY")  removed all
restrictions it had imposed on Bancorp in October 1991.

Bancorp resumed the payment of dividends in 1995 after these  regulatory  orders
were  removed.  There are  certain  restrictions  on the  ability of the Bank to
transfer funds to Bancorp in the form of dividends. See "Liquidity".

The Federal Reserve Board and the FDIC require bank holding companies and banks,
respectively, to comply with guidelines based upon the ratio of capital to total
assets  adjusted  for risk and the  ratio of Tier 1 capital  to total  quarterly
average assets (leverage ratio).

The following  summarizes the minimum capital requirements and Bancorp's capital
position (there are no significant  differences between the Bank's and Bancorp's

The Federal Deposit  Insurance Act, as amended by the Federal Deposit  Insurance
Corporation  Improvement Act of 1991 ("FDICIA") establishes five classifications
for banks on the basis of their capital  levels;  well  capitalized,  adequately
capitalized,  undercapitalized,  significantly  undercapitalized  and critically
undercapitalized. At December 31, 1995, the Company was "well capitalized" under
FDIA, based upon the above capital ratios.  Deterioration of economic conditions
and real  estate  values  could  adversely  affect  future  results,  leading to
increased levels of loan  charge-offs,  provision for loan losses and nonaccrual
loans,  affecting  the ability of the Company to maintain  the well  capitalized
classification, and resulting in reductions in income and total capital.


Financial Condition
The Company's  assets totaled  $312,917,000 at December 31, 1995, an increase of
$29,413,000,  or 10.4.%,  from $283,504,000 at December 31, 1994. Average assets
increased  5.9% during 1995 over the previous year.  Total  deposits  aggregated
$274,670,000 at December 31, 1995, an increase of $20,712,000, from $253,958,000
at December 31, 1994.

Noninterest-bearing  deposits  totaled  $78,421,000  at December  31,  1995,  an
increase  of   $5,449,000,   or  7.5%  from   $72,972,000   at  year  end  1994.
Interest-bearing  deposits  increased from  $180,986,000 at December 31, 1994 to
$196,249,000  at December 31, 1995,  or 8.4%.  For  municipalities  and selected
commercial and retail customers, the Bank also offers secured

borrowings  through  repurchase  agreements  which are  included  in  short-term
borrowings.  Securities  sold under  repurchase  agreements  were  $1,050,000 at
December 31, 1995 and $7,800,000 at December 31, 1994.

The Company's  entire  securities  portfolio of  $85,338,000  was  classified as
available for sale at December 31, 1995. At December 31, 1994, the available for
sale portfolio  totaled  $27,190,000 and the held to maturity  portfolio totaled
$43,206,000.  Securities  available for sale are carried at fair value, with any
unrealized  gains or losses  included as a separate  component of  stockholders'
equity. The portfolio at December 31, 1995 was comprised primarily of fixed rate
U.S. Government Agency debt and mortgage-backed securities.

During the fourth  quarter of 1995,  the Financial  Accounting  Standards  Board
provided  companies with the  opportunity to reclassify  securities  between the
available  for sale  portfolio and the held to maturity  portfolio.  The Company
took advantage of this opportunity and reclassified its entire  $42,459,000 held
to maturity portfolio to the available for sale portfolio.

Total loans  decreased by $8,596,000 or 4.6%, in 1995, to  $178,052,000,  net of
deferred  loan fees.  This decline was due, in part,  to the sale during 1995 of
$18.6 million in residential mortgage loans. The Bank engages in the origination
of  residential  mortgage  loans and the sale of such loans based upon liquidity
needs and to manage  interest rate risk. In addition,  the resolution of several
larger nonperforming commercial mortgage loans contributed to the decline in the
portfolio.  During 1995, the Bank concentrated its commercial lending efforts on
small and medium size businesses.

At December 31, 1995, the recorded  investment in loans for which impairment has
been recognized in accordance with SFAS 114 and 118 totaled $2,443,000, of which
$1,996,000 were nonaccrual loans. At December 31, 1995, the valuation  allowance
related to all impaired loans totaled  $634,000 and is included in the allowance
for loan losses.  For the year ended  December 31,  1995,  the average  recorded
investment in impaired loans was approximately  $5.2 million.  During 1995 total
interest in the amount of $95,000 was recognized on accruing impaired loans.

At December 31, 1995, impaired accruing loans included $.2 million of loans with
below  market  interest  rates.  At  December  31,  1995,  the  Company  had  no
commitments  to lend  additional  funds to  borrowers  with loans that have been
classified as impaired.  The level of nonperforming assets has had a significant
negative impact on the Company's  capital and earnings over the last five years.
Although management  recognizes that the level of nonperforming  assets is still
high, it is encouraged by the downward trend since 1990 and the 70% decline from
December 31, 1994 to December 31, 1995.

It is the  Company's  policy to  discontinue  the  accrual of interest on loans,
including impaired loans, when, in the opinion of management, a reasonable doubt
exists as to the timely collection of the amounts due. Additionally,  regulatory
requirements  generally  prohibit the accrual of interest on certain  loans when
principal or interest is due and remains unpaid for 90 days or more,  unless the
loan is both well secured and in the process of collection.

Operating  results  since  1989 have  been  adversely  impacted  by the level of
nonperforming  assets as a result of the deterioration of borrowers'  ability to
make scheduled interest and principal payments,  caused primarily by the decline
in real estate values, a severe slowdown in business activity and a high rate of
unemployment.  In addition to foregone revenue, the Company has had to provide a
high level of provision for loan losses and has incurred significant  collection
costs and costs  associated  with the management  and  disposition of foreclosed
properties.  However,  during 1994 and continuing into 1995, management has seen
some  positive  trends,  including  the  increased  stabilization  of the  local
economy,  reduction in vacancy  rates,  and renewed  activity in the real estate
market, which have had a positive effect on earnings.

The  characteristics  of the real estate market since 1989 include a substantial
decline in real estate property values and a significant  increase in the amount
of time that properties remain on the market prior to sale. Factors contributing
to the  depressed  market  conditions  are an over supply of  properties  on the
market and a continued sluggish local economy. As a result, the most significant
increases in  nonperforming  loans since 1989 have been in  commercial  mortgage
loans,  residential  mortgage  loans and real estate related  commercial  loans.
Management  has seen some recent  improvement  in the real estate market and the
local  economy,  which has had a  positive  effect  on its  efforts  to  resolve
nonperforming loans.  Management is aggressively  pursuing the collection of all
nonperforming  loans.  Management's  efforts  to return  nonperforming  loans to
performing status may be hampered by market factors.

Included in additions for 1995 are two loans  totaling  $1.2  million,  from one
borrower,  which were  substantially  resolved  in the  fourth  quarter of 1995.
Subsequent to December 31, 1995,  loans totaling $.4 million have been placed on
nonaccrual status.

In addition to the loans classified as nonperforming in the preceding table, the
Bank's internal loan review function has identified  approximately  $1.4 million
of  commercial  and  commercial  real estate loans with more than normal  credit
risk. While these loans, were performing  according to contractual  agreement at
December 31, 1995,  previous  payment  history  indicates the borrowers may have
difficulty  in  the  future  in  meeting  all of the  terms  of the  contractual
agreements. These loans, as well as nonperforming commercial and commercial real
estate  loans,  have been  considered  in the  analysis  of the  adequacy of the
allowance for loan losses.


Allowance for Loan Losses
Management  evaluates the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses on a regular
basis by  considering  various  factors,  including  past loan loss  experience,
delinquent  and  nonperforming  loans and the  quality  and level of  collateral
securing these loans, inherent risks in the loan portfolio, and current economic
and real estate market conditions.  Management has performed a loan-by-loan risk
assessment  of  each  classified  loan  and  of a  substantial  portion  of  the
performing commercial and commercial mortgage portfolios resulting in a specific
reserve based on loss exposure.  An additional general reserve is also allocated
to each of these  portfolios  as well as to the  residential  mortgage and other
loan  portfolios  on an overall  basis,  based upon the risk  category  and loss
experience of the given portfolio. Based upon this review, management





                                       22

<PAGE>


believes  that,  in the  aggregate,  the allowance of $2,854,000 at December 31,
1995 is adequate to absorb  probable loan losses inherent in the loan portfolio.
The adverse real estate market in Fairfield County,  the Company's past reliance
upon commercial real estate  lending,  the level of charge-offs  during the past
five years and the level of nonperforming loans are factors which are considered
when the  adequacy of the  allowance  for loan losses is  reviewed.  There is no
assurance  that  the  Company  will not be  required  to make  increases  to the
allowance  in  the  future  in  response  to  changing  economic  conditions  or
regulatory examinations.

The decrease in the  allowance  for loan losses from  $3,341,000 at December 31,
1994 to $2,854,000  at December 31, 1995  reflects the decline in  nonperforming
and nonaccruing loans and $2,366,000 of loan charge-offs  during the period. The
charge-offs  in 1995 primarily  relate to loans on which a specific  reserve had
been allocated at December 31, 1994 based on anticipated loss exposure.

It is the Company's  policy to  charge-off  loans against the allowance for loan
losses when losses are certain. Such decisions are based upon an analysis of the
loan,  a judgment  as to the  borrower's  ability to repay and the  adequacy  of
collateral.

The following tables summarize other selected loan and allowance for loan losses
information for 1995, 1994, 1993, 1992 and 1991.

As the volume of new loans increased and nonaccrual loans declined,  the overall
credit  quality of the total loan  portfolio has improved  which has  positively
impacted management's estimate of the allowance for loan losses.

The allowance for loan losses ratio for 1994,  1993 and 1992, as a percentage of
outstanding  loans,  shown on the  preceding  page,  is  impacted  by the  loans
purchased from the FDIC in late 1992. If these loans had not been included,  the
allowance-to-loans outstanding ratio would have been 1.87% at December 31, 1994,
2.07% at December 31, 1993 and 2.45% for December 31, 1992. At December 31, 1995
these loans were no longer subject to a repurchase agreement with the FDIC.

On January 1, 1995,  the  Company  adopted  Statement  of  Financial  Accounting
Standards No. 114 ("SFAS  114"),  "Accounting  by Creditors for  Impairment of a
Loan",  and  Statement of Financial  Accounting  Standards No. 118 ("SFAS 118"),
"Accounting  by Creditors  for  Impairment  of a Loan - Income  Recognition  and
Disclosures".  SFAS  114  and  118  address  the  accounting  by  creditors  for
impairment  of certain  loans and the  recognition  of interest  income on these
loans and  requires  that  impairment  of these loans be  measured  based on the
present value of expected future cash flows  discounted at the loan's  effective
interest rate or the fair value of  collateral.  A loan is considered  impaired,
based on current information and events, if it is probable that the Company will
be unable to collect the  scheduled  payments of principal and interest when due
according to the contractual  terms of the loan agreement.  The adoption of SFAS
114 and 118 on January 1, 1995 did not materially affect the Company's financial
statements or the amount of the allowance for loan losses.

Interest  payments  received on accruing impaired loans are recorded as interest
income.  Interest  payments  on  nonaccruing  impaired  loans  are  recorded  as
reductions of loan principal.

Management is aware of its  responsibility for maintaining an adequate allowance
for loan losses and an adequate  system to identify  credit risk and account for
it appropriately. The various recent regulatory examinations of the Company have
not identified  significant  problem loans not already identified by management.
Management will continue to review the findings of regulatory  examinations  and
comply with regulatory recommendations.

A  deterioration  of economic  conditions and real estate values could adversely
affect  future  results,  leading  to  increased  levels  of  loan  charge-offs,
provision  for loan losses and  nonaccrual  loans and  reductions  in income and
total capital.

Other Real Estate Owned
At December  31,  1995,  the Company had no other real estate  owned  properties
("OREO") in its possession.  At December 31, 1994, OREO totaled  $352,000.  OREO
properties  are carried at the lower of cost or  estimated  fair  value.  During
1995,  the Company  recorded  $171,000 of additional  write-downs on real estate
properties  and sold real estate  properties  with a carrying value of $270,000,
which resulted in a net gain of $52,000 during the 1995 period. During 1994, the
Company sold properties with a carrying value of $1,477,000  incurring losses of
$191,000,  a portion of which had been previously accrued.  In addition,  in the
first quarter of 1994,  the Company  transferred a commercial  office  building,
carried at $1.3 million,  from OREO to banking premises.  Subsequent to December
31, 1995 the Company has entered into a contract  for the sale of this  building
at an amount that  approximates book value. The sale is expected to be finalized
during the second  quarter of 1996.  During the third quarter of 1994,  the Bank
acquired two residential properties through foreclosure, carried at $561,000. No
properties were acquired through foreclosure or acquisition during 1995. Further
material  declines in the real estate market could cause  increases in the level
of OREO, further losses or write-downs.

The following table  summarizes the changes in OREO for the years ended December
31, 1995 and 1994.

Results of Operations

Overview

The  Company's  earnings  are largely  dependent  upon net  interest  income and
noninterest  income  from  its  community  banking  operations,  including  fees
generated by its Trust department. Net interest income is the difference between
interest  earned on the loan and  investment  portfolios  and  interest  paid on
deposits and other sources of funds.  Noninterest income is primarily the result
of fees  generated  by the Trust  department,  charges  related  to  transaction
activity from  commercial and retail  checking  accounts and gains from loan and
securities sales.

The  Company  reported  net  income for 1995 of  $6,830,000  or $0.65 per common
share, fully diluted, and $0.66 per common share, primary compared to net income
of $4,362,000 or $0.44 per common share,  primary, for 1994. Net income for 1995
included the recognition of additional deferred tax assets of $1,122,000 and net
gains on the sale of loans and  securities  amounting to $58,000.  Earnings from
core operations (income before income taxes,  excluding  non-recurring gains and
losses)  in 1995  amounted  to  $5,767,000.  By  contrast,  earnings  from  core
operations in 1994, amounted to $2,948,000.  As discussed below, the significant
improvement  in results for 1995 was  primarily  attributable  to a reduction in
nonperforming assets, an increase in the net interest margin due, in part, to an
increase in average  earning  assets and the yield  thereon,  a reduction in the
provision for loan losses as a result of the overall  improvement  in the credit
quality of the loan  portfolio  and the  control of  operating  expenses  as the
Company  continued to expand in 1995.  In addition,  stronger  income from trust
fees and a reduction in FDIC premiums contributed to improved 1995 earnings.

Negatively  impacting  earnings  for 1995 was an increase in  professional  fees
related to  strategic  planning  initiatives  and an increase  in  salaries  and
benefits due to the  implementation,  during 1995,  of a new bonus and incentive
program, along with revisions to executive benefit plans.

Net income  for 1994 of  $4,362,000  increased  263% over net income for 1993 of
$1,202,000, or $0.12 per common share, primary. Contributing to improved results
in 1994 was a reduction in nonperforming  assets, an improvement in net interest
income and a reduction in the provision for loan losses.  In addition,  in 1994,
stronger fee income from trust fees, mortgage servicing fees and service charges
on deposit  accounts  contributed to the improved results over 1993. At December
31, 1994,  Bancorp's  Tier 1 Capital  (leverage)  ratio was 6.13% as compared to
4.84% at December 31, 1993.

The past decline in the regional economy,  particularly in the local real estate
market,  has affected the ability of many of the Bank's borrowers to repay their
loans.  Also,  since 1989, real estate values in the Company's  market area have
declined   substantially.   While  the  Bank's   residential,   commercial   and
construction   mortgage   lending   policies  have   specified  a  75%  or  less
loan-to-value ratio, the decline in values has increased the possibility of loss
in the event of  default.  Management  believes  this  decline  has  abated  and
improvements were shown during 1994 and 1995.

Net Interest Income

Net interest income is the difference between interest earned on loans and other
investments  and  interest  paid on  deposits  and other  sources of funds.  Net
interest  income is affected by a number of variables.  One such variable is the
interest rate spread, which represents the difference between the yield on total
average    interest-earning    assets   and   the   cost   of   total    average
noninterest-bearing and interest-bearing liabilities.

During 1995,  the interest  rate spread  improved,  from 5.2% in 1994 to 5.7% in
1995,  primarily  due to the  increase in yields  earned on  accruing  loans and
investment  securities.  The yield on  interest-earning  assets  was  positively
impacted by a net  increase in the prime rate during  1995,  resulting in higher
yields on the Bank's  commercial loan portfolio and home equity  portfolio.  The
yield on investment  securities increased in 1995 due to sales of lower yielding
securities,  which  resulted in a net loss of $229,000,  and purchases of higher
yielding securities.

During 1994,  the interest  rate spread  improved to 5.2% as compared to 4.6% in
1993.  This  increase  was due  primarily  to the decline of  interest  costs on
deposit accounts and the increase in average  noninterest-bearing  deposits. The
yield on earning assets was positively impacted in 1994, as compared to 1993, by
an  increase  in the  prime  rate,  resulting  in higher  yields  on the  Bank's
commercial loan portfolio and home equity portfolio.

Net  interest   margin   represents  net  interest  income  divided  by  average
interest-earning  assets.  The continued high level of nonearning assets in 1993
and 1994 had a negative  impact on the net interest  margin  during those years.
However,  the decline in nonaccruing loans and other real estate owned favorably
impacted the net interest margin in 1994 and 1995.

The  following  table  sets  forth a three year  comparison  of average  earning
assets,  nonaccrual  loans,  average  interest-bearing  liabilities  and related
interest  income and expense.  Average  balances  are averages of daily  closing
balances,  except for nonaccrual  loans in 1993 and 1994,  which are averages of
monthly closing balances. Certain amounts have been reclassified to conform with
the 1995 presentation.

Net interest income was $14,698,000 in 1995,  compared with $12,585,000 in 1994,
an increase of $2,113,000 or 16.8%. Net interest income for 1994 increased 25.5%
over $10,025,000 in 1993. Contributing factors to the changes in interest income
and expense are discussed below.

Total interest income  amounted to $20,725,000 in 1995,  compared to $17,334,000
for 1994,  an  increase of  $3,391,000  or 19.6%.  A key factor  relating to the
higher level of total interest income for 1995,  compared to the prior year, was
an increase in average  interest-earning  assets of $13.7 million or 5.6%, which
positively  impacted  earnings  by  $1,254,000.  In  addition,  during this same
period,  the average yield on  interest-earning  assets  increased  from 7.1% to
8.0%, resulting in an increase in interest income of $2,137,000.  Total interest
income of  $17,334,000  in 1994  represented  an  increase  of 10.3%  over 1993.
Contributing to the improved  results in 1994 was an increase of 9.0% in average
interest-earning assets, which positively impacted earnings by $1,389,000. Total
interest income for 1995, 1994 and 1993 was negatively  impacted by the level of
nonaccrual loans, averaging $3.9 million, $5.4 million and $9.5 million in 1995,
1994 and 1993, respectively.

Total  interest  expense for 1995 was  $6,027,000,  an increase of $1,278,000 or
26.9% from 1994.  This  increase  was,  in part,  the result of an  increase  in
interest  costs from 1.9% in 1994 to 2.3% in 1995,  resulting  in an increase in
interest  expense of  $632,000.  Additionally,  there was an increase of 1.0% in
interest-bearing  liabilities  during 1995, to $193,361,000 from $191,443,000 in
1994,  resulting in an increase in interest expense of $646,000.  Total interest
expense for 1994 declined  16.4% to  $4,749,000  from  $5,684,000 in 1993.  This
decline was primarily  the result of a reduction in interest  costs from 2.4% in
1993 to 1.9% in 1994, resulting in an expense reduction of $987,000.

Positively  impacting the Bank's overall  funding costs was an increase of 10.8%
in 1995 and 22.8% in 1994 of average noninterest-bearing liabilities.

Further  improvement  in net interest  income is  dependent,  in part,  upon the
continued resolution of nonperforming assets.

Total other operating income increased 2.0% in 1995 to $4,005,000 as compared to
$3,928,000 in 1994. In 1994 total other  operating  income  decreased 27.0% from
$5,384,000 in 1993. Contributing factors are discussed below.

Trust fees increased in 1995 to $1,880,000,  or 14.8%,  from 1994. This increase
is primarily attributed to new wealth management and investment services offered
in 1995  along  with an  increase  in the  volume of  estate  fees.  Trust  fees
increased in 1994 by 4.1% over 1993 as a result of an increased fee schedule and
an increase in assets held by the Bank's trust department.

Loan sale gains in 1995 were positively impacted by the adoption of Statement of
Financial  Accounting  Standards No. 122 ("SFAS 122"),  "Accounting for Mortgage
Servicing  Rights".  SFAS 122 requires the  capitalization  of the fair value of
originated mortgage servicing rights in connection with the sale of loans in the
secondary  market.  During 1995,  the Company sold $15.0 million in  residential
mortgage loans while  retaining the rights to service these loans.  Net gains of
$245,000  were  realized  from  the  sale of  these  loans  which  included  the
recognition of a servicing  asset  (originated  mortgage  servicing  rights) and
origination  fees that had been previously  collected and deferred in accordance
with  Statement  of  Financial   Accounting   Standards  No.  91.  Additionally,
residential  mortgage loans  totaling $3.6 million were sold in 1995,  servicing
released, resulting in realized net gains of $42,000. During 1994, $12.8 million
in  residential  mortgage  loans  were  sold  for a net  gain of  $175,000.  The
reduction in  residential  mortgage loan sales in 1994, as compared to 1993, was
due, in part, to an increase in the  origination  of variable  rate  residential
mortgage loans which the Company  generally retains for portfolio as part of its
asset/liability management program.

The other income  category  increased  4.1% in 1995 to $582,000,  primarily  the
result of an increase in fees related to wire transfer services, equity lines of
credit and check services. In 1994 the other operating income category decreased
4.8% from 1993  primarily as a result of net gains  realized in 1993 as a result
of the sale of a bank property.

Negatively  impacting other operating income for 1995 was a net loss of $229,000
on the sale of  securities in the  available  for sale  portfolio.  The security
losses were incurred  primarily in the first quarter of 1995 in connection  with
the  repositioning  of the available  for sale  portfolio  into higher  yielding
government  agency  securities.  During  1994  the Bank  sold  $4.2  million  of
government agency securities from the available for sale portfolio  resulting in
a net gain of $3,000 as  compared  to sales in 1993  totaling  $28.3  million of
securities from the held for sale portfolio realizing a net gain of $370,000.

Service  charges on deposit  accounts  declined  4.2% to  $1,344,000  in 1995 as
compared to $1,403,000  in 1994 due, in part, to a lower volume of  insufficient
funds charges.  In 1994, service charges on deposit accounts increased 9.3% over
1993 as a result  of an  increased  fee  schedule  implemented  during  1994 and
substantial growth in commercial checking accounts.

Mortgage  servicing  fees declined in 1995 to $141,000 from $151,000 in 1994 due
to a decline  of 5.1% in the  average  balance  of  residential  mortgage  loans
serviced for investors.  In 1994,  mortgage  servicing fees increased 98.7% over
1993.  During  1994,  the  Company  became an approved  seller/servicer  for the
Federal  National  Mortgage  Association  and the  Federal  Home  Loan  Mortgage
Corporation  allowing the Company to retain the servicing  rights to residential
mortgage loans sold in the secondary market.

</TABLE>



Total  other  operating  expense  declined  1.8% to  $11,378,000  in  1995  from
$11,587,000 in 1994. This decline was realized  despite the Company's  expansion
by opening an additional  branch  facility  during the third quarter of 1995. In
1994 total other  operating  expense  increased  0.2% from  $11,569,000 in 1993.
Contributing factors are discussed below.

FDIC  insurance  premiums  declined  43.7% to $392,000 in 1995 from  $696,000 in
1994. The decrease is, in part,  attributable to a rebate of insurance  premiums
from the FDIC during the third quarter of 1995.  This action was required due to
statutory  limits  imposed on the Bank  Insurance  Fund by the  Federal  Deposit
Improvement  Act of 1991. In addition,  the  Company's  premiums were reduced in
1995 due to improved capital levels.  The increase in FDIC insurance premiums of
2.5% in 1994 over 1993 was, in large part due to an  increase in deposit  levels
partially offset by a reduction in the Company's insurance premium. The Bank has
estimated 1996 FDIC insurance  premiums to be approximately  $2,000 based on the
current rate  structure  imposed by the FDIC on banks in the "well  capitalized"
category.

Data processing expense declined 26.5% to $575,000 in 1995, primarily due to the
purchase of a new  bank-wide  hardware  and  software  system  during the fourth
quarter of 1994, substantially reducing maintenance and equipment costs. In 1994
data  processing  expense  increased  5.4%  over  1993,  primarily  due to costs
associated  with the  conversion  to the new  bank-wide  hardware  and  software
system.  During 1996,  maintenance  and fees related to the computer  system are
expected to increase as the warranty period expires.

Other real estate owned expense  declined 57.1% in 1995 and 42.2% in 1994 due to
the significant reduction in the levels of foreclosed properties.

Other insurance  premiums  declined 23.3% in 1995 and 12.8% in 1994 due to lower
premium costs as a result of the Company's  improved  financial  condition and a
continued decline in commercial insurance rates.

<PAGE>

Furniture and equipment expense declined 13.4% in 1995 to $292,000 from $337,000
in 1994 as a result of assets becoming fully depreciated, with minimal purchases
of new furniture  and  equipment.  Declines were realized in both  furniture and
equipment  expense despite  additional  costs related to the new branch opening.
Furniture and equipment  expense  declined  33.3% in 1994 from $505,000 in 1993,
primarily  due to the  purchase  of  equipment  previously  leased  and  reduced
maintenance expenses.

Occupancy  expense declined in 1995, by 2.6% or $39,000 and in 1994 by 5.1% from
1993,  primarily due to the  consolidation of previously leased office space. In
1995 this reduction was offset , in part, by the occupancy costs associated with
the new branch facility.

Offsetting these declines in 1995 was an increase in professional  fees of 18.9%
to  $1,119,000  from  $941,000  in 1994,  primarily  due to  strategic  planning
initiatives and costs  associated with revisions to executive  benefit plans. In
1994,  professional fees increased 35.2% over 1993 levels due to corporate legal
costs  associated with capital plans,  the outsourcing of certain  functions and
additional consulting services.

Salaries and benefits increased 3.4% in 1995 as compared to 1994,  primarily due
to the  implementation  of a new bonus and incentive  program and an increase in
the Company's  contribution to the employee  401(k) Plan.  Expenses in 1995 were
also  impacted by the  addition of staff for the new branch  facility.  In 1994,
costs associated with a staff reduction  program led, in part, to an increase of
3.8% over 1993.

The other expense category increased 20.6% in 1995 to $1,598,000 from $1,325,000
in 1994,  primarily the result of advertising  costs  associated  with new Trust
products.  In addition,  in 1995,  expenses  associated  with forms and supplies
increased due to the conversion of the Bank's hardware and software  system,  as
well as the opening of a new branch facility. In 1994 the other expense category
increased 3.0% over 1993 primarily due to forms and supplies associated with the
hardware and software system conversion.


Income Taxes
Since  January 1, 1993 the Company has  accounted for income taxes in accordance
with  Statement  of  Financial   Accounting  Standards  No.  109  ("SFAS  109"),
"Accounting  for Income  Taxes".  As a result of net  operating  losses and loss
carryovers,  the Company had no regular Federal tax liability for the years 1993
through 1995.  The Company paid minimum  federal and state income taxes in 1995,
1994 and 1993.

As  of  December  31,  1995,  the  Company  has  aggregate  net  operating  loss
carryforwards  of  approximately  $5.9  million  for federal  purposes  and $6.5
million for state purposes to offset future income for tax return purposes.

At  December  31,  1995,  the  Company  recorded  a net  deferred  tax  asset of
$2,772,000 representing anticipated future utilization of its net operating loss
carryforwards  as an offset against future  taxable  income.  See Note 10 of the
Notes to the Consolidated  Financial  Statements included at Item 8 of this Form
10-K.

Fourth Quarter Results
The Company  recorded net income of $1,463,000 or $0.14 per fully diluted common
share for the fourth  quarter of 1995 as  compared  to  $1,213,000  or $0.12 per
fully diluted common share for the same period of 1994.

Results of  operations  for the fourth  quarter of 1995, as compared to the 1994
period,  were positively  impacted by the continued  reduction in  nonperforming
assets and operating  expenses along with  improvements in total interest income
and other operating  income.  Net income for the fourth quarter of 1994 included
the  recognition of an additional  deferred tax asset of $200,000 as compared to
no additional deferred tax assets recognized during the same period of 1995. The
Company  had  previously  recognized  substantially  all  of its  remaining  net
deferred tax assets as of September 30, 1995.

Interest  income of $5,374,000  for the fourth  quarter of 1995  represented  an
increase of 13.1% over the same  period in 1994.  This  improvement  in 1995 was
primarily the result of an increase of 6.3% in average  interest-earning  assets
over the 1994 period.

Interest  expense  of  $1,644,000  for the  fourth  quarter  of  1995  increased
$433,000,  or 35.8%,  from the 1994 total of  $1,211,000.  This increase was, in
large  part,  due to an  increase  in the cost of  funds  to 2.5% in the  fourth
quarter of 1995 as compared  to 1.9% for the same period in 1994.  Additionally,
the average balance of interest-bearing  liabilities increased 3.7% in 1995 over
the fourth quarter of 1994.

Other  operating  income  for the  fourth  quarter  of 1995 was  $1,306,000,  as
compared to $1,027,000  for the same period of 1994, an increase of 27.2%.  This
increase  is  primarily  the result of an  improvement  in trust fees due to new
wealth management and investment services offered in 1995. Also, the adoption of
SFAS 122 during the fourth quarter of 1995 resulted in a $171,000 gain.

Other  operating  expense  for the  fourth  quarter of 1995 was  $3,060,000,  as
compared  to  $3,075,000  for the same period of 1994.  This  decline is due, in
part, to a reduction in other real estate owned expense, data processing expense
and FDIC  insurance  premiums.  Partially  offsetting  these  reductions  was an
increase in professional fees due to strategic planning  initiatives  undertaken
in the fourth quarter of 1995.


Asset/Liability Management
The Bank's asset/liability management program focuses on maximizing net interest
income  while  minimizing  balance  sheet risk by  maintaining  what  management
considers  to be an  appropriate  balance  between  the  volume  of  assets  and
liabilities   maturing  or  subject  to  repricing  within  the  same  interval.
Asset/liability  management also focuses on maintaining  adequate  liquidity and
capital.  Interest rate  sensitivity has a major impact on the Bank's  earnings.
Proper  asset/liability  management involves the matching of short-term interest
sensitive  assets and  liabilities to reduce  interest rate risk.  Interest rate
sensitivity is measured by comparing the dollar difference between the amount of
assets  maturing or repricing  within a specified  time period and the amount of
liabilities  maturing  or  repricing  within the same time  period.  This dollar
difference is referred to as the rate sensitivity or maturity "GAP".


                                       36

<PAGE>

Management's goal is to maintain a cumulative one year GAP of under 10% of total
assets.  At December 31, 1995,  the  cumulative  one year GAP as a percentage of
total assets was 6.90%.  The Bank  concentrates  on originating  adjustable rate
loans to hold in its loan portfolio to reduce  interest rate risk.  Deregulation
of deposit  instruments  has allowed the Bank to  generate  deposit  liabilities
whose repricing more closely matches that of its loans.

The  following  table  provides  detail  reflecting  the  approximate  repricing
intervals for rate-sensitive assets and liabilities at December 31, 1995:

</TABLE>

The principal  amount of each asset and liability is included in the above table
in the earliest period in which it matures, reprices or is subject to call.

Nonaccrual loans have been excluded from rate-sensitive  assets. Regular savings
accounts,  money market  accounts and NOW deposits  have been included in the "3
Months or Less" category.  However,  these deposits have  historically  remained
stable  and are an  integral  part of the  Bank's  funding  and  asset/liability
management strategy.

Noninterest-bearing  demand deposits of $78,421,000  have been excluded from the
table.  These deposits,  which also have historically  been stable,  are used to
fund net interest rate sensitive assets beyond three months.


                                       37

<PAGE>

One measure of interest rate  sensitivity  is the excess or deficiency of assets
that  mature or reprice in one year or less.  As shown in the  preceding  table,
rate-sensitive  assets that mature or reprice in one year total $210,644,000 and
rate-sensitive   liabilities   that   mature  or   reprice  in  one  year  total
$189,046,000. The resulting positive one year rate-sensitive gap is $21,598,000.
During  periods of rising  interest  rates,  a positive  gap  position can be an
advantage if more rate-sensitive assets than rate-sensitive  liabilities reprice
at higher rates, creating a favorable impact on net interest income. This impact
may be mitigated somewhat if the level of nonaccrual loans and other real estate
owned  increase,  resulting  in a decrease in  rate-sensitive  assets.  During a
falling rate environment, a negative rate gap can be an advantage.  However, the
impact of rising  and  falling  interest  rates on net  interest  income may not
directly correlate to the Company's GAP position since interest rate changes and
the timing of such changes can be impacted by management's actions as well as by
competitive  and market  factors.  As interest  rates  change,  yields earned on
assets do not necessarily move in parallel with rates paid on liabilities.


Liquidity
Liquidity  management involves the ability to meet the cash flow requirements of
depositors  who want to withdraw  funds or  borrowers  who need  assurance  that
sufficient  funds will be available to meet their credit needs. The objective of
liquidity management is to determine and maintain an appropriate level of liquid
interest-earning  assets. Aside from cash on hand and due from banks, the Bank's
more liquid assets are Federal funds sold and securities  available for sale. On
a daily basis, the Bank lends its excess funds to other commercial  institutions
in need of Federal funds. Such cash and cash equivalents  totaled $38,613,000 or
12.3% of total assets at December 31, 1995, as compared with $18,010,000 or 6.4%
of total  assets  at  December  31,  1994.  Securities  available  for sale were
$85,338,000 at December 31, 1995 compared with $27,190,000 at December 31, 1994.

Demand deposits,  regular  savings,  money market accounts and NOW deposits from
consumer and commercial  customers are a relatively  stable,  low cost source of
funds  which   comprise  a   substantial   portion  of  funding  of  the  Bank's
interest-earning  assets.  Other  sources of asset  liquidity  include  loan and
mortgage-backed  security principal and interest payments,  maturing  securities
and loans, and earnings on investments.

In addition, the Bank has two unsecured lines of credit with correspondent banks
totaling  $5,000,000.  The outstanding  balance of these lines was $5,000,000 at
December 31, 1995.

During the second  quarter of 1995, the Bank became a member of the Federal Home
Loan  Bank of  Boston  ("FHLBB").  Services  offered  by the  FHLBB  include  an
unsecured  credit  line  of up to a  maximum  of 2% of the  Bank's  assets,  and
collateralized  fixed and variable rate  borrowings.  At December 31, 1995 these
available lines amounted to $17.1 million. The FHLBB also offers cash management
services,  investment  services,  as well as lower cost advances for  affordable
housing or community investment  programs.  The Bank did not have any borrowings
from the FHLBB at December 31, 1995.

Additional sources of liquidity are available to the Company through the Federal
Reserve Bank's discount window and the sale of certain investment  securities to
securities  firms and  correspondent  banks under  repurchase  agreements.  Such
agreements are generally short-term.  The outstanding balance of securities sold
under repurchase agreements at December 31, 1995

                                       38


<PAGE>

was $1,050,000. The discount window, if needed, would allow the Company to cover
any short-term  liquidity needs without reducing earning assets. At December 31,
1995,  the Company did not have any borrowings  from the Federal  Reserve Bank's
discount window.

Management  believes  the above  sources of  liquidity  are adequate to meet the
Company's  funding  needs in 1995 and in the  foreseeable  future.  Bancorp  has
minimal  operations  and  therefore  does not generate or utilize a  significant
amount of funds.  Dividends  paid by the Company are funded  utilizing  proceeds
from the exercise of warrants and options and  dividends  received from the Bank
(although no dividends were paid by the Bank in 1995).  Excess proceeds from the
exercise of  warrants  and options may from time to time result in a loan to the
Bank by Bancorp. At December 31, 1995, Bancorp had loaned a total of $426,000 to
the Bank under such arrangement.

The Bank is prohibited by Connecticut  banking law from paying  dividends except
from its net profits,  which are defined as the  remainder of all earnings  from
current  operations.  The  total of all  dividends  declared  by the Bank in any
calendar year may not, unless specifically  approved by the State of Connecticut
Banking Commissioner, exceed the total of its net profits for that year combined
with its retained  net profits  from the  preceding  two years.  These  dividend
limitations  can affect the amount of  dividends  payable to Bancorp as the sole
stockholder of the Bank, and therefore affect Bancorp's  payment of dividends to
its stockholders.


Capital Resources
Stockholders'  equity increased by $7,884,000 or 48.1% in 1995 to $24,282,000 as
compared to $16,398,000 at December 31, 1994.  This increase is primarily due to
earnings of $6.8  million and the  exercise of  1,997,000  warrants by preferred
stockholders, which resulted in additional capital of $1,498,000.  Additionally,
a net  change of  $376,000  in the  unrealized  appreciation  of the  securities
available  for  sale  portfolio  positively  impacted  stockholders'  equity  at
December 31, 1995,  as compared to December 31, 1994.  Stockholders'  equity was
reduced by the payment of $865,000 in  dividends,  which the Company  resumed in
1995.

At December 31, 1995, Bancorp's Tier 1 capital to average assets ratio (leverage
ratio) was 8.18% and its total capital to risk-weighted  asset ratio was 14.02%,
exceeding minimum requirements.

In the fourth quarter of 1992, the Company strengthened capital through a rights
offering to  existing  shareholders.  All  registered  holders of the  Company's
Common Stock as of February 21, 1992 were entitled to acquire  additional shares
of  Common  Stock.  Prior to the  expiration  date of May 31,  1994,  a total of
$1,117,000, net of expenses of $102,000, was raised through the rights offering.

In February 1992, the Company completed a private placement of 46,700 investment
units,  resulting  in total  proceeds  of  $4,670,000  and net  proceeds,  after
expenses,  of  $4,320,000.   Each  unit  consists  of  one  share  of  Series  A
Noncumulative  Convertible  Preferred stock and fifty  warrants.  These warrants
became  exercisable  on January 1, 1994 at an exercise  price of $.75 per share.
During 1995 and 1994 a total of 2,009,500 warrants were exercised,  resulting in
total  proceeds of $1,507,125 to the Company.  At December 31, 1995,  there were
325,500  warrants  outstanding.  There  is no  assurance  as to  the  number  of
warrants,  if any, that will be exercised in the future.  All warrants expire on
December 31, 1996.

                   NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

Note 1
Summary of Significant Accounting and Reporting Policies


Principles of Consolidation
The consolidated  financial statements include the accounts of Westport Bancorp,
Inc.  ("Bancorp")  and its  subsidiary,  The Westport  Bank & Trust Company (the
"Bank") (collectively, the "Company"). All significant intercompany accounts and
transactions have been eliminated.

Basis of Financial Statement Presentation
The  consolidated  financial  statements  have been prepared in accordance  with
generally accepted accounting principles within the banking industry.

In  preparing  the  financial  statements,  management  has made  estimates  and
assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities as of the
date of the  consolidated  statement  of condition  and the reported  amounts of
revenues and expenses during the reporting  period.  Actual future results could
differ  significantly  from these  estimates.  Estimates  that are  particularly
susceptible to significant  change relate to the  determination of the allowance
for loan losses and the valuation of real estate acquired  through  foreclosures
or in  satisfaction  of loans.  In determining the allowance for loan losses and
the valuation of other real estate owned,  independent  appraisals  are obtained
for  significant  properties  collateralizing  loans or other real estate owned.
Future  additions to the allowance for loan losses or  write-downs of other real
estate  owned  may  be  necessary  based  on  changes  in  economic  conditions,
particularly  in the Bank's  service area,  Fairfield  County,  Connecticut.  In
addition, regulatory agencies, as an integral part of their examination process,
periodically  review the Bank's allowance for loan losses and the carrying value
of other real estate owned.  Such agencies may recommend that the Bank recognize
additions to the  allowance for loan losses or the reserve for other real estate
owned based on their judgments and information  available to them at the time of
their examinations.

Securities
Effective  January 1, 1994,  the Bank  adopted  Financial  Accounting  Standards
Board's  ("FASB")  Statement of Financial  Accounting  Standards  No. 115 ("SFAS
115"), "Accounting for Certain Investments in Debt and Equity Securities".  SFAS
115 addresses the accounting and reporting for investments in equity  securities
that have  readily  determinable  fair  values and for all  investments  in debt
securities. Adoption of SFAS 115 did not have a material effect on the financial
statements.

In accordance with SFAS 115, at the time of purchase,  investment securities are
classified  as  available  for  sale  if  the   securities   are  purchased  for
asset/liability  management  and liquidity  purposes,  or as held to maturity if
management  has the  intent  and  ability to hold the  securities  to  maturity.
However,  in the fourth quarter of 1995, the FASB provided  companies with a one
time  opportunity  to  reclassify  securities  between  the  available  for sale
portfolio and the held to


                                       44

<PAGE>

maturity  portfolio.   The  Company  took  advantage  of  this  opportunity  and
reclassified its entire  $42,459,000 held to maturity portfolio to the available
for sale portfolio.  This reclassification  resulted in the transfer of $146,000
to the unrealized depreciation on the securities available for sale component of
stockholder's  equity,  before the related tax effect. This  reclassification is
not  reflected in the  consolidated  statement of cash flows because no cash was
involved.

Securities in the available for sale  portfolio are carried at fair value,  with
unrealized  gains  and  losses  net of tax,  adjusted  for the  amortization  of
premiums or accretion of purchase discounts, recorded in a separate component of
stockholders'  equity.  Gains  and  losses  on the  sale  of  securities  in the
available for sale portfolio are determined by specific  identification  and are
included in operations.

Securities which are classified as held to maturity are stated at cost, adjusted
for  amortization  of premiums or accretion of discounts to the date of maturity
or earlier  call date or, in the case of  mortgage-backed  securities,  over the
estimated  life of the  security.  The Company has the ability and  intention to
hold these investments until maturity.

If a  security  held in  either  the  available  for sale  portfolio  or held to
maturity portfolio has experienced a decline that is other than temporary, it is
written down to estimated fair value through a charge to operations.

Prior to the adoption of SFAS 115 on January 1, 1994,  securities  available for
sale were carried at the lower of aggregate cost or market while securities held
to maturity  were  carried at cost.  In both cases,  cost was  adjusted  for the
amortization of premiums or accretion of discount.


Loans
Effective  January 1, 1995,  the Bank  adopted  FASB's  Statement  of  Financial
Accounting  Standards  No.  114  ("SFAS  114"),  "Accounting  by  Creditors  for
Impairment of a Loan", and Statement of Financial  Accounting  Standards No. 118
("SFAS  118"),  "Accounting  by  Creditors  for  Impairment  of a Loan -  Income
Recognition  and  Disclosures".  SFAS  114 and 118  address  the  accounting  by
creditors for impairment of certain loans and the recognition of interest income
on these loans and requires that  impairment of certain loans be measured  based
on the present  value of expected  future  cash flows  discounted  at the loan's
effective  interest rate or the fair value of  collateral.  The adoption did not
materially affect the Company's  consolidated financial statements or the amount
of the allowance for loan losses.

Interest income on loans is accrued based on rates applied to principal  amounts
outstanding and includes loan fees, net of direct  origination  costs, which are
amortized  over the term of the loan using the interest  method.  The accrual of
interest is discontinued  when: 1) it appears that future collection of interest
or  principal  may be  doubtful,  or 2) when  principal  or  interest is due and
remains unpaid for ninety days or more, unless the loan is both well secured and
in the process of collection. At the time a loan is placed on nonaccrual status,
interest accrued but not collected is generally reversed.  Nonaccrual loans that
commence  repayment are returned to accrual  status only when,  in  management's
opinion,  there has been  demonstrated  performance for a reasonable  period and
continued timely repayment according to loan terms is reasonably



                                       45
<PAGE>
assured.   Restructured  loans  represent  loans  formally  renegotiated  as  to
maturity,  or at  interest  rates  lower  than  market  rates  at  the  time  of
restructure. To the extent these loans are currently performing and the interest
rate remains below market, they are presented as impaired accruing loans and are
included in the consolidated financial statements as nonperforming assets.


Allowance for Loan Losses
The provision for loan losses is the amount deemed  appropriate by management to
maintain the  allowance for loan losses at a level  adequate to absorb  probable
losses  in the  loan  portfolios.  The  allowance  for loan  losses  is based on
estimates;  actual  losses may vary from the current  estimates.  In  estimating
losses,  consideration  is given to the  performance  of the loan, the financial
condition of the borrower or guarantor, an analysis of the borrower's cash flow,
estimates of the current value of the underlying  collateral based on appraisals
or  recent  sale  prices  (net  of  costs  of   disposal),   the  overall   risk
characteristics of the Company's  portfolios,  past credit  experience,  current
economic  and  real  estate  market  conditions,  and  other  relevant  factors.
Management  monitors these factors and  adjustments  are reported in earnings in
the period in which they become known.

When  losses on  specific  loans are judged by  management  to be  certain,  the
portion  deemed  uncollectible  is charged  to the  allowance  for loan  losses.
Subsequent recoveries, if any, are credited to the allowance.

In  accordance  with SFAS 114 and 118,  effective  January  1, 1995 the  Company
revised  the method by which the  allowance  for loan losses is  determined  for
impaired loans. The impact of this change was not material.


Mortgage Banking Activities
The Bank  originates  residential  mortgage  loans,  some of  which  are held in
portfolio and others of which are sold to investors.  Loans  originated for sale
but not yet sold are  carried  at the lower of cost or market.  Origination  and
commitment  fees, net of direct  origination  costs,  relating to sold loans are
recognized  as a component  of the gain on loan  sales.  The Bank  serviced,  on
behalf of  investors,  approximately  $50.7  million,  $41.3  million  and $45.9
million of  residential  mortgage  loans at December  31,  1995,  1994 and 1993,
respectively.

In May 1995,  the  Financial  Accounting  Standards  Board  issued  Statement of
Financial  Accounting  Standards No. 122 ("SFAS 122"),  "Accounting for Mortgage
Servicing  Rights".  SFAS 122 addresses the  accounting  for mortgage  servicing
rights  for   purchased  as  well  as   originated   mortgages  by  a  servicer.
Additionally, SFAS 122 requires the capitalization of the fair value of mortgage
servicing  rights and  amortization  of these  rights in  proportion  to the net
servicing income over the period during which servicing income is expected.  The
Company adopted SFAS 122 in the fourth quarter of 1995. The adoption of SFAS 122
resulted in the  recognition of a servicing  asset of $171,000,  which amount is
included in 1995 loan sale gains on the statement of income.



                                       46

Other Real Estate Owned
Other real  estate  owned  ("OREO")  consists  of  properties  acquired  through
foreclosure.  OREO  properties  are recorded at the lower of cost or fair value,
less estimated  disposal costs, at the date transferred to OREO.  Losses arising
at the time of  transfer  to OREO are charged  against  the  allowance  for loan
losses.  Subsequent write-downs of the carrying value of these properties may be
required to reflect the  properties  at the lower of cost  (market  value at the
date of  transfer  to OREO) or  market  value  and are  charged  to  operations.
Realized gains and losses from the sale of OREO are also included in operations.
Transfers  of  loans  to  OREO of  $450,000  and  $524,000  in  1994  and  1993,
respectively,  are not  reflected  in the  consolidated  statement of cash flows
because no cash was involved in these  transfers.  No loans were  transferred to
OREO during 1995. The 1994 transfer of an OREO  property,  valued at $1,349,000,
to bank-owned  premises is also not reflected in the  consolidated  statement of
cash flows because no cash was involved in the transfer.


Premises and Equipment
Premises and  equipment  are stated at cost less  accumulated  depreciation  and
amortization.  Depreciation  and  amortization  are computed  principally on the
straight-line  method  over the  estimated  useful  life of each  type of asset,
ranging from 3 to 30 years, or the lease term, if shorter.


Income Taxes
In January 1993, the Company adopted Statement of Financial Accounting Standards
No. 109 ("SFAS 109"),  "Accounting  for Income Taxes".  The adoption of SFAS 109
changed the Company's  method of  accounting  for income taxes from the deferred
method (APB Opinion No. 11) to an asset and  liability  approach.  The asset and
liability   approach  requires  the  recognition  of  deferred  tax  assets  and
liabilities  for the expected future tax  consequences of temporary  differences
between  the  financial  reporting  and tax  basis of  assets  and  liabilities.
Adoption  of SFAS 109 had no  effect  on the  Company's  consolidated  financial
statements due to the tax position of the Company at that time.


Earnings Per Share
Primary and fully diluted earnings per share were computed by dividing  earnings
(adjusted,  if applicable)  by the weighted  average number of common shares and
common share  equivalents  outstanding.  For primary earnings per share,  common
share  equivalents are computed using the average closing price of the Company's
common stock for the period. For fully diluted earnings per share,  common share
equivalents  are computed using the closing price of the Company's  common stock
at the end of the period.  Fully diluted  earnings per share were not applicable
in 1994 and 1993.

For the  year  ended  December  31,  1995 and  1994,  the  computation  includes
4,706,250 and 3,148,913 weighted average common shares outstanding and 1,483,337
and 2,787,921  weighted  average common  equivalent  shares,  (fully diluted for
1995), respectively,  computed under the treasury stock method. The earnings per
share  computations also include 4,279,712 and 4,445,000 weighted average common
shares in 1995 and 1994, respectively,  issuable upon the adjusted conversion of
preferred stock. Adjusted earnings consist of net income and the interest effect
of the assumed reduction in short-term  borrowings,  computed under the treasury
stock method.

Other
For purposes of  presenting  the  consolidated  statements  of cash flows,  cash
equivalents  include due from banks,  interest-bearing  deposits  with banks and
Federal  funds sold,  all of which have  original  maturities of three months or
less.

Trust  income is recorded  on an accrual  basis.  Assets held in a fiduciary  or
agency capacity for customers are not included in the consolidated statements of
condition since such items are not assets of the Bank.

Certain amounts from prior years have been reclassified to conform with the 1995
presentation.



Note 2
Regulatory Matters

The Federal Reserve Board and the Federal Deposit Insurance  Corporation  (FDIC)
require bank holding companies and banks,  respectively,  to comply with capital
guidelines based upon the ratio of capital to total assets adjusted for risk.

The following  summarizes the minimum capital requirements and Bancorp's capital
position (there are no significant  differences between the Bank's and Bancorp's
capital ratios) at December 31, 1995.

The Federal  Deposit  Insurance Act ("FDIA"),  as amended by the Federal Deposit
Insurance  Corporation  Improvement Act of 1991 ("FDICIA"),  classifies banks in
one of five categories  according to capital  levels.  At December 31, 1995, the
Company  was "well  capitalized"  under FDIA,  as amended,  based upon the above
capital  ratios.  Deterioration  of economic  conditions  and real estate values
could  adversely  affect  future  results,  leading to increased  levels of loan
charge-offs,  provision  for loan losses and  nonaccrual  loans,  affecting  the
ability of the  Company to maintain  the well  capitalized  classification,  and
resulting in reductions in income and total capital.

At December 31, 1995, the recorded  investment in loans for which impairment has
been recognized in accordance with SFAS 114 and 118 totaled $2,443,000, of which
$1,996,000 were nonaccrual loans. At December 31, 1995, the valuation  allowance
related to all impaired loans totaled  $634,000 and is included in the allowance
for loan losses on the statement of condition.  For the year ended  December 31,
1995, the average recorded  investment in impaired loans was approximately  $5.2
million.  During  1995,  total  interest of $95,000 was  recognized  on accruing
impaired loans.

The Bank would have  recorded an additional  $214,000,  $183,500 and $382,000 of
interest   income  in  the  years  ended  December  31,  1995,  1994  and  1993,
respectively,  if loans on  nonaccrual  status at each year end had been current
throughout  the year. At December 31, 1995,  the Bank has no commitments to lend
additional  funds to  borrowers  whose loans are  classified  as  nonaccrual  or
impaired.  The Bank  would have  recorded  an  additional  $7,700,  $27,000  and
$113,000 of interest income during 1995, 1994 and 1993 if accruing  restructured
loans had made payments in accordance with the original repayment terms.

more was $887,000, $138,000 and $125,000 in 1995, 1994, and 1993, respectively.

Short-term borrowings aggregated $7,733,000 and $10,484,000 at December 31, 1995
and 1994, respectively. Such borrowings include securities sold under agreements
to repurchase of $1,050,000 and $7,800,000 in 1995 and 1994,  respectively,  and
U.S. Treasury note obligations related to treasury, tax and loan deposits in the
amount of  $1,683,000  in 1995 and  $2,684,000  in 1994.  The  weighted  average
interest cost of short-term  borrowings was 5.94% and 4.95% at December 31, 1995
and 1994, respectively, and the terms of the agreements ranged from one to seven
days.

In addition to the securities sold under repurchase agreements and U.S. Treasury
note  obligations,  the Bank  entered  into two  unsecured  Federal fund line of
credit  arrangements with correspondent banks totaling  $5,000,000.  At December
31, 1995, the outstanding balance of these lines was $5,000,000.

During the second  quarter of 1995, the Bank became a member of the Federal Home
Loan  Bank of  Boston  ("FHLBB").  Services  offered  by the  FHLBB  include  an
unsecured  credit  line  of up to a  maximum  of 2% of the  Bank's  assets,  and
collateralized  fixed and variable rate  borrowings.  At December 31, 1995 these
available lines amounted to $17.1 million. The FHLBB also offers cash management
services,  investment  services,  as well as lower cost advances for  affordable
housing or community  investment programs.  During 1995,  borrowings under these
lines were  immaterial.  The Bank did not have any borrowings  from the FHLBB at
December 31, 1995.

Employment Contracts
At December 31, 1995, the Bank was committed  under  employment  agreements with
various key officers requiring aggregate annual salary payments of approximately
$532,000 for the terms of the  contracts  which expire at various  dates through
1998. These agreements provide that if the key officers are terminated following
a change in control (as  defined) of Bancorp,  they are entitled to receive lump
sum severance  payments and to continue to participate in certain  benefit plans
for three years.


Note 9
Stockholders' Equity

Preferred Stock and Warrants
In February 1992,  Bancorp  completed a private  placement of 46,700  investment
units (the  "Private  Placement").  Each unit  consisted  of 1 share of Series A
Noncumulative Convertible Preferred Stock (each share being convertible into 100
shares  of  Common  Stock)  and 50  Warrants  (each  Warrant  being  exercisable
commencing in 1994 for 1 share of Common Stock at an exercise  price of $.75 per
share).  Holders  of record of the  Series A  Preferred  Stock are  entitled  to
dividends, when and if declared by Bancorp's Board of Directors, at a rate to be
determined  by  Bancorp's  Board of  Directors.  Holders  of  shares of Series A
Preferred  Stock vote  together as a class with  holders of the Common Stock for
the  election  of  directors  and all other  matters as to which  holders of the
Common  Stock are  entitled to vote.  Each share of Series A Preferred  Stock is
entitled to 100 votes. All warrants expire on December 31, 1996.


Dividends
Connecticut banking law prohibits the Bank from paying dividends except from its
net profits,  which are defined as the  remainder  of all earnings  from current
operations. The total of all dividends declared by the Bank in any calendar year
may not,  unless  specifically  approved  by the  State of  Connecticut  Banking
Commissioner, exceed the total of its net profits of that year combined with its
retained net profits of the preceding two years. These dividend  limitations can
affect the amount of dividends payable to Bancorp as the sole stockholder of the
Bank, and therefore affect Bancorp's payment of dividends to its stockholders.


Dividend Reinvestment and Stock Purchase Plan
Bancorp introduced a Dividend Reinvestment and Stock Purchase Plan on January 1,
1989. Under the terms of the plan,  participating  stockholders  were allowed to
purchase  additional shares of Common Stock by reinvesting their cash dividends.
Such plan participants could also make optional cash payments,  up to $3,000 per
quarter,  to  purchase  additional  shares.  Shares  purchased  through the plan
directly from Bancorp were priced at 95% of the average market value at the time
of purchase;  shares  purchased in the open market were priced at cost.  Bancorp
discontinued the Dividend Reinvestment and Stock Purchase Plan in 1996.

Stockholder Rights Offering
In the fourth quarter of 1992, holders of Bancorp's Common Stock received rights
to  acquire  additional  shares  of  Common  Stock.  The  rights  entitled  each
shareholder  to purchase one share of Common Stock for every two shares owned as
of February 21, 1992.  The purchase  price was  initially set at $1.50 per share
and  increased to $2.00 on December 1, 1992 and $3.00 on June 1, 1993.  Prior to
its expiration on May 31, 1994, the rights  offering raised  $1,117,000,  net of
expenses.  Bancorp  contributed a total of $1,000,000 of the net proceeds during
1993 and 1994 to the capital of the Bank.


Stock Option Agreements
On December 17, 1992, Bancorp's Board of Directors conditionally granted certain
executive  officers  options  to  purchase  a total of up to  725,000  shares of
Bancorp's  Common Stock at an exercise  price of $2.00 per share,  which was the
fair market value of the stock on that date.  The grants became  effective  upon
approval by the  shareholders of Bancorp at the 1993 Annual Meeting of Bancorp's
shareholders.  These stock options become exercisable gradually over a five year
period and expire within ten years following the date of the conditional  grant.
All unexpired options become immediately  exercisable if a change in control (as
defined) of Bancorp occurs.


Incentive Stock Option Plans
Under the 1995  Incentive  Stock  Option  Plan (the "1995  Plan"),  the Board of
Directors  may grant  options to  purchase  a total of up to  200,000  shares of
Bancorp's  Common Stock to key employees of Bancorp and the Bank. Under the 1985
Incentive Stock Option Plan (the "1985 Plan"),  for which the authority to grant
options  expired on December 31, 1995, the Board was authorized to grant options
to purchase a total of up to 300,000  shares of  Bancorp's  Common  Stock to key
employees of Bancorp and the Bank. The exercise  price of options  granted under
the Plans are set at the market price of  Bancorp's  Common Stock on the date of
the grant.  Each option may be  exercised  as to one-half of the total number of
shares covered by such option after one year of continuous  employment,  and, as
to the other one-half,  after two years of continuous  employment.  Options,  in
both Plans, expire ten years after the date of their grant. No options have been
granted under the 1995 Plan.

assets  (included  in Other  Assets) of  $2,772,000,  $1,650,000  and  $350,000,
respectively,   for  anticipated   future  utilization  of  net  operating  loss
carryforwards  ("NOL's") and the tax effect of other temporary  differences.  At

In addition,  $470,000  and $256,000 of state taxes (net of the related  federal
tax benefit)  were not provided in 1995 and 1994,  respectively,  because of the
utilization of state NOL's.

At  December  31,  1995,  the only  temporary  difference  which gives rise to a
significant  portion of the tax effected  temporary  differences shown above was
the loan loss allowance, which resulted in a deferred liability of approximately
$340,000.

Employee Benefit Plans

The Bank has a  qualified  noncontributory  defined  benefit  pension  plan (the
"Pension  Plan")  covering all  employees  over the age of 21 who have worked at
least 1,000 hours per year. The Pension Plan was temporarily  frozen,  effective
January 1, 1992,  resulting in no additional  benefits for future  service since
that date. The Bank also has a non-qualified  supplemental  executive retirement
plan (the "Supplemental  Plan") for certain senior officers.  Under the terms of
the  Supplemental  Plan, if participants  are terminated on or after their early
retirement date following a change in control (as defined) of Bancorp,  they are
entitled to receive benefits which amount to 70% of average annual compensation,
reduced by a factor  for age and any  pension  benefits.  During  1995,  several
participants  were  discontinued  from the  Supplemental  Plan,  resulting  in a
curtailment gain.

The  following  table sets forth the funded  status of the plans and the amounts
shown in the accompanying  consolidated  statements of condition at December 31,
1995 and 1994:

Pension  Plan  assets  are  primarily   invested  in  fixed  income  and  equity
securities.  The net  unrecognized  loss from  past  experience  different  than
assumed is being amortized on a straight line basis over 12 years. The Bank uses
the  straight-line  method of  amortization  for prior  service  cost (over 10.8
years) and  unrecognized  gains and losses (over 12 years) which  aggregate more
than 10% of the value of plan assets.

The Bank also has a  qualified  Employee  Stock  Ownership  Plan  ("ESOP")  and,
commencing in 1992, a 401(k) Plan covering all eligible employees. Contributions
to the ESOP are at the  discretion  of the Board of  Directors  of the Bank;  no
contributions  were made in 1995, 1994 or 1993.  Participants in the 401(k) Plan
are entitled to contribute up to 20% of their compensation,  subject to Internal
Revenue Service annual  limitations.  The Bank  contributed 25% in 1993 and 1994
and 50% of annual  employee  contributions  in 1995, up to 6% of a participants'
compensation.  Employees are fully vested in the Bank's contributions after five
years of  service.  The Bank  contributed  $91,000,  $49,000  and $20,000 to the
401(k) Plan in 1995, 1994 and 1993, respectively.

Related Party Transactions

The  Bank  purchases  insurance  from an  insurance  brokerage  firm  owned by a
director  of the  Bank  and  Bancorp.  This  director  is the  president  of the
insurance  firm.  During 1995, the Bank made  insurance  payments of $364,062 to
this firm.  Payments  to this firm for  insurance  premiums  were  $326,791  and
$475,462 during 1994 and 1993, respectively.

The Bank  leases  office  space from a trust of which a director of the Bank and
Bancorp serves as trustee.  Rental payments of $54,584,  $53,740 and $53,527 for
this office space were paid during 1995, 1994 and 1993, respectively.

The Bank also leases office space from a trust which benefits a family member of
a director  of the Bank and  Bancorp.  The Bank made  rental  payments  totaling
$194,196,  $195,000  and  $184,141  during  1995,  1994 and 1993,  respectively,
relating to this office space.

New Accounting Standards Not Yet Adopted

In  March  1995,  the  Financial  Accounting  Standards  Board  ("FASB")  issued
Statement of Financial  Accounting  Standards No. 121 ("SFAS 121"),  "Accounting
for the Impairment of Long-Lived Assets and for Long-Lived Assets to be Disposed
Of". SFAS 121 establishes  accounting standards for the impairment of long-lived
assets, certain identifiable  intangibles,  and goodwill related to those assets
to be  held  and  used  and  for  long-lived  assets  and  certain  identifiable
intangibles  to be disposed  of. SFAS 121 applies to  financial  statements  for
fiscal years beginning after December 15, 1995. Bancorp does not anticipate that
adoption of this  pronouncement  will have a material impact on its consolidated
financial statements.

In October 1995, FASB issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 123
("SFAS 123"),  "Accounting for Stock-Based  Compensation".  SFAS 123 establishes
financial   accounting  and  reporting   standards  for   stock-based   employee
compensation  plans.  SFAS 123 is  effective  for fiscal years  beginning  after
December  15,  1995.   Bancorp  does  not  anticipate   that  adoption  of  this
pronouncement  will  have  a  material  impact  on  its  consolidated  financial
statements.

There are various  restrictions  which limit the ability of a bank subsidiary to
transfer  funds in the form of cash  dividends,  loans or advances to its parent
company. The Bank is prohibited by Connecticut banking law from paying dividends
except from its net profits,  which are defined as the remainder of all earnings
from current operations.  The total of all dividends declared by the Bank in any
calendar year may not, unless specifically approved by the Commissioner,  exceed
the  total of its net  profits  for that year  combined  with its  retained  net
profits from the preceding two years. These dividend  limitations can affect the
amount of dividends  payable to Bancorp as the sole stockholder of the Bank, and
therefore affect Bancorp's payment of dividends to its stockholders.

In  addition,  the Bank is  subject to  restrictions  under  Section  23A of the
Federal Reserve Act. These  restrictions limit the transfer of funds to a parent
company, in the form of loans or extensions of credit, investments and purchases
of assets.  Such transfers are limited to 10% of the Bank's capital and surplus.
These transfers are also subject to various collateral requirements.


Note 15
Financial Instruments with Off-Balance
Sheet Risk and Concentrations of Credit Risk

The Bank is a party to financial instruments with off-balance sheet risk entered
into in the  normal  course  of  business  to meet  the  financing  needs of its
customers.  These  financial  instruments  include  commitments to extend credit
(unfunded loans and unused lines of credit) and standby letters of credit.

                                       65

<PAGE>

Commitments  to extend  credit are  agreements  to lend to a customer as long as
there is no violation of any condition established in the contract.  Commitments
generally  have fixed  expiration  dates or other  termination  clauses  and may
require  payment of a fee. Since a portion of these  commitments are expected to
expire without being drawn upon, the total commitment amounts do not necessarily
represent  future cash  requirements.  The Bank uses the same credit policies in
making  commitments as it does for on-balance  sheet  instruments  and evaluates
each  customer's  creditworthiness  on  a  case-by-case  basis.  The  amount  of
collateral  obtained,  if deemed necessary by the Bank, upon extension of credit
is based on  management's  credit  evaluation of the borrower.  Collateral  held
varies, but may include real estate,  accounts receivable,  inventory,  property
and securities.

Standby  letters of credit  are  conditional  commitments  issued by the Bank to
guarantee the performance of a customer to a third party.  Those  guarantees are
primarily  issued at the customer's  request to support various  personal and/or
business  obligations.  The credit risk involved in issuing letters of credit is
essentially the same as that involved in extending loan facilities to customers.
The  amount  of  credit  is  based  on  management's  credit  evaluation  of the
counterparty.  Collateral  held varies but may  include  real  estate,  accounts
receivable, inventory, property, securities and certificates of deposit.

The Bank's maximum exposure to credit loss from outstanding loan commitments and
standby letters of credit at December 31, 1995 was:

The Bank  grants  residential,  commercial  and  consumer  loans  to  customers,
principally  in  the  town  of  Westport  and  the  Fairfield   County  area  of
Connecticut.  Although the loan portfolio is diversified,  a substantial portion
of its debtors'  ability to honor their contracts is dependent upon the economic
conditions in the area, especially in the real estate sector. There are no other
concentrations of loans exceeding 10% of total loans.

Note 16
Fair Value of Financial Instruments

Statement of Financial Accounting  Standards No. 107 ("SFAS 107"),  "Disclosures
about Fair Value of Financial Instruments", requires disclosure of the estimated
fair  value  of  financial  instrument  assets,  liabilities,   commitments  and
guarantees. Approximately 96% of the Company's assets and 99% of its liabilities
are  considered  financial  instruments  as  defined  in SFAS  107.  Many of the
Company's financial  instruments,  however,  lack an available trading market as
characterized  by a willing  buyer and  willing  seller  engaging in an exchange
transaction.  In addition,  the majority of the Company's financial instruments,
such as loans  and  deposits,  are held to  maturity  and are  realized  or paid
according to the contractual agreement with the customer.

Significant  estimations and present value calculations were used by the Company
for the purposes of this  disclosure.  The  estimation  methodologies  used, the
estimated fair values, and financial statement balances at December 31, 1995 and
1994 ($ in thousands) are shown below.

Financial  instrument  assets  actively  traded in a secondary  market have been
valued at quoted available market prices. For short-term financial  instruments,
the financial statement balance equals fair market value.

Changes in assumptions or estimation methodologies may have a material effect on
these estimated fair values.

Management  is  concerned  that  reasonable   comparability   between  financial
institutions  may not be possible due to the wide range of  permitted  valuation
techniques and numerous estimates which must be made given the absence of active
secondary  markets for many of the financial  instruments.  This lack of uniform
valuation  methodologies  also  introduces a greater degree of  subjectivity  to
these estimated fair values.

All off-balance sheet items are believed to relate to quality assets.  There are
no off-balance sheet items that relate to adversely  classified assets. The fees
charged for off-balance sheet items are at fair values for similar transactions.
See Note 15 for further information on off-balance sheet items.

                    REPORT OF INDEPENDENT PUBLIC ACCOUNTANTS




To the Board of Directors of
Westport Bancorp, Inc.:

We have  audited  the  accompanying  consolidated  statements  of  condition  of
Westport  Bancorp,  Inc. (a Delaware  corporation) and subsidiary as of December
31, 1995 and 1994, and the related consolidated statements of income, changes in
stockholders'  equity  and cash  flows for each of the  years in the three  year
period  ended   December  31,  1995.   These   financial   statements   are  the
responsibility of the Company's management.  Our responsibility is to express an
opinion on these financial statements based on our audits.

We  conducted  our  audits  in  accordance  with  generally   accepted  auditing
standards. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain
reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material
misstatement.  An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting
the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements.  An audit also includes
assessing the  accounting  principles  used and  significant  estimates  made by
management,  as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation.
We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.

In our opinion,  the financial  statements  referred to above present fairly, in
all material respects,  the consolidated financial position of Westport Bancorp,
Inc. and  subsidiary as of December 31, 1995 and 1994,  and the results of their
operations  and their cash flows for each of the years in the three year  period
ended  December 31, 1995,  in  conformity  with  generally  accepted  accounting
principles.

         (a) The Lessee shall pay annually as additional  rent,  that portion of
any real  estate  taxes  assessed  against  the land and  building  of which the
Demised  Premises  are a part,  which the total  number of square  feet of floor
space in the Demised


                                        1

<PAGE>



Premises  bears to the total number of square feet of  leaseable  floor space in
the  entire  building  which the  parties  acknowledge  at the  present  time is
10.8494%.  Changes in the applicable floor areas shall result in a corresponding
pro rata  adjustment  of the  aforesaid  percentage.  Such amount shall be paid,
without setoffs or deductions of any kind,  within thirty (30) days after demand
therefor  by the Lessor and shall be  collectible  as rent.  Tax bills  shall be
sufficient  evidence  of the  amount  of such  taxes  and  shall be used for the
calculation  of the amounts to be paid by the Lessee.  "Real Estate Taxes" shall
mean all taxes or assessments and governmental  charges whether Federal,  State,
County or Municipal which are levied or charged against real estate or rents, or
on the right or privilege of leasing real estate or collecting rents thereon and
any  other  taxes and  assessments  attributable  to  Lessor's  Building  herein
described or its operation,  excluding,  however Federal,  State or other income
taxes.


         (b) Lessee shall pay to the Lessor,  at the same time as the Basic Rent
is paid,  without demand or setoff or deductions of any kind, as additional rent
for each month  during the term of this Lease,  that  proportion  of  "Operating
Expenses"  (as  defined  below)  which the total  number of square feet of floor
space in the  Demised  Premises  bears to the total  number  of  square  feet of
leaseable  floor space in the entire  Building which the parties  acknowledge at
the present time is 10.8494%. Changes in the applicable floor areas shall result
in a  corresponding  pro rata adjustment of the aforesaid  percentage.  The term
"Operating  Expenses" shall mean all actual operating  expenses paid or incurred
by Lessor for the operation of Lessor's Building.

         (c) The  annual  charge  to  Tenant  for  Operating  Expenses  shall be
computed on the basis of periods of twelve (12)  consecutive  calendar months as
designated  by Lessor and shall  during the first such  period of  operation  of
Lessor's  Building be estimated by Lessor and thereafter shall be based upon the
prior period's actual  expenses and shall be paid by Lessee,  as additional rent
hereunder,  in equal  installments  in advance of the first day of each calendar
month in an amount of one-twelfth (1/12th) of the amount estimated by Lessor for
the year.  For any such  period  within the Term which is less than a full year,
the annual charge shall be appropriately prorated.  Within sixty (60) days after
the end of each twelve month  period,  Lessor will furnish to Lessee a statement
showing in  reasonable  detail,  the amount of Lessor's  operating  cost for the
preceding period, and any necessary adjustments shall thereupon be made, and the
monthly  payments to be made by Lessee for the ensuing  year shall be  estimated
accordingly.  Changes in applicable  floor areas of the Building shall result in
corresponding pro rata adjustments.


         (d) Lessee shall pay as additional rent to the Lessor, at the same time
as the Basic Rent is paid,  without demand or setoff, and in accordance with the
terms of this Agreement, an amount determined as follows:

                  (i) The  Core  Area of the  ground  floor  level  which is 826
square feet multiplied by a fraction,  the numerator of which is the square foot
area set forth in Paragraph  1(a) above (square  feet),  and the  denominator of
which is the total leaseable  square footage for the ground floor level which is
9,914 square feet. The product of this  calculation  shall be known as the "Core
Area Allocator".

                  (ii)  The  Core  Area  Allocator  shall  be  multiplied  by  a
fraction, the numerator of which is the annual basic rent set forth in Paragraph
1 above and the denominator of which is the square footage area leased to Lessee
set forth in Paragraph 1(a) above.


                  (iii)  "Core  Area" for the  purpose of this  Paragraph  shall
include,  as may be applicable:  Public corridors,  air-conditioning  shafts and
ducts  where a central  air-  conditioning  system  eliminates  floor fan rooms,
stairs,

closets,  shop sinks,  electrical  closets,  telephone closets and all enclosing

Premises  or that floor upon which the  Demised  Premises  are  located,  may be
decreased  or  increased  from  time to time as the  Lessor  shall  in its  sole
discretion find appropriate.

         (e) It is the purpose and intent of Lessor and Lessee as  evidenced  by
Paragraphs  2(a),  2(b),  2(d) and 9 that this Lease be a net lease and that the
basic rent shall be  absolutely  net to Lessor so that this Lease  shall  yield,
net,  to Lessor,  the basic rent  specified  in  Paragraph 1 above and each year
during  the  original  term of this  Lease and the basic  rent  provided  for in
Paragraph  34 below  during  each  renewal  term of this  Lease,  if  renewed as
provided in said  Paragraph 34, and that all costs  expenses and  obligations of
every kind and nature  whatsoever  relating to the Demised  Premises,  which may
arise or become due during or out of the  original or any  renewal  term of this
Lease shall be paid by Lessee,  in its pro rata share,  and that Lessor shall be
indemnified  and saved  harmless by Lessee from and against the same;  provided,
however,  that nothing herein  contained shall be construed to require Lessee to
pay the  principal of, or the interest on, any  indebtedness  secured by any fee
mortgage.  The  principal  and interest of nay such  mortgage  shall be the sole
responsibility of Lessor.

         3.  Purpose.  Lessee shall use and occupy the Demised  Premises for the

or the Building of which they form a part,  or bring or keep  anything  therein,
which  shall in any way  increase  the rate of fire or other  insurance  on said
Building,  or on the property kept therein,  or obstruct,  or interfere with the
rights of other  tenants,  or in any way,  injure or annoy them, or those having
business  with them,  or conflict  with them,  or conflict with the fire laws or

occupancy of the premises, or any act or omission of Lessee.

thereof to be used for any disorderly,  unlawful or extra hazardous  purpose nor
for any  purpose  other than as set forth in  Paragraph  3 above,  and shall not

without the prior written consent of Lessor.

their  present  condition  and  without any  representations  on the part of the
Lessor  or its  agents as to the  present  or future  condition  of the  Demised
Premises.  The Lessee  shall keep the  Demised  Premises in good  condition  and
repair and shall  redecorate,  paint and renovate the Demised Premises as may be
reasonably  required  by  Lessor  to keep them in good  repair  and  appearance;
provided,  however,  that Lessor  shall  maintain  and keep in repair the walls,
foundation  and roof of the  Building of which the Demised  Premises are a part,
the plumbing,  and electrical systems, and other installations serving more than
one tenant of said building.

         (d) The Lessee shall quit and surrender the Demised Premises at the end

above. In the event Lessee shall fail so to do, then Lessor shall have the right
to make  such  necessary  repairs,  alterations  and  replacements,  structural,
nonstructural  or otherwise,  and any charge or cost so incurred by Lessor shall
be paid by  Lessee,  with  the  right  on the  part of  Lessor  to  elect in its

shall  be  construed  as an  additional  remedy  granted  to  Lessor  and not in
limitation  of any  rights  and  remedies  which  Lessor has or may have in said
circumstances.  The Lessee agrees to replace at the Lessee's expense any and all
glass which may become  broken in and on the Demised  Premises.  Plate glass and
mirrors, if any, shall be insured by the Lessee at their full insurable value by

installations,  changes, replacements, additions, or improvements, structural or
otherwise, in or to the Demised Premises or any part thereof,  without the prior

replacements,  additions,  or improvements,  structural or otherwise shall be in

consent)  shall be at the election of Lessor  remain upon the Demised  Premises,
and be  surrendered  with the Demised  Premises at the expiration of this Lease,
without   disturbance,   molestation   or  injury.   Should  Lessor  elect  that
alterations,  installations, changes, replacements, additions to or improvements
upon the Demised  Premises be removed,  upon  termination of this Lease,  Lessee
hereby  agrees to cause same to be removed at Lessee's sole cost and expense and

Lessor may suffer and sustain by reason of failure of Lessee to remove the same.

Lessor  discharge  said lien. If Lessee fails to discharge said lien within said
ten (10) day period,  the Lessor, at its option, may terminate this Lease and/or

inscribed,  painted  or  affixed  on any part of the  outside  or  inside of the
Demised  Premises or Building,  except on the  directories and doors of offices,
and then only in such  size,  color and style as Lessor  shall  approve.  Lessor
intends to have common signage. Lessor shall have the right to prohibit any such
advertisement  of any sign which, in the Lessor's  opinion,  tends to impair the
reputation of the Building or its  desirability as a Building for offices or for
financial,  insurance or other  institutions and businesses of like nature,  and
upon written notice from Lessor,  Lessee shall refrain from and  discontinue any
such advertisement.

         8. Floor Load.  Lessor shall have the right to prescribe the weight and
method  of  installation  and  position  of  safes or other  heavy  fixtures  or
equipment.  All damage  done to the  Building by taking in or removing a safe or
any other  article of Lessee's  fixtures or  equipment  shall be repaired at the
expense  of  Lessee.  No  freight,  furniture  or  other  bulky  matter  of  any
description  will be received  into the  Building  or carried in the  elevators,

electricity,  light, power,  telephone and all other utility service and heating
and  air-conditioning  charges used,  rendered or supplied upon or in connection
with the  Demised  Premises  and shall  indemnify  Lessor  and save it  harmless
against any liability or charges on account thereof.

         (b) Lessor shall receive the statement for charges for electricity (for
light,  power,  heating,  and  air-conditioning)  for the entire building within

of electrical  usage.  Lessor shall allocate Lessee's share of electrical usage,
in accordance with a  determination  made from time to time as to usage for each
of the  Lessees  of the  Building  by a  representative  of United  Illuminating
Company or such other  Public  Service  Corporation  as may at any time  provide
electrical  service to the Building.  Lessee shall pay as additional rent within
ten (10) days after  mailing by Lessor to Lessee  statements  applicable  to its
share of such charges.

         (c) In the event that Lessor  shall elect or be required to furnish any
additional  utility or other  service to Lessee,  Lessee  agrees to purchase the
same from Lessor and Lessee shall pay Lessor  within ten (10) days after mailing
by Lessor to Lessee  statements  therefor at the applicable  rates determined by
Lessor  from time to time which  Lessor  agrees  shall be  equitable  and,  with
respect to  utilities,  not in excess of the consumer  late as is charged by the
Public Service  Corporation or municipal  authority as the case may be supplying
similar services in the general area in which the Demised Premises are situated.
The  aforesaid  charges  shall be  collectable  by  Lessor  as  additional  rent
hereunder without deduction or setoff.

         (d)  Lessor  shall not be liable to Lessee for any  damages  should the
furnishing  of any  utilities  or other  services  by Lessor be  interrupted  or
required to be terminated  because of necessary  repairs or  improvements or any
cause beyond the reasonable  control of Lessor,  nor shall any such interruption
or cessation  relieve Lessee from the performance of any of Lessee's  covenants,
conditions, or agreements under this Lease.

         (e) Regardless of whether Lessee or Lessor is paying utilities or other
charges in accordance with the foregoing  provisions of this Paragraph 9, Lessee
shall not install or operate in the Demised Premises any  electrically  operated
equipment or other machinery or lighting,  other than standard office equipment,
without  first  obtaining  the prior  consent  in  writing  of  Lessor,  who may
condition  such  consent  upon the  payment  by  Lessee  of  additional  rent in
compensation for such

                                        5

<PAGE>
excess consumption of water and/or electricity or wiring as may be occasioned by
the operation of said equipment or machinery; nor shall Lessee install any other
equipment whatsoever which will or may necessitate any changes,  replacements or
additions to or require the use of the water system,  plumbing  system,  heating
system, air conditioning system or the electrical system of the Demised Premises
without the prior written consent of Lessor.

         10. Right of  Inspection  and Repair.  Lessee shall allow  Lessor,  its
agents or  employees,  to enter the Demised  Premises at all times to examine or
inspect the Demised  Premises or the  Building or to protect the same or prevent
damage or injury to the same, or to make such  alterations and repairs as Lessor
may deem  necessary;  or to exhibit the same to  prospective  tenants during the
last six (6) months of the Term.

         11. Rent Adjustment. Intentionally Deleted

         12. Rules and  Regulations.  The following rules and  regulations,  and
such other and  further  rules and  regulations  as Lessor may make and which in
Lessor's  judgment  are needed for the  general  well  being,  safety,  care and
cleanliness  of  Demised  Premises  and the  Building  of which  they are a part
together  with their  appurtenances,  shall be  faithfully  kept,  observed  and
performed by Lessee,  and by his agents,  servants,  employees and guests unless
waived in writing by Lessor. Lessee agrees:

         (a) To store all trash and  garbage in adequate  containers  within the
Demised Premises, maintained in a neat and clean condition and located as Lessor
shall from time to time designate,  within the Demised  Premises and outside the
Demised  Premises on collection  days, and so as not to be visible to the public
in or  outside of the  Building  and so as not to create or permit any health or
fire hazard, and arrange for regular removal thereof at Lessee's expense. Lessor
hereby  reserves the right at its sole discretion to establish trash and garbage
collection  procedures  on Lessee's  behalf and at  Lessee's  expense and Lessee
hereby agrees to comply with such procedures and to pay to Lessor said charge as
additional rent hereunder at locally  competitive  rates.  Lessor shall have the
right  to  cause  such  procedures  to be  established  through  an  independent
contractor  and  Lessee  agrees to pay  therefor  directly  to such  independent
contractor, if requested.


         (b) Not to burn any  papers,  trash or  garbage of any kind in or about
the Demised Premises or the Building.

         (c) Not to  overload  any  floor  in the  Demised  Premises,  or use or

disturbs other tenants in the Building.

sleeping apartments or lodging rooms.

overnight parking or storage of vehicles.

         (g) Not to conduct any going-out-of-business, fire, bankruptcy, auction
or other distress sale on the Demised Premises.

         (h) Not to use any sidewalks,  walkways or common areas of the Building

         (w) No  additional  locks  shall be  placed  upon ay  doors of  Demised

         13.  Liability.  The  Lessor  shall not be liable for any  accident  or

the Lessee.  The Lessor  shall not be  responsible  for the loss of or damage to
property,  or injury to persons,  occurring in or about the Demised Premises, by
reason of any  existing  or  future  condition,  defect,  matter or thing in the
Demised  Premises or the property of which the  premises are a part,  or for the
acts,  omissions or negligence of other persons or tenants in and about the said

occurring in or about the Demised Premises.

         14. Lessor's Services.  Lessor shall furnish an automatically  operated

a part  opened  from 7 a.m.  to 8 p.m.,  Monday  through  Friday and from 7 a.m.
through 4 p.m. on Saturdays. The Building may be closed on Sunday.

         15. Bankruptcy or Involuntary Transfer. If at any time during the Term,
a petition shall be filed, either by or against Lessee, in any Court or pursuant
to any Federal, State, or municipal statute, whether in bankruptcy,  insolvency,
or for the  appointment  of a receiver  of Lessee's  property,  or if the Lessee
shall make an assignment for the benefit of creditors or if Lessee's interest in
this  Lease  becomes  the  subject  of a tax  lien,  then  immediately  upon the
happening of any such event, and without any entry or other act by Lessor,  this
Lease,  at  Lessor's  option,  shall  cease and come to an end;  however,  it is
further  stipulated  and agreed that, in the event of termination of the Term by
the happening of any such event, Lessor shall forthwith,  upon such termination,
become  entitled to recover as and for liquidated  damages caused by such breach
of the  provisions of this Lease an amount equal to the  difference  between the
then cash value of the rent and charges equal to rent reserved hereunder for the
unexpired  portion of the Term and the then  reasonable cash rental value of the
Demised Premises, for such unexpired portion of the Term. The provisions of this
paragraph of this Lease shall be without prejudice to Lessor's right to prove in
full damages for rent accrued prior to termination of this Lease,  but not paid.
In making any such  computation,  the then cash rental value of Demised Premises
shall be deemed prima facie be the rental  realized upon any reletting,  if such
reletting  can be  accomplished  by Lessor  within a reasonable  time after such
termination  of this  Lease,  and then  present  cash value of the future  rents
hereunder,  reserved  to Lessor for the  unexpired  portion  of the term  hereby
demised  shall be deemed to be such sum,  if  invested at the prime rate as will
produce the future rent over the period of time in question.

         16. Remedies. It is agreed that if Lessee shall fail to pay the rent or
any  installment  thereof as aforesaid at the time the same shall become due and
payable and/or any additional rent as herein provided,  although no demand shall
have been made for the same;  or if Lessee  shall  violate or fail or neglect to
keep and perform  any of the  covenants,  conditions,  rules,  regulations,  and
agreements contained in the Lease on the part of Lessee to be kept and performed
or if this Lease shall be


                                8
<PAGE>
assigned  or the leased  premises  sublet or if Demised  Premises  shall  become
vacant or  deserted,  then,  and in each and every  such  event and at all times
thereafter,  at option of Lessor,  Lessee's right of possession  shall thereupon
cease and  terminate  and Lessor  shall be  entitled  to  possession  of Demised
Premises  and to reenter  the same  without  notice to quit or demand of rent or
demand of  possession,  and the Lessor or its agents shall have the right to and
may  enter the said  premises  as the  agent of the  Lessee,  either by force or
otherwise, without being liable for any prosecution or damages therefor, and may
relet the  premises as the agent of the Lessee,  and receive the rent  therefor,
upon such terms as shall be  satisfactory  to the Lessor,  and all rights of the
Lessee to  repossess  the  premises  under this Lease shall be  forfeited.  Such
reentry by the Lessor  shall not  operate to release the Lessee from any rent to
be paid or covenant to be performed hereunder during the full Term of the Lease.
For the  purpose of  reletting,  the  Lessor  shall be  authorized  to make such
repairs or  alterations  in or to the Demised  Premises as may be  necessary  to
place the same in good order and  condition.  The Lessee  shall be liable to the
Lessor for the cost of such  repairs or  alterations,  and all  expenses of such
reletting.  If  the  sum  realized  or to be  realized  from  the  reletting  is
insufficient  to satisfy  the monthly or term rent  provided in this Lease,  the
Lessor,  at its option,  may require the Lessee to pay such deficiency  month by
month,  or may hold the  Lessee  in  advance  for the  entire  deficiency  to be
realized  during the term of the reletting.  The Lessee shall not be entitled to
any surplus accruing as a result of the reletting.  The Lessee agrees to pay, as
additional  rent,  reasonable  attorneys'  fees and  other  reasonable  expenses
incurred by the Lessor in enforcing any of the obligations  under this Lease. No
provision  of this Lease  shall be deemed to have been  waived by Lessor  unless
such  waiver  shall be in  writing  signed by  Lessor.  No  payment by Lessee or
receipt  by Lessor of a lesser  amount  than the  monthly  installments  of rent
herein  stipulated  shall be deemed to be other than on account of the  earliest
stipulated  rent,  nor shall any  endorsement  or  statement on any check or any
letter  accompanying  any check or  payment  as rent be  deemed  an  accord  and
satisfaction,  and Lessor may accept such check or payment without  prejudice to
Lessor's right to recover the balance of such rent or pursue any other remedy in
this Lease provided.

          17.  Damage or Destruction.

         (a) In the event of the  destruction  of the  Demised  Premises  or the
Building  containing  the said  premise  by fire,  explosion,  the  elements  or
otherwise during the Term, or previous thereto,  or such partial  destruction of
the  Demised  Premises  as to  render  them  wholly  untenantable  or unfit  for
occupancy,  or should the  Demised  Premises be so badly  injured  that the same
cannot be repaired  within  ninety (90) days from the  happening of such injury,
then,  in any such case,  the term hereby  created  shall,  at the option of the
Lessor,  cease  and  become  null and void  from  the  date of such  damage  and
destruction,  the Lessee shall  immediately  surrender said premises and all the
Lessee's interest therein to the Lessor,  and shall pay rent only to the time of
such surrender, in which event the Lessor may reenter and repossess the premises
thus discharged from this Lease and may remove all parties therefrom.

         (b) If the Demised  Premises  are rendered  untenantable  and unfit for
occupancy but are repairable  within ninety (90) days from the happening of said
injury, the Lessor may elect to enter and repair the same with reasonable speed,
and the rent shall not accrue after said injury or while repairs are being made,
but shall recommence immediately after said repairs shall be completed.

         (c) If the Demised  Premises shall be so slightly  injured as not to be
rendered untenantable and unfit for occupancy,  then the Lessor agrees to repair
the same  with  reasonable  promptness  and in that  case the rent  accrued  and
accruing shall not cease or be otherwise adjusted.


                                9

<PAGE>
         (d) The Lessee shall immediately  notify the Lessor in case of fire or
other damage to the Demised Premises.  No compensation,  or claim, or diminution
of rent will be allowed or paid by Lessor by reason of inconvenience,  annoyance
or injury to  business  arising  from the  necessity  of  repairing  the Demised
Premises or the Building of which they are a part.


         18.  Subordination.  This Lease is and shall be subject and subordinate
to all ground or underlying  leases and to any  mortgages  and/or deeds of trust
(hereinafter  all of the  foregoing are  collectively  referred to as the "Other
Instruments") which may now or hereafter affect such leases or the real property
of which  Demised  Premises  form a part,  and to all  renewals,  modifications,
consolidations,  replacements  and  extensions  thereof.  In  the  event  of any
conflict between the provisions of the Other  Instruments,  on the one hand, and
this Agreement on the other, the terms of the Other  Instruments  shall control.
This clause shall be self-operative  and no further  instrument of subordination
shall be required by any mortgagee or trustee. Nevertheless, simultaneously with
the execution of this Lease,  Lessee shall execute the  subordination  Agreement
attached hereto as an Exhibit.  In confirmation  of such  subordination,  Lessee
shall execute  promptly any certificate  that Lessor may request.  Lessee hereby
constitutes  and appoints  Lessor the Lessee's  attorney-in-fact  to execute any
such  certificate  or  certificates  for and on behalf of Lessee.  Lessee  shall
attorn to any  successor  Lessor  under such ground or  underlying  lease or the
holder of any such  mortgage or the  purchaser  of the  leasehold  or  mortgaged
premises in foreclosure of any subsequent  owner of the fee, as the case may be,
as  Lessee's  lessor  hereunder  in the event that any of them shall  succeed to
Lessor's  interest  in the  Demised  Premises  and in the  event  that  any such
successor lessor shall so require.


         19. Condemnation.

         (a) Lessee agrees that if the whole Demised Premises or any part of all
of the land and/or Building on or in which Demised Premises are located,  or any
substantial  portion  thereof  which renders the Demised  Premises  untenantable
shall be taken or  condemned  for  public or quasi  public use or purpose by any
competent  authority,  then  at the  option  of the  Lessor,  this  Lease  shall
terminate  from date of such taking or  condemnation,  and Lessee  shall have no
claim against Lessor for the value of any unexpired  term of this Lease.  In the
event of a taking,  Lessee  shall not have any claim or rights to any portion of
the  amount  that  may  be  awarded  as  damages  or  paid  as a  result  of any
condemnation  other than Lessee's right to recover moving  expenses and an award
for Lessee's business fixtures from the condemning  authority (or Lessor if same
be awarded Lessor) and all other rights of Lessee to damages, if any, are hereby
assigned  by  Lessee to Lessor  other  than  Lessee's  right to  recover  moving
expenses  and an award  for  Lessee's  business  fixtures  from  the  condemning
authority (or Lessor if same be awarded Lessor).

         (b) If only a portion of the Demised Premises is taken by condemnation,
and Lessor has not given notice that this Lease is  terminated,  then this Lease
shall  remain in full  force and  effect  except  that on the date of Taking the
Basic Rent set forth in  Paragraph 1 above shall be reduced by an amount that is
in the same  ratio to the Basic Rent as the total  number of square  feet in the
Demised  Premises  taken bears to the total number of square feet in the Demised
Premises immediately prior to the Taking.


         20. Holdover.  In the event that Lessee shall not immediately surrender
the  Demised  Premises  at the end of the Term,  then Lessor may, at its option,
elect to treat the Lessee as a month-to-month tenant at twice the monthly rental
being  paid by  Tenant  for the last  month of the  Term.  Lessee,  as a monthly
tenant, shall be subject to all conditions and covenants of this Lease as though
the same had originally  been a monthly  tenancy;  and said Lessee shall give to
Lessor at least thirty (30) days'  written  notice of any intention to quit said
premises, and Lessee



                                       10
<PAGE>
shall be  entitled to thirty (30) days'  written  notice to quit said  premises,
except in the event of a breach of this Lease by said Lessee.  In the event that
Lessee holds over after the expiration of the Term, and Lessor desires to regain
possession of the Demised  Premises at expiration of the Term,  then at any time
prior to Lessor's  acceptance of rent from Lessee as a monthly tenant hereunder,
Lessor, at its option,  may forthwith reenter and take possession of the Demised
Premises with or without process,  in the manner set forth in Paragraph 16 above
the extent applicable.


         21. Possession.

         (a) If Lessor shall be unable to give possession of Demised Premises on
the date of  commencement  of the Term by reason of the fact that  premises  are
located  in a Building  being  constructed  and which has not been  sufficiently
completed to make the premises ready for occupancy or by reason of the fact that
a certificate  of occupancy has not been obtained or if Lessor is unable to give
possession of Demised Premises on the date of commencement of the Term by reason
of holding over or retention of  possession  of any tenant,  or occupant,  or if
repairs,  improvements or decoration of the Demised Premises, or the Building of
which the Demised  Premises  form a part,  are not  completed,  or for any other
reason,  then the rent  reserved  and  covenanted  to be paid  herein  shall not
commence  until  possession  of the Demised  Premises  is given,  or the Demised
Premises  are  sufficiently  complete  to permit  the  Lessee to occupy  same or
install Lessee's own improvements, and no such failure to give possession on the
date of  commencement of the term shall in any other respect affect the validity
of this  Lease  or the  obligations  of  Lessee  hereunder,  nor  shall  same be
construed in any way to extend the term of this Lease beyond the expiration date
set out in Paragraph 1 hereof or subject the Lessor to any liability for failure
to give  possession.  If such delay  shall  continue  for more than one  hundred
twenty (120) days, then Lessee may, within ten (10) days after the expiration of
said one  hundred  twenty  (120) day period,  give Lessor  notice of election to
terminate this Lease.  Unless  possession of the Demised  Premises shall be made
available to Lessee  within ten (10) days of the date of such notice,  then this
Lease shall  terminate  on the tenth  (10th) day after the giving of such notice
and Lessor shall return to Lessee any consideration paid in connection with this
Lease.  Lessor shall have no obligation to Lessee for failure to give possession
except as provided herein.

         (b) If  permission  is given to Lessee to enter into the  possession of
the Demised Premise or to occupy premises other than the Demised  Premises prior
to the date  specified  as the  commencement  of the term of this Lease,  Lessee
covenants  and agrees  that such  occupancy  shall be deemed to be under all the
terms, covenants,  conditions, and provisions of this Lease. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, if any delay in giving possession is caused by Lessee or by the delay
in the completion of any improvement to be made or installed by Lessee, the rent
shall commence at the time of commencement set forth in Paragraph 1.

         22.  Notices.  Any notice  which under the Terms of this Lease or under
any statute must or may be given shall be in writing and shall be deemed to have
been given when deposited in the United States mails and sent  registered  mail,
return receipt requested, postage prepaid, addressed to the respective addresses
of the  parties  hereinafter  given.  Either  party may  designate  by notice in
writing a new or other  address to which such  notice or demand  shall be given.
Said  notices  shall be  addressed  as follows  until  otherwise  designated  in
writing:

          As to Lessor:

          Westport Bank & Trust
          1300 Post Road
          Fairfield, CT 06430


         23. Quiet  Enjoyment.  Upon Lessee paying the rent and additional  rent
and observing and performing all the terms, covenants and conditions on Lessee's
part to be observed and  performed,  Lessee may  peaceably and quietly enjoy the
premises hereby demised free from any  interference,  molestation or acts of the
Lessor,   or  anyone  claiming  by,  through  or  under  the  Lessor,   subject,
nevertheless, to the terms and conditions of this Lease and to any ground lease,
underlying lease and mortgages.

         24.  Brokers.  Lessee  warrants and  represents it has not had or dealt
with any realtor,  broker,  or agent, in connection with the negotiation of this
Lease and agrees to pay and to hold Lessor  harmless  from any cost,  expense or
liability  (including  costs of suit and  reasonable  attorney's  fees)  for any
compensation, commission or charges claimed by any realtor, broker or agent with
respect to this Lease and the negotiation thereof.

         25. Force Majuer. Lessor shall not be liable or in default hereunder if
Lessor is unable or fails to  fulfill or is  delayed  in  fulfilling  any of its
obligations hereunder,  including, without limitation, any obligations to supply
any  service  hereunder,  or any  obligation  to make  repairs  or  replacements
hereunder,  is  prevented  from  fulfilling  or is  delayed in  fulfilling  such
obligations  by reason of fire or other  casualty,  strikes  or labor  troubles,
governmental  pre-emption in connection with a national  emergency,  shortage of
supplies or  materials,  or by reason of any rule,  order or  regulation  of any
governmental  authority,  or by reason of the  condition  of supply  and  demand
affected by war or other emergency,  or any other cause beyond its control. Such
inability  or delay by Lessor in  fulfilling  any of its  obligations  hereunder
shall not affect,  impair or excuse the other party hereto from the  performance
of  any  of  the  terms,  covenants,  conditions,   limitations,  provisions  or
agreements hereunder on its part to be performed, nor result in any abatement of
rents or additional rents payable hereunder.

         26. Estoppel Certificate. Upon request of the Lessor, the Lessee shall
execute and deliver to the Lessor, an instrument prepared by the Lessor stating,
if the same be true,  that  this  Lease is a true and  exact  copy of the  lease
between the parties hereto, that there are no amendments hereof (or stating what
amendments  there may be),  that the same is then in full  force and  effect and
that, to the best of Lessee's knowledge,  there are then no offsets, defenses or
counterclaims  with respect to the payment of rent reserved  hereunder or in the
performance of the other terms,  covenants and conditions  hereof on the part of
the  Lessee  to be  performed,  and  that as of such  date no  default  has been
declared hereunder by either party hereto and that the Lessee at the time has no
knowledge of any facts or circumstances  which it might reasonably believe would
give rise to a default by either party.


         27. Security Deposit.

         (a) The Lessee has  deposited  the sum of Five  Thousand  Nine  Hundred
Fifty-Seven and 34/100 ($5,957.34) Dollars to secure the faithful performance of
all the terms and  conditions  of this Lease and any renewal term. If the Lessee
shall have  complied  with all the terms,  conditions  and  obligations  of this
Lease,  such deposit shall be returned to the Lessee at the  termination of this
Lease or any renewal  thereof,  without  interest.  In the event of the Lessee's
default hereunder, such deposit may be applied by the Lessor toward reduction of
his  damages  without  barring the Lessor in any manner  whatever  from other or
additional  legal or equitable  course.  Such deposit  shall not be construed as
constituting liquidated damages. Lessor shall


                                12
<PAGE>
always  have the right to apply said  deposit,  or from time to time such one or
more  parts or  portions  thereof  or part or  portion  thereof  not  previously
applied, to the curing of any default that may then exist,  without prejudice to
any other remedy or remedies  which the Lessor may have on account  thereof.  In
the event that Lessor does so apply any portion or part of said  deposit,  or in
the event the Basic Rent due hereunder is increased  for any reason  whatsoever,
including but not limited to cost of living increases or Renewal premiums,  upon
request  Lessee shall  forthwith pay to Lessor any amount  required to bring the
security  deposit up to and equal with one (1) months then Basic  Rent,  so that
Lessor shall have a full  deposit  equal to one (1) months Basic Rent on hand at
all times during the term of this Lease.


         (b) If the Lessor conveys its interest  under this Lease,  the deposit,
or the part or portion thereof not previously so applied,  may be turned over by
the Lessor to the Lessor's grantee or assignee;  and, if the same be turned over
as aforesaid,  the Lessee hereby  releases the Lessor from any and all liability
with  respect to the  deposit or its  application  or  return,  provided  Lessor
deliveries to Lessee said grantee's or assignee's  assumption of the obligations
with respect to said security.


         28. Insurance.

         (a) During the term of this Lease,  the Lessee shall,  at its sole cost
and expense, obtain general public liability insurance,  with limits of at least
$1,000,000/  $1,000,000 in case of bodily injury or death,  and  $1,000,000  for
property  damage.  Such policy shall name the Lessor and Lessee as the insureds,
and within ten (10) days from the date hereof,  the Lessee shall  deliver to the
Lessor a certificate  of insurance,  certifying  that such  insurance is in full
force and effect. All notices of cancellation or amendment shall be delivered to
Lessor.

         (b) Lessee at its own cost shall maintain on all its personal property,
Lessee's  improvements and alterations,  in, on, or about the Demised Premises a
policy of standard  fire and extended  coverage  insurance,  with  vandalism and
malicious  mischief  endorsements,  to the  extent of at least 80% of their full
replacement value. The proceeds from any such policy shall be used by Lessee for
the replacement of personal property,  the restoration of Lessee's  improvements
or  alterations.  Such policy shall name the Lessor and Lessee as insureds,  and
within  ten (10) days from the date  hereof,  the  Lessee  shall  deliver to the
Lessor a certificate  of insurance,  certifying  that such  insurance is in full
force and effect. All notices of cancellation or amendment shall be delivered to
Lessor.  "Full Replacement  Value" as used in this paragraph shall be determined
by the company issuing the insurance  policy at the time the policy is initially
obtained. Not more frequently than once every three years, the Lessor shall have
the  right  to  notify  Lessee  that it  elects  to have the  Replacement  Value
redetermined by an insurance company. The redetermination shall be made promptly
and in accordance with the rules and practices of the Board of Fire Underwriters
or a like board recognized and generally accepted by the insurance company,  and
each party  shall  promptly  be  notified  of the  results by the  company.  The
insurance policy shall be adjusted according to any such redetermination.

         29.  Lessor.  The term "Lessor" shall mean the owner for the time being
of the Demised Premises or the Building of which the Demised Premises are a part
and the land on which it stands;  and if such land and Building or lease be sold
or  transferred,  the  seller or  assignor  shall be  entirely  relieved  of all
covenants  and  obligations  under this  Lease;  and it shall be deemed  without
further  agreement  between the  parties  hereto and their  successors  that the
purchaser  on such sale has  assumed and agreed to carry out all  covenants  and
obligations of Lessor hereunder.  Neither Lessor nor any partner or principal of
Lessor  shall  be  under  any  personal  liability  with  respect  to any of the
provisions of this Lease and if Lessor is otherwise under this

                                       13
<PAGE>
Lease, Lessee shall look solely to the equity of Lessor in the Building of which
the Demised Premises are a part for the satisfaction of lessee's remedies. It is
expressly  understood and agreed that the liability of Lessor and any partner or
principal  of Lessor  under the terms,  covenants,  conditions,  warranties  and
obligations  of this Lease shall in no event exceed the loss of Lessor's  equity
interest in said Building.

         30. Future Improvements.  Lessor shall have the right from time to time
to construct other Buildings or improvements in the parking and common areas, to
change the location or character of and to make  modifications,  alterations  or
additions to the Building which the Demised  Premises are located or parking and
common areas,  and entrances and exits,  and to repair and reconstruct the same.
All space, areas and facilities,  not within the Demised Premises,  which tenant
may be permitted to use and/or  occupy,  are to be used and/or  occupied under a
revocable license,  and if any such license be revoked, or if the amount of such
space,  areas and/or  facilities be diminished,  this Lease shall remain in full
force  and  effect  and  Lessor  shall not be  subject  to any  compensation  or
diminution  of  rent,  nor  shall  such   revocation  or  diminution  be  deemed
constructive  or actual  eviction.  The  Lessor  reserves a right to at any time
build  additional  stories on the  Building of which the  Demised  Premises is a
part,  or to build  additions and  enlargements  to any part of said Building or
parking area.


         31. Gender.  Feminine or neuter pronouns shall be substituted for those
of the  masculine  form,  and the plural shall be  substituted  for the singular
number,  in any place or  places  herein  which the  context  may  require  such
substitution. Lessor herein for convenience has been referred to in neuter form.

         32. Assignment and Subletting.

         (a) Lessee shall not voluntarily, involuntarily or by operation of law,
assign,  transfer,  mortgage or  otherwise  encumber all or any part of Lessee's
interest  in this Lease or in the  Demised  Premises  or sublet the whole or any
part of the Demised  Premises without first obtaining in each and every instance
the prior written consent of Lessor,  which consent shall be at the uncontrolled
discretion  of Lessor.  The consent by Lessor to any  assignment  or  subletting
shall  not  constitute  a  waiver  of the  necessity  for  such  consent  to any
subsequent  assignment  or  subletting.  Payment of rentals due hereunder by any
party other than the Lessee named herein shall not be deemed to act as a consent
to the  assignment  of this Lease or the  subletting of the whole or any part of
the Demised  Premises to such party nor relieve Lessee of its obligations to pay
the rentals provided for in this Lease.

         (b) In the event that Lessee is a corporation, any dissolution, merger,
consolidation or other reorganization of such corporation,  or the sale or other
transfer of any of the corporate stock of Lessee, shall constitute an assignment
of this Lease for all purposes of this  Paragraph 32. If any  assignment is made
as aforesaid, then Lessee shall so notify Lessor and Lessor shall have the right
at its option to terminate this Lease upon five (5) days notice to Lessee.

         (c) In the event that Lessor  shall  agree to any  transfer of Lessee's
interest  in this  Lease,  then the term Lessee  shall  thereafter  be deemed to
include,  without  further  reference,  the  party  to whom  such  interest  was
transferred, which is, for example, without limiting the generality thereof, any
subtenant, assignee,  concessionaire or licensee. If the Lease be assigned or if
the  Demised  Premises  or any part  thereof be  occupied  by anyone  other than
Lessee,  Lessor may collect rent from the  assignee or other  occupant and apply
the net amount  collected to the rent herein  reserved,  but no such  assignment
underletting  occupancy or collection shall be deemed a waiver of this provision
or the  acceptance  of the  assignee  under tenant or occupant as Lessee or as a
release of Lessee from further


                                       14
<PAGE>
performance by Lessee of the provisions on its part to be observed and performed
under  this  Lease.  In the  event of any  assignment  of this  Lease  made with
Lessor's consent, Lessee shall, nevertheless,  remain liable for the performance
of all the terms,  covenants and  conditions of this Lease and shall require any
assignee to execute and deliver to Lessor, an assumption of liability  agreement
in form  satisfactory to Lessor,  including an assumption by the assignee of all
the obligations of Lessee and the assignee's  ratification of an agreement to be
bound by all the provisions of this Lease.

         33.  Successors and Assigns.  All rights,  obligations  and liabilities
herein given to or imposed upon the  respective  parties  hereto shall extend to
and  bind  the  several  and  respective   heirs,   executors,   administrators,
successors,  subtenants, licensees,  concessionaires and assigns of said parties
except as  expressly  provided in  Paragraph  29 above and if here shall be more
than one Lessee,  they shall all be bound  jointly and  severally  by the terms,
covenants,  conditions  and  agreements  herein and the word  "Lessee"  shall be
deemed and taken to mean each and every  person or party  mentioned  as a lessee
herein be the same one or more, and if there shall be more than one lessee,  any
notice  required or  permitted  by the terms of this Lease may be given by or to
any one of them. No rights,  however, shall inure to the benefit of any assignee
of Lessee unless the  assignment to such assignee has been approved by Lessor in
writing as aforesaid.

         34.  Renewal  Option.  At the  expiration  of the initial term, if this
Lease  shall then be in full force and effect and if Lessee has fully  performed
all of the terms and conditions of this Lease, then Lessee shall have the option
to  extend  this  Lease,  upon the same  terms  and  conditions,  excepting  the
provision for rent,  for First  extended term of five (5) years,  to commence on
May 01, 2000 and to end on April 30,  2005.  The option for such  extended  term
shall be exercised by the Lessee by giving written notice to the Lessor not less
than  nine (9)  months,  and not more  than  twelve  (12)  months,  prior to the
expiration of the then current  term.  Such extended term shall be upon the same
conditions as provided in this Lease, except that there shall be no privilege to
extend the term of this Lease for any period of time  beyond the  expiration  of
the extended term and except that the Basic Rent for said extended term shall be
at the  initial  rate of $24.50  per  square  foot and  $1,250.00  for the Drive
Through  payable  monthly  in  advance  in  equal  installments,  and all  other
provisions for additional rent and rent adjustment contained in this Lease shall
apply during the extended  term.  The Basic Rent shall  increase $.50 per square
foot for each year of the renewal term. The Drive Through Rent shall be constant
at $1,250.00 per month. The lessee shall have two additional  renewal options of
five (5) years each at a rent to be determined,  but in no event,  less than the
tenth year of this lease. 

         35. Miscellaneous Provisions.
          
         (a) The captions of the  paragraphs  of this Lease are for  convenience
only and shall not be  considered  or  referred  to in  resolving  questions  of
interpretation or construction.

         (b) Printed  parts of this Lease  shall be as binding  upon the parties
hereto as the other  parts  hereof.  Parts of this  Lease  which are  written or
typewritten  shall have no greater  force or effect than and shall control parts
which are printed, but all parts shall be given equal effect.
          
         (c) Lessee  declares that Lessee has read and understands all the parts
of this Lease including all printed parts hereof. If Lessee shall default in the
performance  of any  covenant  required to be  performed by virtue of any of the
provisions of this Lease, Lessor may, as hereinbefore provided, perform the same
for the account of Lessee. If Lessor, at any time, is compelled to pay or elects
to pay any sum of money or do any acts which  would  require  the payment of any
sum of money by reason of the failure of Lessee to comply with any  provision of
this  Lease,  or if  Lessor  is  compelled  to incur any  expense,  including  a
reasonable attorneys' fees, in instituting,  prosecuting or defending any action
or proceeding  instituted by reason of any default of Lessee hereunder,  the sum
or sums so paid by Lessor with all  interest,  costs and damages shall be deemed
to be  additional  rent  hereunder and shall be due from Lessee to Lessor on the
first day of the month  following  the  incurring  of such  respective  expenses
except as otherwise specifically provided above. If Lessee is compelled to incur
any expense,  including reasonable attorneys' fees, in instituting,  prosecuting
or defending  any action or  proceeding  instituted  by reason of any default of
Lessor hereunder,  the sum or sums so paid by Lessee,  with all interest,  costs
and damages  shall be due and payable  from Lessor to Lessee on the first day of
the month following the incurring of such expense. Any sum accruing to Lessor or
Lessee under the terms and provisions of this Lease which shall not be paid when
due,  shall bear interest at the rate of two points above the then current prime
rate of interest as determined by  Connecticut  Bank and Trust  Company,  or the
highest legal rate of interest which is payable by law,  whichever is less, from
the date when the same  becomes  due and  payable  by the  terms and  provisions
hereof until paid.

         (e)  This  Lease  and  the  exhibits,  riders  and/or  addenda,  if any
attached,  contain  all  covenants  and  agreements  between  Lessor  and Lessee
relating in any manner to the rental use and  occupancy of the Demised  Premises
and  the  other  matters  set  forth  in  this  Lease.  No  prior  agreement  or
understanding  pertaining  to the same  shall be valid or of any force or effect
and the  covenants  and  agreements  of this Lease  cannot be altered,  changed,
modified  or added  to,  except in  writing  signed by  Lessor  and  Lessee.  No
representation,  inducement,  understanding or anything of any nature whatsoever
made,  stated or  represented  on Lessor's  behalf,  either orally or in writing

                                       15

(except this Lease), has induced Lessee to enter into this Lease. The submission
of this  document for  examination  does not  constitute  an offer to lease or a
reservation  of an option for the Demised  Premises and becomes  effective  only
upon execution and delivery thereof by Lessor to Lessee.

         (f) Any  provision or  provisions of this Lease which shall prove to be
invalid,  void or illegal shall in no way affect, impair or invalidate any other
provision hereof and the remaining  provisions hereof shall nevertheless  remain
in full force and effect.

         (g)  Any  default  by  Lessee  under  any  instrument,  undertaking  or
agreement  executed by Lessee in favor of or with Lessor  relating to this Lease
or the  tenancy  created  hereby,  shall  constitute  a breach of this Lease and
entitle  Lessor to pursue each and all of its rights and remedies  hereunder and
at law.

         (h)  Lessee's  failure to object to any  statement,  invoice or billing
rendered  by  Lessor  within a period of ninety  (90) days of  Lessee's  receipt
thereof shall constitute  Lessee's  acquiescence  with respect thereto and shall
render such  statement,  invoice or billing an account stated between Lessor and
Lessee.

         (i) Exhibit A (Plan).

         (j)  Lessee has  examined  the  premises  and  accepts  them in "as is"
condition.  Further,  lessee shall perform all tenant  improvements  at its sole
cost and expense and shall obtain all necessary permits for same.

         (k) The tenant shall have dedicated  parking (four (4) spaces) directly
to the rear of the premises as well as parking in common with other tenants.

         (l) It is understood and agreed that this lease is contingent  upon the
Landlord  obtaining a release of the current lease to Gateway Bank ( now Shawmut
Bank) which the Landlord agrees to pursue with due diligence.
     
         IN WITENESS WHEREOF,  the above parties have executed this Lease on the
day and year above written.

forthwith apply for such approval and to diligently pursue its application.

location and taking possession of the premises for fit-up work.

38. Wheresoever herein the Lessor's consent is required,  such consent shall not
be unreasonably withheld.

                                    AMENDMENT
                                    ---------

         This Amendment to an existing  employment  agreement is made as of this
13th day of November,  1995, by and among THE WESTPORT BANK & TRUST  COMPANY,  a
Connecticut-chartered state bank and trust company having its principal place of
business  in the  Town of  Westport,  Connecticut  ("Westport  Bank"),  WESTPORT
BANCORP,  INC., a Delaware  corporation owning all of the issued and outstanding
shares of capital stock of the Bank  ("Westport  Bancorp");  (Westport  Bank and
Westport Bancorp are collectively referred to herein as the "Bank"), and Michael
H. Flynn,  an  individual  residing in the Town of Fairfield,  Connecticut  (the
"Executive").

                              W I T N E S S E T H:

         WHEREAS,  the Bank entered into an  Employment  Agreement  ("Employment
Agreement") with the Executive on August 31, 1989; and

         WHEREAS,  the Board of Directors of Westport Bank and Westport  Bancorp
(collectively  the  "Board")  and the  Executive  wish to amend  the  Employment
Agreement to extend the period after  termination of employment during which the
Bank will continue certain employee benefits to Executive; and

         WHEREAS,  the  Board  and  the  Executive  further  wish to  amend  the
Employment  Agreement to provide the  Executive  with a so called "tax gross up"
for any excise taxes which might be levied under  Sections  280G and 4999 of the
Internal  Revenue Code of 1986, as amended in the event of a "change of control"
of the Bank; and

         WHEREAS,  the  Board of  Directors  of  Westport  Bank and the Board of
Directors of Westport Bancorp have each by the affirmative vote of a majority of
the  members  of each said  Board  approved  the  amendments  to the  Employment
Agreement as required by Section 12(c) thereof; and

         WHEREAS,  a re-examination of the Employment  Agreement revealed a need
to correct references in parts of said Agreement.

         NOW,  THEREFORE,  in consideration of the mutual covenants  hereinafter
set forth, the parties hereto agree as follows:

1.       The  November  18,  1994  amendment  to  the  Employment  Agreement  is
         rescinded and shall be of no further force and effect.

2.       The three references in subsection (e) of Section 9 to Section 9(e) are
         hereby changed and corrected to read Section 9(d).


                                                                              1

<PAGE>


3.       The phrase  "(subject to the  limitations in Section 9(g) below)" as it
         appears in Section 9(d) of the Employment Agreement is deleted.

4.       Subsection (f) of Section 9 of the  Employment  Agreement is deleted in
         its entirety and the following substituted in its place:

                  "(f) If, in the event of a change in control of the Bank,  the
                  benefits  provided  by  Section  11 and  Section  9(d) of this
                  Agreement,  (or, if by reason of the amount of such  benefits,
                  any other  amount in the  nature of  compensation  payable  to
                  Executive ("Other  Compensation")) is determined to be subject
                  to the excise tax  imposed  by Section  4999 of the Code,  the
                  Bank shall pay to Executive, as additional  compensation,  the
                  amount  necessary to cause the total  payments  (including the
                  additional  payment  required  under  this  Section  9(f)) and
                  benefits  received  by  Executive  under  Section 9 and 11 and
                  Executive's  Other  Compensation (net of all federal and state
                  taxes,  including  all taxes payable under Section 4999 of the
                  Code) to be equal to the total payments and benefits Executive
                  would have  received  under  Section 9 and 11 and  Executive's
                  Other Compensation (net of all federal, state and local taxes)
                  if Section 4999 of the Code had not applied."

5.       Section 11 of the  Employment  Agreement is deleted in its entirety and
         the following substituted in its place:

                  "11. Certain Benefits Upon Termination.  Provided  Executive's
                  employment is terminated for other then cause,  the Bank shall
                  maintain  in full force and effect for  Executive's  continued
                  benefit from the date of  termination  of his  employment  and
                  thereafter   for  a  period  of  three  years  the  basic  and
                  corporate-owned life insurance,  (except in the life insurance
                  policy  described in Section 4(b) above)  accidental death and
                  dismemberment insurance, dental, health, and disability plans,
                  programs or  arrangements  in which  Executive was entitled to
                  participate  immediately prior to the date of termination,  to
                  the same extent as if Executive continued to be an employee of
                  the Bank  during the three year period  following  the date of
                  termination.  The Bank shall  continue  to pay the cost of any
                  benefits  provided under this Section 11;  provided,  however,
                  the Bank and  Executive  shall  share  the cost of the  health
                  plan,  program,  or arrangement and each shall pay the portion
                  which each would have paid if  Executive  was  employed by the
                  Bank.  Any benefits  provided  under this Section 11, shall be
                  reduced  or  offset  to  the  extent  they  are   replaced  by
                  substantially  similar  benefits  provided by a new  employer.
                  Termination  for  cause  shall  mean  termination  because  of
                  Executive's   personal   dishonesty,   incompetence,   willful
                  misconduct,   breach  of  fiduciary  duty  involving  personal
                  profit, intentional failure to perform material stated duties,
                  willful  violation of any law, rule, or regulation (other than
                  traffic    violations   or   similar    offenses)   or   final
                  cease-and-desist order, the violation of which has

                                                                             2


<PAGE>

                  a  material  effect on the  Bank,  or  material  breach of any
                  provision of this Agreement. In determining incompetence,  the
                  acts  or  omissions  shall  be  measured   against   standards
                  generally  prevailing  in  the  commercial  banking  industry;
                  provided,  it shall be the Bank's  burden to prove the alleged
                  acts and omissions and the prevailing  nature of the standards
                  the Bank shall have  alleged are  violated by such acts and/or
                  omissions."

Except as amended by this  Amendment,  the Employment  Agreement is ratified and
confirmed as originally  signed (with the Stock Option Plan and  Agreement  made
effective  December  17,  1992,  substituted  for the August 31, 1989 version in
Exhibit A, as was effected in 1993).

         IN WITNESS  WHEREOF,  the parties hereto have set their hands and seals
on the day first above written.

         WHEREAS,  the Bank entered into an  Employment  Agreement  ("Employment

         WHEREAS,  the Board of Directors of Westport Bank and Westport  Bancorp
(collectively  the  "Board")  and the  Executive  wish to amend  the  Employment
Agreement to extend the period after  termination of employment during which the
Bank will continue certain employee benefits to Executive; and

         WHEREAS,  the  Board  and  the  Executive  further  wish to  amend  the
Employment  Agreement to provide the  Executive  with a so called "tax gross up"
for any excise taxes which might be levied under  Sections  280G and 4999 of the
Internal  Revenue Code of 1986, as amended in the event of a "change of control"
of the Bank; and

         WHEREAS,  the  Board of  Directors  of  Westport  Bank and the Board of
Directors of Westport Bancorp have each by the affirmative vote of a majority of
the  members  of each said  Board  approved  the  amendments  to the  Employment
Agreement as required by Section 12(c) thereof.

         NOW,  THEREFORE,  in consideration of the mutual covenants  hereinafter

                  Agreement,  (or, if by reason of the amount of such  benefits,
                  any other  amount in the  nature of  compensation  payable  to
                  Executive ("Other  Compensation")) is determined to be subject
                  to the excise tax  imposed  by Section  4999 of the Code,  the
                  Bank shall pay to Executive, as additional  compensation,  the
                  amount  necessary to cause the total  payments  (including the
                  additional  payment  required  under  this  Section  9(f)) and
                  benefits  received by  Executive  under  Sections 9 and 11 and

                  taxes,  including  all taxes payable under Section 4999 of the
                  Code) to be equal to the total payments and benefits Executive
                  would have  received  under  Section 9 and 11 and  Executive's
                  Other Compensation (net of all federal, state and local taxes)
                  if Section 4999 of the Code had not applied."


3.       Section 11 of the  Employment  Agreement is deleted in its entirety and
         the following substituted in its place:

                  "11. Certain Benefits Upon Termination.  Provided  Executive's
                  employment is terminated for other then cause,  the Bank shall
                  maintain  in full force and effect for  Executive's  continued
                  benefit from the date of  termination  of his  employment  and
                  thereafter   for  a  period  of  three  years  the  basic  and
                  corporate-owned   life   insurance,   accidental   death   and
                  dismemberment insurance, dental, health, and disability plans,
                  programs or  arrangements  in which  Executive was entitled to
                  participate  immediately prior to the date of termination,  to
                  the same extent as if Executive continued to be an employee of
                  the Bank  during the three year period  following  the date of
                  termination.  The Bank shall  continue  to pay the cost of any
                  benefits  provided under this Section 11;  provided,  however,
                  the Bank and  Executive  shall  share  the cost of the  health
                  plan,  program,  or arrangement and each shall pay the portion
                  which each would have paid if  Executive  was  employed by the
                  Bank.  Any benefits  provided  under this Section 11, shall be
                  reduced  or  offset  to  the  extent  they  are   replaced  by
                  substantially  similar  benefits  provided by a new  employer.
                  Termination  for  cause  shall  mean  termination  because  of
                  Executive's

                                                                             2

                  determining  incompetence,  the  acts or  omissions  shall  be
                  measured  against  standards   generally   prevailing  in  the

                  maintain  in full force and effect for  Executive's  continued

                  was entitled to participate  immediately  prior to the date of

                  be an  employee  of the Bank  during  the  three  year  period
                  following the date of termination.  The Bank shall continue to
                  pay the cost of any benefits  provided  under this Section 11;
                  provided, however, the Bank and Executive shall share the cost
                  of the health plan, program, or arrangement and each shall pay
                  the  portion  which  each  would  have paid if  Executive  was
                  employed by the Bank. Any benefits provided under this Section
                  11, shall be reduced or offset to the extent they are replaced
                  by substantially  similar benefits provided by a new employer.
                  Termination for cause shall mean termination

                        SPLIT DOLLAR INSURANCE AGREEMENT
                         (COLLATERAL ASSIGNMENT METHOD)


         THIS  AGREEMENT  is entered  into  effective  this 1st day of December,
1995,  by and  between  The  Westport  Bank and  Trust  Company,  a  Connecticut
Chartered State Bank and Trust Company having its principal place of business in
Westport,  Connecticut (hereinafter called "Employer"),  and William B. Laudano,
Jr. (hereinafter called ("Employee").

         WHEREAS,  William B. Laudano, Jr. is a valued Employee of the Employer,
and Employer wishes to provide  additional  inducement for Employee's  continued
employment,  and as additional compensation,  Employer wishes to assist Employee
with a personal life insurance program by entering into a Split Dollar Insurance
Agreement ("Agreement").

         NOW, THEREFORE, Employer and Employee agree as follows:

1.       The life  insurance  Policy with which this  Agreement  deals is Policy
         #VL9202800  (hereinafter  called  "Policy"),  issued by  Hartford  Life
         Insurance Company (hereinafter called "Insurer") on the life of William
         B. Laudano, in the face amount of $268,000.00.

2.       Employee  shall  be the  owner  of the  Policy,  and may  exercise  all
         ownership rights granted to the owner by the terms of the Policy. It is
         the express  intention  of the parties to reserve to the  Employee  all
         rights in the Policy granted by the terms of the Policy, including, but
         not  limited to, the right to borrow  against the Policy,  the right to
         assign the  owner's  interest  in the  Policy,  the right to change the
         beneficiary of the Policy,  the right to exercise  settlement  options,
         and the right to  surrender or cancel the Policy (in whole or in part).
         The Employer shall not have nor exercise any right in and to the Policy
         which could, in any way,  endanger,  defeat or impair any of the rights
         of the  Employee  in the  Policy.  The only rights in and to the Policy
         granted to the  Employer  shall be its  security  interest  in the cash
         value of the  Policy,  as defined  therein,  and its right to receive a
         portion  of the  death  benefit  of the  Policy,  as  provided  in this
         Agreement.  The  Employer  shall not  assign  any of its  rights in the
         Policy to anyone  other than the owner (or the owner's  transferee,  if
         the owner has transferred his rights in the Policy).

3.       Premiums  on the  Policy  shall be paid by the  Employer  and  shall be
         repaid to the Employer as provided in this Agreement.

4.       The  Employee  has,   contemporaneously   with  the  adoption  of  this
         agreement,  assigned the Policy to the Employer as collateral,  under a
         form of  Collateral  Assignment  attached  hereto  as  Exhibit  A.  The
         Employer's interest in the Policy shall be specifically  limited to the
         following  rights  in the cash  value  and to a  portion  of the  death
         benefit:

                                                                               1

(a)      Subject to paragraph 10 hereof,  the right to be repaid its  cumulative
         premiums paid or, if less, the net cash surrender  value of the Policy,
         in the event the  Policy is totally  surrendered  or  cancelled  by the
         Employee, or the right to receive the surrender proceeds, to the extent
         of its  cumulative  premiums paid, in the event the Policy is partially
         surrendered  or cancelled by the  Employee,  as provided in paragraph 5
         below .


(b)      Subject to paragraph 10 hereof,  the right to be repaid its  cumulative
         premiums paid upon the death of the Employee,  as provided in Paragraph
         6 below.

(c)      Subject to < paragraph 10 hereof, the right to be repaid its cumulative
         premiums paid or, if less, the net cash surrender  value of the Policy,
         or to receive  ownership of the Policy, in the event of the termination
         of this Agreement, as provided in paragraphs 8 and 9 below.

(d)      The right to be repaid a portion of its  cumulative  premiums paid if a
         Policy  loan or partial  withdrawal  made by the  Employee  in any year
         causes the net cash surrender value of the Policy to be a sum less than
         the Employer's  cumulative  premiums paid. In such case,  Employee will
         use a portion of any Policy  loan  proceeds  or partial  withdrawal  to
         reduce the cumulative  premiums paid by the Employer so as to cause the
         net cash surrender  value to be equal to or greater than the Employer's
         cumulative premiums paid. As used in this Agreement, the term "net cash
         surrender value" means the cash surrender value of the Policy, less the
         amount of any then  existing  loans or  withdrawals  against the Policy
         obtained by the Employee pursuant to this paragraph.

5.       The  Employee  shall  have the sole  right to  surrender  or cancel the
         Policy  (in whole or in part).  In the  event of a total  surrender  or
         cancellation by the Employee,  the Employer shall be entitled  (subject
         to paragraph 10 hereof) to receive the then outstanding  balance of its
         cumulative  premiums paid or, if less, the net cash surrender  value of
         the Policy.

6.       Upon the death of the Employee, the Employer shall be entitled (subject
         to  paragraph  10 hereof)  to  receive a portion  of the death  benefit
         provided under the Policy equal to the then outstanding  balance of its
         cumulative  premiums  paid.  The balance of the death benefit  provided
         under the Policy,  if any, shall be paid directly to the beneficiary or
         beneficiaries  designated  by the  Employee,  in the  manner and in the
         amounts provided by the beneficiary designation of the Policy.


                                                                               2

7.       This  Agreement  may  be  terminated,  subject  to  the  provisions  of
         Paragraphs 8 and 9 below,  by either  party,  with consent of the other
         party, by giving notice in writing to the other party.

8.       In the event of  termination of this Agreement as provided in Paragraph
         7 above,  the Employee  shall repay to the  Employer,  within sixty (60
         days) of the date of termination,  the then outstanding  balance of its
         cumulative premiums paid hereunder,  or if less, the net cash surrender
         value of the Policy,  unless  said  amount is not  payable  pursuant to
         paragraph 10 hereof.  Upon receipt of this amount,  the Employer  shall
         execute an  appropriate  release of its  Collateral  Assignment  of the
         Policy.

9.       If the Employee fails to repay the Employer the amount specified in and
         payable  under  paragraph 8 above within sixty (60) days of the date of
         termination  of the  Agreement  (unless  said  amount  is  not  payable
         pursuant to paragraph 10 hereof),  the Employee  shall  execute any and
         all instruments that may be required to vest ownership of the Policy in
         the Employer.  Thereafter,  the Employee shall have no further interest
         in the Policy or in this Agreement.

10.      In the event the  Employee's  employment is  terminated  for any reason
         other  than cause (as that term is  defined  in  paragraph  8(a) of the
         Employee's  Employment Agreement with the Employer),  or the Employee's
         employment  is  terminated  after a change  of  control  as a result of
         actual or  constructive  termination  (as those  terms are  defined  in
         paragraph  9(b)  of  the  Employee's   Employment  Agreement  with  the
         Employer), then, in that event, notwithstanding any other provisions in
         this Agreement to the contrary,  this Agreement shall terminate and the
         Employer  shall charge to the Employee as additional  compensation  the
         cumulative  premiums paid by the Employer  pursuant to the terms of the
         Policy and shall  execute  an  appropriate  release  of its  Collateral
         Assignment of the Policy.

11.      The  Employee  shall have the sole right to borrow  against the Policy,
         and the  Employer  shall  have no right to  obtain  loans  against  the
         Policy,  directly or indirectly,  from the insurer or any other person,
         or pledge or assign the Policy as security for any loan.

12.      In the event the Employee  shall transfer all interest in the Policy to
         a transferee,  then all of the Employee's interest in the Policy and in
         this Agreement  shall be vested in the  transferee,  who shall become a
         substituted  party,  and the Employee shall have no further interest in
         the Policy or in this Agreement.

13.      The  Insurer  shall in no way be bound by, or be deemed to have  notice
         of, the provisions of this Agreement.

                                                                               3

                             (COLLATERAL ASSIGNMENT)



         THIS  ASSIGNMENT  is made and  entered  into this 1st day of  December,
1995, by the undersigned as owner of a certain Life Insurance Policy # VL9202800
("Policy") issued by Hartford Life Insurance Company ("Insurer"),  upon the life
of  William  B.  Laudano,  Jr.,  and  The  Westport  Bank & Trust  Company  (the
"Assignee").

         WHEREAS,  William B. Laudano, Jr. is a valued Employee of the Assignee,
and

         WHEREAS,  Employee  has  entered  into a Split  Dollar  Agreement  with
Assignee (the "Agreement"), and

         WHEREAS,  in  consideration  of the  Assignee  agreeing to make premium
payments,  the Employee agrees to grant the Assignee a security  interest in the
Policy as collateral  security for the repayment of cumulative  premiums paid by
the Assignee.

         NOW, THEREFORE, the undersigned Employee hereby assigns,  transfers and
sets over to the Assignee the following specific rights in the Policy subject to
the following terms and conditions:

1.       This  Assignment  is made,  and the Policy is to be held, as collateral
         security for all  liabilities  of the Employee to the Assignee,  either
         now existing or that may hereafter arise,  pursuant to the terms of the
         Agreement.

2.       The Assignee's interest in the Policy shall be strictly limited to:

         (a)      Subject  to  paragraph  10 of the  Agreement,  the right to be
                  repaid a portion of its  cumulative  premiums paid if a Policy
                  loan or partial  withdrawal  made by the  Employee in any year
                  causes the net cash surrender value of Policy to be a sum less
                  than the Employer's cumulative premiums paid.

         (b)      Subject  to  paragraph  10 of the  Agreement,  the right to be
                  repaid its cumulative  premiums paid or, if less, the net cash
                  surrender  value of the  Policy,  in the event  the  Policy is
                  totally  surrendered  or cancelled by the Employee as provided
                  in Paragraph 5 of the Agreement.


                                                                               6
<PAGE>


         (c)      Subject  to  paragraph  10 of the  Agreement,  the right to be
                  repaid its cumulative premiums paid, in the event of the death
                  of the Insured as provided in paragraph 6 of the Agreement.

         (d)      Subject  to  paragraph  10 of the  Agreement,  the right to be
                  repaid its cumulative premiums paid, or, if less, the net cash
                  surrender value of the Policy,  or to receive ownership of the
                  Policy,  in the  event  of  termination  of the  Agreement  as
                  provided in paragraph 8 of the Agreement.

3.       The  Employee  shall  retain all  incidents of ownership in the Policy,
         including, but not limited to, the sole and exclusive rights to: borrow
         against the Policy; make withdrawals from the Policy; assign Employee's
         interest in the Policy; change the beneficiary of the Policy;  exercise
         settlement options; and, surrender or cancel the Policy (in whole or in
         part).  All of these incidents of ownership shall be exercisable by the
         Employee unilaterally and without the consent of any other person.

4.       The Assignee shall, upon request, if the Policy is in the possession of
         the Assignee,  forward the Policy to the Insurer,  without unreasonable
         delay,  for change of  beneficiary,  any  election of optional  mode of
         settlement,  of  the  exercise  of  any  other  right  reserved  by the
         Employee.

5.       The Insurer is hereby  authorized to recognize the Assignee's claims to
         rights for any action taken by the Assignee, the validity or the amount
         of any of the  liabilities  of the Employee to the  Assignee  under the
         Agreement,  the  existence  of any default  therein,  the giving of any
         notice required  herein,  or the application to be made by the Assignee
         of any amounts to be paid to the Assignee.  The receipt of the Assignee
         for any  sums  received  by it shall be a full  discharge  and  release
         therefore to the Insured.

6.       The Insurer shall be fully  protected in  recognizing a request made by
         the Employee for surrender or cancellation  of the Policy,  in whole or
         in part, or in recognizing a request made by the Employee for any loans
         against the Policy  permitted by the terms of the Policy.  In the event
         this  request  is  made,  the  Insurer  may  pay  the  proceeds  of any
         surrender,  cancellation, or loan to the sole order of the Employee, or
         as the Employee shall direct.

7.       Upon  the  full  payment  of the  liabilities  of the  Employee  to the
         Assignee  pursuant  to the  Agreement  or  the  satisfaction  of  these
         liabilities  pursuant to  paragraph 10 of the  Agreement,  the Assignee
         shall execute an appropriate release of this Collateral Assignment.

                                                                               7
<PAGE>
8.       It is the  express  intention  of the  Employee  to  assign  a  limited
         interest in the Policy to the Assignee as Security for certain  premium
         payments  made  by  the  Assignee,  without  giving  the  Assignee  any
         incidents of ownership in the Policy within the meaning of section 2042
         of the  Internal  Revenue  Code (and  regulations  thereunder),  or any
         similar  provision of subsequent law. All provisions of this Collateral
         Assignment  shall be  construed  and  exercised  to as to  effect  that
         intention.

9.       When  the  Agreement  is  terminated  pursuant  to  the  provisions  of
         paragraph 10 of the Agreement,  the cumulative  premiums charged by the
         Assignee  pursuant  to the terms of the Policy  shall be charged to the
         Employee as additional compensation.

         IN WITNESS WHEREOF the Employee has executed this Assignment  effective
the day and year first above written.

                        SPLIT DOLLAR INSURANCE AGREEMENT
                         (COLLATERAL ASSIGNMENT METHOD)


         THIS  AGREEMENT  is entered  into  effective  this 1st day of December,
1995,  by and  between  The  Westport  Bank and  Trust  Company,  a  Connecticut
Chartered State Bank and Trust Company having its principal place of business in
Westport,  Connecticut (hereinafter called "Employer"),  and Richard T. Cummings
(hereinafter called ("Employee").

         WHEREAS,  Richard T. Cummings is a valued Employee of the Employer, and
Employer  wishes to  provide  additional  inducement  for  Employee's  continued
employment,  and as additional compensation,  Employer wishes to assist Employee
with a personal life insurance program by entering into a Split Dollar Insurance
Agreement ("Agreement").

         NOW, THEREFORE, Employer and Employee agree as follows:

1.       The life  insurance  Policy with which this  Agreement  deals is Policy
         #VL9202798  (hereinafter  called  "Policy"),  issued by  Hartford  Life
         Insurance Company (hereinafter called "Insurer") on the life of Richard
         T. Cummings, in the face amount of $277,000.00.

2.       Employee  shall  be the  owner  of the  Policy,  and may  exercise  all
         ownership rights granted to the owner by the terms of the Policy. It is
         the express  intention  of the parties to reserve to the  Employee  all
         rights in the Policy granted by the terms of the Policy, including, but
         not  limited to, the right to borrow  against the Policy,  the right to
         assign the  owner's  interest  in the  Policy,  the right to change the
         beneficiary of the Policy,  the right to exercise  settlement  options,
         and the right to  surrender or cancel the Policy (in whole or in part).
         The Employer shall not have nor exercise any right in and to the Policy
         which could, in any way,  endanger,  defeat or impair any of the rights
         of the  Employee  in the  Policy.  The only rights in and to the Policy
         granted to the  Employer  shall be its  security  interest  in the cash
         value of the  Policy,  as defined  therein,  and its right to receive a
         portion  of the  death  benefit  of the  Policy,  as  provided  in this
         Agreement.  The  Employer  shall not  assign  any of its  rights in the
         Policy to anyone  other than the owner (or the owner's  transferee,  if
         the owner has transferred his rights in the Policy).

3.       Premiums  on the  Policy  shall be paid by the  Employer  and  shall be
         repaid to the Employer as provided in this Agreement.

4.       The  Employee  has,   contemporaneously   with  the  adoption  of  this
         agreement,  assigned the Policy to the Employer as collateral,  under a
         form of  Collateral  Assignment  attached  hereto  as  Exhibit  A.  The
         Employer's interest in the Policy shall be specifically  limited to the
         following  rights  in the cash  value  and to a  portion  of the  death
         benefit:

                                                                             1

<PAGE>

(a)      Subject to paragraph 10 hereof,  the right to be repaid its  cumulative
         premiums paid or, if less, the net cash surrender  value of the Policy,
         in the event the  Policy is totally  surrendered  or  cancelled  by the
         Employee, or the right to receive the surrender proceeds, to the extent
         of its  cumulative  premiums paid, in the event the Policy is partially
         surrendered  or cancelled by the  Employee,  as provided in paragraph 5
         below.

(b)      Subject to paragraph 10 hereof,  the right to be repaid its  cumulative
         premiums paid upon the death of the Employee,  as provided in Paragraph
         6 below.

(c)      Subject to < paragraph 10 hereof, the right to be repaid its cumulative
         premiums paid or, if less, the net cash surrender  value of the Policy,
         or to receive  ownership of the Policy, in the event of the termination
         of this Agreement, as provided in paragraphs 8 and 9 below.

(d)      The right to be repaid a portion of its  cumulative  premiums paid if a
         Policy  loan or partial  withdrawal  made by the  Employee  in any year
         causes the net cash surrender value of the Policy to be a sum less than
         the Employer's  cumulative  premiums paid. In such case,  Employee will
         use a portion of any Policy  loan  proceeds  or partial  withdrawal  to
         reduce the cumulative  premiums paid by the Employer so as to cause the
         net cash surrender  value to be equal to or greater than the Employer's
         cumulative premiums paid. As used in this Agreement, the term "net cash
         surrender value" means the cash surrender value of the Policy, less the
         amount of any then  existing  loans or  withdrawals  against the Policy
         obtained by the Employee pursuant to this paragraph.

5.       The  Employee  shall  have the sole  right to  surrender  or cancel the
         Policy  (in whole or in part).  In the  event of a total  surrender  or
         cancellation by the Employee,  the Employer shall be entitled  (subject
         to paragraph 10 hereof) to receive the then outstanding  balance of its
         cumulative  premiums paid or, if less, the net cash surrender  value of
         the Policy.

6.       Upon the death of the Employee, the Employer shall be entitled (subject
         to  paragraph  10 hereof)  to  receive a portion  of the death  benefit
         provided under the Policy equal to the then outstanding  balance of its
         cumulative  premiums  paid.  The balance of the death benefit  provided
         under the Policy,  if any, shall be paid directly to the beneficiary or
         beneficiaries  designated  by the  Employee,  in the  manner and in the
         amounts provided by the beneficiary designation of the Policy.

         the Policy or in this Agreement.

                             (COLLATERAL ASSIGNMENT)



         THIS  ASSIGNMENT  is made and  entered  into this 1st day of  December,
1995, by the undersigned as owner of a certain Life Insurance Policy  #VL9202798
("Policy") issued by Hartford Life Insurance Company ("Insurer"),  upon the life
of Richard T. Cummings, and The Westport Bank & Trust Company (the "Assignee").

         WHEREAS, Richard T. Cummings is a valued Employee of the Assignee, and

         WHEREAS,  Employee  has  entered  into a Split  Dollar  Agreement  with
Assignee (the "Agreement"), and

         WHEREAS,  in  consideration  of the  Assignee  agreeing to make premium
payments,  the Employee agrees to grant the Assignee a security  interest in the
Policy as collateral  security for the repayment of cumulative  premiums paid by
the Assignee.

         NOW, THEREFORE, the undersigned Employee hereby assigns,  transfers and
sets over to the Assignee the following specific rights in the Policy subject to
the following terms and conditions:

1.       This  Assignment  is made,  and the Policy is to be held, as collateral
         security for all  liabilities  of the Employee to the Assignee,  either
         now existing or that may hereafter arise,  pursuant to the terms of the
         Agreement.

2.       The Assignee's interest in the Policy shall be strictly limited to:

         (a)      Subject  to  paragraph  10 of the  Agreement,  the right to be
                  repaid a portion of its  cumulative  premiums paid if a Policy
                  loan or partial  withdrawal  made by the  Employee in any year
                  causes the net cash surrender value of Policy to be a sum less
                  than the Employer's cumulative premiums paid.

         (b)      Subject  to  paragraph  10 of the  Agreement,  the right to be
                  repaid its cumulative  premiums paid or, if less, the net cash
                  surrender  value of the  Policy,  in the event  the  Policy is
                  totally  surrendered  or cancelled by the Employee as provided
                  in Paragraph 5 of the Agreement.

                                                                             6
<PAGE>
         (c)      Subject  to  paragraph  10 of the  Agreement,  the right to be
                  repaid its cumulative premiums paid, in the event of the death
                  of the Insured as provided in paragraph 6 of the Agreement.

         (d)      Subject  to  paragraph  10 of the  Agreement,  the right to be
                  repaid its cumulative premiums paid, or, if less, the net cash
                  surrender value of the Policy,  or to receive ownership of the
                  Policy,  in the  event  of  termination  of the  Agreement  as
                  provided in paragraph 8 of the Agreement.

3.       The  Employee  shall  retain all  incidents of ownership in the Policy,
         including, but not limited to, the sole and exclusive rights to: borrow
         against the Policy; make withdrawals from the Policy; assign Employee's
         interest in the Policy; change the beneficiary of the Policy;  exercise
         settlement options; and, surrender or cancel the Policy (in whole or in
         part).  All of these incidents of ownership shall be exercisable by the
         Employee unilaterally and without the consent of any other person.

4.       The Assignee shall, upon request, if the Policy is in the possession of
         the Assignee,  forward the Policy to the Insurer,  without unreasonable
         delay,  for change of  beneficiary,  any  election of optional  mode of
         settlement,  of  the  exercise  of  any  other  right  reserved  by the
         Employee.

5.       The Insurer is hereby  authorized to recognize the Assignee's claims to
         rights for any action taken by the Assignee, the validity or the amount
         of any of the  liabilities  of the Employee to the  Assignee  under the
         Agreement,  the  existence  of any default  therein,  the giving of any
         notice required  herein,  or the application to be made by the Assignee
         of any amounts to be paid to the Assignee.  The receipt of the Assignee
         for any  sums  received  by it shall be a full  discharge  and  release
         therefore to the Insured.

6.       The Insurer shall be fully  protected in  recognizing a request made by
         the Employee for surrender or cancellation  of the Policy,  in whole or
         in part, or in recognizing a request made by the Employee for any loans
         against the Policy  permitted by the terms of the Policy.  In the event
         this  request  is  made,  the  Insurer  may  pay  the  proceeds  of any
         surrender,  cancellation, or loan to the sole order of the Employee, or
         as the Employee shall direct.

7.       Upon  the  full  payment  of the  liabilities  of the  Employee  to the
         Assignee  pursuant  to the  Agreement  or  the  satisfaction  of  these
         liabilities  pursuant to  paragraph 10 of the  Agreement,  the Assignee
         shall execute an appropriate release of this Collateral Assignment.

                                                                             7

<PAGE>
8.       It is the  express  intention  of the  Employee  to  assign  a  limited
         interest in the Policy to the Assignee as Security for certain  premium
         payments  made  by  the  Assignee,  without  giving  the  Assignee  any
         incidents of ownership in the Policy within the meaning of section 2042
         of the  Internal  Revenue  Code (and  regulations  thereunder),  or any
         similar  provision of subsequent law. All provisions of this Collateral
         Assignment  shall be  construed  and  exercised  to as to  effect  that
         intention.

9.       When  the  Agreement  is  terminated  pursuant  to  the  provisions  of
         paragraph 10 of the Agreement,  the cumulative  premiums charged by the
         Assignee  pursuant  to the terms of the Policy  shall be charged to the
         Employee as additional compensation.

         IN WITNESS WHEREOF the Employee has executed this Assignment  effective
the day and year first above written.

                        SPLIT DOLLAR INSURANCE AGREEMENT
                         (COLLATERAL ASSIGNMENT METHOD)


         THIS  AGREEMENT  is entered  into  effective  this 1st day of December,
1995,  by and  between  The  Westport  Bank and  Trust  Company,  a  Connecticut
Chartered State Bank and Trust Company having its principal place of business in
Westport,  Connecticut  (hereinafter  called  "Employer"),  and  Richard L. Card
(hereinafter called ("Employee").

         WHEREAS,  Richard L. Card is a valued  Employee  of the  Employer,  and
Employer  wishes to  provide  additional  inducement  for  Employee's  continued
employment,  and as additional compensation,  Employer wishes to assist Employee
with a personal life insurance program by entering into a Split Dollar Insurance
Agreement ("Agreement").

         NOW, THEREFORE, Employer and Employee agree as follows:

1.       The life  insurance  Policy with which this  Agreement  deals is Policy
         #VL9202796  (hereinafter  called  "Policy"),  issued by  Hartford  Life
         Insurance Company (hereinafter called "Insurer") on the life of Richard
         L. Card, in the face amount of $414,200.00.

2.       Employee  shall  be the  owner  of the  Policy,  and may  exercise  all
         ownership rights granted to the owner by the terms of the Policy. It is
         the express  intention  of the parties to reserve to the  Employee  all
         rights in the Policy granted by the terms of the Policy, including, but
         not  limited to, the right to borrow  against the Policy,  the right to
         assign the  owner's  interest  in the  Policy,  the right to change the
         beneficiary of the Policy,  the right to exercise  settlement  options,
         and the right to  surrender or cancel the Policy (in whole or in part).
         The Employer shall not have nor exercise any right in and to the Policy
         which could, in any way,  endanger,  defeat or impair any of the rights
         of the  Employee  in the  Policy.  The only rights in and to the Policy
         granted to the  Employer  shall be its  security  interest  in the cash
         value of the  Policy,  as defined  therein,  and its right to receive a
         portion  of the  death  benefit  of the  Policy,  as  provided  in this
         Agreement.  The  Employer  shall not  assign  any of its  rights in the
         Policy to anyone  other than the owner (or the owner's  transferee,  if
         the owner has transferred his rights in the Policy).

3.       Premiums  on the  Policy  shall be paid by the  Employer  and  shall be
         repaid to the Employer as provided in this Agreement.

4.       The  Employee  has,   contemporaneously   with  the  adoption  of  this
         agreement,  assigned the Policy to the Employer as collateral,  under a
         form of  Collateral  Assignment  attached

                                                                               1

<PAGE>
         hereto as Exhibit A. The  Employer's  interest  in the Policy  shall be
         specifically limited to the following rights in the cash value and to a
         portion of the death benefit:


(a)      Subject to paragraph 10 hereof,  the right to be repaid its  cumulative
         premiums paid or, if less, the net cash surrender  value of the Policy,
         in the event the  Policy is totally  surrendered  or  cancelled  by the
         Employee, or the right to receive the surrender proceeds, to the extent
         of its  cumulative  premiums paid, in the event the Policy is partially
         surrendered  or cancelled by the  Employee,  as provided in paragraph 5
         below .

(b)      Subject to paragraph 10 hereof,  the right to be repaid its  cumulative
         premiums paid upon the death of the Employee,  as provided in Paragraph
         6 below.

(c)      Subject to < paragraph 10 hereof, the right to be repaid its cumulative
         premiums paid or, if less, the net cash surrender  value of the Policy,
         or to receive  ownership of the Policy, in the event of the termination
         of this Agreement, as provided in paragraphs 8 and 9 below.

(d)      The right to be repaid a portion of its  cumulative  premiums paid if a
         Policy  loan or partial  withdrawal  made by the  Employee  in any year
         causes the net cash surrender value of the Policy to be a sum less than
         the Employer's  cumulative  premiums paid. In such case,  Employee will
         use a portion of any Policy  loan  proceeds  or partial  withdrawal  to
         reduce the cumulative  premiums paid by the Employer so as to cause the
         net cash surrender  value to be equal to or greater than the Employer's
         cumulative premiums paid. As used in this Agreement, the term "net cash
         surrender value" means the cash surrender value of the Policy, less the
         amount of any then  existing  loans or  withdrawals  against the Policy
         obtained by the Employee pursuant to this paragraph.

5.       The  Employee  shall  have the sole  right to  surrender  or cancel the
         Policy  (in whole or in part).  In the  event of a total  surrender  or
         cancellation by the Employee,  the Employer shall be entitled  (subject
         to paragraph 10 hereof) to receive the then outstanding  balance of its
         cumulative  premiums paid or, if less, the net cash surrender  value of
         the Policy.

6.       Upon the death of the Employee, the Employer shall be entitled (subject
         to  paragraph  10 hereof)  to  receive a portion  of the death  benefit
         provided under the Policy equal to the then outstanding  balance of its
         cumulative  premiums  paid.  The balance of the death benefit  provided
         under the Policy,  if any, shall be paid directly to the beneficiary or
         beneficiaries  designated  by the  Employee,  in the  manner and in the
         amounts provided by the beneficiary designation of the Policy.

                                                                               2
<PAGE>
7.       This  Agreement  may  be  terminated,  subject  to  the  provisions  of
         Paragraphs 8 and 9 below,  by either  party,  with consent of the other
         party, by giving notice in writing to the other party.

8.       In the event of  termination of this Agreement as provided in Paragraph
         7 above,  the Employee  shall repay to the  Employer,  within sixty (60
         days) of the date of termination,  the then outstanding  balance of its
         cumulative premiums paid hereunder,  or if less, the net cash surrender
         value of the Policy,  unless  said  amount is not  payable  pursuant to
         paragraph 10 hereof.  Upon receipt of this amount,  the Employer  shall
         execute an  appropriate  release of its  Collateral  Assignment  of the
         Policy.

9.       If the Employee fails to repay the Employer the amount specified in and
         payable  under  paragraph 8 above within sixty (60) days of the date of
         termination  of the  Agreement  (unless  said  amount  is  not  payable
         pursuant to paragraph 10 hereof),  the Employee  shall  execute any and
         all instruments that may be required to vest ownership of the Policy in
         the Employer.  Thereafter,  the Employee shall have no further interest
         in the Policy or in this Agreement.

10.      In the event the  Employee's  employment is  terminated  for any reason
         other  than  cause  (as that  term is  defined  in  paragraph  8 of the
         Employee's  Employment  Agreement  with the  Employer as amended by the
         Amendment  dated November 13, 1995),  or the  Employee's  employment is

                             (COLLATERAL ASSIGNMENT)



         THIS  ASSIGNMENT  is made and  entered  into this 1st day of  December,
1995, by the undersigned as owner of a certain Life Insurance Policy  #VL9202796
("Policy") issued by Hartford Life Insurance Company ("Insurer"),  upon the life
of Richard L. Card, and The Westport Bank & Trust Company (the "Assignee").

         WHEREAS, Richard L. Card is a valued Employee of the Assignee, and

         WHEREAS,  Employee  has  entered  into a Split  Dollar  Agreement  with
Assignee (the "Agreement"), and

         WHEREAS,  in  consideration  of the  Assignee  agreeing to make premium
payments,  the Employee agrees to grant the Assignee a security  interest in the
Policy as collateral  security for the repayment of cumulative  premiums paid by
the Assignee.

         NOW, THEREFORE, the undersigned Employee hereby assigns,  transfers and
sets over to the Assignee the following specific rights in the Policy subject to
the following terms and conditions:

1.       This  Assignment  is made,  and the Policy is to be held, as collateral
         security for all  liabilities  of the Employee to the Assignee,  either
         now existing or that may hereafter arise,  pursuant to the terms of the
         Agreement.

2.       The Assignee's interest in the Policy shall be strictly limited to:

         (a)      Subject  to  paragraph  10 of the  Agreement,  the right to be
                  repaid a portion of its  cumulative  premiums paid if a Policy
                  loan or partial  withdrawal  made by the  Employee in any year
                  causes the net cash surrender value of Policy to be a sum less
                  than the Employer's cumulative premiums paid.

         (b)      Subject  to  paragraph  10 of the  Agreement,  the right to be
                  repaid its cumulative  premiums paid or, if less, the net cash
                  surrender  value of the  Policy,  in the event  the  Policy is
                  totally  surrendered  or cancelled by the Employee as provided
                  in Paragraph 5 of the Agreement.


                                                                               6
<PAGE>

         (c)      Subject  to  paragraph  10 of the  Agreement,  the right to be
                  repaid its cumulative premiums paid, in the event of the death
                  of the Insured as provided in paragraph 6 of the Agreement.

         (d)      Subject  to  paragraph  10 of the  Agreement,  the right to be
                  repaid its cumulative premiums paid, or, if less, the net cash
                  surrender value of the Policy,  or to receive ownership of the
                  Policy,  in the  event  of  termination  of the  Agreement  as
                  provided in paragraph 8 of the Agreement.

3.       The  Employee  shall  retain all  incidents of ownership in the Policy,
         including, but not limited to, the sole and exclusive rights to: borrow
         against the Policy; make withdrawals from the Policy; assign Employee's
         interest in the Policy; change the beneficiary of the Policy;  exercise
         settlement options; and, surrender or cancel the Policy (in whole or in
         part).  All of these incidents of ownership shall be exercisable by the
         Employee unilaterally and without the consent of any other person.

4.       The Assignee shall, upon request, if the Policy is in the possession of
         the Assignee,  forward the Policy to the Insurer,  without unreasonable
         delay,  for change of  beneficiary,  any  election of optional  mode of
         settlement,  of  the  exercise  of  any  other  right  reserved  by the
         Employee.

5.       The Insurer is hereby  authorized to recognize the Assignee's claims to
         rights for any action taken by the Assignee, the validity or the amount
         of any of the  liabilities  of the Employee to the  Assignee  under the
         Agreement,  the  existence  of any default  therein,  the giving of any
         notice required  herein,  or the application to be made by the Assignee
         of any amounts to be paid to the Assignee.  The receipt of the Assignee
         for any  sums  received  by it shall be a full  discharge  and  release
         therefore to the Insured.

6.       The Insurer shall be fully  protected in  recognizing a request made by
         the Employee for surrender or cancellation  of the Policy,  in whole or
         in part, or in recognizing a request made by the Employee for any loans
         against the Policy  permitted by the terms of the Policy.  In the event
         this  request  is  made,  the  Insurer  may  pay  the  proceeds  of any
         surrender,  cancellation, or loan to the sole order of the Employee, or
         as the Employee shall direct.

7.       Upon  the  full  payment  of the  liabilities  of the  Employee  to the
         Assignee  pursuant  to the  Agreement  or  the  satisfaction  of  these
         liabilities  pursuant to  paragraph 10 of the  Agreement,  the Assignee
         shall execute an appropriate release of this Collateral Assignment.

                                                                               7
<PAGE>
8.       It is the  express  intention  of the  Employee  to  assign  a  limited
         interest in the Policy to the Assignee as Security for certain  premium
         payments  made  by  the  Assignee,  without  giving  the  Assignee  any
         incidents of ownership in the Policy within the meaning of section 2042
         of the  Internal  Revenue  Code (and  regulations  thereunder),  or any
         similar  provision of subsequent law. All provisions of this Collateral
         Assignment  shall be  construed  and  exercised  to as to  effect  that
         intention.

9.       When  the  Agreement  is  terminated  pursuant  to  the  provisions  of
         paragraph 10 of the Agreement,  the cumulative  premiums charged by the
         Assignee  pursuant  to the terms of the Policy  shall be charged to the
         Employee as additional compensation.

         IN WITNESS WHEREOF the Employee has executed this Assignment  effective
the day and year first above written.

Article 2  - Supplemental Retirement Benefits

         2.1 General. Unless stated otherwise in the Participation Agreement and
subject to the  subsequent  provisions  of this  SERP,  a  Participant  shall be
entitled  to receive a  Supplemental  Retirement  Benefit  under this SERP.  The
Supplemental  Retirement  Benefit shall be equal to the Annual Benefit described

specified in Section 2.5.

         A Participant's  Supplemental  Retirement Benefit under this SERP shall
be 100% nonforfeitable.

         2.2 Annual  Benefit.  The Annual  Benefit for a Participant  who is not
eligible to receive an Annual  Benefit  under  Section 2.3 shall be equal to the
product of the amount determined under (a) and the fraction determined under (b)
as set forth below.

                  (a) an amount equal to the  difference  between (1) and (2) as
follows: (1) 70% of the Participant's  Average Annual Compensation;  and (2) the
Participant's Pension Benefit.

                  (b) A fraction not in excess of one  determined  in accordance
with the following sentence.  The numerator of the fraction is the Participant's
Years of Service and the  denominator  of the fraction is the number of Years of
Service with which a Participant would be credited if he remained employed until
his Normal Retirement Date.

         2.3 Early Retirement Annual Benefit. If a Participant has a Termination
of  Employment  with  the  Bank on or  after  his  Early  Retirement  Date,  the
Participant will receive the Annual Benefit determined under this Section 2.3. A

Benefit under this Section 2.3 shall be equal to the difference  between (a) and
(b) as follows:

                  (a) 70% of the Participant's  Average Annual Compensation,  as
reduced  by  .55%  for  each  month  by  which  the  date  of the  Participant's
distribution under this SERP precedes the Participant's  Normal Retirement Date,
to a maximum of 60 months, plus .35% for each additional month by which the date
of the  Participant's  distribution  under this SERP precedes the  Participant's
Normal Retirement Date; and

                  (b) the  Participant's  Pension Benefit adjusted so that it is
the  actuarial  equivalent  (based on the  early  retirement  reduction  factors
specified in the Pension Plan) of a benefit commencing on the date that payments
under this Plan begin.

         2.4 Timing of Supplemental Retirement Benefits.
         -----------------------------------------------

                  (a)  In  the  case  of  a  Participant  whose  Termination  of
Employment  occurs  before his Early  Retirement  date or on or after his Normal
Retirement  Date  distribution  of payments under Section 2.2 shall begin on the
first  day of  the  calendar  month  next  following  the  Participant's  Normal
Retirement  Date, or if later,  his Termination of Employment.  In the case of a
Participant  whose  Termination  of  Employment  occurs  on or after  his  Early
Retirement  Date  distribution of payments under Section 2.3 shall begin as soon
as practicable after his Termination of Employment occurs, but in no event later
than  the  first  day  of the  calendar  month  following  such  Termination  of
Employment.


                                                                             6

         2.5 Form of Supplemental Retirement Benefits.
         ---------------------------------------------

                  (a) Payments of the Annual  Benefits  under this SERP shall be
payable to the Participant in equal monthly  installment  payments for a maximum
period of 180 months.  If, however,  the  Participant  dies after benefits under
this SERP have commenced but, prior to the receipt of 180 monthly  payments then
payments to his designated  beneficiary  (and/or any  contingent  beneficiaries)
shall  continue  until a total of 120  monthly  payments  have  been made to the
Participant and his designated  beneficiary.  In the case of a Participant whose
designated  beneficiary is his spouse  payments shall continue  beyond the total
120 monthly  payments  until a total of 180 monthly  payments have been received
or, if earlier, the date of the spouse's death. 

                  (b) Elections of the  Participant  with respect to the form of
payment of his  Pension  Benefit  shall have no effect on the form of payment of
the Supplemental  Retirement Benefit.

                  (c) In the case of a  Participant  who dies  prior to the time
that payments under this SERP commence neither the Participant's  estate nor any
of his  beneficiaries  shall be entitled to any  benefits  under this SERP. 

                  2.6 Designation of Beneficiary.  A Participant may designate a
primary and contingent  beneficiary  for purposes of the SERP on a form provided
by the Bank  for this  purpose.  A  Participant  may  change  beneficiaries  for
purposes of the SERP at any time by executing a new  designation  of beneficiary
form.  In  the  absence  of  an  effective  designation  of a  beneficiary  by a
Participant or upon the death of all beneficiaries and/or

                                                                             7

contingent  beneficiaries,  the estate of the last person in receipt of benefits
under this SERP shall be deemed to be the contingent beneficiary.

Article 3  -  Change of Control.
- --------------------------------

         In the event of that a Change of Control  occurs,  Section 2.3 shall be
modified  to  provide  that a  Participant  who has an Actual  Termination  or a
Constructive  Termination on or after his Early  Retirement Date and on or after
the  occurrence of the Change of Control  shall receive an Annual  Benefit under
Section 2.3 equal to the difference between (a) and (b) as follows:

         (a) 70% of the Participant's  Average Annual Compensation as reduced by
 .35% for each month by which the date of the  Participant's  distribution  under
this SERP precedes age sixty (60); and

         (b)  the  Participant's  Pension  Benefit  adjusted  so  that it is the
actuarial  equivalent (based on the early retirement reduction factors specified
in the Pension Plan) of a benefit  commencing  on the date that  payments  under
Section 2.3 of this Plan begin.

         Actual Termination and Constructive Termination shall mean an actual or
constructive  termination of employment as defined in a Participant's Employment
Agreement with the Bank or Westport Bancorp, Inc.

Article 4 - Source of Funding.
- ------------------------------

The rights of a Participant  or his  beneficiary  under the SERP shall be solely
those of an  unsecured  creditor of the Bank.  Benefits  under the SERP shall be
paid from the general funds of the Bank, and the SERP constitutes no more than a
mere promise by the Bank

                                                                             8

to make benefit payments in the future.  However, the Bank in its discretion may
apply for and procure,  as owner and for its own benefit,  life insurance and/or
establish a trust which is intended to constitute an unfunded  arrangement  (for
tax purposes and for purposes of Title I of the Employee Retirement Security Act
of 1974,  as amended) to assist the Bank in meeting its  liabilities  under this
SERP. Any such trust and the assets held  thereunder  shall conform to the terms
of the model trust, as described in Internal  Revenue Service Revenue  Procedure
92-64.  The  existence  of the trust shall in no event  conflict  with the other
provisions  of this  Article 4 or the  provisions  of Article  6. Any  insurance
policies or other  assets  acquired or held by the Bank in  connection  with the
liabilities  assumed  by it under the SERP  shall be and shall  remain  the sole
property  of the Bank as  unpledged  and  unrestricted  assets  of the  Bank.  A
Participant shall have no preferred claim on or any beneficial  ownership rights
of any nature with respect to such policies or other assets  including,  but not
limited to, the trust.

Article 5  - Independent Benefit.
- ---------------------------------

         5.1 No Employment  Rights.  The terms and  conditions of the SERP shall
not under any  circumstances be construed as a contract of employment  between a
Participant  and the Bank,  and a Participant or his  beneficiary  shall have no
rights against the Bank except as may be provided  specifically herein.  Nothing
in the  SERP  shall  be  deemed  to  restrict  in any way the  Bank's  right  to
discipline a Participant or to terminate his employment, nor shall it restrict a
Participant's right to terminate employment.

                                                                              9

<PAGE>

         5.2 Effect of SERP Payment on Other  Benefit  Plans.  Benefits  payable
pursuant to the SERP shall not be deemed  salary or other  compensation  for the
purpose of computing  benefits to which a Participant  may be entitled under any
pension plan or other benefit plan of the Bank.

Article 6 - Non-assignability.
- ------------------------------

Subject to the  provisions of Article 7, neither the  Participant  nor any other
person  shall  have any  right  to  commute,  sell,  assign,  transfer,  pledge,
anticipate, mortgage, or otherwise encumber, hypothecate or convey in advance of
actual  receipt the amounts,  if any,  payable  hereunder,  or any part thereof,
which are, and all rights to which are,  expressly  declared to be  unassignable
and  non-transferable.  No part of the amounts  payable  shall,  prior to actual
payment,  be subject to seizure or  sequestration  for the payment of any debts,
judgements,  alimony or separate  maintenance owed by a Participant or any other
person,  nor be transferable by operation of law in the event of a Participant's
or any other person's bankruptcy or insolvency.

Article 7 - Right of Offset.
- ----------------------------

The Bank shall  have the right,  in its  discretion,  to reduce any SERP  amount
payable  to a  Participant  (or,  if  applicable,  the  Participant's  spouse or
beneficiary) by the amount of any indebtedness of the Participant to the Bank.


                                                                             10


<PAGE>
Article 8- Severability.
- ------------------------

If the SERP shall ever be  determined by the Internal  Revenue  Service to bring
about  immediate  inclusion of benefits in the gross income of the  Participant,
then such amounts and only such amounts  which would be treated as income by the
Internal  Revenue  Service  at that time shall be paid  immediately  over to the
Participant.  All other amounts shall be distributed  to the  Participant as set
forth in Article 2 above.

                                 FIRST AMENDMENT
                                     TO THE
                     SUPPLEMENTAL EXECUTIVE RETIREMENT PLAN


         WHEREAS,  at its meeting held November 13, 1995, the Board of Directors
adopted The Westport Bank & Trust Company Supplemental Executive Retirement Plan
(the "Plan"); and

         WHEREAS,  at its meeting held November 29, 1995, the Board of Directors
adopted an Amended  Supplemental  Executive Retirement Plan (the "Amended Plan")
which eliminated the actuarial early retirement  reduction for a Participant who
is actually or  constructively  terminated on or after his early retirement date
and on or after the occurrence of a change of control of the Bank; and

         WHEREAS,  both the Plan and the Amended Plan provide that a Participant
will receive an early  retirement  benefit  equivalent to the normal  retirement
benefit to which he would have been  entitled  if he had  remained in service to
age 65 without  adjustment to reflect the shorter period of service completed at
the Participant's early retirement date; and

         WHEREAS,  the Board of Directors intended that the Amended Plan provide
Participants  with  an  early  retirement   benefit  unreduced  to  reflect  the
Participant's  shorter  period of service  only after a change of control of the
Bank; and

         WHEREAS,  it is  necessary in the judgment of the Board of Directors to
correct the Amended Plan to reflect the intent of the Board of Directors.

         NOW, THEREFORE,  BE IT RESOLVED, that effective as of November 29,1995,
the  Amended  Plan be and it is hereby  amended by  deleting  Section 2.3 of the
Amended Plan in its entirety and substituting the following:

         2.3 Early Retirement Annual Benefit. If a Participant has a Termination
         of Employment with the Bank on or after his Early  Retirement Date, the
         Participant  will  receive  the Annual  Benefit  determined  under this
         Section  2.3. A  Participant's  Annual  Benefit  under this Section 2.3
         shall be equal to the amount determined by subtracting (b) from (a) and
         multiplying the result by (c) where:

         (a)      is 70% of the Participant's  Average Annual  Compensation,  as
                  reduced  by .55%  for  each  month  by  which  the date of the
                  Participant's   distribution  under  this  SERP  precedes  the
                  Participant's  Normal  Retirement  Date,  to a  maximum  of 60
                  months, plus .35% for each additional month by which the

<PAGE>

                  date  of  the  Participant's   distribution  under  this  SERP
                  precedes the Participant's Normal Retirement Date;

         (b)      is the  Participant's  Pension Benefit  adjusted so that it is
                  the  actuarial  equivalent  (based  on  the  early  retirement
                  reduction  factors specified in the Pension Plan) of a benefit
                  commencing  on the date that  payments  under this Plan begin;
                  and

         (c)      is a fraction not in excess of one  determined  in  accordance
                  with the following sentence.  The numerator of the fraction is
                  the Participant's  Years of Service and the denominator of the
                  fraction  is the  number  of Years  of  Service  with  which a
                  Participant  would be credited if he remained  employed  until
                  his Normal Retirement Date; and further

The undersigned  being the Secretary of the Bank and Bancorp does hereby certify
that this First Amendment to the Supplemental Executive Retirement Plan was duly
adopted by the Board of Directors of the Bank and Bancorp at their  meeting held
on January 18, 1996.

                                   TRUST UNDER
                        THE WESTPORT BANK & TRUST COMPANY
                     SUPPLEMENTAL EXECUTIVE RETIREMENT PLAN


         This, Agreement made this 13th day of November, 1995 by and between The
Westport Bank & Trust Company ("Company") and People's Bank ("Trustee");

         WHEREAS,  Company has adopted the non qualified  deferred  Compensation
Plan  entitled  the  Westport  Bank  &  Trust  Company  Supplemental   Executive
Retirement Plan ("Plan") attached as Schedule A to this Agreement.

         WHEREAS,  Company has incurred or expects to incur  liability under the
terms of such Plan with respect to the individuals participating in such Plan;

         WHEREAS,  Company  wishes  to  establish  a trust  (hereinafter  called
"Trust")  and to  contribute  to the Trust  assets  that shall be held  therein,
subject  to the  claims  of  Company's  creditors  in  the  event  of  Company's
Insolvency,  as  herein  defined,  until  paid to Plan  participants  and  their
beneficiaries in such manner and at such times as specified in the Plan;

         WHEREAS,  it is the  intention  of the  parties  that this Trust  shall
constitute an unfunded  arrangement  and shall not affect the status of the Plan
as  an  unfunded  plan   maintained  for  the  purpose  of  providing   deferred
compensation  for a select group of management or highly  compensated  employees
for purposes of Title I of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974;

         WHEREAS,  it is the intention of Company to make  contributions  to the
Trust to provide  itself  with a source of funds to assist it in the  meeting of
its liabilities under the Plan;

         NOW,  THEREFORE,  the parties do hereby  establish  the Trust and agree
that the Trust shall be comprised, held and disposed of as follows:

SECTION 1.  ESTABLISHMENT OF TRUST
            ----------------------

         (a) Company hereby  deposits with Trustee in trust the assets set forth
in  Schedule  B,  which  shall  become  the  principal  of the Trust to be held,
administered and disposed of by Trustee as provided in this Trust Agreement.


                                                                             1

<PAGE>

         (b) The Trust shall  become  irrevocable  ten (10) days  following  the
issuance of a  favorable  private  letter  ruling  regarding  the Trust from the
Internal Revenue Service.

         (c) The Trust is intended to be a grantor  trust,  of which  Company is
the grantor,  within the meaning of subpart E, part I,  subchapter J, chapter 1,
subtitle  A of the  Internal  Revenue  Code of 1986,  as  amended,  and shall be
construed accordingly.

         (d) The principal of the Trust,  and any earnings thereon shall be held
separate and apart from other funds of Company and shall be used exclusively for
the uses and purposes of Plan  participants and general  creditors as herein set
forth. Plan participants and their  beneficiaries  shall have no preferred claim
on, or any beneficial ownership interest in, any assets of the Trust. Any rights
created  under  the Plan  and  this  Trust  Agreement  shall  be mere  unsecured
contractual rights of Plan participants and their beneficiaries against Company.
Any assets held by the Trust will be subject to the claims of Company's  general
creditors under federal and state law in the event of Insolvency,  as defined in
Section 3(a) herein.

         (e) Within ninety (90) days following the end of the Plan year,  ending
after the Trust has become irrevocable pursuant to Section 1(b) hereof,  Company
shall be required to irrevocably  deposit  additional  cash or other property to
the Trust in an amount  sufficient to pay each Plan  participant  or beneficiary
the benefits  payable pursuant to the terms of the Plan as of the closing of the
Plan year.

         (f) Upon a Change of Control,  Company shall, as soon as possible,  but
in no event  longer than sixty (60) days  following  the Change of  Control,  as
defined herein, make an irrevocable  contribution to the Trust in an amount that
is sufficient to pay each Plan  participant or beneficiary the benefits to which
Plan participants or their beneficiaries would be entitled pursuant to the terms
of the Plan as of the date on which the Change of Control occurred.

SECTION  2.  PAYMENTS TO PLAN PARTICIPANTS AND THEIR BENEFICIARIES.
             -------------------------------------------------------

         (a)  Company   shall  deliver  to  Trustee  a  schedule  (the  "Payment
Schedule")   that  indicates  the  amounts  payable  in  respect  of  each  Plan
participant  (and his or her  beneficiaries),  that  provides a formula or other
instructions  acceptable to Trustee for determining the amounts so payable,  the
form in which such amount is to be paid (as provided for or available  under the
Plan),  and the time of  commencement  for  payment of such  amounts.  Except as
otherwise provided herein,  Trustee shall make payments to the Plan participants
and their  beneficiaries in accordance with such Payment  Schedule.  The Trustee
shall make provision for the reporting and withholding of

                                                                             2

<PAGE>



any  federal,  state or local taxes that may be  required  to be  withheld  with
respect to the payment of  benefits  pursuant to the terms of the Plan and shall
pay amounts  withheld to the  appropriate  taxing  authorities or determine that
such amounts have been reported, withheld and paid by Company.

         (b) The entitlement of a Plan  participant or his or her  beneficiaries
to benefits  under the Plan shall be  determined  by Company or such party as it
shall  designate  under the  Plan,  and any  claim  for such  benefits  shall be
considered and reviewed under the procedures set out in the Plan.

         (c) Company may make payment of benefits  directly to Plan participants
or their  beneficiaries as they become due under the terms of the Plan.  Company
shall notify Trustee of its decision to make payment of benefits  directly prior
to the time  amounts  are payable to  participants  or their  beneficiaries.  In
addition,  if the  principal  of the Trust,  and any earnings  thereon,  are not
sufficient  to make  payments of benefits  in  accordance  with the terms of the
Plan,  Company  shall  make the  balance  of each such  payment as it falls due.
Trustee shall notify Company where principal and earnings are not sufficient.

SECTION 3.  TRUSTEE RESPONSIBILITY REGARDING PAYMENTS TO TRUST BENEFICIARY WHEN 
            -------------------------------------------------------------------
COMPANY IS INSOLVENT.
- --------------------

         (a) Trustee  shall cease payment of benefits to Plan  participants  and
their  beneficiaries  if the Company is  Insolvent.  Company shall be considered
"Insolvent" for purposes of this Trust Agreement if (i) Company is unable to pay
its debts as they become due, or (ii) Company is subject to a pending proceeding
as a debtor  under the  United  States  Bankruptcy  Code,  or (iii)  Company  is
determined to be in a troubled  condition or is assigned a composite rating of 4
or 5 under the  Uniform  Institutions  Rating  System of the  Federal  Financial
Institution Examination Council by the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve
System or the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation.

         (b) At all times during the  continuance of this Trust,  as provided in
Section l(d) hereof,  the  principal and income of the Trust shall be subject to
claims of general  creditors of Company under federal and state law as set forth
below.

                  (1) The Board of Directors and the Chief Executive  Officer of
Company  shall  have  the  duty  to  inform  Trustee  in  writing  of  Company's
Insolvency.  If a person claiming to be a creditor of Company alleges in writing
to Trustee that Company has become  Insolvent,  Trustee shall determine  whether
Company is Insolvent and, pending such determination,  Trustee shall discontinue
payment of benefits to Plan participants or their beneficiaries.


                                                                              3

<PAGE>
                  (2)  Unless   Trustee  has  actual   knowledge   of  Company's
Insolvency,  or has received  notice from  Company or a person  claiming to be a
creditor  alleging  that  Company is  Insolvent,  Trustee  shall have no duty to
inquire  whether  Company is  Insolvent.  Trustee may in all events rely on such
evidence  concerning  Company's solvency as may be furnished to Trustee and that
provides Trustee with a reasonable  basis for making a determination  concerning
Company's solvency.

                  (3) If at any time  Trustee  has  determined  that  Company is
Insolvent,  Trustee shall  discontinue  payments to Plan  participants  or their
beneficiaries  and  shall  hold the  assets  of the  Trust  for the  benefit  of
Company's  general  creditors.  Nothing in this Trust Agreement shall in any way
diminish any rights of Plan participants or their  beneficiaries to pursue their
rights as general  creditors  of Company  with respect to benefits due under the
Plan or otherwise.

                  (4)  Trustee  shall  resume the  payment of  benefits  to Plan
participants or their  beneficiaries  in accordance with Section 2 of this Trust
Agreement only after Trustee has determined that Company is not Insolvent (or is
no longer Insolvent).

         (c) Provided that there are sufficient assets, if Trustee  discontinues
the  payment of  benefits  from the Trust  pursuant  to Section  3(b) hereof and
subsequently   resumes  such   payments,   the  first  payment   following  such
discontinuance  shall include the  aggregate  amount of all payments due to Plan
participants or their  beneficiaries  under the terms of the Plan for the period
of such  discontinuance,  less the aggregate amount of any payments made to Plan
participants or their  beneficiaries by Company in lieu of the payments provided
for hereunder during any such period of discontinuance.

SECTION 4.  PAYMENTS TO COMPANY.
            --------------------

         Except as  provided  in  Section 3 hereof,  after the Trust has  become
irrevocable, Company shall have no right or power to direct Trustee to return to
Company or to divert to others  any of the Trust  assets  before all  payment of
benefits have been made to Plan participants and their beneficiaries pursuant to
the terms of the Plan.

SECTION 5.  INVESTMENT AUTHORITY.
            ---------------------

         (a) In no event may Trustee  invest in securities  (including  stock or
rights to  acquire  stock) or  obligations  issued by  Company,  other than a de
minimis amount held in common investment vehicles in which Trustee invests.  All
rights  associated with assets of the Trust shall be exercised by Trustee or the
person  designated by Trustee,  and shall in no event be  exercisable by or rest

the written  investment  guidelines  established  by the  Company  and  Trustee,
Trustee  shall invest and reinvest the assets of the Trust  without  distinction

common, collective, or pooled trust fund maintained by any bank or trust company
including  the Company or the trustee  hereunder,  all or such part of the Trust
Fund as  Trustee  may deem  advisable,  and such  part or all of such  assets so
transferred  shall be  subject  to all the terms and  provisions  of the  common
collective,   or  pooled  trust  fund  which  contemplate  the  commingling  for
investment  purposes  of such trust  assets with trust  assets of other  trusts.
Trustee may, from time to time withdraw from such common,  collective, or pooled
trust  fund all or such  part of the  assets of the  Trust as  Trustee  may deem
advisable.

         (d) Trustee, in addition to all powers and authorities under common and
statutory law shall have the following powers and  authorities,  to be exercised
in the Trustee's sole discretion:

         (a) During the term of this  Trust,  all income  received by the Trust,
net of expenses and taxes, shall be accumulated and reinvested.

SECTION 7.  ACCOUNTING BY TRUSTEE.
            ----------------------

         (a)  Trustee   shall  keep   accurate  and  detailed   records  of  all
investments,  receipts, disbursements, and all other transactions required to be
made, including such specific records as shall be agreed upon in writing between
Company and Trustee. Within sixty (60) days following the close of each calendar
year and within  sixty (60) days after the  removal or  resignation  of Trustee,
Trustee shall deliver to Company a written account of its  administration of the
Trust during such year or during the period from the close of the last preceding
year to the date of such removal or resignation,  setting forth all investments,
receipts,  disbursements  and other  transactions  effected  by it,  including a
description of all securities and  investments  purchased and sold with the cost
or net proceeds of such purchases or sales (accrued  interest paid or receivable
being shown  separately),  and showing all cash,  securities  and other property
held in the Trust at the end of such year or as of the date of such  removal  or
resignation, as the case may be.

                                                                             7


<PAGE>

         (b)  Company,  forthwith  upon its  receipt of each such  statement  of
account,  shall acknowledge receipt thereof in writing and advise Trustee of its
approval  or  disapproval  thereof.  Failure by Company to  disapprove  any such
statement of account within ninety (90) days after its receipt  thereof shall be
deemed an approval thereof.  The approval by Company of any statement of account
shall be binding as to all  matters  embraced  therein  as between  Company  and
Trustee to the same  extent as if the  account of  Trustee  had been  settled by
judgment  or decree in an action for a judicial  settlement  of its account in a
court of competent jurisdiction in which Trustee, Company and all persons having
or  claiming  an  interest in the Plan were  parties;  provided,  however,  that
nothing herein contained shall deprive Trustee of its right to have its accounts
judicially settled if Trustee so desires.

SECTION 8.  RESPONSIBILITY OF TRUSTEE.

         (a) Trustee  shall act with the care,  skill,  prudence  and  diligence
under the  circumstances  then  prevailing  that a prudent person acting in like
capacity  and  familiar  with  such  matters  would  use  in the  conduct  of an
enterprise  of a like  character  and with like aims,  provided,  however,  that
Trustee shall incur no liability to any person for any action taken  pursuant to
a direction,  request or approval given by Company which is contemplated by, and
in conformity  with, the terms of the Plan or this Trust and is given in writing
by Company.  In the event of a dispute between Company and a party,  Trustee may
apply to a court of competent jurisdiction to resolve the dispute.

         (b)  If  Trustee  undertakes  or  defends  any  litigation  arising  in
connection  with  this  Trust,  Company  agrees  to  indemnify  Trustee  against
Trustee's  costs,  expenses  and  liabilities  (including,  without  limitation,
attorneys' fees and expenses)  relating  thereto and to be primarily  liable for
such payments. If Company does not pay such costs, expenses and liabilities in a
reasonably timely manner, Trustee may obtain payment from the Trust.

         (c) Trustee may consult with legal counsel (who may also be counsel for
Company  generally)  with respect to any of its duties or obligations  hereunder
and the cost thereof shall be paid for by the Company.

         (d)  Trustee  may  hire  agents,  accountants,   actuaries,  investment
advisors,   financial  consultants  or  other  professionals  to  assist  it  in
performing any of its duties or obligations hereunder and the cost thereof shall
be paid for by the Company.

         (e) Trustee  shall have,  without  exclusion,  all powers  conferred on
trustees  by  applicable  law,  unless  expressly   provided  otherwise  herein;
provided, however, that if an insurance policy is held as an asset of the Trust,
Trustee shall have no power to name a  beneficiary  of the policy other than the
Trust,  to assign the policy (as  distinct  

                                                                              8

from  conversion  of the policy to a  different  form) other than to a successor
Trustee,  or to loan to any person the  proceeds of any  borrowing  against such
policy.


         (f)  Notwithstanding  any powers  granted to Trustee  pursuant  to this
Trust  Agreement or to  applicable  law,  Trustee  shall not have any power that
could give this Trust the  objective  of carrying on a business and dividing the
gains therefrom,  within the meaning of section  301.7701-2 of the Procedure and
Administrative Regulations promulgated pursuant to the Internal Revenue Code.

         (g) Trustee shall have no  responsibility or obligation with respect to
the  administration or operation of the Plan,  including without  limitation any
responsibility  to  determine  the amount or nature of the benefits to which any
participant or beneficiary may be entitled under the Plan.

            -------------------------------------

         The Compensation of Trustee shall be as determined from time to time in
accordance with any agreement  between Company and Trustee;  provided,  however,
that Trustee may amend its fee schedule with thirty (30) days written  notice to
Company. All administration  expenses,  including Trustee's fees, and any income
taxes and other taxes of any kind levied or  assessed  under  existing or future
laws against the Trust shall be the  obligation  of Company and shall be paid as
directed by Company, provided, however, if such expenses are not paid by Company
within a reasonable time, they shall be paid by Trustee from the Trust and shall
be a claim on the Trust assets to be provided for prior to making provisions for
or for paying benefits under the Plan to any participant,  former  participants,
or their beneficiaries.

SECTION lO.  RESIGNATION AND REMOVAL OF TRUSTEE.
             -----------------------------------

shall be effective  sixty (60) days after receipt of such notice unless  Company
and Trustee agree otherwise.

         (b) Trustee may be removed by Company on sixty (60) days notice or upon
shorter notice accepted by Trustee.

         (c) Upon  resignation  or  removal  of  Trustee  and  appointment  of a

Trustee.  The transfer shall be completed  within ninety (90) days after receipt
of notice of resignation  removal or transfer,  unless Company  extends the time
limit.


                                                                             9

appointment  of a  successor  or for  instructions.  All  expenses of Trustee in
connection with the proceeding  shall be allowed as  administrative  expenses of
the Trust.

SECTION 12.  AMENDMENT OR TERMINATION.
             -------------------------

         (a)  This  Trust  Agreement  may be  amended  by a  written  instrument
executed  by  Trustee  and  Company.  Notwithstanding  the  foregoing,  no  such
amendment  shall  conflict  with the  terms of the Plan or shall  make the Trust
revocable after it become irrevocable in accordance with Section l(b) hereof.

         (b) The  Trust  shall  not  terminate  until  the  date on  which  Plan

         (d) Sections 1, 2, 3, 4, 8, 9, and 12 of this Trust  Agreement  may not

                                                                             10

SECTION 13.  MISCELLANEOUS.
             --------------

         (a) Any  provision of this Trust  Agreement  prohibited by law shall be
ineffective  to the extent of any such  prohibition,  without  invalidating  the
remaining provisions hereof.

         (b) Benefits payable to Plan participants and their beneficiaries under
this  Trust  Agreement  may not be  anticipated,  assigned  (either at law or in
equity), alienated, pledged, encumbered or subjected to attachment, garnishment,
levy, execution or other legal or equitable process.

         (c)  This  Trust  Agreement  shall  be  governed  by and  construed  in

or beneficial ownership of any class of voting securities of Company is acquired
by a person either  directly or  indirectly or acting  through one or more other
persons.  A  "person"  shall  include a natural  person,  corporation,  or other
entity.  When two or more  persons act as a  partnership,  limited  partnership,
syndicate, or other group for the purpose of acquiring, holding, or disposing of
the  Company  stock,  such  partnership,  syndicate,  or  other  group  shall be
considered one person. "Beneficial ownership" shall be determined under the then
current provision of Securities Exchange Act Rule 13d-3; Reg. Section 740.13d-3;
(ii) the  individuals who constitute the Board of Directors of Company as of the
date hereof (the "Incumbent  Board") cease for any reason to constitute at least
a majority thereof,  provided that any person becoming a director  subsequent to
the date set forth above whose  election or nomination for election by Company's
shareholders  was approved by a vote of at least three quarters of the Incumbent
Board  (either by a  specific  vote or by  approval  of the proxy  statement  of
Company  in which  such  person  is named as a  nominee  for  director,  without
objection to such  nomination)  shall be deemed to be a member of the  Incumbent
Board;  or (iii) Company  shall be combined with or acquired by another  company
and the  Incumbent  Board  shall have  determined,  either  before such event or
thereafter,  by  resolution,  that a Change in Control  of  Company  will or has
occurred.

         (e) Any action by Company  pursuant  to any of the  provisions  of this
Trust  Agreement  shall be in  writing  and  shall be signed  by an  officer  of
Company.  Trustee and every other person shall be entitled to rely  conclusively
upon any and all such notices, directions, orders, requests,  certifications and
instructions  received  from  Company  and  reasonably  believed  to be properly
executed,  and shall act and be  indemnified  and held  harmless  by the Company
regarding any cost, expense or assessment incurred or made as a result of acting
in accordance  with such  reasonable  belief.  Company shall notify Trustee from
time to time in writing of the appointment and termination of any party

                                                                             11

designated to administer the Plan and of any successor, together with a specimen
of his authorized signature. Trustee shall be entitled to rely conclusively upon
such notice and signature as evidence of the identity of such  designated  party
and  shall not be  charged  with  notice  of any  change  with  respect  to such
designated party until Company shall have furnished  Trustee with notice of such
change.

         (f)  Neither  Company  nor  Trustee,  nor  their  successors,  shall be
responsible for the validity of any insurance  contract issued  hereunder or for
the  failure on the part of the  insurer to make  payments  provided by any such
insurance  contract or for the action of any person  which may delay  payment or
render an insurance contract null and void or unenforceable in whole or in part.

         (g) Any insurer who shall issue insurance  contacts hereunder shall not
have any  responsibility  for the  validity  of the Plan or for the tax or legal
aspects of the Plan.  The insurer shall be protected and held harmless in acting
in accordance with any written  direction of Trustee,  and shall have no duty to
see to the application of any funds paid to Trustee, nor be required to question
any actions  directed by Trustee.  Regardless of any provision of this Plan, the
insurer  shall not be required to take or permit any action or allow any benefit
or privilege  contrary to the terms of any  insurance  contract  which it issues
hereunder, or the rules of the insurer.

         (h) Trustee shall not be liable for any loss  sustained by the Trust by
reason of the  Trustee's  decision to  purchase,  retain,  sell or exchange  any
investment (including but not limited to life insurance policies on the lives of
Plan participants, employees and former employees of Company) made in good faith
and in accordance  with the  provisions of this  Agreement and of any applicable
Federal or state law. Company shall indemnify and hold Trustee harmless from any
and all liability, claim, or demand asserted against Trustee with respect to, or
as a result of, or arising out of, or in connection with, directly or indirectly
any action  allegedly taken by it or any failure or alleged failure by it to act
in its capacity as Trustee,  except that Company  shall not  indemnify  and hold
harmless  any  such  Trustee  if  such  action  or  failure  to act  is  finally
adjudicated to be the result of the Trustee's gross negligence, fraud or willful
misconduct.

         available  personnel for positions of substantial  responsibility  with
         Westport Bancorp, Inc. ("Bancorp"), or any of its subsidiaries that now
         exist or that Bancorp may  hereafter  organize or acquire  (hereinafter
         collectively  called the  "Corporation");  (ii) to  provide  additional
         incentive to such  personnel;  and (iii) to encourage  the ownership of
         Bancorp Common Stock by such personnel,  thereby  promoting the success
         of the Corporation.

2.       Effective  Date.  The Plan shall become  effective on May 25, 1995, and
         shall terminate as provided herein.

3.       Stock Reserved for the Plan. The number of shares of the authorized but
         unissued  Common  Stock,  par value  $0.01 per share,  of Bancorp  (the
         "Common  Stock") that are reserved for issue and may be issued upon the
         exercise of options granted under the Plan shall be 200,000 shares.

         In  lieu of such  unissued  shares,  Bancorp  may,  in its  discretion,
         transfer on the exercise of options  reacquired shares or shares bought
         in the market for the purposes of the Plan,  provided  that (subject to
         the  provisions of paragraph 13) the total number of shares that may be
         issued or sold upon the  exercise  of  options  granted  under the Plan
         shall not exceed an aggregate of 200,000.  Any employee or director may
         hold more than one option at any time.

         If any options granted under the Plan shall for any reason terminate or
         expire  without  having been exercised in full, the stock not purchased
         under such  options  shall be  available  again for the purposes of the
         Plan.

4.       Administration of the Plan.

         (a)      Procedure.  The Plan  shall be  administered  by the  Board of
                  Directors of Bancorp (the  "Board").  Members of the Board who
                  are  eligible  for options  hereunder or who have been granted
                  options may vote on any matters  affecting the  administration
                  of the Plan or the grant of any  options  pursuant to the Plan
                  except that no such member  shall act upon the  granting of an
                  option to  himself,  but any such  member  may be  counted  in
                  determining  the  existence  of a quorum at any meeting of the
                  Board  during  which  action  is  taken  with  respect  to the
                  granting of options to him.

         (b)      Powers of the Board.  Subject to the  provisions  of the Plan,
                  the  Board  shall  have  the  authority:  (i) to  grant to any
                  employee or director eligible  hereunder an option to purchase
                  shares  of  Common  Stock  that  shall be  conditioned  on the
                  execution by such  employee or director of an Incentive  Stock
                  Option Agreement substantially in the form of Exhibit I hereto
                  (with such  modifications as the Board may desire,  within the
                  terms  of the  Plan  and the  requirements  of  law);  (ii) to
                  determine  the  purchase  price for Common  Stock to be issued
                  pursuant to an option  granted  under the Plan,  the number of
                  shares to be  represented  by each option,  the  employees and
                  directors to whom and


<PAGE>


                  the  time or  times  at which  options  shall  be  granted  or
                  exercised,  and the  term of each  option,  which  in no event
                  shall be more than ten (10)  years  from the date of the grant
                  of the option; (iii) to interpret the Plan; (iv) to prescribe,
                  amend and rescind rules and regulations  relating to the Plan;
                  (v) to  determine  the terms  and  provisions  of each  option
                  granted under the Plan (which need not be identical) and, with
                  the  consent  of the holder  thereof,  to modify or amend each
                  option;  (vi) to impose  job  performance  conditions  and any
                  other  conditions  on  the  exercise  of  any  option  and  to
                  determine  whether  such  conditions  have been met;  (vii) to
                  accelerate  the  exercise  date  of  any  option;   (viii)  to
                  authorize  any person to execute on behalf of the  Corporation
                  any  instrument  required to  effectuate  a grant of an option
                  previously  granted by the  Board;  and (ix) to make all other
                  determinations   deemed   necessary  or   advisable   for  the
                  administration of the Plan. It is intended that options issued
                  hereunder  to  employees  (including  directors  who are  also
                  employees  of the  Corporation)  shall  qualify as  "incentive
                  stock options" under Section 422 of the Internal  Revenue Code
                  of  1986,  as  amended  (the  "Code"),  and  the  Board  shall
                  administer the Plan in order to preserve the  characterization
                  of options granted pursuant hereto as incentive stock options.

         (c)      Effect of Board's Decision. All decisions, determinations, and
                  interpretations of the Board shall be final and binding on all
                  holders of any options granted under the Plan.

         (d)      Committee  Recommendations.  The Compensation Committee of the
                  Board  (the  "Committee")  shall make  recommendations  to the
                  Board with respect to (i) the  employees and directors to whom
                  options  should be granted,  (ii) the terms and  provisions of
                  any option,  (iii) whether any job  performance  conditions to
                  which the exercise of a previously  granted  option is subject
                  have been met,  and (iv) any other  matter  described  in this
                  paragraph;  provided, however, that the final decisions on any
                  such matter  shall rest with the Board.  The  Committee  shall
                  also perform such other  functions  and duties with respect to
                  the Plan as the Board  shall  from time to time  assign to the
                  Committee.

5.       Eligibility;  Factors to be Considered in Granting  Options.  An option
         may be granted to any person who, at the time the option is granted, is
         an employee or  director of the  Corporation.  No option may be granted
         hereunder  to an employee  or  director  who at the time such option is
         granted  owns,  within the  meaning of Section  422 of the Code,  stock
         possessing  more than 10% of the  total  combined  voting  power of all
         classes  of  stock  of the  Corporation  or its  subsidiaries  (a  "10%
         Shareholder")  unless  the  option  price is at least  110% of the fair
         market  value of such stock on the date of grant and the option may not
         be exercised more than five (5) years after the date of grant.

         In  determining  the  employees  and directors to whom options shall be
         granted, the term of the option, and the number of shares to be covered
         by each  option,  the Board  shall take into  account the duties of the
         respective  employees  and  directors,   their  present  and  potential
         contributions to the success of the Corporation, and such other factors
         as it shall deem relevant in connection with accomplishing the purposes
         of the Plan. An employee or director who has been granted an option may
         be  granted  an  additional  option or  options  if the Board  shall so
         determine.


                                        2

6.       Option  Prices.  The purchase price of the Common Stock covered by each
         option  shall be  determined  by the Board,  but shall not be less than
         100% (or 110% in the case of an option granted to a 10% Shareholder) of
         the fair  market  value of the  Common  Stock on the date the option is
         granted.  For  purposes of this Plan,  the fair market  value of Common
         Stock shall be  determined  as of a  particular  date in the  following
         manner:  if the stock is listed or  admitted  to  trading on a national
         securities  exchange  or  reported  by  the  National   Association  of
         Securities  Dealers  Automated  Quotation System  ("NASDAQ"),  the fair
         market  value per share  shall be the closing  price of Bancorp  Common
         Stock  reported  by such  exchange  or NASDAQ for such date (or,  if no
         closing  price was reported for such date,  then the closing  price for
         the next preceding day for which a closing price was reported);  if the
         stock  is  not  then  listed  or  admitted  to  trading  on a  national
         securities  exchange or reported by NASDAQ, the fair market value shall
         be determined by the Board of Directors of Bancorp on the basis of such
         factors as it deems relevant.

7.       Terms of Options.  The term of each option  shall be for such period as
         the Board  shall  determine,  but not more than ten (10) years (or five
         (5) years in the case of an option granted to a 10%  Shareholder)  from
         the date of grant thereof,  and shall be subject to earlier termination
         as  hereinafter  provided.  If the original  term of any option is less
         than ten (10) years (or five (5) years in the case of an option granted
         to a 10%  Shareholder)  from the date of grant, the option prior to its
         expiration  may be  amended,  with the  approval  of the  Board and the
         employee  or  director,  to  extend  the term to not more than ten (10)
         years  (or five (5)  years in the case of an  option  granted  to a 10%
         Shareholder) from the original date of granting of such options. Except
         as otherwise  required by law, such extension  shall not constitute the
         grant of a new option and the purchase  price  specified in such option
         need not be modified.

8.       Conditions to the Exercisability of Options. The Board may, in its sole
         discretion set conditions  that must be satisfied  before an option may
         be  exercised.  These  conditions  may be  based on the  length  of the
         optionee's continuous employment with the Corporation subsequent to the
         grant, the job performance of the optionee subsequent to the grant, the
         performance  of the  Corporation  as a whole,  or any other  reasonable
         criteria.  The Board shall determine in each case annually whether such
         conditions  have been  satisfied  for the preceding  fiscal year.  With
         respect  to  performance-related  conditions,  the Board  shall fix the
         number of shares,  if any, as to which each  outstanding  option  shall
         then become exercisable.  No such option subject to performance-related
         conditions shall become exercisable until the Board (a) determines that
         such  conditions  have been satisfied  during the fiscal year preceding
         such  determination  and (b) fixes the number of shares as to which the
         option shall thereupon  become  exercisable.  The aggregate fair market
         value  (as of the date of  grant)  of such  options  exercisable  by an
         individual  for the first time in any calendar  year under the Plan and
         any other  incentive stock option plan of the Corporation or any parent
         or subsidiary corporation shall not exceed $100,000.

9.       Exercise of Options. Unless otherwise provided in the option agreement,
         a holder of an option may  purchase  all, or from time to time any part
         of, the shares of which the right to purchase has accrued in accordance
         with the terms of paragraph 8; provided,  however, that an option shall
         not be exercised as to fewer than fifty (50) shares,  or the  remaining
         shares covered by the option if fewer than fifty (50), at any one time.
         The  purchase  price  of the  shares  as to which  an  option  shall be
         exercised shall be paid in full at the time of exercise at the election
         of the holder of an option (a) in cash or by  certified  check,  (b) by
         tendering to Bancorp shares of

                                        3

<PAGE>

         Bancorp's  Common Stock,  then owned by him, having a fair market value
         equal to the cash exercise  price  applicable to the purchase  price of
         the shares as to which an option is being  exercised,  or (c) partly in
         cash and  partly in shares of  Bancorp's  Common  Stock  valued at fair
         market value determined as of the close of the business day immediately
         preceding the day on which the option is  exercised,  in the manner set
         forth in paragraph 6. Fractional  shares of Common Stock valued at fair
         market value will not be issued.  Except as provided in  paragraphs  11
         and 12 hereof, no option may be exercised at any time unless the holder
         thereof is then an employee or  director of the  Corporation  or one of
         its subsidiaries. The holder of an option shall have none of the rights
         of a  stockholder  with  respect to the shares  subject to option until
         such shares shall have been registered on the transfer books of Bancorp
         in the name of such holder.

         Notwithstanding  any other provision of this Plan or any option granted
         hereunder, any option granted hereunder and then outstanding may become
         immediately exercisable in full, in the discretion of the Board, in the
         event of a "Change  of  Control".  For  purposes  hereof,  (a) the term
         "Control"  shall have the same  meaning as is ascribed  thereto in Rule
         12b-2 of the Rules and  Regulations  promulgated  by the Securities and
         Exchange Commission pursuant to the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and
         (b) an  event  or  events  constituting  a  Change  of  Control  of the
         Corporation  shall  be  deemed  to have  occurred  on such  date as the
         Corporation  shall  file,  or  shall  have  become  obligated  to file,
         whichever is earlier,  a Current Report on Form 8-K describing any such
         Change of  Control  of the  Corporation  pursuant  to Item 1 thereof or
         indicating  that any such  Change of Control  either is imminent or may
         have occurred. The Committee may adopt such procedures as to notice and
         exercise as may be  necessary to  effectuate  the  acceleration  of the
         exercisability of options as described above.

10.      Non-transferability  of Options. An option granted under the Plan shall
         not be  transferable  otherwise than by will or the laws of descent and
         distribution,  and an option may be  exercised,  during the lifetime of
         the employee, only by the employee.

11.      Termination  of  Employment.  In the event  that the  employment  of an
         employee,  or the incumbency of a director,  to whom an option has been
         granted  under the Plan shall be  terminated  (other  than by reason of
         death or  disability),  such  option may subject to the  provisions  of
         paragraph 8 be  exercised,  to the extent that the employee or director
         was  entitled  to do so at the  date of such  termination,  at any time
         within three (3) months after such  termination,  but in no event after
         the  expiration  of the term of the option.  Options  granted under the
         Plan shall not be affected by any changes of duties or position so long
         as  the  holder  continues  to  be  an  employee  or  director  of  the
         Corporation.  Retirement  pursuant to any pension plan  provided by the
         Corporation  shall be deemed to be a termination  of employment for the
         purposes  of this  paragraph  11.  Nothing in the Plan or in any option
         granted  pursuant to the Plan shall  confer upon any employee any right
         to  continue in the employ of the  Corporation  or  interfere  with the
         right of the Corporation to terminate his employment at any time.

12.      Death or Disability of Employee.  If an employee or director to whom an
         option has been  granted  under the Plan  shall die or become  disabled
         within  the  meaning  of Section  422 of the Code,  such  option may be
         exercised  subject  to the  provisions  of  paragraphs  8 and 9, to the
         extent that the  employee or director was entitled to do so at the date
         of such  death or  disability,  by the  employee  or  director,  or the
         representative of the employee's or director's estate, at any

                                        4

<PAGE>
         time within such period, not exceeding one (1) year after such death or
         commencement  of  disability,  as shall  be  prescribed  in the  option
         agreement,  but in no event  after  the  expiration  of the term of the
         option.

13.      Adjustments Upon Changes in Capitalization.  Notwithstanding  any other
         provision of the Plan, the Board, as it deems  appropriate,  may adjust
         the number and class of shares covered by each outstanding  option, the
         option  prices,  and the minimum  number of shares as to which  options
         shall be  exercisable  at any one time in the event of  changes  in the
         outstanding  Common  Stock by  reason  of Stock  dividends,  split-ups,
         recapitalizations,  mergers, consolidations,  combinations or exchanges
         of shares  and the like;  and,  in the event of any such  change in the
         outstanding  Common  Stock,  the  aggregate  number and class of shares
         available  under the Plan and the maximum  number of shares as to which
         options may be granted shall be appropriately adjusted.

14.      No  Loans  to  Holders  of  Options.  Neither  Bancorp  nor  any of its
         subsidiaries  may directly or  indirectly  lend money to any person for
         the purpose of assisting  such person to acquire or carry shares of the
         Common  Stock  issued upon the  exercise of options  granted  under the
         Plan.

15.      Time of Granting Options. The date of grant of an option under the Plan
         shall,  for all  purposes,  be the date on which  the  Board  makes the
         determination  granting such option.  Notice of the determination shall
         be given to each  employee  to whom an  option is so  granted  within a
         reasonable time after the date of such grant.

16.      Termination  and Amendment of the Plan.  Unless the Plan has previously
         been  terminated,  no option shall be granted  hereunder  after May 24,
         2005.  The Board may at any time prior to that date  terminate the Plan
         or make such  modification  or  amendment  of the Plan as it shall deem
         advisable; provided, however, that no amendment may be made to the Plan
         without the approval by the holders of Common Stock, except as provided
         in  paragraphs  7 or 13 hereof,  that would (i)  increase  the  maximum
         number of shares for which options may be granted under the Plan,  (ii)
         change the manner of  determining  the  minimum  option  prices,  (iii)
         extend the period  during which an option may be granted or  exercised,
         or (iv) amend the requirements as to the class of employees eligible to
         receive options. No termination, modification, or amendment of the Plan
         may,  without  the  consent  of the  employee  to whom an option  shall
         theretofore  have  been  granted,  adversely  affect  the right of such
         employee under such option.

17.      Government Regulations.  The Plan and the grant and exercise of options
         thereunder,  and the  obligation of Bancorp to sell and deliver  shares
         under such options,  shall be subject to all applicable laws, rules and
         regulations.
