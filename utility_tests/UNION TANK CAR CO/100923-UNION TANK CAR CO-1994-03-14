ITEM 1.  BUSINESS

General

UNION TANK CAR COMPANY, with its wholly-owned subsidiaries (herein collectively
referred to, unless the context otherwise requires, as the "Company") was
organized under the laws of Delaware on September 23, 1980 and is the successor
to a business which was originally incorporated in New Jersey in 1891.  The
Company is a wholly-owned subsidiary of Marmon Industrial Corporation, an
indirect wholly-owned subsidiary of Marmon Holdings, Inc. ("Holdings").
Substantially all of the stock of Holdings is owned, directly or indirectly, by
trusts for the benefit of certain members of the Pritzker family.  As used
herein, "Pritzker family" refers to the lineal descendants of Nicholas J.
Pritzker, deceased.

Railcar Leasing, Services and Sales

The principal activity of the Company is the leasing of railway tank cars and
other railcars to United States, Canadian and Mexican manufacturers and other
shippers of chemicals products, including liquid fertilizers, petroleum
products, including liquefied petroleum gas, food products and bulk plastics.
The Company owns and operates one of the largest fleets of privately-owned
railway tank cars in the world.

As of December 31, 1993, the Company's fleet was comprised of approximately
51,000 tank cars and 13,500 railway cars of other types.  Approximately 22,260
cars were added to the lease fleet during the ten years ended December 31, 1993.
These cars accounted for approximately 38% of total lease revenues during 1993.
Most of the Company's cars were built by the Company or to its specifications
and the balance were purchased from other sources.

The Company added approximately 2,630 new cars to its lease fleet during 1993,
including approximately 2,290 tank cars with an average capacity of
approximately 23,560 gallons, and approximately 2,100 new cars during 1992,
including approximately 1,900 tank cars with an average capacity of
approximately 23,850 gallons.  During 1993 the Company sold or retired
approximately 1,310 cars, including approximately 850 tank cars with an average
capacity of approximately 14,940 gallons, and during 1992 the Company sold or
retired approximately 2,660 cars, including approximately 1,200 tank cars with
an average capacity of approximately 13,650 gallons.

Management estimates that tank cars carrying chemicals and acids account for the
greatest portion of total leasing revenues, followed in order by compressed
gases (particularly liquefied petroleum gas and anhydrous ammonia), refined
petroleum products (such as gasoline, fuel oils and asphalt), food products and
liquid fertilizers.

A significant portion of the revenues from the Company's non-tank car fleet
derives from hopper cars carrying bulk plastics.  The remaining non-tank car
revenues are attributable to cars which serve the lumber, dry bulk chemical,
coal and sulphur industries.

                                      -2-

The Company builds tank cars primarily for use in its leasing business.  In
addition, the Company builds cars for sale to others.  Generally, the Company
only manufactures a car following the receipt of a firm order for the lease or
sale of such car.  During 1993, 1992 and 1991, the Company manufactured an
aggregate of approximately 2,450, 2,260 and 2,110 tank cars, respectively, of
which approximately one-third were sold to third parties.

Substantially all of the Company's cars are leased directly to several hundred
manufacturers and other shippers under leases covering from one to several
thousand cars and for periods ranging from one to twenty years.  The average
term of leases entered into during 1993 for newly-manufactured cars was
approximately seven years.  The average term of leases entered into during 1993
for other cars was approximately four years.  Under the terms of most leases the
Company agrees to provide a full range of services, including car repair and
maintenance.  The Company supplies relatively few cars directly to railroads.

The Company markets its cars through regional sales offices located throughout
the United States and Canada and through a sales agent in Mexico.  To insure
optimum utilization of the U.S., Canadian and Mexican lease fleets, the Company
maintains fleet data processing systems which contain information relative to
each car, including its mechanical specifications, maintenance and repair data
and lease terms.

The Company has generally followed the practice of financing additions to its
fleet by borrowing 75% to 80% of the funds required through the issuance of
equipment obligations.  The Company's long-term equipment obligations are
generally payable over a period of fifteen to twenty years, which is
considerably less than the estimated useful life of the equipment.  In addition,
in 1992 the Company entered into ten separate sale-leaseback transactions
pursuant to which it sold and leased back (under operating leases) an aggregate
of approximately 2,100 railcars.  The average term of the Company's leases (as
lessor) is substantially less than the average maturity of the equipment
obligations and the average terms of the operating leases (as lessee); however,
the aggregate rentals to be received in the future under existing leases are
substantial and exceed the total of the principal payments due under the
equipment obligations and the minimum lease payments due (as lessee) under the
operating leases.  The following table sets forth the minimum rentals to be
received in relation to the debt maturities under outstanding equipment
obligations, the minimum lease payments due (as lessee) under all operating
leases and the cost of the fleet.  The table excludes outstanding commercial
paper and, for periods prior to January, 1990, excludes reductions in the
Company's advances to its parent, both of which were used as interim financing
for additions to the Company's railcar fleet.  The figures shown are the minimum
future rentals under leases in effect at the dates indicated.  Based upon its
historical experience, the Company expects that the cars (other than those which
are retired in the ordinary course of business) will be re-leased at the
expiration of such leases.  The rentals under such future leases and related
interest and other expenses to be incurred in the future cannot be ascertained
and therefore are not reflected in this table.

  (1)  Includes $143.0 million principal amount of unsecured senior notes issued
       by the Company in 1990, the proceeds of which were used to retire certain
       higher coupon railcar obligations.

Approximately 62% of the Company-owned fleet of railcars is pledged to secure
equipment obligations.  The remaining cars are free of liens.

The Company maintains repair facilities located at strategic points throughout
the United States and Canada.  In addition to the work performed by the Company,
certain maintenance and repair work is performed for the Company's account by
railroads, when railroad inspection determines the need for such work under the
code of the Association of American Railroads ("AAR").

                                      -4-
<PAGE>
    
The Company is not a common carrier and is not subject to regulation or
supervision by the Interstate Commerce Commission.  The Company's railcars are
subject to regulations governing construction, safety and maintenance
promulgated by the Department of Transportation ("DOT") and various other
government agencies and by the AAR.  These regulations have required and may in
the future require the Company to make significant modifications to certain of
its cars from time to time.

The Company's principal facilities for manufacturing and assembling tank cars
are located in East Chicago, Indiana and Oakville, Ontario, Canada.  The Company
also operates a network of shops for repairing and servicing railcars, with the
principal shops located in Valdosta, Georgia; Muscatine, Iowa; El Dorado,
Kansas; Ville Platte, Louisiana; Marion, Ohio; Altoona, Pennsylvania; Cleveland
and Longview, Texas; Edmonton, Alberta; Sarnia and Oakville, Ontario; Montreal,
Quebec; and Regina, Saskatchewan.  In addition, on January 13, 1994, the Company
purchased certain assets, located in Sheldon, Texas, that were used in the
repair of railcars and other assets that were in the past used to manufacture
railcars.

Other Activities

The Company is engaged in several other activities, as described below.

Fasteners

The Company's fastener business, which is conducted through several wholly-owned
subsidiaries, consists of manufacturing and distributing a wide range of

Intersegment sales are immaterial.  Segment operating income includes segment
revenue less operating expenses directly traceable to the segment and an
allocation of common expenses benefiting more than one segment.

Major Customers

Revenues from any one customer did not exceed 4% of consolidated or industry
segment revenues.

Raw Materials

The Company purchases raw materials from a variety of suppliers, with no one
supplier in any industry segment being significant.  In the opinion of
management the Company will have adequate availability of applicable raw
materials in the future.

Foreign Operations

The Company does not believe that there are unusual risks attendant to its
foreign operations.

                                      -7-
<PAGE>
 
Competition

All the activities of the Company are in competition with similar activities
carried on by other companies.  In particular, there are several companies
engaged in the business of leasing tank cars in the United States and Canada.
The largest competitor is General American Transportation Corporation (including
its Canadian affiliate, Canadian General Transit Company, Limited).  The other
principal competitors in the tank car business are ACF Industries, Incorporated,
and General Electric Railcar Services Corporation.  The principal competitive
factors are price, service and product design.

Manufacturing Backlog

The Company builds tank cars primarily for use in its leasing business and the
number of cars added in any one year is a small fraction of the Company's total
fleet.  Additionally, for tank cars built for sale to customers, the Company
delivers against orders within a relatively brief period of time.  Therefore,
backlog is not material to the Company's business or an understanding thereof.

Employees

As of December 31, 1993, the Company had approximately 3,570 employees.

Environmental Matters

The Company believes that all of its facilities are in substantial compliance
with applicable laws and regulations relating to environmental protection.  Over
the past several years the Company has attempted to identify and remediate
potential problem areas.  In 1993 the Company spent approximately $4.7 million
on remediation and related matters, compared with $3.7 and $2.8 million in 1992
and 1991, respectively.  The Company expects to spend approximately $8 million
in 1994 on similar activities, including approximately $3 million for capital
expenditures.  The Company has approximately $2.5 million accrued for
environmental liabilities at December 31, 1993, and management currently
believes this accrual is adequate.

In October, 1990, the Pennsylvania Office of Attorney General and the
Pennsylvania Department of Environmental Resources ("DER") commenced an
investigation of alleged violations of the Pennsylvania Solid Waste Management
Act with respect to the handling of solid and hazardous waste material at the
Company's railcar repair facility in Altoona, Pennsylvania.  The Board of
Directors of the Company authorized special counsel to conduct an internal
investigation of the allegations made against the Altoona facility.  The Company
is satisfied with current operations at the facility.

The Pennsylvania DER has requested that the Company cooperate voluntarily in a
site assessment of areas of potential environmental contamination at the
facility.  The Pennsylvania Attorney General's office has advised the Company's
counsel that it would like to discuss an amicable resolution of the criminal
investigation.  The Company is unable to predict whether satisfactory settlement
of the allegations will occur, whether the Pennsylvania authorities will go
forward with their investigations, or whether any civil or criminal proceedings
will be initiated against it.

In March, 1993, the EPA filed an administrative complaint alleging the Company
violated certain inspection, recordkeeping, and other requirements of the Toxic
Substances Control Act with respect to electrical transformers containing PCB
fluids at the Company's East Chicago, Indiana facility.  The EPA proposed a
penalty of $103,400 with respect to the alleged violations.  The Company has
answered the complaint and raised certain defenses.  The Company has been
engaged in informal settlement negotiations.  The matter is still under
discussion.

In June, 1993, the EPA filed an administrative complaint alleging the Company
violated (S)313 of the Emergency Planning and Community Right-to-Know Act of
1986 by failing to submit Toxic Chemical Release Inventory Reporting Forms
relating to its use of certain chemicals in manufacturing operations at its East
Chicago, Indiana facility during calendar years 1987-1990.  The EPA proposed a
civil penalty in the amount of $524,000.  The Company has denied the allegations
of the complaint and has requested a formal hearing to contest the EPA's
allegations and the proposed penalty.  The Company is engaging in informal
settlement negotiations with the EPA.

In August, 1992, the EPA issued an administrative order alleging that the
Company discharged waste waters containing pollutants in excess of permissible
amounts in violation of the Clean Water Act and the terms of three industrial
waste water discharge permits held by the Company at its East Chicago, Indiana
facility.  In July, 1993, the EPA issued a new administrative order which, in
part, extended the pretreatment standards compliance deadline to February, 1994
and set forth a compliance schedule for the completion of a new pretreatment
system at this facility.  Other reporting and monitoring requirements of the
prior administrative order were retained.  The Company is complying with the
terms of the new administrative order.

The Company has been designated as a Potentially Responsible Party by the EPA at
five sites:  American Chemical Services, Inc., Griffith, IN; Auto Ion Chemical
Company, Kalamazoo, MI; Douglassville Disposal Site, Union Township, PA;
Whitehouse Waste Oil Pits Site, Jacksonville, FL; and Grandville Solvents Site,
Grandville, OH.  Costs incurred to date have not been material, either
individually or in the aggregate.  Because of the Company's minimal involvement
at these sites, management of the Company believes that future costs related to
these sites will not be material, either individually or in the aggregate.

Management of the Company does not anticipate that the resolution of any of the
matters discussed above will have a material adverse affect on the Company's
results of operations, financial condition or business.


ITEM 2.  PROPERTIES

In the opinion of management, the Company's properties are substantially
adequate and suitable for their intended use.

Railcars

The Company owns approximately 95 percent of its total lease fleet of 64,500
railcars, of which 51,000 are tank cars and 13,500 are other railway freight
cars.  Of the approximately 61,360 owned cars, 23,500 are free of liens.  Cars
which are not owned are leased from others under long-term net leases.

                                      -9-

<PAGE>
 
Car Servicing and Repair Shops

The Company operates a network of shops for repairing and servicing railcars.
The principal shops owned by the Company are located at Valdosta, Georgia;
Muscatine, Iowa; El Dorado, Kansas; Ville Platte, Louisiana; Marion, Ohio;
Altoona, Pennsylvania; Cleveland, Sheldon and Longview, Texas; Edmonton,
Alberta; and Oakville, Ontario.  Several other repair shops and small repair
points are strategically located throughout the United States and Canada.

At any one time, less than 3.0% of the cars in the lease fleet are normally in
the Company's shops for repair and maintenance.

Railcar Manufacturing and Assembling Facilities

The Company's plants for the manufacturing and assembling of tank cars are
located at East Chicago, Indiana and Oakville, Ontario, together occupying
approximately 130 acres.

Liquefied Petroleum Gas Storage Facilities

A subsidiary of the Company owns several underground liquefied petroleum gas
storage caverns in Canada.

Other Properties

In connection with its other business activities, the Company owns (either
directly or through its subsidiaries) fastener manufacturing facilities in
Ashland, Ohio; Milton, Ontario; and Montreal, Quebec.   In addition,
subsidiaries of the Company which manufacture fasteners lease several small
plants in the United States and Canada.  The Company and its subsidiaries
maintain numerous sales and business offices and warehouses, most of which are
leased, throughout the United States and Canada.

ITEM 3.  LEGAL PROCEEDINGS

The Company and its subsidiaries have been named as defendants in a number of
lawsuits and certain claims are pending.  The Company has accrued what it
reasonably expects to pay to resolve such claims (including legal fees), and, in
the opinion of management, ultimate resolution of these matters will not have a
material effect on the Company's consolidated financial position or results of
operations.  See discussion of Environmental Matters in ITEM 1.

services and net sales. 1990 net income included a $15.3 million extraordinary
loss on retirement of debt.


ITEM 7.  MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION
         AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

1993 versus 1992

Results of Operations
- ---------------------

Service revenues increased $19.4 million primarily due to the effect of cars
added to the railcar lease fleet since 1992 and higher repair revenues offset
slightly by lower revenues from sulphur service operations.   Gross profit was
relatively unchanged from 1992.

In June, 1992, the Company entered into ten separate sale-leaseback transactions
in which it sold for $124.9 million an aggregate of 2,073 railcars.  Excluding
these 1992 sale-leaseback transactions, net sales revenues in 1993 decreased
approximately $7.7 million due to lower railcar and sulphur plant sales.

Other income decreased $4.4 million due to reduced interest income resulting
from lower interest rates as well as lower average outstanding balance on
advances to the Company's parent.

Interest expense decreased $8.8 million primarily due to a decline in the
average outstanding commercial paper balance as well as a lower average
effective interest rate on debt outstanding.

Provision for income taxes increased due to the effect of the increase in the
federal statutory tax rate.

                                      -11-
<PAGE>
 
Net income in 1993 included an $80.0 million credit to earnings for the
cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle related to accounting for
income taxes.  See further discussion under "Change in Accounting Principles"
below.

Financial Condition
- -------------------

Operating activities provided $183.8 million of cash in 1993.  These funds,
along with the commercial paper borrowings, net of amounts advanced to parent,
were used to provide interim financing for railcar additions, service long-term
debt and pay dividends to the Company's stockholder.  It is the Company's policy
to pay a quarterly dividend to its stockholder equal to 70% of net income.  To
the extent that the Company generates cash in excess of its operating needs,
such funds are advanced to its parent and bear interest at commercial rates.
Conversely, when the Company requires additional funds to support its
operations, prior advances are repaid by its parent.  No restrictions exist
regarding the amount of dividends which may be paid or advances which may be
made by the Company to its parent.

Management expects future cash to be provided by operating activities,
commercial paper borrowings and long-term railcar financings will be adequate to
provide for the continued expansion of the Company's business and enable it to
meet its debt service obligations.

The Company also has a $150.0 million liquidity back-up revolving credit
facility supporting the commercial paper programs.  However, no borrowings have
occurred under this facility and none are currently anticipated.

In 1993, the Company spent $175.8 million for the construction and purchase of
railcars and other fixed assets.  The Company received $15.1 million in proceeds
from disposals of railcars and other fixed assets.  The Company also decreased
its advance to its parent company by $89.2 million.  Overall, net cash used in
investing activities was $72.8 million.

In May, 1993, the Company issued $100.0 million in long-term equipment trust
pass through certificates to finance additions to its railcar fleet at an annual
interest rate of 6.5%.  Other financing activities of the Company included $8.4
million for the repayment of commercial paper obligations, $78.8 million for
principal repayments on debt, $17.7 million to repay an advance to an affiliate
and $90.0 million for dividends.  Net cash used in financing activities was
$94.9 million.

As more fully discussed in note 21 to the consolidated financial statements, on
January 13, 1994, the Company acquired certain assets located in Sheldon, Texas
for approximately $24.3 million.  In addition, on March 2, 1994, the Company
issued $100.0 million in long-term equipment trust certificates to finance
additions to its railcar fleet at an annual interest rate of 6.6%.

The Company has not experienced any significant impact of inflation and changing
prices on its financial position or results of operations over the last several
years.

1992 versus 1991

Results of Operations
- ---------------------

Revenues from railcar services increased $15.0 million from 1991 primarily due
to the impact of cars added to the railcar lease fleet during 1991 and 1992.
Other service revenues, primarily sulphur processing, decreased $4.8 million.

                                      -12-

<PAGE>
 
On June 30, 1992, the Company entered into ten separate sale-leaseback
transactions with trusts for the benefit of certain institutional investors
pursuant to which it sold (at approximately book value) an aggregate of 2,073
railcars, including 1,570 tank cars.  As a result of these transactions, the
Company recorded sales revenue of $124.9 million.  The sale-leaseback
transactions therefore account for the $124.4 million increase in consolidated
net sales revenues in 1992 as compared to 1991.

Other income decreased $14.7 million primarily due to lower interest income
resulting from lower interest rates on advances to the Company's parent.

Income taxes as a percentage of income before taxes decreased due to reduced
effective tax rates on foreign income.

Financial Condition
- -------------------

Operating activities provided $175.6 million of cash.  These funds, along with
the commercial paper borrowings, net of amounts advanced to parent, were used to
provide interim financing for railcar additions, service long-term debt and pay
dividends to the Company's stockholder.

As discussed above, the Company entered into ten separate sale-leaseback
transactions that provided aggregate sales revenue of $124.9 million.  Net of
$145.9 million spent for the construction and purchase of railcars and other
fixed assets, and $71.1 million provided by other investing activities, net cash
provided by investing activities was $50.1 million.

The Company did not enter into any new railcar debt financing in 1992.  The
Company spent $104.3 million for the repayment of commercial paper obligations,
$72.3 million for principal repayments on debt and $33.0 million for dividends.

Changes in Accounting Principles
- --------------------------------

As more fully discussed in note 9 to the consolidated financial statements,
effective January 1, 1993 the Company adopted Statement of Financial Accounting
Standards (SFAS) No. 109, "Accounting for Income Taxes."  The cumulative effect
of the adoption of this new standard resulted in a $80.0 million credit to
earnings in 1993.  The new standard, however, had no effect on the Company's
cash flow.

The Financial Accounting Standards Board has issued SFAS No. 112, "Employers'
Accounting for Postemployment Benefits."  This statement will have no material
impact on the Company's financial position or results of operations since the
Company's employee benefit programs do not include significant postemployment
benefits.

The Financial Accounting Standards Board has also issued SFAS No. 115,
"Accounting for Certain Investments in Debt and Equity Securities."  However,
since the Company does not currently have investments in these types of
securities, there will be no impact on the Company's consolidated financial
statements.

Other Matters
- -------------

The Company has certain environmental matters currently outstanding, none of
which are significant to the Company's results of operations or financial
condition, either individually or in the aggregate.  See further discussion of
such matters under the "Environmental Matters" caption of Item 1 of this Form
10-K.

                         REPORT OF INDEPENDENT AUDITORS


TO UNION TANK CAR COMPANY

We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheet of Union Tank Car
Company and subsidiaries as of December 31, 1993 and 1992, and the related
consolidated statements of income, stockholder's equity and cash flows for each
of the three years in the period ended December 31, 1993.  Our audits also
included the financial statement schedules listed in the Index at Item 14
(a)(2).  These financial statements and schedules are the responsibility of the
Company's management.  Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these
financial statements and schedules based on our audits.

We conducted our audits in accordance with generally accepted auditing
standards.  Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material
misstatement.  An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting
the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements.  An audit also includes
assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by
management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation.
We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.

In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present
fairly, in all material respects, the consolidated financial position of Union
Tank Car Company and subsidiaries at December 31, 1993 and 1992, and the
consolidated results of their operations and their cash flows for each of the
three years in the period ended December 31, 1993, in conformity with generally
accepted accounting principles.  Also, in our opinion, the related financial
statement schedules, when considered in relation to the basic financial
statements taken as a whole, present fairly in all material respects the
information set forth therein.

As discussed in Note 9 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company
changed its method of accounting for income taxes in the year ended December 31,
1993.

1.  Ownership

UNION TANK CAR COMPANY, with its wholly-owned subsidiaries (herein collectively
referred to, unless the context otherwise requires, as the "Company") is a
wholly-owned subsidiary of Marmon Industrial Corporation ("MIC") and an indirect
subsidiary of Marmon Holdings, Inc. ("Holdings").  Substantially all of the
stock of Holdings is owned, directly or indirectly, by trusts for the benefit of
certain members of the Pritzker family.  As used herein, "Pritzker family"
refers to the lineal descendants of Nicholas J. Pritzker, deceased.

2.  Summary of Accounting Principles and Practices

  Principles of Consolidation

The accompanying consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the
Company and all subsidiaries.  All significant intercompany accounts and
transactions have been eliminated.

  Lessor Accounting

Operating Leases - Most of the Company's railcar leases are classified as
operating leases.  Aggregate rentals from operating leases are reported as
revenue ratably over the life of the lease.  Expenses, including depreciation
and maintenance, are charged against such revenues as incurred.

Direct Financing Leases - Some of the Company's railcar leases and other rental
equipment are classified as direct financing leases.  Gross investment in leases
(minimum lease payments plus estimated residual values) less the cost of the
equipment is designated as unearned income.  This unearned income is recognized
over the life of the lease based upon the "constant yield method" or similar
methods which generally result in an approximate level rate of return on the
investment.

  Depreciation and Fixed Assets Accounting

Railcars and fixed assets are recorded at cost less accumulated depreciation.
These assets are depreciated to salvage value over their estimated useful lives
on the straight-line method.  The estimated useful lives are principally:
railcars, 20-30 years; buildings and improvements, 20-30 years; and machinery
and equipment, 4-25 years.

The cost of major conversions and betterments are capitalized and depreciated
over their estimated useful life or, if shorter, the remaining useful life of
the related asset.  Maintenance and repairs are charged to expense when
incurred.  Gain or loss on disposals is included in other income, except for
railcar disposals which are included in cost of services.

             NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)


  Deferred Income Taxes

The Company provides deferred taxes for temporary differences between pre-tax
accounting income and taxable income (principally related to railcar
depreciation).

  Deferred Investment Tax Credits

United States investment tax credits (as generated through 1986 and to the
extent not transferred to lessees) and Canadian investment tax credits result in
a reduction of current or deferred income taxes and are due primarily to
investments in certain new railcars.  Investment tax credits retained are
deferred and amortized over the estimated useful lives of the related assets.

  Foreign Currency Translation

All assets and liabilities are translated at exchange rates in effect at the
date of translation.  Average exchange rates are used for revenues, costs and
expenses and income taxes.

Translation adjustments and transaction gains and losses are assumed by the
Company's parent.  For the years ended December 31, 1993 and 1992, MIC absorbed
gains of $57 and $140, respectively.  For the year ended December 31, 1991, MIC
absorbed a loss of $79.

  Inventories

Inventories are stated at the lower of cost (first-in, first-out) or market.

  Statement of Cash Flows

For purposes of reporting cash flows, cash and cash equivalents includes all
highly liquid debt instruments purchased with an original maturity of three
months or less.

  Fair Value of Financial Instruments

All book value amounts for financial instruments approximate the instruments'
fair value except for the borrowed debt discussed in Note 8.

  Reclassification

Certain prior year amounts have been reclassified to conform to the current
year's presentation.

3.  Railcar Lease Data

Railcars are leased directly to several hundred shippers, located throughout the
United States, Canada and Mexico.  The Company leases to a wide variety of
customers, and no customer accounted for more than 4% of consolidated lease
revenues.  The leases involve one to several thousand cars, normally for periods
ranging from one to twenty years.  The average term of leases entered into
during 1993 for newly-manufactured cars was approximately seven years.  The
average term of leases entered into during 1993 for other cars was approximately
four years.  Under the terms of most of the leases the Company agrees to provide
a full range of services including car repair and maintenance.

Minimum future rentals to be received on railcar leases at December 31, 1993,
are as follows:

On June 30, 1992, the Company entered into ten separate sale-leaseback
transactions with trusts for the benefit of certain institutional investors
pursuant to which it sold (at approximately book value) and leased back an
aggregate of 2,073 railcars, including 1,570 tank cars.  The Company may
reacquire the railcars subject to one or more of the leases by purchasing the
beneficial interests in the related trusts at fair value on January 2, 2009 in
the case of four leases and January 2, 2010 in the case of the other six leases.
Each lease expires on January 2, 2014.

Equipment obligations above include $7,667 and $9,081 of capitalized leases and
are secured by railcars with an original cost of $1,597,476 and $1,497,439 at
December 31, 1993 and 1992, respectively.  The senior notes contain certain
provisions regarding asset sales and sale-leaseback restrictions.  As of
December 31, 1993, the Company is in compliance with all debt covenants.

In January, 1990, the Company began issuing commercial paper.  As a liquidity
back-up to the issuance of commercial paper, the Company and MIC entered into a
revolving credit agreement, as amended, with several banks that provides
aggregate short-term commitments of up to $150 million.  Under the credit
agreement, loans with maturities of up to six months may be issued.  Under the
terms of the credit agreement the Company must maintain available unused credit
thereunder equal to 100% of the commercial paper outstanding at any time.  The
restrictive covenants under the credit agreement require MIC, among other
things, to maintain consolidated net worth at specified minimum levels and
achieve defined levels of cash flow from operations.  The Company is not
separately subject to these covenants.  The Company's debt under the credit
agreement is guaranteed by MIC but the Company does not guarantee MIC's debt
under the credit agreement.  MIC does not guarantee payment of the Company's
commercial paper indebtedness.  Interest rates on the commercial paper and on
the debt under the credit agreement are based on rates in effect at the time the
commercial paper is placed or the debt is incurred.  Expenses associated with
the credit agreement (approximately $370 in 1993 and $300 in 1992) are included
in interest expense.  The credit agreement expires in May, 1995.  The Company
has no amounts outstanding under the credit agreement at December 31, 1993.  The
Company's Canadian subsidiaries have approximately $13,817 of credit lines
available on a no-charge basis.  No amounts were outstanding as of December 31,
1993.

Maturities of debt obligations for the years 1994 - 1998 are $577,690, as
follows:  $81,591 in 1994, $125,843 in 1995, $74,570 in 1996, $218,599 in 1997
and $77,087 in 1998.

The current fair value of the Company's borrowed debt is estimated by
discounting the future interest and principal cash flows at the Company's
estimated incremental borrowing rate at the respective year-end for debt with
similar maturities.  The Company currently anticipates holding all borrowed debt
obligations until maturity.

9.  Income Taxes

The Company is included in the consolidated U.S. federal income tax return of
Holdings.  Under an arrangement with MIC, federal income taxes, before
consideration of investment tax credits, are computed as if the Company files a
separate consolidated return.  For this computation, the Company generally uses
tax accounting methods which minimize the current tax liability (these methods
may differ from those used in the consolidated tax return).  Tax liabilities are
remitted to, and refunds are obtained from, MIC on this basis.  If deductions
and credits available to Holdings' entire consolidated group exceed those which
can be used on the return, allocation of the related benefits between the
Company and others will be at the sole discretion of Holdings.  As a member of a
consolidated federal income tax group, the Company is contingently liable for
the federal income taxes of the other members of the group.

Effective January 1, 1993, the Company prospectively adopted the provisions of
Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 109, "Accounting for Income
Taxes," (SFAS 109) and, accordingly, changed from the deferred method to the
asset and liability approach to accounting for income taxes.  The cumulative
effect of this accounting change as of that date is reflected in the
accompanying consolidated statement of income as an $80,000 credit to earnings
for the cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle.  This item
represents a non-cash credit to earnings, as it merely reflects the new, lower
net deferred income tax liability calculated under the new accounting method as
compared to the net liability recorded under the former income tax accounting
method.  Adoption of the new accounting method did not change the tax
arrangement with MIC, had no effect on income before taxes and cumulative effect
of a change in accounting principle and has no past or future impact on the cash
flows related to income taxes.

             NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)


Under the provisions of the Revenue Reconciliation Act of 1993 (enacted on
August 10, 1993) the corporate federal income tax rate increased from 34% to
35%, effective January 1, 1993.  The rate change increased the 1993 provision
for income taxes $7,300 due to the effect of the increased tax rate on the net
deferred income tax liability which existed as of the enactment date of the law.

Deferred income taxes reflect the net tax effects of temporary differences
between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial reporting
purposes and the amounts used for income tax purposes.  The December 31, 1993
net deferred income tax liability of $451,812 shown in the accompanying
consolidated balance sheet is composed of $492,225 in deferred tax liabilities,
partially offset by $40,413 in deferred tax assets.  These deferred income tax
assets and (liabilities) result from the following temporary differences:

</TABLE>

The above assets exclude certain state deferred income tax assets related to
loss carryforwards (which expire over the next fifteen years) in the gross
amount of $14,000.  These assets have been assigned a 100% valuation reserve due
to significant uncertainty as to ultimate realizability.   There have been no
changes in any asset valuation reserves for the year ended December 31, 1993.

Undistributed earnings of the Company's non-U.S. subsidiaries reflect full
provision for non-U.S. income taxes.   However, since the earnings are
indefinitely reinvested in non-U.S. operations, no provision has been made for
taxes that might be payable upon remittance of such earnings nor is it
practicable to determine the amount of any such liability.

10. Contingencies

The Company and its subsidiaries have been named as defendants in a number of
lawsuits and certain claims are pending.  The Company has accrued what it
reasonably expects to pay to resolve such claims, and, in the opinion of
management, their ultimate resolution will not have a material effect on the
Company's consolidated financial position or results of operations.

The Company self-insures certain exposures in its risk management plan.  The
Company has accrued for the estimated costs of reported, as well as incurred but
not reported, self-insured claims.

The company has certain environmental matters currently outstanding, none of
which are significant to the Company's results of operations or financial
condition, either individually or in the aggregate.  See further discussion of
such matters under the "Environmental Matters" caption of Item 1 of this Form
10-K.

11.  Pension Benefits

Substantially all of the Company's employees are covered by discretionary
contribution or defined benefit retirement plans.

Costs of the discretionary contribution pension plans are accrued in amounts
determined on the basis of percentages, generally established annually by the
Company, of employee compensation of the various units covered by such plans.
The contributions are funded as accrued.  Discretionary and defined contribution
plan expense for 1993, 1992 and 1991 was $5,164, $4,963 and $5,200,
respectively.

As of December 31, 1993, the Company's domestic defined benefit plans were
either in the process of being terminated (and their benefits frozen) or were
completely terminated.  The benefits are based on payment of a specific amount,
which varies by plan, for each year of service.  The Company's funding policy is
to contribute the minimum amount required either by law or union agreement.
Contributions are intended to provide not only for benefits attributed to
service through the plans' termination dates, but also for those expected to be
earned in the future.  Certain foreign subsidiaries sponsor unfunded defined
benefit plans which cover substantially all of their regular, full-time
employees.  Benefits are based on both years of service and compensation.
Defined benefit pension plan expense was $371, $291 and $462 for 1993, 1992 and
1991, respectively.  Accrued defined benefit pension liability recognized in the
consolidated balance sheet was $7,167 and $7,367 at December 31, 1993 and 1992.

12.  Retirement Health Care and Life Insurance Benefits

The Company provides limited health care and life insurance benefits for certain
retired employees.  These benefits are subject to deductible and copayment
provisions, medicare supplements and other limitations.  In 1990, the Company
adopted the provisions of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 106,
"Employers' Accounting for Postretirement Benefits Other Than Pensions," and
recorded a liability for the present value of the estimated future costs of
vested health care and life insurance benefits.  The new accounting method has
no impact on the Company's cash funding for retiree benefits.  At December 31,
1993 and 1992, the liability for postretirement health care and life insurance
benefits was $4,294 and $4,000, respectively, and was included in accrued
liabilities in the consolidated balance sheet.

Expense related to these benefits was $590, $546 and $506 in 1993, 1992 and
1991, respectively.

The Company leases 486 box cars under net long-term leases of 15 to 20 years to
WCTU Railway Company, an affiliated company.  Revenues from these leases are
classified in the preceding table as service revenues.

The Company from time to time advances funds in excess of its current cash
requirements for domestic operations to MIC or MIC's subsidiaries on an
unsecured demand basis.  Such advances, which bear interest principally at LIBOR
plus 1%, amounted to $202,393 and $284,030 at December 31, 1993 and 1992,
respectively.

Certain of the Company's Canadian operations and its affiliates enter into
intercompany loans utilizing their respective excess cash balances.  These
advances between the Company and subsidiaries of MIC amounting to a payable of
$138 and $977 at December 31, 1993 and 1992, respectively, have been included in
Advances to Parent Company.

Management fees are paid to The Marmon Group, Inc. ("Marmon"), an indirect
subsidiary of Holdings and an affiliate of MIC, for certain services provided by
Marmon's officers and employees including services with respect to accounting,
tax, finance, legal and related matters which Marmon provides to certain of
Holdings' divisions, subsidiaries and affiliates.  Marmon provides these
services to the Company because it is considered more cost efficient to provide
such services in this manner.

The management fee which Marmon charges to the Company and other entities that
it manages is determined in the following manner.  First, budgeted
administrative expenses of Marmon for the twelve month period following the date
of computation (including wages, salaries and related expenses, rent, utilities,
travel expenses and other similar expenses, but excluding extraordinary and non-
recurring items) are multiplied by the average of the following three
percentages (each of which is given equal weight):  (1) the percent of the sales
and services revenues of the Company to the total sales and services revenues of
all managed entities, including the Company; (2) the percent of the assets of
the Company to the assets of all managed entities, including the Company;
and (3) the percent of the net income of the Company to the net income of all
managed entities, including the Company.  In making this computation, Marmon
uses sales and services revenues and net income from the beginning of the year
to the approximate date of computation and assets at that date.

Marmon's management takes the amount derived from this formula and applies
discretion to determine the final management fee to be charged.  The factors
which are considered include matters such as the following:  any known operating
problems and risks that require or may require additional time to be devoted to
the Company by Marmon's management; significant expansion programs; significant
contracts; unusual tax or accounting matters; and the experience and length of
service of the Company's management.

Included in the preceding table as insurance billed are $159 in 1993, $879 in
1992 and $1,064 in 1991 for insurance premiums for coverage that was insured or
reinsured with an insurance company which the Company has been advised is
controlled by trusts for the benefit of an individual related by marriage to a
member of the Pritzker family.

In 1986, the Company entered into a partnership with an affiliate for the
purpose of purchasing used railcars.  The Company's investment as of December
31, 1993 and 1992 was $40,070 and $37,254, respectively, which represents 80%
ownership in this partnership.  The minority partner's interest in the
partnership at December 31, 1993 and 1992 is $10,018 and $9,314, respectively,
which is included in accrued liabilities.  The minority interest in income,
$704, $668 and $588 for the years ended December 31, 1993, 1992 and 1991,
respectively, is reflected in other income.

In the first quarter of 1993, the Company recorded an $80,000 credit to earnings
to reflect the adoption of SFAS 109.  In the third quarter, the Company recorded
a $7,300 charge to earnings to reflect the effect of the statutory tax rate
increase on deferred taxes.  See Note 9.

In the second quarter of 1992, included in net sales and service revenues and
cost of sales and services is $124,886 related to sale-leaseback transactions.
See Note 6.

In the fourth quarter of 1991, the Company recorded a $4,238 charge for the
writedown of the carrying value of box cars leased to an affiliated entity.

The substantial decrease in the fourth quarter of 1992 and 1991 earnings was
primarily attributed
to the Company's inability to benefit from certain foreign tax credits.

Net sales and service revenues in 1991 and 1992 have been restated above to
reflect the reclassification of certain lease revenues to conform with the 1993
presentation.

Railcars and fixed assets  are depreciated to estimated salvage value over 
their estimated useful lives on the straight line method.  For railcars, the
salvage value is the estimated scrap value of their steel content.  The
estimated useful lives are principally:  railcars, 20-30 years; buildings
and improvements 20-30 years; and machinery and equipment, 4-25 years.
