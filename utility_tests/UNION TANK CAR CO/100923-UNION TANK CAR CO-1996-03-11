ITEM 1.  BUSINESS

General

UNION TANK CAR COMPANY (with its wholly-owned subsidiaries herein collectively
referred to, unless the context otherwise requires, as the "Company") was
organized under the laws of Delaware on September 23, 1980 and is the successor
to a business which was originally incorporated in New Jersey in 1891.  The
Company is a wholly-owned subsidiary of Marmon Industrial Corporation, a wholly-
owned subsidiary of Marmon Holdings, Inc. ("Holdings").  Substantially all of
the stock of Holdings is owned, directly or indirectly, by trusts for the
benefit of certain members of the Pritzker family.  As used herein, "Pritzker
family" refers to the lineal descendants of Nicholas J. Pritzker, deceased.

Railcar Leasing, Services and Sales

The principal activity of the Company is the leasing of railway tank cars and
other railcars to United States, Canadian and Mexican manufacturers and other
shippers of chemical products, including liquid fertilizers, petroleum products,
including liquefied petroleum gas, food products and bulk plastics.  The Company
owns and operates one of the largest fleets of privately-owned railway tank cars
in the world.

As of December 31, 1995, the Company's fleet was comprised of 53,669 tank cars
and 13,943 railway cars of other types.  A total of 21,554 cars were added to
the lease fleet during the ten years ended December 31, 1995.  These cars
accounted for approximately 37% of total railcar lease revenues during 1995.
Most of the Company's cars were built by the Company or to its specifications
and the balance were purchased from other sources.

Management estimates that tank cars carrying chemicals and acids account for the
greatest portion of total leasing revenues, followed in order by compressed
gases (particularly liquefied petroleum gas and anhydrous ammonia), refined
petroleum products (such as gasoline, fuel oils and asphalt), food products and
liquid fertilizers.

A significant portion of the revenues from the Company's non-tank car fleet
derives from hopper cars carrying bulk plastics.  The remaining non-tank car
revenues are attributable to cars which serve the lumber, dry bulk chemical,
coal and sulphur industries.

The Company builds tank cars primarily for use in its leasing business.  In
addition, the Company builds cars for sale to others.  Generally, the Company
only manufactures a car following the receipt of a firm order for the lease or
sale of such car.

Substantially all of the Company's cars are leased directly to several hundred
manufacturers and other shippers under leases covering from one to several
thousand cars and for periods ranging from one to twenty years.  The average
term of leases entered into during 1995 for newly-manufactured cars was
approximately nine years.  The average term of leases entered into during 1995
for other cars was approximately four years.  Under the terms of most leases the
Company agrees to provide a full range of services, including car repair and
maintenance.  The Company supplies relatively few cars directly to railroads.

                                      -2-
<PAGE>
 
The Company markets its cars through regional sales offices located throughout
the United States and Canada and through a sales agent in Mexico.  To insure
optimum utilization of the U.S., Canadian and Mexican lease fleets, the Company
maintains fleet data processing systems which contain information relative to
each car, including its mechanical specifications, maintenance and repair data
and lease terms.

The Company has generally followed the practice of financing additions to its
fleet by borrowing 75% of the funds required through the issuance of equipment
obligations. The Company's long-term equipment obligations are generally payable
over a period of fifteen to twenty years, which is considerably less than the
estimated useful life of the equipment. In 1995, the Company entered into a 
sale-leaseback transaction pursuant to which it sold and leased back (under an
operating lease) an aggregate of approximately 2,057 railcars. In 1994, the
Company entered into two separate sale-leaseback transactions pursuant to which
it sold and leased back (under operating leases) an aggregate of approximately
2,197 railcars. The average term of the Company's leases (as lessor) is
substantially less than the average maturity of the equipment obligations and
the average terms of the operating leases (as lessee); however, the aggregate
rentals to be received in the future under existing leases are substantial.
Under the terms of the operating leases the Company assumes responsibility for
repairs and taxes.

The following table sets forth the minimum rentals to be received, the debt
maturities under outstanding equipment obligations, the minimum lease payments
due (as lessee) under all operating leases and the cost of the fleet. The table
excludes outstanding commercial paper, which, prior to the suspension of the
program effective May 23, 1994, was used as interim financing for additions to
the Company's railcar fleet.  The figures shown are the minimum future rentals
under leases in effect at the dates indicated.  Based upon its historical
experience, the Company expects that the cars (other than those which are
retired in the ordinary course of business) will be re-leased at the expiration
of such leases.  The rentals under such future leases and related interest and
other expenses to be incurred in the future cannot be ascertained and therefore
are not reflected in this table.

  (1)  Includes $143.0 million principal amount of unsecured senior notes issued
       by the Company in 1990, the proceeds of which were used to retire certain
       higher coupon railcar obligations.

Approximately 46% of the Company-owned fleet of railcars is pledged to secure
equipment obligations.  The remaining cars are free of liens.

The Company maintains repair facilities located at strategic points throughout
the United States and Canada.  In addition to the work performed by the Company,
certain maintenance and repair work is performed for the Company's account by
railroads when railroad inspection determines the need for such work under the
code of the Association of American Railroads ("AAR").

                                      -4-
<PAGE>
 
The Company is not a common carrier and is not subject to regulation or
supervision as such. The Company's railcars are subject to regulations governing
construction, safety and maintenance promulgated by the Department of
Transportation and various other government agencies and by the AAR. These
regulations have required and may in the future require the Company to make
significant modifications to certain of its cars from time to time.

The Company's facilities for manufacturing and assembling tank cars are located
in East Chicago, Indiana; Oakville, Ontario, Canada; and Sheldon, Texas.  The
Company also operates the largest network of shops in North America for
repairing and servicing railcars, as well as a fleet of specially equipped
trucks to perform repairs at customer plant sites. The principal shops are
located in Valdosta, Georgia; Muscatine, Iowa; El Dorado, Kansas; Ville Platte,
Louisiana; Marion, Ohio; Altoona, Pennsylvania; Cleveland, Longview and Sheldon,
Texas; Edmonton, Alberta; Sarnia and Oakville, Ontario; Montreal, Quebec; and
Regina, Saskatchewan.

See Note 21 to the consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of this
Form 10-K for information concerning the contemplated acquisition of Hawker
Canada Holdings, Inc.

Intersegment sales are immaterial.  Segment operating income includes segment
revenue less operating expenses directly traceable to the segment and an
allocation of common expenses benefiting more than one segment.

Major Customers

Revenues from any one customer did not exceed 5% of consolidated or industry
segment revenues.

Raw Materials

The Company purchases raw materials from a variety of suppliers, with no one
supplier in any industry segment being significant.  In the opinion of
management the Company will have adequate availability of applicable raw
materials in the future.

                                      -7-
<PAGE>
 
Foreign Operations

The Company does not believe that there are unusual risks attendant to its
foreign operations.

Competition

All the activities of the Company are in competition with similar activities
carried on by other companies. In particular, there are several companies
engaged in the business of leasing tank cars in the United States and Canada.
The largest competitor is General American Transportation Corporation (including
its Canadian affiliate, Canadian General Transit Company, Limited). The other
principal competitors in the leasing business are ACF Industries, Incorporated,
and General Electric Railcar Services Corporation. The principal competitive
factors are price, service and product design. The Company's integration of its
North American engineering, manufacturing, repair and leasing activities has
enhanced its ability to provide competitive products and services to its
customers.

Manufacturing Backlog

The Company builds tank cars primarily for use in its leasing business and the
number of cars added in any one year is a small percentage of the Company's
lease fleet. Additionally, for tank cars built for sale to customers, the
Company delivers against orders within a relatively brief period of time.
Therefore, backlog is not material to the Company's business or an understanding
thereof.

Employees

As of December 31, 1995, the Company had approximately 3,850 employees.

Environmental Matters

The Company believes that all of its facilities are in substantial compliance
with applicable laws and regulations relating to environmental protection. Over
the past several years the Company has attempted to identify and remediate
potential problem areas. In 1995 the Company spent approximately $4.5 million on
remediation and related matters, compared with $8.5 million and $4.7 million in
1994 and 1993, respectively. The Company expects to spend approximately $8.5
million in 1996 on similar activities, including approximately $6.6 million for
capital expenditures. Management believes that amounts accrued for remedial
activities and environmental liabilities (which in the aggregate are not
material) are adequate.

In October, 1990, the Pennsylvania Office of Attorney General and the
Pennsylvania Department of Environmental Resources ("DER") commenced an
investigation of alleged violations of the Pennsylvania Solid Waste Management
Act with respect to the handling of solid and hazardous waste material at the
Company's railcar repair facility in Altoona, Pennsylvania. The Board of
Directors of the Company authorized special counsel to conduct an internal
investigation of the allegations made against the Altoona facility. The Company
is satisfied with current operations at the facility.

                                      -8-

<PAGE>
 
At the request of the Pennsylvania DER, the Company has cooperated voluntarily
in a site assessment of areas of potential environmental contamination at the
facility. The Company has submitted its consultant's report to the Pennsylvania
DER for review. The Pennsylvania Attorney General's office and the Company's
counsel are engaged in discussions to resolve the criminal investigation. The
Company is unable to predict at this time whether satisfactory resolution of the
allegations will occur. If there is no satisfactory resolution of the
allegations, it is likely that the Pennsylvania authorities will initiate
criminal proceedings against the Company.

In June, 1993, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency ("EPA") filed an
administrative complaint alleging the Company violated Section 313 of the
Emergency Planning and Community Right-to-Know Act of 1986 by failing to submit
Toxic Chemical Release Inventory Reporting Forms relating to its use of certain
chemicals in manufacturing operations at its East Chicago, Indiana facility
during calendar years 1987-1990. The EPA proposed a civil penalty in the amount
of $524,000. The Company has denied the allegations of the complaint and has
requested a formal hearing to contest the EPA's allegations and the proposed
penalty. The Company is engaging in informal settlement negotiations with the
EPA.

In August, 1994, the U.S. Department of Justice filed a civil action against the
Company, pursuant to Sections 309(b) and (d) of the Clean Water Act, seeking
civil penalties not to exceed $25,000 for each day of violation. In December,
1995, this matter was settled by the Company's payment of a civil penalty of
$200,000.

The Company has been designated as a Potentially Responsible Party by the EPA at
three sites: Auto Ion Chemical Company, Kalamazoo, Michigan; Douglassville
Disposal Site, Union Township, Pennsylvania; and Whitehouse Waste Oil Pits Site,
Jacksonville, Florida. Costs incurred to date have not been material, either
individually or in the aggregate. Because of the level of the Company's
involvement at these sites, management of the Company believes that future costs
related to these sites will not be material, either individually or in the
aggregate.

Management of the Company does not anticipate that the resolution of any of the
matters discussed above will have a material adverse effect on the Company's
results of operations, financial condition or business.

ITEM 2.  PROPERTIES

In the opinion of management, the Company's properties are substantially
adequate and suitable for their intended use.

Railcars

The Company owns approximately 89 percent of its total lease fleet of 67,612
railcars, of which 53,669 are tank cars and 13,943 are other railway freight
cars. Of the approximately 60,427 owned cars, 32,833 are free of liens. Cars
which are not owned are leased from others under long-term net leases.

                                      -9-

Railcar Manufacturing and Assembling Facilities

The facilities for the manufacturing and assembling of railcars are located at
East Chicago, Indiana; Oakville, Ontario, Canada; and Sheldon, Texas, together
occupying approximately 170 acres.

Car Servicing and Repair Shops

The Company operates a network of shops for repairing and servicing railcars.
The principal shops owned by the Company are located at Valdosta, Georgia;
Muscatine, Iowa; El Dorado, Kansas; Ville Platte, Louisiana; Marion, Ohio;
Altoona, Pennsylvania; Cleveland, Longview, and Sheldon, Texas; Edmonton,
Alberta; Sarnia and Oakville, Ontario; Montreal, Quebec; and Regina,
Saskatchewan. Several other repair shops and small repair points are
strategically located throughout the United States and Canada.

Sulphur Processing

A subsidiary of the Company owns facilities in Canada and the Netherlands which
process liquefied sulphur into crystalline slates and granules and handle the
formed product.

Containment Vessel Head Manufacturing Facilities

A subsidiary of the Company owns a metal containment vessel head manufacturing
facility in Sheldon, Texas.

Liquefied Petroleum Gas Storage Facilities

A subsidiary of the Company owns several underground liquefied petroleum gas
storage caverns in Canada.

Other Properties

In connection with its other business activities, the Company owns (either
directly or through its subsidiaries) fastener manufacturing facilities in
Ashland, Ohio; Milton, Ontario; and Montreal, Quebec. In addition, subsidiaries
of the Company which manufacture fasteners lease several small plants in the
United States, Canada and Sweden. The Company and its subsidiaries maintain
numerous sales and business offices and warehouses, most of which are leased,
throughout the United States and Canada.

ITEM 3.  LEGAL PROCEEDINGS

The Company and its subsidiaries have been named as defendants in a number of
lawsuits and certain claims are pending. The Company has accrued what it
reasonably expects to pay to resolve such claims, including legal fees, and, in
the opinion of management, ultimate resolution of these matters will not have a
material effect on the Company's consolidated financial position or results of
operations. See discussion of Environmental Matters in Item 1 of this Form 10-K.

</TABLE>

The increases in 1995, 1994 and 1992 services and net sales are primarily the
result of sale-leaseback transactions of $130,517, $125,500 and $124,900,
respectively. The 1993 increase in net income includes an $80,000 credit to
earnings to reflect the adoption of SFAS 109.


ITEM 7.  MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION
          AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

1995 versus 1994

Results of Operations
- - ---------------------

Service revenues increased $53.3 million. Slightly more than half of the
increase resulted from expansion of the Company's sulphur service operations.
The remaining increase was primarily due to the effect of cars added to the
railcar lease fleet.  Gross profit increased approximately 6% from 1994.

Excluding the effects of sale-leaseback transactions, net sales revenues in 1995
increased $77.1 million, primarily due to increased railcar sales of $62.2
million.

Other income increased $3.6 million, primarily due to interest earned on an
increased average balance advanced to the Company's parent, as well as an
increase in the average interest rate.

Interest expense decreased $10.3 million primarily due to lower average balances
of debt outstanding and a lower average interest rate on debt outstanding.

                                      -11-
<PAGE>
 
Financial Condition
- - -------------------

Operating activities provided $211.3 million of cash in 1995.  These funds,
along with the proceeds from the sale-leaseback transaction, the issuance of
long-term debt, and the collection of funds advanced to parent, were used to
provide financing for railcar additions, service borrowed debt obligations and
pay dividends to the Company's stockholder.  It is the Company's policy to pay
to its stockholder a quarterly dividend equal to 70% of net income.  To the
extent that the Company generates cash in excess of its operating needs, such
funds are advanced to its parent and bear interest at commercial rates.
Conversely, when the Company requires additional funds to support its
operations, prior advances are repaid by its parent.  No restrictions exist
regarding the amount of dividends which may be paid or advances which may be
made by the Company to its parent.

In 1995, the Company spent $214.5 million for the construction and purchase of
railcars and other fixed assets.  The Company received $9.0 million in proceeds
from disposals of railcars and other fixed assets, net of $130.5 million in
proceeds from the sale-leaseback transaction.

In 1995, the Company issued $30.2 million in long-term equipment trust
certificates with an annual interest rate of 6.76% to finance additions to the
railcar lease fleet. Other financing activities of the Company included $114.6
million for principal repayments on borrowed debt and $59.0 million for
dividends.  Net cash used in financing activities was $143.4 million.

Management expects that the future cash to be provided by operating activities,
long-term railcar financings, and collection of funds previously advanced to
parent will be adequate to provide for the continued expansion of the Company's
business and enable it to meet its debt service obligations.

The Company has not experienced any significant impact of inflation and changing
prices on its financial position or results of operations over the last several
years.

The Company's Canadian subsidiaries enter into foreign currency forward
contracts to hedge against U. S. dollar exposures. Foreign currency forward
contracts, all with initial maturities of less than one year, amounted to $5.4
million and $12.6 million at December 31, 1995 and 1994, respectively.

Change in Accounting Principle
- - ------------------------------

The Financial Accounting Standards Board has issued SFAS No. 121, "Accounting
for the Impairment of Long-Lived Assets and for Long-Lived Assets to be Disposed
Of."  Adoption of the new standard in 1996 will not have a material impact on
the Company's financial position, results of operations or cash flow.

Other Matters
- - -------------

The Company has certain environmental matters currently outstanding, none of
which are significant to the Company's results of operations or financial
condition, either individually or in the aggregate. See further discussion of
such matters under the "Environmental Matters" caption of Item 1 of this
Form 10-K.

<PAGE>
 
1994 versus 1993

Results of Operations
- - ---------------------

Service revenues increased $12.1 million primarily due to the effect of cars
added to the railcar lease fleet offset by lower revenues from sulphur service
operations.  Gross profit was relatively unchanged from 1993.

In December, 1994, the Company entered into two separate sale-leaseback
transactions in which it sold $125.5 million of railcars.  Excluding these sale-
leaseback transactions, net sales revenues in 1994 increased $78.5 million
primarily due to increased railcar sales of $62.4 million and manufactured metal
containment vessel head sales of $11.3 million.

Other income decreased $1.1 million primarily due to lower earned income on
direct financing leases.

Interest expense decreased $5.1 million primarily due to a lower average
effective interest rate on debt outstanding, lower average balances of debt
outstanding, as well as the termination of the commercial paper program.

Financial Condition
- - -------------------

Operating activities provided $163.1 million of cash in 1994.  These funds,
along with proceeds from the issuance of borrowed debt, proceeds from sale-
leaseback transactions, and the collection of funds advanced to parent, were
used to provide financing for railcar additions, repay commercial paper
obligations, service long-term debt obligations and pay dividends to the
Company's stockholder.  It is the Company's policy to pay to its stockholder a
quarterly dividend equal to 70% of net income.  To the extent that the Company
generates cash in excess of its operating needs, such funds are advanced to its
parent and bear interest at commercial rates.  Conversely, when the Company
requires additional funds to support its operations, prior advances are repaid
by its parent.  No restrictions exist regarding the amount of dividends which
may be paid or advances which may be made by the Company to its parent.

In 1994, the Company spent $189.2 million for the construction and purchase of
railcars and other fixed assets.  The Company received $19.8 million in proceeds
from disposals of railcars and other fixed assets, net of the $125.5 million in
proceeds from the sale-leaseback transactions discussed previously.

In March, 1994, the Company issued $100.0 million in long-term equipment trust
certificates with an annual interest rate of 6.6% to finance additions to the
railcar lease fleet. Other financing activities of the Company included $52.4
million for the repayment of commercial paper obligations, $110.9 million for
principal repayments on debt and $44.0 million for dividends.  Net cash used in
financing activities was $107.3 million.

                         REPORT OF INDEPENDENT AUDITORS


TO UNION TANK CAR COMPANY

We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheet of Union Tank Car
Company and subsidiaries as of December 31, 1995 and 1994, and the related
consolidated statements of income, stockholder's equity and cash flows for each
of the three years in the period ended December 31, 1995.  These financial
statements are the responsibility of the Company's management.  Our
responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements based on
our audits.

We conducted our audits in accordance with generally accepted auditing
standards.  Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material
misstatement.  An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting
the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements.  An audit also includes
assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by
management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation.
We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.

In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present
fairly, in all material respects, the consolidated financial position of Union
Tank Car Company and subsidiaries at December 31, 1995 and 1994, and the
consolidated results of their operations and their cash flows for each of the
three years in the period ended December 31, 1995, in conformity with generally
accepted accounting principles.

As discussed in Note 9 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company
changed its method of accounting for income taxes in the year ended December 31,
1993.

1.  Ownership

UNION TANK CAR COMPANY (with its wholly-owned subsidiaries herein collectively
referred to, unless the context otherwise requires, as the "Company") is a
wholly-owned subsidiary of Marmon Industrial Corporation ("MIC") and a
subsidiary of Marmon Holdings, Inc. ("Holdings").  Substantially all of the
stock of Holdings is owned, directly or indirectly, by trusts for the benefit of
certain members of the Pritzker family.  As used herein, "Pritzker family"
refers to the lineal descendants of Nicholas J. Pritzker, deceased.

2.  Summary of Accounting Principles and Practices

    Principles of Consolidation

The accompanying consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the
Company and all subsidiaries.  All significant intercompany accounts and
transactions have been eliminated.

    Cash and Cash Equivalents

Cash and cash equivalents includes all highly liquid debt instruments purchased
with an original maturity of three months or less.

    Lessor Accounting

Operating Leases - Most of the Company's railcar leases are classified as
operating leases.  Aggregate rentals from operating leases are reported as
revenue ratably over the life of the lease.  Expenses, including depreciation
and maintenance, are charged against such revenues as incurred.

Direct Financing Leases - Some of the Company's railcar and other rental
equipment leases are classified as direct financing leases.  Gross investment in
leases (minimum lease payments plus estimated residual values) less the cost of
the equipment is designated as unearned income.  This unearned income is
recognized over the life of the lease based upon the "constant yield method" or
similar methods which generally result in an approximate level rate of return on
the investment.

    Depreciation and Fixed Assets Accounting

Railcars and fixed assets are recorded at cost less accumulated depreciation.
These assets are depreciated to salvage value over their estimated useful lives
on the straight-line method.  The estimated useful lives are principally:
railcars, 25-30 years; buildings and improvements, 20-30 years; and machinery
and equipment, 3-20 years.

                                      -20-
<PAGE>
  
                    UNION TANK CAR COMPANY AND SUBSIDIARIES
             NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)

The cost of major conversions and betterments are capitalized and depreciated
over their estimated useful life or, if shorter, the remaining useful life of
the related asset.  Maintenance and repairs are charged to expense when
incurred.  Gain or loss on disposals is included in other income, except for
those related to railcar disposals which are included in cost of services.

    Deferred Income Taxes

The Company provides deferred taxes for temporary differences between pre-tax
accounting income and taxable income (principally related to railcar
depreciation).

    Deferred Investment Tax Credits

United States investment tax credits (as generated through 1986 and to the
extent not transferred to lessees) and Canadian investment tax credits result in
a reduction of current or deferred income taxes and are due primarily to
investments in certain new railcars.  Investment tax credits retained are
deferred and amortized over the estimated useful lives of the related assets.

    Foreign Currency Translation

All assets and liabilities are translated at exchange rates in effect at the
date of translation.  Average exchange rates are used for revenues, costs and
expenses and income taxes.

Translation adjustments and transaction gains and losses are assumed by the
Company's parent.  For the years ended December 31, 1995, 1994 and 1993, MIC
absorbed gains of $934, $271 and $57, respectively.  Also in 1994, MIC assumed a
loss of $6,102 related to U. S. dollar denominated debt held by a Canadian
subsidiary of the Company.

    Inventories

Inventories are stated at the lower of cost (first-in, first-out) or market.

    Fair Value of Financial Instruments

All book value amounts for financial instruments approximate the instruments'
fair value except for the borrowed debt discussed in Note 8.

    Use of Estimates

The preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted
accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that
affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and accompanying notes.
Actual results could differ from those estimates.

    Reclassification

Certain prior year amounts have been reclassified to conform to the current
year's presentation.

3.  Railcar Lease Data

Railcars are leased directly to several hundred shippers, located throughout the
United States, Canada and Mexico.  The Company leases to a wide variety of
customers, and no customer accounted for more than 5% of consolidated lease
revenues.  The leases involve one to several thousand cars, normally for periods
ranging from one to twenty years.  The average term of leases entered into
during 1995 for newly-manufactured cars was approximately nine years.  The
average term of leases entered into during 1995 for other cars was approximately
four years.  Under the terms of most of the leases the Company agrees to provide
a full range of services including car repair and maintenance.

Minimum future rentals to be received on railcar leases at December 31, 1995,
are as follows:

Equipment obligations are secured by railcars with an original cost of
$1,351,084 and $1,641,909 at December 31, 1995 and 1994, respectively. The above
equipment obligations include $3,955 and $5,938 of capitalized leases at
December 31, 1995 and 1994, respectively.

The senior notes contain certain provisions regarding asset sales and sale-
leaseback restrictions.  As of December 31, 1995, the Company is in compliance
with all debt covenants.

In 1995, the Company issued $30,236 in long-term equipment trust certificates to
finance additions to its railcar fleet. The certificates bear interest at a rate
of 6.76% per annum. Interest is due semi-annually through January 2, 2006,
commencing in January, 1996. Principal will be due January 2, 2006.

The Company's Canadian subsidiaries have approximately $13,194 of credit lines
available on a no-charge basis.  No amounts were outstanding as of December 31,
1995 and 1994.

During the second quarter of 1994, the Company repaid all outstanding commercial
paper (through reductions in advances to parent) and suspended its commercial
paper program effective May 23, 1994.  On May 26, 1994, the Company terminated
the revolving credit agreement which had served as a liquidity back-up to the
commercial paper program.  Expenses associated with the credit agreement
(approximately $84 in 1994 and $370 in 1993) are included in interest expense.

Maturities of debt obligations for the years 1996 - 2000 are $477,639, as

The current fair value of the Company's borrowed debt is estimated by
discounting the future interest and principal cash flows at the Company's
estimated incremental borrowing rate at the respective year-end for debt with
similar maturities.  The Company currently anticipates holding all borrowed debt
obligations until maturity.

9.  Income Taxes

The Company is included in the consolidated U.S. federal income tax return of
Holdings.  Under an arrangement with MIC, federal income taxes, before
consideration of investment tax credits, are computed as if the Company files a
separate consolidated return.  For this computation, the Company generally uses
tax accounting methods which minimize the current tax liability (these methods
may differ from those used in the consolidated tax return).  Tax liabilities are
remitted to, and refunds are obtained from, MIC on this basis.  If deductions
and credits available to Holdings' entire consolidated group exceed those which
can be used on the return, allocation of the related benefits between the
Company and others will be at the sole discretion of Holdings.  As a member of a
consolidated federal income tax group, the Company is contingently liable for
the federal income taxes of the other members of the consolidated group.

Undistributed earnings of the Company's non-U.S. subsidiaries reflect full
provision for non-U.S. income taxes. However, since the earnings are
indefinitely reinvested in non-U.S. operations, no provision has been made for
taxes that might be payable upon remittance of such earnings nor is it
practicable to determine the amount of any such liability.

In 1995, 1994, and 1993 the Company paid foreign withholding taxes of $1,628,
$1,723, and $627, respectively.

Current U.S. income tax provisions were reduced, and deferred tax provisions
increased, by $5,907 in 1994 and $9,280 in 1993 due to utilization of U.S.
alternative minimum tax credits which had been provided for in 1990 and 1991.

The excess tax on foreign income represents differences due to higher foreign
tax rates and foreign tax credits not benefitted.

Effective January 1, 1993, the Company prospectively adopted the provisions of
Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 109, "Accounting for Income
Taxes," (SFAS 109) and changed from the deferred method to the asset and
liability approach to accounting for income taxes.  The cumulative effect of
this accounting change as of that date is reflected in the 1993 consolidated
statement of income as an $80,000 credit to earnings for the cumulative effect
of a change in accounting principle.

Deferred income taxes reflect the net tax effects of temporary differences
between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial reporting
purposes and the amounts used for income tax purposes.  The December 31, 1995
and 1994 net deferred income tax liabilities of $468,170 and $459,893 shown in
the accompanying consolidated balance sheet are composed of $504,065 and
$493,626 in deferred tax liabilities, partially offset by $35,895 and $33,733 in
deferred tax assets, respectively.  These deferred income tax assets and
(liabilities) result from the following temporary differences:

The above assets exclude certain state deferred income tax assets related to
loss carryforwards (which expire over the next thirteen years) in the gross
amount of $11,000.  These assets have been assigned a 100% valuation reserve due
to significant uncertainty as to ultimate realizability.   There have been no
changes in any asset valuation reserves for the year ended December 31, 1995.

10.  Contingencies

The Company and its subsidiaries have been named as defendants in a number of
lawsuits and certain claims are pending.  The Company has accrued what it
reasonably expects to pay to resolve such claims, and, in the opinion of
management, their ultimate resolution will not have a material effect on the
Company's consolidated financial position or results of operations.

The Company self-insures certain exposures in its risk management plan.  The
Company has accrued for the estimated costs of reported, as well as incurred but
not reported, self-insured claims.

The Company has certain environmental matters currently outstanding, none of
which are significant to the Company's results of operations or financial
condition, either individually or in the aggregate.  See further discussion of
such matters under the "Environmental Matters" caption of Item 1 of this 
Form 10-K.

11.  Pension Benefits

Substantially all of the Company's employees are covered by discretionary
contribution or defined benefit retirement plans.

Costs of the discretionary contribution pension plans are accrued in amounts
determined on the basis of percentages, generally established annually by the
Company, of employee compensation of the various units covered by such plans.
The contributions are funded as accrued.  Discretionary and defined contribution
plan expense for 1995, 1994 and 1993 was $6,202, $5,892 and $5,164,
respectively.

As of December 31, 1995, the Company's domestic defined benefit plans were
either in the process of being terminated (and their benefits frozen) or were
completely terminated.  The benefits are based on payment of a specific amount,
which varies by plan, for each year of service.  The Company's funding policy is
to contribute the minimum amount required either by law or union agreement.
Contributions are intended to provide not only for benefits attributed to
service through the plans' termination dates, but also for those expected to be
earned in the future.  Certain foreign subsidiaries sponsor unfunded defined
benefit plans which cover substantially all of their regular, full-time
employees.  Benefits are based on both years of service and compensation.
Defined benefit pension plan expense was $320, $357 and $371 for 1995, 1994 and
1993, respectively.  Accrued defined benefit pension liability recognized in the
consolidated balance sheet was $3,297 and $6,556 at December 31, 1995 and 1994,
respectively.

12.  Retirement Health Care and Life Insurance Benefits

The Company provides limited health care and life insurance benefits for certain
retired employees.  These benefits are subject to deductible and copayment
provisions, Medicare supplements and other limitations.  At December 31, 1995
and 1994, the liability for postretirement health care and life insurance
benefits was $3,739 and $4,298 respectively, and was included in accrued
liabilities in the consolidated balance sheet.

Expense related to these benefits was $326, $359 and $590 in 1995, 1994 and
1993, respectively.

             NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)

The Company from time to time advances funds in excess of its current cash
requirements for domestic operations to MIC or MIC's subsidiaries on an
unsecured demand basis.  Such advances, which bear interest principally at LIBOR
plus 1%, amounted to $164,521 and $180,057 at December 31, 1995 and 1994,
respectively.

Certain of the Company's Canadian operations and its affiliates enter into
intercompany loans utilizing their respective excess cash balances.  These
advances between the Company and subsidiaries of MIC resulted in a receivable of
$6,640 and $14,672 at December 31, 1995 and 1994, respectively, that are
included in Advances to Parent Company.

Management fees are paid to The Marmon Group, Inc. ("Marmon"), a subsidiary of
Holdings and an affiliate of MIC, for certain services provided by Marmon's
officers and employees including services with respect to accounting, tax,
finance, legal and related matters which Marmon provides to certain of Holdings'
divisions, subsidiaries and affiliates.  Marmon provides these services to the
Company because it is considered more cost efficient to provide such services in
this manner.

The management fee which Marmon charges to the Company and other entities that
it manages is determined in the following manner.  First, budgeted
administrative expenses of Marmon for the twelve month period following the date
of computation (including wages, salaries and related expenses, rent, utilities,
travel expenses and other similar expenses, but excluding extraordinary and non-
recurring items) are multiplied by the average of the following three
percentages (each of which is given equal weight):  (1) the percent of the sales
and services revenues of the Company to the total sales and services revenues of
all managed entities, including the Company; (2) the percent of the assets of
the Company to the assets of all managed entities, including the Company; and
(3) the percent of the net income of the Company to the net income of all
managed entities, including the Company. In making this computation, Marmon uses
sales and services revenues and net income from the beginning of the year to the
approximate date of computation and assets at that date.

Marmon's management takes the amount derived from this formula and applies
discretion to determine the final management fee to be charged.  The factors
which are considered include matters such as the following:  any known operating
problems and risks that require or may require additional time to be devoted to
the Company by Marmon's management; significant expansion programs; significant
contracts; unusual tax or accounting matters; and the experience and length of
service of the Company's management.

Included in the preceding table as insurance billed are $1,071 in 1995, $1,179
in 1994 and $159 in 1993 for insurance premiums for coverage that was insured or
reinsured with an insurance company which the Company has been advised is
controlled by trusts for the benefit of an individual related by marriage to a
member of the Pritzker family.

In 1986, the Company entered into a partnership with an affiliate for the
purpose of purchasing used railcars.  The Company's investment as of December
31, 1995 and 1994 was $46,814 and $43,229, respectively, which represents 80%
ownership in this partnership.  The minority partner's interest in the
partnership at December 31, 1995 and 1994 is $11,704 and $10,808, respectively,
which is included in accrued liabilities.  The minority interest in income,
$896, $790 and $704 for the years ended December 31, 1995, 1994 and 1993,
respectively, is reflected in other income.

21.  Subsequent Event

On February 19, 1996, Procor Limited ("Procor"), a wholly-owned subsidiary of
the Company, entered into an agreement with Hawker Siddeley Canada Inc. ("Hawker
Siddeley") and Hawker Canada Holdings Inc. ("Hawker Holdings"), a wholly-owned
subsidiary of Hawker Siddeley, whereby Procor agreed to make a takeover bid for
all of the outstanding shares of Hawker Holdings immediately following the
completion of a corporate reorganization by Hawker Siddeley pursuant to which
Hawker Siddeley will transfer its 55% ownership in CGTX Inc. to Hawker Holdings.
The aggregate cash price is Cdn. $120,000 ($87,960 at the December 31, 1995
exchange rate of .733).

On March 4, 1996, GATX Corporation and its subsidiaries, General American
Transportation Company ("GATC") and 314072 Canada Inc., initiated a lawsuit
against Hawker Siddeley, Hawker Holdings, Procor, Marmon Holdings, Inc., and
others, alleging the proposed corporate reorganization of Hawker Siddeley does
not comply with the terms of a shareholder's agreement between Hawker Siddeley
and GATC relating to their ownership in CGTX Inc.  While management believes its
agreement with Hawker Siddeley and Hawker Holdings should be allowed to proceed,
the Company is unable to predict at this time what the results of the lawsuit
will be.
