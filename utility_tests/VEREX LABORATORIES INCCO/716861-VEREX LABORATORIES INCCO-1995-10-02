                                PART I

ITEM 1.  BUSINESS

Background

     The Company was organized under the laws of the State of
Colorado on September 29, 1980.  The Company is in the business of
acquiring, developing and marketing pharmaceutical and health care
products.  The Company obtains formulae and patents when available,
selects trademarks, designs product packages and promotes and
markets, through licensing agreements, pharmaceutical and health
care products.  The Company has two subsidiaries, Bear
Laboratories, Inc., incorporated in April 1991 for the purpose of
exploiting VERIN  a drug formulation developed by the Company, and
The Colorado Nut Company, a distributor of snack items, acquired
during fiscal 1992.


     During its initial years, the Company was principally involved
in marketing and licensing efforts with respect to its first
constant release rate products, an aspirin tablet with the trade
name Verin  and an appetite control tablet with the trade name
Help .  Direct Company sales of these products were limited since
the Company had limited resources to promote these products. 
Efforts to obtain a licensing agreement with a substantial
marketing commitment were unsuccessful.

Going Concern Opinion

     The Company's auditors have issued a report on August 28, 1995
stating, in effect, that there is substantial doubt as to the
Company's ability to continue as a going concern.  See Financial
Statements.

Birklea, Ltd.

     On January 6, 1993, the Company entered into a Stock purchase
Agreement (Agreement) with Birklea, Ltd., 28 Hardcourt Street,
Dublin 2, Republic of Ireland whereby Company sold 660,000 shares
of its restricted common stock to Birklea, Ltd. for $550,000.  The
$550,000 was to be expended by the Company as agreed by Birklea,
Ltd. and the Company's President.  The newly issued shares
represented 37% of the Company's outstanding common stock after
issuance thereof.  Subsequent purchases of common stock have
increased Birklea, Ltd.'s holdings to 745,106 which represents
approximately 36% of the outstanding shares of Common Stock of the
Company.

     The Agreement provided that Birklea, Ltd. had the right to
designate one director on management's slate of directors at the
next annual meeting of shareholders.  Mark Banister of Westerham,

<PAGE>

Kent, England was designated by Birklea, Ltd. and at a meeting of
shareholders on May 4, 1993, was elected a director.

     The Agreement also provided that Birklea, Ltd. has an option
through September 1, 1994 to acquire for $2,400,000 such additional
shares of common stock of the Company at a price per share to be
determined as will permit Birklea, Ltd. to hold 60% of the issued
and outstanding common stock of the Company.  This option has been
extended on October 1, 1995 and may be extended beyond that date. 
Birklea, Ltd. had an additional option through September 1, 1995 to
purchase common stock of the Company at $30.00 per share in such
quantity as would permit in Birklea, Ltd. to acquire an additional
5% of the issued and outstanding common stock of the Company.  This
option has expired.

Credit Arrangements - Birklea, Ltd.

     Effective November 30, 1993, the Company entered into a Credit
Agreement with Birklea, Ltd., a major shareholder of the Company,
whereby Birklea, Ltd. agreed to use its best efforts to provide up
to $10,000,000 in financing to the Company.  Advances under the
arrangement bear interest at prime rate set by Morgan Guaranty
Bank, New York.  The convertible promissory note thereunder is
secured by the Company's right, title and interest in patent
applications, patents, tradenames, know-how and trade secrets
relating to existing and future drug formulations relating to the
drug commonly known as AZT.  At June 30, 1995, the balance on this
note was $1,667,000.  Principal is payable July 15, 1996.  Interest
is accruing at 9% per annum and was $215,000 at June 30, 1995.

     The convertible promissory note grants Birklea, Ltd. the
option to convert the balance due under such note to common stock
of the Company on the same terms that Birklea, Ltd. may purchase
common stock of the Company under the Stock Purchase Agreement of
January 6, 1993 between the Company and Birklea, Ltd.  See above.

Agreement With Burroughs Wellcome Co.

     On November 30, 1994 the Company entered into an agreement
with Burroughs Wellcome Co. (Wellcome) of Research Triangle Park,
N.C. whereby the Company, for a $1,200,000 payment, granted
Wellcome an option to obtain an exclusive worldwide license to a
controlled release rate formulation of zidovudine (AZT), developed
by the Company under the name AZTEC .  Under the agreement Wellcome
has the right to obtain all research and testing results on AZTEC 
From the Company and cooperation in connection with review of such
information.  In addition, Wellcome has the right of first refusal
to acquire a license to make, have made, use, sell and sublicense
AZTEC .

     AZTEC  has been studied in clinical trials at fifteen sites in
the United States involved in the treatment of persons diagnosed as

<PAGE>

having AIDS or being HIV positive.  The trials are coordinated and
directed by Alan S. Hollister, M.D. Ph.D. University of Colorado
Health Sciences Center.  The funds obtained from Wellcome have been
partially applied toward costs of these trials.

Licensing Activities

     The Company has licensing agreements with several foreign-based 
pharmaceutical companies covering the Company's patented
constant-release rate formulation of VEREXAMIL , as well as its
proprietary once daily delivery system for diltiazem, drugs used in
the treatment of heart disease and hypertension.  These agreements
provide the licensee the exclusive right to manufacture and market
the formulations in a certain geographical area for a specified
period of time subject to the licensee maintaining high quality of
material and workmanship for the product and require an initial
licensing fee payable to the Company and a royalty to the Company
based on product sales or other arrangements.

     The Company has not licensed its technology relating to other 
sustained release prescription drugs.  Licenses provide for the
Company to obtain health registration for the products as well as
manufacturing the finished dosage form.

     The following table summarizes licensing agreements in
existence at June 30, 1995:

Licensee and
Year of License               Territory           Drug

Sanofi GmbH                   W. Germany          Verapamil

Productos BiotyLDA            Portugal            Verapamil
(1988)

     Royalties on the foregoing licensing agreements range from 5%
to 7.5% of invoice sales and there is no minimum sales requirements
pursuant to the agreements.  Revenues from initial licensing fees
for the fiscal years ended June 30, 1995, 1994 and 1993 were $-0-,
$-0- and $20,000, respectively.
  
     The Company intends to continue to pursue licensing
arrangements with respect to marketing and/or developing its drug
formulations and compounds.  No such arrangements were entered into
during fiscal 1995, primarily due to research and clinical trials
on AZTEC .

AZT Formulation

     The Company has developed a unique controlled release rate
formulation of zidovudine (AZT), the primary drug used in the
treatment of persons diagnosed as having Acquired Immunodeficiency
Syndrome (AIDS) or being HIV positive.  The trademark name AZTEC 
has been registered with the United States Patent and Trademark
Offices and a patent has been filed with authorities in the U.S.
and Europe.  The Company's formulation has been the subject of a
clinical study at the University of Colorado Health Science Center
which concluded that the AZTEC  formulation had fewer adverse side
effects, produces longer duration blood level curves, and higher
intercellular phosphorated AZT levels than the currently used AZT
drug (Retrovir ).  Further, AZTEC  is administered twice daily
compared to 5-6 a day dosages of Retrovir .  During the fiscal year
ended June 30, 1995 clinical trials of AZTEC  were conducted at
fifteen sites in the United States at a cost of approximately
$635,000.  The Company has been dependent upon Birklea, Ltd. and
Wellcome (see Agreement With Burroughs Wellcome Co. above) for
funding for such trials.  These trials are not completed and it is
expected that an additional $200,000 to $300,000 will be required
to complete them.  The Company is currently attempting to locate
funding to complete the trials and there is no assurance that such
can be located.  It is estimated that the trials are 90% complete.

Nanospheres

     The Company has developed (patent pending) a drug delivery
system that will enable oral administration of many drugs of
macromolecule size, particularly proteins, polypeptides and
polysaccharides, which have low or no bioavailability when given
orally.  This technology involves the use of nanospheres which are
loaded with active drug.  These nanospheres are biodegraded over
several days in the body and the active drug is released slowly. 
So far, Verex researchers have been successful in developing
heparin nanospheres that, when given to animals as a single dose,
produced therapeutic levels for seven days.  An article has been
published on this process, and patents and trademarks have been
filed.

Amantex 

     This is an antiviral compound, delivered in a controlled
release formulation, for the treatment of recurrent herpetic
lesions.  The Company has received a trademark for this product.

Veraderm 

     Veraderm is a wound dressing, made from a proprietary
formulation of polymers that, when applied superficially to an open
wound, can enhance healing while diminishing the chances of
infection.  Early testing has shown it to be particularly
beneficial in the treatment of decubitus ulcers.  A trademark has
been received.

Psorex 

     The Company has discovered a treatment for psoriasis which it
believes is safe and effective with no side effects.  Psoriasis is
a chronic inflammatory skin disease, characterized by skin scaling
and ulcerations, which affects about 2% of the population.  The
formulation is a tablet, Psorex , which contains safe ingredients
and which the Company hopes to market over-the-counter after
independent studies are completed and in compliance with FDA
labeling requirements.  The Company's preliminary studies indicate
that about 85% of patients show marked improvement when taking one
to three tablets daily at bed time.  The Company has applied for a
trademark for Psorex  and is preparing a patent application.

Government Regulation

     Non-prescription drug products are regulated by various
federal, state, municipal and foreign regulatory agencies with
respect to safety, effectiveness, advertising and labeling.  The
principal regulatory agency in the United States is the Food and
Drug Administration (FDA) which requires evidence of safety and
efficacy of a drug formulation before it can be marketed.

<PAGE>

     Non-prescription or over-the-counter (OTC) drugs are
generally recognized by the FDA as safe and effective if they meet
certain conditions set forth in FDA regulations.  These regulations
relate to such items as ingredient quantity and quality,
manufacturing practices, side effects, labeling, container
components, dosage instructions and warnings for misuse. 
Independent advisory panels of qualified experts are appointed
under FDA regulations to review the safety and efficacy of certain
OTC drugs.

     The Company has applied its constant release technologies to
certain drugs that are prescription items, including verapamil,
diltiazem, pseudoephedrine, erythromycin, quinidine, hydralazine,
propranolol and indomethacin.  Approval of the FDA is required
before the Company or its licensees may market any of the foregoing
formulations in the U.S.  FDA regulations can substantially affect
the cost and time involved in obtaining and maintaining approval to
market new drugs and existing drugs with new delivery systems.  The
FDA requires scientific evidence of safety and efficacy before new
drugs can be marketed.

     The Company's licensing agreements with foreign manufacturers
provided that the licenses of these respective drugs comply with
applicable foreign regulations prior to marketing such drugs.

Patents and Trademarks

     The Company has developed proprietary technologies which
relate to the development of its drug formulations and business. 
These technologies relate primarily to the constant release
characteristics of such formulations.  The Company holds several
patents and has filed other patent applications relating to these
technologies.

     The Company has obtained several U.S. Trademarks, including
one for its name and others for capsules and formulations which
have been utilized in products and formulations relating to
constant release rate delivery systems.

Competition and Markets

     The Company's drug formulations face severe competition from
many companies which have far greater financial and technical
resources as well as an established reputation.

     The Company has sought licensing arrangement for its
formulations rather than engage in significant marketing efforts of
its own.  Its limited retail marketing efforts have been undertaken
primarily to enhance product licensing opportunities.

The Colorado Nut Company, Inc.

     On October 3, 1991 the Company acquired all of the issued and
outstanding common stock of The Colorado Nut Company, Inc. (name
changed from Half Crack Nut Company), a Colorado corporation, for
$24,000 from two non-affiliated individuals who owned such stock. 
This company distributed snack items to retail establishments in
the Denver metro area prior to  the acquisition and continued such
distribution and mail order snack sales thereafter.  For the year
ended June 30, 1995 total sales for this wholly owned subsidiary
were $347,429 for a net loss of $(55,645).

     The snack sales industry is marked by substantial competition
from many large, well capitalized entities with large advertising
budgets.  The Company does not expect to compete head-to-head with
such entities but will attempt to find a niche in which to operate,
such as the mail order, holiday or gift market.

Employees

     The Company has three full-time employees, one of whom is an
officer and one of whom is a director.  Further, four persons work
for the Company's subsidiary, The Colorado Nut Company.

ITEM 2.  PROPERTIES

     The Company leases office and research facilities at 14
Inverness Drive East, Building D, Suite 100, Englewood, Colorado,
consisting of 6,789 square feet of space at $4,610 per month
pursuant to a two-year lease through March 31, 1997.  The Company
sublets a portion of the premises at $1,900 per month to an officer
of the Company of which $15,200 remained unpaid at June 30, 1995. 
For its snack distribution business, the Company leases
approximately 4,864 square feet for processing at 730 S. Jason
Street, Denver, Colorado pursuant to a five-year lease at $1,611.75
per month through July 31, 1998.

ITEM 3.  LEGAL PROCEEDINGS

     No legal proceedings are pending.

ITEM 4.  SUBMISSION OF MATTERS TO A VOTE OF SECURITY HOLDERS

     No matters were submitted to the Company's shareholders for a
vote during the Company's fiscal fourth quarter.

ITEM 7.  MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL
         CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

Results of Operations

     1995 Compared to 1994

     Revenues were up 89% from fiscal 1994 primarily due to the
revenues generated from the Wellcome Agreement on AZTEC .  Sales at
the Company's snack food subsidiary were down 56%.

     Costs and expenses increased for fiscal 1995 $146,121 due
primarily to the costs experienced relating to the clinical trials
on the Company's AZTEC  formulation.  See "BUSINESS - AZT
Formulation."  These costs are included in research and development
which expense is approximately $178,000 higher for 1995.  This item
contributes the most to the Company's operating loss for 1995. 
AZTEC  generates no revenues for the Company since it is still in
the clinical trial stage.  There is no assurance this formulation
will become a revenue generating product.

     The Company's pharmaceutical segment accounts for 96% of the
Company's $1,281,345 loss for 1995.  This percentage is comparative
to the 1994 loss percentage for this segment on $1,872,285 in total
losses.  Because of the relatively high costs of clinical trials
and related activities for new prescription drug formulations such
as for AZT and the lack of corresponding revenues pending action on
regulatory application, it can be expected that significant losses
for this segment will continue until there is corresponding revenue
from these new potential products, of which there is no assurance.

     1994 as Compared to 1993

     Revenues were down 8% from fiscal 1993 primarily due to lower
sales at the Company's snack food subsidiary.  During the year this
subsidiary moved its packaging and sales facility from Wheat Ridge
to Denver, which in part may have affected sales.  The Company's
contract and other income of $211,192 increased substantially
compared to 1993 when the Company only had $921 from these sources.

     Costs and expenses increased for fiscal 1994 $907,400 due
primarily to the costs experienced relating to the clinical trials
on the Company's AZTEC  formulation.  See "BUSINESS - AZT
Formulation."  These costs are included in research and development
which expense is nearly $1,000,000 higher for 1994.  This item
contributes the most to the Company's operating loss for 1994. 
AZTEC  generates no revenues for the Company since it is still in
the clinical trial stage.  There is no assurance this formulation
will become a revenue generating product.

     The Company's pharmaceutical segment accounts for 96% of the
Company's $1,872,285 loss for 1994.  This percentage is comparative

<PAGE>

to the 1993 loss percentage for this segment on $888,971 in total
losses.  Because of the relatively high costs of clinical trials
and related activities for new prescription drug formulations such
as for AZT and the lack of corresponding revenues pending
regulatory application and action if the clinical trials are 
positive, it can be expected that significant losses for this
segment will continue until there is corresponding revenue from
these new potential products, of which there is no assurance.

     1993 as Compared to 1992

     Revenues for 1993 nearly doubled over 1992, however cost of
sales and general and administrative expenses increased by 85% and
35%, respectively for the period.  In addition, research and
development expense increased nearly threefold from $66,676 to
$180,947 relating primarily to development costs for the AZTEC 
formulation.  As a result, losses increased by $235,455 or 36% over
1992 losses.  Since AZTEC  is still in its development stage, this
formulation generated no revenues and there is no assurance that it
will do so in the future.

     As indicated in Note 7 to the financial statements relating to
segment information, approximately 93% of the Company's $888,971 in
losses are attributable to the Company's pharmaceutical segment
which generated only $20,190 in sales.  Whereas, the Company's
snack sales division accounted for nearly all revenues and only 7%
of the losses.  Until such time as the Company obtains significant
revenues from drug formulation, of which there is no assurance, it
is expected that expenses related to development, testing and
regulatory applications will be funded from equity and/or debt
financing.  The availability of such funding is not assured.

Liquidity and Capital Resources

     At August 28, 1995 the Company's auditors express concern as
to the ability of the Company to continue in light of losses and
net capital deficiency.  See Financial Statements.

     At June 30, 1995 the Company had a working capital deficiency
of $2,037,850 compared to negative working capital of $1,114,977 at
June 30, 1994.  The principal item contributing to the differences
is the loss of $1,281,345, accrued salary and benefits to the
Company's president of $446,287 and accrued interest of $215,765.

     The Company has no capital commitments other than salaries of
the president and six other employees and the payment of rent on
its facilities lease and snack processing facility.  Such
commitments are not satisfiable from current revenues.  Further,
the Company has very limited cash resources to operate the Company
at its current level of expense through December 31, 1995 without
liquidity problems.  In the past the Company has been dependent for
funding on Birklea, Ltd. which holds options to purchase common

<PAGE>

stock.  More recently it has been able to fund its research,
clinical trials and administrative costs from funds obtained from
Wellcome and the sale of newly issued common stock.  There is no
assurance that additional funding will be forthcoming.

     During the year ended June 30, 1995 the Company also made
sales of 61,750 shares of common stock to foreign purchasers
pursuant to Regulation S under the Securities Act of 1995 raising
approximately $346,008 in total.  Subsequent to fiscal year-end and
additional 65,417 shares of common stock were sold for $392,502. 
The Company may continue to raise capital to fund operations
through this means in fiscal 1996.

Industry Trends

     There is substantial competition with respect to delayed
release drug delivery products from major, highly recognized,
manufacturers with large advertising budgets.  In addition, major
drug manufacturers currently market recognized prescription
formulations for verapamil, naproxen, indomethacin and AZT.

ITEM 13.  CERTAIN RELATIONSHIPS AND RELATED TRANSACTIONS
 
     The Company leases facilities at a monthly rate of $4,241 plus
a pro rata share of maintenance costs.  A portion of the space is
subleased to Jerry R. Dunn, an officer of the Company at $1,900 per
month of which $15,200 remained unpaid at June 30, 1995. 
Management believes the terms of the foregoing facilities sharing
are as fair to the Company as could be arranged with an independent
party.

     Jerry R. Dunn, a non-salaried officer and director of the
Company, from time to time provides legal services to the Company. 
For the year ended June 30, 1995 the Company paid a total of
$22,763 in fees for legal services to Jerry R. Dunn.  Management
believes the terms on which these services are performed and
charged are as fair to the Company as could be obtained from an
independent lawyer.

                    INDEPENDENT AUDITORS' REPORT



To the Board of Directors and Stockholders
Verex Laboratories, Inc. and Subsidiaries
Denver, Colorado

We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Verex
Laboratories, Inc. and Subsidiaries as of June 30, 1995 and 1994  and
the  related  consolidated  statements of  operations,  stockholders'
deficit  and  cash flows for each of the three years  in  the  period
ended June 30, 1995.  These consolidated financial statements are the
responsibility of the Company's management.  Our responsibility is to
express  an opinion on these consolidated financial statements  based
on our audits.

We  conducted  our  audits  in  accordance  with  generally  accepted
auditing standards.  Those standards require that we plan and perform
the  audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial
statements  are  free of material misstatement.   An  audit  includes
examining,  on  a  test basis, evidence supporting  the  amounts  and
disclosures in the consolidated financial statements.  An audit  also
includes  assessing  the accounting principles used  and  significant
estimates  made  by  management, as well as  evaluating  the  overall
financial statement presentation.  We believe that our audits provide
a reasonable basis for our opinion.

In  our  opinion, the consolidated financial statements  referred  to
above  present  fairly,  in  all  material  respects,  the  financial
position  of  Verex Laboratories, Inc. and Subsidiaries at  June  30,
1995  and  1994, and the results of their operations and  their  cash
flows  for each of the three years in the period ended June 30, 1995,
in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles.

The accompanying consolidated financial statements have been prepared
assuming  that  Verex Laboratories and Subsidiary (the Company)  will
continue  as  a  going  concern.  As  discussed  in  Note  1  to  the
consolidated financial statements, the Company has suffered recurring
losses  from operations and has a net capital deficiency  that  raise
substantial doubt about the entity's ability to continue as  a  going
concern.   Management's  plans in regard to these  matters  are  also
described  in Note 1.  The consolidated financial statements  do  not
include any adjustments that might result from this uncertainty.

Note 1 - Summary of Significant Accounting Policies

Verex Laboratories, Inc. (the "Company") was incorporated in Colorado
on  September  29,  1980 and began developmental activities  in  July
1981.   The  Company  was  primarily  engaged  in  the  business   of
developing  and  marketing  non-prescription  and  prescription  drug
products utilizing constant release rate drug delivery systems.   The
Company  had limited sales and marketing operations until October  3,
1991,  when it acquired 100% of the outstanding stock of the Colorado
Nut Company, Inc.  The Colorado Nut Company assembles and sells snack
food  items.   Bear Laboratories, Inc., a wholly-owned subsidiary  of
the  Company,  was incorporated and began operations in  April  1991.
Bear  Laboratories, Inc. was formed to market one  of  the  Company's
products through a national advertising campaign.

Going Concern

The  Company  and its subsidiaries incurred a loss of $1,281,345  for
the  year  ended  June  30, 1995 and continues to  experience  a  net
capital  deficiency.  The Company has entered into a credit agreement
with a Stockholder where the Stockholder will advance the Company  up
to   $10,000,000  at  the  Stockholder's  discretion.   There  is  no
assurance these plans will be sufficient to sustain operations.

Principles of Consolidation

The  consolidated financial statements include the  accounts  of  its
wholly-owned  subsidiaries Bear Laboratories, Inc. and  the  Colorado
Nut  Company.  All intercompany accounts and transactions  have  been
eliminated in consolidation.

Inventory

Inventory  consists of snack food products and are  recorded  at  the
lower of cost or market on a first-in, first-out basis (FIFO) basis.

Patented Drug Products

Patented drug products include costs incurred to produce products  to
be  used  in clinical tests and are carried at the lower of  cost  or
market on a specific identification basis.

Property and Equipment

Property and equipment is depreciated over the estimated useful lives
(three to seven years) of the asset using various methods.  Leasehold
improvements are amortized on a straight-line basis over  the  remain
ing term of the office lease.

Goodwill, Patents and Trademarks

Goodwill, patents and trademarks are stated at cost and are amortized
on a straight-line basis over a period of ten years.

<PAGE>

Note 1 - Summary of Significant Accounting Policies (continued)

License Income

The  Company  has  entered  into licensing  agreements  with  several
pharmaceutical companies to manufacture and exclusively market two of
the  Company's  patented drug products, a constant-release  rate  for
mulation of Verapamil and Aztec products in an established geographic
area..   The  agreements generally require an initial  non-refundable
licensing  fee to be paid to the Company and future royalty  payments
based  on  subsequent product sales.  Licensing income is  recognized
when earned.

Research and Development Costs

The  Company expenses all research and product development  costs  as
incurred.

Cash Equivalents

The  Company  considers investments that are purchased  within  three
months  of  their  date  of maturity to be  cash  equivalents.   Cash
equivalents  consist of certificates of deposit.  At June  30,  1995,
the  Company had approximately $60,000 in excess of federally insured
amounts.

Income Taxes

Deferred  tax  liabilities and assets are  determined  based  on  the
difference between the financial statements and tax basis  of  assets
and liabilities using the enacted tax rates in effect for the year in
which  the  differences are expected to occur.   The  measurement  of
deferred  tax assets is reduced, if necessary, by the amount  of  any
tax  benefits that, based on available evidence, are not expected  to
be realized.

Reclassification

Certain  amounts in the 1994 and 1993 financial statements have  been
reclassified to conform with the 1995 presentation.


Note 2 - Common Stock

Reverse Stock Split

In 1993, the Company effected a one-for-ten reverse stock split.  All
references  to  the  number of common shares  and  per  common  share
amounts have been restated to reflect the split.

<PAGE>


Note 2 - Common Stock (continued)

Stock Purchase Agreement

On  January  6,  1993,  the Company entered  into  a  Stock  Purchase
Agreement (Agreement) with Birklea, Ltd., whereby the Company  sold
660,000  shares of its restricted common stock to Birklea,  Ltd.  for
$550,000.   The newly issued shares represented 37% of the  Company's
outstanding   common   stock  after  issuance  thereof.    Subsequent
purchases of common stock have increased Birklea, Ltd.'s holdings  to
745,106  shares which represents approximately 40% of the outstanding
shares of Common Stock of the Company.

The  Agreement also provided that Birklea, Ltd. has an option through
October  1, 1995 to acquire for $2,400,000 such additional shares  of
restricted  common stock of the Company at a price per  share  to  be
determined as will permit Birklea, Ltd. to hold 60% of the issued and
outstanding  common  stock  of the Company.   Birklea,  Ltd.  had  an
additional option through September 1, 1995 to purchase common  stock
of  the  Company at $30 per share in such quantity as will permit  in
Birklea,  Ltd.  to  acquire  an  additional  5%  of  the  issued  and
outstanding common stock of the Company.  This option has expired.

Stock Options

The President of the Company has the right through October 1, 1995 to
acquire such number of shares of common stock of the Company at  $.80
per  share to permit him to hold 25% of the outstanding common  stock
of the Company.

Net Loss Per Common Share

Net  loss  per common share for the years ended June 30, 1995,  1994,
and  1993  has  been  computed on the basis of the  weighted  average
number  of  common  shares outstanding of 1,949,122,  1,890,847,  and
1,471,780.


Note 3 - Income Taxes

The  Company has long-term deferred tax assets as a result of its net
operating losses and deferred salary (assumed a tax rate of 34%) that
is  fully  impaired  due  to  uncertainty as  to  their  utilization.
Accordingly,  there  is no net deferred tax asset  reflected  in  the
accompanying financial statements.

Note 4 - Related Party Transactions

Employment and Royalty Agreements

On  November  30,  1993,  the  Company  entered  into  a  new  8-year
employment contract with its President.  The contract may be extended
by  the President.  Under the terms of the contract, the President re
ceives an annual base salary of $338,000 and an annual cost of living
adjustment plus 8%.

The  contract  also  provides  for  certain  insurance  and  employee
benefits and entitles the President to participate in retirement  and
management incentive plans that the Company is required to establish.
Such  plans have not yet been established.  As of June 30,  1995  and
1994,  the  Company  owes  approximately $1,616,000  and  $1,269,000,
respectively,  of vacation pay and salary increases to its  President
under terms of the employment contract.

In  addition,  the President receives certain royalties  on  the  net
sales  from  the Company's products, and minimum annual royalties  of
$10,000  per product through November 30, 1994 and $1,000 thereafter.
Such royalties amounted to $3,000, $14,000, and $20,000 for the years
ended June 30, 1995, 1994 and 1993.  The amount owed to the President
for  such royalties was approximately $197,000, and $194,000 at  June
30,  1995  and  1994, respectively.  In return for this compensation,
the  President is obligated to assign all title and ownership of  his
inventions, formulations and products to the Company.

<PAGE>

Note 4 - Related Party Transactions (continued)

Employment and Royalty Agreements (continued)

In  the  event that the Company terminates the President's employment
prior  to  expiration of the contract, the Company  is  obligated  to
provide  the President the specified annual salary for the  remaining
term  of  the  agreement, and pay certain insurance  benefits  for  a
period  of three years.  The President would continue to be  entitled
to royalties on net sales of the Company's products.

The  Company  entered into an agreement with its President  deferring
payment of vacation pay, salary increases and royalties accrued as of
June  30, 1995 until January 1, 1997.  As of June 30, 1995 and  1994,
