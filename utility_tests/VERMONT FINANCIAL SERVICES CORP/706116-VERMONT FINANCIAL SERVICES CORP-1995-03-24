                                        PART I
            
     Item 1 - Business
            
             Vermont Financial Services Corp. (VFSC), a Delaware                
     corporation organized in 1990, is a registered bank holding company      
     under the Bank Holding Company Act of 1956, as amended, and its main      
     office is located in Brattleboro, Vermont.  Assets of VFSC were           
     $1,205 million at December 31, 1994.  VFSC owns 100 percent of the         
     stock of Vermont National Bank (VNB) and United Bank (UB).  VFSC has      
     no other active subsidiaries and engages in no activities other than      
     holding the stock of VNB and UB (the Banks).
            
       Vermont National Bank
             VNB, a national banking association, is the successor to the       
     original Bank of Brattleborough, which was chartered in 1821.  VNB         
     is the second largest bank in the State of Vermont with total              
     deposits of $814 million and total assets of $977 million at              
     December 31, 1994.  VNB conducts business through 31 offices located      
     in seven of Vermont's 14 counties, including the cities of                
     Brattleboro, Burlington, Rutland and Montpelier.  The offices of VNB      
     are in good physical condition with modern equipment and facilities      
     adequate to meeting the banking needs of customers in the                
     communities served.
            
             VNB offers a wide range of personal and commercial banking         
     services, including the acceptance of demand, savings, and time           
     deposits; making and servicing secured and unsecured loans; issuing      
     letters of credit; and offering fee based services.  In addition,         
     VNB offers a wide range of trust and trust related services,              
     including services as executor, trustee, administrator, custodian         
     and guardian. VNB lending services include making real estate,           
     commercial, industrial, agricultural and consumer loans.  VNB also         
     offers data processing services consisting primarily of payroll and    
     automated clearing house for several outside clients.  VNB provides      
     financial and investment counseling to municipalities and school           
     districts within its service area and also provides central                
     depository, lending payroll and other banking services for such           
     customers.  VNB also provides safe deposit facilities, Master Card         
     and Visa credit card services.  Over ninety percent of VNB's loans         
     are made to individuals and business which are located in or have         
     properties in Vermont.  VNB owns and operates 28 automated teller         
     machines (ATMs) at its branch locations and 6 ATMs in other                
     locations.  In addition, VNB is a member of the Plus, Yankee 24,           
     NYSE, and VISA networks and has access to the Honor, Cirrus,              
     Discover, American Express and Master Card networks. 
     
             According to the State Department of Banking,  Insurance and       
     Securities, as of December 31, 1993, 5 state-chartered savings           
     banks, 12 state-chartered commercial banks and 9 national banks are      
     located and do business in the State of Vermont, the area in which         
     VNB conducts its business.  As of such date, VNB had 12.4%, 12.6%         
     and 12.5% of the total assets, loans and deposits, respectively, of      
     these 26 banking institutions.
            
     United Bank
             UB is a Massachusetts chartered stock savings bank originally  
     incorporated in 1855 as the Shelburne Falls Five Cent Savings Bank,
     which   subsequently changed its name to the Shelburne Falls Savings
     Bank.  In  1975, the Shelburne Falls Savings Bank merged with the
     Conway Savings  Bank under the name of United Savings Bank (USB).  In
     1978, USB merged  with the Haydenville Savings Bank.  USB centralized
     its operations in Greenfield in 1981.  In April, 1988, USB purchased
     the deposits, real   estate, furniture and equipment of four (4)
     branch offices of First National Bank of Boston located in Shelburne
     Falls, Greenfield (2) and South Deerfield, all in Franklin County,
     Massachusetts.  The deposits of these four offices totalled $40.4
     million. In 1995 United Savings Bank changed its name to United Bank. 
     UB maintains full service banking   offices in Greenfield (2), Conway,
     Haydenville, Shelburne Falls and  South Deerfield.  UB's market area
     is centered in Franklin County which abuts the southern borders of
     both Vermont and New Hampshire.  At December 31, 1994 UB had total
     assets of $226 million, total loans of $199 million and total deposits
     of $200 million.
            
             UB is primarily engaged in the business of attracting deposits
     from the general public and originating loans secured by first liens
     on residential real estate.  UB also makes mortgage loans on
     commercial real estate and originates consumer loans, most of which
     are collateralized.  UB maintains a portion of its assets in federal
     government and agency obligations, various types of corporate
     securities and other authorized investments.  UB provides traditional
     deposit services as well as money market deposit instruments, demand
     deposits and NOW accounts.  UB has installed a proprietary system of
     "Money Mover24" ATMs in all its branch offices; the ATMs are part of
     the Cirrus system, which operates nationally, and the Yankee 24
     network with members throughout New England in over 2,000 locations.
            
             UB has a wholly-owned subsidiary, Hayburne, Inc., which is  
     incorporated in the Commonwealth of Massachusetts.  Hayburne, Inc.,
     owns the "Hayburne Building", a 26,000 square foot office building
     located at 55 Federal Street, Greenfield, Massachusetts, in which
     office space is leased to various tenants.
            
             The Banks compete on the local and the regional levels with
     other commercial banks and financial institutions for all types of
     deposits, loans and trust accounts.  Competitors include metropolitan
     banks and financial institutions based in southern New England and New
     York City, many of which have greater financial resources.
            
             In the retail market for financial services, competitors
     include other banks, credit unions, finance companies, thrift
     institutions and, increasingly, brokerage firms, insurance companies,
     and mortgage loan companies.
            
             In the personal and commercial trust business, competitors
     include mutual funds, insurance companies and investment advisory
     firms.
            
             VFSC and its subsidiaries, on December 31, 1994, employed  
     approximately 622 persons.  They enjoy good relations with their  
     employees.  A variety of employee benefits are available to officers
     and employees, including health, group life and disability income
     replacement insurance, a funded, non-contributory pension plan and an
     incentive savings and profit sharing plan.
            
             Impact of Inflation.  The Consolidated Financial Statements
     and related consolidated financial data presented herein have been
     prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles
     which require the measurement of financial position and operating
     results in terms of historical dollars without considering changes in
     the relative purchasing power of money over time due to inflation. 
     The primary impact of inflation on the operation of the Company is
     reflected in increased operating costs.  Unlike industrial companies,
     virtually all of the assets and liabilities of a financial institution
     are monetary in nature.  As a result, interest rates have a more
     significant impact on a financial institution's performance than the
     effects of general levels of inflation.  Interest rates  generally
     move in the same direction and with the same magnitude as the expected 
     rate of inflation.  Management believes that continuation of its
     efforts to manage the rates, liquidity and interest sensitivity of the
     Company's assets and liabilities is necessary to generate an
     acceptable return.
            
             Supervision and Regulation.  VFSC and the Banks are subject to
     extensive regulation under federal and state banking laws and  
     regulations.  The following discussion of certain of the material  
     elements of the regulatory framework applicable to banks and bank
     holding companies is not intended to be complete and is qualified in
     its entirety by the text of the relevant state and federal statutes
     and regulations.  A change in the applicable laws or regulations may
     have a material effect on the business of VFSC and/or the Banks. 
            
     Regulation of VFSC
            
             General.  As a bank holding company, VFSC is subject to
     supervision and regulation by the Board of Governors of the Federal
     Reserve System (the "Federal Reserve Board") under the Bank Holding
     Company Act of 1956, as amended (the "BHC Act").  Under the BHC Act,
     bank holding companies generally may not acquire  ownership or control
     of more than 5% of any class of voting shares or substantially all of
     the assets of any company, including a bank, without the prior
     approval of the Federal Reserve Board.  In addition, bank holding
     companies are generally  prohibited under the BHC Act from engaging in
     non-banking activities, subject to  certain exceptions.  VFSC's
     activities are limited generally to the business of banking and
     activities determined by the Federal Reserve Board to be so closely
     related to banking as to be a proper incident thereto.  The Federal
     Reserve Board has authority to issue cease and desist orders and
     assess civil money penalties against bank holding companies and their
     non-bank subsidiaries, officers, directors and other
     institution-affiliated parties and to remove officers, directors and  
     other institution-affiliated parties to terminate or prevent unsafe or
     unsound banking practices or violations of laws or regulations.
            
             Dividends.  The Federal Reserve Board has authority to
     prohibit bank holding companies from paying dividends if such payment
     would be an unsafe or unsound practice.  The Federal Reserve Board has
     indicated generally that it may be an unsound practice for bank
     holding companies  to pay dividends unless the bank holding company's
     net income over the preceding year is sufficient to fund the dividends
     and the expected rate of earnings retention is consistent with the
     organization's capital needs, asset quality, and overall financial
     condition.  VFSC's ability to pay dividends is dependent upon the flow
     of dividend income to it from VNB and UB, which may be affected or
     limited by regulatory restrictions imposed by federal or state bank
     regulatory agencies.  At December 31, 1994 the Banks had available
     approximately $24.8 million for payment of dividends to VFSC under
     regulatory  guidelines.  VFSC has a policy to pay out over time 30% -
     35% of net income to shareholders in the form of cash dividends. 
     Earnings for prior years as well as prospective earnings are  
     analyzed to determine compliance with this policy.  Dividend payout
     rates  for any one year may vary from this long term payout policy
     based on these analyses and projections of future earnings and future
     capital needs.  For the three-year period ended December 31, 1994, an
     aggregate of $0.91 per share of dividends were declared.  Earnings per
     share for the same period were $5.13.
            
             Certain Transactions by Bank Holding Companies with Their  
     Affiliates.  There are various legal restrictions on the extent to
     which bank holding companies and their non-bank subsidiaries can
     borrow, obtain  credit from or otherwise engage in "covered
     transactions" with their insured depository institution subsidiaries. 
     Such borrowings and other covered transactions by an insured
     depository institution subsidiary (and its subsidiaries) with its
     non-depository institution affiliates are limited to the following
     amounts:  (a) in the case of any one such affiliate, the aggregate
     amount of covered transactions of the insured depository institutions
     and its subsidiaries cannot exceed 10% of the capital stock and
     surplus of the insured depository institution; (b) in the case of all
     affiliates, the aggregate amount of stock and surplus of the insured
     depository institution.  "Covered transactions" are defined by statute
     for these purposes to include a loan or extension of credit to an
     affiliate, a purchase of or investment in securities issued by an
     affiliate, a purchase of assets from an affiliate unless exempted by
     the Federal Reserve Board, the acceptance of securities issued by an  
     affiliate as collateral for a loan or extension of credit to any
     person or company, or the issuance of a guarantee, acceptance or
     letter of credit on behalf of an affiliate.  Covered transactions are
     also subject to certain collateral security requirements.  Further, a
     bank holding company and its subsidiaries are prohibited from engaging
     in certain tying arrangements in connection with any extension of
     credit, lease or sale of property of any kind, or furnishing of any
     service.
            
             Holding Company Support of Subsidiary Banks.  Under Federal
     Reserve Board policy, VFSC is expected to act as a source of financial
     strength to the Banks and to commit resources to support them.  This
     support of the Banks may be required at times when, absent such
     Federal Reserve Board policy, VFSC might not otherwise be inclined to
     provide it.  In addition, any capital loans by a bank holding company
     to any of its subsidiary banks are subordinate in right of payment to
     deposits and  certain other indebtedness of such subsidiary banks.  In
     the event of a bank holding company's bankruptcy, any commitment by
     the bank holding company to a federal bank regulatory agency to
     maintain capital of a subsidiary bank will be assumed by the
     bankruptcy trustee and entitled to a priority of payment.  
            
             Under the Federal Deposit Insurance Act, as amended ("FDI
     ACT"), an  FDIC-insured depository institution, such as VNB or UB can
     be held liable  for any loss incurred by, or reasonably expected to be
     incurred by, the  FDIC after August 9, 1989 in connection with (i) the
     "default" of a   commonly controlledFDIC-insured depository
     institution, or (ii) any  assistance provided by the FDIC to any
     commonly controlled depository  institution in "danger of default". 
     For these purposes, the term "default" is defined generally as the
     appointment of a conservator or receiver and "in danger of default" is
     defined generally as the existence of certain conditions indicating
     that a default is likely to occur without Federal regulatory
     assistance.
            
     Regulation of VNB and UB
            
             General.  As a national bank, VNB is subject to supervision of
     and regulation by the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (the
     "OCC").  UB is a stock-owned  Massachusetts-chartered savings bank
     whose deposits are insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance
     Corporation (FDIC) and the Depositors Insurance Fund (DIF).  
     Accordingly, UB is subject to examination, regulation and supervision
     by both the FDIC and the  Massachusetts Commissioner of Banks.  The
     Banks are also members of the  Federal Home Loan Bank of Boston.
            
             Examinations and Supervision.  As a Massachusetts-chartered
     savings bank UB is regulated and supervised by the Massachusetts
     Commissioner of  Banks.  The Commissioner is required to examine each
     state-chartered bank  at least once every two years.  The
     Commissioner's approval is required  for establishing or closing
     branches, for merging with other banks and  other activities.
            
             Any Massachusetts-chartered savings bank that does not operate
     inaccordance with the Commissioner's regulations, policies and
     directives may be subject to sanctions for non-compliance.  The
     Commissioner may, under certain circumstances, suspend or remove
     directors or officers who have violated the law, conducted the Bank's
     business in a manner which is unsafe, unsound or contrary to the
     depositor's interests, or have been negligent in the performance of
     their duties.  
            
             Massachusetts-chartered savings banks can exercise powers  
     substantially equivalent to those of state-chartered commercial banks. 
     A wide variety of mortgage loans, including fixed and variable-rate, 
     renegotiable-rate and graduated payment loans, and construction,  
     condominium and cooperative loans, may be made on the security of real
     estate located in Massachusetts, or another New England state or New
     York if the Bank has an office in such state or under certain other    
     circumstances.  Certain mortgage loans may be made on the security of 
     improved or unimproved real estate located throughout the United
     States.
            
             Commercial and consumer loans may be made, with or without 
     security, without geographic limitation.  No percentage of assets 
     limitation exists with respect to the aggregate amount of commercial 
     loans that a Massachusetts savings bank may have outstanding; however,
     as a stock-owned savings bank, loans to one borrower generally will be 
     limited to 20% of the Bank's stockholders' equity.
            
             Investments in debt securities may be made without geographic 
     limitation, subject to the limitations on loans to one borrower.  
     Investments in equity securities are not prohibited to state banks
     under the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation Improvement Act of
     1991 unless the FDIC deems otherwise (see Recent Federal Banking
     Legislation).  In addition, Massachusetts-chartered savings banks may
     invest in the capital stock of other banks and bank holding companies,
     subject to the limitations of the Federal and Massachusetts bank
     holding company statutes.
            
             Subject to applicable regulations and required approvals,  
     Massachusetts savings banks may also engage in leasing activities, act
     as trustee or custodian for tax-qualified retirement plans, establish
     a trust department, and establish mortgage banking companies and
     discount brokerage operations.  Subject to certain limits, a
     Massachusetts chartered savings bank may also invest an amount up to
     5% of its   deposits in investments not otherwise legally permitted a
     savings bank, and up to 2% in any one such investment, provided that
     amounts in excess   of 3% of deposits must be invested in companies
     organized for the purpose  of acquiring, constructing, rehabilitating,
     leasing, financing and  disposing of housing.  This "leeway" authority
     cannot be used to alter statutory limits on the aggregate amounts that
     can be invested in any  specific class of investment.  See "Recent
     Banking Legislation".         
     
             The OCC regularly examines the operations of VNB, including
     but not limited to its capital adequacy, reserves, loans, investments,
     earnings,liquidity, compliance with laws and regulations, record of  
     performance under the Community Reinvestment Act and management  
     practices.  In addition, VNB is required to furnish quarterly and
     annual reports of income and condition to the FDIC and periodic
     reports to the OCC.  
     
                  The enforcement authority of the FDIC includes the power
     to impose civil money penalties, terminate insurance coverage, remove 
     officers and directors and issue cease-and-desist orders to prevent 
     unsafe or unsound practices or violations of laws or regulations 
     governing its business.  In addition, under recent federal banking        
     legislation, the FDIC has authority to impose additional restrictions
     and  requirements with respect to banks that do not satisfy applicable
     regulatory capital requirements.  
            
             The FDIC has authority to prevent VNB or UB from paying
     dividends if such payment would constitute an unsafe or unsound
     banking practice or reduce their capital below safe and sound levels. 
     In addition, recently enacted federal legislation prohibits
     FDIC-insured depository institutions from paying dividends or making
     capital distributions that would cause the institution to fail to meet
     minimum capital requirements.   
            
             Affiliate Transactions.  The Banks are subject to restrictions
     imposed by federal law on extensions of credit to, purchases from, and
     certain other transactions with, affiliates, and on investments in
     stock  or other securities issued by affiliates.  Such restrictions
     prevent the  Banks from making loans to affiliates unless the loans
     are secured by  collateral in specified amounts and have terms at
     least as favorable to  the Banks as the terms of comparable
     transactions between the Banks and  non-affiliates.  Further, federal
     laws significantly restrict extensions of credit by the Banks to their
     directors, executive officers  and principal stockholders and related
     interests of such persons.
            
             Deposit Insurance.  The Banks' deposits are insured by the
     Bank Insurance Fund ("BIF") of the FDIC to the legal maximum of
     $100,000 for  each insured depositor.  The Federal Deposit Insurance
     Act provides that the FDIC shall set deposit insurance assessment
     rates on a semi-annual  basis at a level sufficient to increase the
     ratio of BIF reserves to  BIF-insured deposits to at least 1.25% over
     a 15-year period  commencing in 1991.  The FDIC established a
     framework of risk-based insurance assessments to accomplish this
     increase.  See "Recent Banking Legislation-Risk-Based Deposit
     Insurance Assessments" below.  The BIF insurance assessments may be
     increased further in the future if necessary to restore and maintain
     BIF reserves.  However, it is anticipated that the BIF reserve will
     reach its 1.25% goal some time in 1995 at which time BIF assessments
     will be decreased.
            
             Federal Reserve Board Policies.  The monetary policies and 
     regulations of the  Federal Reserve Board have had a significant
     effect on the operating results of banks in the past and are expected
     to continue to do so in the future.  Federal Reserve Board Policies
     affect the levels of bank earnings on loans and investments and the
     levels of interest paid on bank deposits through the Federal Reserve
     System's open-market operations in United States government
     securities, regulation   of the discount rate on bank borrowings from
     Federal Reserve Banks and  regulation of non-earning reserve
     requirements applicable to bank deposit  account balances.
            
              Consumer Protection Regulation; Bank Secrecy Act.  Other
     aspects  of the lending and deposit business of the Banks that are
     subject to  regulation by the FDIC, the Commissioner and the OCC
     include disclosure  requirements with respect to interest, payment and
     other terms of consumer and residential mortgage loans and disclosure
     of interest and fees and other terms of and the availability of funds
     for withdrawal from consumer deposit accounts.  In addition, the Banks
     are subject to  federal and state laws and regulations prohibiting
     certain forms of discrimination in credit transactions, and imposing
     certain record  keeping, reporting and disclosure requirements with
     respect to residential mortgage loan applications.  In addition, the
     Banks are subject to federal laws establishing certain record keeping,     
     customer identification, and reporting requirements with respect to 
     certain large cash transactions, sales of travelers checks or other  
     monetary instruments and the international transportation of cash or  
     monetary instruments.
            
             Federal Home Loan Bank System.  The Banks are members of the 
     Federal Home Loan Bank of Boston, one of 12 regional Federal Home Loan 
     Banks ("FHL Banks"), each subject to Federal Housing Finance Board  
     ("FHFB") supervision and regulation.  The FHL Banks provide a central 
     credit facility for member-insured institutions.  As a member of the
     FHLB of Boston, the Banks are required to own shares of capital stock
     in the bank in a amount at least equal to 1% of the aggregate
     principal amount  of its unpaid residential mortgage loans, home
     purchase contracts, and  similar obligations at the beginning of each
     year, or 1/20 of its advances (borrowings) from the FHL Bank,
     whichever is greater.  The Banks  are in compliance with this
     requirement with an investment in FHLB stock  at December 31, 1994 of
     $7.2 million.  The maximum amount which the FHLB  of Boston will
     advance for purposes other than meeting withdrawals  fluctuates from
     time to time in accordance with changes in policies of  the FHLB and
     the FHLB of Boston, and the maximum amount is reduced by borrowings
     from any other source except debentures with more than one   year to
     maturity and/or debentures covered by a sinking fund.
            
     Capital Requirements
            
             General.  The FDIC has established guidelines with respect to
     the  maintenance of appropriate levels of capital by FDIC-insured
     banks.  The Federal Reserve Board  has established substantially
     identical guidelines with respect to the maintenance of appropriate
     levels of capital, on a consolidated basis, by bank holding companies. 
     If a banking  organization's capital levels fall below the minimum
     requirements established by such guidelines, a bank or bank holding
     company will be expected to develop and implement a plan acceptable to
     the FDIC or the Federal Reserve Board, respectively, to achieve
     adequate levels of capital within a reasonable period, and may be
     denied approval to acquire or establish additional banks or non-bank
     businesses, merge with other  institutions or open branch facilities
     until such capital levels are achieved.  Federal legislation requires
     federal bank regulators to take "prompt corrective action" with
     respect to insured depository institutions that fail to satisfy
     minimum capital requirements and imposes significant restrictions on
     such institutions.  
            
             Leverage Capital Ratio.  The regulations of the FDIC require 
     FDIC-insured banks to maintain a minimum "Leverage Capital Ratio" or 
     "Tier 1 Capital" (as defined in the Risk-Based Capital Guidelines 
     discussed in the following paragraphs) to total assets of 3.0%.  The 
     regulations of the FDIC state that only banks with the highest      
     federal bank regulatory examination rating will be permitted to
     maintain an additional margin of capital, equal to at least 1% to 2%
     of total assets, above the minimum ratio.  Any bank experiencing or
     anticipating significant growth is expected to maintain capital well
     above the minimum levels.  The Federal Reserve Board's guidelines
     impose substantially similar leverage capital requirements on bank
     holding companies on a consolidated basis.
            
             Risk-Based Capital Requirements.  The regulations of the FDIC
     also require FDIC-insured banks to maintain minimum capital levels
     measured as a percentage of  such banks' risk-adjusted assets.  A
     bank's capital for this purpose may include two components - "Core"
     (Tier 1) Capital and "Supplementary" (Tier 2) Capital.  Core Capital
     consists primarily of common stockholders' equity, which generally
     includes common stock,  related surplus and retained earnings, certain
     non-cumulative  perpetual preferred stock and primarily goodwill. 
     Supplementary Capital elements include, subject to certain
     limitations, a portion of the  allowance for losses on loans and
     leases, perpetual preferred stock that  does not qualify for inclusion
     in Tier 1 capital, long-term preferred  stock with an original
     maturity of at least 20 years for issuance and related surplus,
     certain forms of perpetual debt and mandatory  convertible securities,
     and certain forms of subordinated debt and intermediate-term preferred
     stock.
            
             The risk-based capital rules of the FDIC and the Federal
     Reserve  Board assign a bank's balance sheet assets and the credit
     equivalent amounts of the bank's off-balance sheet obligations to one
     of four risk categories, weighted at 0%, 20%, 50% or 100%,
     respectively.  Applying  these risk-weights to eachcategory of the
     bank's balance sheet assets and  to the credit equivalent amounts of
     the bank's off-balance sheet obligations and summing the totals
     results in the amount of the bank's total Risk-Adjusted Assets for
     purposes of the risk-based capital  requirements.  Risk-Adjusted
     Assets can either exceed or be less than  reported balance sheet
     assets, depending on the risk profile of the  banking organization. 
     Risk-Adjusted Assets for institutions such as VNB  and UB will
     generally be less than reported balance sheet assets because their
     retail banking activities include proportionally more residential 
     mortgage loans with a lower risk weighting and relatively smaller 
     off-balance sheet obligations.
            
             Current risk-based capital regulations require all banks to 
     maintain a minimum ratio of Total Capital to Risk-Adjusted Assets of 
     8.0%, of which at least one-half (4.0%) must be Core (Tier 1) Capital.
     For the purpose of calculating these ratios:  (i) a banking 
     organization's Supplementary Capital eligible for inclusion in Total     
     Capital is limited to no more than 100% of Core Capital; and (ii) the 
     aggregate amount of certain types of Supplementary Capital eligible
     for inclusion in Total Capital is further limited.  The regulations
     limit the portion of the allowance for loan losses eligible for
     inclusion in Total Capital to 1.25% of Risk-Adjusted Assets.  The
     Federal Reserve Board has  established substantially identical
     risk-based capital requirements to be  applied to bank holding
     companies on a consolidated basis.
            
             Consequences of Failing to Meet Capital Requirements.  A
     number of sanctions  may be imposed on FDIC-insured banks that are not
     in compliance with the capital regulations, including, among other
     things, restrictions on asset growth and imposition of a capital
     directive that may require, among other things, an increase in
     regulatory capital, reduction of rates paid on savings accounts, 
     cessation of or limitations on deposit-taking, lending, purchasing
     loans, making specified investments, or issuing new accounts, limits
     on operational expenditures, an  increase in liquidity and such other
     restrictions or corrective actions as the FDIC may deem necessary or
     appropriate.  In addition, any FDIC-insured bank that is not      
     meeting its capital requirements must provide the FDIC with prior  
     notice before the addition of any new director or senior officer.
            
             A bank having less than the minimum Tier 1 leverage capital
     ratio must, within 60 days of the date as of which it fails to comply
     with such requirements, submit to its FDIC regional director for
     review and approval a reasonable plan describing the  means and timing
     by which the bank shall achieve its minimum leverage capital       
     requirement.  A bank that fails to file such plan with the FDIC is  
     deemed to be operating in an unsafe and unsound manner, which could
     subject the bank to a  cease-and-desist order from the FDIC.  The
     capital regulations also  provide that any insured depository
     institution with a Tier 1 leverage capital ratio that is less       
     than 2% is deemed to be operating in an unsafe or unsound condition 
     pursuant to Section 8(a) of the FDIA and is subject to potential
     termination of deposit insurance.  Such an institution, however, will
     not be subject to an enforcement proceeding thereunder solely on
     account of its capital ratios if it has entered into and is in
     compliance with a written agreement with the FDIC to increase its Tier
     1 leverage capital ratio to such level as the FDIC deems appropriate  
     and to take such other action as may be necessary for the institution
     to be operated in a safe and  sound manner.  The capital regulations
     also provide, among other things, for the issuance by the FDIC or its
     designee(s) of a capital directive, which is a final order issued to a
     bank to restore its capital to the minimum leverage capital      
     requirement within a specified time period.  Such a directive is  
     enforceable in the same manner as a final cease-and-desist order.
            
             Any material failure to comply with the provisions of any
     capital plan or a capital-related regulation, written agreement, order
     or directive will be treated by the FDIC as an unsafe and unsound
     practice.  Any plan or agreement between the FDIC and a bank is
     enforceable by cease-and-desist orders and by civil penalties for
     violations of regulatory orders or agreements.  Unsafe and unsound 
     practices and  violations of regulatory orders or agreements also
     constitute grounds for termination of deposit insurance.
            
             Each federal banking agency is also required to implement a
     system of prompt corrective action for institutions which it
     regulates.  The federal banking agencies have promulgated
     substantially similar regulations to implement the  system of prompt       
     corrective action.  Under the regulations, a bank is deemed to be  (i) 
     "well capitalized" if it has total risk-based capital of 10% or more,
     a   Tier  1 risk-based capital ratio of 6% or more, a Tier 1 leverage
     capital ratio of 5%  or  more and is not subject to any written
     agreement, order, capital directive, or  corrective action      
     directive, (ii) "adequately capitalized" if it has a total  risk-based
     capital ratio of 8% or more, a Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio of 4%
     or more and Tier 1 leverage capital ratio of 4% or more (3% under
     certain circumstances) and does  not meet the definition of "well
     capitalized", (iii) "undercapitalized" if it has  a  total      
     risk-based capital ratio that is less than 8%, a Tier 1 risk-based 
     capital ratio that is less than 4% or a Tier 1 leverage capital ratio
     that is less  than 4%  (3% under certain circumstances), (iv)
     "significantly undercapitalized"  if  it has a total risk-based
     capital ratio that is less than 6%, a Tier 1  risk-based capital
     ratio that is less than 3% or a Tier 1 leverage capital ratio that  is 
     less than 3%, and (v) "critically undercapitalized" if it has a ratio
     of tangible  equity to total assets that is equal to or less than 2%. 
            
             At December 31, 1994, VFSC's consolidated Total and Tier 1 
     risk-based  capital ratios were 13.03% and 11.77%, respectively. 
     These ratios exceeded  applicable regulatory requirements.  VFSC, VNB
     and UB are all considered "well  capitalized" by their respective
     regulators. In 1993 UB entered into a memorandum of  understanding      
     with the FDIC and the Massachusetts Commissioner of Banks requiring 
     UB, among other things, to maintain a certain minimum Tier 1 Leverage
     Capital Ratio.   UB complied with the memorandum from its inception,
     and it was rescinded by the  regulators on March 29, 1994.
            
            
     Recent Banking Legislation
            
             The Riegle-Neal Interstate Banking and Branching Efficiency
     Act of  1994 became effective at the end of 1994.  Under the new law,
     different types of  interstate transactions and activities will be
     permitted, each with different  effective dates. Interstate
     transactions and activities provided for under the new  law  include:
     (i) bank holding company acquisitions of separately held banks in a 
     state  other than a bank holding company's home state; (ii) mergers
     between insured  banks  with different home states, including
     consolidations of affiliated insured banks;  (iii) establishment of
     interstate branches either de novo or by branch  acquisition; and      
     (iv) affiliated banks acting as agents for one another for certain 
     banking functions without being considered a "branch".  In general,
     nationwide  interstate banking will be permissible on June 1, 1997,
     unless a state passes legislation  either to prevent or to permit the
     earlier occurrence of interstate mergers.  States  may  at any time      
     enact legislation permitting interstate de novo branching.  
     Affiliated  banks may act as agents for one another beginning one year
     after enactment.  Each of  the transactions and activities must be
     approved by the appropriate federal bank regulator, with separate and
     specific criteria established for each  category.       
     
             Once the applicable effective date has occurred (and, the case
     of  interstate mergers and de novo branching, subject to applicable
     state law  "opt-out" or "opt-in" provisions), the appropriate federal
     bank regulator may approve the  respective interstate transactions
     only if certain criteria are met.  First, in  order for a banking
     institution (a bank or bank holding company) to receive  approval for
     an interstate transaction, it must be "adequately capitalized" and 
     "adequately managed".  The term "adequately capitalized" is generally
     defined as  meeting or exceeding all applicable federal regulatory
     capital standards; the  phrase "adequately managed" was left
     undefined.  Second, the appropriate  federal bank regulator must
     consider the applicant's and its affiliated  institutions' records      
     under the CRA as well as the applicant's record under applicable 
     state  community reinvestment laws.
            
             The new law applies deposit "concentration limits" to
     interstate  acquisition and merger transactions.  Specifically, a
     banking institution may  not  receive federal approval for interstate
     expansion if it and its affiliates  would control (i) more than 10% of
     the deposits held by all insured depository  institutions in the      
     United States, or (ii) 30% or more of the deposits of all insured 
     depository institutions in any state in which the banks or branches
     involved in  the transactions (or any affiliated depository
     institution) overlap.   States may, by statute, regulation or order,
     raise or lower the 30% limit.  In  addition, the new  law preempts
     certain existing state law restrictions on interstate   banking (such
     as regional compacts and reciprocity requirements), effective one year 
     after enactment.  However, in order to receive federal approval for an
     interstate  merger  or de novo branching transaction, an applicant
     still also must comply with any non-discriminatory host state filing
     and other requirements.
            
             The reaction, if any, of the Vermont, Massachusetts or other
     state  legislatures to the interstate banking legislation is uncertain
     at  this time. However, regardless of the reaction of state
     legislatures, the new  interstate banking law is likely to make it
     easier for out-of-state  institutions  to attempt to purchase or
     otherwise acquire VFSC, VNB, UB or their competitors in  Vermont and      
     western Massachusetts.
            
     Item 2 - Properties
            
             The principal offices of the Company and VNB are located at
     100  Main  Street in Brattleboro, Vermont. VNB operates 30 other
     locations throughout  Vermont in the Counties of Chittenden,
     Washington, Rutland, Bennington, Franklin,  Windsor, Orange and
     Windham.  Eight offices are located in Windham County - The Main 
     Office and two branches in Brattleboro, and offices in Bellows Falls,
     Jamaica,  Newfane, West Dover and Wilmington.  An office is operated
     in Bennington County in the  Town of Bennington, and five offices
     operate in Chittenden County in the City of Burlington, two in South
     Burlington, Essex Junction Winooski.  VNB has six  offices  in Windsor     
     County in the Towns of Chester, Ludlow, Springfield, White River 
     Junction, Windsor and Woodstock.  Four facilities are located in
     Rutland County, three  in Rutland and one in Fair Haven.  Five offices
     are located in Washington County,  one  each located on State Street
     and Main Street in Montpelier, the Berlin Shopping  Mall, Northfield

     (1) Includes a fully taxable equivalent adjustment based on a 34% 
     federal income tax rate.
     (2) Nonaccrual loans are included in average balances.
     (3) Taxable and tax-exempt securities are reflected at amortized 
     cost.
     (4) The difference between the rate earned on total earning assets and 
     the rate paid on total interest-bearing liabilities.
            
             Net interest income increased $0.3 million or 0.6% to $51.1
     million  in 1994 from $50.8 million in 1993. This compared to a $3.7
     million or 7.8% increase in 1993 from 1992. On a fully taxable
     equivalent basis, net interest income increased $0.7 million or 1.3%
     from 1993 to 1994 and $3.9 million or 8.2% from 1992 to 1993.  The      
     smaller increase in 1994 was primarily due to rising interest rates 
     and the resulting 48% decrease in mortgage loan originations.  This
     caused a $2.6 million reduction in related fees and nearly offset the
     income effects of a $64.2 million increase in average earning assets.      
            
             During 1993 the Company significantly reduced its level of 
     nonperforming assets (See "Nonperforming Assets and Risk Elements"
     section following) which improved the net  interest  spread by 0.31%. 
     The 0.27% reduction in the spread in 1994 was caused by the lower loan
     fees noted above.
            
             Average earning assets increased slowly over the last two
     years  with  6.2% and 2.7% growth rates in 1994 and  1993,
     respectively.  The 1994 growth came from a $24.4 million or  2.8% 
     increase in loans and a $37.2 million or 24.1% increase in taxable
     securities.  The growth in loans was  primarily in the municipal area,
     while the growth in the investment portfolio was primarily in U.S.
     Government Agency  Securities.   
            
             Average interest-bearing liabilities increased $45.7 million,
     or   4.9%  in 1994 following a $12.2 million, or 1.3% growth in 1993. 
     Over the two-year period, average core  interest-bearing deposits
     (savings and transactional deposits and certificates of deposit under
     $100,000 increased by  $63.1  million.  Non-core interest-bearing      
     liabilities were reduced by $5.2 million over the same period.
            
            The following table provides an analysis of the variances  in 
     net interest income, on a fully taxable equivalent basis, attributable
     to changes in volume and rate.    Volume  variances are calculated by
     multiplying the  preceding year's rate by the current year's change in
     the average  balance.  Rate variances are calculated by multiplying
     the current year's change in rate by the prior year's  average
     balance.

     Provision for Loan Losses
            
             The provision for loan losses charged to operating expense is
     based upon management's judgment of the  amount necessary to maintain
     the allowance for loan losses at a  level  adequate to absorb possible
     losses.  The factors evaluated include, but are not limited to:  the
     size, composition, growth and quality of the loan portfolio, specific
     and potential problem loans, current economic  conditions and their
     effect on a borrower's performance in relation to contract terms,
     historical loss  experience  by loan type and loan collectibility.
            
             The provision for loan losses in 1994 was $4.0 million
     compared to  $5.1 million in 1993 and $9.4 million in 1992.  Net loans
     charged off were $5.6 million, $8.3 million and  $7.5  million for the
     respective years.  The $4.4 million reduction in the provision for
     1993 was principally due to a  reduction in the level of nonperforming
     assets  (See "Nonperforming Assets and Risk Elements" section
     following) and  management's view that the Vermont economy began a
     slow recovery near the end of 1992.  The provision was  reduced  an
     additional $1.1 million in 1994 as nonperforming asset levels and the
     Company's local economy continued  to improve.
            
     Other Operating Income and Other Operating Expense
            
             In 1994, other operating income decreased $0.7 million, or
     3.8%,  from  the $17.3 million earned in 1993.  Net of the $2.0
     million decrease in securities gains, other  operating  income was up
     $1.4 million, or 9.1%, compared to 1993.  An increase of $0.9 million
     in service charges on deposit  accounts comprised 63% of this
     increase.
            
             In 1993, other operating income, net of securities gains,
     increased  $1.2 million, or 8.6% over 1992.  The two major items
     representing the increase were service charges on  deposit accounts
     and mortgage servicing income. Respectively, they contributed $470,000
     and $341,000 to the  increase.   Noninterest income is expected to
     continue to grow at a similar pace in 1995.
            
             Total other operating expense decreased $5.7 million, or 11%,
     in  1994  after increasing $7.1 million, or 16%, in 1993.  Net OREO
     and collection expenses and losses  represented  $5.1 million, or 89%,
     of the decrease in 1994, and $4.0 million, or 56%, of the increase in
     1993.  Salary  expense was $17.8 million in 1994, $18.4 million      
     in 1993 and $17.8 million in 1992.  These represent a decrease of 3% 
     and an increase of 3%, respectively, reflecting a reduction of
     approximately 7% in the Company's average  number of employees over
     the last two years.  Pension and employee benefits decreased $0.3
     million, or 6%, in 1994  after increasing $1.1 million, or 28%, in      
     1993.  The increase in 1993 was largely due to early retirement and 
     termination costs.  Partially offsetting the expense improvements in
     1994 was an increase of $0.4 million in  expenses related to the
     merger with West Mass  Bankshares (See Note 2. to the consolidated
     financial statements).   See also "Recent Developments".
            
     Applicable Income Taxes
            
             During 1994, 1993 and 1992 the Company recorded income tax
     expense  of  $5.2 million, $3.4 million and $2.4 million,
     respectively.  The changes were almost entirely due to the  level of
     pre-tax earnings.  See also footnote 11 to the financial statements.
            
     Financial Condition
            
     Loans
             The loan portfolio increased $39.1 million, or 4.5%, in 1994
     following a $15.7 million, or 1.8%, increase in 1993.  In structuring
     the composition of its loan portfolio, the  Company considers the
     following factors:  profitability, liquidity, risk, rate sensitivity
     and service in its  market area.  It tries to maintain a balance      
     between commercial lending (commercial , commercial real estate and 
     construction loans) and consumer lending (residential real estate and
     consumer loans) with each representing  between 40% and 60% of the
     total loan portfolio.  Over the last two years the commercial lending
     sector increased $7.2 million but decreased from 48% to 46% of the
     total loan portfolio.
            
             Through its subsidiary Banks the Company makes commercial
     business loans to small and medium sized  businesses in Vermont and
     Massachusetts and is the leading  commercial  lender in the State of
     Vermont.
            
             Construction and commercial loans secured by real estate
     include  loans secured by residential and  commercial properties,
     office and industrial buildings, condominium  development and land
     development properties.  The Company limits both of these types of
     lending activities and the  properties securing these loans to its
     primary market areas in Vermont and Massachusetts, and adjacent
     communities  in  neighboring states.   Approximately 60% of the
     commercial real estate portfolio represents loans on owner  occupied
     properties.  Real estate values in Vermont have been depressed as a
     result of the recent recession in New  England  and the Nation, but
     have experienced some  recent improvement.  Management's goal is to
     keep the construction  loan portion of the loan portfolio below 5% of      
     total loans.  As of December 31, 1994 this sector represented 2.7%  of 
     the portfolio.
            
             In 1994, the Company originated $140.5 million of residential 
     mortgage loans and sold $86.9 million of loans in the secondary
     market, compared to $267.2 million originated  and $189.7 million sold
     in 1993 and $291.3  million originated and $192.4 million sold in
     1992.  The 48%  decrease  in mortgage loan originations was primarily      
     due to rising interest rates.  The high levels of 1993 and 1992 were 
     in part due to lower interest rates which led to a significant number
     of mortgage refinancings.  
            
             At year end 1994, the mortgage servicing portfolio totaled
     $459.2  million compared to $458.7 million at year end 1993 and $439.8
     million at year end 1992 and currently  generates income of
     approximately $2.0 million per year.  Of the residential real estate
     portfolio, 68.7% were  adjustable  rate loans and 31.3% were fixed

     Nonperforming Assets and Risk Elements
            
             It is the Company's policy to manage the loan portfolio so as
     to  recognize and respond to problem loans at an early stage and
     thereby minimize losses.  All new loan  originations, loan renewals,
     loans categorized as past due and classified loans are reviewed on a
     weekly basis by the  administrative officers in charge of the
     commercial,  mortgage and consumer loan portfolios.  In turn, the
     status of these  loans is reported in detail to senior management and
     the Loan Committee of the Board of Directors on a  monthly basis. 
     From these reviews, determinations are made on a case-by-case basis as
     to the collectibility of principal and interest.
            
             Nonreceipt of contractually due principal or interest payments
     on loans 30 days after the due date results in their being reported as
     past due with increased monitoring and  collecting efforts to restore
     such loans to current status.  Mortgage loans are classified as
     nonaccrual and  placed on a cash basis for purposes of income      
     recognition when they become 180 days past due or when foreclosure 
     action is started whichever is sooner. Commercial loans are placed on
     nonaccrual status and placed on a  cash  basis when they become 90
     days past due as to  principal or interest, unless they are adequately
     collateralized or  are expected to result in collection within the      
     next 60 days.  While no specific period of delinquency triggers 
     nonaccrual status for consumer loans, unsecured installment loans 90
     days or more past due and secured installment  loans 180 days or more
     past due are generally recommended for charge-off.
            
             A loan remains in nonaccrual status until the factors which 
     indicate  doubtful collectibility no longer exist and at least six
     consecutive months of contractual payments  are  received or until the
     loan is determined to be uncollectible and is charged off against the
     allowance for loan  losses.  Credit card loans are required to be      
     charged off after 180 days without a payment.  Commercial loans 180 
     days or more past due must be recommended for charge-off unless
     management determines the collateral is  sufficient.   When a mortgage
     loan in default is transferred to OREO, its carrying value is the
     lesser of the loan  amount or the fair value of the property      
     collateralizing the loan, less the estimated cost to sell the 
     property.  A loan is classified as a restructured loan when the
     interest rate is materially reduced or when the term  is  extended
     beyond the original maturity date because of the inability of the
     borrower to service the interest  payments at the contractual rate. 
     All of the $0.3 million of accruing restructured loans as of December
     31, 1994 were  in  full compliance with restructured terms and      
     conditions.  An additional $0.6 million of loans have been 
     restructured and are in full compliance with restructured terms and
     conditions.  However, as there remains some  doubt as to the ultimate
     collectibility of all principal and interest on these loans, they are
     classified as  nonaccrual as of December 31, 1994 in the table      
     below.  The average yield on these loans is 7.2%.
            
             The following table provides information with respect to the 
     Company's past due loans and the components of nonperforming assets at

             In December 1993, $5.9 million of insubstance foreclosures
     (ISF)  were  transferred from OREO to loans and are included with
     nonaccrual loans in the above table.  Prior years'  ISF loans have
     been reclassified accordingly.
            
             Additional interest income of $1,320,000 and $1,943,000 would
     have  been recorded in 1994 and 1993, respectively, if nonaccrual and
     restructured loans had been on a  current basis in accordance with
     their original terms.  Payments, totaling $936,000 and $1,562,000
     respectively, were received on nonaccrual loans during 1994 and      
     1993.  During 1994, $592,000 was applied as principal reductions and 
     $344,000 was recognized as interest income,  while in 1993 $1,152,000
     was applied as a principal reduction and   $410,000 was recognized as
     interest income.  Interest income was recognized solely on nonaccrual
     loans which were  subsequently determined to have no doubt as to      
     the ultimate collectibility of principal.
            
             At December 31, 1994, all nonaccrual loans were
     collateralized.  In  addition, it is the Company's policy to      
     obtain personal guarantees of the borrower's whenever it is  possible.
     As of December 31, 1994, 6.5% of the total  nonaccrual loans are
     current as to contractual terms.  Loans to five  borrowers, totaling
     $3.6 million represented  22.0% of nonaccrual loans.  Management
     expects to see moderate  improvement in 1995 over the 1994 charged-off
     loan total with a further decrease in the level of nonperforming
     assets.   Management is not aware of any current recommendations by
     regulatory authorities or suggestions with  respect  to loans
     classified as loss, doubtful, substandard or special mention which, if
     they were implemented,  would  have a material effect on the Company.
            
     Allowance for Loan Losses
            
             The allowance for loan losses is available to absorb future
     losses  which are anticipated in the current  loan portfolio.  The
     adequacy of the allowance for loan losses,  which  is formally
     reviewed on a monthly basis by management, is evaluated according to
     the factors outlined in  "Provision for Loan Losses".  To maintain the    
     allowance at an adequate level, current earnings are charged with an 
     amount necessary to restore the allowance to the desired level.  A
     loan loss is charged against the allowance  when  management believes
     the collectibility of principal and interest with respect to such loan
     is unlikely.  The  allowance for loan losses equalled $16.2          
     million, or 1.78% of the total loan portfolio at December 31, 1994, 
     compared with 2.04% at year end 1993 and 2.46% at year end 1992.  On
     December 31, 1994 the allowance for loan  losses  represented 76% of
     total nonperforming assets and 97% of nonperforming loans, compared to
     56% and 65%,  respectively,  at year end 1993.
            
            
             The following table provides an analysis of the allowance for
     loan  losses and an analysis of loans charged off and recoveries by
     type of loan and for the years indicated.

             Net loans charged off in 1994 totaled $5,579,000 or 0.62% of 
     average  loans.  This compares with $8,285,000 or 0.95% in 1993 and
     $7,499,000 or 0.90% in 1992.  In 1994, 1993 and  1992, no loan charged
     off exceeded 10% of the net loans charged off during the year.  In
     1991 loans charged off  for  one customer totaled $1,125,000.  No
     other charge-offs exceeded 10% of the year's total.  
            
             While all segments of the Company's loan portfolio are subject
     to  continuous quality evaluation, there is no precise method for
     predicting loan losses.  An evaluation of the collectibility of a loan
     requires the exercise of management's judgment.  Since the
     determination of the adequacy  of  the allowance is necessarily
     judgmental and involves consideration of various factors and
     assumptions,  management is of the opinion that an allocation of the      
     reserve is not necessarily indicative of the specific amount of 
     future  charge-offs or the specific loan categories in which these
     charge-offs may ultimately occur.
            
             The following table summarizes the allocation of the allowance
     for  loan losses at December 31, 1994, 1993, 1992, 1991 and 1990. 
     Notwithstanding these allocations, the entire  allowance for loan
     losses is available to absorb charge-offs in any category of loans. 
     Also during the last  five years, management provided an unallocated      
     allowance for expected charge-offs not specifically identified in the 
     loan portfolio.

     Investment Portfolio
             The investment portfolio is utilized primarily for liquidity
     and  secondarily for investment income.  As a result, the portfolio is
     primarily comprised of short-term U. S.  Treasury instruments and high
     grade municipal obligations, mortgage-backed securities and corporate
     bonds with  short  maturities.  These various segments of the    
     investment portfolio and their related income are reported monthly to 
     the Company's Board of Directors.

     (1) Includes money market overnight investments of $1,635, $9,182, 
     and  $4,977 at year end 1994, 1993 and 1992, respectively.
            
             The investment portfolio decreased  5.7%, to $173.9 million,
     at  year  end.  During 1993 the portfolio increased 23.4%, to $184.4
     million at year end.  The total portfolio  as a percent of total
     assets was 14.4% at year end 1994 compared to 15.9% and 13.3% at year
     end 1993 and 1992,  respectively.
            
             On December 31, 1993, the Company adopted Statement of
     Financial  Accounting Standards No. 115 (See Note 1 to the
     Consolidated Financial Statements).  Securities are carried at fair
     market value at December 31, 1994 and December 31, 1993 in the above
     tables.  The 1992 values reflect the amortized cost of the securities. 
     During 1993 the Company and national economy saw record low interest
     rates and  record high repayments in mortgage-backed securities. 
     These mortgage-backed securities include newly issued  and  seasoned
     securities of government housing agencies and those portions of
     agency-backed collateralized mortgage  obligations with relatively
     short and stable average lives.  During 1993 management reinvested the
     proceeds of  sales and prepayments into this portfolio. During 1994
     prepayments were primarily invested in U. S. Treasury  and  other U.
     S. government agency securities as management determined that the
     relative values of these investments  were superior to mortgage-backed
     securities.   The average maturity of the investment portfolio is
     approximately  3.9  years.
            
             The Company invests a portion of its capital in marketable
     equity  securities which comprised 6.9%, 5.5% and 7.3% of total
     investments at December 31, 1994, 1993 and 1992,  respectively.  At
     December 31, 1994, $7.7 million of the $12.0 million marketable equity
     security portfolio were  investments in the Federal Reserve Bank and
     Federal Home Loan Bank.  Investments in these institutions are carried
     at  par,  which equals market.
            
             The following table sets forth the maturities of the Company's 
     investment securities at December 31, 1994 and the weighted average
     yields of such securities.  Weighted  average  yields on tax exempt
     obligations have been  computed on a fully taxable equivalent basis
     assuming a federal tax  rate of 34%.  The yields are calculated by      
     dividing annual interest, net of amortization of premiums and 
     accretion of discounts, by the book value of the securities at
     December 31, 1994.

     Deposits
             Average total deposits for 1994 of $981.5 million represented
     a  $36.2  million, or 3.8%, increase from 1993's average, which had
     decreased $5.5 million, or 0.6%, from  1992's  average balances.         
     The average balance of large CDs was $29.3 million in 1994, $38.1 
     million in 1993 and $80.1 million in 1992.  In 1994 the decrease in
     large CDs was offset by a $44.9  million  total increase in the
     average balance of all other deposit categories, considered core
     deposits by management.   Large CDs represented 3.0% of average total      
     deposits in 1994 versus 4.0% in 1993 and 8.4% in 1992.  The majority 
     of these deposits was obtained from local  Vermont and Massachusetts
     customers.  Management expects to limit  future asset growth primarily
     to the growth of core deposits as opposed to the more volatile large
     CDs and other  borrowed funds.

            Capital Resources
            
             The Company engages in an ongoing assessment of its capital
     needs  in  order to maintain an adequate level of capital to support
     business growth and ensure depositor protection.   The Company's two
     sources of capital are internally generated funds and the capital
     markets.  Primary reliance is on internally generated capital.
            
             Stockholders' equity as a percent of assets was 7.50%, 7.86%
     and  7.42% as of December 31, 1994, 1993 and 1992, respectively. 
     Management's goal is to maintain a 7% equity to  asset ratio so that
     the Company has sufficient capital to take advantage of expansion or
     capital opportunities that  might arise.  Average equity to average
     assets equalled 7.97% in 1994, 7.67% in 1993 and 7.32% in 1992.
            
             As a result of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation
     (FDIC)  Improvement Act of 1991 (FDICIA), bank regulators have
     established uniform capitalization standards as per the following
     table.  The ratios for the Company and its two subsidiary banks as of
     December 31, 1994 and  1993  are shown for comparative purposes
     placing them in the "well capitalized" category at each respective
     date.

</TABLE>
             FDIC insurance rates after 1992 vary depending on a bank's
     capital  ratio and regulatory rating.  Well-capitalized institutions
     will be assessed less than those that are adequately capitalized,
     which are in turn lower than the other categories.  Both banks are
     currently assessed  at  the lowest available FDIC rate, $0.23 per      
     $100 of deposits.
            
     Liquidity and Interest Rate Sensitivity
            
             Liquidity measures the ability of the Company to meet its
     maturing  obligations and existing commitments, to withstand
     fluctuation in deposit levels, to fund its operations and  to  provide
     for customers' credit needs.  Liquidity is monitored by the Company on
     an ongoing basis.  Ready  asset liquidity is provided by cash and due
     from banks, sales of excess funds, loan repayments and an investment 
     portfolio with short maturities and ready marketability.  In addition,
     the Company has a strong core deposit  base which supports a
     significant portion of its earning assets.  Secondary liquidity is
     provided by the potential  sale of loans and other assets, large      
     certificates of deposit, short or long-term debt borrowings, federal 
     funds purchased, repurchase agreements and borrowing from the Federal
     Reserve Bank.  Both subsidiary banks are  also members of the Federal
     Home Loan Bank (FHLB) with combined borrowing capability of $170.3
     million.  
            
             Effective asset/liability management includes maintaining
     adequate liquidity and minimizing the impact of future interest rate
     changes on net interest income.  The Company  attempts to manage its
     interest rate sensitivity position through the composition of its loan
     and investment  portfolios  and by adjusting the average maturity of
     and establishing rates on earning assets in line with its expectations 
     for  future interest rates.  The Company  endeavors to maintain a
     cumulative gap ratio in all periods under  one  year of approximately
     one to one.
            
             The following table summarizes the Company's interest rate 
     sensitivity over various periods at December 31, 1994.

     Recent Developments
            
             During 1995, the Company plans to upgrade its mainframe
     computer's  central processing unit at an anticipated total cost of
     $537,000.  No other additions to premises  or  equipment are expected
     to exceed $500,000. All additions will be funded through the
     operations of the Company.
            
             The Company's financial statements for 1995 will be affected
     by  rules  and regulations which have been announced but are not yet
     effective.  The Financial Accounting  Standards Board (FASB) has
     issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 114,
     "Accounting by  Creditors for Impairment of a Loan".  This statement      
     shall be effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years 
     beginning after December 15, 1994.  This statement is not expected to
     have a material impact on the financial  statements of the Company.
            
             A recent District of Columbia federal court of appeals ruling, 
     Chemical Manufacturers Association vs. Environmental Protection Agency
     No. 92-1314, potentially increased  banks' liabilities for hazardous
     waste cleanup costs.  It is the Company's policy to require Phase I
     site  assessments  from a qualified engineering firm for all      
     real estate loans in excess of $500,000 and any property of concern 
     for loans below $500,000.  Management is not aware of any hazardous
     waste actions against the Company or its  borrowers.
            
            Vermont Financial Services Corp.'s (VFSC) acquisition of West
     Mass  Bankshares, Inc. (WMBS), of Greenfield, MA, was  completed on
     June 14, 1994 and all information in the consolidated  financial
     statements herein, reflect this  transaction.  WMBS' sole banking
     subsidiary, United Savings Bank,  became a wholly owned subsidiary of
     VFSC.  The acquisition was effected as a pooling of interests with an
     exchange   of  .9861 shares of VFSC stock for each share of WMBS
     stock.  As of January 24, 1994, there were 115,800 dissenting  WMBS

       Notes To Consolidated Financial Statements
                 
       1.  Basis of Financial Statements and Significant Accounting        
           Policies
                 
           The accounting and reporting policies of Vermont Financial    
     Services  Corp.  and its subsidiaries (the "Company" or "VFSC") are in
     conformity with generally accepted accounting principles and general
     practices within  the banking industry.  The following is a
     description of the more significant policies.
                 
            The Company, organized in April 1982, became a registered bank      
     holding company, acquired controlling interest in Vermont National
     Bank ("VNB") on March 1, 1983, upon exchange of all of the outstanding
     shares of  common stock of VNB for shares of the Company.  In 1990 the    
     Company changed its State of incorporation from Vermont to Delaware. 
     On June 14, 1994, a merger with West Mass  Bankshares  ("WMBS") was
     effected as a pooling of interest with WMBS' sole banking subsidiary,
     United Savings Bank ("USB"), becoming wholly owned by VFSC. 
     Subsequent to the  merger USB changed its name to United Bank ("UB"). 
     All intercompany transactions have been eliminated in the          
     consolidated financial statements.
                 
                  Cash equivalents include amounts due from banks, interest    
     bearing  deposits with other banks and federal funds sold and
     securities purchased under agreements to resell with  original
     maturities of three months or less.  
                 
                  Effective December 31, 1993 the Company adopted, on a    
     prospective basis, Statement of Financial Accounting Standards
     ("SFAS") No. 115, "Accounting for Certain Investments in Debt and
     Equity Securities" and revised its  securities accounting policy. 
     Securities that may be sold as part of the Company's asset/liability
     or liquidity management or in response to or in anticipation of
     changes in interest rates and resulting prepayment risk, or for           
     other similar factors, are classified as available for sale and      
     carried at fair market value which is based on quoted market prices or
     dealer quotes.  Unrealized holding  gains and losses on such
     securities are reported net of related taxes as a separate component
     of shareholders' equity.  Realized gains and losses on the sales of
     all securities are reported in earnings and computed using the    
     specific identification cost basis.  The adoption of SFAS No. 115 was
     not applied retroactively to prior years' financial statements.
                 
                  Prior to December 31, 1993 all securities were classified
     as available for sale and were carried at the lower of aggregate cost
     or market value.  Unrealized losses on marketable equity securities
     were reported as a  separate component of shareholders' equity unless
     the loss was deemed  to be other than temporary in which case a           
     charge to earnings was made.            
     
                  The Financial Accounting Standards Board has issued SFAS
     No. 114,  "Accounting by Creditors for Impairment  of a Loan", which
     requires that creditors value all impaired loans,  as  defined in the
     statement, based on the present value of expected cash flows
     discounted at the loan's effective interest rate, or as a practical
     expedient,  at the market price of the loan or the fair value of the    
     collateral securing the loan if the loan is collateral dependent.  The
     standard is required for fiscal years beginning  after December 15,
     1994.  The Company does not believe adoption of the standard will have
     a significant impact  on  its results of operations or financial
     position.
                 
                  The reserve for loan losses is maintained at a level
     which, in management's judgment, is adequate to absorb  future loan
     losses through charges to operating expenses.  Principal factors
     considered by management include the   historical loan loss
     experience, the value and adequacy of collateral, the level of
     nonperforming (nonaccrual)  loans, the growth and composition of the
     loan portfolio and  examination of individual loans by senior
     management.
                 
                  OREO is carried at the lower of cost or fair value less
     the estimated cost to sell the property.
                 
                  Premises and equipment are stated at cost less
     accumulated depreciation and amortization.  Depreciation is           
     computed principally on the straight-line method over the    
     estimated  useful life of the related assets.  Leasehold  improvements
     are amortized over the lease periods or the useful life  of the
     improvement, whichever is shorter. When assets are sold or retired,
     the related cost and accumulated  depreciation and amortization are
     removed from the respective accounts and any gain or loss is credited
     or charged to income.
                 
                  Goodwill and other intangibles are amortized over their    
     estimated lives by the straight-line method.  As  part of its ongoing
     review, management estimates the value of the  Company's intangible
     assets, taking into consideration any events and circumstances which
     might have diminished such value.
                 
                  In the fourth quarter of 1992, the Company adopted SFAS
     No.109, "Accounting for Income Taxes", which requires recognition of
     deferred tax liabilities and assets for the expected future tax
     consequences of events that have been included in the financial
     statements or tax returns.  Under this method, deferred tax
     liabilities and assets are determined based on the difference between
     the financial statement and tax bases of assets and liabilities using
     enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which the differences are
     expected to reverse.   
                 
                  Prior to that time, the provision for income taxes was
     based on income and expenses included in the accompanying consolidated
     statements of operations.  Differences between taxes so computed and
     taxes payable under  applicable statutes and regulations were
     classified as deferred  taxes.
                 
                  Securities and other property held by the Trust
     Department in a  fiduciary or agency capacity are not  included in the
     accompanying balance sheet, since such items are not  assets of the
     Bank.  Trust Department income is recorded on the cash basis which is
     not materially different  from income that would be reported on the
     accrual basis.
                 
                  Loan origination and commitment fees and certain direct
     loan origination costs are deferred and amortized as an adjustment of
     the related loan's yield over the contractual life  of the related
     loans by the level yield  method.
                 
                  Effective January 1, 1993, the Company adopted SFAS No.
     106, "Employers' Accounting for Postretirement Benefits Other Than
     Pensions".  SFAS 106 changed the Company's  policy of accounting for
     postretirement benefits on a pay-as-you-go (cash) basis by requiring
     accrual of the expected  cost of providing these benefits.
                 
                  Dollars in the following footnotes are in thousands
     except for per share amounts.
                 
     2. Merger with WestMass Bankshares, Inc.
                 
             On June 14, 1994, the shareholders of WMBS and VFSC    
     consummated a merger which resulted in WMBS' sole subsidiary, USB,
     becoming a wholly owned subsidiary of VFSC.  Under the terms of the
     merger, WMBS shareholders  received .9861 shares of VFSC stock for
     each WMBS share.  As a  result, VFSC issued 1,122,696 shares of its
     common  stock for all the outstanding shares of WMBS common stock,
     with the exception of 115,800 dissenting WMBS.  Although  management
     does not know the final outcome of the disposition  of the dissenting
     shareholders, the per share data in the financial statements assume an
     exchange at .9861 per share for  all shares.
                 
             The merger was effected as a pooling of interests and    
     accordingly,  VFSC's financial statements have been restated to
     include the results of WMBS for all periods presented.
                 
             Combined and separate results of VFSC and WMBS during the    
     periods  preceding the merger were as follows:

                  The combined financial results presented above include
     adjustments made to conform accounting policies of the two companies. 
     None of the adjustments impacted previously  reported net income.  All
     adjustments are reclassifications to conform financial statement
     presentation.  These reclassifications include USB transferring           
     its investment portfolio from "Held-to-Maturity" to "Available for      
     Sale" at December 31, 1993.  There were no intercompany transactions
     between the two companies during the periods presented above.
                 
                  In connection with the merger, the Company recorded
     expenses of $466 in 1994.  These expenses represent printing,
     investment advisory, legal, audit and other professional service fees.

                  The Company grants loans to customers primarily in New    
     England.   Although the Company has a diversified portfolio, its
     debtors' ability to honor their contracts is substantially dependent
     upon the general economic conditions of the region.
                 
                  At December 31, 1994 the amount of loans outstanding to    
     directors, executive officers, principal holders of equity securities
     or to any of their associates totaled $7,639.

     Mortgage Banking Activities
                 
                  During 1994 the Company originated $77,001 of mortgage
     loans for sale in the secondary market and sold  $86,876.  As of
     December 31, 1994, $4,232 of mortgage loans  were held  for sale and
     were carried at the lesser of the loan balance or market value.  All
     loans are sold without recourse, except for certain technical
     underwriting exceptions and $2,999 and $1,059 in loans sold by UB to
     the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation and South Boston          
     Savings Bank, respectively,  under recourse agreements.  None have      
     been presented for recourse.  Loan servicing is  retained by the
     Company and excess servicing is capitalized  monthly and adjusted
     quarterly based on actual payments  received on the sold loans.

                 Proceeds from sales of OREO were $7,000 in 1994 and
     $15,241 in 1993.   Loans associated with these sales were $2,275

     exceed 90% of the sale price and no unguaranteed commercial,
     commercial real estate or condominium loan exceed 80% of the sale
     price.  During 1994 loans of $686 were granted at UB at percentages of
     sales price which exceeded the Company's policy.  None of these loans
     exceed  95% of the OREO sales price.

     9.   Fair Market Value of Financial Instruments
                 
     Cash and Cash Equivalents
     
                      Cash and cash equivalents had a carrying value of
     $73,107 and $61,878 at December 31, 1994 and 1993, respectively.  Due
     to their short term and very liquid nature the  carrying value is
     considered to also represent the fair market value of these balances.     
     
     Securities
     
        Securities are classified as available for sale and are carried      
     at fair market value based on quoted market prices or dealer quotes. 
     Securities available for sale had a total  fair market value of
     $173,865 and $184,400 at December 31, 1994 and 1993, respectively. 
     This compares to  amortized cost values of $188,416 at December 31,
     1994 and $183,089 at December 31, 1993.
     
     Loans
     
                      At December 31, 1994 and 1993 total loans, net of    
     allowance for loan losses, had a carrying value of  $895,267 and
     $854,626, respectively.  The fair value of these loans was $901,372
     and $871,533, respectively.  For certain homogeneous categories of
     loans, such as some  residential mortgages, credit card receivables
     and other   consumer loans, fair value is estimated using the quoted
     market prices for securities backed by similar loans, adjusted for
     differences in loan characteristics.  The fair value of other types of
     loans is estimated by  discounting the future cash flows using the
     current rates at  which similar loans would be made to borrowers with     
     similar credit ratings and for the same remaining maturities.             
     
     Deposits
     
                      At December 31, 1994 and 1993 total deposits had
     carrying values of $1,012,869  and $967,582 and fair values of
     $1,010,215 and $970,782, respectively.  The fair value of demand
     deposits, savings accounts, and certain money market deposits is the
     amount payable on demand at the  reporting  date.  The fair value of
     fixed maturity certificates of deposits is estimated using the rates
     currently  offered for deposits of similar remaining maturities.
     
     Other Borrowings
     
                      Total other borrowings had carrying values of $93,888
     and $92,053 at December 31, 1994 and 1993, respectively.  These are
     also reasonable estimates of fair market value.
     
     Off-Balance Sheet Financial Instruments
     
                      The Company's off-balance sheet exposure is primarily
     in the  form  of commitments to extend credit and standby letters of
     credit.  The carrying amount of these arrangements  represents
     accruals or deferred income (fees) arising from those unrecognized
     financial instruments.  Such amounts are minimal and approximate fair
     value.  
                 
     10. Commitments and Contingencies and Financial Instruments with
         Off-Balance Sheet Risk
                 
                  Leases -- The following is a schedule by years of future    
     minimum rental payments required under operating leases for premises
     and data processing equipment that have  initial or remaining
     noncancelable lease terms in excess of one year as of December 31,
     1994.  Certain operating leases contain various options to renew.
                 Year Ending December 31:
                 1995                                    $ 589     
                 1996                                      458     
                 1997                                      345     
                 1998                                      285     
                 1999                                      245     
                 Later Years                             2,156

                                                         =====
                  Operating expenses include approximately $988, $1,228,
     and $1,481 in 1994, 1993 and 1992, respectively, for rentals of
     premises and equipment used for banking purposes.
                 
     Derivative Financial Instruments
                 
                  Transactions involving derivative financial instruments
     during the fiscal years 1994, 1993 and 1992 were immaterial.
                 
     Financial Instruments With Off-Balance Sheet Risk
                 
                  The Company is party to financial instruments with
     off-balance sheet risk in the normal course of business to meet the
     financing needs of its customers.  These financial instruments include
     commitments to extend credit and standby letters of credit.  Those
     instruments involve, to  varying  degrees, elements of credit and
     interest rate risk in excess of the amount recognized in the
     consolidated  statements of financial condition.  The contract           
     amounts of those instruments reflect the extent of involvement the      
     Company has in particular classes of financial instruments.
                 
                  The Company's exposure to credit loss in the event of      
     nonperformance  by the counterparty to the financial instrument for
     commitments to extend credit and standby letters of credit is
     represented by the contractual amount  of those instruments.  The
     Banks use the same credit policies in  making commitments and
     conditional obligations as they do for on-balance sheet instruments.
                 
                  Commitments to extend credit are agreements to lend to a    
     customer  as long as there is no violation of any  condition
     established in the contract.  Commitments generally have fixed
     expiration dates or other termination clauses and may require payment
     of a fee.  Since many of the commitments are expected to expire
     without being drawn  upon, the total commitment amounts do not
     necessarily represent   future cash requirements.  Total commitments
     to extend credit at December 31, 1994 were as follows:

                      Home equity lines             $52,877         
                      Credit card lines              71,730      
                      Commercial real estate         13,229      
                      Other unused commitments       86,266      
                 
                  The Company evaluates each customer's credit-worthiness
     on a  case-by-case basis.  The amount of collateral obtained if deemed
     necessary upon extension of credit is based  on management's credit
     evaluation of the counterparty.  Collateral held varies but may
     include certificates of deposit, accounts receivable, inventory,         
     property, plant and equipment, residential real estate and    
     income-producing commercial properties.
                 
                  Standby letters of credit are conditional commitments
     issued by the Company to guarantee the performance of a customer to a
     third party.  Those guarantees are primarily issued  to support public
     and private borrowing  arrangements, including commercial paper, bond
     financing and similar  transactions.  The credit risk involved in        
     issuing letters of credit is essentially the same as that involved      
     in extending loan facilities to customers.  The collateral varies but
     may include certificates of deposit, accounts receivable, inventory,
     property, plant and  equipment and residential real estate for those
     commitments for which  collateral is deemed necessary.
                 
                  As of December 31, 1994, the Company had outstanding    
     commitments  for the following:  financial standby letters of credit -
     $5,962, performance standby letters of  credit - $4,215 and commercial
     and similar letters of credit - $6,481.
                 
                  Non-Interest Bearing Deposits and Cash -- The Company is    
     required  by the Federal Reserve Bank to maintain a  portion of
     deposits as a cash reserve.  The Company must  maintain cash balances
     on hand or at the Federal Reserve  Bank equal to its reserve
     requirement.  At December 31, 1994 the Company's reserve requirement
     of $13,872 was met  with cash on hand and deposits at the Federal
     Reserve Bank.
                 
                  The Company is also involved in litigation arising in the    
     normal course of business.  The Company does not  anticipate that any
     of these matters will result in the payment by the  Company of
     damages, that in the aggregate,  would be material in relation to the
     consolidated results of operations or financial position of the
     Company.
                 
     11. Income Taxes
                 
                  As discussed in Note 1, the Company adopted the
     provisions of  SFAS No. 109 as of the fourth quarter of 1992.  The
     change had no material effect on reported net income for1992 or for
     any of the first three quarters of 1992.
                 
                  The provisions for income tax expense (benefit) included
     in the statements of income are as follows:

                  No valuation allowance is required as there is sufficient    
     taxable income in the carry back period and through future operating
     results to be able to fully realize the deferred tax asset.
                 
                  The provision for income taxes is less than the amount

     12. Employee Benefit Plans
                 
                  The Company's two subsidiaries each have separate defined    
     benefit pension plans.
                 
     Vermont National Bank
                 
                  VNB has a trusteed non-contributory defined benefit
     pension plan  covering substantially all of its  employees.  The
     benefits are based on years of service and the employee's final
     compensation.  The Company's  funding policy is to contribute annually
     an amount that can be  deducted for federal income tax purposes using
     a  different actuarial cost method and different assumptions from    
     those used for financial reporting.

     United Bank
                 
                 UB has a non-contributory defined benefit plan providing    
     pension benefits through membership in the Savings Banks Employees
     Retirement Association ("SBERA") covering  substantially  all  of its
     employees meeting certain requirements  as to age and length of
     service.  The plan provides a monthly  benefit upon retirement based
     on compensation during the highest paid consecutive three years of
     employment during the last ten years of credited service.  It is the      
     Company's policy to fund annually an amount equal to the lesser of      
     the actuarially determined normal cost or the  amount allowed by the
     Internal Revenue Code Section 412 Full Funding  Limitations.  All plan
     assets are part of a  single pooled fund made up of all participated
     SBERA members  which  are managed by the SBERA Trustees.

                  The Company also has a Profit-Sharing Plan covering    
     substantially all  employees.  A portion of the annual contribution by
     the Company is at the discretion of the Board of Directors.  The
     discretionary contribution for 1994 was approximately $250 and none
     was made for 1993 or 1992.  The Plan also includes a 25% Company match
     of employee contributions to a 401k portion of the Plan.  This    
     Plan feature was added in 1993 and the associated  expense was $118
     for 1994 and $114 for 1993.
                 
                  The Company also has an Employee Stock Purchase Plan
     covering  substantially all employees.  The Plan allows  the purchase
     of common stock at a ten percent discount from the  then  current fair
     market value, without payment of any brokerage commission or service
     charge.
                 
                  The Company sponsors defined benefit postretirement
     medical and  life insurance plans that cover all of its full time
     employees and participating retirees.  Eligible employees who retire
     and who have attained age 65 with at least 10 years of service may
     elect coverage.  Spouses of eligible retirees are required to
     contribute 100% of the cost of any medical coverage they elect.  A
     closed group of certain retirees and their spouses who elected to         
     retire under a special incentive program receive additional    
     medical benefits.  The plans are not funded.  Effective January 1,
     1993 the Company adopted SFAS No. 106, "Employers' Accounting for
     Postretirement Benefits Other Than Pensions".

</TABLE>
              For measurement purposes, an 8% annual rate of increase in
     the  per capita net employer share of covered  health care benefits
     was assumed for 1994.  The rate was assumed to remain at that level
     thereafter, but the impact of medical inflation eventually diminishes
     because of the $10  per capita lifetime limit on medical benefits and
     the likelihood that most current retirees and all future retirees    
     will reach that cap.  The medical trend rate  assumption, therefore,
     merely affects the timing of the distribution of the $10 in benefits
     to each participant, and so has a relatively small effect on the
     amounts reported.  To illustrate, increasing the assumed health care       
     cost trend rate by one percentage point for all future years  would      
     increase the accumulated postretirement benefit  obligation at
     December 31, 1994, as well as the total of the  service cost and
     interest cost components of net  periodic postretirement cost for 1994
     by less than 2%.  The weighted  average discount rate used in
     determining the accumulated postretirement benefit obligation was 8.5%
     in 1994 and 7.0% in 1993.  As the plan is unfunded, no  assumption was
     needed as to the long term rate of return on assets.
                 
     13. Stockholders' Equity
                 
                  The Company had certain common stock equivalents
     outstanding from  1992 through 1994.  As a result, earnings per share
     is based on the primary and fully diluted shares outstanding    
     during the respective periods shown in the table below:

                  The per share amounts of cash dividends paid on an
     equivalent  share  basis were $0.54 for 1994, $0.24 for  1993 and
     $0.08 for 1992.  At December 31, 1994, the Banks had  available
     $23,795 for payment of dividends to the Company, under regulatory
     guidelines.
                 
                  At December 31, 1994, there were 51,960 and 70,599 shares
     of common stock reserved for issuance pursuant to the Company's
     Dividend Reinvestment and Stock Purchase Plan and pursuant to the
     Company's Employee Stock Purchase Plan, respectively.
                 
                 Options Agreements - On April 20, 1987, stockholders
     approved a  non-qualified stock option plan for 105,000 shares           
     of the Company's common stock and on April 17, 1990 stockholders      
     approved a non-qualified stock option plan for 80,000 shares of the
     Company's common stock.  In October, 1993  the 65,100 and 40,000
     options that were then  outstanding expired unexercised for these
     respective plans.  On  October 13, 1993 new options to purchase 36,000
     and 12,000 shares, respectively, were granted under these plans at    
     an option price of $19.00 per share and are exercisable for a five
     year period.  None have been exercised to date.  On August 31, 1994
     stockholders approved  the Vermont Financial Services Corp. 1994 Stock
     Option Plan  which  reserves 225,000 common shares to be issued in        
     the form of stock options.  To date 48,000 have been issued at an      
     exercise price of $19.00 per share and 6,500 have  been issued at an
     exercise price of $20.25 per share.  None  have  been  exercised          
     
                  The Company also continues to maintain a stock option
     plan  originally approved November 6, 1986 by the Stockholders of West
     Mass Bankshares which authorizes the issuance  of up to 138,000 common
     shares.  To date 126,960 shares have been issued at an exercise price
     of $7.50 per share and  6,900 shares have been issued at an exercise       
     price of $10.25 per share.  The following table summarizes activity

      Statement of Management Responsibility
                 
                  The management of Vermont Financial Services Corp. is    
     responsible  for the accuracy and content of the financial statements
     and other financial information in this annual report.  The financial
     statements have been  prepared in conformity with generally accepted
     accounting  principals applied on a consistent basis in all material      
     respects, and data include amounts based upon management's judgement      
     where appropriate.
                 
                  The accounting systems which record, summarize and report    
     financial data are supported by a system of internal controls which is
     augmented by written policies, internal audits and staff training
     programs.  The Audit Committee of the Board of Directors, which is
     made up solely of outside directors who are not employees of the           
     Company, reviews the activities of the internal audit function and      
     meets regularly with representatives of Coopers & Lybrand, the
     Company's independent auditors.  Coopers & Lybrand  has been appointed
     by the Board of Directors to conduct an independent audit and to
     express an opinion as to the fairness of the presentation of the
     consolidated financial statements of Vermont Financial Services Corp.

                  We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance

     December 31, 1994, and the related consolidated statements of income,
     changes in stockholders' equity and cash flow for the year then ended. 
     These financial statements are the responsibility of the Company's       
     management.  Our responsibility is to express an opinion on  these      
     financial statements based on our audit.
                 
                  We conducted our audit in accordance with generally
     accepted auditing  standards.  Those standards require  that we plan
     and perform the audit to obtain reasonable  assurance  about whether
     the financial statements are free of material misstatement.  An audit
     includes examining, on a  test basis, evidence supporting the amounts
     and disclosures in the financial statements.  An audit also  includes      
     assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates
     made by management, as well as evaluating the  overall financial
     statement presentation.  We  believe that our audit provides a
     reasonable basis for our opinion.
                 
                  In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements
     referred to above present fairly, in all material  respects, the
     consolidated financial position of Vermont  Financial Services Corp.
     and subsidiaries as of December 31, 1994, and the results of their
     operations and their cash flow for the year then ended, in conformity
     with  generally accepted accounting principles.
                 
               We previously audited and reported on the consolidated
     balance sheet as of December 31, 1993 and the related consolidated
     statements of income, changes in stockholders' equity and cash flow of
     Vermont Financial Services Corp. and subsidiary for each of the two
     years in the period ended December 31, 1993, prior to their           
     restatement for the June 14, 1994 pooling of interests with West      
     Mass  Bankshares, Inc.  The contribution of Vermont Financial Services
     Corp. and subsidiary to total assets, net  interest income and net
     income represented  approximately 81%, 82% and 74%, respectively for
     1993 and 81%, 82% and 66%, respectively for 1992, of the respective
     restated totals.  Separate financial statements of  West  Mass
     Bankshares, Inc. were audited and reported on separately by other
     auditors.  We also have applied procedures to  the combination of the
     accompanying  consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 1993 and
     the related consolidated statements of income, changes in       
     stockholders' equity and cash flow for each of the two years in    
     the period ended December 31, 1993, after  restatement for the June
     14, 1994 pooling of interests; in our  opinion, such consolidated
     statements have been properly combined on the basis described in Note
     2 to the consolidated  financial statements.
                 
                  As described in Notes 1 and 12 to the consolidated
     financial statements, the Company changed its method of accounting for
     certain investments in debt and equity  securities and accounting for
     postretirement benefits other than pensions in 1993.
                 
                  As discussed in Notes 1 and 11 to the consolidated
     financial statements, the Company changed its method of accounting for
     income taxes in 1992.

     Deferred Compensation Agreements
                 
                      VNB  has entered into Executive Deferred Compensation   
     Agreements  with certain  officers,  including  Mr. Hashagen  and the
     other executive officers in the  group  referred to in the above
     table.   The agreements provide for monthly  payments for a ten-year 
     period  from  retirement  after age 60 but before  age 65, and  for  a
     fifteen-year  period from retirement after age 65,  subject to certain 
     conditions.  The  conditions include the requirements that the officer
     refrain  from  competitive activities, be available for certain
     advisory and consulting services  subsequent to retirement and
     continue in the employment of VNB until retirement.   The agreements      
     also  provide  for  payments upon disability prior to retirement and       
     payments  to  beneficiaries of the officers under certain
     circumstances.  Mr. Hashagen's agreement provides  for payments in the
     amount of $1,944.44 per month,  and the  agreements of Messrs. Madden,
     Soucy and Fenn provide for payments of  $1,388.89 per  month.  Vermont     
     National  Bank has purchased life insurance policies on the lives of      
     these officers which,  in  effect,  will  provide the funds to make
     payments to reimburse VNB  for payments made under the agreements.
                 
                      Mr.  Lemay  is covered under a Supplemental Executive   
     Retirement Plan  (SERP) which  is designed to augment his retirement
     benefit from UB's pension plan and his social  security  benefit  so
     that his aggregate annual retirement  benefit  will approximate 70% of
     his highest 3-year average salary prior to retirement.  Under the        
     terms  of  his  SERP,  it is anticipated that Mr.  Lemay will       
     receive  an  annual  supplemental  retirement  benefit  of  $64,378 at
     age  65.   UB  has  purchased  a  split-dollar life insurance policy
     which will provide a benefit this Mr. Lemay.
                 
     Management Continuity Agreements
                 
                 The  Company  and VNB have entered into agreements with    
     VNB's six  executive   officers, Messrs. Hashagen, Madden, Soucy,
     Fenn, Dunham and George  which provide for the  payment  of certain
     severance benefits if such officer's  employment  with  the           
     Company  or VNB is terminated within thirty-six months after a      
     change of control of the Company or VNB.   The agreements provide for
     severance payments to Mr. Hashagen equal to 250% of his base salary
     upon termination after a change of control and for  payments  to each
     of the other executive officers equal to 200% of  his  base  salary       
     upon termination after a change of control as defined in the  
     agreements.
                 
                      The management continuity agreements do not provide
     for  severance benefits in instances where termination is due to
     death, disability or retirement.  Further, no benefits  are payable in
     instances of termination for cause, or after a change  of control  if
     the officer voluntarily terminates his employment with both the
     Company and  VNB,  unless  such  termination  is for a "good reason"     
     as  defined  in  the agreements.
                 
                      Severance  benefits payable in the event of a
     qualifying termination after  a change  of control are to be paid in
     equal consecutive biweekly installments.   If severance  payments due
     in the event of termination after a change  of control  were  payable
     to each of the executive officers on the date of this filing, the
     aggregate amount of such severance payments would be $1,626,000. 
     These severance payments are subject  to  up to a 50% reduction if the
     officer works for or participates in  the management,  operation or
     control of a commercial or savings bank, or bank holding company, 
     which  does  business in Vermont,  unless such officer's      
     activities  are  substantially  outside  Vermont.   Additionally,  the
     officer will be entitled  to  continuation of life, disability,
     accident and health insurance  benefits and a cash adjustment  to 
     compensate the executive for the market value of any stock  options      
     under  the Company's Officers'  or Directors'  Non-Qualified Stock      
     Option Plans  in  excess of their exercise price.
                 
                      The  agreements contain each officer's undertaking to    
     remain in  the employ of the Company and VNB if a potential change of
     control occurs until the earlier of six  months,  retirement  (at
     normal age),  disability or the occurrence  of a change  of           
     control.
                 
                      Similar  agreements  have been executed by certain    
     employees of VNB  and  the  Company  which  provide  for severance
     payments ranging from 100% to  150%  of  the  employee's base salary
     upon termination after a change in control.
                 
                      The  Company  and  UB have entered into agreements
     with UB's  five  executive officers,  Messrs. Lemay, Cole, Neill,
     Phillips and Noska.   It was agreed that Mr. Lemay would be President
     and Chief Executive Officer of UB until December 31, 1994. Thereafter, 
     the Company has agreed that Mr. Lemay would continue as Chairman and a     
     Director of UB until December 31, 1997.  Mr. Lemay's contract also      
     provides that he will  serve as a consultant to the Company from
     December 31, 1994 through December 31, 1997.  Mr. Lemay's compensation
     for consulting services after December 31, 1994 is to be $25,000 per
     year.   Mr. Lemay is also on the Company's  Board of Directors.            
     Currently,  each  director of the Company who is not an officer of      
     the Company or a subsidiary receives an annual retainer of $4,800 and, 
     in addition, a $400 fee for each  regular monthly Board meeting
     attended as well as a $300 fee for each meeting of a committee of the
     Board attended.  Mr. Lemay did not receive any such director's           
     fees while serving as an operating officer of UB.  
                 
                      Additionally,  the  Company  and  UB entered into    
     agreements to  employ  the following UB officers:  Kenneth R. Cole as
     Senior Vice President & Treasurer of UB; James Neill as Senior Vice
     President of UB;  and Robert W. Phillips and Matthew W. Noska as Vice
     Presidents of UB.   Under these agreements, Mr. Cole was to receive a      
     base salary of $82,500,  Mr.  Neill a base salary of $76,300, Mr.       
     Phillips a base salary  of $59,700 and Mr.  Noska a base salary of
     $52,000, all subject to  annual increases.  Each agreement is to
     expire May, 1997, except that  Mr. Noska's agreement is to expire May, 
     1995.   On January 1, 1995, Mr.  Cole became President and Chief           
     Executive Officer of UB at an annual salary of $110,000.
     
                      In addition to and as part of the foregoing
     agreements,  Messrs. Cole, Neill, Phillips  and Noska have entered
     management continuity agreements  which are similar in  form  to 
     agreements currently in force between the Company  and  VNB  and 
     their senior  officers.   Each  agreement's  term  ends on  January     
     31, 1995  and  is automatically renewable thereafter unless the
     Company and UB elect not to renew it. Under the management continuity
     agreements, the above officers would  be entitled to  the  following
     severance payments if terminated under certain circumstances after a      
     change of control of the Company or UB:  Messrs. Cole, Phillips    
     and Neill - 200% of base salary at the time of termination; Mr. Noska
     - 100% of base salary at the time of termination.
                 
                      The management continuity agreements define a "change
     of control"  as (i) the acquisition  by  a  person  or group of 25% of
     the combined voting  power  of  the Company's or UB's then outstanding
     securities; (ii) during any two-year period those persons,  who at the
     beginning of such period were members of the Company's or UB's Board 
     of  Directors and any new director whose election was approved by  at 
     least two-thirds  of the directors then still in office who either    
     were directors at  the beginning of such period or whose election or
     nomination was previously so approved, cease  to  constitute a
     majority of such board;  or (iii) the stockholders  of  the Company 
     or  UB approve a merger or consolidation of the Company or UB      
     which  would   result  in such stockholders holding less than 70% of
     the combined voting power  of the  surviving entity immediately
     thereafter,  or if such stockholders approve  the sale of all or
     substantially all of the assets of the Company or UB.
                 
                      The management continuity agreements do not provide
     for severance benefits in instances where termination is due to death,
     disability or retirement.  Further, no  benefits  are  payable in
     instances of termination for cause,  defined as  (i)  the willful and
     continued failure of the officer to perform his duties and (ii)
     willful conduct materially injurious to the Company or UB.
                 
     Profit-Sharing Plan
                 
                      Each employee of VNB and UB, including executive
     officers, becomes eligible to participate  in the Company's
     Profit-Sharing Plan on January 1 of the Plan year  in  which  he  or
     she completes one full year of continuous service of 1,000  hours  or      
     more.   Upon completion of three years of continuous service, a      
     participant becomes 30% vested, increasing to 40% after four years,
     60% after five years, 80% after six  years,  and  fully  vested after
     seven years.   Vested participants may  elect  to  receive, in cash,
     up to 50% of their annual allocation of the  Company's contribution      
     to the Profit-Sharing Plan.  Vested amounts not so received in    
     cash are distributed to  participants upon their retirement or earlier 
     upon termination of  employment. During  1994,  the Company made a
     contribution of approximately $250,000  to  the Profit-Sharing Plan.
                 
     Retirement Plan
                 
                      The  VNB  Retirement Plan covers substantially all    
     eligible employees of  the  Bank, including officers, and provides for
     payment of retirement benefits generally based  upon  an employee's
     years of credited service with the Bank and his  or  her salary 
     level,  reduced by a portion of the Social Security benefits  to which
     it is  estimated the employee will be entitled.
                 
                      The  following table represents estimated annual
     benefits upon retirement  at age  65 to employees at specified salary
     levels (based upon the average annual rate of salary during the
     highest five years within the final ten years of employment) at           
     stated  years of service with the Bank.   The amounts shown are      
     after deduction  of estimates  for  Social Security reductions based
     on the Social Security law  as  of January 1, 1995.

                 *    Under  current regulations of the Internal Revenue
     Code, the maximum  annual benefit  payable  from a defined benefit
     plan during 1995 is $120,000 payable as  a life  annuity  for 
     retirements  at age  65.   In  addition, the  maximum  annual          
     compensation may not exceed $150,000.  The amounts shown above in

                      The  description  of the Retirement Plan in this
     Proxy Statement is  intended solely  to provide stockholders of the
     Company with general information  concerning  the  Plan as it relates
     to management remuneration.   Under no  circumstances should           
     the description be construed as indicative of the rights of any      
     particular employee, or  as  conferring any right upon any employee, 
     which rights will in all cases  be determined by the appropriate legal
     documents governing the Plan.
                 
                      UB  provides a retirement plan for all eligible
     employees through the Savings  Bank  Employees Retirement Association
     ("SBERA"),  an  unincorporated association of  savings  banks 
     operating  within Massachusetts and other  organizations  providing       
     services to or for savings banks SBERA's sole purpose is to enable      
     the  participating employers to provide pensions and other benefits
     for their employees.
                 
                      Each  UB  employee age 21 or older who has completed
     at least 1,000 hours  of service  in  the  last  12 month period
     beginning with  such  employee's  date  of employment becomes a
     participant of the retirement plan.  All participants are fully           
     vested when they have been credited with three (3) years of

                      The retirement plan is a qualified defined benefit
     plan which does not require an  employee  to make any contributions to
     become a participant and earn  benefits  under  the  Plan.   The
     benefits provide for a pension equal to 1.25%  of  Average
     Compensation  (the average of the three highest consecutive years of       
     Compensation)  for each year of service up to 25 years, plus .6% of    
     compensation above the Covered Compensation (defined below) for each
     year of service up to 25 years.  For example, under  the  above
     benefit formula,  a Participant attaining age 65 in 1995 with  25         
     years of service,  will be entitled to a benefit equal to 31.25%      
     (1.25% x 25 years) of Average Compensation plus 15% (.6% x 25 years)
     of the difference (if any) between  the  participant's  Average 
     Compensation  and  the  Covered  Compensation  for  a participant 
     turning age 65 in 1994 which is $24,312.   Covered Compensation is the    
     average  of  the 35 years of Social Security taxable wages up to and      
     including  the year  in  which  a Participant reaches Social  Security
     retirement age.   Normal  retirement age under the plan is 65;  a
     reduced early  retirement benefit is payable from age 50 to 65 under
     certain conditions.   On December 31, 1994, the latest date           
     for which retirement plan information is available, the present      
     value of accumulated benefits  was  fully funded by the market value
     of plan assets.  The Bank made  no  contribution to the Pension Plan
     during 1994:
                 
                      The following table illustrates annual pension
     benefits for retirement at age 65  under  the  most advantageous plan
     provisions available for various  levels  of compensation  and years
     of service.   The figures in this table are based upon  the assumption
     that the plan continues in its present form and certain other
     assumptions regarding compensation trends and social security.

     Item 13 - Certain Relationships and Related Transactions
                 
                      Some  directors and officers of VNB,  UB and the
     Company and their associates were  customers  of  and had transactions
     with the Banks and the Company  in  the ordinary course of business
     during 1994.  Additional transactions may be expected to take place in
     the ordinary course of business in the future.  Some of the Company's     
     directors  are directors,  officers,  trustees,  or principal      
     security holders  of corporations or other organizations which were
     customers of or had transactions with  the Banks in the ordinary
     course of business during 1994.  All outstanding loans and         
     commitments  included  in  such transactions were made in the      
     ordinary  course  of business on substantially the same terms, 
     including interest rates and collateral, as  those prevailing at the
     time for comparable transactions with other persons and  did  not 
     involve  more than the normal risk of collectibility nor       
     present  other unfavorable features.
                 
                      In addition to banking and financial transactions, 
     the Banks and the Company have  had  other  transactions with,  or
     used products  or  services  of,  various  organizations  of  which
     directors of the Company are directors or  officers.   The amounts 
     involved have in no case been material in relation to  the business of 
     the Banks  or  the  Company,  and it is believed that they have not    
     been material  in relation  to  the  business  of such other
     organizations  or to  the individuals  concerned.  It is expected that
     the Banks and the Company will continue to have similar transactions
     with,  and use products or services of,  such organizations in
