                                     PART I
 
ITEM 1:    BUSINESS
THE HEALTH CARE INDUSTRY
 
    Annual  health care  expenditures in the  United States have  grown from $27
billion in  1960,  which represented  approximately  5% of  the  gross  domestic
product,  to $938  billion in 1994,  which represented approximately  14% of the
gross domestic product. As a  consequence, employers, insurers and  governmental
authorities  have been increasingly focusing on alternative health care delivery
systems such as  health maintenance organizations  ("HMOs") that provide  better
controls  on rising  costs without  sacrificing quality.  HMO enrollment  in the
United States has increased from approximately three million members in 1970  to
approximately 51 million at January 1, 1995, served by 562 HMOs.
 
    The goals of HMOs are to provide their members with access to quality health
care,  while employing  a business strategy  and management  systems designed to
encourage more cost-effective  use of  health care delivery  systems. Such  cost
containment  strategies include providing  access to primary  physician care and
other services on  a fixed,  prepaid basis, monitoring  hospital admissions  and
length of stay, using a system of specialist referrals, using non-hospital based
medical   services,  and  emphasizing  preventive   care.  To  accomplish  these
objectives, several  basic  HMO  models have  evolved:  staff,  group,  network,
individual practice, and individual practice association. The key distinguishing
feature  of each model is the relationship between the HMO and the participating
physicians. Under  the staff  model, the  HMO employs  the physicians  and  uses
capital  to provide  the facilities  in which  the physicians  see patients. The
physicians receive a salary and  often a bonus based  on the performance of  the
HMO.  Under the  group model, the  HMO contracts with  one large multi-specialty
medical group practice which typically receives a monthly fixed fee for each HMO
member (capitation), regardless of the medical services provided to each member.
The network  model  is predicated  on  an HMO  contracting  with more  than  one
physician  group  to  provide  services  on  a  capitated  fee  basis.  Under an
individual practice model, the HMO contracts with independent physicians who are
broadly dispersed throughout a community and who care for patients in their  own
offices.  The  individual practice  association (IPA)  model  is similar  to the
individual practice model except an IPA model HMO contracts with an organization
(the IPA) that in turn contracts with the physicians. The HMOs operated by  U.S.
Healthcare,  Inc. (the "Company") most closely adhere to the individual practice
model. Unless the context otherwise requires, references to the Company  include
its subsidiaries.
 
THE COMPANY'S MANAGED HEALTH CARE DELIVERY SYSTEM
 
    The Company provides comprehensive managed health care services through HMOs
it   owns  and  operates  in  Pennsylvania,  New  Jersey,  New  York,  Delaware,
Connecticut, Massachusetts, New  Hampshire, Maryland,  Georgia, Virginia,  Rhode
Island, North Carolina, South Carolina and the District of Columbia.
 
    The services of the Company's HMOs are marketed primarily to employer groups
and  are  provided  through  networks  of  independent  health  care  providers,
including  selected  primary  care  physicians  who  coordinate  each   person's
individual  medical care. In  addition to comprehensive  primary physician care,
specialist care and hospital services,  the Company makes available home  health
care and other outpatient services as well as optional prescription drug, vision
care  and  dental plans.  The Company  contracts  with independent  primary care
physicians who are reimbursed under prospective payment arrangements in order to
remove traditional barriers to care. The Company encourages preventive care  and
the  use  of  alternative  medical delivery  services,  and  provides  access to
comprehensive traditional health care services.
 
    The Company  contracts with  providers  to participate  in its  HMO  service
network  as it expands into new geographic areas or as it considers necessary to
serve its HMO membership. At December 31, 1995, the HMO service network included
approximately 13,400 primary care physicians, 40,600 specialists, 441  hospitals
and 7,000 pharmacies.

THE COMPANY'S HEALTH PLANS
 
    The  Company's health  plans consist of  HMO plans  and indemnity-type plans
offered  both  on   a  fully-insured   and  an   employer-funded  basis.   Under
fully-insured health plans, the Company charges a premium and bears the risk for
medical  costs incurred. Under employer-funded health plans, the Company charges
a fee for providing administrative services and the employer bears substantially
all risk for  medical costs incurred.  The Company's health  plans served  about
2,442,000  members as of December 31, 1995, an increase of 475,000 or 24.1% from
approximately 1,967,000 at December 31,  1994. The following tables show  health
plan  membership at December 31, 1995 and the increase in membership compared to
December 31, 1994 by plan type and by state:

</TABLE>
 
    Under  fully-insured  HMO  plans,  members  receive  comprehensive   medical
coverage  in exchange for a fixed monthly  premium. The Company offers HMO plans
with minimum  out-of-pocket member  expense (copayments)  and plans  with  lower
premium rates and higher member copayments. When an individual enrolls in one of
the  Company's HMOs, he or  she selects a primary  care physician from among the
physicians who have contracted with the Company. The primary care physicians are
family practitioners,  general practitioners,  internists or  pediatricians  who
provide  necessary  preventive  and  primary  medical  care  and  are  generally
responsible for making referrals to specialists. Except in
 
                                       3
<PAGE>
emergency situations,  hospital  care generally  requires  a referral  from  the
member's primary care physician and takes place in hospitals that have contracts
to serve the HMOs' members for an agreed compensation.
 
    Commercial  members  join  the  Company's  HMOs  generally  through employer
groups. See "Marketing" below.  In many instances,  employers offer employees  a
choice of managed care or indemnity coverage. Employees may select their desired
health  coverage during  a designated period  (usually one  month annually). New
employees make their selections at  the time of employment. Employers  generally
pay  all or  part of the  monthly premiums  and make payroll  deductions for any
portion of the premium not provided as an employee benefit.
 
    In 1994,  the Company  introduced its  Quality Point-of-Service-TM-  Program
(QPOS-TM-),  a joint offering  of the Company's  HMO and insurance subsidiaries.
Members can utilize comprehensive  HMO benefits through participating  providers
or  go directly, without  a referral, to  any provider they  choose, subject to,
among other things, certain deductibles and coinsurance. Membership in QPOS  was
about  325,000 at December  31, 1995, an  increase of 292,000  from December 31,
1994. These members  are classified  as U.S.  Healthcare-insured commercial  HMO
members in the preceding table.
 
    In  New York and New Jersey,  the Company makes fully-insured commercial HMO
coverage available on a direct-pay basis to individual subscribers. At  December
31, 1995, about 11,000 members were enrolled in these plans.
 
    The  Company has annual contracts with the federal government in most of the
states in which the Company operates HMOs to provide fully-insured HMO  coverage
to  Medicare beneficiaries  who choose to  receive their health  care through an
HMO. Under these contracts, the federal government agrees to pay the Company  at
a  rate equal  to 95% of  the estimated  average cost for  services per Medicare
beneficiary that would have been incurred for treatment of such beneficiaries in
the same geographic areas. Amounts payable under these contracts are subject  to
periodic  unilateral revision by the federal government. In addition to payments
from the federal government, some of the Company's Medicare HMO plans require  a
small premium to be paid by the member. At December 31, 1995, the Company served
about 108,000 Medicare beneficiaries.
 
    The  Company  has contracts  with certain  state and  local agencies  in New
Jersey, New York and  Pennsylvania to provide  fully-insured medical and  health
benefits  to persons eligible for Medicaid benefits in certain counties in those
states. The  Company's contracts  are for  periods  of one  to three  years.  At
December  31, 1995,  about 81,000  Medicaid beneficiaries  were enrolled  in the
Company's HMO plans. The Company's contract  to provide health care coverage  to
Medicaid  beneficiaries in Massachusetts terminated effective December 31, 1995.
As of that date, the Company served about 200 Medicaid members in Massachusetts.
 
    The Company  offers the  Children's Health  Insurance Program  (CHIP)  under
contract  with  the  Commonwealth  of  Pennsylvania.  CHIP  is  a  fully-insured
comprehensive health care plan for children  of low-income families who are  not
covered  by Medicaid  or other  health insurance.  The Company  also offers CHIP
Plus, a program  whereby the  Company pays  all or a  part of  the premiums  for
certain  children ineligible  for fully  state-funded coverage.  At December 31,
1995, about 8,000 members were enrolled in these programs.
 
    The Company offers indemnity health insurance products to employers based in
the states in  which it operates  HMOs. At  December 31, 1995,  the Company  had
about 10,000 enrollees in its fully-insured indemnity plans.
 
COST CONTAINMENT
 
    The  Company has developed  contractual arrangements with  providers to help
control the high cost of medical services. These contractual arrangements  cover
the  majority of medical services. In the Company's managed health care delivery
system, the  primary  care  physician  plays an  important  role  in  practicing
preventive  medicine and acts on  behalf of the HMO  member to provide access to
 
                                       4
<PAGE>
specialist physicians, hospitals, and other health care providers. These primary
care physicians contract with  the Company to participate  in a system that  has
attracted  an increasing number of  people interested in cost-effective, quality
medical care;  to more  effectively  influence health  care planning;  to  enjoy
stable  and timely remuneration; and to  reduce bad debt experience, billing and
other   paperwork.   Participating   physicians   are   primarily    independent
practitioners  who  generally also  have  patients who  are  not members  of the
Company's HMOs.
 
    The Company generally  compensates HMO primary  care physicians pursuant  to
its  Quality Care  Compensation System  ("QCCS"). The  system employs  a monthly
capitation payment feature as well  as quality assessment, comprehensiveness  of
care,  utilization and  office status components.  These components  are used to
adjust the capitation payments to individual physician offices and to  determine
the amount of additional periodic payments.
 
    The  Company has capitated payment arrangements for mental health, substance
abuse,  diagnostic  laboratory,  radiology  and  diagnostic  imaging   services,
podiatric  treatment,  physical therapy  and  prescription drug  dispensing. The
Company has contracts with specialist physicians at specified rates per visit or
procedure.
 
    The Company has contracts  that provide for all-inclusive  per diem and  per
case hospitalization rates, and fixed rates for ambulatory surgery and emergency
room  services. The Company  compensates certain contracted  hospitals using the
Company's CapTainer-Registered  Trademark- compensation  methodology that  takes
into account the attainment of agreed upon quality and cost containment goals to
help determine the final compensation paid to the hospitals. Under the CapTainer
methodology,  hospitals are paid  certain fees based on  use of their facilities
but can  earn  financial incentives  based  on patient  satisfaction  and  other
performance measurements.
 
    The Company also has contractual arrangements with certain integrated health
delivery  systems under  which the  systems are  compensated on  a substantially
fixed prospective basis for medical services, including primary, specialist  and
hospital  care. At  December 31, 1995,  about 86,000 members  were enrolled with
primary care physicians who participate in such integrated delivery systems.
 
    In addition to its contractual arrangements, the Company uses other means to
deliver access to  quality care  in a cost-effective  manner. Company  employees
monitor  hospital cases and assist participating  physicians who wish to arrange
for medically  appropriate  but  less  costly  alternatives.  In  addition,  the
Company's  HMOs generally  require precertification  of elective  admissions and
monitor the length of hospital  stays. Participating physicians generally  admit
their  HMO  patients  to hospitals  using  referral procedures  that  direct the
hospital to the Company's patient management unit, which confirms the  patient's
membership  status while  obtaining pertinent  data. This  unit also coordinates
related activities, including the subsequent transition to the home  environment
and  home  care,  if  necessary.  Case  management  assistance  for  complex  or
"catastrophic" cases is provided by a special case unit.
 
    The Company generally provides participating primary care physicians with  a
monthly  report  of services  and  costs rendered  to  HMO members.  This report
contains cost and  utilization data,  including hospital  and specialist  costs,
which  enables  the  physician to  monitor  hospital and  specialist  costs. The
Company's information  systems  also enable  it  to monitor  enrollment,  member
eligibility, and the historical use and cost of various services.
 
OTHER PRODUCTS AND SERVICES
 
    The  Company offers  network-based workers compensation  case management and
network-based managed disability services. At December 31, 1995, the Company had
contracts to provide such services for approximately 250,000 employees, compared
to 224,000 employees at December 31, 1994.
 
    The Company  provides assistance  to multi-state  employers by  coordinating
their  relationships with other HMOs. Services include evaluation of the HMOs in
areas such as quality  of care, efficiency and  financial stability, as well  as
enrollment and billing management.
 
                                       5
<PAGE>
    The  Company offers quality and outcome measurement and improvement programs
and healthcare  data analysis  systems for  providers and  purchasers of  health
care.
 
    The  Company offers a number of supplemental benefit coverages to employers,
either as supplements to  HMO plans or as  stand-alone products. Such  coverages
include dental plans, prescription drug plans, vision plans, employee assistance
programs and wellness programs.
 
QUALITY ASSESSMENT
 
    The   Company  is  an   industry  leader  in   developing  and  implementing
comprehensive quality assessment programs.  The Company believes that  providing
access  to  demonstrably  high  quality health  care  services  is  an essential
ingredient for success.
 
    The Company's quality assessment program  begins with the initial  selection
of  primary care physicians. Those who wish to participate in the Company's HMOs
must satisfy an  extensive set  of criteria. These  criteria include  licensure,
hospital  admitting  privileges, demonstrated  proficiency,  written references,
patient access, office standards, after-hours coverage and many other factors.
 
    Participating   primary   care   physicians   are   recertified    annually.
Recertification  covers  many aspects  of patient  care,  an analysis  of member
grievances, the transfer and termination rate of HMO members from the  practice,
on-site  interviews, analysis of utilization patterns, extensive member surveys,
and drug prescription patterns.
 
    Committees,  each  composed  of  a  peer  group  of  participating   private
physicians,  review  primary care  physician  applicants and  participants being
recertified. These committees  recommend certification,  recertification or,  if
appropriate,  sanctions, which may include termination from participation in the
Company's HMOs. Regular reports of their  determinations are made to each  HMO's
Board of Directors.
 
    The  Company's  member  relations  department  deals  directly  with members
concerning their health  care benefits.  It also investigates  grievances. On  a
routine  basis, survey questionnaires are sent  to members regarding the quality
of care they  receive. Physician  committees and medical  directors also  review
issues related to the delivery of medical care.
 
    Each  participating  primary care  physician  is obligated  to  carry direct
medical malpractice liability insurance in an amount no less than the greater of
the minimum amount required in the state  in which the physician is licensed  or
the  Company's requirements. In addition, the Company carries contingent medical
malpractice professional liability insurance.
 
    The Company has developed  criteria and systems to  measure the quality  and
effectiveness  of health care services provided in a variety of settings ranging
from physicians' offices to hospitals. These systems are used by the Company  in
its quality assessment program.
 
MARKETING
 
    The  Company  employs  a  direct  sales  force  of  approximately  885 sales
representatives  and  marketing  management  personnel.  Marketing  efforts  are
supported  by an advertising program that includes television, radio, billboards
and print  media,  as well  as  extensive  market research  and  a  computerized
database.
 
    The  Company's 25 largest customers,  including the Federal Employees Health
Benefits  Plan,  in  the  aggregate  comprised  22%  of  the  fully-insured  HMO
membership  at December 31, 1995. For the year ended December 31, 1995, premiums
billed to the federal government for the Federal Employees Health Benefits  Plan
were  approximately 8% of  total premium revenue.  The Company's agreements with
employer groups are generally for a term of 12 months and are subject to  annual
renewal.
 
TRADEMARKS
 
    The  registered trademark U.S. Healthcare-Registered  Trademark- is owned by
the Company. The Company considers U.S. Healthcare-Registered Trademark- and its
other trademarks and  trade names important  in the operation  of its  business.
However,  the  business  of  the  Company is  not  dependent  on  any individual
trademark or trade name.

COMPETITION
 
    Competition in the  health care  industry has intensified  in recent  years,
primarily  due  to  more  aggressive  marketing,  a  proliferation  of competing
products from  new and  existing  competitors and  increased quality  and  price
sensitivity.  Employer  groups  have  increasingly  demanded  additional benefit
options,  including  HMOs,  point-of-service  products  and  preferred  provider
organizations   (PPOs).  In   addition,  some  larger   employers  have  adopted
self-funded health benefit plans, with  plan administration provided by a  third
party.  The Company competes  with Blue Cross and  Blue Shield plans, commercial
insurers and other HMOs. Some of these organizations have greater enrollment  or
financial  resources  than  the  Company.  Management  believes  that  the  most
significant   factors   which   distinguish    competing   health   plans    are
comprehensiveness of coverage, quality of care and service, cost (including both
premium and member out-of-pocket costs), product design, financial stability and
provider networks. The Company strives to be competitive in each of these areas.
The  ability of  the Company to  increase the  number of persons  covered by its
health plans  or  to  increase  premiums  is  affected  by  competition  in  any
particular  area  and the  desire and  ability of  employers to  self-fund their
health benefit  plans.  Competition may  also  affect the  availability  to  the
Company  of  the  services  of health  care  providers,  including  primary care
physicians and hospitals.
 
EMPLOYEES
 
    At December 31, 1995,  the Company had 4,980  full and part-time  employees.
The Company believes that its relationship with its employees is good.
 
GOVERNMENT REGULATION
 
    The  federal government and the states in which the Company conducts its HMO
and other businesses have adopted laws and regulations that govern the  business
activities  of the  Company to varying  degrees. These laws  and regulations may
restrict how the Company  conducts its businesses and  may result in  additional
burdens  and  costs to  the Company.  Areas  of governmental  regulation include
licensure, premium rates,  benefits, service area  expansion, quality  assurance
procedures,  plan design, eligibility requirements, provider contracts and rates
of payment, underwriting, financial arrangements, financial condition (including
reserves) and corporate governance. Laws and regulations governing the Company's
businesses are  subject  to  amendments and  changing  interpretations  in  each
jurisdiction.
 
    There  have been diverse legislative and  regulatory initiatives at both the
federal and state  levels to  address, among other  aspects of  the health  care
system,  increases in health  care costs and  the lack of  health coverage for a
significant segment of  the population.  Several bills have  been introduced  in
Congress  in recent years to reform the nation's health care system. These bills
include elements  such  as  prohibitions on  preexisting  condition  exclusions;
guaranteed  issue  and renewability  of health  insurance; revisions  to current
Medicare HMO laws which would have the effect of reducing Medicare HMO  premiums
payable  by the federal government; subsidies  for individuals who are uninsured
or underinsured;  mandates on  employers to  provide health  coverage for  their
employees;  medical  savings accounts;  minimum  or standardized  health benefit
packages; limitations  on  premium  rate increases  and  other  price  controls;
mandatory  community rating of premiums; medical liability reforms; amendment of
the antitrust laws to benefit  providers; authorization of provider networks  to
obtain  federal  licensure  as  Medicare  health  plans;  mandatory  or optional
single-payer systems for all or part  of the population; and changes in  federal
tax,  Medicare and Medicaid laws and the Employee Retirement Income Security Act
of 1974  ("ERISA").  To varying  degrees,  many  of the  bills  contemplate  the
involvement of state governments in the regulation and implementation of federal
health care reform legislation.
 
    Recent  legislation  and  regulation  in certain  of  the  states  where the
Company's HMOs  operate  has included  mandatory  minimum hospital  stays  after
childbirth;  incentives to  enroll individuals (including  Medicare and Medicaid
beneficiaries) and  small  groups  (including  financial  penalties  if  defined
enrollment targets are not achieved); "any willing provider" statutes that would
require  the  Company's HMOs  to  accept all  providers  who agree  to  meet the
Company's terms, restrictions on medical
 
                                       7
<PAGE>
underwriting;  mandated  offering  of  small  group  and  individual   coverage,
including  specified  plan  designs;  guaranteed  policy  renewability; mandated
continuous  open  enrollment  for   individuals  and  small  groups;   financial
assessments  for the  individual and small  group markets  intended to subsidize
eligible carriers (some or all of which assessments may or may not be  reflected
in increased premium rates); mandatory or voluntary regional health alliances or
purchasing  cooperatives; and  minimum medical loss  ratios in  certain lines of
business. Similar  legislation or  regulation  is likely  to be  introduced  and
possibly  enacted  in other  states in  which the  Company does  business. Other
proposed state  laws and  regulations  include restrictions  on the  ability  of
managed care entities to negotiate payment rates with providers, restrictions on
the  Company's discretion to make benefit determinations, disclosure obligations
relative  to  marketing   and  advertising,  more   stringent  license   renewal
requirements,  and mandated benefits. Several  states, including New Jersey, are
contemplating major  revisions  to HMO  regulation  which include  many  of  the
foregoing areas.
 
    The  Company is  unable to  predict how existing  federal or  state laws and
regulations may be changed or  interpreted, what additional laws or  regulations
affecting  its businesses  may be  enacted or  proposed, when  and which  of the
proposed laws will be adopted and what effect the new laws and regulations  will
have on its businesses.
 
    Federally  qualified  HMOs,  such  as those  operated  by  the  Company, are
required to establish premium rates  prospectively and without regard to  actual
utilization  of services  by individual  members, using  one of  three community
rating methods.  These  rates  may  vary from  account  to  account  to  reflect
projected  family size and contract mix, benefit levels, renewal date, and other
factors. Under  one of  these methods,  "traditional community  rating," an  HMO
establishes  premium  rates based  on its  revenue  requirements for  its entire
enrollment in  a given  community. Under  "community rating  by class,"  an  HMO
establishes premium rates based on its revenue requirements for broad classes of
membership  distinguished by factors such as  age and sex. Under "group specific
community rating," an HMO establishes premium  rates based on the HMO's  revenue
requirements for providing services to the group. New York, one of the principal
states  in which  the Company operates,  generally permits HMOs  to set premiums
only in accordance with the traditional community rating method. Several of  the
other  states  in  which the  Company  operates  HMOs permit  use  of  all three
community rating  methods. State  laws in  certain of  the states  in which  the
Company  operates HMOs require the filing with  and approval by the state of HMO
premium rates. In addition to  reviewing anticipated medical costs, some  states
also  review anticipated administrative  costs as part  of the approval process.
Future results of the Company could  be affected if the premium rates  requested
by  the Company are  not approved or  are adjusted downward  (possibly to levels
lower than rates previously approved) by state regulators.
 
    Most states, including those in which the Company now operates HMOs, require
HMOs to be licensed prior to  commencing operations. If the Company  establishes
an HMO in any state where it does not presently operate an HMO, it generally has
to seek licensure. The time necessary to obtain an HMO license varies from state
to  state. Each HMO must file periodic  financial and operating reports with the
states in which  it does business.  In addition, HMO  operations are subject  to
state examination and periodic license renewal.
 
    The Company has three insurance subsidiaries, one domiciled in Minnesota and
licensed  in 46 other states and the  District of Columbia, one domiciled in New
York and one domiciled in Connecticut. The Company's insurance subsidiaries  are
subject to regulation in each state in which licensed.
 
    The  Company is subject  to federal and state  regulations which require the
Company's subsidiaries to  maintain certain  levels of tangible  net assets,  as
defined,  for use  in their  own operations.  Certain states  also require prior
approval before  dividends  are  paid  or funds  are  otherwise  transferred  to
affiliates.
 
    The provision of goods and services to certain employee health benefit plans
is  subject  to  ERISA,  a  complex  set  of  laws  and  regulations  subject to
interpretation  and  enforcement  by  the  Internal  Revenue  Service  and   the
Department  of  Labor.  ERISA  regulates certain  aspects  of  the relationships
 
                                       8
<PAGE>
between the Company and employers who maintain employee benefit plans subject to
ERISA. Some of the administrative services  and other activities of the  Company
may  also be subject to regulation under ERISA. In addition, some states require
licensure or registration  of companies  such as the  Company's subsidiary  that
provides third party claims administration services for benefit plans.
 
CAUTIONARY STATEMENTS
 
    The  Private Securities Litigation  Reform Act of 1995  provides a new "safe
harbor"  for  forward-looking  statements  to  encourage  companies  to  provide
prospective information about their companies without fear of litigation so long
as  those statements  are identified as  forward-looking and  are accompanied by
meaningful cautionary statements identifying important factors that could  cause
actual  results to differ materially from those projected in the statements. The
Company desires to take advantage of this "safe harbor" and, accordingly, hereby

sections of  this  filing, including  Management's  Discussion and  Analysis  of
Financial Condition and Results of Operations.
 
ITEM 2:    PROPERTIES
 
    The  Company owns three office buildings  having an aggregate 457,000 square
feet  in  Blue   Bell,  Pennsylvania.  These   buildings  house  the   Company's
headquarters and much of its administrative and customer service operations. The
Company  also  owns  and  occupies  a 110,000  square  foot  office  building in
Fairfield, New Jersey, which  houses certain regional  activities, and a  65,000
square  foot warehouse  near its headquarters.  The Company  leases an aggregate
490,000 square feet of  office space in sixteen  other facilities housing  other
regional  and branch offices,  additional warehouse space  and additional member
relations and provider payments personnel.
 
ITEM 3:    LEGAL PROCEEDINGS
 
    On October 12, 1993, the  Company filed a petition  with the New York  State
Supreme   Court  seeking  to  stay  and   annul  the  Opinion  and  Decision  of
Superintendent of Insurance of the State  of New York dated September 30,  1993,
which  would have reduced the  premium rates for the  Company's New York HMO for
the twelve month period beginning October 1, 1993 by a weighted average of  3.9%
from  the rates in effect for the  preceding twelve month period. On November 1,
1993, the  Court held  a hearing  and ordered  that a  stay should  be  granted.
Accordingly, for New York HMO group contracts renewed or entered into during the
first quarter of 1994, the Company generally charged the premium rates in effect
during the third quarter of 1993. The Court entered a written Order and Decision
on  July 8, 1994, implementing  the November 1, 1993  oral decision on the basis
that the Superintendent  violated the New  York Insurance Law  (by reducing  the
Company's  premium rates without giving the Company an opportunity to oppose the
reduction) and remanding the matter to the Superintendent for a proper  hearing.
On  August  4,  1994, the  Superintendent  filed  a Notice  of  Appeal  with the
Appellate Division; the appeal was dismissed on October 11, 1994. On October 13,
1994, the  Superintendent  moved  for  permission to  appeal  to  the  Appellate
Division; this motion was denied on January 17, 1995. The Superintendent did not
appeal  from  the  decisions  of  the Appellate  Division.  The  portion  of the
litigation related to rates  for contracts entered into  or renewed on or  after
April  1,  1994  through  September  30,  1994  was  implicitly  mooted  by  the
Superintendent's Opinion and  Decision dated  April 29,  1994 approving  revised
rates  for such period, leaving  only that portion of  the litigation related to
rates for contracts  entered into or  renewed during the  first quarter of  1994
subject  to a possible hearing. On  August 15, 1995, the Superintendent notified
the Company that he had decided not  to hold a hearing concerning the  Company's
premium rates for the first quarter of 1994, thereby
 
                                       10
<PAGE>
leaving  in place the third quarter of  1993 premium rates generally charged for
that quarter. Subsequently, a stipulation executed by the Superintendent and the
Company dismissing the action was filed.
 
    Two class action complaints  have been filed in  the United States  District
Court  for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania seeking unspecified damages. The
complaints allege that the  Company and two of  its executive officers,  through
certain  misrepresentations and  omissions about  the Company,  violated federal
securities laws and  related state law.  The court has  granted the  plaintiffs'
motion  for class certification as to the federal claims but has denied it as to
the state claims. The litigation is still in the preliminary stages, and  merits
discovery  has just begun. The Company  has denied the allegations and continues
to defend the actions vigorously.
 
    The Company  is  also involved  in  legal actions  concerning  benefit  plan
coverage  and other decisions by the Company, and alleged medical malpractice by
participating providers. If found liable  in such actions, which are  vigorously
defended  on several grounds, the Company may bear financial responsibility. The
Company is also involved  in certain other claims  and legal actions arising  in
the  ordinary course of business. In the opinion of management, these claims and
legal actions  will  not  have  a  material  adverse  effect  on  the  Company's
consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows.
 
ITEM 4:    SUBMISSION OF MATTERS TO A VOTE OF SECURITY HOLDERS
 
    No  matter was  submitted to  a vote of  security holders  during the fourth
quarter of 1995.

REPORT OF ERNST & YOUNG LLP, INDEPENDENT AUDITORS

The Board of Directors and Shareholders
U.S. Healthcare, Inc.

We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of U.S. 
Healthcare, Inc. as of December 31, 1995 and 1994, and the related 
consolidated statements of income, shareholders' equity and cash flows for 
each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 1995. These 
financial statements are the responsibility of the Company's management. Our 
responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements based 
on our audits.

We conducted our audits in accordance with generally accepted auditing 
standards. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to 
obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free 
of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, 
evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. 
An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and 
significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall 
financial statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a 
reasonable basis for our opinion.

In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above 
present fairly, in all material respects, the consolidated financial position 
of U.S. Healthcare, Inc. at December 31, 1995 and 1994, and the consolidated 
results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in 
the period ended December 31, 1995, in conformity with generally accepted 
accounting principles.

As discussed in Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company 
changed its method of accounting for marketable securities as of December 31, 
1993.

                   NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
1. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

PRINCIPLES OF CONSOLIDATION-The consolidated financial statements include the 
accounts of U.S. Healthcare, Inc. and its subsidiaries (the Company), all of 
which are wholly owned except for certain subsidiaries which are not health 
maintenance organizations (HMOs). All significant intercompany transactions 
have been eliminated in consolidation.

USE OF ESTIMATES-The preparation of financial statements in conformity with 
generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make 
estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the 
consolidated financial statements and notes to consolidated financial 
statements. Actual results could differ from those estimates.

CASH, CASH EQUIVALENTS AND MARKETABLE SECURITIES-Cash equivalents classified 
with cash consist of all highly liquid instruments which mature within three 
months from the date of purchase. The carrying amounts of cash and cash 
equivalents reported in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets 
approximate fair value. Marketable securities consist of debt securities. The 
Company determines the appropriate classification of debt securities at the 
time of purchase and reevaluates such classification as of each balance sheet 
date. At December 31, 1995 and 1994, all securities are classified as 
available for sale. Such securities are carried at fair value and cumulative 
net unrealized gains or losses, less applicable income taxes, are recorded as 
a separate component of shareholders' equity. Realized gains and losses and 
unrealized losses judged to be other than temporary are included in net 
income. Fair values of marketable securities are based on quoted market 
prices, where available. If quoted market prices are not available, fair 
values are based on market prices of comparable instruments. The cost of 
securities sold is based on the specific identification method.

At December 31, 1995 and 1994, $50,771,000 and $33,405,000, 
respectively, of the Company's marketable securities were held by trustees
or state regulatory agencies in accordance with certain state requirements
relating principally to HMOs. Such securities are classified as non-current
assets. The Company determined that other marketable securities held as of
December 31, 1995 and 1994 were available for use in current operations and,
accordingly, classified such securities as current assets without regard to
the securities' contractual maturity dates. 

The Company adopted Statement of Financial Accounting Standards Number 115 
(FAS 115), "Accounting for Certain Investments in Debt and Equity Securities" 
as of December 31, 1993. The adoption of FAS 115 had no effect on net income 
but, as of December 31, 1993, increased marketable securities by $38,204,000, 
representing net unrealized gains, and shareholders' equity by $23,301,000 
(net unrealized gains less deferred income taxes of $14,903,000). 

PROPERTY AND EQUIPMENT-Property and equipment, stated at cost, are 
depreciated on the straight-line method over their estimated useful lives for 
financial reporting purposes and under accelerated methods for income tax 
purposes.

OPERATING REVENUE-Premiums for prepaid health care are recognized as income 
in the month in which the enrollees are entitled to health care services. 
Administrative services fees are recognized as income as services are 
rendered.

MEDICAL COSTS-Medical costs consist principally of medical claims and 
capitation costs. Medical claims include estimates of payments to be made on 
claims reported as of the balance sheet date and estimates of health care 
services rendered but not reported to the Company as of the balance sheet 
date. Such estimates include the cost of services which will continue to be 
rendered after the balance sheet date if the Company

                                     28
<PAGE>

is obligated to pay for such services in accordance with contract provisions 
or regulatory requirements. Medical claims payable are estimated periodically 
and any resulting adjustments are included in current operations. Capitation 
costs represent monthly fees to participating primary care physicians and 
other medical providers as retainers for providing continuing health care 
services.

ADVERTISING COSTS-The Company expenses advertising costs as incurred. 
Advertising costs were $47,057,000, $37,129,000 and $28,435,000 in 1995, 
1994, and 1993, respectively.

INCOME TAXES-Deferred income taxes reflect the net tax effects of temporary 
differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for 
financial reporting purposes and the amounts used for income tax purposes. 
Such temporary differences include depreciation and amortization, allowance 
for doubtful accounts, accrued compensated absences, deferred compensation 
and net unrealized gains or losses on marketable securities.

RETIREMENT PLANS-The Company has a defined contribution pension plan covering 
substantially all of its employees, subject to certain age and service 
requirements. The Company's contribution for each eligible employee is a 
percentage of the employee's compensation, as defined. The Company also has 
an employee savings plan (401(k)) available to all its employees, subject to 
certain age and service requirements. The Company matches 33 1/3% of the 
employee's contribution, up to a maximum of 2% of the employee's annual 
compensation. The Company funds pension and savings plan costs accrued. The 
Company has a retiree health benefit plan covering substantially all its 
employees (except for certain "key employees," as defined in the plan), 
subject to certain age and service requirements set forth in the plan. 
Company contributions, which are at the Company's sole discretion, are paid 
to a voluntary employees' beneficiary association (VEBA) trust. Any such 
contributions to the VEBA trust are allocated and credited to separate 
accounts established for each eligible employee and for each employee's 
eligible spouse. Funds accumulated in these separate accounts are used to 
fund all or a portion of the premiums for health care benefit coverage for 
eligible retired employees and their eligible spouses. When funds in these 
separate accounts are exhausted, neither the Company nor the VEBA trust have 
any obligation to make any further contributions or payments. Retirement plan 
costs were $14,199,000, $14,375,000 and $14,322,000 in 1995, 1994 and 1993, 
respectively.

NET INCOME PER COMMON AND COMMON EQUIVALENT SHARE-Primary and fully diluted 
net income per common and common equivalent share are based upon the 
applicable weighted average number of common and common equivalent (Class B 
stock and stock options) shares outstanding during the year, after giving 
effect to the stock split explained in Note 7.

ACCOUNTING STANDARDS ISSUED BUT NOT YET ADOPTED-In March 1995, the Financial 
Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued Financial Accounting Standard Number 
121 (FAS 121), "Accounting for the Impairment of Long-Lived Assets and for 
Long-Lived Assets to Be Disposed Of," which addresses accounting for the 
impairment of long-lived assets such as property and equipment, identifiable 
intangible assets and goodwill. The prospective implementation of FAS 121, 
which must be adopted in 1996, is not expected to have a material effect on 
the Company's consolidated financial position or results of operations. 

In October 1995, the FASB issued Financial Accounting Standard Number 123 
(FAS 123), "Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation," which prescribes 
accounting and reporting standards for all stock-based compensation plans, 
including employee stock options and restricted stock plans. Under FAS 123, 
companies may adopt a fair value method of expense recognition for all 
stock-based compensation or continue to account for all stock-based 
compensation under the measurement standards of Accounting Principles Board 
Opinion Number 25, "Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees" (APB 25). The 
implementation of FAS 123 in 1996 is not expected to affect the Company's 
consolidated financial position or results of operations because the Company 
presently expects to continue to apply the principles of APB 25.

6. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS

Two class action complaints have been filed the United States District Court 
for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania seeking unspecified damages. The 
complaints allege that the Company and two of its executive officers, through 
certain misrepresentations and omissions about the Company, violated federal 
securities laws and related state law. The Court has granted the plaintiffs' 
motion for class certification as to the federal claims but has denied it as 
to the state claims. The litigation is still in the preliminary stages, and 
merits discovery has just begun. The Company has denied the allegations and 
continues to defend the actions vigorously. 

The Company is also involved in legal actions concerning benefit plan coverage 
and other decisions by the Company, and alleged medical malpractice by 
participating providers. If found liable in such actions, which are vigorously 
defended on several grounds, the Company may bear financial responsibility. 
The Company is also involved in certain other claims and legal actions arising 
in the ordinary course of business. In the opinion of management, these claims 
and legal actions will not have a material adverse effect on the Company's 
consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows.

7. SHAREHOLDERS' EQUITY 

On February 22, 1994, the Board of Directors declared a 3 for 2 stock split on 
common and Class B stock effected in the form of a 50% stock dividend paid on 
March 29, 1994. The effects of this stock split have been reflected in 
shareholders' equity as of December 31, 1993 as if the stock split had 
occurred as of that date. Amounts shown as cash dividends paid per common and 
Class B share for all periods presented reflect the effects of this stock 
split.





Class B stock is convertible into common stock on a share for share basis and 
is entitled to receive cash dividends in an amount not to exceed 90% of cash 
dividends paid on common stock. Voting rights are one vote per share for 
common stock and fifty votes per share for Class B stock.

The Company is authorized to issue 50,000,000 shares of preferred stock with 
no par value. No shares were issued as of December 31, 1995 and 1994.

The Company has incentive stock plans that provide for grants of stock options 
and restricted stock awards. Recipients of stock options include employees, 
members of the Board of Directors and certain physicians who contract with the 
Company. Generally, the option price is not less than the market value of the 
stock when the options are granted. Options granted under the plans are 
generally exercisable commencing one year from the date of grant in increments 
ranging from 20% to 33 1/3% a year. Continued affiliation with the Company is a 
condition of vesting and exercise. Restricted stock awards of common stock are 
granted to selected employees and certain physicians who contract with the 
Company, subject to forfeiture if affiliation with the Company terminates or 
violations of other terms of the awards occur prior to the end of the 
prescribed restriction period. Shares are granted without payment to the 
Company. Recipients have all of 

                                       32

<PAGE>

the rights of shareholders except that the shares are deposited with the 
Company and cannot be disposed of until the restrictions have lapsed. The 
approximate fair value (as of the award date) of shares awarded is accrued, 
and charged to expense ratably as the restrictions are lifted and the shares 
released to the recipients.

Information concerning options outstanding for the two most recent years, 
after giving effect to the stock split described above, is as follows:

8. CONTRACTUAL ARRANGEMENTS WITH PROVIDERS

The Company generally compensates primary care physicians through prospective 
compensation arrangements which incorporate quality assessment standards, 
comprehensiveness of care, utilization and office status components. These 
components are used to adjust the capitation payments to individual physician 
offices and to determine the amount of additional periodic payments. The 
Company has prospective compensation arrangements for mental health, substance 
abuse, diagnostic laboratory, radiology and diagnostic imaging services, 
podiatric treatment, physical therapy and prescription drug dispensing. The 
Company has contracts that provide for all-inclusive per diem and per case 
hospitalization rates and fixed rates for ambulatory surgery, emergency room 
services and specialist services. The Company has also entered into 
quality-based compensation arrangements with certain hospitals, as well as 
agreements with certain integrated health delivery systems under which the 
systems are compensated on a substantially fixed prospective basis for medical 
services, including primary, specialist and hospital care. The arrangements 
described above cover the majority of medical services.

capital requirements and the general financial condition of the Company. Cash 
dividends on the Class B stock may be paid only when dividends on the common 
stock are declared and paid. Cash dividends on a share of Class B stock cannot 
exceed 90% of the cash dividends on a share of common stock.

MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF 
FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

GENERAL

Substantially all of the Company's revenue is generated from premiums received 
for health care coverage provided to its members. These premiums represent 
approximately 98%, 99% and 99% of the Company's operating revenue for the 
years ended December 31, 1995, 1994 and 1993, respectively. The Company's 
operating expenses are primarily medical costs consisting principally of 
medical claims and capitation costs.

The Company's results of operations depend in large part on accurately 
predicting and effectively managing medical costs and other operating 
expenses. A variety of factors and risks, including competition, changes in 
health care practices, changes in federal or state laws and regulations or the 
interpretations thereof, inflation, provider contract changes, new 
technologies, government-imposed surcharges, taxes or assessments, reductions 
in provider payments by governmental payors (including Medicare and Medicaid) 
(such reductions may cause providers to seek higher payments from private 
payors), major epidemics, disasters, changes in product mix and entry into new 
geographic markets (both of which may result in an increase in members 
obtaining care from providers not under contract with the Company) and 
numerous other factors affecting the delivery and cost of health care, may in 
the future affect the Company's ability to control its medical costs and other 
operating expenses. Governmental action (including downward adjustments to 
premium rates) or business conditions (including intensification of 
competition and the other factors described above) could result in premium 
revenues not increasing to offset increases in medical costs and other 
operating expenses. Once set, premiums are generally fixed for one-year 
periods and, accordingly, unanticipated costs during such periods cannot be 
recovered through higher premiums. The expiration, suspension, termination of, 
or failure to obtain contracts to provide health coverage for governmental 
entities or other significant customers would also negatively impact the 
Company. Due to these factors and risks, no assurance can be given with 
respect to the Company's premium levels or its ability to control its medical 
costs. 

Legislative and regulatory proposals have been made at the federal and state 
government levels related to the health care system, including but not limited 
to limitations on managed care organizations (including benefit mandates, 
provider contract limitations, restrictions on utilization management, premium 
assessments or taxes to pay for uncompensated care and any willing provider 
requirements) and changes in the Medicare and Medicaid programs. Legislative 
or regulatory action could also have the effect of reducing the premiums paid 
to the Company by governmental programs or increasing the Company's medical 
costs. Specifically, potential federal legislation would reduce the premiums 
payable to the Company under the Medicare program as compared to previously 
announced levels; other potential legislation and regulation could have the 
result of reducing the premiums payable to the Company under state Medicaid 
programs. The Company is unable to predict the specific content of any 
legislation or regulation that may be enacted or when or in what jurisdictions 
any such legislation or regulation will be adopted. Therefore, the Company 
cannot predict the effect of such legislation or regulation on the Company's 
business. For additional factors and risks, see the Company's Annual Report on 
Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 1995.

OPERATIONS

1995 COMPARED TO 1994

Operating revenue increased $608,524,000 or 21%, principally due to growth in 
U.S. Healthcare-insured health plan enrollment (375,000 additional members). 

                                       37

<PAGE>

Commercial premiums increased $335,744,000 or 13%. The principal factor for 
the increase was a 13% increase in Commercial member months (the sum of 
members enrolled in each month during the year). The average premium for the 
Commercial plans, which at December 31, 1995, had about 1,874,000 members, 
decreased 1% to approximately $138 per member per month.

Government premiums consist principally of Medicare and Medicaid premiums. 
Medicare premiums increased $205,600,000 or 115%. The principal factor for the 
increase was a 125% increase in Medicare member months, offset by the effect 
of lower average premiums per member. The average premium for the Medicare 
plans, which at December 31, 1995, had about 108,000 members, decreased 4% to 
$437 per member per month. Medicaid and other premiums increased $44,186,000 
or 71%. The principal factor for the increase was a 105% increase in Medicaid 
member months offset by the effects of lower premiums per member. The average 
premium for the Medicaid plans, which at December 31, 1995, had about 81,000 
members, decreased 9% to $125 per member per month.

The following table shows total premiums earned in 1995 and the increase in 
premiums compared to 1994 by plan type.

</TABLE>

Other operating revenue, which consists principally of administrative services 
fees, increased $22,994,000 or 70%, principally due to a 37% increase in 
employer-funded health plan members. At December 31, 1995, the Company had 
about 371,000 members in employer-funded health plans.

Medical costs increased $583,053,000 or 29% over 1994, primarily due to a 17% 
growth in U.S. Healthcare-insured member months, and higher costs per member. 
Compared to 1994, the weighted average medical cost per member increased 11% 
to $111 per member per month. Factors for the per member increase include 
changes in product and geographic mix, contractual changes in provider rates, 
higher specialist usage, higher capitation rates and the inclusion of a 
pharmacy benefit for most Medicare members. Compared to 1994, medical costs 
rose 5% to $101 per member per month for Commercial plans, 6% to $352 per 
member per month for Medicare plans and 22% to $109 per member per month for 
Medicaid plans. 




Administrative, marketing and other operating costs increased $90,506,000 or 
28% over 1994. Personnel costs contributed the largest increase as a result of 
higher salaries and an increase in the number of employees necessitated, in 
part, by higher business volume and changes in product mix, and increased 
marketing capability.

Investment income increased $26,659,000 or 41% from 1994, principally due to
realized gains on sales of marketable securities and earnings on higher
average portfolio balances. Net realized gains were $15,079,000 in 1995
compared to net realized losses of $2,461,000 in 1994.

Net income for 1995 was $381 million compared to $391 million in 1994. On a 
per share basis, net income was $2.42 in 1995 and 1994, reflecting the effects 
of the Company's repurchase of 6.9 million shares of its common stock during 
1995. 

                                       38

1994 COMPARED TO 1993

Operating revenue increased $329,362,000 or 13%, principally due to growth in 
U.S. Healthcare-insured health plan enrollment (175,000 additional members).

Commercial premiums increased $233,190,000 or 10%. The principal factors for 
the increase were an 8% increase in Commercial member months and higher premium 
rates. The average premium for the Commercial plans, which at December 31, 
1994, had about 1,595,000 members, increased 1% to approximately $139 per 
member per month.

Government premiums consist principally of Medicare and Medicaid premiums. 
Medicare premiums increased $43,581,000 or 32%. The principal factor for the 
increase was a 35% increase in Medicare member months, offset by the effect of 
lower average premiums per member. The average premium for the Medicare plans, 
which at December 31, 1994, had about 38,000 members, decreased 2% to $457 per 
member per month. Medicaid and other premiums increased $40,033,000 or 178%. 
The principal factor for the increase was a 216% increase in Medicaid member 
months offset by the effects of lower premiums per member. The average premium 
for the Medicaid plans, which at December 31, 1995, had about 51,000 members, 
decreased 7% to $138 per member per month. On December 31, 1994, the Company 
also had about 271,000 members in employer-funded health plans.

premiums compared to 1993 by plan type.

Medical costs increased $132,795,000 or 7% over 1993, primarily due to a 12% 
growth in U.S. Healthcare-insured membership, partly offset by lower costs per 
member.

Administrative, marketing and other operating costs increased $42,786,000 or 
15% over 1993. Personnel costs contributed the largest increase as a result of 
higher salaries and an increase in the number of employees necessitated, in 
part, by higher business volume and changes in product mix, and increased 
marketing capability.

Investment income was virtually unchanged from 1993, because net realized 
losses on sales of marketable securities and a decrease in the yield on 
investments combined to offset the effect of higher investment portfolio 
balances.

LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES

The Company's liquidity requirements have been met from cash flows generated 
by operating activities. In 1995, net cash flows from such activities were 
$493,686,000. The Company believes that its existing financial resources are 
sufficient to meet its liquidity needs.

The Company's operations are conducted principally through HMO and insurance 
subsidiaries. These subsidiaries are subject to state regulations which 
require the subsidiaries to maintain certain levels of equity, as defined. 
Levels of required equity vary by state and, in some states, vary depending on 
premium revenue, medical costs, the cost of care delivered by providers not 
under contract to the Company and other factors. As of December 31, 1995, the 
amount of equity so required was approximately $88 million. The effect of this 
required equity is to limit, for use in the subsidiaries' own respective 
operations, assets such as cash, marketable securities and receivables in an 
amount equal to the sum of the subsidiaries' liabilities plus their required 
equity. As of December 31, 1995, cash and marketable securities limited for 
such use in the subsidiaries' operations under these requirements totaled 
approximately $560 million. Regulations which were adopted but were not yet 
effective would have increased the subsidiaries' required equity (and 
increased the amount of assets limited as aforesaid) by approximately $30 
million as of December 31, 1995. Other changes in equity requirements are 
being considered at the state and federal levels, which may cause the amount 
of equity required to be maintained by subsidiaries to increase. Changes in 
the factors underlying existing equity requirements (such as an increase in 
premium revenue, medical costs or the cost of care delivered by providers not 
under contract to the Company) and expansion into new geographic markets may 
also cause the amount of the subsidiaries' required equity to increase. Most 
states also require the subsidiaries to obtain approval or provide notice 
before funds in excess of certain thresholds are transferred to affiliates.
