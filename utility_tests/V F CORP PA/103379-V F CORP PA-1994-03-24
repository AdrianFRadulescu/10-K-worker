ITEM 1. BUSINESS.

     VF Corporation ("Corporation"), through its operating subsidiaries,
has designed, manufactured and marketed apparel principally in five business
groups: Jeanswear, Casual/Sportswear, Intimate Apparel, International and Other
Apparel.  Organized in 1899, the Corporation oversees the operations of its
subsidiaries, providing them with financial and administrative resources.  The
management of each operating company is independent and is responsible for the
growth and development of its business, within guidelines established by
corporate management.

     Information regarding the sales and profitability of each of the five
business groups over the past year and working capital requirements is included
in pages 9 to 20, 24, 25 and 27 of the Corporation's Annual Report to
Shareholders for its fiscal year ended January 1, 1994 ("1993 Annual Report"),
which information is incorporated herein by reference.

Jeanswear

     The Lee and the Wrangler divisions operating in the United States are the
principal components of the Jeanswear business group.  Lee manufactures
jeanswear and casual bottoms sold principally under its LEE(R) trademark.
During 1993, Lee successfully introduced the RIDERS brand of jeans and
casualwear.  Wrangler manufactures jeanswear primarily under its WRANGLER(R)
and RUSTLER(R) trademarks.  Wrangler also offers a line of shirts to complement
its jeanswear products.  Lee and  Wrangler offer a line of cotton casual pants
and shirts under the LEE CASUALS(R) AND TIMBER CREEK BY WRANGLER(R) brands.

     The Girbaud division is the third component of the Jeanswear business
group.  The Corporation, through its Girbaud division, uses the MARITHE &
FRANCOIS GIRBAUD(R) label in the United States to market branded fashion jeans
and casual apparel.  The MARITHE & FRANCOIS GIRBAUD(R) label is currently under
license arrangements through 1997, subject to a single 5 year renewal term.
Substantially all Girbaud products are manufactured by independent contractors
and are sold primarily to upscale department and specialty stores.

     According to industry data, approximately 425 million pairs of jeans made
of denim, twill, corduroy and other fabrics were sold in the United States in
1993.  This same data indicates that the Corporation currently has the largest
combined share of this market at approximately a 30% share, with the
RUSTLER(R), LEE(R) and WRANGLER(R) brands having the second, third and fourth
largest shares of the jeans market in the United States, respectively.

     Raw materials, consisting mainly of fabrics made from cotton and blends of
cotton and synthetics, are purchased from several suppliers against scheduled
production and are fabricated into garments in the Lee and Wrangler
manufacturing plants.  Management did not experience difficulty in obtaining
materials to meet production needs during 1993.

     In 1993, the Lee division repositioned its LEE(R) brand products by
marketing solely through department and specialty stores.  The RIDERS brand is
now sold through the mass merchant and discount store channels.  The Wrangler
division markets its WRANGLER(R) westernwear through western
specialty stores and its other WRANGLER(R) brand products primarily





                                      -3-
<PAGE>   4
through discount stores.  The RUSTLER(R) brand is a high quality, lower priced
brand marketed to large national discount chains.  Both Lee and Wrangler
maintain sales offices and showrooms in key cities across the United States.
Sales of Lee and Wrangler products are generally made directly to retailers
through full-time salespersons.  Sales of the Jeanswear business group are
slightly higher in the second half of the year.

     Lee and Wrangler advertise on television and radio and in various consumer
and trade publications.  They also participate in cooperative advertising in
radio, television and various print media.  Point-of-sale advertising is used
by Lee, Wrangler and Girbaud.

Casual/Sportswear

     Bassett-Walker is one of the nation's largest manufacturers of knitted
fleecewear.  Operations are vertically integrated and include the entire
process of converting cotton yarn into finished garments.  In December 1993,
Bassett-Walker sold its two yarn manufacturing plants to a major textile
company and entered into a long-term agreement to purchase yarn from that
company.  Previously, Bassett-Walker had produced the majority of its yarn
requirements.  Additional yarn is available from numerous outside sources.

     Sales of Bassett-Walker garments are seasonal, with approximately
two-thirds of its sales occurring during the second half of the year.
Principal customers are national chain and department stores, discount stores,
wholesalers and garment screen printing operators.  In 1993, more than 70% of
Bassett-Walker's volume was knitted fleecewear and T-shirts marketed under the
LEE(R) and RIDERS labels.  Products are also manufactured for private label
customers.  Sales are made by an in-house staff of salespersons throughout the
United States.  See "Recent Developments".

     Jantzen designs, manufactures and markets an extensive line of men's and
women's quality swimwear and sportswear, including sweaters and coordinated
tops and bottoms, primarily under the JANTZEN(R) trademark.  A significant
portion of Jantzen's products are manufactured by independent contractors.
Jantzen uses purchased yarn for its sweater manufacturing operations.  For
other products, purchased fabric is manufactured into finished garments.
Management anticipates no difficulty in obtaining raw materials.

     Jantzen products are sold primarily to department and specialty stores
through its sales staff.  Jantzen also manufactures and markets its products in
Canada, and the JANTZEN(R) trademark is licensed to other companies in several
foreign countries.

     JanSport purchases fleeced casualwear and T-shirts to imprint with college
logos for distribution through college bookstores.  JanSport also manufactures
JANSPORT(R) brand daypacks sold through college bookstores and department and
sporting goods stores and JANSPORT(R) backpacking/mountaineering gear sold
primarily through outdoor and sporting goods stores.

<PAGE>   5
Intimate Apparel

     Vanity Fair produces body fashions, daywear, sleepwear and loungewear.
Vanity Fair knits most of its fabric from cotton, polyester, nylon and
LYCRA(R)* yarn purchased generally from E.I. duPont DeNemours & Co.  Lace and
trim are purchased from outside sources.  Vanity Fair anticipates no difficulty
in obtaining its material requirements.

     The Vanity Fair division manufactures products under the VANITY FAIR(R)
label for domestic department and specialty stores.  In recent years, an
increasing amount of sales have been of VASSARETTE(R) brand products sold
through discount stores and products sold to private label customers.  Vanity
Fair sells most of its products through its own sales force with sales offices
located in various cities.  The VANITY FAIR(R) brand name is licensed in
several foreign countries.

     In July 1991, the Corporation acquired the BARBIZON(R) brand of intimate
apparel and its chain of leased retail stores.  Barbizon is known for its woven
sleepwear and loungewear products.

International

     With the Corporation's expansion in the European apparel markets,
international operations have been reported as a separate business group since
1992.  The International business group consists of Lee and Wrangler jeanswear
operations, primarily in Europe, and the recently acquired intimate apparel
operations, primarily in France and Spain.

     LEE(R) and WRANGLER(R) jeanswear and other casual products are
manufactured and marketed by wholly owned subsidiaries in European department 
and specialty stores.  In recent years, Lee and Wrangler have expanded their
European presence by establishing new subsidiaries, replacing certain licensee
and distributor operations, and by introducing MAVERICK(R) branded jeanswear
marketed through discount stores.

     Raw materials are purchased primarily from European suppliers and are
fabricated into garments in the Lee and Wrangler manufacturing plants in the
United Kingdom, Belgium, Malta and Poland.  In addition, a portion of the
international jeanswear products are manufactured by independent contractors.
Management expects no difficulty in obtaining raw materials.

     Internationally, jeanswear products are sold through the Lee and the
Wrangler sales forces and independent sales agents.  Lee and Wrangler have
licensed their brand names for jeanswear products in foreign markets where they
do not have production or sales operations.  Lee also participates in a joint
venture in Spain and Portugal.

     In January 1992, the Corporation acquired the capital stock of The Valero
Group, and in December 1992, the Corporation acquired the capital stock of Jean
Bellanger Enterprises and of Vives Vidal, S.A.  In December 1993, the 
Corporation acquired the principal operating assets of Central Corsetera, S.A.
These companies manufacture and market women's intimate apparel for
distribution primarily in France in department and specialty stores under the
LOU, BOLERO and SILHOUETTE brand names and in discount stores under the
VARIANCE, CARINA and SILTEX brand names.  In addition, intimate apparel is
manufactured and marketed in department and specialty stores primarily in 
Spain under the GEMMA, INTIMA CHERRY and BELCOR brand names.

*LYCRA is the registered trademark of E.I.duPont DeNemours & Co. for its
spandex elastic yarn.





                                      -5-
<PAGE>   6
     Raw materials are purchased primarily from European suppliers and are
fabricated into garments in manufacturing plants in France, Spain and Tunisia.
Management expects no difficulty in obtaining raw materials.

Other Apparel

     Red Kap is a leading producer of occupational and career apparel sold
primarily under the RED KAP(R) label.  To broaden its product offerings, Red
Kap acquired the WORKWEAR(TM) line of occupational apparel in November 1991.
Approximately 75% of Red Kap's sales are to industrial laundries that in turn
supply work clothes to employers, primarily on a rental basis, for on-the-job
wear by production, service and white-collar personnel.  Products include work
pants, slacks, work and dress shirts, overalls, jackets and smocks.  In
addition, Red Kap markets a line of work clothes nationally to retail stores
under the BIG BEN(R) brand name.  Fabrics, primarily cotton and synthetic
blends, are purchased and manufactured into finished garments.  Management
anticipates no difficulty in obtaining raw materials.

     Because industrial laundries generally maintain minimal inventories of
work clothes, a supplier's ability to offer rapid delivery is an important
factor in this market.  Red Kap's commitment to customer service has enabled
customer orders to be filled typically within 24 hours of receipt and has
helped to provide Red Kap with a significant share of the industrial laundry
rental business.

     The Corporation in March 1991 acquired Healthtex, a leading manufacturer
and marketer of infant and children's apparel.  Products marketed under the
HEALTHTEX(R) label are sold primarily to department and specialty stores
through its sales force.  Healthtex products are manufactured from purchased
cotton and synthetic fabrics.  Management anticipates no difficulty in
obtaining raw materials.


                              RECENT DEVELOPMENTS

     In January 1994, the Corporation acquired in separate transactions Nutmeg
Industries, Inc. and H. H. Cutler Company for an aggregate consideration of
approximately $506.9 million.

     Both of these companies design, manufacture and market imprinted sports
apparel under licenses granted by the four major American professional sports
leagues (Major League Baseball, the National Basketball Association, the
National Football League and the National Hockey League) and most major
American colleges and universities.  In addition, Cutler is one of the largest
youthwear apparel licensees of Walt Disney products and is the exclusive
licensee of Fisher-Price kidswear in the United States.  Nutmeg's products are
sold primarily in department and specialty stores, and Cutler's products are
sold primarily through mass merchants.

     The Corporation's Bassett-Walker division will supply a significant
portion of the fleece and T-shirt needs of both Nutmeg and Cutler.


                                 OTHER MATTERS

Competitive Factors

     Trademarks are of material importance to all of the Corporation's
operating subsidiaries and are protected by registration or otherwise in the
United States and most other markets where the related products are sold.





                                      -6-
<PAGE>   7
In addition, the Corporation uses the MARITHE & FRANCOIS GIRBAUD(R) label in
the United States under license arrangements through 1997, subject to a single 
5 year renewal term.

     The apparel industry is highly competitive and consists of a number of
domestic and foreign companies; some competitors have assets and sales greater
than those of the Corporation.  In addition, the Corporation competes with a
number of firms that produce and distribute only a limited number of products
similar to those sold by the Corporation or sell only in certain geographic
areas being supplied by the Corporation.

     A characteristic of the apparel industry is the requirement that a
manufacturer recognize fashion trends and adequately provide products to meet
such trends.  Competitive advantage in the industry is obtained by
manufacturing better quality, market-responsive apparel and delivering to the
retailer on time and at lower cost.  The Corporation is striving to achieve
this competitive edge with its Market Response System and proprietary FLOW
REPLENISHMENT SYSTEM(R).  The FLOW REPLENISHMENT SYSTEM(R) is capable of
recording the sale of an individual garment from the point of sale to the
consumer, creating and processing all necessary documentation, and shipping the
exact garment sold so that it is back on the selling store's shelf generally
within seven days.

Employees

     The Corporation employs approximately 62,000 men and women, of which
approximately 6,300 are covered by various collective bargaining agreements.
Employee relations are considered to be good.

Backlog

     The dollar amount of backlog of orders believed to be firm as of the end
of the Corporation's fiscal year and as of the end of the preceding fiscal year
is not material for an understanding of the business of the Corporation taken
as a whole.

ITEM 2. PROPERTIES.

     The Corporation owns or leases under capital leases most of its facilities
used for manufacturing, distribution and administrative activities.  Certain
other facilities are leased under operating leases that generally contain
renewal options.

     Management believes all facilities and machinery and equipment are in good
condition and are suitable for the Corporation's needs.  Manufacturing and
distribution facilities presently being utilized are summarized below for the
Corporation's business groups:

                          Other Apparel                             2,246,000
</TABLE>

In addition, the Corporation owns or leases various administrative and office
space.  The Corporation also owns or leases facilities having 2,590,000 square
feet of space that is used for factory outlet operations.  Approximately 76% of
the factory outlet space is used for selling and warehousing the Corporation's
products, with the balance consisting of space leased to tenants and common
areas.

     In June 1993, the Corporation completed the sale of certain factory outlet
locations for an aggregate consideration of $69 million.  The

Corporation is leasing from the developer that portion of the space utilized
for sale of the Corporation's products.  The sale of these assets resulted in
no significant gain or loss to the Corporation.

ITEM 3. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS.

     There are no material legal proceedings or investigations pending or
threatened to which the Corporation or any of its operating companies is a
party or of which any of their property is the subject.

     Notwithstanding the foregoing, the text under the caption "Other Matters"

                                 OTHER MATTERS
                                 -------------

     For purposes of complying with the amendments to the rules governing
Registration Statements on Form S-8 under the Securities Act of 1933, the
undersigned Corporation hereby undertakes as follows, which undertaking
shall be incorporated by reference into the Corporation's Registration
Statements on Form S-8 Nos. 33-26566 (filed January 12, 1989), 33-33621
(filed February 28, 1990) and 33-41241 (filed June 24, 1991):

     Insofar as indemnification for liabilities arising under the Securities
     Act of 1933 may be permitted to directors, officers and controlling
     persons of the Corporation pursuant to the foregoing provisions, or
     otherwise, the Corporation has been advised that in the opinion of the
     Securities and Exchange Commission such indemnification is against public
     policy as expressed in the Securities Act of 1933 and is, therefore,
     unenforceable.  In the event that a claim for indemnification against such
     liabilities (other than the payment by the Corporation of expenses
     incurred or paid by a director, officer or controlling person of the
     registrant in the successful defense of any action, suit or proceeding) is
     asserted by such director, officer or controlling person in connection
     with the securities being registered, the Corporation will, unless in the
     opinion of its counsel the matter has been settled by controlling
     precedent, submit to a court of appropriate jurisdiction the question
     whether such indemnification by it is against public policy as expressed
     in the Act and will be governed by the final adjudication of such issue.

The annual provisions for depreciation have been computed using the following
estimated useful lives: land improvements 5-20 years; buildings 10-40 years;
and machinery and equipment 3-10 years.

(A)   Other changes result primarily from the disposition of subsidiaries,
      reclassifications and foreign currency translation, and in 1993, the sale 
      of two yarn plants and certain factory outlet locations.

MANAGEMENT'S RESPONSIBILITY FOR
FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

Management of VF Corporation has prepared the accompanying financial statements
and is responsible for their content. We believe the statements accurately
report the financial position and operating results of the Corporation, on a
basis consistent with generally accepted accounting principles and management's
best estimates and judgments. Other financial information in this report is
consistent with these financial statements.

Management has established a system of internal control which we believe
reasonably assures that assets are safeguarded and that financial information
is accurately reported. Inherent in all systems of internal control are
limitations based on the recognition that the costs of such systems should be
related to the benefits to be derived. The internal control system is routinely
challenged by management, the independent auditors and our internal audit staff
to determine whether the internal control system continues to function
effectively. Significant auditor recommendations have been reviewed and adopted
when appropriate.

The Audit Committee of the Board of Directors meets periodically with the
independent and internal auditors to discuss the scope and findings of audit
work performed, the impact of financial reporting issues and the adequacy of
the internal control system. The independent auditors and internal auditors
have full access to the Committee, with and without the presence of management,
to discuss any appropriate matters.

REPORT OF ERNST & YOUNG
INDEPENDENT AUDITORS

Board of Directors and Shareholders
VF Corporation

We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of VF Corporation
as of January 1, 1994 and January 2, 1993, and the related consolidated
statements of income, cash flows, and common shareholders' equity for each of
the three fiscal years in the period ended January 1, 1994. These financial
statements are the responsibility of the Corporation's management. Our
responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements based on
our audits.

We conducted our audits in accordance with generally accepted auditing
standards. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of
material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence
supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. An audit
also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant
estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial
statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis
for our opinion.

In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present fairly, in
all material respects, the consolidated financial position of VF Corporation at
January 1, 1994 and January 2, 1993, and the consolidated results of its
operations and its cash flows for each of the three fiscal years in the period
ended January 1, 1994 in conformity with generally accepted accounting
principles.

MANAGEMENT'S ANALYSIS OF OPERATIONS


The primary objective of VF Corporation is to provide long-term growth
in shareholder value through superior operating performance and sound
investment strategies. In 1991 and 1992, our results surpassed Corporate
objectives of 10% growth in sales and earnings. And while sales growth exceeded
our 10% objective in 1993, restructuring charges and a difficult knitwear
industry environment prevented the Corporation from attaining our earnings
growth target for this year.

RESULTS OF OPERATIONS
Net sales in 1993 were up 13% over 1992 and 46% over 1991. These sales
increases resulted primarily from unit volume growth within existing divisions.
Less than 20% of the sales growth during the period 1991 to 1993 represented
sales from acquired companies.

Gross margins were 31.1% of sales in 1993, compared with 31.9% in 1992
and 30.9% in 1991. While the 1993 gross margin percentage was below 1992, it is
comparable with the Corporation's historical results. The 1993 percent was
lower than the 1992 level due to a provision for capacity reduction in knitwear
and significantly reduced margins at Girbaud.

Marketing and administrative expenses increased to 21.1% of sales in
1993, from 20.7% and 20.6% in 1992 and 1991, respectively. The inclusion of the
newly acquired international intimate apparel divisions in 1993, which have
historically maintained higher marketing spending levels, accounted for the
increase in 1993.

Interest income in 1993 included $24.4 million and in 1992 $8.3 million
related to refunds of prior years' income taxes. Excluding these unusual items,
interest income and expense were relatively flat during the three year period.

The increase in miscellaneous income (net) in 1993 over 1992 resulted from the
inclusion in 1992 of a $6.6 million provision representing the  cumulative
charge for postretirement benefits under Financial Accounting Standards No.
106. The 1993 amount was below 1991 due to lower tenant income on outlet stores
sold during 1993 and higher goodwill amortization expense in 1993.

The effective income tax rate was 38.4% in 1993, 36.9% in 1992 and 38.7% in
1991. The 1993 rate included the effect of the 1% increase in the United
States corporate income tax rate. The 1992 rate was reduced by a $9.2 million
refund of prior years' taxes.

OPERATING RESULTS BY BUSINESS GROUP
Sales in the Jeanswear business group, which includes the Wrangler, Lee,
Rustler, Riders and Marithe and Francois Girbaud brands in the United States,
increased by 11% in 1993 over 1992 and 53% over 1991 levels. Jeanswear
operating margins increased substantially during 1992, primarily due to
improvements at Lee. However, provisions for reorganization at Girbaud, after a
year of reduced sales and earnings, pushed Jeanswear operating margins in 1993
below the two prior years.

The Casual/Sportswear business group consists of Bassett-Walker, Jantzen and
JanSport. Industry-wide overcapacity in fleece and T-shirts in  1993 prompted a
provision for the reduction of knitwear production capacity at Bassett-Walker
and otherwise contributed to reduced operating results in this division. Sales
and operating profit increased at Jantzen and JanSport during the three year
period.

Sales at Vanity Fair, the largest division in the Intimate Apparel group, grew
in each of the three years, largely due to growth of the Vassarette
brand and increases in private label sales. The 1992 decline in sales in this
group was due to the reclassification of Modern Globe to Casual/Sportswear.
Operating margins in the Intimate Apparel group were reduced in 1993 due to
manufacturing difficulties at Vanity Fair resulting from a shift in product
mix. Operating margins were lower in 1991 than in 1992 as a result of cost
inefficiencies related to Vanity Fair's rapid growth.

The International business group includes all international operations,
presently represented by jeanswear and intimate apparel. In 1992, VF entered
the intimate apparel market in Europe through the acquisitions of Valero in
January and Vivesa and JBE in December. Valero accounted for a
substantial portion of the 1992 sales increase in this group, and in 1993 the
three intimate apparel companies represented more than half of the increase in
sales from 1991. Jeanswear includes both Lee and Wrangler jeanswear operations,
primarily in Europe. Jeanswear sales increased in 1993 and 1992 from higher
unit volume in existing operations and the opening of new subsidiaries.
Jeanswear operating profit increased significantly in 1993, returning to the
1991 level as a percent of sales. Operating profit of the International group
in 1992 was lower as a percent of sales due to additional advertising costs
within the jeanswear operations and the inclusion of Valero, which reported a
nominal operating profit. Operating margins of the international intimate
apparel companies are lower than the jeanswear companies.

Red Kap and Healthtex are the major components of the Other Apparel group.
Sales have increased during the three year period at Red Kap, partly due to
the late 1991 acquisition of WorkWear, and at Healthtex, which was acquired in
early 1991. The primary factor in the improved operating margin in this
category in 1993 versus 1992 was the substantial profit turnaround at
Healthtex. The decline in the operating margin in 1992 from 1991 reflected the
effects on Red Kap of a difficult economic climate within the nation's
manufacturing sector.

MANAGEMENT'S ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION
In managing its capital structure, VF balances financial leverage with equity
capital to reduce its overall cost of capital, while providing the flexibility
to pursue investment opportunities that may become available.

In January 1993, the Corporation sold 4.6 million shares of Common Stock. While
proceeds were specifically used to repay short-term borrowings that temporarily
financed the business acquisitions completed during 1992, the offering provided
additional flexibility within the Corporation's overall capital structure.

It is management's goal to maintain a debt to capital ratio of less than 40%.
Our debt to capital ratio was within these guidelines at the end of 1993, at
30.3%. At the end of 1992, this ratio was 44.8%. However, on a pro forma basis,
assuming the equity offering had occurred as of year-end 1992, the ratio was
33.9%. Despite our goal to maintain the debt ratio below 40%, we will exceed
this level if warranted by appropriate investment opportunities.

BALANCE SHEET
The increase in total assets in 1993 was less than the volume growth in our
businesses. This was due to several factors, including controls over working
capital, the sale of certain outlet store facilities that are now being leased,
and the sale of our yarn making facilities.

Accounts receivable and inventories at the end of 1992 included those of the
two newly acquired international intimate apparel companies, purchased on
December 30, 1992. However, due to the date of acquisition, operating results
of these new divisions were not included in the Corporation's 1992 reported
numbers. Excluding the receivables of those divisions at the end of 1992, the
increase in accounts receivable in 1993 was consistent with the growth in sales
during the period. On a similar basis, the increase in inventories in 1993 was
at a rate less than the growth in sales.

Short-term borrowings at January 2, 1993 totaled $357.7 million, which include
$231.9 million classified as long-term debt due to their repayment in January
1993 from the proceeds of the sale of VF Common Stock. Short-term borrowings
were further reduced by the end of 1993 by cash generated from operations
during the year.

LIQUIDITY AND CASH FLOW
The Corporation maintains a relatively liquid financial position. Because the
increase in working capital in 1993 over 1992 was less than the growth in
sales, the current ratio improved to 2.3 to 1 in 1993 versus 2.0 to 1 in 1992.

Cash provided by operations of $294 million in 1993 was comparable to the
amount in 1991 of $287 million. Cash provided in 1992 was substantially lower
at $123 million due to increases in inventories and accounts receivable that
were not proportionate to volume growth.

Capital expenditures in 1993 were comparable to 1992 at $209 million and $207
million, respectively. The increase in spending over the 1991 level of $111
million was required to support the capacity needs resulting from growth,
particularly in the domestic jeanswear operations.  Capital expenditures in
1994, which should approximate the 1993 level, are expected to be funded by
operations. In addition, the Corporation's strong financial position provides
substantial unused borrowing capacity to meet other investment opportunities
that may arise.

Dividends totaled $1.22 per common share in 1993, compared with $1.11 in 1992
and $1.02 in 1991. The dividend payout rate was 32% in 1993, 28% in 1992 and
37% in 1991. The indicated annual dividend rate for 1994 is $1.28 per share. VF
has paid dividends on its Common Stock annually since 1941 and intends to
maintain a long-term payout rate of 30%.

OTHER MATTERS
The Corporation is a defendant in an action initiated in 1990 alleging
infringement of a patent allegedly relating to a process, commonly called "acid
wash", used in the production of certain denim garments. Similar actions have
been brought against other denim apparel manufacturers. The Corporation is
vigorously contesting the action and believes that it has numerous substantive
defenses. No trial date has been set. Based on currently available information
and the advice of counsel, management is not in a position to determine the
likelihood of the outcome of the action with certainty. Notwithstanding,
management believes at this time that the outcome will not have a material
impact on the financial position of the Corporation.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

The Corporation's principal business is designing, manufacturing and marketing
high quality jeanswear, casual/sportswear, intimate apparel and other apparel.
The Corporation's customers are primarily department, discount and specialty
stores.

NOTE A - ACCOUNTING POLICIES

Principles of Consolidation: The consolidated financial statements include the
accounts of all wholly owned subsidiaries after elimination of intercompany
transactions and profits.

Inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market. Inventories stated on
the last-in, first-out basis represent 32% of total 1993 and 30% of 1992
inventories. Remaining inventories are valued using the first-in, first-out
method.

Property and Depreciation: Property, plant and equipment are stated at cost.
Depreciation is computed principally by the straight-line method for financial
reporting purposes and by accelerated methods for income tax purposes.

Intangible Assets represent the excess of costs over net tangible assets of
businesses acquired, less accumulated amortization of $140.0 million and $120.9
million in 1993 and 1992. These assets are amortized on the straight-line
method over five to forty years.

Income Taxes: The Corporation adopted FASB Statement No. 109, "Accounting for
Income Taxes," at the beginning of 1993. Since the effect of adopting the new
Statement was not significant, prior year financial statements have not been
restated.

Earnings Per Share: Primary earnings per share are computed by dividing net
income, after deducting preferred dividends, by the weighted average number of
common shares outstanding. Fully diluted earnings per share assume the
conversion of preferred stock and the exercise of stock options that have a
dilutive effect.

NOTE B - ACQUISITIONS

In December 1993, the Corporation acquired the principal operating assets of
Central Corsetera, S.A. for $17.6 million. During 1992, the Corporation
acquired the common stock of The Valero Group (Valero), Vives Vidal, S.A.
(Vivesa) and Jean Bellanger Enterprises (JBE) for an aggregate purchase price
of $150.9 million. These companies manufacture and market branded intimate
apparel primarily in France and Spain.

In 1991, the Corporation acquired the principal operating assets of Healthtex
childrenswear, Barbizon intimate apparel and WorkWear occupational apparel for
an aggregate purchase price of $60.2 million.

All acquisitions have been accounted for as purchases, and accordingly,
operating results of these companies have been included in the consolidated
financial statements since the dates of acquisition.

In January 1994, the Corporation acquired the common stock of H.H. Cutler
Company for $154.7 million. Also in January 1994, the Corporation acquired the
common stock of Nutmeg Industries, Inc. for $352.2 million. Both companies
manufacture and market licensed sports apparel.

The scheduled payments of long-term debt are $2.6 million in 1995, $102.2
million in 1996, $1.8 million in 1997 and $.7 million in 1998. The 1997 notes
were called for redemption in January 1994 and, accordingly, are classified as
a current obligation. The Corporation paid interest of $70.3 million in 1993,
$68.1 million in 1992 and $65.2 million in 1991.

The Corporation maintains unsecured revolving credit agreements with banks
totaling $750 million, which support commercial paper borrowings and are
otherwise available for general corporate purposes. One of these agreements,
which provides $250 million of the total available credit, requires a
commitment fee of .125% and expires in October 1994 with  a one year term loan
option. The agreement that provides the remaining $500 million of credit
requires an .18% fee on the unused portion and extends to October 1997. At
January 1, 1994, there were no borrowings under these agreements. Borrowings
at the end of 1992 totaled $320.0 million, which were reduced by $231.9 million
in January 1993 with proceeds from the sale of VF Common Stock.

The fair value of the Corporation's long-term debt exceeded its recorded amount
by $51.8 million at January 1, 1994 and by $38.0 million at January 2, 1993.
The fair value of the Corporation's short-term borrowings approximates its
recorded amount. Fair value is based on quoted market prices or values of
comparable borrowings.

NOTE H - BENEFIT PLANS

The Corporation sponsors a noncontributory defined benefit pension plan
covering substantially all full-time domestic employees. Benefits are based on
employees' compensation and years of service. The Corporation annually
contributes amounts, as determined by an actuary, that provide the plan with
sufficient assets to meet future benefit payments. Plan assets consist
principally of common stocks, corporate obligations and U.S. government
obligations.

The effect of the defined benefit plan on income is as follows:

The projected benefit obligation was determined using an assumed discount rate
of 7.5% in 1993 and 9.0% in 1992 and 1991. The assumption for compensation
increases was 5.0% in 1993 and 5.5% in 1992 and 1991, and for return on plan
assets was 8.75% in 1993 and 1992 and 8.5% in 1991.

The Corporation also sponsors an Employee Stock Ownership Plan (ESOP) as part
of a 401(k) savings plan covering most domestic salaried employees.
Contributions made by the Corporation to the 401(k) plan are based on a
specified percentage of employee contributions. Cash contributions by the
Corporation were $4.5 million in 1993, $4.0 million in 1992 and $4.1 million in
1991. Plan expense was $6.0 million for 1993 and 1992 and $6.5 million for
1991, after giving effect to tax-deductible dividends on the Series B Preferred
Stock of $4.3 million in 1993 and 1992 and $4.4 million in 1991. In accordance
with FASB Statement No. 109, tax benefits on ESOP dividends are credited to
retained earnings beginning in 1993.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (CONTINUED)

NOTE I - CAPITAL

Common shares outstanding are net of shares held in treasury of 1,769,131 in
1993, 1,766,832 in 1992 and 1,702,891 in 1991. In January 1993, the Corporation
issued 4,600,000 shares of Common Stock in a public offering. The net proceeds
were used to repay borrowings incurred to purchase Valero, Vivesa and JBE. (See
Note B.)

There are 25,000,000 authorized shares of Preferred Stock, $1 par value. As of
January 1, 1994, 2,000,000 shares are designated as Series A Preferred Stock,
of which none have been issued. In addition, 2,105,263 shares are designated as
6.75% Series B Preferred Stock, which were purchased by the ESOP.

There were 2,050,491 shares of Series B Preferred Stock outstanding at January
1, 1994, 2,069,965 shares outstanding at January 2, 1993 and 2,090,597 shares
at January 4, 1992, after share redemptions.

Each outstanding share of Common Stock has one preferred stock purchase right
attached. The rights become exercisable ten days after an outside party
acquires, or makes an offer for, 20% or more of the Common Stock. Each right
entitles its holder to buy 1/100 share of Series A Preferred Stock for $100.
Once exercisable, if the Corporation is involved in a merger or other business
combination or an outside party acquires 20% or more of the Common Stock, each
right will be modified to entitle its holder (other than the acquiror) to
purchase common stock of the acquiring company or, in certain circumstances, VF
Common Stock having a market value of twice the exercise price of the right. In
some circumstances, rights other than those held by an acquiror may be
exchanged for one share of VF Common Stock or 1/100 share of Series A Preferred
Stock. The rights, which expire on January 13, 1998, may be redeemed at $.01
per right prior to their becoming exercisable.

NOTE J - REDEEMABLE PREFERRED STOCK

Each share of Series B Preferred Stock has a redemption value of $30.88 plus
cumulative accrued dividends, is convertible into 8/10 share of Common Stock
and is entitled to one vote per share along with the Common Stock. The trustee
for the ESOP may convert the preferred shares to Common Stock at any time or 
may cause the Corporation to redeem the preferred shares under certain 
circumstances. The Series B Preferred Stock also has preference in liquidation 
over all other stock issues.

The ESOP's purchase of the preferred shares was funded by a loan of $65.0
million from the Corporation that bears interest at 9.8% and is payable in
increasing installments through 2004. Interest related to this loan was $5.7
million in 1993, $6.0 million in 1992 and $6.2 million in 1991. Principal and
interest obligations on the loan are satisfied as the Corporation makes
contributions to the savings plan and dividends are paid on the Preferred
Stock. As principal payments are made on the loan, shares of Preferred Stock
are allocated to participating employees' accounts within the ESOP.

The fair value of the Series B Preferred Stock at January 1, 1994, based on a
valuation by an independent financial consulting firm, exceeds its recorded
amount by $12.4 million.

NOTE K - STOCK OPTIONS

The Corporation has granted nonqualified and incentive stock options under two
stock option plans at prices not less than fair market value on the date of
grant. Options become exercisable one year after the date of grant and expire
ten years after the date of grant unless otherwise specified by the Board of
Directors.

Changes in the status of the stock option plans are summarized as follows:

In December 1993, the Board of Directors adopted an amendment to the 1991 stock
option plan, subject to shareholder approval at the April 1994 Annual Meeting,
that would increase the number of shares available for future option grants by
three million shares. As of January 1, 1994, there are an additional 981,896
options that have been granted at $45.20 per share, subject to shareholder
approval of the increase in available shares.

Item 1.  Changes in the Plan

During 1991, two new investment programs were added (the Equity Growth Fund and
the Equity Growth & Income Fund), and one fund was eliminated (Equity Income
Fund).  The goal of the new Equity Growth Fund is capital appreciation.  This
Fund is primarily invested in common stock and securities convertible into
common stock, although a portion of the Fund's assets may be invested in debt
securities.  The Equity Growth and Income Fund replaced the Equity Income Fund
and places greater emphases on capital appreciation.  The goal of the Growth
and Income Fund is to seek long-term capital growth, current income and growth
of income consistent with reasonable investment risk.

Item 2.  Changes in Investment Policy

There have been no changes during the year in the policy with respect to the
kind of securities or other investments in which funds held under the Plan may
be invested.

Item 3.  Contributions Under the Plan

Contributions made by VF Corporation ("Corporation") are measured by
reference to the employee's contributions and are not discretionary.

Item 4.  Participating Employees

There were approximately 6,377 enrolled participants in the Plan as of
December 31, 1993, out of approximately 7,173 eligible employees.

Item 5.  Administration of the Plan

(a)   The Plan provides that a Committee of three persons be
      appointed to administer the Plan.  The Committee, the VF
      Corporation Pension Plan Committee, is comprised of the
      following officers of the Corporation:  Lori M.
      Tarnoski, Vice President and Secretary; Harold D.
      McKemy, Vice President - Treasury and Financial
      Services; and Harold E. Addis, Vice President - Human
      Resources and Administration.  All committee persons are
      located at the Corporation's headquarters:  1047 North
      Park Road, Wyomissing, PA  19610.  Each of these
      individuals is an employee of the Corporation and
      participates in the Plan.  The Committee has the power
      to adopt rules and regulations for carrying out and
      administering the Plan and has the full authority and
      power to construe, interpret and administer the Plan.
      Committee members receive no compensation from the Plan.
       
(b)   All expenses of administration of the Plan, including
      Trustee fees, are paid by the Corporation.

Item 6.  Custodian of Investments

(a)   The Corporation has entered into a Trust Agreement under
      which United Missouri Bank of Kansas City, N.A., 10th
      and Grand, P.O. Box 226, Kansas City, MO  64141, has
      been appointed as Trustee under the Plan.  Under the
      terms of the Trust Agreement, United Missouri Bank of
      Kansas City, N.A. holds and invests all assets of the
      Plan, subject to the direction of each of the
      participants of the Plan regarding the fund or funds to
      receive contributions.
      
(b)   The custodian's compensation is paid by the Corporation.
      
(c)   No bond was furnished or is required to be furnished by
      the Trustee.

Item 7.  Reports to Participating Employees

Each participant receives a quarterly statement showing the amounts contributed
by him/her to each of the funds during the calendar quarter and the market
values as of the end of each quarter.  The statement also shows the
Corporation's matching contributions allocated to the participant through the
Employee Stock Ownership Plan, which are invested in ESOP Preferred Stock, and
the fair values based on the preferred stock's stated redemption price of
$30.875 per share or 80% of the market value of the Corporation's Common Stock,
whichever is greater.

Item 8.  Investment of Funds

Each participant by written election directs the Trustee to invest his/her own
contributions in one or more of the following funds:
    
     - Money Market Fund
     - Fixed Income Fund
     - Equity Growth & Income Fund
     - Equity Growth Fund
     - VF Corporation Stock Fund (investing in common stock of the Corporation)

Brokerage commissions of $6,436, $6,166 and $6,852 for the years ended December
31, 1993, 1992 and 1991 were paid by the Trustee to acquire the Corporation's
common stock for the Plan.

The Corporation's matching contributions go solely to the ESOP.  These
contributions are allocated to participants who receive full value in the form
of ESOP Preferred Stock and are used by the ESOP to pay debt service on a loan
from the Corporation.

                         Report of Independent Auditors


VF Corporation Pension Plan Committee
VF Corporation Tax-Advantaged Savings
Plan for Salaried Employees


We have audited the accompanying statements of net assets available for
benefits of the VF Corporation Tax-Advantaged Savings Plan for Salaried
Employees as of December 31, 1993 and 1992, and the related statements of
changes in net assets available for benefits for each of the three years in the
period ended December 31, 1993.  These financial statements are the
responsibility of the Plan's management.  Our responsibility is to express an
opinion on these financial statements based on our audits.

We conducted our audits in accordance with generally accepted auditing
standards.  Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to
obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of
material misstatement.  An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence
supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements.  An audit
also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant
estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial
statement presentation.  We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis
for our opinion.

In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present fairly, in
all material respects, the net assets available for benefits of the VF
Corporation Tax-Advantaged Savings Plan for Salaried Employees at December 31,
1993 and 1992, and the changes in its net assets available for benefits for
each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 1993, in conformity
with generally accepted accounting principles.


                                                                   ERNST & YOUNG

       VF CORPORATION TAX-ADVANTAGED SAVINGS PLAN FOR SALARIED EMPLOYEES

                         NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS


NOTE A -- DESCRIPTION OF THE PLAN

Effective January 1, 1985, VF Corporation (the Corporation) adopted the VF
Corporation Tax-Advantaged Savings Plan for Salaried Employees (the Plan),
which is a cash or deferred plan under Section 401(k) of the Internal Revenue
Code.  Under the Plan, certain salaried employees of specified subsidiaries,
having at least one year of credited service, may elect to contribute between
2% and 8% of their compensation to the Plan.  The Corporation matches employee
contributions by 50% for up to 6% of compensation contributed by the employee.
Employees remain fully vested in their contributions to the Plan.  The
Corporation's matching contributions are vested monthly on a pro rata basis
with full vesting after five years of service or upon normal or late
retirement, disability or death.

Effective January 1990, the Corporation added an Employee Stock Ownership Plan
(ESOP) per an amendment to the Plan.  The ESOP purchased 2,105,263 shares of VF
Corporation 6.75% Series B ESOP Convertible Preferred Stock (ESOP Preferred
Stock) for $65.0 million.  Each share of ESOP Preferred Stock, which has a
redemption value of $30.88 plus cumulative accrued dividends, is convertible
into an eight-tenths share of VF Corporation Common Stock and is entitled to
one vote.  The trustee for the ESOP may convert the ESOP Preferred Stock to
Common Stock at any time or may cause the Corporation to redeem the ESOP
Preferred Stock under certain circumstances.  The ESOP Preferred Stock also has
preference in liquidation over all other stock issues.  The Corporation's
matching contributions, all of which go to the ESOP, are allocated to employees
in shares of ESOP Preferred Stock.  Of the shares of ESOP Preferred Stock owned
by the ESOP, 503,616 shares in 1993 and 375,834 shares in 1992 have been
allocated to employees.

The ESOP's purchase of the ESOP Preferred Stock was funded by a loan of $65.0
million from the Corporation that bears interest at 9.8%.  The obligation will
be repaid in increasing installments through 2004 from future Corporation
matching contributions to the ESOP and dividends on the ESOP Preferred Stock.

Effective January 1, 1992, the Plan was amended to exclude certain highly
compensated employees, (Salary Grade 20 and above).  Highly compensated
employees have not been permitted to make contributions to the plan since
December 31, 1991 but have continued to direct the investment of their Plan
account balances.

Employee contributions are invested at the direction of the employee in one or
more of the funds administered by the Plan's trustee.  The investment programs
of the Plan are as follows:

        (a)      Money Market Fund:  Monies are invested in a money market fund.

        (b)      Fixed Income Fund:  Monies are invested in investment vehicles
                 that provide a fixed rate of return.

        (c)      Equity Growth & Income Fund:  Monies are invested in
                 investments with emphasis on capital appreciation.

        (d)      Equity Growth Fund:  Monies are primarily invested in common
                 stock, securities convertible into common stock and debt 
                 securities.

        (e)      VF Corporation Stock Fund:  Monies are invested in
                 Common Stock of the Corporation purchased on the open
                 market at prevailing prices on the New York Stock
                 Exchange on the date of purchase.  Employees can
                 direct no more than 50% of their contributions to the
                 VF Corporation Stock Fund.

NOTE A -- DESCRIPTION OF THE PLAN (Continued)

Individual accounts are maintained for each participant; each account included
the individual's contributions, Corporation matching contributions and
investment funds' earnings.  Accounts may become payable upon retirement,
disability, death or termination of employment.  Participants may also withdraw
all or a portion of their accounts by filing a written request that
demonstrates financial hardship.  Participants may elect to receive
distributions in a lump sum or in an annuity, or accounts may be rolled over
into another IRS-approved tax deferral vehicle.  Forfeitures of terminated
participants' nonvested accounts are used to reduce Corporation contributions.

Participants may borrow from their individual account.  They are charged
interest at the Morgan Guaranty "Published" prime rate at the time of the loan
and repay the principal within 60 months, or 120 months if the loan is for the
purchase of their primary residence.  Participants may borrow up to 100% of the
Money Market Fund and 75% of remaining funds but may not borrow from the
Corporation matching portion.  Payment in full is required at termination of
employment.  There were 1,273 loans outstanding at December 31, 1993.

Although it has no intent to do so, the Corporation may terminate the Plan in
whole or in part at any time.  In the event of termination, participants become
fully vested in their accounts.



The number of participants in each fund was as follows:

NOTE B -- SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

Investments are stated at fair value.  Securities traded on a national
securities exchange are valued at the last reported sales price on the last
business day of the plan year.  The ESOP Preferred Stock is stated at fair
value, based on the greater of 80% of the fair value of the Corporation's
common stock or the preferred stock's stated redemption price.  United States
government obligations are valued at cost, which approximates market.  For
commercial notes, the Plan trustee has established a fair value based on yields
currently available on comparable instruments.  The fair value of the
participation units owned by the Plan in mutual funds and bank common trust
funds is based on quoted redemption values on the last business day of the plan
year.  Unallocated insurance contracts are valued at contract values as
estimated by the insurer.  Contract value represents contributions made under
the contract, plus interest at the contract rate, less funds used to pay the
insurance company's administrative expenses.


The changes in the difference between fair value and cost of investments are
reflected as unrealized appreciation or depreciation in fair value of
investments in the statements of changes in net assets available for benefits.

In determining the realized gain or loss on investments sold, the cost of
investments has been determined on the average cost basis for marketable
securities and on the identified cost basis for mutual funds and bank common
trust funds, commercial notes and unallocated insurance contracts.

Administrative expenses consisting primarily of fees paid for legal, accounting
and other services are paid directly by the Corporation in accordance with the
Plan Agreement and are based on customary and reasonable rates for such
services.

NOTE C -- INCOME TAXES

The Internal Revenue Service has determined and informed the Company by a
letter dated May 12, 1987 that the Plan is qualified and the trust established
under the Plan is tax-exempt under the appropriate sections of the Code.  The
Plan Administrator does not anticipate that changes in the Plan after the date
of the amendments covered by the Internal Revenue Service determination letter
will affect the qualified and tax-exempt status of the Plan and the Trust,
respectively.
