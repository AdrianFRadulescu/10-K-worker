                           29, 1982, as  supplemented on March 5, 1982, June 21,
                           1982 and August 27, 1982 (the "Prospectus")





















                                     PART I

Item 1.           Business.

Development.

         Winthrop Residential Associates II ("WRA II"), was originally organized
under the Uniform  Limited  Partnership  Act of the State of Maryland on October
21, 1981, for the purpose of investing,  as a limited partner,  in other limited
partnerships which would develop,  manage,  own, operate and otherwise deal with
apartment  complexes,  the financing of which are assisted by federal,  state or
local government  agencies ("Local Limited  Partnerships")  pursuant to programs
which do not  significantly  restrict  distributions  to  owners or the rates of
return on  investments in such  properties.  On June 23, 1983, WRA II elected to
comply with and be governed by the Maryland Revised Uniform Limited  Partnership
Act (the "Act") and filed its Agreement and  Certificate of Limited  Partnership
(the "Partnership  Agreement") with the Maryland State Department of Assessments
and Taxation.  In  accordance  with and upon filing its  Certificate  of Limited
Partnership pursuant to the Act, WRA II changed its name to Winthrop Residential
Associates II, A Limited Partnership (the "Partnership").

         The general  partners of the Partnership  are One Winthrop  Properties,
Inc., a  Massachusetts  corporation  ("One  Winthrop"),  and  Linnaeus-Hawthorne
Associates  Limited  Partnership  ("Linnaeus-  Hawthorne").  One  Winthrop  is a
wholly-owned subsidiary of First Winthrop Corporation ("First Winthrop"),  which
in turn is wholly-owned by Winthrop Financial Associates,  A Limited Partnership
("WFA"),   a  Maryland   public  limited   partnership.   One  Winthrop  is  the
Partnership's managing general partner. See "Change in Control."

         The Partnership was initially  capitalized with contributions  totaling
$2,000 from its two General Partners and with  contributions of $5,000 from each
of the two Initial Limited Partners.

         In late 1981, the  Partnership  filed a Registration  Statement on Form
S-11 with the  Securities  and  Exchange  Commission  with  respect  to a public
offering of 25,000 Units of limited partnership interest ("Units") at a purchase
price of $1,000 per



<PAGE>









Unit (an  aggregate of  $25,000,000).  The  Registration  Statement was declared
effective on January 29, 1982. The offering  terminated on November 17, 1982, at
which time  25,000  Units,  representing  capital  contributions  from  Investor
Limited Partners of $25,000,000, had been subscribed for. Capital contributions,
net of selling  commissions,  sales and  registration  costs,  were  utilized to
purchase  interests in 10 Local Limited  Partnerships  and temporary  short term
investments.

Description of Business.

         The only business of the  Partnership is investing as a limited partner
in Local  Limited  Partnerships  that  own,  operate  and  otherwise  deal  with
apartment complexes with financing insured by the U.S. Department of Housing and
Urban Development ("HUD"). The Partnership's  investment objectives and policies
are  described  at pages  23-29 of its  Prospectus  dated  January 29, 1982 (the
"Prospectus")  under the caption  "Investment  Objectives and  Policies,"  which
description  is attached  hereto as an exhibit and  incorporated  herein by this
reference.  The Prospectus was previously filed with the Commission  pursuant to
Rule 424(b).

         Initially, the Partnership acquired equity interests ranging from 52.8%
to 99% in ten Local Limited Partnerships, owning 12 properties, for an aggregate
investment,  including  capitalizable and noncapitalizable fees and expenses, of
approximately $21,669,334. One of the Partnership's properties was sold in 1986.

         The  Partnership has invested in Local Limited  Partnerships  which own
properties located in diverse markets with respect to both the amount and nature
of competition affecting the properties. Some of the rental markets first became
overbuilt during the mid-1980's.  Supply of apartments  available for rent began
to exceed demand and consumers became very price sensitive.
 In order to attract  tenants,  certain  properties  were  required  to maintain
rental rates rather than increase them to meet  increasing  costs.  As a result,
these properties were forced to defer  maintenance and  replacements  which were
necessary to attract tenants,  thus exacerbating the competitive  forces at work
in these markets.  The following table sets forth  information  regarding the 11
properties owned by the nine Local Limited Partnerships in which the Partnership
continues to hold an interest.

1982; at pages 1-22 of the Supplement to the Prospectus dated June 21, 1982; and
at pages 1-48 of the Supplement to the Prospectus  dated August 27, 1982, all of
which descriptions are attached hereto as an exhibit and incorporated  herein by
this  reference.  The three  Supplements to the  Prospectus  were filed with the
Commission  pursuant to Rule 424(c) and as Post-Effective  Amendments Nos. 1, 2,
and 3, respectively,  to the Partnership's  Registration  Statement on Form S-11
(Registration  No.  2-74784).  See also  "Item 7,  Management's  Discussion  and
Analysis  of  Financial  Condition  and  Results  of  Operations,"  and "Item 8,
Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, Note 4" for additional  information
concerning the properties.

Defaults

      The  Partnership  holds  limited  partnership  interests in Local  Limited
Partnerships  which  own  apartment  properties,  all of which  were  originally
financed  with  HUD-insured  first  mortgages.  If a Local  Limited  Partnership
defaults on a  HUD-insured  mortgage,  the  mortgagee  can assign the  defaulted
mortgage to HUD and recover the principal  owed on its first  mortgage from HUD.
HUD, in its discretion,  may then either (i) negotiate a workout  agreement with
the Local Limited Partnership, (ii) sell the mortgage, or (iii) pursue its right
to transfer the ownership of the property from the Local Limited  Partnership to
HUD through a foreclosure  action.  The objective of a workout agreement between
an owner and HUD is to secure HUD's  sanction of a plan which,  over time,  will
cure any mortgage delinquencies.  While a workout agreement is effective and its
terms are being met, HUD agrees not to pursue any remedies  available to it as a
result of the default.

     The Partnership holds ownership  interests in one Local Limited Partnership
which is in default on its mortgage  obligation.  The Local Limited Partnership,
Southwest Parkway, is attempting to secure a workout agreement with HUD.

      In April  1995,  the Local  Limited  Partnership  owning  Sanford  Landing
negotiated a workout  agreement  with HUD pursuant to which the interest rate on
the debt was  reduced so that the debt  service  payments  are at a  serviceable
level based on the property's  current cash flow. In addition,  a portion of the
mortgage  was  reassigned  to the  original  mortgagee.  The  remaining  balance
continues to be held by HUD.



<PAGE>








      In March 1987,  the Local Limited  Partnership  owning  Southwest  Parkway
defaulted on its mortgage.  Since that time, the Local Limited  Partnership  has
submitted various  proposals to HUD to cure the mortgage  default,  all of which
have been rejected. The Partnership has been notified that this mortgage will be
included in an auction to be held in 1996.  The  Partnership  will  continue its
efforts to negotiate a workout  agreement.  The Local Limited  Partnership sends
any net cash flow to HUD in partial satisfaction of its mortgage obligation.

Change in Control

         On December 22, 1994, pursuant to an Investment  Agreement entered into
among Nomura Asset Capital Corporation  ("NACC"),  Arthur J. Halleran,  Jr., the
sole general partner of Linnaeus  Associates Limited  Partnership  ("Linnaeus"),
the sole general partner of WFA, Mr. Halleran and certain other  individuals who
comprised the senior  management  of WFA,  transferred  the general  partnership
interest in Linnaeus to W.L.  Realty,  L.P.  ("W.L.  Realty").  W.L. Realty is a
Delaware limited  partnership,  the general partner of which was, until July 18,
1995,  A.I.  Realty  Company,  LLC  ("Realtyco"),  an  entity  owned by  certain
employees  of  NACC.  On  July  18,  1995  Londonderry  Acquisition  II  Limited
Partnership (Londonderry II"), a Delaware limited partnership,  and affiliate of
Apollo Real Estate  Advisors,  L.P.  ("Apollo"),  acquired,  among other things,
Realtyco's  general  partner  interest in W.L.  Realty and a sixty four  percent
(64%) limited  partnership  interest in W.L. Realty, and the general partnership
interest in Linneaus-Hampshire.

      As a result  of the  foregoing  acquisitions,  Londonderry  II is the sole
general  partner of W.L.  Realty which is the sole general  partner of Linnaeus,
which in turn is the sole general  partner of WFA. As a result of the foregoing,
effective  July 18, 1995,  Londonderry  II, an  affiliate of Apollo,  became the
controlling  entity of the General Partners.  In connection with the transfer of
control,  the officers and directors of One Winthrop resigned and Londonderry II
appointed  new officers and  directors.  See Item 10,  "Directors  and Executive
Officers of Registrant.

Employees

      The  Partnership  does not have any employees.  Services are performed for
the  Partnership by the Managing  General  Partner,  and agents  retained by it,
including an affiliate of the Managing General Partner, WP Management Co., Inc.

Item 2. Properties.

      Other than the limited  partnership  interests  set forth in Item 1 above,
the Partnership does not own any property.

Item 3.  Legal Proceedings.

      The  Partnership is not a party nor are any of its  properties  subject to
any material pending legal proceedings.

Item 4.  Submission of Matters to a Vote of Security Holders.

         No matter was submitted to a vote of security holders during the period
covered by this report.

                                                      PART II

Item 5.  Market for the Registrant's Common Stock and Related
               Stockholder Matters.

      The Registrant is a partnership and thus has no common stock.  There is no
active market for the Units.  Trading in the Units is sporadic and occurs solely
through private transactions.

      As of December 31, 1995, there were 2,589 holders of Units.

     The  Partnership  Agreement  requires  that  if the  Partnership  has  Cash
Available  for  Distribution,  it be  distributed  quarterly  to the Partners in
specified  proportions.  The  Partnership  Agreement  defines Cash Available for
Distribution as Cash Flow less cash  designated by the Managing  General Partner
to be held for  restoration  or creation of  reserves.  Cash Flow,  in turn,  is
defined as cash derived from the Local Limited  Partnerships (but excluding sale
or refinancing proceeds) and all cash derived from Partnership operations,  less
cash used to pay  operating  expenses  of the  Partnership.  For the years ended
December 31, 1995 and 1994, cash  distributions  paid or accrued to the Investor
Limited

Partners as a group totaled $300,000 and $200,000, respectively.

          As of March 15, 1996, the  Partnership  retained an equity interest in
nine Local Limited Partnerships owning 11 apartment properties.  The Partnership
follows the equity method of accounting  for these  interests and recognizes its
proportionate  share  of  income  and  losses  incurred  by  the  Local  Limited
Partnerships.  With the  exception  of  1990,  the  recognition  of  losses  has
decreased due to two factors.  First, certain properties have reached break even
or profitable  operations.  Second,  losses which would cause the  Partnership's
investment  account in a Local Limited  Partnership  to become  negative are not
recognized  since the  Partnership  has no obligation to fund them. In 1995, the
recognition  of losses  increased  due to an  increase  in losses  for the Local
Limited  Partnerships in which the Partnership's  investment  accounts were at a
sufficient level for recognition of losses. At December 31, 1991, all investment
accounts had zero balances.  For fiscal 1995, the Partnership's  share of losses
of $1,643,103 from the nine Local Limited Partnerships were deferred as required
by the equity method.  Cumulatively  through 1995, a total of $19,817,153 of the
Partnership's  equity in losses from the Local  Limited  Partnerships  have been
deferred. The equity method of accounting is used solely for financial reporting
purposes;  all losses continue to be recognized for tax purposes. The tax losses
of the Partnership will decrease over time because the advantages of accelerated
depreciation taken by the Local Limited Partnerships are greatest in the earlier
years. Also, the deductions for mortgage interest expense will steadily decrease
as the mortgage principals are amortized.

          The  Partnership  requires cash to pay its general and  administrative
expenses or to make contributions to any of the Local Limited Partnerships which
the Managing General Partner deems to be in the  Partnership's  best interest to
preserve  its  ownership  interest.  To date,  all cash  requirements  have been
satisfied  by  interest  income  earned  on  short-term   investments  and  cash
distributed  to  the  Partnership  by the  Local  Limited  Partnerships.  If the
Partnership funds any operating deficits,  it will use monies from its operating
reserves. As of December 31, 1995, the Partnership held operating reserves of




<PAGE>



approximately  $1,981,000  which  is  expected  to be  sufficient  to  fund  any
anticipated  deficits.  The  Managing  General  Partner's  current  policy is to
maintain a reserve balance sufficient to provide, at a minimum,  interest income
in an  amount  equal to the  Partnership's  annual  general  and  administrative
expenses.   Therefore,   a  lack  of  cash  distributed  by  the  Local  Limited
Partnerships  to the  Partnership  in the future will not deplete the  reserves,
though it may restrict the Partnership from making distributions.

          The Partnership  has reserves  which,  in principal,  could be used to
make contributions to the Local Limited  Partnerships.  However, the Partnership
does not  intend  to make  contributions  in order to fund any  possible  future
operating deficits incurred by the Local Limited  Partnerships,  but retains its
prerogative  to  exercise  a  business  judgment  to reverse  this  position  if
circumstances warrant a change in this policy.  Moreover, the Partnership is not
obligated to provide any additional  funds to the Local Limited  Partnerships to
fund operating  deficits.  If a Local Limited  Partnership  sustains  continuing
operating  deficits  and has no other  source of funding,  it is likely that the
Local Limited Partnership will eventually default on its mortgage obligation and
risk a  foreclosure  on its  property by the lender.  If a  foreclosure  were to
occur, the Local Limited  Partnership  would lose its investment in the property
and would incur a tax liability  due to the  recapture of tax benefits  taken in
prior years.  The  Partnership,  as an owner of the Local Limited  Partnerships,
would share these  consequences  in proportion to its ownership  interest in the
Local Limited Partnerships.

Results of Operations

          A number of the properties owned by the Local Limited  Partnerships in
which the Partnership has invested have operated at a deficit for many years due
to their  location in areas with weak  economies  or overbuilt  rental  markets.
Economic and competitive  forces also impede properties  operating at break even
or better to improve their financial  results,  that is, to generate  increasing
net cash flow in each  subsequent  year after  operating  expenses and financial
obligations.  As markets  deteriorated during the mid-1980's,  the Local Limited
Partnerships  experiencing  financial difficulties sought alternative sources of
funding  to  cover  operating  deficits.  In some  cases,  these  Local  Limited
Partnerships  secured additional funding from their general partners.  From 1984
through  1987,  the  Partnership  did provide some funding to two Local  Limited
Partnerships to preserve its ownership interest in those properties. However, as
it became  apparent  that the recovery of these  markets  would be prolonged and
that  the  Partnership's  resources  were  limited,  funding  was  discontinued.
Consequently,  some Local Limited  Partnerships  incurring  continuing  deficits
ceased making full debt service  payments,  putting the mortgages  into default,
and instead  began  negotiating  with HUD for workout  agreements to reduce debt
service payments to a level property operations could support.

          One Local  Limited  Partnership,  Southwest  Parkway,  is currently in
default on its mortgage  obligation.  Southwest Parkway has also been attempting
to  secure a  workout  agreement  with HUD since it  defaulted  on its  mortgage
obligation in March 1987. Due to Southwest Parkway's financial situation, it was
unable to make cash distributions to the Partnership in 1993, 1994 and 1995.

          Sanford Landing,  which had previously been in default on its mortgage
obligation,  negotiated  a  workout  agreement  with HUD  pursuant  to which the
interest rate was reduced so that the debt service payments are at a serviceable
level based on the property's current cash flow.

          The other nine  properties  owned by the remaining seven Local Limited
Partnerships met their financial obligations during 1995.

          Brookside  operated  at  break  even  in  1995.  Accordingly,  no cash
distribution  will be made to the Partnership in 1996.  Brookside  operated at a
deficit in 1994 and 1993,  precluding it from making cash  distributions  to the
Partnership in 1995 and 1994, respectively.

          Wedgewood Creek operated  incurred an operating  deficit in 1995 which
was funded by extending  payables and will not be making a cash  distribution to
the Partnership in 1996.  Wedgewood Creek was unable to make cash  distributions
to the Partnership in 1995 and 1994 as well because it operated at break even in
1994 and at a deficit in 1993.

          Mountain Vista II generated positive cash flow in 1995 and made a cash
distribution  of $73,125 to the  Partnership  in 1995.  While  Mountain Vista II
operated   slightly  above  a  break-even  level  in  1994  and  1993,  no  cash
distributions were made to the Partnership.

          Westbury  Springs has generated  positive cash flow in 1995,  1994 and
1993 which has been used to reduce a note payable.

          Mountain Vista I generated  positive cash flow in 1995 and made a cash
distribution  of  $73,125  to the  Partnership  in 1995.  Mountain  Vista I also
generated  positive cash flow in 1994 and 1993 and made a cash  distribution  of
$67,500 to the Partnership in 1994.

          Cibola generated  positive cash flow in 1995, 1994 and 1995 and made a
cash  distribution of $146,250 and $135,000 to the Partnership in 1995 and 1994,
respectively.

          Honeywood made cash distributions totaling $166,748 to the Partnership
in 1995, representing cash flow generated during the second half of 1994 and the
first half of 1995. It is anticipated  that cash  distributions  will be made to
the Partnership in 1996 from cash flow generated  during the second half of 1995
and the first half of 1996. A total of $90,044 was  received by the  Partnership
in 1994  representing cash flow generated during the second half of 1993 and the
first half of 1994.

     Crofton made cash  distributions  totaling  $241,368 to the  Partnership in
1995,  representing  cash flow generated  during the second half of 1994 and the
first half of 1995. It is anticipated  that cash  distributions  will be made to
the Partnership in 1996 from cash flow generated  during the second half of 1995
and the first half of 1996. A total of $144,555 was received by the  Partnership
in 1994  representing cash flow generated during the second half of 1993 and the
first half of 1994.

          Whisper  Lake  operated at break even in 1995 and will not be making a
cash  distribution to the  Partnership in 1996.  Whisper Lake was unable to make
cash  distributions  to the  Partnership  in 1995  and 1994 as well  because  it
operated at a deficit in 1994 and 1993.

          The Local Limited  Partnerships'  objectives are to improve  operating
results for all properties and obtain  workout  agreements for those  properties
that are in default on their mortgage obligations. The Partnership believes that
as long as the Local  Limited  Partnership  which owns the  property  in default
continues  to negotiate  with HUD to work out its  financial  difficulties,  the
threat of foreclosure is mitigated. Moreover, any workout agreement entered into
between  HUD and the  Local  Limited  Partnerships  will  have no  effect on the
Partnership's  ability to deduct mortgage  interest expense unless HUD agrees to
forgive such  interest  indebtedness.  As of March 15,  1996,  none of the Local
Limited  Partnerships  had  agreements  with HUD  which  would  forgive  accrued
interest.

     The results of operations for future years may differ from those in 1995 as
a  result  of  many  factors.  One  will be the  ability  of the  Local  Limited
Partnerships  which owns a  property  in  default  on its  mortgage  obligations
(Southwest Parkway) to negotiate a workout agreement with HUD to modify its debt
service  requirements.  Another factor will be the ability of each Local Limited
Partnership  to deal with  consequences  of changing  economic  conditions  that
affect  property  operations.  The  Partnership's  investment  in Local  Limited
Partnerships  owning rental real estate is subject to the risk involved with the
management and ownership of rental real estate.  Vacancy  level,  rental payment
defaults and operating  expenses are all dependent on general and local economic
conditions.  Shifts in the economy could result in differing  operating  results
for each  individual  Local Limited  Partnership.  In these  markets,  operating
results  in future  years may  depend on the  properties'  ability  to  maintain
competitive  rental rates while using its available  resources to fund necessary
repairs and replacements.

          The Partnership's plan is to work with the Local Limited  Partnerships
to maintain  ownership of and seek a workout agreement with HUD for the property
in default on its mortgage.  Although the  Partnership has no ability to force a
sale of properties owned by the Local Limited Partnerships, the Partnership will
also work with the Local Limited  Partnerships to investigate sale opportunities
and will  continue to work with the Local  Limited  Partnerships  to improve the
financial performance of all the properties.

                    REPORT OF INDEPENDENT PUBLIC ACCOUNTANTS


To WINTHROP RESIDENTIAL ASSOCIATES II, A LIMITED PARTNERSHIP:

We  have  audited  the  accompanying  balance  sheets  of  WINTHROP  RESIDENTIAL
ASSOCIATES II, A LIMITED  PARTNERSHIP  (a Maryland  limited  partnership)  as of
December 31, 1995 and 1994, and the related statements of operations, changes in
partners' capital and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended
December 31, 1995. These financial statements and the schedule referred to below
are the responsibility of the Partnership's management. Our responsibility is to
express an opinion  on these  financial  statements  and  schedule  based on our
audits.  We did not audit the  financial  statments  of  certain  Local  Limited
Partnerships,  the  investments  in  which  are  reflected  in the  accompanying
financial statements using the equity method of accounting and were written down
to zero (see note 2).  Those  statements  were audited by other  auditors  whose
reports have been  furnished to us, and our opinion,  in so far as it relates to
the amounts  included for those Local Limited  Partnerships,  is based solely on
the reports or the other auditors.

We  conducted  our  audits  in  accordance  with  generally   accepted  auditing
standards.  Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material
misstatement.  An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting
the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements.  An audit also includes
assessing the  accounting  principles  used and  significant  estimates  made by
management,  as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation.
We  believe  that our  audits  and the  reports  of  other  auditors  provide  a
reasonable basis for our opinion.

In our  opinion  based on our audits  and the  reports  of other  auditors,  the
financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects,
the  financial  position  of  WINTHROP  RESIDENTIAL  ASSOCIATES  II,  A  LIMITED
PARTNERSHIP  as of December 31, 1995 and 1994, and the results of its operations
and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended  December 31,
1995, in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles.

Our  audits  were  made for the  purpose  of  forming  an  opinion  on the basic
financial statements taken as a whole.  Schedule III, listed in the index to the
financial statements,  is the responsibility of WINTHROP RESIDENTIAL  ASSOCIATES
II, A LIMITED PARTNERSHIP  management and is presented for purposes of complying
with the Securities and Exchange  Commission's  rules and is not a required part
of the basic  financial  statements.  This  schedule  has been  subjected to the
auditing procedures applied in our audits of the basic financial statements and,
in our opinion,  fairly  states in all material  respects,  the  financial  data
required to be set forth therein in relation to the basic  financial  statements
taken as a whole.

NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
December 31, 1995

1.         ORGANIZATION

Winthrop  Residential  Associates II, A Limited  Partnership (the "Partnership")
was organized on October 21, 1981 under the Uniform  Limited  Partnership Act of
the State of Maryland  to invest in limited  partnerships  (the  "Local  Limited
Partnerships") which develop,  manage,  operate and otherwise deal in government
assisted apartment complexes that do not significantly restrict distributions to
owners or the rate of  return on  investments  in such  properties.  On June 23,
1983,  the  Partnership  elected to comply with and be governed by the  Maryland
Revised  Uniform  Limited  Partnership  Act. The  Partnership  will terminate on
December 31, 2031 or sooner,  in  accordance  with the terms of the  Partnership
agreement.

2.         SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

Financial  Statements - The financial statements of the Partnership are prepared
on the accrual basis of accounting.

Cash and cash  equivalents - Cash and cash  equivalents  consist of money market
mutual  funds that  invest in  treasury  bills and  repurchase  agreements  with
original  maturities  of three months or less.  Cash  equivalents  are valued at
cost, which approximates market value.

Use of Estimates - The  preparation of financial  statements in conformity  with
generally accepted  accounting  principles requires management to make estimates
and assumptions  that affect the reported  amounts of assets and liabilities and
disclosure of  contingent  assets and  liabilities  at the date of the financial
statements  and the  reported  amounts  of  revenues  and  expenses  during  the
reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates.

Income  Taxes - No provision  has been made for  federal,  state or local income
taxes in the financial  statements of the Partnership.  Partners are required to
report on their  individual tax returns their allocable share of income,  gains,
losses, deductions and credits of the Partnership. The Partnership files its tax
returns on the accrual basis. On January 29, 1982, the Internal  Revenue Service
issued a ruling that the  Partnership  will be classified  as a partnership  for
federal income tax purposes.

Investments  in Local Limited  Partnerships - The  Partnership  accounts for its
investment in each Local Limited Partnership using the equity method.  Under the
equity method of accounting,  the  investment  cost  (including  amounts paid or
accrued)  is  subsequently  adjusted  by the  Partnership's  share of the  Local
Limited  Partnership's  results of operations and by  distributions  received or
accrued.  Equity in the loss of Local Limited  Partnerships is not recognized to
the extent that the investment balance would become negative, as the Partnership
has no obligation to fund the losses of the Local Limited Partnerships.

Distributions  to  Partners  -  Cash   distributions   from  the  Local  Limited
Partnerships are included in the computation of the Partnership's cash available
for  distribution  in the quarter  received.  As provided for in the Partnership
agreement,  quarterly  distributions  are payable to the Partners within 60 days
after the end of the quarter.

2.         SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (CONT'D)

On April 1, 1985, the Managing  General  Partner  determined  that the operating
reserves of the Partnership  were not  sufficiently  funded.  Accordingly,  from
April 1, 1985 to December 31, 1990, the Partnership had retained cash that would
otherwise have been available for  distribution  as additional  reserves to fund
operating deficits of certain Local Limited Partnerships. Beginning in 1991, the
Managing General Partner determined that cash  distributions  would be made on a
quarterly basis. The Partnership paid or accrued  approximately  $300,000 to the
Investor Limited Partners in 1995 and approximately $200,000 in 1994 and 1993.

3.         TRANSACTIONS WITH RELATED PARTIES

One Winthrop Properties, Inc. ("One Winthrop"); the Managing General Partner,
WP Management Co., Inc. ("WP Management"), the manager of the Partnership's
investments in the Local Limited Partnerships; and Winthrop Financial Co.,
Inc. ("Winthrop Financial") are wholly owned subsidiaries of First Winthrop
Corporation, which, in turn, is wholly owned by Winthrop Financial Associates,
A Limited Partnership ("WFA").

WP  Management  is entitled  to a fee for  services  rendered  in  managing  the
Partnership's  investments in the Local Limited Partnerships equal to 10% of the
Partnership's  share of cash distributions from the Local Limited  Partnerships,
not to  exceed  1/2 of 1% of the  sum of (a)  the  amount  of the  Partnership's
aggregate  total  investment  in all Local  Limited  Partnerships,  plus (b) the
Partnership's allocable share of all liens and mortgages secured by the projects
of all Local Limited Partnerships. The fee is noncumulative and commences at the
closing of each Local Limited Partnership's  permanent loan. For the years ended
December 31, 1995,  1994 and 1993, WP  Management  earned  $76,812,  $39,210 and
$18,825,  respectively,  for managing the Partnership's investments in the Local
Limited Partnerships.

An  affiliate  of WFA has an equity  interest  in a  partnership  that has a 42%
limited  partnership  interest  in one of the  Local  Limited  Partnerships.  In
addition,  an affiliate of WFA acquired a general partner interest in one of the
Local Limited  Partnerships in 1986 and remains the Managing  General Partner in
one other Local Limited Partnership.

The General Partners are entitled to 5% of cash available for distribution.  The
General  Partners  were  entitled  to  $15,796,  $10,532  and  $10,532  of  cash
distributions in 1995, 1994 and 1993, respectively.

During the liquidation stage of the Partnership,  the General Partners and their
affiliates  are  entitled  to receive  certain  distributions,  subordinated  to
specified   minimum  returns  to  the  Limited  Partners  as  described  in  the
Partnership agreement.

4.         INVESTMENTS IN LOCAL LIMITED PARTNERSHIPS

As of  December  31,  1995,  the  Partnership  had  limited  partnership  equity
interests  in  nine  Local  Limited  Partnerships.   These  nine  Local  Limited
Partnerships, which own 11 fully operating apartment complexes, have outstanding
mortgages   totaling   $59,892,745  which  are  secured  by  the  Local  Limited
Partnerships' real property,  security interests,  liens and endorsements common
to first mortgage loans.

The  Partnership  has not  made  additional  investments  in any  Local  Limited
Partnerships  during 1995 but had cumulatively  contributed  $942,992 in several
Local  Limited  Partnerships.  These  investments  had  been  accounted  for  as
operating deficit advances by the Local Limited Partnerships.

The  investments in Local Limited  Partnerships  balance as of December 31, 1995
and 1994 are as follows:

5.      TAX LOSS

The  Partnership's  tax loss for 1995 differs from the net income for  financial
reporting purposes primarily due to accounting differences in the recognition of
depreciation   incurred  by  the  Local  Limited  Partnerships  and  losses  not
recognizable under the equity method. The taxable loss for 1995 is as follows:

6.      LOCAL LIMITED PARTNERSHIPS

In 1993, the Department of Housing and Urban  Development  (HUD) issued a letter
indicating its intention to initiate foreclosure proceedings on Sanford Landing.
Subsequently,  the Local  Limited  Partnership  submitted a workout  proposal in
order to  avoid  foreclosure.  The  Local  Limited  Partnership  owning  Sanford
Landing,  and  HUD  have  agreed  to  terms  in  1995.  Pursuant  to a  mortgage
modification  agreement  effective May 12, 1995, the outstanding  first mortgage
principal  balance was reduced.  Concurrently,  a second mortgage note was drawn
between the local limited  partnership and HUD. These  transactions  resulted in
the extinguishment of $863,044 of debt, and in recasting unpaid accrued interest
as second mortgage principal debt.

The Local Limited  Partnership  owning Southwest  Parkway has submitted  various
proposals to HUD, the latest in January 1995, to cure the mortgage  default.  In
October 1995, HUD notified the Local Limited  Partnership  that the mortgage has
been  preliminarily  selected  for sale in 1996.  Management  is  attempting  to
negotiate  a  provisional  workout  arrangement  with HUD,  and in the event the
mortgage is sold,  management  will attempt to  negotiate a workout  arrangement
with the new lender.

The  Partnership  is unable to  determine  at this time if these  Local  Limited
Partnerships will be able to meet their financing requirements during the coming
year. The  Partnership  is not obligated to fund operating  deficits or mortgage
loans of these Local Limited Partnerships.  The Partnership's investment balance
in these Local Limited Partnerships is zero at December 31, 1995.

Item 12.            Security Ownership of Certain Beneficial Owners and
                    Management.

          (a)  Security ownership of certain beneficial owners.

          The  General  Partners  own all the  outstanding  general  partnership
interests.  No person or group is known by the  Partnership to be the beneficial
owner of more than 5% of the outstanding  Units at December 31, 1995.  Under the
Partnership  Agreement,  the voting  rights of the Limited  Partners are limited
and, in some circumstances, are subject to the prior receipt of certain opinions
of counsel or judicial decisions.

          Under the Partnership  Agreement,  the right to manage the business of
the  Partnership  is vested  in the  General  Partners  and is  generally  to be
exercised only by the Managing General Partner, although approval of Linnaeus is
required as to all investments in Local Limited  Partnerships  and in connection
with any votes or  consents  arising  out of the  ownership  of a Local  Limited
Partnership interest.

          (b)  Security ownership of management.

          None of the  officers,  directors  or general  partners of the General
Partners and none of the partners of WFA owned any Units at December 31, 1995 in
individual capacities;  however, WFC Realty Co., Inc., a wholly owned subsidiary
of First  Winthrop,  (of which  certain  officers and  directors of the Managing
General Partner are officers or directors) owns 100 units (.38%).

          (c)  Changes in control.

          There exists no arrangement  known to the Partnership the operation of
which may at a subsequent  date result in a change in control of the Partnership
except as follows:

     In connection with its  acquisition of control of Linnaeus,  Londonderry II
issued  NACC a $22  million  non-recourse  purchase  money  note due  1998  (the
"Purchase Money Note"),  as set forth in a loan agreement,  dated as of July 14,
1995, by and between NACC and Londonderry II. Initial  security for the Purchase
Money Note  includes,  among other  things,  the  partnership  interests in W.L.
Realty  acquired by Londonderry II and the W.L. Realty  partnership  interest in
Linnaeus.  Accordingly, if Londonderry II does not satisfy its obligations under
the  Purchase  Money  Note,  NACC  would have the right to  foreclose  upon this
security and, as result, would gain control of the Partnership.


Item 13.  Certain Relationships and Related Transactions.

          The General  Partners  and their  affiliates  are  entitled to receive
various fees, commissions, cash distributions,  allocations of taxable income or
loss and expense  reimbursements  from the Partnership.  WP Management Co., Inc.
("WP Management"),  an affiliate of the Managing General Partner, is entitled to
a fee for services rendered in managing the  Partnership's  investments equal to
10% of the  Partnership's  share of cash  distributions  from the Local  Limited
Partnerships,  not to  exceed  1/2 of 1% of the  sum of (a)  the  amount  of the
Partnership's aggregate total investment in all Local Limited Partnerships, plus
(b) the Partnership's  allocable share of all liens and mortgages secured by the
projects  of all  Local  Limited  Partnerships.  The  fee is  noncumulative  and
commences at the closing of each Local Limited Partnership's permanent loan. For
the years ended December 31, 1995, 1994 and 1993, WP Management  earned $76,812,
$39,210 and $18,825, respectively.

          The  Partnership's  general  partners  are  entitled  to  5%  of  cash
available for distribution.  The general partners received $15,796,  $10,532 and
$10,532 of cash distributions in 1995, 1994 and 1993, respectively.

          For the year  ended  December  31,  1995,  the  Partnership  allocated
$23,451  of tax  losses to the  Managing  General  Partner  and  $39,085  to the
Associate General Partner.
