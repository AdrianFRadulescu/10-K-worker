To the Board of Directors
YES Clothing Co.



As independent accountants for YES Clothing Co., we have not yet formed our
opinion on the financial statements of the Company for the year ended March 31,
1995.  It is our understanding that the Company is expected to receive an
infusion of capital in early July, and that such capital is necessary for the
continuation of business operations.  When this funding occurs, we will be in a
position to render our opinion on the aforementioned financial statements.
